A Searching Study of Healing Without Drugs 

MENTAL MEDICINE 

By OLIVER HUCKEL. $1.00 net, postage 10 cents 
With an Introduction by Dr. L. F. BARKER, of Johns Hopkins Medical School 

The basis of this book is a series of lectures delivered by Dr. Huckel, a prominent 
clergyman of Baltimore, before the Johns Hopkins Medical School. They thus unite in 
audience and speaker the two professions most keenly interested in this new movement. 

The book is a clear, vigorous, practical treatment of a subject of the highest importance 
to both sick and well. The author recognizes cordially the best elements of Christian 
Science, but without its extravagances and inconsistencies. He also emphasizes the wisest 
teachings of the Emmanuel Movement, but without its clinics and hypnotic treatments. 

It is emphatically a book with a message. 



THOMAS Y. CROWELL & CO., NEW YORK 



" A memorial to the man, and a permanent part 
of the history of Chicago.' 1 

Essays and Addresses 

By EDWIN BURRITT SMITH 

' ' This volume contains the ripest thought of a man 
whose leading passion was the public good, one of 
the ablest lawyers and best citizens Chicago has pro- 
duced. Various as are the themes treated, the book 
has unity of spirit and purpose. It is a singularly 
clear and forceful statement of the vital principles on 
which all representative government must rest — in 
city, state, and nation — in order to be a success. 
The volume is well edited, is handsomely printed, and 
contains a photogravure portrait of the man whose 
fine personality it enshrines." 

— The Chicago Record-Herald. 

"The first 150 pages of this volume, dealing as 
they do with local issues of the greatest moment, 
deserve to be made a part of the history of Chicago, 
for they touch upon a movement than which nothing 
is more important — the awakening of a civic con- 
science." — The Chicago Tribune.

1909] THE DIAL, 



TWO VALUABLE LIBRARY BOOKS 



LETTERS FROM CHINA 

By SARAH PIKE CONGER 

(MRS. E. H. CONGER) 

" In range of observation and in fluency of descriptive narration she is not unlike Madame 
Waddington." — The Dial. 

" Fully as valuable as Mrs. Fraser's ' Letters from Japan,' or Mrs. Conger's ' Letters from 
China.' Her richly illustrated and well-indexed book is vivid and fascinating, and as a whole is 
likely to hold its own as a permanent contribution to our knowledge of China." — The Nation. 

''This is really one of the most important books on China that has appeared in recent 
years. ... It is quite wonderful how many elements of unique interest appear in this wholly 
admirable book, furnishing glimpses of the interior life and spirit, character and sentiment of 
the better Chinese homes." — The Tribune. 

" An extended view of Chinese life, delightful in its variety and important for its content. 
The book is indeed a delightful addition to our knowledge of a country of which no one 
nowadays can afford to be ignorant." — The Argonaut. 

With 80 illustrations and map. $2.75 net; postpaid, $2.95. 



THE ANDEAN LAND 

By CHASE S. OSBORN 

Member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan 

" In the course of an extended journey the author visited the chief cities along both 
coasts of South America, and he has set down his observations of men and affairs as he found 
them. His book will not only be entertaining reading, but there is a vast amount of infor- 
mation about the states and cities which he visited. He touches at length upon such topics as 
consuls, the errors of American exporters, railroads, grain inspection, international trade, mines, 
crops, markets, and social customs. His work is readable and instructive." — Chicago Tribune. 

" The work not only combines the informalities of a genial and venturesome traveler with 
the thoroughness and erudition of a student, but it fills a niche in the scanty literature on a 
country that has suffered a peculiar neglect. The work will therefore remain unique in value 
and interest for some time to come." — Detroit Journal. 

" The work is one which will speedily find a place in all public libraries and which no 
private library of any pretensions can afford to be without." — Daily Alining Journal. 

Two volumes, with 60 illustrations and four maps. Large 8vo. 
$5.00 net. By mail, $5.35.

A POETS MIND. 



The world at large has been acquainted with 
Swinburne the poet for nearly half a century. 
The acquaintance has not been improved in pro- 
portion to the opportunities offered, for of the 
line of some twoscore books that stretches from 
" The Queen Mother " of i860 to " The Duke 
of Gandia " of 1908 few have become widely 
read, and popular attention has been concen- 
trated upon only a small part, and that by no 
means the most significant, of the author's total 
achievement. Nevertheless, the name of the 
poet has long been upon the lips of most edu- 
cated persons, and numerous tags of his verse 
have become a part of the currency of literary 
conversation and criticism. Those who have 
desired to pursue the acquaintance, making it 
more comprehensive and substantial, have had 
access to an abundance of material, and the 
essential characteristics of the man who ex- 
pressed himself in the many books have been 
clearly discernible to all who have wished to 
know them. We are of those who believe that 
no writer, be he a Shakespeare — pace Robert 
Browning — or a Swinburne can successfully 
mask his true spiritual lineaments, or deceive 
his readers into thinking him other than he 
really is. It takes discernment, no doubt, and 
penetrative insight, to discover the man behind 
the book, but when we really come to know him 
our knowledge is of a deeper and truer sort than 
that which we have of most of the people with 
whom we come into the ordinary personal rela- 
tions of life. 

There is, however, in most of us a strong 
desire to supplement the deeper knowledge of a 
great poet that we may get from his books, by 
a certain amount of the other kind of knowledge 
that takes the form of anecdote, of personal 
idiosyncrasy, of intimate confession, of trick of 
speech and bearing. Having viewed him on 
parade, as it were, we like to see him also in 
fatigue uniform or in civilian dress. And, so 
prone are we to confuse accidents with essences, 
we do not realize how trivial or superficial all 
our added knowledge of this latter description 
must be, how relatively unimportant, in the case 
of a man who has already revealed to us his 
inmost soul. We may be glad to have it, and 



THE DIAL 



[July h 



it may have its proper function in our mental 
portraiture, but we must be careful not to let 
it fill the eye to the exclusion of the traits that 
really matter. All that the Great Monarch 
actually was — to take Thackeray's pointed illus- 
tration of the principle now in question — he 
must have been without perruque or sceptre, 
without any of the trappings of fashion or 
royalty. 

This exception taken, these qualifications 
allowed, we may express without further reserve 
the satisfaction given us by the four letters from 
Swinburne to Stedman that the London "Times" 
has recently made public. Few Swinburne 
letters have ever appeared in print, and few are 
likely to appear until the publication of Mr. 
Watts-Dunton's memoir; but permission has 
been granted for the printing of these four, 
which for the first time make the poet known in 
the intimate aspect of a personal correspondent. 
They were written in 1874-5, when Swinburne 
was 36-8 years of age, their recipient being 
some four years his senior. The first two relate 
mainly to Landor, being occasioned by Sted- 
man's volume of selections from that poet ; the 
other two are semi-autobiographical, being in 
response to a request by Stedman (just then at 
work upon his " Victorian Poets ") for such 
information as he might be permitted to use. 
Incidentally, they speak in a highly interesting 
way of some of the greater figures in American 
literature. What is particularly noteworthy in 
these letters is their gentle and self-effacing 
spirit, which is in sharp contrast to the arrogant 
dogmatism of Swinburne's published prose of a 
critical character. The truth seems to be that 
while he held to his critical convictions intensely, 
and did not mince matters in their statement, 
he was an excessively modest man in respect to 
his own achievements and his position in the 
world of letters. He could fiercely champion 
the cause of a writer whom he admired, but 
could hardly believe that those who praised his 
own writings really meant all that they said, or 
were at all justified in their admiration. 

This statement may be illustrated by the 
passage in which he speaks of the great elegy, 
" Ave atque Vale." 

" I am very glad you like my elegy on Baudelaire ; I 
wrote it with very sincere feelings of regret for the poor 
fellow's untimely loss, which gave it a tone of deeper 
thought or emotion than was called forth by the death 
of Gautier, with whom (though from boyhood almost 
his ardent admirer) I never had any correspondence; 
but in spite of your kind mention of it in this month's 
s Scribner's Magazine ' which I have just seen I cannot 
believe it worthy to tie the shoes (so to speak) of the 



least, whichever may be the least, of the great English 
triad or Trinity of elegies — Milton's, Shelley's, and 
Arnold's. I am content if it may be allowed to take its 
stand below the lowest of them, or to sit meekly at 
their feet." 

Again, speaking of his experiments in Greek 
and Latin verse, he says : 

" I confess that I take delight in the metrical forms 
of any language of which I know anything whatever, 
simply for the metre's sake, as a new musical instrument; 
and as soon as I can am tempted to try my hand or my 
voice at a new mode of verse, like a child trying to sing 
before it can speak plain. This is why without much 
scholarship I venture to dabble in classic verse and 
manage to keep afloat when in shallow water." 

"Without much scholarship!" this from the 
man who ranks with Jonson and Milton and 
Gray among the great English poets who have 
also been great scholars. It is, at least, not the 
language of egotism or even of self-confidence. 

What is said in these letters about the poets 
of America is in reply to Stedman's remon- 
strance concerning certain harsh observations 
found in " Under the Microscope." 

" Your rebuke on the subject of American poetry is 
doubtless as well deserved as it is kindly and gently ex- 
pressed. Yet I must say that while I appreciate (I hope) 
the respective excellence of Mr. Bryant's ' Thanatopsis ' 
and of Mr. Lowell's ' Commemoration Ode,' I cannot 
say that either of them leaves in my ear the echo of a 
single note of song. It is excellent good speech, but if 
given us as song its first and last duty is to sing. The 
one is most august meditation, the other a noble expres- 
sion of deep and grave patriotic feeling on a supreme 
national occasion ; but the thing more necessary, though 
it may be less noble than these, is the pulse, the fire, 
the passion of music — the quality of a singer, not of a 
solitary philosopher or a patriotic orator. Now, when 
Whitman is not speaking bad prose he sings, and when 
he sings at all he sings well. Mr. Longfellow has a 
pretty little pipe of his own, but surely it is very thin 
and reedy. Again, whatever may be Mr. Emerson's 
merits, to talk of his poetry seems to me like talking of 
the scholarship of a child who has not learnt its letters. 
Even Browning's verse always goes to a recognizable 
tune (I say not to a good one), but in the name of all 
bagpipes what is the tune of Emerson's ? " 

In the letter dated some six months later, he 
recurs to this subject. 

" I read your former letter very carefully and have 
since re-read a good deal of Emerson's first volume of 
poems therein mentioned, which certainly contains noble 
verses and passages well worth remembering. I hope 
that no personal feeling or consideration will ever pre- 
vent or impair my recognition of any man's higher 
qualities. In Whittier the power and pathos and 
righteousness (to use a great old word which should not 
be left to the pulpiteers) of noble emotion would be more 
enjoyable and admirable if he were not so deplorably 
ready to put up with the first word, good or bad, that 
comes to hand, and to run on long after he is out of 
breath." 

Now all this is genuine criticism, and its 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



substantial justice must be allowed. At least, 
no American not blinded by excess of patriot- 
ism can fairly deny that the critic's position is 
tenable if not absolutely secure. If only Swin- 
burne had printed these things, and left for 
private communication the petulant things that 
he did print about Emerson and Lowell and 
"Whittier (which his warmest admirers find it 
hard to forgive him), how much better it would 
have been ! 

The self -revelation afforded by these letters 
constitutes an even stronger claim to our interest 
than the critical comment. In external matters 
alone, it is extremely interesting to learn that 
Swinburne never spent more than a few weeks 
altogether in France and Italy, that he was a 
good cragsman as well as a good swimmer, and 
that he was once urged to stand for Parliament 
as a radical candidate, but was dissuaded by 
Mazzini, " the man I most loved and revered on 
earth," and felt greatly relieved. It is also 
interesting to learn the details of his Catholic 
and Jacobite ancestry, and to read that " when 
this race chose at last to produce a poet it would 
have been at least remarkable if he had been 
content to write nothing but hymns and idyls 
for clergymen and young ladies to read out in 
chapels and drawing rooms." We like to know, 
too, that he regarded " Hertha " as the best of 
his poems, and that he thought there was little 
" praiseworthy or notable " in that first volume 
of " Poems and Ballads " that had made him 
famous, and upon which (to the shame of criti- 
cism) the current estimate of Swinburne is still 
mainly based. 

Deepest of all in interest, perhaps, is the long 
passage (too long for complete quotation) which 
gives us the poet's confession of religious faith. 
Here is its more significant part : 

■ I always felt by instinct and perceived by reason 
that no man could conceive of a. personal God except by 
crude superstition or else by true supernatural revela- 
tion; that a natural God was the absurdest of all human 
figments, because no man could by other than apocalyptic 
means — i. e., by other means than a violation of the 
laws and order of nature — conceive of any other sort of 
Divine person than man with a difference — man with 
some qualities intensified and some qualities suppressed 
— man with the good in him exaggerated and the evil 
excised. This, I say, I have always seen and avowed 
since my mind was ripe enough to think freely. . . . But 
we who worship no material incarnation of any qualities, 
no person, may worship the Divine humanity, the ideal 
of human perfection and aspiration, without worshipping 
any god, any person, any fetish at all. Therefore I 
might call myself, if I wished, a kind of Christian (of 
the Church of Blake and Shelley) but assuredly in no 
sense a Theist. ... I think and hope that among the 



younger Englishmen who think at all just now Theism 
is tottering; Theism, which I feel to be sillier (if less 
dangerous) even than theology." 

This clean-cut statement should bring to per- 
manent confusion the criticasters who continue 
to prate about Swinburne as a poet of sound 
and fury only, whose intellect was a negligible 
quantity. As compared with it, whatever con- 
fession of faith we may find in either Browning 
or Tennyson (commonly taken as the typical 
modern poets of robust thought and reasoned 
belief) seems turbid or misty. Here is a poet 
who knows what he believes, and why he believes 
it. The faith thus confessed has always been 
implicit in Swinburne's song, and no one could 
read with intelligence " The Last Oracle," for 
example, and fail to understand its deep under- 
lying thought. 
"To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee, 

Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew ; 
Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee, 

Who wast older, O our father, than they knew. 
For no thought of man made Gods to love and honour 

Ere the song within the silent soul began, 
Xor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her 

Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of 
man." 

But to those for whom the verse is without 
meaning, the prose should be sufficiently clear. 

In token of the appeal which Swinburne 
makes as a religious prophet to minds not sealed 
by dogmatism, and of the positive aspect of a 
teaching which may seem merely negative at the 
first hearing, we will quote, in closing, these 
words from a letter recently sent us by a man 
who is an admirer of the poet, and also, signifi- 
cantly, a professional theologian. 

" Humanitarianism, the note of the living literature 
of this twentieth century, has its highest expression in 
Swinburne. Anthropology is central in Christian The- 
ology; it may be a matter of indifference to others, but 
the Christian must know, ' What is man ? ' One hun- 
dred years hence Swinburne's anthropology will provide 
the prosy platitudes of the schools of 'divines.' ... I 
am not a preacher with an eccentric literary taste ; I am 
for the diffusion of Swinburne because I am a minister 
of Jesus Christ and his fathomless gospel which dies 
when man fails of a just estimate of himself." 

It is perhaps the greatest service done us by the 
publication of these Swinburne letters that they 
justify such an attitude as that taken by our 
correspondent, that they show us the poet's mind 
expressing itself in terms of the plainest prose 
upon questions which have their dwelling-place 
only in the upper regions of the intellectual life, 
yet which it is vitally important that men should 
face, and find for them answers that fit into the 
pattern of modern knowledge.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A MARVEL OF LITERARY PRODUCTIVENESS ha8 

passed out from the company of toiling penmen ; and 
yet he was no toiling penman himself. If the 
attempt should ever he made to prepare a complete 
list of the late Edward Everett Hale's writings, the 
compiler would find his task a formidable one in- 
deed. A tentative check-list of the more important, 
and of some less important, products of Dr. Hale's 
rapid pen has recently appeared in a Boston news- 
paper, and its titles number two hundred and fifty- 
three. The Boston Public Library, the Boston 
Athenaeum, and the Harvard University Library fur- 
nished most of the data sought ; but a far wider and 
more thorough search would be required for any- 
thing like a complete bibliography. Probably not 
even the author himself could have drawn up a full 
list of his writings. A pamphlet on Texas immi- 
gration is mentioned in his autobiography as one of 
his earliest publications, but no Boston library has it, 
and one questions whether Dr. Hale himself could 
have laid his hand on a copy. The wide range of 
his literary activities is illustrated by even a partial 
list of his works.. He wrote on the " Cosmogony of 
Dante and Columbus," a paper on " Coronado's 
Discovery of the Seven Cities," an account of " The 
Fall of the Stuarts," something about " Emigration 
of Women to Oregon," and fiction and fable, poetry 
and sermon, in endless variety. The number of 
points at which he touched the world was all but 
infinite, and the large humanity of the man grows 
upon us with every day that passes since his death. 

Some of Dr. Hale's sayings and counsels, as 
they are now being reported, are characteristic and 
full of common sense. " I am especially gratified," 
he is reported to have said on one occasion, " over 
the organization of a boys' society in the State of 
Maine. Their motto is 'Patience,' and they call it 
the D. G. M. Club, which, translated, means the 
Don't Get Mad Club. That ought to be the motto 
of every person and nation on the earth." " Three 
hours' dictation is enough for any man engaged in 
literary labor. It should begin at 9.30 o'clock in 
the morning, behind a locked door, with a secretary 
who knows more than you do and can spell. At half- 
past twelve, as I once said, you may open your doors 
and let the wildcats, or the tame, rush in. Attend 
to the business of your callers in the afternoon, and 
get out into the open. In the evening play cards in 
your family, read, but not too much, go to see your 
friends, let them come to see you, or there may be a 
good play at the theatre/' " My advice to every one 
is to live out of doors as much as possihle. A healthy 
man should walk six miles a day without fatigue. 
But a dozen miles in an open street car or buggy is 
just as well, I think. The air and sun are what one 
needs." '• Good sleep is the first necessity for health 
and labor. If for any cause you lose sleep, be sure 
to make it up. Maintain the average " — which in 



his case was nine hours ; but not all have Morpheus 
so submissively at their beck and call, at any time of 
day or night, as our cheerful and optimistic and 
equable Dr. Hale appears to have had.

Dana Estes, publisher, traveller, archae- 
ologist, a veteran of the Civil War, sometime 
secretary of the International Copyright Asssciation, 
and otherwise a man of note and of varied experience, 
died at his home in Brookline, Mass., June 16, at the 
age of sixty-nine. Born and educated at Gorham, 
Maine, and trained in business at Augusta, and from 
the age of nineteen in Boston, he made himself 
prominent and successful as a book-publisher. He 
was associated, first and last, with the Boston firms 
of Degen, Estes & Co., Lee & Shepard, Estes & 
Lauriat, and Dana Estes & Co. Historical works of 
value, published by subscription, were his speciality ; 
and Guizot's and Martin's histories of France, Duruy 's 
histories of Greece and Rome, besides editions of 
leading European novelists^ were issued in handsome 
and substantial form by his house. The " Zig-Zag 
Journey " series under Hezekiah Butterworth's 
editorship, the u Knockabout Club " series, the 
" Vassar Girl " series, the popular stories of Mrs. 
Laura E. Richards (daughter of Mrs. Howe), the 
scarcely less popular cook-books of Miss Maria 
Parloa, and the remarkably successful American 
edition of " The Chatterbox," were also among Mr. 
Estes's widely-known publications. It was the nearly 
ten years' litigation over the exclusive American 
right to the " Chatterbox " title (a claim finally made 
good at the cost of almost $30,000) that paved the 
way to Mr. Estes's organization of the Copyright 
Association above mentioned. Of his travels in 
Africa and elsewhere, and his interest in palaeon- 
tology and archaeology, there is not space here to 
speak. Mr. Estes was a good example of the 
enlightened and broad-minded publisher of the old 
school. t t t 

The three days' festival in honor of 
Frederic Mistral, the beloved poet of Provence, 
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the publica- 
tion of his poem " Mireio," is reported to have been 
a complete success. To few men is it given to hear 
their own funeral orations, and to scarcely more is it 
granted to assist at the unveiling of their own statues. 
But this latter happiness has fallen to the lot of the 
greatly beloved poet of Provence. Yet the singular 
event was to him, in prospectu, a trying ordeal. A 
few weeks ago he wrote to a friend : " Pity me ! To 
assist at the unveiling of my own statue is the most 
uncomfortable task that could fall to my share ; I 
would exchange all these fetes for a simple lunch 
with two or three dear friends under the white pop- 
lars beside the Rhone." Nevertheless, when the day 
arrived, it proved to be one of exceeding joy to all 
concerned, including the central figure. The museum 
of antiquities, newly housed in the ancient palace of 
Laval, which the poet had bought with the proceeds 
of his Nobel prize and given to Aries, was formally 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



opened to the public : and this and the other events 
of the festival were witnessed by enthusiastic throngs 
of the poet's admirers. The publication, a year and 
a half ago. of M. Mistral's Memoirs, in English as 
well as French, must have won him many new friends 
in this country, where he is pleasantly remembered 
by older readers through Miss Preston's charming 
version of his ' ; Mireio," published in Boston over 
thirty years ago. 

A NEW EPOCH OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMEXT IX 

Califorxia is entered upon with the passage by 
the last legislature of the bill providing for a county 
library system throughout the state. This is a direct 
result of the admirable work done by the State Li- 
brary, within the last few years, in the extension, 
improvement and coordination of library facilities ; 
and its effect in time will be to weld the public libra- 
ries of the state into practically a single cooperative 
organization, centring in the State Library. The 
new law is permissive and elastic, and libraries may 
enter the county system or not, according to local 
preference ; but the intention of the act is that the 
leading public library of a county shall assume the 
functions of a county library, extending its privi- 
leges freely to all residents and having supervision 
of the smaller libraries within its field. This will 
greatly improve the condition of the school district 
libraries, now often moribund, which as branches of 
a live county system will be revived to usefulness. 
Good support of the system is assured through a 
special county tax, and this additional appropriation 
will undoubtedly be an inducement to libraries to 
enter the county system. An interesting feature is 
the provision that no person shall be eligible for 
appointment as county librarian who is not certified 
as qualified for the position by the State Librarian, 
or the librarian of Stanford University, or the libra- 
rian of the State university — this being evidently a 
portent of a future system of state certification for 
librarians, such as now prevails for teachers. In- 
deed, this law is striking evidence of the growing 
feeling that public libraries should be put more 
nearly on a plane with public schools, especially as 
regards financial maintenance and salaries paid, 
than is the case at present. 

A XEW DEPARTURE LX ExGLISH PROSE COMPO- 

srriox. as required for admission to Harvard, was 
made about a year ago, when candidates were per- 
mitted to write either on one of the prescribed liter- 
ary topics or on a subject of current and practical 
interest for which they had not laboriously crammed. 
"While three-quarters of the would-be freshmen 
followed what was perhaps for them the safer course 
and expatiated on " The Appearance and Character 
of Dr. Johnson," not a few burned their bridges 
behind them and pushed forward boldly into the 
terra incognita, or terra parum cognita, of sponta- 
neous literary effort. From an interesting leaflet 
entitled "The Xew Examinations," just published 
by the New England Association of Teachers of 



English, we learn that among the topics not taken 
from the prescribed reading were some of this sort, — 
u The effect of the game of football on the school of 
which you have been a member during the past 
year," " Your reasons for your choice of a college," 
and " What subjects you plan to study in college, and 
your reasons for choosing them." Here, evidently, 
was matter for independent thought, and the non- 
literary essays printed in the leaflet display far more 
individuality than could have been exhibited in any 
rechauffe of prescribed book-knowledge. The youth 
who dared to denounce interscholastic football, and 
the one who pleaded its cause, each wrote with force 
and conviction. If a lad cannot take an interest in 
the things of literature, it is hopeless to expect any 
live utterance from him on Dr. Johnson ; better let 
him express himself on a humbler theme and one 
nearer home. . . . 

A bllxd leader of the bllxd is now attract- 
ing attention in the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy. 
Miss Helen Keller publishes a letter giving her 
experience in the absorbing game of acrostic-chasing. 
" I copied the pages from the Shakespeare text 
literatim," she tells us, " so that I could trace them 
with the ten eyes of my fingers ; " and her findings 
are thought by Mr. Booth's disciples to be of super- 
lative importance. Miss Keller's marvellous powers 
of intuition, abnormally developed by the peculiari- 
ties of her condition, render most interesting and 
significant this participation of hers in the otherwise 
tiresome and often foolish discussion. Yet it should 
be borne in mind that no sense is more easily deceived 
or more responsive to suggestion than the sense of 
touch. The ten eyes of the fingers (to use Miss 
Keller's apt and poetic expression) easily see what 
they wish to see, or what they are expected to see. 
This gullibility of the touch-sense was well known 
to Aristotle ( to go no further back), and is illustrated 
by the ancient experiment of crossing the index and 
second fingers and gently pressing the surface of a 
globule with their tips, whereupon the eyes of these 
two fingers see two globules instead of one. This 
illustration may not be the aptest possible ; but what 
it is desirable to remember is that it belongs to the 
very nature of illusion, when it is seeking to establish 
itself as truth, to call forth from many quarters an 
astonishing number of what the credulous hail as 
convincing proofs. ... 

The late Coloxel Alexander K. McClure, 
whose death last month carried sorrow to his many 
friends and regret to his still more numerous admir- 
ers and readers and hearers (for he was a familiar 
figure on the platform and a widely-read author of 
historical, biographical, and autobiographical vol- 
umes) had. in his eighty-one years of actively useful

and the Men of his Time," " Our Presidents and 
How We Make Them," « Recollections of Half a 
Century," " Old Time Notes of Pennsylvania," and 
other works, including several books of travel in his 
own country. The friend and comrade of such 
famous old Pennsylvanians as Tom Scott, Editor 
Forney, Simon Cameron, Samuel Randall, Judge 
Kelley, and Galusha Grow, he was a sturdy and 
picturesque figure in the public life of his State. It 
is pleasant to remember that when the newspaper 
he owned and so ably edited — a paper apparently 
too good for its time and place — suspended publi- 
cation and left Colonel McClure without means, he 
was fittingly provided for by being appointed pro- 
thonotary, having in early life made acquaintance 
with the law and been admitted to the bar. Few 
books of miscellaneous reminiscences are more inter- 
esting than his " Recollections." 

The " glorious Fourth " as an index of our 
civilization is most certainly an ignominious 
Fourth. The historical and literary and musical 
programme that might furnish the day's festivities, 
and that did formerly constitute the chief feature of 
its celebration, has now been mostly superseded by 
demoniac din and senseless racket, with a melan- 
choly train of deaths and mutilations and conflagra- 
tions to lend lurid horror to the newspaper columns 
of the next morning. A society for the intelligent 
observance of our natal day has, indeed, been formed, 
and all over the land an encouraging reaction against 
our present puerile and dangerous and costly method 
of making merry is manifesting itself. The city of 
Springfield, Mass., has already achieved noteworthy 
results, its patriotic citizens subscribing generously 
to furnish young and old with a series of pageants 
or historic spectacles that dignify the day and leave 
no mangled limbs or blackened ruins behind. And 
now we learn that our national capital has adopted 
the safe and sensible Fourth-of-July plan and is rais- 
ing a considerable sum for a suitable public enter- 
tainment, in furnishing which the board of trade, 
the chamber of commerce, and the school committee 
are cooperating. Let now the mischievous fire- 
cracker and the nerve-racking torpedo pass into 
innocuous desuetude. 

The blessings of liberal library support 
are often more than are " covenanted in the bond." 
Some of these are briefly touched upon in the 
Aurora (111.) Public Library's monthly publication, 
" The Library Guide." " Material results," says the 
writer, whom we assume to be the librarian, "are 
often a sort of by-product of a well-managed public 
library. It is thought that the public libraries of 
Springfield and Worcester, Mass., have done their 
full share in promoting the industries of those cities 
by supplying books that have stimulated invention, 
leading to improved processes, better methods, and 
often-times to new devices. In this way those insti- 
tutions have paid for themselves over and over, as 
have other well managed libraries." The indirect 



commercial benefit accruing to Aurora from her 
excellent public library is then considered. It 
appears that the library draws visitors and readers 
and book-borrowers from many of the surrounding 
towns, and the inference is safe that this influx of 
strangers (from no fewer than sixteen neighboring 
towns in " the last few months ") brings at least a 
little increase of trade to Aurora's shop-keepers. 
Here is an argument calculated to appeal even to 
the most un-bookloving of finance committees when 
the annual appeal for a public-library appropriation 
has to be made. . . . 

The domain of unremunerative authorship 
is a large one, and there is always ample elbow-room 
and opportunity there for fresh aspirants to obscur- 
ity and poverty, fame and fortune being the irre- 
sistible lure to the great throng. Mr. Andrew Lang, 
in his after-dinner remarks at the recent banquet of 
the Royal Literary Fund, in London, specified as 
particularly unprofitable (in pecuniary returns) the 
departments of history, poetry, essays, literary criti- 
cism, and anthropology, and advised young writers 
to give their energies to fiction, although even here 
he acknowledged the prospect to be rather dark. 
The rich, he declared, who deny themselves nothing 
else, persist in denying themselves books, and even 
the popular novels are not bought by individuals in 
any great number — not over twenty per cent, in his 
opinion. The seven-penny novel he is reported as 
likening to the sword of Damocles in its menace to 
the young novelist's success. Mr. Lang might have 
greatly lengthened his list of pecuniarily unprofitable 
-ologies ; but nevertheless we hope the geologists, 
ornithologists, entomologists, and even the ontolo- 
gists, will not abandon their researches and give us 
no more books. Man cannot subsist on a diet of 
pure fiction. . . . 

A sign of promise from Iowa catches the eye 
in the current issue of the "Iowa Library Quarterly," 
a sixteen-page periodical published by the Iowa 
Library Commission. The town of Shenandoah, 
which is credited in the latest census with 3573 
inhabitants, seems more appreciative of its Sunday 
opportunity to visit the public library than do many 
larger and perhaps more cultured communities of 
the East. Concerning a recent Sunday attendance 
we read : " Sixty-seven young men and 34 young 
women visited the library from 2:20 to 5:30 o'clock, 
a total of 101. It was almost universally true that 
every one came in quietly, immediately went to a 
table or shelf, and continued occupied in reading 
until he left. . . . Almost the entire number who 
came in were under twenty-four years of age " — 
the very time of life when Sunday afternoon is apt 
to seem designed primarily for other than literary 
uses. Almost coincident with this bit of news from 
the prairie, there comes an encouraging item from 
Massachusetts : the Boston Public Library has re- 
cently lengthened its Sunday hours, closing now at 
ten instead of nine o'clock. They might easily do 
worse, both in Boston and in Iowa.

COMMUNICA TIOXS. 



MAKING PRINTED MATTER EASIER TO READ. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Until the half-tone plate as a means of illustration 
became popular, bringing with it the clay-coated shining 
printing surfaces to show off its deUcate shadings on the 
paper, we heard comparatively little about eye-strain. 
That the highly-finished papers do cause distress to 
readers, is generally admitted. Now we have the activ- 
ities of the Boston Society of Printers directed to a 
reform in the shape of individual letters. Some of the 
letters of the alphabet are " proved by laboratory tests " 
to be "offenders" (quoting from an editorial in The 
Dial). Before accepting the asserted proof, it is, I 
think, reasonable to inquire into the character of the 
laboratory tests. If the letter O is placed before me 
and its distance from me gradually increased to the 
vanishing-point, I may be able to recognize it at a 
greater distance than the letter E, and these tests may 
be in groups of words or in single letters. But in read- 
ing, I do not examine the letters so intently, except as a 
proofreader on the alert for wrong fonts. It is the 
" word-shape " I read, not the letter-shape. Most 
printers " spell by sight." Ask some of them to spell 
an unusual word, and they are not quite sure until they 
set it up and look at it or write it. The shape of the 
word is their guide. 

Research, particularly the research of the Boston 
Society of Printers, has many fascinations, and that they 
have found many " bad characters " in the types may be 
subject for congratulation as by such process of elimi- 
nation they may find the good ones. The inference is 
that they will advise making the bad ones as much like 
the good ones as possible? Will not distinction be lost? 
Will not the subtle word-shape be lost? It may not be 
freely admitted by the experienced that the purpose of 
printed matter is to convey thought, but it may be cau- 
tiously admitted as a philosophical truth. Type mod- 
elled on the lettering of 'the ancient scriveners, or on the 
styles used by the fathers of the printing art, it is almost 
profane to criticise — perhaps. Mr. Bruce Rogers goes 
back to the fountain-head of the art for inspiration in 
developing taste and style in modern typography. In all 
the classic forms of alphabets esteemed by the elect, the 
■ bad characters " in the letter forms, according to my 
idea of the "laboratory tests," must be exceedingly bad. 

The Printers' Society of Boston appears to be working 
against the influences of the vicarious inspiration of Mr. 
Bruce Rogers. The suggestion that a Roman inscrip- 
tion would be more legible if a Greek character should 
be used in place of one or more of the Roman characters, 
is new. The fun that the average citizen delights to 
make of monumental inscriptions with the classic V's 
instead of U's is modern but not new. 

That the weight of the lines of certain type forms 
make legibility great or less, we all know. The biblio- 
phile delights in type that is to be looked at but not 
read. The newspaper reader and magazine reader will 
be quite content if the spiky Jenson, the graceful old- 
style with the high ascenders and low descenders, 
obscure thinnesses and obtrusive thicknesses, are con- 
fined to those who want books to look at. For them- 
selves, they ask a good full-bodied letter with an honest 
printing face as the means of carrying the predigested 
mental food suited to their dyspeptic condition.

DIPROYEMENTS IN TYPE DESIGN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The views upon typographical reform, expressed by 
Mr. George French in The Dial of June 16, will be 
echoed by all who have studied the subject closely, and 
especially by those who have had experience in the diffi- 
cult task of designing new type-faces. 

Improvements in type design are possible only within 
very narrow limits. The time for making any radical 
alteration in the Roman alphabet has long gone by. 
Even the introduction of a single novel letter would not 
be tolerated if its use should change in any marked 
degree the appearance of the words containing it. Those 
who have tried to decipher early seventeenth-century 
handwriting, and know how long it takes to become 
sufficiently accustomed to the inverted h so that the 
words in which it occurs can be grasped by the eye 
without working them out letter by letter, will appre- 
ciate the force of this statement. The substitution of 
the Greek lambda for the present lower-case I, as pro- 
posed by Dr. Cattell, is objectionable upon this ground, 
and also because it would introduce an inharmonious 
character into the alphabet and so spoil the beauty of 
any page upon which it might be used. The effect 
would be somewhat analogous to the use of the italic I 
in place of the vertical letter. 

That some letters can be read at a greater distance 
than others is incontestable. Yet were all of those now 
in use discarded, and the entire alphabet reconstructed 
upon scientific lines, it is scarcely conceivable that a new 
set could be invented, each and every letter of which 
would be equally legible at any given distance. It is 
easy to overestimate the eye-strain induced by these 
inevitable differences. Laboratory tests will be of little 
value if they ignore the fact that, in reading, the indi- 
vidual letters are scarcely noted. Even when one con- 
sciously tries to look at them closely, as in reading 
proof, it is hard to do so, since we are accustomed to 
see words, phrases, and sometimes sentences, as units. 

While this comprehensive view is facilitated by the 
arrangement of the words upon the printed page, the 
length of the lines, the spacing between them, the color 
of the ink, the sharpness of the impression, the texture 
of the paper, and other refinements that enter into good 
printing, the character of the type is also of prime 
importance. Optically, the ideal type is that which 
enables the eye to take in most at a glance. This 
means that the entire font must be free from any dis- 
tracting feature however slight. So small a thing as a 
slightly exaggerated serif upon a single letter is quite 
enough to impair the effect of the type when seen as a 
page. Rigorously severe simplicity is an inexorable 
requirement. Furthermore, the " set " of the letters 
must be so adjusted that in every possible combination, 
the words will look right. 

For these reasons, the designer soon discovers that 
there is very little scope for innovations. The fact is, 
the Roman alphabet was so thoroughly studied in the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the proportions 
of each letter were worked out so carefully, that no sub- 
stantial improvement has since been devised. This, how- 
ever, does not imply that no modification is possible. It 
is no doubt worth while that the scientific tests should be 
made and be given the widest possible range. I shall be 
surprised if they do not show that the most beautf ul types 
are also the easiest to read, and that what is called for 
is improvement in the types used in machine composition.

Some Old Familiar Faces.* 

Looking back from the vantage-ground of 
his mature age — which (if he will pardon the 
innocent pun) is as a lusty winter, kindly and 
not frosty — Mr. William Winter is favoring 
his readers with a series of informal recollec- 
tions of old friends who have won fame on the 
stage or with the pen. His agreeable memories 
of actors, recently published in book form under 
the title "Other Days," are speedily followed 
by similar reminiscences of authors, first printed 
in part in the " Saturday Evening Post," and 
now collected and enlarged and named "Old 
Friends : being Literary Recollections of Other 
Days." 

The famous names of that golden age of 
American literature, the middle and later nine- 
teenth century, that so attractively besprinkle 
Mr. Winter's pages are Longfellow, Poe, Holmes, 
Aldrich, Taylor, Curtis, Lowell, Stedman Stod- 
dard, and others of less renown. Some English 
authors, notably Dickens and Wilkie Collins, 
are introduced ; and more than once Mr. William 
Winter himself, in poem or personal anecdote or 
half-tone portrait, is made to contribute to the 
reader's entertainment. To begin our quoted 
selections with one having to do chiefly with the 
author himself, here is a picture of him deliver- 
ing a poem before the Society of the Army of 
the Potomac, at the Philadelphia Academy of 
Music in 1876. 

" The scene, as I recall it, presented a superb pageant 
of life and color. There was a multitudinous audience. 
The stage was thronged with men renowned in war 
and eminent in peace. General Hancock presided. My 
seat was at the left of that commander, and on my left 
sat General Sherman. ... I have addressed many au- 
diences, but never an audience more eagerly responsive 
and generously enthusiastic than that assemblage of 
members of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. 
When I returned to my seat, after the delivery of my 
poem, every person upon the stage was standing; the 
house was ringing with cheers ; General Sherman caught 
me in his arms, with fervent feeling: and, as to the suc- 
cess of the effort, it is enough for me to remember that, 
from that day till the day of his death, that great man 
remained my friend." 

First in his book, and apparently foremost in 
Mr. Winter's admiration and grateful homage, 
stands the poet Longfellow, whose acquaintance 
the author made as a youth, before going to seek 
his fortune with his pen in New York. His 
hearty tribute to his early patron as America's

greatest poet is refreshing in an age when, as he 
complains, no name in literature is uttered with 
that accent of profound respect and sincere 
admiration that trembled on the tongue of his 
contempories fifty years ago when the leading 
men of letters were mentioned. Some of Mr. 
Winter's reasons for ascribing supremacy to his 
old friend are as follows : 

" A reason for thinking Longfellow is the foremost of 
American poets is the belief that he was more objective 
than any of the other bards, and was elementally actu- 
ated by an impulse of greater and broader design. . . . 
Another reason why Longfellow stands foremost among 
our poets is that he possessed and manifested a more 
comprehensive, various, and felicitous command of verbal 
art than has been displayed by any other American poet; 
while still another is that he speaks with a voice that is 
more universal than personal. ' Evangeline,' ' The Build- 
ing of the Ship,' ' The Golden Legend,' « The Saga of 
King Olaf,' ' Tales of a Wayside Inn,' and ' Hiawatha ' 
are works that illumine the general imagination, express 
the general human heart, and are freighted with the 
general life of man." 

Anecdotes illustrating the poet's keen sense 
of humor, even when the laugh was against him, 
follow in some abundance, and other amiable 
traits of the man are touched upon. His kindli- 
ness and his all but invariable custom of saying 
nothing but good of his fellow-craftsmen, and 
indeed of all men whatsoever, might perhaps 
have been advantageously imitated by his eulo- 
gist in that part of his book that treats of Walt 
Whitman. The latter 's peculiarities are well 
enough known by this time, and Mr. Winter's 
catalogue of his offences seems hardly called for. 
Selecting a few lines from the milder portion of 
the author's censure, we will quote. 

" The writings of Walt Whitman, in so far as they 
are anything, are philosophy: they certainly are not 
poetry : and they do not possess even the merit of an 
original style ; for Macpherson, with his « Ossian ' for- 
geries; Martin Farquhar Tupper, with his ' Proverbial 
Philosophy,' and Samuel Warren, with his tumid < Ode,' 
were extant long before the advent of Whitman. Fur- 
thermore, Plato's writings were not unknown; while the 
brotherhood of man had been proclaimed in Judea, with 
practical consequences that are still obvious. No author 
has yet made a vehicle of expression that excels, in any 
way whatever, or for any purpose, the blank verse of 
Shakespeare and Milton. In the hands of any artists 
who can use them, the old forms of expression are abun- 
dantly adequate, and so, likewise, are the old subjects; 
at all events, nobody has yet discovered any theme more 
fruitful than the human heart, human experience, man 
in his relation to Nature and to God." 

With the last clause, Whitman himself would 
undoubtedly have been in hearty agreement. 
But in the main this estimate of the " good gray 
poet " seems hardly likely to be confirmed by 
the verdict of posterity. 

Some of Mr. Winter's explanatory remarks

seem to be designed for very young readers. A 
half-page devoted to recounting a few of the 
main facts of Margaret Fuller's life, upon in- 
troduction of her name, seems, to the ordinarily 
intelligent reader of the book, like so much 
padding, however appropriate it may have been 
in the columns of the " Post." Also, his pro- 
fuse notes of admiration whenever he chances to 
mention Scott are not exactly indispensable to 
the enjoyment of his chapters, however cordially 
one may share his enthusiasm for that prince of 
romancers. 

One of the best chapters in Mr. Winter's 
book is that on Aldrich, who has but so lately 
left us. The friendship between the two began 
even before they had seen each other, and was 
strengthened by frequent letters that passed 
between Cambridge and New York. Strikingly 
characteristic of the youth who was afterward to 
produce u Marjorie Daw " is the subjoined ex- 
tract from one of his friendly missives to the yet 
unseen correspondent in New England. 

" How sweet is the letter that comes to a sick-room, 
fresh from the hand of a very dear though unseen friend! 
And how sweet it is, when one is just convalescent 
enough to sit before a comfortable writing-desk and lan- 
guidly hang thoughts, like a week's washing (pardon the 
homely comparison), upon a line, to watch ' the swell 
mob of characters,' as Tom Hood says, creep gradually 
over the page! This pleasure is mine now, dear Winter, 
and a sort of dreamy joy comes over me, when I think 
how very soon your eyes will run over these lines, — 
almost following the point of my pen. How odd that 
I have never seen you! How strange that we have 
looked into each other's hearts, and never touched a 
hand or exchanged a glance ! If we should never meet, 
I shall always think of you as one of the delicious 
phantoms which have, before now, flitted through the 
heaven of my fancy, leaving me only a dim conjecture 
of what it might have been. I cannot see you; but I 
can send you my mind, the better part of me, which 
cannot be taken away." 

A welcome variety is given to Mr. Winter's 
pages by the occasional and graceful introduc- 
tion of a poem or part of a poem from his pen. 
Especially good is the threnody that concludes 
his chapter on George William Curtis ; and the 
brief extract he gives from his tribute to Dr. 
Holmes on the occasion of the Autocrat's seven- 
tieth birthday makes one desire the remainder. 
However, his poetical works are not difficult of 
access. A serious disfigurement of so excellent 
and handsome a volume is to be noted in the 
many misprints, if such they are to be called. 
The Craigie house in Cambridge is repeatedly 
referred to as the Cragie house, and thus it 
stands even in the index, which also gives 
Whiteman for Whitman, and is further vitiated 
by unalphabetic arrangement. Page 247 con- 



tains a jumbling of lines, or an insertion of 
foreign matter, that makes nonsense. Absolute 
accuracy is not expected in a volume of ram- 
bling reminiscences ; but it is desirable that it 
shall be capable of being read without stum- 
bling. The portraits are many and good, and 
the typography is luxurious in its generous size 
and open arrangement.

The Search for the AVesterx Sea.* 

Canada is charged with new energy ; a new 
spirit is animating her. Thousands of emigrants 
have been attracted to her shores and are settling 
upon the great plains of her Greater Northwest. 
She is building railroads ; she is planning a deep 
waterway system to the sea. This new energy 
is not exhausted in the pursuit of material advan- 
tages ; it has infused itself into the spirit of 
scholarship as well. The group of students who 
have been educated at Canadian and foreign 
universities are filled with enthusiasm for their 
fatherland, and are making themselves a power 
in the world of science and letters. Particularly 
is this the case in the field of history. The recent 
reorganization of the Canadian Archives is a sign 
of this vita nuova. The enterprise for which 
that institution stands has attracted the best 
minds of Canada ; systematic efforts are being 
made to gather into the new building erected 
by the government all the material that bears 
upon the past of the Dominion, and the institu- 
tion is becoming more and more the centre of 
research in Canadian history. Mr. Burpee's 
volume upon the search for the path westward 
to the sea is undoubtedly inspired by this new 
life. Its contents will attract the attention of 
all those who are interested in the Canadian 
Northwest, whether that interest is scientific, 
commercial, or otherwise ; for it is the first 
adequate and scientific treatment of that won- 
derful story of the western fur-traders who, in 
their search for gain and their love of adventure, 
penetrated mile by mile along the water-courses 
until the foot of the mountains were reached : 
and then, led on by their enthusiasm, crossed 
the rocky peaks and canoed down the rivers to 
the Pacific Ocean. 

The attention of the European world was first 
called to the Hudson Bay by the explorer after

whom it was named, and the first interest in 
that body of water was inspired by the hope of 
finding an open waterway through the continent 
of America to the Indies. It was not until the 
eighteenth century was almost ended that this 
hope was entirely abandoned. Mr. Burpee has 
traced in a careful and scholarly manner the 
various enterprises, from the time of Henry 
Hudson to the appearance of those volumes by 
Arthur Dobbs which were written for the pur- 
pose of arousing an interest on the part of the 
public in an enterprise which was already known 
to be hopeless. If one desires to trace the history 
of this search, as undertaken by the Company 
of the Merchants of the London Discoverers of 
the Northwest Passage, or of the Hudson Bay 
Company, to follow the incidents that occurred 
in the voyages of such men as Hudson, Button, 
Baffin, Fox, Hull, and James, it will be impos- 
sible to find a more satisfactory work than this 
by Mr. Burpee. 

A second phase of the search opened when 
the Hudson Bay Company and its agents began 
to explore the courses of the rivers. Strangely 
enough, the men who controlled the Hudson Bay 
Company realized only very late in the life of that 
company the necessity of sending their agents 
into the interior. For years they lived in the hope 
that the Indians from the far West would come 
to the seacoast in order to purchase their wares. 
Their earlier explorations were undertaken by 
their traders almost independently, and largely 
on account of their love of adventure. Later, 
the success of their rivals from the French colony 
of Nouvelle-France, who were the first to reach 
the region around Lake Winnipeg, aroused the 
English company. These earlier explorations 
of the Hudson Bay Company are carefully 
described by Mr. Burpee. Thus he traces the 
wanderings of Henry Kellsey, and attempts to 
fix definitely the path by which that wandergeist 
penetrated into the interior. More successful 
is his account of Anthony Hendry, because the 
material for tracing the path of this first 
Englishman to reach the Saskatchewan is more 
ample. He has followed step by step the 
course of Samuel Hearne, who found the path 
northward to the Coppermine River, along 
which Sir John Franklin was to pass many 
years later. 

Having discussed in the first part the enter- 
prises of the English from Hudson Bay, Mr. 
Burpee turns to the French discoveries along 
what he calls the " southern gateway," which 
leads from the St. Lawrence and the Great 
Lakes. It was through this gateway that the 



search for the western sea was to be successful, 
for the only route to that will-o-the-wisp of so 
many voyagers was along the network of inter- 
nal waterways across a wide continent. Mr. 
Burpee does not repeat the often told story of 
the early discoveries of Champlain, but begins 
his continuous narrative with the search beyond 
the Great Lakes. From these internal seas the 
French penetrated to the Greater Northwest 
and reached the waters that flow into Lake 
Winnipeg. Without doubt, the most interest- 
ing chapter in the book is that devoted to the 
wanderings of the most daring explorer of all 
the pioneers — the Frenchman La Verendrye, 
who was the first of Europeans to catch sight 
of the Rocky Mountains. The material illus- 
trating his explorations has been gone over with 
great care by Mr. Burpee, and his account will 
stand as one of the most authoritative that has 
yet been written. 

When, by the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, 
France withdrew from North America and gave 
up to her English rivals Nouvelle-France and 
the country east of the Mississippi, the knowl- 
edge of the West that had been gained by the 
French voyageurs and coureurs de bois became 
a part of the British acquisitions. From this 
time onward, however, the French Canadians 
were the able guides of the English explorers. 
The British merchants followed rapidly on the 
footsteps of their English soldiers in taking 
possession of the field. Alexander Henry ac- 
tually reached Mackinac earlier than the British 
soldiers, and was soon ready to push farther 
westward. Jonathan Carver, whose credit as 
explorer is about as suspicious as that of Father 
Hennepin, aroused the interest of the English 
by printing his travels ; and this book inspired 
many of his readers with the hope of reaching 
the Pacific by the new passage. The Hudson 
Bay Company, hitherto satisfied with its few 
expeditions into the interior, was aroused to 
new vigor, first by the independent traders from 
Montreal, and then by the association of these 
traders into the Northwest Company. This new 
company, founded in 1785, contained men of 
tremendous enterprise, ability, and daring, — 
such as Peter Pond, Alexander Henry, and the 
Mackenzies. It was one of these last named, 
Alexander Mackenzie, who was finally to com- 
plete the exploration and reach the Pacific. 
The search was then ended. Trade and love 
of adventure had been the motives that had led 
generations of explorers westward until the goal 
was reached. 

On the whole, great praise can be given to Mr.

Burpee's narrative, and the scholar will unques- 
tionably turn to this volume for an authoritative 
statement of what actually occurred during any 
one of these numerous explorations. Unfor- 
tunately, however, the scholar will look in vain 
for references in the footnotes. Here and there 
Mr. Burpee has indicated the source from which 
he has drawn his story ; but only occasionally. 
For the most part the reader is left to infer that 
he has gathered his material from manuscript 
journals or printed material, but is rarely given 
the satisfaction of knowing exactly what these 
are or where they are to be found. It is true 
that Mr. Burpee furnishes at the close of the 
volume a bibliography that will be found very 
useful to the student of this subject, but it is 
hardly sufficient to excuse this conspicuous 
neglect. 

The style of the narrative is not what would 
be called u animated." In fact, it moves along 
so quietly that one finds it occasionally monot- 
onous ; but possibly it is this particular quality 
that gives us the feeling that we are reading the 
work of a scholar. There is never any attempt 
to pick out dramatic incidents for their own 
sake, no straining to picture with the aid of the 
imagination a course of events that may or may 
not have occured. Mr. Burpee has stuck to the 
texts which he has used, and the truth of his 
narrative is his goal.

Beethovex, Hero of Moderx Music* 

That extraordinary man, Ludwig van Beetho- 
ven, a new edition of whose letters here comes 
under review, was a hero in Carlyle's sense if 
ever there was one. A rugged impetuous spirit, 
caring very little for the conventionalities, an 
untamed man, as Goethe calls him, radical in 
his views of art and life, he was exactly calcu- 
lated to bring about the transformation which 
has made modern music what it is. The opera 
had been brought by Gluck to a realization of 
the importance of the dramatic situation and the 
need that it should be reflected in music capably 
and thoroughly ; Bach had exploited the great 
resources of the art, and had built up edifices 
of sound which no one was likely to surpass ; 
Haydn and Mozart had discovered the wonderful 
possibilities of the orchestra, and had gone far

in realizing them. It was Beethoven who came, 
not only as the innovator, but also as the man 
who was to understand and to fulfil. Whatever 
form of music he touched, he enlarged and car- 
ried forward. The profound seriousness of his 
character appeared in his epoch-making produc- 
tions. With the chord of E-flat major, struck 
by the full orchestra, which opens the " Simf onia 
Eroica," the battle with the old was declared and 
the victory of the new was assured. Although 
Beethoven lived in close, association with the 
titled and the great, he was no courtier ; the self- 
educated hero recognized the value of his work, 
and had small reverence for temporalities that 
could but indifferently justify themselves before 
his imperious demand of use and service. They 
spent a whole anxious night with him once in the 
vain attempt to persuade him to make some 
changes in his " Fidelio." If music has now 
everywhere found a recognition as a deeply 
intentioned art, the result is largely due to this 
man who gave to it the whole of his life and 
effort. 

It was the great age of Germany in all ways 
except the political. The last feverish years of 
Xapoleon were disturbing Europe. The com- 
poser at first looked upon him as the represen- 
tative of the republican spirit ; but with the 
revelation of his true character Beethoven 
strongly expressed his disappointment and ab- 
horrence. In literature he had as contempo- 
raries and co-workers Schiller and Goethe ; in 
philosophy he found himself in association with 
Kant and Hegel ; the Oriental world was 
reopened and began to pour her hoarded trea- 
sures into the lap of Europe ; Lessing and the 
Schlegels had given criticism a genuine scientific 
character ; Homer and Shakespeare and Cal- 
deron and Dante were made accessible in trans- 
lations that have hardly been equalled since; 
history and science were making similar ad- 
vances. Beethoven's education had been of the 
most meagre kind, but, like Shakespeare, he 
made up for it by a remarkable capacity of 
intuitive understanding and a limitless power of 
absorption. The ideas of Europe were teeming 
in his brain, and the resources of his art found 
development in the storm and stress of expres- 
sion. He pondered his writings with immense 
care; he composed with extraordinary energy; 
he was an unsurpassed improvisator on the piano 
or organ ; but his pieces were elaborated with 
extreme caution, and long periods of time elapsed 
before he found them suitable for public accept- 
ance. The heroic, the normal, the transcen- 
dental, in life and thought, were his assured

dwelling-place ; and his music is the wittiest 
and the wisest yet given to the world. 

Beethoven had a tormented time in his daily 
living ; he was not well equipped to battle with 
the usual exigencies that confront a man in the 
practical sphere. His family was a care and 
trial to him ; he met with the usual indifference 
to his purposes, and a remarkable amount of in- 
gratitude ; he found himself unable to enter upon 
a settled and regular existence. He spent most 
of his life in Vienna, with a few journeys to 
other large cities of Germany. He had the 
recognition and admiration of the great- persons 
of his time. He was seen to be one of the excep- 
tional leaders. He had the gift of friendships, 
although these were not undisturbed by tem- 
pests. He has left an imperishable heritage, 
and the world has grown better because he has 
lived in it. 

The new edition of the letters of Beethoven 
in two sumptuous volumes is assuredly a final 
and authoritative one. Dr. A. C. Kalischer, of 
Berlin, the editor and compiler, makes the fol- 
lowing remarkable statement : 

" There are many new letters printed here for the first 
time, some of exceptional length; and they show the 
composer to us under new aspects. The edition is a crit- 
ical one. By that I mean that it was my chief aim to 
see that the text was pure. For that purpose it was 
necessary to consult as many original letters as possible, 
a task on which I have been engaged for a good twenty 
years. During the time I have examined over six hun- 
dred autograph letters, and compared them with printed 
editions, and then made corrections. Taking everything 
into account — style, grammar, orthography, and punct- 
uation — -I have the astounding declaration to make, 
viz., that of all the editors of Beethoven's letters, none 
has reproduced quite correctly any of the original letters 
which I have examined. Of all editors, likewise copy- 
ists of Beethoven letters, Anton Schindler and Otto 
Jahn were the most careful. In the preparation of a 
critical edition, the great collection of letters of Beetho- 
ven copied by Otto Jahn (now in the Royal Library of 
Berlin) is of immense advantage." 

There are presented in the Kalischer edition 
twelve hundred and twenty documents ; these 
are of course principally letters, authenticated 
to the uttermost, and accompanied by copious 
annotations and explanations, giving the present 
place and ownership of the letters, clearing up 
obscurities and allusions, and connecting them 
with the events in the author's career which gave 
them birth. The Royal Library of Berlin, the 
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and the Stadt- 
bibliothek of Vienna, the music firms of Breit- 
kopf and Haertel and Peters at Leipsic, and 
Schott and Sons at Mainz, and many private 
collectors, have rendered Dr. Kalischer liberal 
assistance. He is intimately acquainted with 



all sides of Beethoven's life and work, and is 
admirably equipped to expound the letters, 
which are often enigmatical and abound in pecu- 
liarities that call for elucidation. 

The letters are exceedingly varied and indi- 
vidual. Beethoven was in no sense a model 
letter-writter. The idea of the publication of his 
letters no more came into his head than it does 
into ours when we rapidly throw off a short effu- 
sion to one of our friends. He was not a literary 
man like Wagner, his successor. These letters 
are the immediate expression of his feelings and 
opinions at the time, and therefore as vital as so 
much conversation. The expression is often 
loose and sometimes obscure ; he had an idiom 
peculiar to himself. They are sufficiently frank 
and delightfully contradictory ; he can call a 
man a rascal in one outburst of feeling, and then 
be quite complimentary to him in another. He 
had a strange and humorous faculty of punning, 
some of these efforts verging on the impossible. 
The letters make a running commentary on their 
author's life ; and in reading them through in 
their present chronological arrangement, there 
rises up vividly before us the picture of the man 
and his environment, his arduous struggles, his 
impetuous determinations to free himself from 
every sort of bondage, his recognition of his 
place and worth. Yet the reserve of the man 
rarely allows him to reveal the deepest parts of 
his nature ; some of them belong to the love- 
episodes of his career, which terminated disas- 
trously, and some of them deal with his art. He 
had an artists admiration for his predecessors. 
He calls Bach " the forefather of harmony," 
and of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, he says : " Do 
not snatch the laurel wreaths from them ; they 
are entitled to them, as yet I am not." Still, 
he could say of " Don Juan " that the music was 
degraded by the scandalous subject. 

There are letters written to the famous people 
of the time, to Goethe, the Cardinal Archduke 
Rudolph, an intimate friend, to the Orientalist, 
Von Hammer-Purgstal, to the poet, Grillparzer, 
to Bettina von Arnim, to Sir George Smart in 
London, to Theodor Koerner. In one of the 
letters he makes this utterance on art : 

"Continue ; do not only practise art, but get at the heart 
of it; this it deserves, for only art and science raise 
man to the God-head. The true artist is not proud, he 
unfortunately sees that art has no limits; he feels darkly 
how far he is from the goal; and though he may be 
admired by others, he is sad not to have reached that 
point to which his better genius only appears as a dis- 
tant, guiding sun. I would, perhaps, rather come to 
you and your people, than to many rich folk, who dis- 
play inward poverty. If one day I should come to H., 
I will come to you, to your house; I know no other

excellences in man than those which cause him to rank 
among better men; where I find this, there is my home." 

Here is a piecfe of musical criticism : 

" I heartily rejoice in the same opinion which you 
share with me in regard to the terms indicating time- 
measure, which have been handed down to us from the 
barbarous period of music. For, only to name one 
thing, what can be more senseless than allegro, which, 
once for all, means merry, and how far-off are we fre- 
quently from such conception of this time-measure, in 
that the music itself expresses something quite contrary 
to the term. So far as the four principal movements 
are concerned, but which are far from having the im- 
portance of the four winds, we consider them last. It 
is another matter with words indicating the character 
of a piece; these we can not give up, as time refers 
rather to the body, whereas these are already themselves 
related to the soul of the piece." 

Of his deafness, which came upon him so 
early and which left to him only an inner 
hearing of his compositions, he writes : 

" O ye men who regard me or declare me to be malig- 
nant, stubborn or cynical, how unjust are ye towards 
me ! You do not know the secret cause of my seeming 
so. From childhood onward, my heart and mind 
prompted me to be kind and tender, and I was ever 
iuclined to accomplish great deeds. But only think that 
during the last six years, I have been in a wretched 
condition, rendered worse by unintelligent physicians. 
Deceived from year to year with hopes of improvement, 
and then finally forced to the prospect of lasting infirmity 
(which may last for years, or even be totally incurable), 
born with a fiery, active temperament, even susceptive 
of the diversities of society, 1 had soon to retire from 
the world, to live a solitary life. At times, even, I 
endeavored to forget all this; but how harshly was I 
driven back by the redoubled experience of my bad 
hearing. Yet it was not possible for me to say to men: 
Speak louder, shout, for I am deaf. Alas ! how could 
I declare the weakness of a sense which in me ought to 
be more acute than in others — a sense which formerly 
I possessed in highest perfection, a perfection which few 
in my profession enjoy, or ever have enjoyed; no, I can- 
not do it. Forgive, therefore, if you see me withdraw, 
when 1 would willingly mix with you." 

For students of Beethoven, this edition of the 
letters is now the only one. Dr. Kalischer calls 
it a complete edition — meaning, as he explains, 
that he has given all the letters contained in 
other editions, together with many additional 
ones now printed for the first time. His anno- 
tations and commentary give his work the char- 
acter of a biography, and it is brought up to 
date. These volumes belong in the same cate- 
gory with those of Thayer, the American author 
of the monumental account of Beethoven's life. 
The translation, made by Mr. J. S. Shedlock, 
is very well done ; it reproduces the idiom of 
the original, the irregularities of the style, its 
vehemence and humor, even the astonishing puns 
as far as anyone can. The translator also fur- 
nishes a valuable Introduction. There are two 



good indexes. Many portraits of the composer 
at different periods of his life are inserted, and 
facsimiles of the manuscripts of his famous works 
are given, as also of the letters. The publishers 
have done their part well; the volumes are 
superb specimens of print and binding. In fact, 
with Thayer, with Marx, and with the present 
publication, one will have a good apparatus for 
the study of the unique and illustrious musician's 
life and achievements.

Social, axd Bi rgnrase Life of 
Anxtext Rome.* 

The writer of a book on the social life of 
the past is exposed to a thorough testing of his 
ability and character. In the first place, it is 
desperately difficult to acquire a satisfactory 
knowledge of the social life of any period, so 
there arises the temptation to substitute the 
probable for the reliable. And even when this 
fundamental difficulty has been painfully over- 
come, there remains the enticement to command 
attention by painting the social picture strik- 
ingly like our own day, or in striking contrast 
thereto, or at any rate strikingly something. 
It is hard to paint in calm and serene accuracy, 
when the public eye can be caught and held 
by a deviation of the brush so slight as to seem 
almost pardonable. For example, in dealing 
with slavery, we have seen in our own age what 
a tremendous effect a writer may produce by 
dwelling upon the more emotional phases of the 
subject. Nor is it at all unfair to set forth the ter- 
rible physical sufferings and mental anguish of 
the slave ; it is only a question of emphasis. Yet 
in an historical treatise it is not the part of san- 
ity to give twenty pages to the horrors of the 
dungeon or the flogging-post, and a single 
paragraph to the economic aspects of slavery ; 
although the average reader, and even the 
average author, is prone to find more interest 
in the less balanced treatment. Similarly, 
in the matter of food and drink the much 
quoted impossible table dainties of an Apicius 
are far more alluring than the humble grain 
and garden-truck on which Gaivs and Gaia, or 
roughly the whole Italian nation, regularly 
subsisted. It will take many volumes of sane 
scholarship, and many years must be spent in 
popularizing results, before the general concep-

tion of Roman life shall be cleared of absurd- 
ities and brought to anything like accuracy. 
For this reason one will welcome every publi- 
cation on this topic that is marked by sound 
knowledge, by clarity of presentation, and by 
freedom from extravagance. 

Of late, Roman history has felt the effects of 
the general tendency to emphasize the economic 
and sociological sides of historical study ; and our 
libraries have been enriched by some excellent 
studies of life under the Empire. But the first 
century b. c, prior to the accession of Augustus, 
has been comparatively slighted, despite the 
existence of such a stimulating and delightful 
introduction as Boissier's Cicero et ses amis. 
Some explanation of this may be found in the 
obvious importance of the political history, 
which has proved so engrossing as to bring about 
the neglect of the social side where it did not 
bear very directly on the public life. Toward 
the remedying of this neglect Professor Fowler 
has contributed an important volume, wherein 
he essays to tell quce vita, qui mores fuerint in 
the days of the great orator. 

A treatise of this nature falls into rather 
natural divisions, and in our volume we find 
eleven chapters with such captions as " The 
Lower Population," "The Daily Life of the 
Well-to-do," "The Slave Population," and 
"Religion." Of these divisions, the third, 
which treats of " The Men of Business and their 
Methods," will probably seem the freshest to 
most readers. The first three decades of the 
second century b. c. witnessed a tremendous in- 
pouring of wealth into the city on the Tiber. 
The war indemnities of Carthage and other 
conquered states, the booty from the victorious 
compaigns, the produce of the Spanish mines, 
and other sources of wealth, must have con- 
tributed millions upon millions of money. In 
167 b. c. the Roman citizen was freed from the 
property tax. And the governmental prosperity 
was reflected in the capitalistic possibilities. 
The age of speculation and colossal fortunes was 
at hand. In a few decades there was found a 
Crassus with about a million dollars invested in 
land alone, although that was only a tiny part 
of his possessions ; and Plutarch has left a sin- 
gularly interesting account of one source of this 
magnate's wealth : 

"Observing [in Sulla's time] the accidents that were 
familiar at Rome, conflagrations and tumbling down of 
houses owing to their weight and crowded state, he 
bought slaves who were architects and builders. Hav- 
ing collected these to the number of more than five hun- 
dred, it was his practice to buy up houses on fire, and 
houses next to those on fire: for the owners, frightened 



and anxious, would sell them cheap. And thus the 
greater part of Rome fell into the hands of Crassus." 

Most fortunes, however, were amassed by means 
much less picturesque. Ordinary business had 
grown to an enormous scale ; and the shrewd 
man had abundant opportunity. Food for hun- 
dreds of thousands of mouths had to be brought 
to Rome and .distributed ; marine traffic proved 
extremely lucrative when the risks were reduced 
by a rough system of mutual insurance ; taxes 
had to be collected, and, like other public busi- 
ness, the collecting was done by contract ; all the 
activities of banking were open. In short, there 
were all the necessities and opportunities of a 
huge city that was the opulent mistress of the 
world about the Mediterranean. 

The facilities for credit and for the transfer- 
ence of money are decidedly surprising to the 
reader whose knowledge of financial matters is 
practical rather than historical. The Roman 
argentarius would not only pay money on a 
written order, but would issue a letter of credit 
valid in distant cities. The example always 
referred to is the banker who provided for 
Cicero's son, when he went to spend his student 
days at the University of Athens. In the 
matter of debt the standing instance is Julius 
Caesar, who seems to have amassed a debt of 
nearly a million and a half dollars while he was 
still a youth. Nor may this be attributed solely 
to the genius of this famous borrower ; for there 
were bankers who were lending on a large scale, 
and any " respectable " citizen could borrow 
freely without the least trouble. Sometimes, 
indeed, lending became a mere gamble, as may 
be most easily seen in an extreme case. Rabi- 
rius was a financier of the " high " type, dealing 
in the stock of the large tax-farming companies 
and lending money to municipalities as well as 
to individuals. Among his debtors was Ptolemy 
Auletes, King of Egypt, who was driven from 
his throne. But Rabirius was willing to gamble 
on his restoration ; and not only continued to 
make loans himself, but also to recommend the 
venture to other financiers. Eventually, polit- 
ical pressure was called into play, with the result 
that the royal debtor was placed once more in 
control of the Egyptian treasury. But straight- 
way he turned upon his hapless creditor, who 
was fortunate to escape to Italy with his life. 
Even the most advanced form of " insurance " 
against the result of elections can hardly par- 
allel this remarkable instance. 

Herewith we have stumbled upon the inter- 
ference of the capitalist in government ; and this 
became a persistent menace, particularly in the 



1909.]

administration of the provinces. At the worst, 
the abuses were simply terrible. At the best, 
the large question of the financial dependence on 
the provinces was a matter of deep concern : and 
we may quote the words spoken by Cicero when 
he was pleading for an effective campaign 
against Mithridates in Asia. 

" And believe me (though you know it well enough) 
that the whole system of credit and finance which is 
carried on here at Rome in the Forum, is inextricably 
bound up with the revenues of the Asiatic province. 
If those revenues are destroyed, our whole system of 
credit will come down with a crash." 
We may not carry the thought further ; but 
here the orator has voiced a large part of the 
explanation of the two centuries of occidental 
history. Fortunately, Rome managed to grope 
along until the strong rule of the early Empire 
brought some sort of solution. 

Of the remaining chapters of Professor 
Fowler's interesting book we may notice only 
one, and that with the utmost brevity ; but it is 
worth pointing out that " Marriage and the 
Roman Lady " may be accepted as a concise and 
clear statement of a question not seldom mis- 
understood . Our author knows that there were 
Clodias and other large-eyed ladies at Rome ; 
that passionate love and serious marriage were 
distinctly dissevered ; that most men and a grow- 
ing number of women felt no final obligation 
toward conjugal fidelity in the strictest sense. 
But he understands withal that the family tie 
was still a reality to many, and that the histo- 
rian's folly of believing in universal virtue is 
only less absurd than the folly of believing in 
universal vice. The race that still cherished the 
tales of Lucre tia and Virginia could not be alto- 
gether void of ideals of chastity and fidelity. 
And whenever the student of this period begins 
to breathe hard in the fetid atmosphere of a part 
of our evidence, he will turn with glad relief to 
a husband's tribute left us by a Roman of the 
day, whose name was probably Q. Lucretius 
Vespillo. When his wife died he recorded her 
story and his own touching grief on marble ; and 
the centuries have kindly preserved a large part 
6f it for our instruction. On the narrative of 
her thrilling adventures and perils, we may not 
tarry, although it makes some fiction seem dull. 
But we must quote the husband's account of her 
daily life and homely virtues as given in Professor 
Fowler's paraphrase. 

" You were a faithful wife to me, and an obedient 
one : you were kind and gracious, sociable and friendly : 
you were assiduous at your spinning (lanijicia) : you 
followed the religious rites of your family and state, and 
admitted no foreign cults or degraded magic (super- 
stitio) : you did not dress conspicuously, nor seek to 



make a display in your household arrangements. Your 
duty to our whole household was exemplary: you 
tended my mother as carefully as if she had been your 
own. You had innumerable other excellences, in com- 
mon with all other worthy matrons, but these I have 
mentioned were peculiarly yours." 

This portrait of a rare and precious woman may 
stand to challenge any hasty general condemna- 
tion of the marital life of a people so well worth 
understanding. 

The other sections of the book must be passed 
over ; but they are all carefully written, and to 
many will prove more interesting than the two 
we have mentioned above. For the general 
reader the treatment is adequate throughout ; 
and to the student the volume may be recom- 
mended just as cordially, with the suggestion 
that he will often find in it a starting-point 
rather than a resting-place. It is the sort of 
book we are glad to welcome in accordance with 
our opening paragraph. F> B> R< Hellems. 



<* IX>, HERE A WELL-MEAXDfG BOOK ! " 

In his interesting introductory essay to the 
new reprint of Florio's Montaigne, Mr. Thomas 
Seccombe speaks as a lover of Montaigne, but 
not as an idolater. "Montaigne," he says, 
" reminds us of the solitary Robinson on his 
island, meditating always upon the same theme 
of the singular adventures and melancholy fate 
of man. To show us how whimsical a creature 
man is, how infinite in his variety and insatiable 
in his desires, he takes himself and exhibits the 
creature to us. He lives before us. He tells 
us what an indecent old fellow lurked behind 
the fur and velvet of his ceremonial manner. 
He tells us how gluttonously he ate, how he 
crossed himself when he yawned, said ' God be 
wi' ye ! ' when he sneezed, and how fond he was 
of scratching." The world had always had its 
frank speakers, but never, until Montaigne, a 
speaker whose frankness, untouched by com- 
punction, dealt zestfully with his own foibles. 
"To 'pour oneself out like Old Montaigne,'" 
says Mr. Seccombe, " has become, consciously 
or unconsciously, the ideal of every personal 
writer from La Bruydre and Pascal onwards. 
He has indeed cast his pollen over La Bruyere, 
Montesquieu, Rousseau, Sterne, Charles Lamb, 
Thoreau, and Emerson." This is a passable 
generalization ; but not one of these writers,

after all, has the bland ingenuousness of the 
Lord of Montaigne. There is a radical differ- 
ence between the man who prattles about him- 
self for love of the theme, and the man who 
announces, " I am about to commit an amiable 
indiscretion : listen and you shall hear what a 
sad dog I really am." The one writer who 
resembled Montaigne in his manner of self- 
revelation was Mr. Secretary Pepys, who had 
probably never read a line of the Essays, and 
had no notion of writing for any eye but his own. 
Mr. Seccombe's sketch of Montaigne's life 
and genius is admirable for the most part, being 
disfigured only by an occasional ebullience of 
style, and by one or two momentary debauches 
of metaphor, such as, " He finds the living nerve 
in the old flint classics, which are to him no mere 
dried specimens of literary form, but human 
documents palpitating with life." A passage 
more fairly representing him would be, " Mon- 
taigne possesses every quality appropriate to a 
great prose- writer with one single exception, the 
poetic quality and its accompanying gift of 
ideality." We do not understand Mr. Seccombe 
to be the editor of the present text, which is a 
reprint of the third edition of Florio (1632), but 
he is frankly a Florio partisan. " Florio's 
Montaigne," he declares, " still ranks as the 
great outstanding and standard English render- 
ing . . . the regnant Montaigne, the most pop- 
ular rendering in the market on both sides of 
the Atlantic." Whatever may be true of its 
market value, the supremacy of Florio is hardly 
an acknowledged fact on other grounds. His 
Elizabethan English is often, with all its elab- 
oration, brilliantly faithful to the meaning of 
the original. But in a multitude of instances it 
expresses anything but that meaning. He was 
at all events the pioneer ; and the edition of 
1603 had a further sentimental interest. Its 
effect upon Elizabethan literature was instant 
and powerful. Bacon quoted it ; Ben Jonson 
had a copy ; and whether the Shakespeare auto- 
graph in the British Museum is genuine or not, 
the subsequent plays are full of reminiscences of 
the Essays. However, it is not the version 
Shakespeare knew which is now put before us in 
modern dress, but a later edition, much revised 
yet still far from perfect. Some half century 
later, Cotton puts forth his translation, with the 
admission that although he is confident he under- 
stands French " as well as any man," he has 
" sometimes been forced to grope at " his author's 
meaning. Sometimes he left out passages which 
were too much for him ; his interpolations are far 
fewer than Florio's. Both Florio and Cotton 



are, says Mr. Seccombe, very inaccurate : " No 
successor, however, has arisen, and we must 
make the best we can of them." This seems to 
put them in the same class, as to be taken or 
left in their original form. But in fact a num- 
ber of attempts have been made, with fair 
measure of success, to approximate a perfect 
version by the emendation of Cotton, — as it 
stands, certainly not less a masterpiece than 
Florio. Toward such a version the revisions of 
the Hazlitts made a good deal of progress. Apart 
from the question of accuracy, there is no ver- 
sion of Montaigne so delightful to read as that 
of the elder Hazlitt. W. Carew Hazlitt has, 
by repeated revision, produced a text no doubt 
greatly more accurate, but also far less spirited 
and idiomatic. 

However, it is certainly true that Florio has 
a place of his own which is far more independent 
of revision than that of Cotton. He is, if noth- 
ing else, an Elizabethan classic ; and he is best 
reprinted, as in the present instance, word by

Philosophy of the Spiritual Life.* 



Two books by Professor Eucken, of the Uni- 
versity of Jena, presented to American readers 
in an English translation with the titles " The 
Life of the Spirit " and " The Problem of 
Human Life," deserve attention both by reason 
of their intrinsic merit, and from the fact that 
the author has just received the Nobel Prize for 
having written them. The first of these books, 
" The Life of the Spirit," is simple in construc- 
tion and well sustained in manner of presen- 
tation. The author regards a spiritual life a 
life of insights and affections, as the normal 
development of man, and affirms that this life 
must be sustained by a philosophy suited to it. 
The life gives occasion to the philosophy, and

the philosophy justifies and guides the life. 
This life springs from the lower life of the 
senses, and carries it forward, in a form true 
to both, to its final attainments. The spiritual 
life is a thoughtful, progressive, tentative one, 
and has room enough, motive enough, and light 
enough, for endless expansion. But this expan- 
sion must be supported by a rational appre- 
hension of its grounds ; and this apprehension is 
philosophy. The philosophy grows with the life 
which it expounds and by which it is expounded. 
Such a life is in the highest degree progressive, 
and binds together at once the reflective and 
the empirical world. Hence experience, in its 
individual and collective form, in its sensuous 
and its thoughtful possession of the world, in its 
outward spread and upward stretch, in its hold 
on earth and air by root, by stem, by tendril 
and by bud, is of such variety and scope as to 
give to the life of the spirit an endless develop- 
ment, and a constantly enlarged mastery of the 
substance and form and direction of its powers. 
An ever changeable and ministering philosophy 
goes with this development, shares its enlarged 
vision, and is close at hand to lend support to 
the vision of the spirit and impart to it form 
and foundation in its daily contact with human 
experience. 

The first postulate, therefore, of spiritual 
growth is spiritual powers : and the second pos- 
tulate is an intellectual activity which carries 
light, with increasing disclosure, along the path 
of progress. Philosophy is no mathematical for- 
mula, good for certain processes and to be em- 
ployed in one way only ; is no semi-mechanical 
junction of ideas, having at all times the same 
operation in the world of thought, and a like 
adaptation to all minds, but is a variable vision 
of each spirit as it pursues its own way, — an 
adumbration of truth, a sequence of convictions 
which subserve the immediate purposes of life 
and bear it forward as a real unfolding of power 
for higher purposes. Philosophy is, like the 
vital principle, an indispensable presence every 
moment, but variable in manifestation as each 
new point is reached in the unfolding. 

How can such a philosophy justify itself each 
instant to the mind that entertains it ? and how 
can it hold its own in the presence of other 
thinkers ? The validity of such a philosophy is 
the vindication of our higher life. If there is 
such a life, it must have its basis in such a phil- 
osophy, involved or formulated. From the earn- 
est history of the human mind there has been 
a persistent expenditure of thought in framing 
such a philosophy and in urging it upon other 



minds ; and also an equally persistent effort by 
other minds in crowding it out, although the 
contempt they have brought to the effort has 
itself been only another phase of the same eter- 
nal explanatory process. Man's life is much 
broader, much deeper, with much wider rela- 
tions, than men are prepared as yet to accept. 
AVe move but slowly toward the grand recon- 
ciliations of the world. The sensuous elements 
are more obvious, more immediate and universal, 
than the spiritual elements ; as the soil is more 
obtrusive and constant than are the plants that 
spring from it. Yet the spiritual life, the life 
that transcends the sensuous life, is constantly 
coming to birth and rising above it ;' as the 
vegetable life, hardy or tender, plain or beau- 
tiful, common or rare, is all thrust up out of the 
soil as the one great storehouse of mystery. Men 
have a fondness for the mechanical, and a sense 
of knowledge and mastery in connection with it 
which often serves to veil the higher possessions 
and problems of life. Take such a doctrine as 
Evolution, so central in human thought : men 
have often made a limitation and obstacle out of 
it, rendering it in too rigid and narrow a fashion. 
It has become a deadlock of physical depend- 
ences, leaving no room for spiritual powers. 
Not till the spiritual life is found immanent 
in the physical process does the world become 
alive again, and Evolution, pressing through all 
inferior forms, comes to its true measurement in 
spiritual expression. 

A changeable philosophy not only momen- 
tarily justifies itself to the mind that entertains 
it, but makes an ever-renewed appeal to the 
intellectual world at large. We come to see 
that philosophy constantly errs by pushing some 
clues too far, and by neglecting others. It has 
not reconciled the elements of life, but has 
developed them separately and in antagonism 
to each other. It has found some single ray of 
light, planted itself in it, pursued it in its obscure 
development, and so mistaken it for a full 
illumination. 

This fundamental conception is enforced in 
" The Life of the Spirit " in its leading direc- 
tions — unity and multiplicity, change and per- 
sistence, the outer and the inner world, truth 
and happiness. The solution in each discussion 
is found to emphasize this dependence of a 
spiritual life on the growing apprehension of 
the dependence of the two worlds, physical and 
spiritual, on each other. The style of the book 
is somewhat diffuse, but it leads us by a sure 
path to this fundamental notion of an expand- 
ing life which is mothering the world and bring-

ing to it a truer and more adequate philosophy. 
These discussions are sometimes obscure in 
phraseology, and we are compelled to overpower 
the immediate expression by the ruling idea. 
In this respect, the second chapter, " Change 
and Persistence," is least satisfactory. But 
however we may trip here and there, the path 
becomes more and more a highway before us — 
the very highway in which the human family is 
travelling. John Bascom. 



Briefs on New Books. 



It is doubtful if there is another 
The curious th ■ English literature who has 

life of Sterne. & . . 

more of himseli in his works or more 
of his works in himself than Laurence Sterne. To 
go from his books to his life is like going from one 
volume to another in a continuous narrative. We 
cannot pretend to know either the man or his work 
without studying both. All that distinguishes the 
books marks the man or his associates. And this 
curious life we have now an excellent opportunity to 
know, as we have not known it hitherto, in Professor 
Cross's " Life and Times of Laurence Sterne " (Mac- 
millan). It is an extremely interesting narrative, as 
Sterne moves from the obscurity of a York parish 
to the full blaze of London society, so that he is as 
well known as the prime minister, and has a letter 
delivered to him with only the address "Tristram 
Shandy, Europe." And his friends are such remark- 
able persons, — that assembly of Demoniacs, espe- 
cially, of whom Hall Stevenson, his best friend, was 
the leader. This club was an unholy congregation 
of Devil-worshippers for fun. Wilkes, the politician, 
virtually broke up the concern, when, during the 
invocation of his Satanic majesty, he let loose a 
baboon decked in the conventionial insignia of the 
Devil, and produced indescribable consternation 
among the revellers. Sterne's many love affairs, 
from his affection for Miss Lumley, which was 
blighted by their marriage, to the soul-consuming 
passion of the dying old man for Mrs. Draper, both 
married, — all these are much like the affairs of the 
heart that we find in the pages of "Tristram Shandy " 
or " The Sentimental Journey." They were very 
likely judged correctly by Coleridge, who said that 
Sterne resembled a child who just touches a hot tea- 
pot with trembling fingers because it has been for- 
bidden him. Professor Cross keeps from the unjust 
acerbity of Thackeray in treating of these delicate 
matters, and yet does not gloze them over as not 
calling for reprobation. It is Sterne's surpassing 
humor that saves the books, and his " queerness " 
that puts him out of the roll of common men and 
keeps us from looking too closely at the deed. The 
relation of the author to his literary sources is well 
brought out, and yet the prime fact is never lost sight 
of that the residuum which gives distinction to the 



work is, after all, Sterne's supreme comic power. 
Professor Cross's final judgment, that he was " a 
humourist pure and simple, and nothing else," indi- 
cates his weakness as well as his strength. 

Even so scholastic a title as " A 
Inv^TZ^. Pluralistic Universe "(Longmans) 

will not weaken the impulse that 
goes out to welcome any pages written by Professor 
William James. The volume forms the Hibbert 
Lectures given at Manchester College, Oxford, last 
year, and requires for the patient and technical 
comprehension the devotion to philosophic subtlety 
that the Oxford tradition supports. Yet the manner 
is thoroughly American, and must have seemed most 
unconventional to the older academic usage. The 
central concern of the philosophy, that moves swiftly, 
even jauntily, 'twixt heaven and earth, is the framing 
of some concept that will impart rationality to the 
cosmic creation and satisfaction to the human specta- 
tor and sharer of the worldly destiny. More speci- 
fically, it becomes a protracted contest between the 
demands of the absolute and the adequacy of the vital 
illumination of experience ; and yet, more concretely, 
it becomes a direct competition between the sover- 
eignty of the logic-bound intellect and the demands 
of the eager emotions. Professor James finds no 
help and much confusion in the absolute, and finds 
the very essence of all that is significant and vital 
in the changing stream of experience. His most 
serious skepticism is of the commanding claim of 
the reason in its opposition to the will to believe ; 
and his arraignment of the vices of the philosophers 
is just this abuse of intellectualism, which renders 
them unresponsive to the real meaning of experience, 
whose formal outline, like men of straw, they find 
inadequate to their rational and ethical needs. Into 
this type of philosophical nicety, as into matters of 
artistic technique, only the professional will care or 
dare to follow ; and the discerning and interested 
amateur, as he follows the conversation or the ex- 
hibition with appreciation and respect, is peculiarly 
grateful for the illuminating and refreshing personal 
touches of the expositor. The hearers of Professor 
James doubtless had this advantage to a greater extent 
than his readers ; but the latter will be repaid for the 
effort to secure an intelligent insight into the Jamesian 

point of view. 

The biographies In a volume entitled « The Sisters of

of Napoleon. Trowbridge presents what is sub- 
stantially a translation from the French of Joseph 
Turquan. These bits of intimate and rather gossipy 
history are more common in France than they are 
on this side of the water, but they find eager readers 
everywhere. Mr. Trowbridge's earlier books — 
" Mirabeau the Demi-God " and " Court Beauties of 
Old Whitehall" — have been well received, and the 
present volume ought to maintain his reputation, for 
he has made a readable and in general an adequate 
version of a shrewdly-chosen original. One cannot

remarking that slips like u demanding of Napoleon

'• the more they became engulfed in the movement 
and noise of Paris, he appeared to regret having 
almost suffered himself to be influenced by senti- 
ment" (p. 91), are unnecessary even in a transla- 
tion. Inaccuracies, such as the transformation of 
on pretendait into " one pretended," are by no 
means infrequent. It must be said in praise of the 
English version, whatever may have been true of the 
French original, that the lives of three very disrep- 
utable women are told with good taste, without 
either prudery or coarseness. The three biographies 
are separate. The masculine Elisa, Grand Dnchess 
of Tuscany, and the miserable intriguer Caroline, 
Queen of Naples, are. as might be expected, dis- 
missed somewhat more summarily than Pauline, the 
irresistibly charming and sporadically warm-hearted 
if unprincipled Princess of Guastalla, who was the 
only sister to remain faithful to her great brother to 
the end. Both author and translator are enthusiastic 
partisans of Napoleon, and unsparing critics of 
Josephine, Madame Mere, and the others.

with journalistic snappiness. We are tempted to 
quote, in illustration, from the opening chapter, which 
is entitled M The Home of Burlesque." Describing 
the rise of the drop-curtain and the beginning of the 
varied entertainment, the author writes : " Fortu- 
nately, the overture soon spends its virulence, and 
up soars the Roman hippodrome, discovering the 
deck of a battleship, whereupon the '40 la belle 
Parisiennes 40' — grievously decimated, since they 
number scarce more than twelve, yet effulgent in 
silks and jewels and blinding blonde tresses — are

court ladies, dancing . . . and screeching a senti- 
mental ditty now serving its novitiate ere gracing the

— to endure full sixty minutes." The misuse of 
■ decimate " hardly calls for serious censure in com- 
position that strains for lively picturesqueness rather 
than for correctness ; yet the book might have been 
written effectively and at the same time with a little 
less of appeal to a low standard of literary taste. 
The chapters deal with popular amusement resorts, 
society u in Nellie Grogan's world," the muses in 
" East Gissing Street," and our national game. The 
numerous pen-and-ink sketches by the author admir- 
ably illustrate his text. 



Pretent, pott. Notwithstanding so many books have 
and future been written about Japan, Mr. H. B. 

of Japan. Montgomery thinks there is room for 

one more. Accordingly he offers us u The Empire 
of the East, a Simple Account of Japan as it was, is, 
and will be " (McClurg). Every writer on the Real 
Japan, Things Japanese, and Japan from the Inside, 
thinks himself possessed of facts and opinions that 
will at last make the non-Japanese world understand 
that marvellous and perplexing empire of the New 
Far West. Mr. Montgomery is no exception to the 
rule, and the addition of his book to the lengthening 
list is but another testimony to the richness and in- 
terest of the theme. He writes simply and briefly 
of such topics as he has selected out of so large a sub- 
ject, and offers with strong conviction his personal 
opinion on various debatable questions. Confessing 
himself an ardent admirer of Japan, he naturally pre- 
sents her in her best aspect and predicts a prosperous 
future for her enterprising people. In the modern 
development of Japanese literature, he thinks the 
present attempt to substitute our alphabet for the 
Chinese characters will not prove either successful or 
desirable. His brief historical sketch of the country 
omits all mention of Commodore Perry and his part 
in opening Japan to the western world — in occidental 
eyes the supremely important event of the country's 
later history. The Swedish traveller and savant 
Thunberg is referred to as writing on Japan and as 
•• relating his impressions in the seventeenth cen- 
tury," whereas he was not born until 1743. But this 
is a momentary inadvertence ; elsewhere the author 
appears to assign him to his proper period. Consid- 
erable attention is paid to Japanese art in the book, 
and the reproductions of native paintings are pleas- 
ing and representative. On the whole, the author has 
done well to give us one more book about Japan.

ancestry and conditions, is afforded by the volume 
of Professor Kirkpatrick on u Genetic Psychology," 
which he further specifies as "An Introduction to 
an Objective and Genetic View of Intelligence " 
(Macmillan). The plan underlying the work is an 
excellent one — that of coining in one exposition the 
underlying types of behavior of our own complex 
mentality and the antecedent and simpler varieties 
characteristic of the structurally simpler organisms. 
There thus results a conception of behavior as a con- 
sistent and expanding procedure, and of the mental 
factor in it as again an organic principle in a still 
larger whole. Nor is this left vague and generic ; 
it is coordinated with the amoeba and the insect and 
the fish and fowl ; it binds dog and ape with these, 
and these with man. All this makes for a certain 
realism in considering the affairs of our mental 
household that is helpful ; it prevents romancing in 
the field of immature speculation : and it discourages 
mere impressionism, which is hardly compatible with 
the careful analysis that alone yields the useful type

of fact. Yet withal it does not subordinate fact to

interests of the principles which are the chief concern 
alike of the man of affairs and of the student. The 
volume before us is a serviceable approach to this 
desirable end. 

A German tribute Ex-President Eliot is not, like the tra- 
ZZarZT an diurnal prop h e t, without honor in his 
citizen. own country ; and he is also highly 

honored outside his native land. His recent decora- 
tion by the Emperor of Japan was a striking proof 
that his influence extends even to the antipodes. 
Another tribute of respect reaches him at this memo- 
rable period of his life in the form of a brief biog- 
raphy, with appreciative comments on his services 
to education and the higher life, from the pen of 
Dr. Eugen Kuehneman, professor of philosophy at 
Breslau University, and twice within the last three 
years interchange professor at Harvard. " Charles 
W. Eliot, President of Harvard University (May 19, 
1869-May 19, 1909)" is a thin octavo (Houghton) 
with frontispiece portrait of its subject, and done 
into English by the author's friend, Dr. A. W. 
Boesche, instructor in German at Harvard. The 
original appears in the May and June numbers of 
the Deutsche Rundschau. The interest of the pro- 
duction, to us who are already familiar with Dr. 
Eliot's life-history and work and ideals, lies in its 
revelation of a cordial and intelligent appreciation 
of American educational methods as illustrated by 
the forty years of Harvard's development under its 
late chief executive. Incidental comparisons and 
contrasts with German methods and ideals impart 
additional interest to the author's chapters. The 
book is an important memorial of the Eliot regime. 



Typical old The passing of the genuine Yan- 
worthies of kee, — shrewd, witty, resourceful, 

New Bedford. mU ch adicted to swapping horses and 
stories, and finding in a jack-knife and a pine stick 
a never-failing solace and innocent distraction, — is 
to be regretted by lovers of the idiosyncratic in 
human character. The gathering together of the 
racy anecdotes and fading memories of typical old 
New Bedford worthies (and unworthies) in a volume 
entitled " In Whaling Days " (Little, Brown & Co.) 
is to be credited to an unknown editorial hand acting 
in behalf of the late Howland Tripp, whose literary 
aspirations and activities are briefly noticed in an 
introductory chapter. Mr. Tripp appears to have 
been a diligent student of human nature in its hum- 
bler types, and to have recovered from that insatiate 
past which is ever devouring the present a multi- 
tude of personal anecdotes and character-sketches 
that are well calculated to amuse the lover of homely 
New England stories. His chapters have such 
alluring headings as these : "A Town Meeting 
Episode," " Peanut Jim," " A Skim-milk Incident," 
" The First Tale of Phineas Foodie," " How Jerry 
Went to Boston," and " A Grandfather's Advice." 
The whaling element denoted by the title is all but 



lacking in the book, but the word serves well enough 
to indicate the time of the occurrences it chronicles. 
A few of the author's poems, on simple themes but 
of excellent workmanship, conclude this posthumous 
edition of his writings. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Harper & Brothers publish a new edition of 
Motley's " History of the United Netherlands," four 
volumes in two at a very moderate price. The present

Mr. Wallis J. Travis, is published by Messrs. Harper

numerous and instructive. 

Dr. Samuel McComb, Associate Director of the 
Emmanuel Church, issues \mder the title " The Power 
of Self-Suggestion " (Moffat, Yard & Co.) a small vol- 
ume containing an address, which reviews in the spirit 
of the movement connected with that church the varie- 
ties of aid to be derived from a vigorous and confident 
appeal to the best within one. 

" London's Lure," compiled by Miss Helen and Mr. 
Lewis Melville, is an anthology of brief passages in 
prose and verse, classified with more than ordinary 
intelligence, relating to the great city, its sights and 
scenes, its denizens, and its natural beauties. A great 
number of authors have been drawn upon for this 
attractive little book, which is published by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

" The New International Year Book " for 1908 is 
published uniform with " The New International Ency- 
clopaedia " by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., and is edited 
by Messrs. Frank Moore Colby and Allen Leon Churchill. 
This is the second annual issue of this series, which fol- 
lowed the older series after a gap of five years. We 
hope that support will not be lacking for the enterprise 
now resumed. It is so valuable for general reference 
that we can hardly believe that it will not command the 
sale necessary for its continued publication. The whole 
work is admirably done. Mr. Colby's name alone is a 
guaranty of thoroughness and accuracy, while the list 
of his associated contributors is of a nature to command 
the respect of those who know. 

Miss Mary E. Burt has done much useful work in the 
popularization of good literature for children's reading, 
and not the least of her services is represented by the 
two volumes she has recently prepared for Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co. One of the volumes is "Kipling 
Stories and Poems Every Child Should Know." Miss 
Burt's preface tartly says : " Here are some of the Strong 
Hearts who, a hundred years hence, will be studied in 
colleges, instead of that fetich, « The Princess,' and in 
lower schools, instead of those other fetiches, diacritical 
marks, and the made-up 'reading-matter' of commercial 
• educational houses ' ; for it is the dull product of unlit- 
erary minds which ' feminizes our schools,' and not the 
woman teacher." Without admitting all this, we will 
agree that Kipling makes good reading for boys and 
girls of every age. The other volume is " Adventures 
Every Child Should Know," and is based upon Carlo 
Lorenzini's " Pinocchio," — a fantastical story-book for 
children that has been vastly popular in Italy.

its way into a few thousand more nurseries. Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co. are the publishers. 

" Writings on American History," the bibliography 
begun in 1906, is continued for 1907 under the general

The death of Sarah Orne Jewett, on the twenty-fourth 
of June, took from us one of the most conscientious of 
our story-writers. Miss Jewett was deeply rooted in the 
life of New England, and has pictured many of its 
phases with deep fidelity and nnfailing charm. Born in 
September, 1849, she had nearly completed her sixtieth 
year. Her first book, " Deephaven," was published in 
1877, since which time she has been, except for very 
recent years, engaged in continuous literary work. 
Among her best known books we may mention " A 
Country Doctor," " A Marsh Island, " A White Heron, 
and Other Stories," " The Country of the Pointed Firs," 
and " The Tory Lover." She wrote a great many short 
stories for old and young, besides sketches of New 
England life and landscape, and the volume on the 
Normans in the " Story of the Nations " series. She 
was made a Doctor of Letters by Bowdoin College, a 
graceful and deserved tribute from the ancient seat of 
learning in her native state of Maine.

the pleasure of doing it. The late John Richard 
Green was perhaps the first man to really popularize 
the subject in his "Short History of the English 
People." His work has been carried on by Professor 
C. R. L. Fletcher of Magdalen College, Oxford, 
whose " Introductory History of England " is now 
complete ; and offers not only to the student, but to 
the everyday reader as well, a brilliant picture of the 
growth from humble beginnings of the great nation, 
whose sons have determined the destiny of the North 
American continent. This work strikes an entirely 
new note in historical narration. 

Mr. Fletcher loves fairness and hates humbug 
and heroics, whether of the popular, the political, or 
the personal brand. He does not consider pictur- 
esqueness so much as character. He displays a 
lofty standard of common-sense and a love of 
rational righteousness, which, combined with keen 
critical capacity and a power of expressing himself 
with pregnant terseness, results in his history being 
not only profound in political sagacity, but extra- 
ordinarily bright and sparkling as a piece of liter- 
ature. 

In fact, though one is apt to suspect epigram and 
brilliancy in a historian, this work is a solid contri- 
bution to the subject, lightened by flashes of wit, 
and permeated by a generous sense of humor, in 
sympathy with modern methods of thought and 
expressed in modern language. 

The fact that the first two volumes have already 
taken the place of Green's History in more than one 
of the largest Universities in the East shows that the 
merits of Mr. Fletcher's work have been quickly 
recognized.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 53 



Ajax defied the lightning with some sort of 
poetic justification ; but why should anyone wish 
to defy the stars ? They surely do not threaten 
us, and if in fact they control human destiny (as 
astrology claims) it would be futile to seek to 
resist their decrees. Nevertheless, " defiance to 
the stars" is the slogan of the newest movement 
in poetry — a movement born in Italy early in 
the present year, and rejoicing in the name of 
Futurism. " Erect on the pinnacle of the world 
we hurl forth once more our defiance to the 
stars ! " These are the plain words which close 
the manifesto of the Futurists, and the entire 
truculent document seems to indicate that its 
authors mean business. 

This manifesto, which proceeds from Milan 
(following by a century and a year the Milan 
Decree that helped to make world-history), is an 
extremely interesting piece of writing. It is 
signed by one Signor F. T. Marinetti, who edits 
" Poesia," which is a literary review of some four 
years' standing, henceforth to be the organ of the 
new school of literature. No description could 
do justice to the present proclamation of the 
Rights of Man in his character as a literary 
artist. Our own best efforts would stand in 
pale contrast to Signor Marinetti 's flamboyant 
and explosive diction. Here are a few of the 
features of the programme : 

" We wish to sing the love of danger, the habit of 
energy and of daring. The essential elements of our 
poetry will be courage, audacity, and revolt. Literature 
having hitherto magnified pensive quietude, ecstasy, and 
slumber, we wish to exalt aggressive action, feverish 
insomnia, the firm step, the perilous leap, the slap and 
the fisticuff. . . . The poet must spend himself with 
heat, brilliance, and prodigality, to augment the enthu- 
siastic fervor of the primordial elements. . . . Poetry 
should be a violent assault upon unknown forces, demand- 
ing that they lie down at the feet of man. . . . We wish 
to glorify war — sole hygiene of the world — militarism, 
patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchist, the 
beautiful Idea that slays, and scorn for women. We 
wish to destroy museums and libraries, to combat 
morality, feminism, and all forms of opportunism and 
utilitarian cowardice." 

There is no doubt that literature, thus con- 
ceived, would no longer bear much resemblance 
to the domesticated product with which we are 
used to play, as with a tame cat. The household 
pet would renew its ancestral jungle character, 



34 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



surprising us not a little by the transforma- 
tion. 

The plank about museums and libraries in the 
Futurist platform is explained with much feel- 
ing later on. Most artists chafe a little under 
the restraining grasp of the dead hand, however 
appreciative of its salutary influence ; but our 
fiery Futurists cast it off altogether. This sub- 
ject is treated with appropriate scorn, which is 
worked up into a fine frenzy at the close. 

" We wish to free Italy from its gangrene of pro- 
fessors, archaeologists, ciceroni, and antiquaries ; we wish 
to rid her of the innumerable museums which cover her 
with innumerable cemeteries. ... To admire an old 
picture is to pour our sentiment into a funeral urn in- 
stead of hurling it forth in violent gushes of action and 
productiveness. Will you thus consume your best 
strength in this useless admiration of the past, from 
which you will forcibly (forcementj come out exhausted, 
lessened and trampled? " 

Museums, libraries, and academies are the 
" graveyards of lost efforts, the calvaries of cru- 
cified dreams, the registers of broken-down 
springs (elans brises)." They may serve the 
old and feeble after a fashion, but we, " the 
young, the strong, and the living," will have 
none of them. " Welcome, therefore, the good 
incendiaries with their sooty fingers ! They 
come ! They come ! Set fire to the book- 
shelves ! Turn the canals that they may flood 
the museum vaults ! Let the glorious old can- 
vases float adrift ! Seize picks and hammers ! 
Sap the foundations of the venerable towns ! " 
Thus in true Berserker spirit will the Futurist 
clear his path. Thus will he sweep away the 
old art, as Nietzche has swept away the old 
morality, to make way for the new. 

It is amusing to observe the cavortings of our 
young lions, and to hear them roar, for we know 
that Bottom is their real prototype, and imagine 
that the most frantic among them would hesitate 
before giving literal effect to their threats. That 
they are young would go without saying, but 
they think it necessary to tell us in so many 
words. 

" The oldest among us are thirty; we thus have at 
least ten years in which to accomplish our task. When 
we are forty, let younger and more daring men cast us 
into the waste-basket like useless manuscripts. They 
will come against us from far away, from all quarters, 
leaping on the cadence of their first poems, clawing the 
air with their crooked fingers, and sniffing, at the gates 
of academies, the grateful savour of our putrefying 
minds (la bonne odeur de nos esprits pourrissants), already 
dedicated to the catacombs of the library. But we 
shall not be there. They will find us at last on a 
winter's night, in the open country, in a sad iron shed 
pitter-pattered by the monotonous rain, huddled round 
our trepidating aeroplanes, warming our hands at the 
miserable fire made with our present-day books flicker- 



ing merrily in the sparkling flight of their images. They 
will riot around us, panting with anguish and spite, and, 
exasperated by our proud and dauntless courage, they 
will rush to kill us, their hatred all the stronger be- 
cause their hearts will be drunk with love and admira- 
tion for us. And powerful and healthsome Injustice 
(la forte et la saine Injustice) will then burst radiantly in 
their eyes. For art can only be violence, cruelty, and 
injustice." 

But perhaps we have quoted enough of this 
turgid rodomontade. It ends with the phrase 
we have chosen for a title — "Erect on a pin- 
nacle of the world we hurl forth once more our 
defiance to the stars! " It is all set forth in a 
quadruple issue of " Poesia," with a cover pic- 
turing the Futurist on his pinnacle, not exactly 
defying the stars, but slaying with his shafts 
the dragons of the slime. The contents of 
this extraordinary publication consist chiefly of 
opinions, expressed personally to the editor or 
through the press, concerning his new propa- 
ganda. They come from various parts of the 
world, and may be had in the Italian, French, 
Spanish, German, and English languages. The 
briefest of these opinions, which is also the most 
pointed, is from M. Jules Clare tie, and injects 
a note of sanity into the discussion. 

" Dear Poet : Do you not fear the ironical wink of 
the defied stars? And leave us at least Montaigne — 
of whom I am sure — and Monna Lisa, who can now no 
longer deceive anyone. Her smile, believe me, is a part 
of Futurism." 

A less urbane rebuke than this might not be 
undeserved. A pronouncement that declares 
an automobile to be a more beautiful object 
than the Victory of Samothrace, that derides 
the Gioconda as artistic aliment for doddering 
aesthetes only, that describes Signor Fogazzaro 
as a poet for imbeciles, that exalts the brute in 
man and scorns the spiritual essence, — such a 
pronouncement is fair game for any sportsman 
who thinks it worth his ammunition. 

But we are not disposed to go gunning for our 
cocky Futurists. After all, they are young, and 
much may be allowed them for that. Their 
extravagance has a nucleus of sanity, and is not 
much wilder than the extravagance that has 
accompanied many of the really important revo- 
lutions in taste and artistic practice. Revolt 
has always been one of the most effective agents 
of literary advance. It was revolt 

" From jigging veins of rhyming mother wits 
And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay," 

that heralded the Elizabethan drama. It was 
revolt from artificiality and mannerism that 
inspired the " Lyrical Ballads " and renewed 
the youth of English poetry a century ago. It 
was revolt from the bondage of a classical tradi- 



1909.] 



THE DIAL

tion that informed the romantic movement in 
Germany and transformed the literature of that 
country. It was revolt that bore " Hernani " 
to triumph in France, and CEhlenschlager in 
Denmark, and Ibsen in Norway, and the coterie 
of u De Nieuwe Gids " in Holland, and Swin- 
burne and Morris in England, and Poe and 
Whitman in America. Only, it is to be observed 
that the revolt which is mere mouthing, and does 
not justify itself by its artistic fruits, is of all 
futilities the most ridiculous. Let our Futurists 
show that they have it in them to enrich the 
literature of the modern world, and it will be 
easy to forgive the damnable faces and rhetorical 
contortions with which their mission is pro- 
claimed. By way of caution to any who may 
indulge in a too unguarded criticism of Signor 
Marinetti and his gallant band of star-defiers, 
we note that the last page of " Poesia " contains 
the proces-verbal of a duel in which the editor 
figured three months ago, and in which his luck- 
less opponent received " une blessure pene- 
traiite, de trois centimetres environ, a Vavant- 
bras droit, dans la region musculaire." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A favorite New England story-teller has 
been taken from us, and readers of New England 
tales of the good old kind that numbers now but 
very few writers will mourn. Miss Sarah Orne 
Jewett, who died at her ancestral home, South 
Berwick, Maine, on the twenty-fourth of last month, 
in the sixtieth year of her age, was educated at the 
Berwick Academy, and received the honorary degree 
of Litt,D. from Bowdoin College. From her father, 
the late Dr. Theodore H. Jewett, she derived some 
of those qualities that made her so successful a 
writer ; and it was that father whom she had chiefly 
in mind in writing her story of " A Country Doctor." 
The opportunities she enjoyed of seeing and studying 
types of New England character in accompanying 
her father on his professional rounds must have been 
many, and they were put to good use. As early as 
her twentieth year she became a contributor to " The 
Atlantic Monthly." in whose pages the larger part of 
her work originally appeared. She tried her pen in 
three departments of prose literature, — the plain 
New England tale, sometimes expanded to the length 
of a novel ; the historical romance (see " The Tory 
Lover," one of her later books) : and the popular 
chronicle of historic events (''The Story of the 
Normans "). But the short story of that village life 
with which she was so familiar called forth her best 
powers. In this she ranks not far below Mrs. Stowe 
among the dead, and Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman 
among the living. 



The meeting of American- librarians at 
Bretton Woods. N. H.. early this month, was the 
third largest in the history of the Library Associa- 
tion — only Magnolia (with Boston as an annex) in 
1902. and Narragansett Pier in 1906, having 
attracted larger gatherings. The presence of over 
eight hundred of the active library workers of the 
country attests the interest of the members in matters 
pertaining to their profession. Many able and sug- 
gestive papers were read, and many old and some 
new subjects of library administration were threshed 
over. The lights and shades of library commission 
work furnished material for the most popular of the 
meetings and discussions. The National League of 
Library Commissions gave itself up to reciting and 
hearing the experiences, serious and laughable, of 
library workers in many States, from Nebraska to 
Maryland, and numerous traits of human nature, 
especially rural human nature, were amusingly 
illustrated by the stories of these missionaries in the 
cause of culture. This session must have offered 
the strongest possible contrast to that of the Bibli- 
ographers of America, held the same day and in a 
sedater mood. 

A PLEASANT INCIDENT OF THE COMMENCEMENT 

season was the bestowal of the Litt-D. degree on 
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe by Brown University — 
while the band played her " Battle Hymn " and all 
present rose to their feet in her honor. President 
Faunce's well-chosen words in presenting the di- 
ploma were these : " Doctor of Letters, Julia Ward 
Howe, Boston, Massachusetts, author, philanthropist, 
mother, friend of the slave, the prisoner, and all 
who suffer, singer of the battle-hymn of freedom, 
allied with Brown University through her distin- 
guished husband, allied with all educators through 
her faith that it is the last of life for which the first 
was made." Mrs. Howe said of the degree conferred 
upon her: "It is doubly precious to me because my 
grandfather received here his degree of A. B., I 
cannot tell when, but it was long before I was born. 
Then, too, my husband, Dr. Howe, was a graduate. 
It is a most beautiful occasion, and I was indeed 
much pleased when the band played the ' Battle 
Hymn.' " Seldom has the old Baptist meeting-house 
at Providence, where the Brown commencement 
exercises are held, witnessed a more noteworthy 
event, and never before, one can safely affirm, has it 
seen the decoration of so youthful a nonagenarian — 
or, indeed, of any nonagenarian. 

The library training-class is doing good 
work. The educating and " breaking in " of appren- 
tices by this practical method, where the public 
library is large enough to afford the requisite facil- 
ities, and is also in constant need of new recruits to 
its working force, cannot be too highly commended. 
As compared with that admirable institution, the 
library school, there is a saving of time and expense 
to the learner, and an avoidance of that sometimes 
excessive devotion to theory which a two or three

years' course at Albany might conceivably encour- 
age in some zealous students. Local conditions and 
local needs are also better learned in the library 
training class, and greater surety of immediate 
employment at the end of the course may sometimes 
be counted on. The Springfield (Mass.) Public 
Library has just sent out its annual circular to Smith 
and Mount Holyoke colleges and to local high 
schools, announcing the approaching examinations 
for admission to a training class of six, the course 
to cover ten months (less four weeks of vacation) 
and to involve forty-three hours of work each week, 
including two evenings. One month's instruction 
and practice in each of the library's several depart- 
ments will be given, and there will be prescribed 
reading as well as regular lectures or talks. The 
circular ends with the following salutary reminders 
and counsels : "A love of reading is not alone suffi- 
cient equipment. A high-school education or its 
equivalent is regarded as the minimum requirement, 
and among the chief qualifications besides culture 
and general information are good health, earnest- 
ness, accuracy, and tact. Library work must be a 
vocation rather than an avocation, and makes the 
same demands on the applicant's time and interest 
that are made by business. It offers a delightful 
field for persons who unite with culture an earnest 
love for work of a broadly educational and human- 
tiarian character." 

A SPECTACULAR PRESENTATION OF SCHILLER'S 

" Joan of Arc " was enjoyed by fifteen thousand 
on-lookers at the Harvard Stadium on Tuesday 
evening of Commencement week. Three years ago 
the "Agamemnon" of iEschylus was successfully 
given on the same spot in the original Greek ; but 
on this later occasion it was wisely decided to resort 
to the vernacular, and accordingly Miss Anna Swan- 
wick's version, revised by Mr. George Sylvester 
Viereck, was used. Miss Maude Adams and a com- 
pany of players selected from Mr. Charles Frohman's 
dramatic forces filled the various parts, and were 
aided by a host of well-trained supernumeraries in 
the battle scenes, the coronation pageant, and else- 
where. So elaborate and magnificent a presentation 
of this drama was surely never before seen, and may 
well never be seen again. Schiller himself could 
not have failed to be delighted and to pronounce it 
grandios in the extreme, had he been one of the vast 
audience ranged semi-circularly about that end or 
segment of the stadium appropriated to the purposes 
of the play. The leading part was well conceived 
and interpreted, as was to have been expected of Miss 
Adams, and her support was good. The pecuniary 
profits of the performance go, most fittingly, to the 
Germanic Museum of Harvard University. 

Cold storage for unused literature was 
the theme of an animated discussion by the Library 
Association at its recent gathering in the White 
Mountains. Seven years ago President Eliot of 
Harvard read a paper before the Association on 



" Storage Libraries," advocating the keeping of 
obsolete and other unused literature in storage. A 
different sort of storage was that advocated by 
Librarian Gould in his address as President of 
the Association, who presented a scheme of library 
coordination which would include the establishment 
of central storehouses of books to be loaned to out- 
lying libraries, thus saving much expense of dupli- 
cation and vastly increasing the usefulness of the 
smaller and poorer libraries. These central reser- 
voirs would also serve some of the purposes of 
clearing-houses, while each would specialize in the 
collecting of literary material having to do with its 
own region. A fund of a hundred thousand dollars, 
or perhaps more, he generously estimates as neces- 
sary for the establishment of one such regional 
library, and " a single great gift like that which was 
made two or three years since for purposes of edu- 
cation in this country, would suffice to put the whole 
system in operation." (Perhaps the Laird of Skibo 

will take note of this.)

The poet and the potentate are on the best 
of terms with each other as long as the man of 
song hymns the praises of the monarch and causes 
his muse to sing the divine right of kings. But for 
democratic, iconoclastic,, convention-defying poets — 
especially if these poets have a keen wit and a caustic 
humor — the sovereigns of the earth have small use. 
So little use, indeed, has the present German Em- 
peror for poetic genius which refuses to consecrate 
itself to the greater glory of the powers that be, that 
he cannot abide the silent presence of such genius 
even in the seemingly inoffensive form of mute bust 
or inanimate statue. Accordingly, on coming into 
possession of the late Empress of Austria's beautiful 
villa at Corfu, Kaiser Wilhelm makes all haste to get 
rid of the statue of Heine that has so long adorned 
it. The poet who has given the world those match- 
less " short swallow-flights of song that dip their 
wings in tears and skim away " possesses no charm 
to soothe the Hohenzollern breast, and away he is 
bundled to his Hamburg publishers, for a paltry ten 
thousand marks or so — to the house that has long 
befriended him, and that will now, let us hope, con- 
tinue its protection. The whole incident serves as 
a striking fulfilment of Heine's dying prophecy : 
" Heine ne meurt pas come le premier venu, et les 
griff es du tigre survivront au tigre lui-meme." 

The sublimity of egotism has been attained, it 
would seem, by the gifted author of " Cyrano de 
Bergerac." Before selling his Paris house to a 
banker, as he recently did, M. Rostand sealed up 
the door and placed a bronze tablet to mark the 
threshold once pressed by the foot of genius. All 
inferior mortals will henceforth enter by an unsancti- 
fied portal constructed in another place. Self-conceit 
like that is fairly awe-compelling. Even Whistler 
did not surpass it in his reply to an admirer who 
had declared that there were only two great painters, 
Velasquez and Whistler. "Why drag in Velas-

quez ? " demanded the great and only Whistler. 
Disraeli the inimitable is said to have remarked, 
without blush or tremor : " When I want to read a 
good book, I write one." The delightfully caustic 
Henry Clapp, of journalistic fame, was once asked 
what a certain pompous and self-satisfied clergyman, 
temporarily without a pulpit, was at that moment 
doing. " He is waiting for a vacancy in the Trinity," 
was the quick rejoinder. Possibly the gentleman 
might have expressed it differently, but the reply 
was felt to be apt. Charles Sumner displayed mag- 
nificent self-confidence when, speaking of certain 
political changes that threatened to leave him a 
statesman without a party, he appealed to the large 
audience before him and demanded : " What, then, is 
to become of me ? " Another statesman of splendid 
egotism was rather cruelly punished in a witty 
Tejoinder attributed to General Grant. The victim 
of the retort was not present, but had been spoken 
of by another as not believing in the Bible. " Why 
should he ? " asked the laconic man of military deeds ; 
u he did n't write it." It has been held by certain 
worldly-wise men and women that the crime of 
wrong-doing is in being detected. One might almost 
maintain, in contemplating the effrontery of those 
who have a genius for self-conceit, and for something 
else as well, that the sin of egotism lies in not being 
able to u carry it off " successfully. 

Critical power and creative power are, for 
some inscrutable reason, seldom found united in the 
same person. A painter one day caught an art- 
critic in the act of pointing out certain defects in one 
of the artist's canvases. " But you could not paint 
a picture to save your life," remonstrated the man 
of palette and brushes ; " what right, then, have you 
to criticise the pictures of others ? " The critic 
bided his time and invited the artist to breakfast, 
where he served him an egg that had outlasted its 
pristine freshness. One taste was enough to draw 
from the guest an expression of unfavorable com- 
ment. " But you could not lay an egg to save your 
life," retorted the host ; " what right, then, have you 
to criticize the eggs of other people's hens ? " A 
recent writer, who happens to be also a college 
instructor in English, eases his bosom of certain 
" confessions," declaring that very few teachers in 
his branch of learning can write — really write. 
They can, of course, compose a thesis or draw up a 
report on their work, or even review a book ; but 
that, he affirms, is not writing. The antagonism 
that has always existed between the man who picks 
to pieces and the man who puts together, and even 
between the corresponding tendencies in the same 
man, will probably continue to the end of time — or 
until the analytic and the synthetic shall merge into 
one. 

A WELL-PATRONIZED LIBRARY FOR COLORED 

readers is an encouraging sign that the things of 
the higher life do not appeal in vain to our negro 
fellow-citizens. The public library of Louisville, 



Kentucky, has published a small folder that describes 
its recently-opened branch library for the colored 
race. There are said to be forty thousand inhabitants 
of this class in that city, and the library building 
provided for them, similar in all respects to the usual 
Carnegie branch library, cost, with its books and 
other equipment, nearly forty-two thousand dollars. 
Before October of last year, when the new building 
was opened, the branch had been maintained for 
three years in temporary quarters, and had attained 
a circulation of almost thirty-six thousand volumes a 
year. This has now considerably increased, so that an 
average of more than a book a year can be credited 
(or charged) to each colored person. Whether or 
not it is a distinction to be proud of, Louisville is 
said to be the only place in the world to have a 
branch public library for its colored inhabitants; and 
it is already planning the establishment of another. 

Journalism as the subject of a university 
course promises to draw many earnest students. 
The School of Journalism connected with the Uni- 
versity of Missouri has finished its first year and 
presents some encouraging results. While it was at 
first questioned whether more than a score of 
would-be reporters and editors could be attracted to 
the course, there were actually enrolled ninety-seven 
students, including fourteen young women. Seventy- 
four out of this total number entered for the four 
years' course, twenty-three being partial-course stu- 

j dents from other departments of the university. 

| The showing that these school-trained journalists 
will make a few years hence, in competition with 
those who have worked their way in the strain and 
stress of hard every-day "hustle or get left," will 
be watched with interest. But both a priori and a 
posteriori reasoning would seem to warrant expecta- 
tion of good results from the operation of this new 
university department. 

The Teddy bear and the public library 
might seem to represent opposite extremes as 
sources of intellectual quickening and food for the 
mind. The Wisconsin u Library Bulletin," however, 
teaches that any such conception of their relationship 
is erroneous. Among the mentally improving games 
that are played, with official sanction, in the chil- 
dren's room of the Eau Claire Public Library are 
" Toot," the automobile game, which is played with 
cards, " Magic Hoops," " Gogglebug," " The Trolley 
Came Off," much enjoyed by girls, and "Teddy 
Bear," which is thus described : " The ' Teddy Bear ' 
is pinned upon the wall. The players, one at a 
time, glance at the bear, aim with the finger, close 
eyes, walk across the room and endeavor to touch 
the heart of the bear." If this demands too severe 
intellectual application from the little ones, there 
remain " Dancing Dunces " and " Pop-in-taw." The 
public library's sphere of usefulness appears to be 
unlimited. Having already assumed some of the 
functions of the kindergarten, it now usurps the

office of the nursery. Why not establish a merry- 
go-round and side-shows, with perhaps a menagerie 
and a sawdust ring, and serve some of the ends of 
the circus — not peripatetic, but stationary, and open 
every day including Sundays and holidays ? 

" Poison labels " for library books that are 
not altogether trustworthy have been suggested by 
the inventive and resourceful librarian of the Los 
Angeles Public Library, and the suggestion has met 
with approval from many quarters. Abbott's " Life 
of Napoleon," for example, should be conspicuously 
labelled for the benefit of the unwary. Prescott's 
" Conquest of Mexico," with its fascinating picture 
of an Aztec Empire, is another book that should 
display cautionary signals. Froude's delightful 
" History of England " might have a few of Free- 
man's caustic comments pasted on the cover. Such 
bits of authoritative and unsparing criticism would 
thus serve their end much better than if incorporated 
in an annotated catalogue, which the book-borrower 
might not chance to see. In the domain of belles 
lettres it is not proposed to use u poison labels," 
however poisonous some of the fiction may be that 
occasionally creeps into even the best-regulated pub- 
lic library. The wholesomeness or injuriousness of 
works of the imagination is more a matter of opinion 
than is the accuracy or inaccuracy of a learned book. 

Some casual impressions of a modest hero 
were received by the hundreds of participants in 
two recent college commencements. At Williams, 
Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell was made a doctor of laws, 
and the following week saw him receive the master- 
of-arts degree at Harvard. The heartiness of the 
applause that greeted his appearance on both occa- 
sions left no doubt of the high esteem and admiration 
in which this man of daring deeds and consecrated 
life is held by the world at large. It is interesting 
to note that Dr. Grenfell's first impulse to devote 
his life to his present work was received, as he took 
occasion to relate in his address at the Williams 
alumni dinner, from some words that fell from the 
lips of our evangelist Moody in London. 

National library headquarters in Chicago 
will soon be counted as not the least of the quicken- 
ing influences that are promoting public library 
growth in the Central West. By vote of the Amer- 
ican Library Association's Executive Council it has 
finally been decided to carry out the already ex- 
pressed intention to transfer the headquarters from 
Boston to Chicago — an intention hitherto thwarted 
by lack of suitable office accommodations. The 
trustees of the Chicago Public Library extended the 
offer of a large and finely arranged suite of rooms 
in the library building, and the offer was accepted. 
Eastern librarians regret the transfer, although 
many of them recognize the increased opportunities 
for usefulness which the new situation will furnish. 



C OMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TYPE IN THE WORLD. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

My attention has just been called to several com- 
munications, recently printed in your columns, upon the 
subject of type-design. Without illustration it is per- 
haps superfluous to attempt to add anything of value to 
the discussion, which, however, I hope may continue and 
spread until the type-founders awaken to many of the 
enormities that, in the name of improvement, they are 
perpetrating upon the beautiful letters of the early type- 
cutters. 

Mr. Gookin's admirable letter expresses throughout 
my opinions on the subject more precisely than I can 
hope to do, but I wish to emphasize particularly the 
statement made in its concluding paragraph — that the 
most beautiful types are also the easiest to read. I 
speak, of course, only of Roman letters. There are 
many exceedingly beautiful Gothic types, but to our 
modern eyes they are all more or less illegible. The 
world will never go back to reading black-letter, nor 
will any Gothics more admirable than those left us by 
the fifteenth century type-cutters ever be devised. 
Gothic may well be called a dead letter, so far as any 
future development of its forms is concerned. Like the 
cathedrals, it has been done once perfectly, and, aside 
from display lines, no conscious effort to revive its use in 
printing will ever result in more than a curiosity of 
book-making. 

Of the Renaissance or Roman types, then, let us con- 
sider the abstract legibility — that is, of an ideal type 
set in an ideal manner. It is futile to expect any one 
form of letter, even in various sizes, to accommodate 
itself to all sorts of composition. Our modern demands 
upon type for magazine or newspaper work will seldom 
permit the use of an ideal letter without detriment to 
the page as a whole. The most beautifully printed 
magazine of the present day is probably " The Monthly 
Review " published in London; but it is a far cry from 
its broad pages of twelve-point Scotch type to the 
crowded double-column illustrated pages of most of our 
periodicals. The demands of each upon the type- 
designer are quite different, and must be met in quite 
different ways. 

It is obvious, therefore, that the laboratory tests, 
while doubtless interesting and instructive, will be of 
little practical use unless all the possible variations of 
letter-forms are experimented upon — which would 
appear to be a task of herculean proportions. Inci- 
dentally it would be interesting to know what types 
have been used in determining that certain letters are 
" offenders." In other words, when we speak of the 
alphabet whose alphabet do we mean — Ratdolt's or 
Estienne's, Caslon's or Baskerville's, Euschede"s or 
Bodoni's, Morris's or Goodhue's? It is as profitless to 
discuss an alphabet, abstractly, as it would be a color. 
Concrete examples are absolutely necessary — for a 
starting-point at least. 

Personally, I have not the least hesitation in choosing 
amongst the many admirable examples we have had 
given us. From both aesthetic and utilitarian stand- 
points, the Roman letter was, like the Gothic, done once, 
perfectly and for all time, when Nicolas Jenson cut 
the type that appears perhaps in its greatest perfection 
in his " Eusebius " of 1470. I have never seen the 
" Cicero " of the same year, but many pages of the 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



39 



" Eusebius " are so lightly inked that the letter-forms 
may be examined almost as in a smoke-proof. After 
twelve years' study of it, minute comparison with almost 
every other Roman letter, ancient and modern, and two 
or three unsuccessful attempts to reproduce its forms 
in modern matrices, I believe it to be at once the most 
beautiful and the most legible type in the world. Modi- 
fications of it there may properly be for special purposes, 
and for modern readers some alteration of set and 
ahgnment may be desirable ; but in variety and refine- 
ment of form and in noble proportion, improvement of it 
is forever impossible. 

Compared with many another of the beautiful early 
types, it is, at first glance, by no means striking in 
appearance. There is an almost total absence of super- 
fluous or distracting features; but this very quality of 
reticence is one of its chief claims to stand as the finest 
model upon which to base our efforts in devising new 
founts. And these new founts will, to my mind, be suc- 
cessful in so far as they approximate Jenson's, and unsuc- 
cessful in proportion to their divergence. 

I naturally dissent from Mr. McQuilkin's character- 
ization of the Jenson as "spiky" (unless, indeed, he 
refers to the so-called 'Jenson ' of the type-founders). 
Rather does it fulfil his desire for " a good full-bodied 
letter with an honest printing face." I heartily agree 
with his description of Old-Style as " graceful," and 
admit cheerfully the " high ascenders and low de- 
scenders " but again differ from him on the point of 
" obscure thinnesses and obtrusive thicknesses." These, 
I must maintain, are features of Modern Roman types 
in contradistinction to Old-Style . 

In comparison with the early Old-Styles, the first 
Modern types were lacking in purity of form and defi- 
cient in proportion. They nevertheless possessed great 
distinction and style, and none more than Bodoni's. We 
have gone on reproducing their more obvious or super- 
ficial features, or else combining them with the qualities 
of Old-Style, until at last most of our body types are 
hybrids, possessing few marks of good breeding and 
almost invariably wanting in that saving grace of the 
earlier Modern letters — style. 

In conclusion, let me say that inasmuch as both Mr. 
French and Mr. Gookin have done me the honor of com- 
mending the modification of Caslon made for " Geofroy 
Tory," it may interest them and others to know that, 
though set by hand, it was cast upon a type-setting 
machine. With slight modifications, machine-setting 
also would have been quite practicable. I cannot think 
it quite so successful an experiment as they say, but it 
may help to prove that if the machines cannot give us 
beautiful type, the difficulty lies somewhere else than in 
the mechanical department. Bruce Rogers.

"THE LAW" EST SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
In his latest eccentricity entitled " Is Shakespeare 
Dead ? " Mark Twain is quick to believe, or to pretend 
to believe, that the Stratford Shakespeare could not 
have written the Shakespearean plays because he was 
not a lawyer. He finds that the author of the plays, 
whoever he was, was an expert in " that wonderful trade, 
that complex and intricate trade, that awe-compelling 
trade " — the law. If he (Mark Twain) were appointed 
arbiter to decide " whether Shakespeare wrote Shake- 
speare or not," he " would place before the debaters only 



the one question, Was Shakespeare ever a practicing 
lawyer? and leave everything else out." His conclu- 
sion of the whole matter is that " the man who wrote 
Shakespeare's Works knew all about law and lawyers. 
Also that the man could not have been the Stratford 
Shakespeare — and was n't." 

Resisting the temptation to point out other weak 
places in the argument, — if argument it can be called, — 
I will undertake nothing more than a single comparison, 
handing it over to the reader without comment. 

In a thoughtful essay on " The MakiDg of a Great 
Poem," with which Mr. Charles W. Hodell concludes his 
scholarly study of " The Old Yellow Book, Source of 
Browning's 'The Ring and the Book'" (reviewed in 
The Dial for November 16, 1908), the author-editor 
says : 

" In the legal lore and technical phraseology so abundantly 
displayed throughout the Poem, and especially in Books 
VIII. and IX., the Poet evidently depended very largely 
upon what he found in the Book. This display of out-of-the- 
way technical lore has perhaps caused some readers to stand 
in awe of the learned acquirements of Browning in the eccle- 
siastical law. But the study of the Book makes it evident 
that he learned about all of his law from the Book." 

Concluding this phase of his subject, the critic adds: 
" We have here an interesting example of how easily and 
thoroughly a master artist may gain sufficient technical lore, 
even in a difficult field, to astonish his critics. And this 
may perhaps offer a striking truth to those who guess at 
Shakespeare's occupations by his chance references to tech- 
nical subjects, no matter how accurate they may be."

WAS SWINBURNE SAVED FROM DROWNING BY 

MAUPASSANT ? 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Mr. Edmund Gosse, in some personal recollections of 
Swinburne published in the June number of the " Fort- 
nightly Review" of London, has this to say of the 
English poet's narrow escape from drowning at Etretat 
in 1870: 

" He was caught by the race of the tide under the Port 
d'Amont, because of the weakness of his stroke. He was 
pursued, floating like a Medusa with shining hair outspread, 
and was caught a long way out to sea, behind the Petite 
Porte, by a yachtsman who, oddly enough, happened to be 
Guy de Maupassant. I may record that, in describing this 
incident to me not long after it happened, Swinburne said, 
etc. . . . These incidents are, I think, not mentioned by Guy 
de Maupassant in his very picturesque account of the occur- 
rence." 

I happen to have at hand Maupassant's account of 
the affair, and the two stories do not agree, — for which 
one of several possible reasons, I shall not attempt to 
settle. Here is what the Frenchman says: 

"... Un matin, vers dix heures, des marins arriverent en 
criant qu'un nageur se noyait sous la Porte d'amont. Bs 
prirent un bateau et je les accompagnai. Le nageur, ignor- 
ant le terrible courant de maree qui passe sous cette arcade, 
avait ete entrained puis recueilli par une barque qui pechait 
derriere cette porte, appelee communement la Petite Porte. 

" J'appris, le soir meme, que le baigneur imprudent 6tait 
un poete anglais, M. Algernon-Charles Swinburne. . . . 

" II [Mr. Powell] apprit que j'avais essaye, trop tard, de 
porter secours a son ami. . . ." 

Maupassant, it will be seen, expressly states that he 
had nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with the saving 
of Swinburne's life. r G y Temple House.

Memoirs of a Many-Sided Man.* 



There are, here and there, and in every age, 
a few variously gifted men who do many things 
so extremely well that in doing each they seem 
to have been born and trained for that and noth- 
ing else. Such a man was the late Nathaniel 
Southgate Shaler, whose fragment of Autobiog- 
raphy, ending with his coming of age, and sup- 
plemented by an account of his later years from 
the competent hand of his widow, is now pub- 
lished in a substantial octavo volume, with illus- 
trations, numerous extracts from Shaler's large 
correspondence, and tributes from the pens of 
some of his many admirers and friends. 

Born in Kentucky, of good Southern and 
slave-holding stock, educated by himself (the 
best of teachers), by a private tutor, and finally 
by the great Agassiz and other instructors at 
the Lawrence Scientific School, he led a life of 
so constant and strenuous application to enlarg- 
ing the bounds of human knowledge that his 
comparatively early death in 1906, at the age 
of sixty-five, may reasonably be ascribed to the 
over-taxing of a frame constitutionally lacking 
in robustness. Even the briefest outline of 
Professor Shaler's full and useful life should 
include some mention of his short term of 
service as a soldier in the field, fighting for the 
cause against which most of his earlier friends 
were enlisted. That he allowed no thirst for 
military glory to quench his ardor for scientific 
research is fortunate. He had skill in the use 
of arms and no lack of the fighting spirit, but 
higher claims prevailed. 

Of the unusual quality of his mind, many 
illustrations could be given. A striking proof 
of rare endowments is found in his remarkable 
union of memory, verbal memory even, with an 
early bent for original research. He speaks of 
having learned, in youth, some fifty thousand 
lines of poetry in various languages, a large part 
of which remained with him to the end. In 
those early days of restless and wide-ranging 
inquiry, he tells us that the abstractions of meta- 
physics had a peculiar fascination for him, and 
even the fatal charm of Hegel claimed him as 
a willing victim. But his maturer judgment 
upon the value of metaphysics may be gathered 
from the following : 

" The field of metaphysical speculation opened before 
me as a new universe; of all the vagarious devotions

of my childhood and youth, this took the firmest hold 
upon me. I began to read all I could of philosophers 
and their writings. The Mercantile Library in Cincinnati 
[across the river from the Shaler home in Kentucky] 
had many such books which I devoured. I recall the 
pleasure with which I bought a set of G. H. Lewes's 
' History of Philosophy,' a rather poor book as I now see 
it, but then a treasure in my eyes. I had two German 
manuals, the titles of which I have forgotten. The curi- 
ous thing about this prolonged excursion is that I really 
got something out of it. I appear even to have gained an 
adequate idea of Kant's « Critique,' though I doubt if I 
could compass it to-day without much labor. With all this 
intense interest in the speculations of men and the history 
of the evolutions of their systems, I had no real belief in 
the essential verity of them. They charmed me as an 
exercise of wits much as did chess, to which at this time 
and at various later periods I became addicted." 

The confessed weakness in Shaler's educa- 
tional equipment lay in the field of mathematics, 
and he deplored to the end his ignorance of the 
calculus, which would have aided him in some 
of his researches. The wonder is that so active 
and so quickly assimilating an intelligence 
should not have laid hold of this branch of learn- 
ing, as it did of so many others. 

The account of Agassiz's original way of 
examining and instructing his pupil from Ken- 
tucky is of exceeding interest. The great natur- 
alist affected to hold in contempt the lad's 
previous acquisitions in zoology, botany, and 
geology, and subjected him to a rather rough 
and trying novitiate ; then, with a suddenness 
of transition that puzzled the pupil, he became 
most friendly and communicative, and the two 
entered into a sort of comradeship that proved 
extremely pleasant and profitable to at least the 
younger man, and probably to both. 

Professor Shaler's various expeditions in 
search of knowledge, on sea and land, to glaciers 
and mountains and volcanoes, would fill volumes 
with interesting narrative and noteworthy inci- 
dent. In his early manhood he climbed Vesu- 
vius while it was in eruption, and is said to have 
been the first person to look into the crater of 
an active volcano. Such account as he gives of 
his exploring journey to Anticosti and Labrador 
shows him to have been heedless of danger when 
the thirst for information in matters of science 
was upon him. But the inflicting of suffering 
on dumb animals, even in the cause of science, 
was unbearable to him. He once felt constrained 
to kill a wounded seal in order to end its agony, 
but the creature's face haunted him for the rest 
of his days, and he never again took an animal's 
life. " Some of my friends," he writes, "esteem 
this fanciful softness ; it does not seem to me so,

the conditions required the action. It is the 
sudden and brutal assault of the hunter on the 
unoffending creature which breeds this pain." 
A few more sentences from the Anticosti chap- 
ter will be of interest. 

" As all those who have made hard campaigns know, 
discomfort, such as we became accustomed to, much 
lessens the love of life. In fact, that fancy for contin- 
uous existence is in some measure the product of ease 
and comfort, while what we call bravery is largely but 
merely a hard-minded state which suffering induces 
even where men are not clearly conscious that they are 
in torment. . . . Probably the largest profit I found in 
the voyage about the shores of the St. Lawrence came 
to me from the discomfort and the danger there encoun- 
tered. Our conditions were in both these regards 
rather worse than those of the common fisherman; for 
in addition to the labor and trials of those who go down 
to the sea for fish, we had to cleave to lee shores and to 
fight our way through the surf to study the land. It 
was very hard work in fairly hard danger. . . . All this 
was well for us, for the best you can do for a boy is to 
expose him to hardships which bring him nigh to death." 

Coming from the pen of one whose own edu- 
cation was gained by determined and independ- 
ent effort in a chosen direction, and to whom la 
mollesse was the most unpardonable of human 
weaknesses, the following remarks are worth 
pondering : 

" Here let me turn aside for a word concerning the 
grim aspect of our so-called education, which makes it 
well-nigh impossible for our youth of the higher classes 
to have any intimate contacts with men who may teach 
him what is the real nature of his kind. He sees those 
only who are so formalized by training and the uses of 
society that they show him a work of art in human shape. 
He thus has to deal with his fellows in terms which are 
not those of real human nature, and thereby much of his 
own is never awakened. He may live through long fair- 
appearing years, yet fail to have the experiences neces- 
sary to humanize him fully. I have known many an 
ignorant sailor or backwoodsman who, because he had 
been brought into sympathetic contact with the primitive 
qualities of his kind, was humanely a better educated 
man than those who pride themselves on their culture. 
The gravest problem of civilization is in my opinion how 
we are to teach human quality in a system which tends 
ever more and more to hide it." 

Shaler's debt of heredity to his mother was 
acknowledged by him to be great, and her 
moulding influence in his formative years was 
all-important. So manly a man's confession of 
obligation to the charm and stimulus and refin- 
ing power of female companionship is not to be 
lightly dismissed. He says : 

" I would I could have set down a fit acknowledgment 
of my debt through all my days to the women whose 
influence has entered into my life and shaped for the 
best whatever has developed in me. I feel that I can- 
not do this part of my task even to myself, so it will 
have to remain undone. It is, however, fit to say that 
it has been my good fortune from the age of fifteen years 
on, to be always in large measure controlled by women 



of high character. For this I am devoutly thankful; 
for it kept me from the pit whereto I have seen so many 
go. While a man should be a man's man in quality, 
taking his measure from his relations with his own sex, 
in my opinion he cannot attain his full stature without 
the influence of women. Of himself alone the male 
human is a mere fragment of his kind ; he attains to his 
humanity through the shaping influence of its better half." 

In her book, " The Masters of Fate," pub- 
lished three years ago, Mrs. Shaler took occa- 
sion to present a picture of her husband battling 
almost daily with a fatal malady and holding 
death at bay month after month before the end 
finally came. His fortitude under the torment 
and the terror of angina pectoris, which would 
seize upon him in the classroom or on the lec- 
ture platform and compel a pause until the vital 
forces regained the upper hand, was something 
far finer than heroism in battle, because gener- 
ally unknown and unrecognized. The wife's con- 
tinuation, therefore, of her husband's unfinished 
life-story could not fail to be an admiring trib- 
ute to his many virtues, while at the same time 
it is, by help of numerous excerpts from letters 
and data from other sources, a satisfying com- 
pletion of the book. A ten-page list of her hus- 
band's published writings, and twenty double- 
column pages of index, conclude the volume. 
The present review has touched upon but a small 
part of Professor Shaler's earlier life, and has 
dwelt chiefly upon one phase of his virile per- 
sonality. The book itself, and the man's own 
voluminous writings, in prose and verse, must be 
studied for anything like a full acquaintance with 
his many-sided character and varied talents.

u Making Rome Howl, - ix History.* 



On general principles, we do not expect a 
literary sensation from the appearance of a new 
work on a subject so remote as the history of 
Rome. The people interested are comparatively 
few, and not of the type in which sensations are 
most readily induced. Since Signor Ferrero's 
volumes began to appear in the original Italian, 
however, he has been called upon for lectures in 
various parts of the world, publishers have 
scented a profitable market for him in transla- 
tion, and his name has become familiar in the

headlines of the daily newspaper. There is 
always some sort of ability behind a fame of this 
kind, but thoughtful readers hardly need be told 
that immediate newspaper reputation is no 
guarantee of thorough scholarship and reliable 
reasoning powers on the part of an author. The 
ordinary reader, however, will not lift an attract- 
ive literary cloak to hunt for possible flaws in 
the substance and logic underneath. That 
Signor Ferrero has selected and arranged and 
put forth his material in an attractive way, for 
the average intelligent reader, few would be 
found to deny aside from those whose sense of 
propriety will rebel against his frequent airing 
of conscious pride in having " made a hit." 

Aside from an attractive literary dress, our 
author has reaped the harvest of still another 
common source of immediate interest. The 
word has gone out in countless bold headlines 
that this brilliant young Italian has suddenly 
brought tumbling to the ground the whole edi- 
fice of Roman history, as built up and fortified 
by the lifelong labors of scholars of the past, 
such as Mommsen and Duruy, whom he specifi- 
cally names as having almost ceased to be read 
by cultivated people in America as in Europe. 
Human nature has always had a lurking delight 
in seeing things knocked down, provided they 
belong to someone else, and Ferrero undoubt- 
edly owes not a few readers to this impression. 
And so the fact that Caesar and Antony, 
Lucullus and Pompey, Augustus and the social 
legislation of 18 b. c, considered from Ferrero's 
points of view, " have become subjects of fash- 
ionable conversation in Parisian drawing-rooms" 
is not to be hastily taken as proof that the toils 
of his predecessors have been in vain, or that 
the final word on the development and signifi- 
cance of Rome has now been said. 

Ferrero's training has not been such as to give 
him the command of the materials of Roman 
history possessed by a scholar like Mommsen. 
To be free from Mommsen's particular prejudice 
in favor of Caesar and against Cicero is well so 
far as it goes, but to have possessed a greater 
share of Mommsen's enormous store of first- 
hand knowledge of the sources of his subject 
would have given his history a far better chance 
for a place among the indispensable tools of the 
student of the future, even though it might 
have cost it no small part of its popularity of 
the moment in the fashionable conversation of 
Parisian drawing-rooms. A collaborator of 
Lombroso, the author's attention in the past has 
been devoted rather to certain phases of phil- 
osophy and sociology than to the facts of ancient 



history. These studies have apparently fixed 
certain conclusions in his mind so firmly that 
evidence not in harmony with those conclusions 
stands but a poor chance of due consideration. 
To feel perfectly sure in your own mind as to 
what must have been true in any given case con- 
tributes immensely to self-satisfaction and saves 
an enormous amount of labor that might other- 
wise have been spent in sifting evidence. But 
it is beyond human power to tread safely over 
the pitfalls that lie along that road, and the his- 
torian who wishes his work to have lasting influ- 
ence in the field of scholarship must reach his 
goal by another route. 

With Ferrero's insistence upon the import- 
ance to history of the multitude of little things 
going to make up the everyday life of the aver- 
age man, no one is likely to disagree. Even in 
monarchies apparently of the most absolute 
type, the influence of the countless thrusts and 
pushes coming up from below is a powerful 
factor in the movements at the top, and it is too 
true that this field of investigation has as yet 
received no adequate attention. We may take 
it for granted that all branches of ancient his- 
tory will experience more or less dislocation and 
readjustment of previous views, as the evidence 
of this class still available is gradually collected, 
evaluated, and brought to bear. But it is a 
field for prodigious labor, in which perspiration 
will count more than brilliant theorizing. In 
one of his lectures our author takes up the sub- 
ject of wine in Roman history, a theme on which 
any man well versed in Roman literature might 
readily present a very interesting, instructive, 
and suggestive essay. We are distinctly told, 
however, in the preface to the volume containing 
this lecture, that it is an essay after the plan in 
accordance with which it seems to the author 
that economic phenomena should be treated. 
And yet we have merely twenty-five pages of 
interesting reading matter, putting us in com- 
mand of the ascertainable facts of no single fea- 
ture of the subject. Horace is of course drawn 
upon as a witness in the " investigation," but one 
whole side of the testimony which his odes pre- 
sent is left absolutely unmentioned. Whether 
this was through oversight, or intentional, the 
result is a thoroughly distorted Horace. 

Varying readers will naturally get varying 
impressions from the facts and characters of 
ancient history, as described in the available 
sources of information. One is tempted to con- 
clude that Signor Ferrero has developed a habit 
of getting just that impression which is most 
remote from his own idea of the facts, and then

THE DIAL

imagining that everyone else has received the 
very same impression, and taken it as the exact 
truth. His treatment of the story of Antony and 
Cleopatra is a case in point, and a good illustra- 
tion from the fact that the newspapers gave it 
so much sensational attention when the lecture 
in which it is embodied was delivered before 
American audiences. Now a reader may readily 
follow him in this matter just as far as the most 
liberal interpretation of any evidence actually 
adduced will allow, and yet not be driven to any 
radical revision of his estimate of the entire 
episode at all. Still, Ferrero imagines that he 
has effected a tremendous reconstruction, and 
tells us with a deep and evident sense of self- 
satisfaction that the newspapers of Europe, from 
one end to the other, heralded his conclusions as 
" an astounding revelation." Considering the 
fact that the modern newspaper needs in its 
business enough " astounding revelations " each 
morning to fit the pattern evolved beforehand 
for the front page by the headline artist, the 
careful reader has learned not to be astounded 
too easily. To prove that Antony's career in 
the East was not exclusively a matter of romantic 
infatuation, that motives of a more selfish origin 
were mingled with it, is, as a contribution to 
the knowledge of any student of Roman history, 
about on a par with proving to the man who 
has seen the garbage barges dumped that there 
are organic impurities in the waters of New York 
harbor. And yet the romantic infatuation was 
there, and left to the world a story out of which 
it will get entertainment long after the labors 
of many a patient historian of Rome have been 
forgotten. It will take more than a Ferrero, 
too, to bring Julius Caesar down to the level of 
an ordinary temporizing Roman politician, seek- 
ing only to do the thing that would best lend 
itself to his immediate purposes at Rome, and 
unconscious that his acts were big with signifi- 
cance for the future. The recession from 
Mommsen's exaggerated Ca?sarism had gone 
far toward a normal level before Ferrero came 
upon the stage ; but there was an extraordinary 
brain there, and an eye that could see beyond 
the immediate horizon, nevertheless. We all 
know that either the hero or the villain forms 
a tempting subject to the literary artist for over- 
coloring ; but heroes and villains do exist, and 
we cannot go through the pages of history beat- 
ing them down to the general level on the 
abstract principle that " the average of mankind, 
under average conditions, are neither particularly 
good nor particularly bad." 

The fifth volume of " The Greatness and 



Decline " is specifically entitled " The Republic 
of Augustus." The backbone of the volume is 
its vigorous assault upon the idea that Augustus 
either established a monarchy or had any desire 
to do so. On the contrary, we are asked to 
believe that he was simply the elective President 
of a republic, coming up again and again for 
reelection by an electorate entirely at liberty to 
set him aside for a better man if it could find 
one, having a co-president with equal powers at 
his side a part of the time, and devoting his 
energies persistently to an attempt to impart 
renewed vigor to the old forms rather than to 
supplant them, whether openly or by indirection. 
And the author flatters his American readers 
with the statement that they are able to under- 
stand Roman history much more readily than 
Europeans, because they are living under a 
republic of the same kind! We shall only 
remark that he has produced no sufficient evi- 
dence to prove that the government of Italy 
under Augustus was not radically less demo- 
cratic than it had been during the days of 
Cicero's career, to say nothing of such a con- 
stitution as that of the United States, even with 
an Aldrich in charge of the Senate. The terms 
republic and empire as actually used are of 
course vague at best, but to use the United 
States as an illustration of what one means by 
calling the Italy of Augustus a republic can 
lead only to hopeless confusion, if it be not too 
patently absurd to lead at all. The man who is 
to overthrow the scholarship of the past, in this 
or any other field, must be more accurate than 
that. We may concede to Signor Ferrero a 
literary ability which makes Roman history 
interesting. We should be glad if it were 
possible to concede such scholarship and care as 
would make him a safe guide to the readers 
whose interest his literary ability may arouse.

Thomas Hood and his Period.* 



An account of the life of Thomas Hood, and 
j of his share in that interesting period between 
j the great Georgians and the great Victorians, 
j has long been needed. The " Memorials," pre- 
pared by his son and daughter, have not suf- 
| ficed, because their incomplete, though loving, 
record gives no clear and coherent idea of the 
; poet's life. Furthermore, the materials which

considerable information therein contained have 
been inaccessible. To the task, and the oppor- 
tunity, Mr. Walter Jerrold has come with un- 
usual qualifications. He is the grandson of the 
witty Douglas Jerrold, admirer and friend of 
Hood ; he is an experienced biographer ; he 
has already edited the humorist's poetical works. 
We expect much of a biographer so qualified, 
of a biography so opportune ; and, on the whole, 
we are not disappointed. 

Mr. Jerrold's book is destined, however, to 
become a book of reference. It is certainly not 
intended to be merely a " popular biography." 
Both preface and the ensuing chapters testify 
to painstaking endeavors for accuracy and com- 
pleteness. Accuracy seems usually to have been 
attained. Completeness, in the fullest measure, 
has not ; and, in the Life of a poet whose posi- 
tion in his age was so interesting and important, 
a high degree of completeness we have a right to 
demand. For example, a bibliography is lack- 
ing and is sadly needed. Hood deposited in any 
periodical bank open to him, and the record in 
the works collected by his children is not full 
and not always reliable. Mr. Jerrold's failure 
to make up for this deficiency is unfortunate. 
His other faults of omission are venial, and are 
mentionable only because of his apparent adop- 
tion of u thorough " as the motto for his labors. 

The present edition of Mr. Jerrold's book is 
a reprint. When the volume was published in 
England, a reviewer in " The Athenaeum " for 
April 11, 1908, was able to adduce letters of 
Charles Lamb which threw new light upon an 
important episode in the admirable friendship 
between these two men of letters. To the strict- 
ures of this review, which students of Hood 
should consult, may be added another criticism, 
equally slight it is true, yet of the same char- 
acter. The collected edition of Hood's work 
contains some clever dramatic criticism writ- 
ten, so it is asserted, for " The Atlas " — that 
" Sunday news- waggon " which was founded 
in May of 1826. When was Hood dramatic 
critic for " The Atlas " ? The question is 
assuredly not a vital one, yet it is conceivable 
that the historian of the nineteenth century 
stage may wish to have it answered. Since 
" The Atlas " was not in the British Museum 
Library, Mr. Jerrold lets the question drop with 
a guess at 1828 as the date. Yet, as it hap- 
pens, a comparison of the extracts reprinted 
with the dramatic notes of " The Literary 
Gazette " solves the problem, and proves that 
Hood was attached to " The Atlas " from its 
inception in 1826 to some time late in the sum- 



mer of the same year, certainly until after the 
week of August 5, when an opera which he 
reviewed was produced. A letter of October 10, 

1826, from which the contemptuous phrase 
" news-waggon " has just been quoted, suggests 
that he had parted company with the editor by 
that date, while the reviews in " The Atlas " for 

1827, which is in the Yale Library, are ex- 
pressly asserted to be by a new reviewer's hand. 
And, to conclude these minor complaints, why 
are we not referred to that most effective of all 
tributes paid to Hood after his death, Thack- 
eray's Roundabout paper " On a Joke I heard 
from the Late Thomas Hood " ? 

These omissions, save in the case of the bibli- 
ography, are trivial, and not to be taken as an 
indication of untrust worthiness, or as an impli- 
cation that Mr. Jerrold's work has not been 
well done. Indeed, in some respects it has been 
overdone. It is his thoroughness in certain 
fields which has made inconsiderable oversights 
conspicuous. He has flung himself upon the 
doubtful years of Hood's early life, where the 
work of the son and daughter was most unsat- 
isfactory. He has treated these years exhaust- 
ively. In fact, there is some danger that the 
hasty reader may be misled, for he will find as 
many pages devoted to the youthful Hood in 
Scotland as to the poet of 1840-45 — the friend 
of Dickens and Thackeray, and author of " The 
Bridge of Sighs " and " The Song of the Shirt." 
To be sure, we were ignorant of many interest- 
ing circumstances in the humorist's early career, 
until the publication of Mr. Jerrold's book. 
Yet, not equally but doubly interesting is that 
last of Hood's life for which the first was made. 

One feels, to choose an instance of this lack 
of proportion, that a very important episode in 
Hood's later career, his financial failure in 1834, 
might have been given more attention. Mr. 
Jerrold has made it clearer than ever before 
that Hood was too unfortunate in his relations 
with publishers to be altogether blameless. This 
failure in 1834 was a turning-point in his life. 
It drove him abroad, and entailed " comics " 
and ill-health until he died. If we could get at 
the facts of the crisis we might know Hood 
better. Again, one feels the need of a wider 
discussion of Hood's intimate and very import- 
ant connection with the humanitarian movement 
of his time, a relationship which began at least 
as early as 1832, for it was then that he 
answered " Pauper " with, 

" If you love your Dolls and Nancys, 
Don't we make you marry ? " 

The fault is a fault of proportion, and it is a

lack of proportion which is the most serious 
artistic criticism to be made against this volume. 
Mr. Jerrold has been governed in some measure 
by what the " Memorials " lacked, rather than 
what the life of Thomas Hood demanded. The 
result is a book which, for all its excellences, 
leaves a little to be desired. 

I have reserved these excellences until last, 
because they are more apparent than the defects. 
Indeed, they are not only apparent, they are 
most extensive. This life of Hood will prop- 
erly go to its place upon many library shelves 
as the standard reference book for an author 
whose fame, though small, is constant. It is 
trustworthy, and it contains much not elsewhere 
to be found. Furthermore, it should welcomed 
by readers who are interested in the first half of 
the nineteenth century, for the brilliant circle 
of the old " London Magazine " is given the 
essay which it long deserved ; and if the forties 
are stinted the twenties have little to complain 
of at Mr. Jerrold's hand. Nor can lovers of 
Hood afford to be ignorant of the new letters 
here contained, letters which brighten our pic- 
ture of a personality almost Elizabethan in its 
quaintness and most potent in its charm. The 
faults of Mr. Jerrold's book are probably re- 
flected from the infinitely more serious errors 
of the u Memorials " upon which his labors were 
based. It is to be regretted that he has not 
entirely escaped their influence. But, while 
regretting, we are gratefully appreciative of 
his very considerable services to the cause of

History axd Romaxce of the 
Great Lajces.* 



It is a rather curious thing that after remain- 
ing comparatively neglected in current literature 
for so many years, the Great Lakes of North 
America should become the subject of two such 
admirable volumes as those of Mr. Curwood and 
Professor Channing. The story was well worth 
telling, and it has been well told in both of these 
books, which, while they cover the same field, 
are sufficiently dissimilar in plan for each to 
have an interest and value of its own. The 
" Story of the Great Lakes " is a popular his- 
tory of the whole lake region from the days of 
Champlain to the present time, the narrative 
being divided into three parte, or periods, called

York : G. P. Putnam Sons.

ning and Marion F. Lansing. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



Discovery and Exploration, the Struggle for 
Possession, and Occupation and Development. 
The writers do not pretend to have brought to 
light any strikingly new material. Their work 
is based upon the recognized authorities, — 
notably, in Part I., on Parkman and Winsor, 
and on the original narratives of Champlain, 
Hennepin, and Lahontan, of La Salle's voyages, 
of the Jesuit Relations ; and in Part II., on 
Parkman again, on Henry's Travels, the Glad- 
win Manuscripts, and various narratives of the 
War of 1812. Part III., covering the period 
of Occupation and Development, is drawn from 
a multitude of sources ; the authors have made 
very effective use of the widely scattered and 
sometimes inaccessible material of the period, 
weaving it into a connected and readable story 
of the settlement and exploitation of the region 
of the Great Lakes. It is perhaps a little to be 
regretted that they did not see fit to round out 
the story by telling us something of the explor- 
ation and development of the Canadian side of 
the lakes. The reader indeed gets the impression 
from both these books that after the close of 
the period of French rule the story of the Great 
Lakes was almost entirely a story of American 
development. One would have liked to hear 
something more, for instance, of the history of 
the Northwest Company, whose fur-trading 
operations had so intimate a bearing on the story 
of the Great Lakes ; of their vessels that plied on 
Lakes Huron and Superior ; and of the canal 
that the Company built at the Sault. One is 
struck, too, by the absence from the otherwise 
excellent List of Books, at the end of the " Story 
of the Great Lakes," of any Canadian work, 
with the single exception of Professor Colby's 
" Canadian Types of the Old Regime." Not a 
single Canadian work is cited, for instance, on 
such a controversial topic as the War of 1812. 
However, these are but trifling omissions in 
what is in other respects a fair-minded, well- 
balanced, and decidedly readable history of the 
Great Lakes. 

Mr. Curwood's book is conceived upon a 
somewhat original plan. It is divided into two 
unequal parte, the first and larger of which, is 
devoted to the Great Lakes as they are to-day, 
and particularly to their vast shipping industry 
and how it was developed. In the second part, 
a brief account is given of the origin and history 
of the lakes, from prehistoric times to the War 
of 1812 or thereabouts. This supplementary 
portion compares rather unfavorably with Pro- 
fessor Channing's book, which is more accurate 
and better balanced. It might have been wiser

[July 16, 



if Mr. Curwood had confined himself to the 
modern story of the lakes ; for here he leaves 
little to be desired. As an industrial history 
of the Great Lakes, his book stands by itself. 
Most of us had a general idea of the character 
of the shipping industry of these great inland 
seas, but Mr. Curwood's book is a revelation as 
to its magnitude and significance. He manages 
to crowd into his pages a wealth of detail which 
gives practical value to the narrative without 
detracting from its interest to the general reader ; 
and the attractiveness of the book is further en- 
hanced by numerous full-page illustrations.

Recent Fiction.* 



Having made a brief visit to America, Mrs. 
Humphry Ward seems to have felt that it devolved 
upon her to write a novel with an American setting. 
But we cannot consider " Marriage a la Mode " to 
be one of her successful efforts. It is hardly more 
than a sketch in dimensions, and bears many evi- 
dences of flagging powers and hasty composition. 
"We look to it in vain for those qualities of delicate 
characterization and subtle analysis that we have 
come to expect from her, nor do we find the finished 
texture of her better and earlier work. There are 
curious infelicities of phrasing, as in the case of the 
woman whose mourning for her lost charms is 
described by saying that " she had never yet recon- 
ciled herself to physical losses which were but the 
outward and visible sign of losses ' far more deeply 
interfused.' " There are reckless statements, such as 
that which attributes the fortunes of the heroine's 
father to his having u ravaged and destroyed great 
tracts of primeval forest in the northern regions of 
his adopted state," which state happens to have been 
Illinois ! As for the heroine herself, who is chosen

Irish blood, and is in no wise characteristically 
American, except in a superficial way. Mrs. Ward's 
main purpose is to set forth the evils of American 
divorce, but her horrible example is one that 
Americans cannot take seriously. Even the English- 
man who serves as the hero (for the whole compli- 
cation is brought about by an international marriage) 
is so poor a creature that it seems fairly natural that 
he should go to the dogs when his wife forsakes him, 
and we find it difficult to take much sympathetic 
interest in a man so devoid of stamina. The con- 
trast between what the author might have made of 
her theme and what she has made of it occasions 
melancholy reflections. We can only hope that this 
ill-digested production does not mark the permanent 
decline of her powers. 

When Dick Sugden, a young American in London, 
falls in love with Daphne Medlycott, his slender for- 
tunes preclude the carrying of his romance to its 
logical conclusion. But when he returns to England, 
ten years later, the owner of fabulous mines and 
other desirable properties, the case is different, and 
he is contentedly accepted by Daphne and Daphne's 
family. At this point Miss Macvane's story of " The 
Black Flier " begins. The hour of the wedding is 
at hand, and the guests are assembled, when it is 
discovered that the license has confused the names 
of the contracting parties, and must be corrected. 
Dick, arrayed in his wedding garments, hastily cuts 
across country on his way to the nearest town, con- 
fronts a hedge, recklessly jumps over it, and lands 
sprawling in the road, sprained and helpless. A 
solitary lady driving a motor-car comes along at a 
furious speed, stops long enough to help Dick into 
the tonneau, and speeds away with him to the north. 
Heedless of his request to be set down in the town 
for which he had been making, she puts on speed, 
and does not stop until they reach a secluded hostelry 
at Muckledean, over the Scottish border. Here cir- 
cumstances conspire to make them appear man and 
wife, and all novel-readers know what that means — 
in the sight of the ancient law of Scotland. Thus is 
created a complication so extraordinary that when 
Dick at last gets back to his betrothed, he has to 
invent as plausible an account as possible of his 
disappearance, for the simple reason that telling the 
exact truth would fix upon him the character of a 
modern Munchausen. Nobody would believe so wild 
a yarn as that, and he must substitute a story that 
sounds halfway credible. But when the matter is 
smoothed over, and a second date set for the wed- 
ding, his troubles have only begun, for he gets legal 
advice to the effect that the unknown companion of 
his wild northward ride is undoubtedly his lawful 
wife. He is also pursued by a detective on the charge 
of having stolen the motor-car. Presently the com- 
panion of his escapade turns up, and is no other than 
the wife of the dissipated baronet who happens to be 
the head of the family into which Dick is about to 
marry. This frees him from the fear of becoming 
a bigamist, but by no means restores Dick's peace of

mind ; for the wife, who had been fleeing from her 
husband, has been captured by him, and the baronet 
vows bloody Tengeance upon her companion, as soon 
as his identity shall be discovered. Daphne mean- 
while wearies of excitement, uncertainty, and suspi- 
cion, and, instead of marrying Dick, is wedded to the 
faithful curate. Since she is a woman of the u icily 
regular, splendidly null " type of beauty and char- 
acter, we are rather relieved — and so, to his own 
naive surprise, is Dick, whose thoughts have all the 
time been most unbecomingly haunted by the per- 
sonality of the woman who had led him into his great 
adventure. Nothing is now left but for the baronet 
to die; and with that happy despatch we reach the 
end of one of the most fascinatingly ingenious com- 
edies that we have encountered in the fiction of re- 
cent years. 

Mr. Stanley Weyman declares that he will write 
no more novels — which is rather a pity, for his in- 
vention show few signs of flagging, and " The Wild 
Geese " is one of the best stories he has ever given 
us. The scene is Ireland in the early eighteenth 
century : the heroine is the high-spirited chatelaine 
of a decaying house, and the hero is a middle-aged 
soldier of fortune, her kinsman whom she has not 
seen for a score of years, and who appears in the 
character of her legally constituted guardian. A 
Protestant and a supporter of the House of Hanover, 
the visitor is anything but welcome, for the country- 
side is seething with rebellion, and a rising is immi- 
nent. Suspicion turns to hatred and violence when 
the newcomer is found taking active steps to thwart 
the conspirators, and the savage clansmen more than 
once nearly compass his destruction. He is by no 
means a hero of the swashbuckling variety, but a 
grave and seasoned warrior, cautious but determined, 
a composite of Roundhead and Quaker, and he main- 
tains so imperturbable a front in the face of danger 
that his hot-blooded foes hesitate long before ventur- 
ing to attack him. Most violent of all in her hatred 
is his fair cousin and ward, whose emotions are deeply 
stirred by what she takes to be the cause of faith and 
patriotism. We know well enough that she will suc- 
cumb in the end, and she makes a most engaging fury 
before she is tamed. There is real power in this 
book, the power of vital characterization and vivid 
description, the power to make us realize a picturesque 
historical situation. The author really must change 
his mind about further writing ; he is too serious a 
novelist to be spared. 

Mr. Percy Brebner's "A Royal Ward" is a 
straightforward story of a rather old-fashioned sort, 
without psychological subtleties or perplexing mys- 
teries, which keeps a surprisingly firm hold upon the 
reader's interest. It is a story of England during 
the Regency, and its hero is a Frenchman who lands 
in secret upon the Devon coast, is reputed to be a 
Bonapartist spy and is pursued as such, but in realitv 
comes upon a private mission. He makes the acquaint- 
ance of the heroine at an early stage of the history, 
for he takes refuge in her home, and is concealed by 
her from his would-be captors. Having thus saved 



him, her interest in his personality is naturally en- 
listed, and the way is thus paved for a pretty romance. 
Presendy the scene shifts to London, where Ladv 
Betty becomes the idol of the fashionable world, 
while Victor Dubuisson finds himself, innocently 
enough, entangled in a plot to assassinate the Prince 
Regent. From the perils that beset them both (for 
Lady Betty is in danger of being forced into a dis- 
tasteful marriage) the lovers finally make a wild flight 
to the coast and escape to France, where their 
troubles end. 

The multiplication of toy monarchies, and their 
imaginary projection into out-of-the-way nooks in the 
map of Europe, goes merrily on. We have had at 
least a score of them during the past twenty years, 
and their combined area, were they really existent, 
would leave little room for the great powers. The 
latest of them, invented by Mr. Anthony Partridge, 
is named Yaria. and its political drama is presented 
in an ingenious work of fiction entitled u The King- 
dom of Earth." The king is an old reprobate, sup- 
porting a dissolute life by the exorbitant taxation of 
his people, and the crown prince is reputed to be even 
worse than the ruler. But thereby hangs a tale. For 
this same prince, sedulously fostering for his own 
secret ends the legend which holds him to be a notori- 
ous evil-liver, is in reality a pattern of austere virtue, 
and a republican at heart. Posing to the world 
(through the agency of a double) as a sensualist and 
a debauchee, he is all the time plotting with a revolu- 
tionary band to overthrow the monarchy, intending 
himself to renounce his claim to the succession. The 
young woman in the case is half English, half Varian, 
and, although she is not let into his secret until near 
the exciting close of the story, believes in him despite 
all scandalous report. Adventures follow thick and 
fast as the plot developes, and the hero shows him- 
self a very marvel of resource and intrepidity, playing 
his dangerous game to the end, and coming out com- 
paratively unscathed. When the curtain falls upon 
the drama, he has become plain John Peters, and 
there is a Mrs. John Peters to make up to him for 
the loss of a kingdom. 

Mr. H. C. Chatfield-Taylor has devoted many 
years to the study of Moliere, and has given us the 
best biography of the dramatist to be had in the 
English language. u Fame's Pathway," which takes 
the form of a historical novel, is a sort of by-product 
of the author's more serious labors, and supplements 
them in a happily fanciful way. The limitations of 
the novelist who takes for Ids herb a figure from 
actual history are manv. and it is difficult to reconcfle 
the claims of truth with those of literary art : while 
of all varieties of the biographical novel, that which 
is concerned with the man of letters is the most for- 
bidding. Considering the obstacles he has had to 
contend with, Mr. Chatfield-Taylor has achieved a 
more than creditable measure of success in picturing 
the life and fortunes of the young Moliere, and 
reproducing the atmosphere of the period in which 
he struggled. Few writers of historical fiction have 
the equipment which the present writer brings to his

task, or can give their work reality by so great a 
store of verifiable detail. Faithfulness rather than 
imaginative daring characterizes the book viewed in 
this aspect. In its other aspect — that in which the 
early stirrings of genius are sought to be realized — 
the book is cautious, and a little too much senti- 
mentalized. Its hero is an engaging youth, his sur- 
roundings are picturesque, and the story of his love 
for Madeleine Be*jart is pleasantly told. If his name 
were not Moliere, we should hardly suspect that he 
was destined — that he was well on the way — to 
become one of the wisest souls and one of the pro- 
f oundest searchers of the human heart that have ever 
observed the tragi-comedy of life. But it is not fair 
to exact the impossible of any writer, and one can 
hardly be blamed for failing to find new words fit to 
be uttered by a Moliere. Mr. Chatfield-Taylor makes 
no such pretension ; he takes for granted that even 
a great genius is not always upon stilts, particularly 
in his formative period, and that in daily intercourse 
with his associates he may appear very much in the 
guise of the ordinary mortal. We are even inclined 
to think that he was ill-advised in adding "The 
Romance of a Genius " as a sub-title to his novel ; 
the fact that Moliere was a genius is sure to be in 
the background of the reader's consciousness, but the 
author could not have been expected to do more than 
see to it that his characterization was not inconsistent 
with that fact. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis again finds his account 
in a South American revolution, and his story called 
" The White Mice " seems likely to endear him still 
further to his juvenile audience. To any following 
more critical he can hardly expect to appeal, for the 
book is too absurdly lacking in all the qualities that 
belong to serious fiction. It is just a breezy tale of 
a Venezuelan ruction, having for its hero an ingenu- 
ous youth, the son of an American " king of finance," 
and for its heroine the daughter of a deposed and 
imprisoned Venezuelan President. The problem is 
to get the prisoner out of his dungeon, and claim the 
daughter as a reward. It is all delightfully simple, 
and the mechanism of counterplot is not enough over- 
worked to give us any anxiety concerning the out- 
come. The tale is breezy, " smart," topical, and 
enlivened by slangy humor. It may be read at a 
gallop, and put aside without a pang. 

The rubber plantation in Mexico has been used 
for many years to defraud the gullible portion of the 
American public; it is now put for the first time 
perhaps to an honest use by Mr. Herman Whitaker, 
who has made it the theme of an exceptionally inter- 
esting novel. Not only does " The Planter " expose 
the unconscionable methods of the promoter of this 
species of enterprise, but it also throws a light upon 
the conditions of labor in semi-tropical America, 
revealing a degree of brutality in the treatment of 
the hapless native bondmen that recalls the most 
sensational descriptions of Southern plantation life 
in our own dark ages of slavery. An honest New 
England youth is sent down to Mexico as manager 
of one of these " fake " plantations, and discovers a 



condition of affairs considerably different from that 
pictured in the prospectus of the company. He sets 
about the task of bringing order into the neglected 
enterprise with unexpected energy and ability, and 
at the same time imparts an element of humanity 
into the treatment of the native laborers. But this 
is not the way in which he is expected to u make 
good " by the company at home, and when they learn 
of his pernicious activities they plan to oust him, 
and vest control of the plantation in the most brutal 
of the local slave-drivers. A hurried journey home 
thwarts this conspiracy, exposes the swindling opera- 
tions of the company, and results in the manager's 
return to Mexico with enlarged powers. This is the 
skeleton of the plot ; the romance is provided by a 
beautiful Mexican girl whom the hero loves and wins 
after overcoming the usual variety of obstacles. As 
a vivid presentation of scenes and characters com- 
paratively unexploited, this novel makes a strong 
appeal to the jaded sense, and may be recommended 
as a picturesque and intelligent piece of work. 

Mr. Oliver Cabot is the author of "The Man 
without a Shadow " — a title not to be taken in the 
Peter Schlemihl sense, but symbolically, as meaning 
one who has lost all memory of his past. The story 
is told in the first person, and we make the hero's 
acquaintance in a private asylum for the insane at 
the moment when he first comes to consciousness 
after a period of torpor. His memory is a blank, 
but his faculties are otherwise restored, and he soon 
discovers the nature of the establishment in which 
he is living, and shrewdly surmises that he is de- 
tained from sinister motives. His awakened intelli- 
gence enables him to plan an escape, which is 
successfully accomplished. But his plight is still 
serious, for, although free, he is penniless, knows not 
whither to turn for aid, and has not the slightest 
clue to his own identity. Such a situation clearly 
calls for much ingenuity on the part of the writer, 
who contrives to keep us interested in his hero 
through a long series of happenings, which finally 
land him in a French chateau, with wife and fortune 
restored, and a patched-up memory. This story 
may be regarded as a faint reflection of " Somehow 
Good," and, although it offers not a tithe of the art 
or the psychology of Mr. De Morgan's novel, may 
yet be recognized as an entertaining production. 

"The Chrysalis," by Mr. Harold Morton Kramer, 
is a story that begins upon the football field at 
New Haven, and ends in the far Northwest. Polit- 
ical and financial intrigue form the substance of the 
narrative, and, together with a certain admixture 
of physical violence, gives it virility. On the senti- 
mental side, it provides two heroines, the second and 
prevailing one being " sprung " upon us midway, in 
the person of a young woman who believes herself 
to be of Siwash blood. When it turns out that she 
is as white as the hero, his scruples vanish, and he 
takes her to his heart. The book is embellished 
with much Chinook jargon, for which a glossary has 
to be furnished. It is called " The Chrysalis " be- 
cause it describes the awakening of moral character

in the hero, whose earlier life has been based strictly 
upon self-seeking and vindictive motives. 

In " The Making of Bobby Burnit," Mr. George 
Randolph Chester tells us how an ingenious youth, 
thrown upon his own resources as far as initia- 
tive is concerned, exchanges the world of clubdom 
and sport for the world of business, is enabled by 
the failure of various enterprises to sharpen his eye- 
teeth, and eventually makes for himself a successful 
career. Bobby is the son of a millionaire who dies, 
and expresses in his will the conviction that his son 
is a fool. The estate is left in a secret trust, except 
for the large merchant establishment which the 
senior Burnit has built up, and this is left outright 
to the boy, who is to carry it on. He is soon tricked 
into forming a stock company with a rival establish- 
ment, and finds himself frozen out by his designing 
new associate. All this has been accurately foreseen 
by the father, who has left a series of sealed envel- 
opes addressed to his son, which are delivered one 
by one in the crises that call for them. An early 
number in the series is inscribed " To My Son, upon 
the Occasion of His Completing a Consolidation 
with Silas Trimmer," and reads : " When a man 
devils you for years to enter a business deal with 
him, you may rest assured that man has more to gain 
by it than you have. Aside from his wormwood 
business jealousy of me, Silas Trimmer has wanted 
this Grand Street entrance to his store for more than 
a third of a century ; now he has it. He '11 have 
your store next." Bobby is a sadder and a wiser 
youth when he reads this letter, for its prediction 
has already been fulfilled. The terms of the trust 
release for his use successive instalments of his in- 
heritance, and each time a new venture is under- 
taken, quickly ending in disaster. And with each 
disaster, one of the envelopes is produced, making 
sardonic comment upon the latest lesson of experi- 
ence. Bobby gradually learns that business people 
are not " sportsmanlike " in their dealings, which is 
a great grief to him, but the knowledge in time fits 
him to meet them on their own ground. He suc- 
cessively finances a land improvement scheme, an 
electric lighting corporation, a stranded Italian opera 
company, and a moribund newspaper. With the 
lastrnamed enterprise the tide turns, he becomes a 
forceful influence in civic affairs, boldly attacks the 
boss and the gang, and after a hard struggle, has 
the whole panic-stricken pack on the run. Success 
has come to him at last, and then, in the manner of 
the 'most approved fairy tale, the disastrous earlier 
ventures develope new signs of promise, and he finds 
himself a winner all along the line. He opens the 
last of his father's envelopes, and reads : M I knew 
you 'd do it. dear boy. Whatever mystery I find in 
the great hereafter I shall be satisfied — for I knew 
you 'd do it." There is a slender thread of love- 
story running through this entertaining yarn, but 
it adds practically nothing to the interest, which 
is wholly centred upon Bobby's successive eye- 
openings and their salutary contribution to his 
development. William Morton Patxe.

The conservation Whether Mr. Mathews's " Remaking 
TourlnlZZr 1 ? the Mississippi " (Houghton) owes 
water-courMet. its inception to recently stimulated 
public interest in the conservation of our inland 
waterways, we are not informed ; but in any event 
the book is one which ought to appeal to a wide con- 
stituency. The task which the author has undertaken 
is to describe the efforts that have been made during 
the past hundred years to subdue for the better use 
of mankind the vast network of rivers comprising the 
Mississippi system. The idea underlying the work 
is that the great Middle West is approaching a day 
when congestion of traffic will compel a widespread 
return to the use of waterways, and that therefore 
the further improvement of these invaluable natural 
facilities is a matter of supreme importance to all 
sections of the country. Dividing the Mississippi 
system into six parts — the main river below St. 
Louis, the Ohio, the Chicago-Illinois route to the 
Lakes, the Upper Mississippi, the Missouri, and the 
minor tributaries — Mr. Mathews discusses with con- 
siderable fulness the physiographic character of each 
water-course, the steps that have thus far been taken 
to facilitate navigation, and the problems involved 
in the future of the Middle Western waterways in 
general. He writes as a journalist rather than as an 
engineer, and the result is an exceedingly readable 
treatise on a subject about which the majority of 
our people know altogether too little. The national 
government, the author, says, has expended on the 
Mississippi and its branches between two hundred 
and two hundred and fifty millions of dollars, of which 
much has been consumed in experimentation and 
much has been wasted, but a great deal remains in 
permanently improved channels and in public works 
ample for their task for a century. Just what has 
been done with all this money (and the additional 
sums expended by the States and by private enter- 
prise), and how the work has been done, is adequately 
presented ; and not the least valuable aspect of Mr. 
Mathews's chapters is the incidental light they throw 
upon the rather dubious river-and-harbor policy of 
the United States during the past half-century. On 
the whole, the reader is given to understand that very 
great progress has been made, though less than might 
easily have been realized with a larger measure of 
foresight and a smaller admixture of petty politics. 
With respect to what is to-day the most talked-about 
phase of the subject in the Central West, i. e., the 
Lakes-to-the-Gulf project — the author predicts that 
in the new era of waterway development, which he 
believes to be dawning, this enterprise will be one 
of the first to be carried into execution. It may, 
however, be noted in this connection that a special 
board of engineers created by act of Congress has 
recently reported that the scheme would cost 
$128,000,000, that the mere maintenance of the 
waterway would entail an expenditure of S6.000.000 
a year, and that the project is therefore too costly 
to be justified by the present needs of commerce.

Epistolary and The ^ of forcible and adequate ex- 
literary remaim pres8ion in short compass belonged 
of a noted editor. to fa e j ate Wendell Phillips Garrison, 
for forty-one years editorially connected with " The 
Nation," and during the last twenty-five of those years 
its editor. He died Feb. 27, 1907, only eight months 
after relinquishing the post he had so long and ably 
held. Most of his literary work being anonymous, 
and therefore difficult to identify in the columns of 
his paper, the volume of " Letters and Memorials " 
edited by his classmate, Mr. J. H. McDaniels, and 
published by the Houghton Mifflin Co., is welcome 
to his numerous former co-workers and admirers, 
arid deserves to be read and studied by many besides. 
A fine example of the careful scholarship that is now 
fast becoming obsolete with us, Mr. Garrison set his 
stamp on his weekly journal so deeply and inefface- 
ably that it will be long ere his dead hand ceases to 
influence its course and to uphold its ideals. The 
memorial volume contains an introduction by Mr. 
McDaniels, an unsigned outline of Mr. Garrison's 
life, a hundred pages or more of his letters, chiefly 
to contributors, a chapter on the fortieth anniversary 
of " The Nation," a brief selection from Mr. Garri- 
son's poems, and nearly a hundred pages of prose 
miscellanies from his pen. A clear and pleasing 
portrait of the editor, from a photograph taken in 
1894, forms the frontispiece. The most intimately 
personal parts of the book, and hence the most inter- 
esting, are the letters. These are written in an off- 
hand, unstudied way, which reveals much of the 
character of the man and # of his mental attitude 
toward his own offices and convictions, as well as 
toward those of other people. Mr. Garrison was of 
course a born reformer, and his patience with oppo- 
sition could hardly be called angelic. A significant 
expression occurs in one of his letters written to his 
friend Mr. William Roscoe Thayer : " I am firm in 
the faith that President Harper of Chicago must be 
put down." Putting people down was a favorite 
occupation with both Mr. Garrison and Mr. Godkin, 
and it probably lessened their influence and their 
power for good. The process is one that may be 
gratifying to the performer and amusing to the spec- 
tator, but is scarcely likely to persuade or convince 
those who are in disagreement. The really great 
leaders, like Lincoln, do not accomplish results in 
that way. The few poems of Mr. Garrison's that are 
given show strength and sincerity, with admirable 
perfection of form. Altogether the volume forms a 
worthy memorial of a distinguished and useful career. 

An illuminating Volume Four of the "French Men 
biography of of Letters Series" (Lippincott) is 
Sainte-Beuve. p ro f eS 8or George McLean Harper's 
study of Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve. It has 
the distinction of being the first book written in 
English on the life and work of the most eminent 
French literary critic, and the merit of being an 
unusually careful and scholarly bit of work. The 
biography differs from its French forbears in roundly 
denying that Sainte-Beuve had a definite theory or 



method of criticism ; which difference in attitude has 
little significance, perhaps, except to remind the 
reader that this biographer is an American and the 
others were Frenchmen. Professor Harper has a 
very comfortable habit of skilful digression to aid the 
reader's treacherous memory. Mention of the " Port- 
Royal," for instance, leads to a swift but thorough 
review of that movement ; mention of Sainte-Beuve's 
relations with Lamennais suggests a somewhat ex- 
tended biography of that half-forgotten reformer. 
There is no idealization of a very imperfect subject ; 
the critic's cowardly treatment of the Hugos, his low 
standard of private morality, his numerous shifts of 
doctrine and party, are discussed with unsparing 
frankness ; but with all restrictions, the biographer 
remains an enthusiastic admirer of his subject. 
With regard to Sainte-Beuve's frequent changes of 
front, in fact, Professor Harper finds it the most 
natural thing in the world that a critic's interest in 
the object of his study should temporarily spell 
approval. Hard and fast comparisons are dangerous 
but attractive ; and we remember and ponder such 
assertions as " Sainte-Beuve is the most serviceable 
literary critic France has known." " For scope and 
appreciation combined with minute knowledge of 
detail, neither the modern nor the ancient world 
affords an instance of a comparable talent in the 
field of criticism." " His was eminently the fullest 
mind, though perhaps not the most fertile and by no 
means the most original, in the nineteenth century." 

Uv-to-date ^ r * ^ erc Y Bordwell's " Law of War 

rules of the between Belligerents " (Callaghan & 

game of war. q q ^ Chicago) falls naturally into two 
parts — the first historical, the second in the nature 
of a commentary. Beginning with a rapid sketch of 
the rules regulating warfare in ancient and mediaeval 
times, the author traces in considerable detail the 
growth of the law and practice of belligerency from 
the days of Grotius through the Russo-Japanese con- 
flict of 1904-5. There is not much here that is new, 
but for a general survey — one that should lend itself 
with peculiar readiness to consultation by the layman 
— this portion of the monograph will be found of ser- 
vice. More important, because dealing with fresher 
material, is the commentary upon the successive 
articles of the Convention promulgated at the Second 
Peace Conference two years ago. Drawing at every 
stage upon a wealth of historical and legal reference, 
and following closely the text of the Hague Conven- 
tion, Dr. Bordwell is able to present a serwe of 
illuminating comments upon this most recent attempt 
to formulate the principles and methods of modern 
warfare. The usefulness of the book would have 
been materially enhanced by the subjoining of a 
chapter comprising an orderly summary of the 
changes introduced in current practice by the speci- 
fications of the Hague Convention. The entire 
monograph, in truth, partakes rather too much of 
the character of a note-book. Likely to be of real 
service to students of international affairs are certain 
documents appended to the text, notably the regula-

tions and instructions of the Japanese Government 
on the treatment of Russian subjects during the 
Russo-Japanese war. The bibliographical list is 
adequate. The author announces his purpose event- 
ually to complete his studies in this field by a volume 
on the laws of war as affecting neutrals, and another 
on amicable means of adjusting international dis- 
putes. 

Published for the International 
international School of Peace, and recounting in 
Law and Peace, detail the history of the most sub- 
stantial efforts made within a generation to curb 
the ravages of warfare, Professor Hull's volume on 
u The Two Hague Conferences and their Contri- 
butions to International Law " (Ginn & Co. ) has at 
once taken high rank in the rapidly accumulating 
literature of the twentieth-century peace movement. 
The author was one of several Americans present 
at The Hague in a journalistic capacity during the 
Second Peace Conference. His account of the 
Conference of 1899 is based principally upon the 
official record as published by the Minister of For- 
eign Affairs of the Netherlands. For the Confer- 
ence of 1907. the primary source is likewise the 
official record, the use of which in its unpublished 
state was extended to Dr. Hull by the same digni- 
tary. The arrangement of the book is such that the 
reader may readily follow the history and transac- 
tions of either conference alone, or he may just as 
readily cam' the two together and compare them 
point by point. The work is essentially historical, 
and the author has evaded frequent temptation to 
enter upon the field of partisan argument or theo- 
retical contention. The participation of the dele- 
gates from the United States in the transactions of 
the two conferences has been given special promi- 
nence. After a detailed narrative of the discussions 
of the rules of warfare upon land and sea, there fol- 
lows a fifty-page chapter upon the victories achieved 
in behalf of international arbitration and another of 
equal length comprising a summary of the results 
of the conferences and their historical importance. 
To the layman, at least, these are likely to prove the 
most valuable portions of the book.

thought, it is quite certain in this 
pedagogic age that much thought will continue to be 
e^rarfed upon methods of imparting and improving 
process of thinking. Dr. I. E. Miller has a 
pertinent and inviting title for his volume " The 
Psychology of Thinking" (Macmillan); and his 
treatment, though germane and adequate to his 
purpose, yet in no marked degree rises above the 
conventional and uninspiring presentation of a topic 
of vital interest. The book is, however, a text, 
and persistently holds to the impression of the stu- 
dent with the data and the procedure of the useful 
thought processes. It tells him what functional 
value thinking has in the organic scheme ; what its 
connections are with the nervous substrata ; what its

dependence upon the sensory stream of experience 
and upon the motor channels of expression ; it fol- 
lows the elaboration of the simpler experiences into 
the more involved perceptive and imaginative and 
conceptual fields ; and it relates the process to the 
logical standards of the product in sound reasoning. 
It sets the whole presentation in an educational 
frame, and leaves a picture instructive for those 
on instruction bent, but hardly attractive to those 
whose reactions demand a more intrinsically artistic 
mode of appeal. For sound thought and the psy- 
chology thereof, like virtue, must be made attractive; 
and the field is open to the psychological craftsman 
who can make of the analysis of the thinking pro- 
cesses an impressive literary and yet realistic canvas. 

Despite the ever-increasing number 
of books on musical topics written 
for the amateur, the popular demand 
shows no sign of diminution. In the nature of the 
case, these books are for the most part merely re- 
statements in simplified and abbreviated form of 
what has already been said in more abstruse and 
elaborated way by those writing technically on the 
subject. They show little or no originality of thought ; 
their manner of treatment is all-important. Yet 
they fill the important role of intermediary between 
the more scientific writers and the public at large, 
interpreting and elucidating in untechnical language 
matters difficult of comprehension to the layman. 
In this class of books is Mr. Daniel Gregory Mason's 
" The Orchestral Instruments and What They Do " 
(Baker-Taylor Co.). The book is a popular conden- 
sation of the contents of various scientific treatises 
on orchestration, of which those by Berlioz and 
Gavaert are the most important. The descriptions 
of the various instruments of the orchestra are rein- 
j forced by photographs of them as played, as well as 
by brief illustrations from well-known scores showing 
how the various composers have employed the sev- 
eral voices of the orchestra ; and the attentive reader 
may gain a fair idea of the particular problem which 
the composer of orchestral music has before him. 
The author has been fairly successful in accomplish- 
ing what he set out to do, and the entire field of 
instrumentation is covered in the hundred odd pages 
of the book.

nature ; about all that can reasonably be expected is 
an interesting re-statement of the facts and opinions 
that are already pretty well admitted. Mr. H. E. 
Butler has furnished an excellent introduction to 
post-Augustan poetry in a work lately issued from 
the Oxford University Press, which will be of ser- 
vice not only to the Latin specialist but also to the 
student and critic of any literature. The decline in 
quality with a corresponding increase in quantity of 
literary production after a period of great work is 
well illustrated in the work of the epic poets after 
Vergil, such as Lucan, Valerius, Flaocus, Statius,

and Silius Italicus. The tendency to satire after 
an outburst of high poetic creativeness is shown in 
the work of Persius, Martial, and Juvenal, just as it 
was in our own eighteenth century. Finally, the 
bombast of the worn-out drama, which marks the 
late post-Shakespeareans, is witnessed also in the case 
of Seneca. The place which these authors hold in 
their own period, as well as their absolute merit, is 
admirably brought out by Mr. Butler by means of 
copious illustrations in both the original Latin and 
in excellent translations. No attempt is made to 
glorify these poets unduly ; their faults are indicated 
clearly enough, but a generous endeavor is made to 
save them from an undeserved neglect. 

Under the startling caption, " Are 
the Dead Alive ? " (B. W. Dodge) 
Mr. Fremont Rider attempts to startle 
the public once more into an intent excitement over 
the alleged discoveries of mediums and their ex- 
ploiters concerning the evidence obtainable by their 
peculiar methods, to uphold a belief in bodily sur- 
vival. To this is attached the opinion, sometimes 
with reservations and more often without, of a few 
men whom the world honors for what they have done 
and cherishes for the qualities which they do not 
exhibit in this aspect of their activities. Then there 
is accumulated the voluminous evidence of the pro- 
fessional psychic researcher ; and, finally, the over- 
whelming realism of bad photographs. If anyone 
is inclined to be influenced by this type of presenta- 
tion, an ounce is as good as a ton. To the other 
type of mind, the ton is equally unconvincing. Yet 
if one wants to know what the character of the ore 
is that some look upon as gold and others as dross, 
this book furnishes a convenient sample of the mine. 
But it must be remarked that mining investments 
heralded in these terms have usually been greeted 
with a certain mistrust by the unconfiding public. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Dr. William Bradley Otis's " American Verse, 1625- 
1807," published by Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co., deals 
with a rather neglected region of our literature in per- 
haps as interesting a fashion as the sterility of the soil 
permits. Historical, religious, political and satirical, 
imaginative and translated verse are the five types 
described in as many chapters, and an excellent bibliog- 
raphy gives added value to the work. 

Professor James A. James and Albert H. Sanford, 
already the joint authors of two excellent text-books of 
civil government, have now prepared an " American 
History " for the use of secondary schools, and the work 
is published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. It 
follows the usual plan of such books, with somewhat less 
than the share of attention generally given to the 
periods of exploration and colonization, the space thus 
saved making possible a fuller treatment of the national 
phase of our history. The illustrations, and the various 
helps provided for teachers and students, combine with 
the text to make this book one of the most satisfactory 
now available. 



« The Mental Man," by Mr. Gustav Gottlieb Wenzloff, 
is a text-book of psychology in outline, published by the 
Charles E. Merrill Co. It is not the sort of laboratory 
manual that sometimes masquerades as a treatise upon 
the psychic life, although it recognizes adequately the 
results of laboratory investigation. It is lucid in exposi- 
tion, but does not forget, in the author's words, that 
"psychology is not for babes," a precept that some 
educators would do well to take to heart. 

" The Fate of Iciodorum," by Dr. David Starr Jordan 
(Holt), is a pungent satire upon the humbug of protection 
to national industries by means of the tariff. The book 
is expanded from a sketch called "The Octroi at Issoire," 
written a quarter of a century ago, and points its moral 
most effectively. But the shaft of no satire, we fear, 
can pierce the pachydermatous hides of our national 
legislators, whose swinish behavior during the last three 
months has been, if possible, more disgusting than in any 
previous raid upon the trough. 

The Rev. Richard Henry Edwards, of Madison, 
Wisconsin, is engaged in the publication of a series of 
pamphlets on the social problems which occupy the 
American People. These embrace the Liquor problem, 
the Negro problem, Immigration, the Labor problem, 
Poverty, Excessive and Concentrated Wealth, Divorce 
problems, the problem of Clean Municipal Govern- 
ment, the Boy problem, Licrease in Crime, the Admin- 
istration of Criminal Justice, and the Treatment of the 
Criminal. The first four of these pamphlets, varying 
from 30 to 48 pages, have already appeared. In addi- 
tion to a statement of the ruling purpose of the series, 
each pamphlet contains a brief rendering of the most 
important facts associated with the topic under consid- 
eration, and successfully enforces the subject on the 
attention of the reader. This is followed by a full bib- 
liography, which puts the problem in the hands of the 
diligent student. Judging from the work before us, 
Mr. Edwards is well fitted for the task he has set him- 
self. The pamphlets may be had at a nominal price by 
addressing Mr. Edwards, at Madison, Wis. 



Notes. 



" Tales of the Caliphs," edited by Mr. Claud Field, 
and published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., is a vol- 
ume mostly made up of sketches by the Arab historian 
Masoudi. It is published in the " Romance of the 
East " series. 

Professor William B. Cairns has edited for the Mac- 
millan Co. a volume of "Selections from Early American 
Writers, 1607-1800," which provides a large amount 
of interesting material for students of our literature i» 
its uncouth beginnings. -»--' ^ 

"Selected Poems of Matthew Arnold," rtited by 
Messrs. Hereford B. George and A. M. Leigh, and 
Pope's " Rape of the Lock," edited by Mr. George 
Holden, are two neat volumes of English texts for 
school use, published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

" The History of Cumulative Voting and Minority 
Representation in Illinois, 1870-1898," by Mr. Blaine 
F. Moore, is a recent issue of the Bulletin of the Uni- 
versity of Illinois. It is, in essence, a justification of 
the system which Illinois has now tested by the expe- 
rience of nearly forty years, occupying during all that 
period ground in advance of the other states. It is a 
I timely work, for just now politicians are aiming at the

overthrow of this principle in Illinois, and it is gratifying 
to be shown how well it has worked, how few have been 
the cases in which its purpose has been defeated. 

" Education," by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and " Edu- 
cation for Efficiency," by Dr. Charles W. Eliot, are 
given us by the Houghton Mifflin Co. as the opening 
numbers of their series of booklets styled " Riverside 
Educational Monographs," edited by Professor Henry 
Suzzallo. 

"The Poe'sies Diverses of Antoine Furetiere," re- 
printed (in part) from the edition of 1664, and edited 
bv Miss Isabelle Bronk, restores to modern readers a 
neglected poet who was at outs with the Academy, and 
consequently robbed of the consideration which was his 
due. The J. H. Furst Co., Baltimore, publish this 
volume. 

" Crowell's Modern Language Series " is now inau- 
gurated by the publication of four little books : " First 
Lessons in French," by MM. P. Banderet and P. Rein- 
hard ; " Easy German Stories," by Frau Hedwig Levi, 
edited by Mrs. Luise Uelp; " Deutsche Gedichte znm 
Auswendiglernen," edited by Dr. W. F. Chalmers; and 
" Das Rothkappchen," a five-act playlet by Miss M. 
Reiehenbach. • 

We are glad to note that Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee, a 
not infrequent contributor to The Dial, and autbor of 
■ The Search for the Western Sea " (reviewed in our 
preceding issue), has received the honor of election to 
a Fellowship in the Royal Geographical Society. Mr. 
Burpee is Librarian of the Ottawa Public Library in 
Canada, where he edits several western journals for the 
Royal Society, as well as the important Canadian 
Archives. 

" An Introduction to Poetry," by Professor Raymond 
M. Alden, is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It 
is more of a treatise than the aathor's earlier " English 
Verse," and includes a discussion of the imaginative and 
spiritual aspects of poetry. The book seems to us a 
sound and useful discussion of a subject of which the 
teaching in our schools and colleges now leaves much to 
be desired. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have just published the 
following modern language text-books: " Beginning 
German " (second edition), by Professor H. C. Bier- 
wirth; "Syntax of the French Verb," by Mr. Edward 
C. Armstrong; " Das Habichtsfraulein," by Rudolf 
Banmbach, edited by Dr. Morton C. Stewart; Hugo's 
" Ruy Bias," edited by Dr. Kenneth McKenzie; and 
three tragedies of Racine — " Athalie," " Andromaqne," 
and " Britannicus " — all edited by Professor F. M. 
Warren. 

Two new volumes in the " Wisdom of the East " 
series (Dutton) give us " The Splendour of God," being 
extracts from the sacred writings of the Bahais, edited 
Mr. Eric Hammond ; and " A Lute of Jade," being 
selections from the classical poets of China, 
lr. L. Cranmer-Byng. The same publishers 
send us three small books of "The World's Story 
Tellers": "Stories by Chateaubriand," "Stories by 
Honore' de Balzac," and " Stories by the Essayists," all 
three edited by Mr. Arthur Ransome. " Le Dernier 
Abencerrage " and " Atala " are the Chateaubriand 
examples; Balzac is represented by five choice speci- 
mens; the essayists are all English, and are eight in 
number (counting Steele and Addison as one), from 
Overbury to De Quincey. If their writings here given 
are not strictly stories, they are at least the best of 
literature.

THESE NEW BOOKS, SELECTED BY ALL WELL-EQUIPPED LIBRARIES, 
WILL BE OF UNQUESTIONED VALUE IN YOUR HOME. 



PHILOSOPHIES 

ANCIENT AND MODERN — FROM PYTHAGORAS TO SPENCER 

A series of philosophy primers, presenting in hrief but comprehensive and trustworthy form the leading features of 
the principal philosophical systems and schools, from the Early Greeks to Herbert Spencer. They will be invaluable to 
all students or serious readers who have not the leisure or the facilities for a thorough study of the subject, but who wish 
to acquaint themselves with what has been thought and taught by the scholars and teachers of ancient and modern times 

AUTHORITY 

Each of the primers is written by an unquestioned authority upon the special school or period treated of. The 
statements, whether of names and dates, or of teachings and tendencies, may therefore be relied upon as the best 
attainable information on each subject. 

J FORM 

The form of this series is similar to that of the previous series of " Religions : Ancient and Modern." There are now 
issued nine volumes, of a very convenient size, 5x7 inches, bound in dark red cloth, and tastefully stamped in gold. Each 
subject makes a brochure of about one hundred pages, and at the end of each volume the principal dates and authorities 
cited or referred to are grouped in a convenient table. 

THE VOLUMES NOW READY ARE : 

EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHY. By A. W. Benn. authorof 
" The Philosophy of Greece, Rationalism in the Nineteenth 
Century." 

STO I CI S M . By Professor St. George Stock, author of " Deduc- 
tive Logic," editor of the " Apology of Plato," etc. 

PLATO. By Professor A. E. Taylor, St. Andrew's Uuivemty, 
author of " The Problem of Conduct." 

SCHOLASTICISM. By Father Rickaby, S.J. 



HOBBES. By Professor A. E. Taylor. 

LOCKE. By Professor Alexander, M.A., LL.D., Victoria Uni- 
versity, Manchester, author of " Moral Order and Progress."

Introduction to Spencer's Philosophy." 

BER KELEY. By Professor Campbell Fraser, D.C.L.. LL.D. 

We strongly recommend this series to libraries and literary associations as convenient books of reference, which will 
not discourage the student by their size or bulk, and yet will furnish him with data sufficient for an intelligent acquaintance 
with each subject. PRICE, CLOTH, PER VOLUME, 50 CENTS NET. 



A TREASURY OF ENGLISH 
LITERATURE 

Selected and edited by KATE M. WARREN, Lecturer in 
English at the University of London. With an Introduc- 
tion by STOPFORD A. BROOKE. 

PURPOSE AND AIM. — This book presents a complete 
series of illustrations, in prose and verse, of the course of 
English Literature from the earliest times to the eighteenth 
century. It is not only a most valuable companion volume to 
such well-known anthologies as Stopford Brooke's " Primer of 
English Literature," but ia a work complete in itself, and will 
supply the need of those unable to study the subject in the 
original and complete works. It enables the student to form 
his opinions and reach his conclusions at first hand, instead of 
taking them second-hand and ready-made from any history of 
literature. It cannot fail to be of great value in the teaching of 
the subject, as well as in its study, and in addition will appeal 
to those who are neither teaching nor studying it, but who love 
and follow it for its own sake. 

EXTENT AND SCOPE.— The selections begin with 
the Early English of the 7th Century, including examples of the 
earliest prose, that of King Alfred in the 9th Century, and the 
Old English Chronicles ; and the broadening course of the lit- 
erature is illustrated by selections from the writers of the suc- 
ceeding centuries, those of the Old and Middle English before 
Chaucer being especially full and interesting, Copious extracts 
are given from Mannyng, Rolle of Hampole, Langland, Wyclif, 
and Gower. The Elizabethan period, and that from Bacon to 
Milton, are fully represented, as are the Age of Dryden and 
of Pope. The last period covers the writers from the time of 
Johnson to that of Burns. 

METHOD AND AR RANGEM ENT. -The passages 
selected are interesting in their subject-matter and literary 
relationships, as well as representative of the author and the 
period. Translations and glossaries accompany the Early 
English selections, at the foot of each page. The arrangement 
is necessarily chronological, but the selections are characteristi- 
cally grouped as far as possible.

PAGES, CLOTH, GILT TOP, $2.00 NET. 



A COMPLETE GUIDE TO 
HERALDRY 

By A. C. FOX-DAVIES, of Lincoln's Inn. Barrister-at-law. 
Editor of "Armorial Families." Author of "The Art of 
Heraldry," etc. 
Nearly 800 designs and several plates in color specially executed 
for the present work by GRAHAM JOHNSTON. Herald 
Painter to the Lyon Court. 

The aim of the work is to give in a convenient form and at 
a price not hitherto attempted a comprehensive and accurate 
guide to the law and practice of heraldry. 

During the editorship of " Ar- 
morial Families" and kindred 
works, the author has had a prac- 
tical experience which is probably 
unrivalled in its extent, and the 
fruit of his labours are now em- 
bodied in the present volume. 

The author deals first with the 
evolution of the science of Her- 
aldry, treating this most methodi- 
cally; but the main part of the 
book will consist of a practical 
exposition of the science as prac- 
tised at the present day. Every 
part of the science and each 
"charge" will be dealt with and explained, both as to its 
meaning and the rules which govern its use. 

Grouped under each heading will be found the rules appli- 
cable thereto and explained with a fulness of knowledge which 
it is hoped will render the work a standard one in time to come. 
The ILLUSTRATIONS are entirely new, having been pre- 
pared on a uniform and exhaustive plan. They are the work of 
Mr. Graham Johnston, Herald Painter to the Lyon Court.

Its Author 

is a distinguished newspa- 
per man, an Editor on the 
staff of the American 
Magazine, widely known 
through his vigorous short 
stories, etc. 

Its Scenes 

are those of a city in the 
Middle West from the time 
of its settlement in the 
height of the "free soil" 
excitement to the present 
day. 

Its Hero 

is a dominant captain of 
industry, fighting against 
odds and under pressure of 
occurrences beyond any 
foresight, weighing private 
ethics against the " larger 
good " of organizing a great 
industry. 

Its Plot 

is so genuinely real that it 
seems to grow involuntar- 
ily from the nature of the 
characters and the condi- 
tions of the times. 

Its Interest 

is intense. The leisurely 
fidelity to life in every line 
gives even the minor char- 
acters the reality of the 
folks one knows and loves. 



Its Americanism 

is its strongest feature, its 
life. No one will deny its 
realism, the vitality of its 
men and women, the accu- 
racy of a lifetime's observa- 
tion of men and circum-

"The author tells the story with sincerity, 
justice, sympathy, and accuracy. Written 
evidently from the storehouse of personal 
experience, with such candor and truth that 
the narrative touches the tenderest mem- 
ories . . . the phases of life with the pas- 
sage of time are carefully and interestingly 
observed, and have rarely been so admir- 
ably portrayed. . . . The whole design is 
carefully, skillfully drawn . . . deftly woven 
into a fascinating romance. 

"It pulsates with humor, interest, passion- 
ate love, adventure, pathos — every page is 
woven with threads of human nature, life as 
we know it, life as it is, and above it all a 
spirit of righteousness, true piety, and heroic 
patriotism. These inspire the author's 
genius and fine literary quality, thrilling 
the reader with tenderest emotion, and hold- 
ing to the end his unflagging, absorbing 
attention." — Philadelphia Public Ledger.

TENNYSON. 



In our centenary celebration of the annus 
mirabilis which gave birth to Tennyson, Darwin, 
Gladstone, Poe, Holmes, and Lincoln, not to 
mention several other names of considerable 
importance, we pay, in unwonted measure, our 
grateful tribute to the famous dead. No other 
year in the history of the English-speaking 
peoples is comparable with the year 1809 in 
respect to the number of distinguished men 
who then opened their eyes upon a world which 
was to be made better by their existence. Nor 
can we point to any coming year in which we 
will be called upon to celebrate so important a 
centenary group. 

It would be invidious to assert, taking the 
three greatest of these names into consideration, 
that one of them counts for more than the others 
in the history of human progress. The execu- 
tive who directed to successful issue the greatest 
war in modern history, the student of nature 
who transfigured the face of science and made 
a new mould for the thoughts of men, the poet 
who achieved supreme distinction in the art of 
expression and fused in his perfect verse all the 
essential elements of the spiritual life, — each 
of the three embodies in his own sphere of ac- 
tivity the qualities that are summed up for us 
in the word greatness. Of Tennyson we simply 
say that he was the greatest English poet of his 
time, and all else is but amplification of that 
one indubitable fact. 

The present is not the best time for the full 
realization of that fact. We are at once too 
near the poet and too far away from him to 
take the most accurate measure of his stature. 
We are too far away in the sense that seventeen 
years have passed since he was a living presence 
who might any day enrich our lives with some 
new crystallization of spiritual truth, or impart 
some new prophetic vision to our eager sight. 
The awed grief which overwhelmed those of us 
who are now well past the mezzo del cammin 
when we realized that all his words had been 
spoken has had time to subside, and the reaction 
from that mood of exaltation has left us a little 
stolid, perhaps, or imperfectly appreciative of 
the debt which we acknowledged in all its mag- 
nitude when he was alive. It was possible to 



60 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



write his obituary from a full heart in 1892, 
while in the present year of grace we have 
lapsed into semi-forgetfulness of that long-spent 
emotion. As the full heart fails us, however, 
the clear mind resumes its rightful control, and 
prepares for its final judgment. But in this 
sense we are still too near the poet to judge 
him with unclouded sight, to analyze values with 
nice discrimination, to view him objectively in 
the right perspective as related to his contem- 
poraries and the period in which they lived side 
by side. In the case of Poe, whose birth-year 
was the same, but who died at the age of forty, 
we have hardly yet got the proper critical focus ; 
how much farther we must be from that end 
in the case of Tennyson, who outlived Poe by 
forty-three years, and whose productive power 
was prolonged into extremest age ! 

Living, as we do, in the period of reaction 
that almost always follows upon the death of a 
great writer, it becomes pertinent to ask how 
far the reaction has gone, and what will be the 
position of the poet when both action and re- 
action — the vital influence of his presence 
among men and the yielding to other influences 
when that presence is withdrawn — are far-off 
things, say a hundred years hence. The New 
York " Evening Post " said the other day that 
" to few who are under forty does Tennyson 
seem a real poet." The statement is a startling 
one, surely not to be accepted without examina- 
tion and qualification. But youth is terribly 
critical, and the poetry that appeals to it must 
be up to date, and in touch with the current 
idiom. It is not unnatural that a young man 
should find more poetry in Mr. Kipling than in 
Tennyson, just as he may sincerely think Steven- 
son a greater writer than Scott. Of this latter 
judgment — and the former would fit just as 
well — Professor Trent recently said : "It is 
naive because it illustrates so aptly the innocent 
and childish propensity to think that what we 
like much and know well must be great because 
it greatly impresses us. There are many reasons 
why certain modern writers should impress 
sophisticated readers more profoundly than old- 
fashioned writers of far larger calibre can 
possibly do. Unless, however, an author has 
appealed to all classes of readers through a 
fairly long period of time, it is merely a sign of 
enthusiasm, not an exercise of the judgment, to 
call him great in any absolute sense of the 
epithet." Those who make such statements 
"mistake — to paraphrase Tennyson — the thin 
murmur of their little circle for the deep-toned 
utterance of the world of men." 



But we think it likely that the youth of 
to-day do not care for Tennyson in anything 
like the degree in which the youth of the last 
generation cared for him. His phrasing is out 
of fashion, and his ideas are served up without 
the condiments demanded by a taste that has 
been vitiated by the reading of newspapers and 
popular novels. Moreover — and this is an 
important matter — the schools have taken him 
up, and the blight of the educational commen- 
tator has mildewed him. Now if there is any 
one thing of which the average boy or girl is 
more convinced than others, it is that the 
writers whose acquaintance he makes through 
the medium of a school course in " English 
literature " are outside the pale of healthy and 
rational human interests. Some tribute of 
formal respect must be paid them, in deference 
to the unaccountable prejudices of older people, 
and they may be allowed shelf-room in the 
library ; but it would be sheer hypocrisy to pre- 
tend that they were a source of pleasurable 
emotion to any person with red blood in his 
veins. 

Something like this, we imagine, is what the 
reaction amounts to in the case of Tennyson. 
He has become a " British poet," like Milton 
or another, to receive profuse lip-service, but 
otherwise to be left out of the reckoning. This 
is the treatment accorded him by the unthinking 
many ; the discerning few may still find in him 
one of the strongest spiritual forces of the 
modern world, but they find it increasingly diffi- 
cult to persuade the multitude into acceptance 
of this truth. Meanwhile, the process of critical 
reflection is slowly sifting the mass of his work, 
realizing the relative values of its several parts, 
and shaping the final verdict. In this process 
of comparative valuation, some of the work is 
gaining and the rest losing. Certain of the lyrics 
and idyls have always been seen to have a per- 
fection too patent to be gainsaid by the most 
searching criticism. But other works — notably 
the longer ones — have had their ups and downs 
in the regard of serious judges. " In Memoriam " 
holds its own, and possibly gains ; the " Idylls 
of the King " are seen to be more faulty than 
we once thought them ; the beauty and vitality 
of " Maud " are more apparent than they were 
in the early days ; the dramas, now that we 
accept them frankly — except " Becket " — as 
closet-dramas, have acquired a higher dignity ; 
the whole mass of the poet's later work is now 
felt to possess a richness and a ripeness that were 
not clearly felt while he was yet alive. These 
tentative suggestions seem to indicate, if but

roughly, the way in which sober criticism has 
dealt with the poet during the seventeen years 
since his death. 

As the poet and the age which he adorned 
recede from our view, we slowly gain that per- 
ception of their reciprocal relations from which 
the final formula of the Tennysonian equation 
will be worked out. Mr. Gosse has already re- 
minded us that for about half a century the ex- 
ample of Tennyson stiffened English poetry into 
something like immobility. Fluid during the 
romantic period of the early nineteen hundreds, 
its free movement was arrested by the domina- 
ting influence of this one poet, who created 
what seemed to be the type of supreme excel- 
lence, a form so finished that there was nothing 
for other poets to do but adopt it. Not until 
the century was nearing its decline was this 
controlling influence slackened, and the springs 
of fresh inspiration unsealed. It is a fact of 
tremendous significance that one poet should 
have had such supremacy for so long a time, 
and a fact that must loom large in the view of 
the future historian. Seeking to account for it, 
he will probably rest his case upon the union in 
Tennyson of a Virgilian perfection of style with 
a profound understanding of the human spirit 
and of the problems with which it has to grap- 
ple in an age of rapidly widening outlook, an 
age increasingly self-conscious, and bent upon 
the closest analysis of both nature and human 
existence. 

It is in about such terms as these that M. 
Faguet, in the -- Quarterly Review " sums up 
his judgment. It has often been said that 
intelligent foreign opinion is more likely than 
our own to square with what will be the opinion 
of posterity, and, with that consideration in 
view, we translate from M. Faguet as follows : 
"Tennyson represents the meeting in a single 
man of all the forms of poetry which had shone 
during the preceding generation ; he profited 
by all the varieties of imagination displayed and 
unfolded before his time, collected and unified 
them in himself, fusing them with his own per- 
sonality, and expressing them anew in a form 
strictly his own, and consequently in a perfectly 
original manner. His temperament was such 
that he could feel very deeply what his prede- 
cessors had felt ; his talent was to put these 
sentiments into new frames (fiction, re very, 
legend) ; his art was to invent rhythmical forms 
which left him in nobody's debt. ... He had 
romantic sensibility, and he expressed it with 
classical perfection." For our own part, we 
should supplement this verdict, adequate as it 



appears from the artist's point of view, by pay- 
I ing tribute to the poet's thought, which faced 
' and penetrated the darkest and thorniest hedges 
I of the mind, caught at least some glimpses of 
t the light beyond, and ripened toward the end of 

the poet's life into that " Wisdom heavenly of 

the soul " which is knowledge raised to its 

highest power.

The -scientific imagination" of Simon* Xew- 
COMB made the pursuit of astronomy and mathe- 
matics as fascinating to him, and to many of his 
readers, as a romance — if that comparison be not 
i too absurdly feeble. Compared with the stupendous 
[ mysteries of the stellar universe, what romance is 
\ worthy of a moment's wonder ? His death, July 11, 
! at the age of seventy-four, deprives the world of an 
inspired and inspiring scientist and writer. Of his 
Xova-Scotian birth, his early coming to this country,

back upon as the leading events of his life. That 
book and his novel (written somewhat in the manner 
j of Jules Verne's and Mr. H. G. Wells's pseudo- 
scientific imaginings ) entitled u His Wisdom the 
i Defender " are his chief contributions to general 
! literature, although some of his severer studies — 
i for example, his '•Popular Astronomy " and u Astron- 
omy for Everybody" — are of a nature to interest 
any intelligent reader. Political economy, sociology, 
i and finance also engaged his busy pen, and his 
researches in the construction and use of the tele- 
scope made him an authority in that department of 
applied optics. What is perhaps his most lasting 
monument is indicated in the opening sentence of 
his " Reminiscences," — '"I date my birth into the 
world of sweetness and light on one frosty morning 
in January, 1857, when I took my seat between two 
well-known mathematicians in the office of the 
• Nautical Almanac ' at Cambridge, Mass." 

The pendulum of popularity has a curious 
way of swinging backward and forward, now toward 
glory, and again about as far toward depreciation or 
even vilification. Dickens's fame, effulgent in his 
lif etime and for some years thereafter, suffered some- 
thing like eclipse for a period, but is again radiant 
as of old. Byron's vogue has had similar alterna- 
tions. Even Shakespeare suffered at the hands 
of Voltaire a scornful severity of judgment that

tended to dim his lustre in the polite world for a 
season. George Sand appears at this moment to be 
one who, after excessive adulation and almost as exces- 
sive abuse, is again enjoying the changeable world's 
favor. Zola and the realists would have it that she 
was lacking in truthfulness, others that she wanted 
originality, and the " Parnassiens " that she was 
faulty in form. Then came the reaction against this 
reaction, and critics like Taine, Brunetiere, Faguet, 
Bourget, and Lemaitre chose to speak in her praise. 
M. Rend Doumic, who may be remembered as the 
first Hyde lecturer at Harvard (1898), and who has 
recently been elected to the Academy, has issued in 
book form a series of lectures delivered last winter 
on the author of "Consuelo." One paragraph from 
his closing chapter will indicate the writer's high 
opinion of her. He says : " George Sand's vocab- 
ulary is often uncertain, her expression lacks pre- 
cision and relief ; but she has the gift of imagery, 
and her images are of an adorable freshness, be- 
cause, having always kept the rare faculty of wonder, 
she has not ceased to view things with the eyes of 
youth. She has the movement that captivates and 
the rhythm that lulls. She unrolls, with a certain 
slowness, but without embarrassment, the ample pe- 
riod characteristic of French prose at its best. It 
is impossible not to liken her to a broad river whose 
waters flow, limpid and abundant, between flowery 
banks and oases where the wayfarer loves to tarry 
and dream deliciously."

A children's library in its own building is 
probably nowhere to be seen except in Cleveland, 
where the kindly generosity of a rich man has 
helped to provide the little ones with a Day Nursery, 
a Free Kindergarten, and a Public Library. Years 
ago Joseph Perkins, of Cleveland, built and equipped 
the nursery and kindergarten, and last year a son 
gave an adjoining lot of land to the city, half of the 
lot to be used as a playground and half to be de- 
voted by the Public Library Board to the purposes 
of a children's library. The building was opened 
last September, and in its very attractive reading- 
room are to be seen shelves on all sides filled with 
books suitable for young readers and (an important 
detail) all within their reach. The purpose of the 
institution declares itself in every item of its equip- 
ment and ornamentation, and if the little ones fail 
to find happiness there they will hardly find it in 
heaven itself. But evidently they are not unappre- 
ciative. With a registered membership of six hun- 
dred and ninety, the library now circulates more 
than four thousand books a month. 



A civil-service contest for a librarianship 
is a novelty soon to be witnessed in Chicago. The 
public library board of the city has determined, 
after conference with other authorities, to throw 
open to all librarians in the country the contest for 
the very desirable position of librarian of the Chicago 



Public Library. The office is one of large possibili- 
ties for usefulness and distinguished service, and 
incidentally assures its holder of a very good salary. 
The examination will be held August 10, and unsuc- 
cessful candidates will not be mortified by the pub- 
lication of their names. The exact nature of the 
test appears from the following announcement : 
" There will be no supervised or assembled examina- 
tions. On the day set for the test candidates will be 
furnished with a full statement of the conditions 
surrounding the Chicago Public Library, its resources, 
equipment, and field to be covered ; also a statement 
of the local conditions as to population, character 
of the same, and similar information calculated to 
place before the candidate the problem which con- 
fronts Chicago in the development of its public 
library. With this information before them, can- 
didates will be requested to reduce to writing a 
professional judgment of the proper administration 
of the Chicago Public Library. A paper thus pre- 
pared must be filed with the Commission on or 
before September 10, and must be the original work 
of the applicant. A full statement of education, 
training, and experience will also be required, sub- 
ject to careful verification by examiners." 

The shameless " fakes " of book- agents, and 
their success in fleecing people who ought to know 
better, have often been referred to in these columns. 
The case of a wealthy New York woman who was 
induced to pay $85,000 for an "extra-illustrated" 
copy of a rejuvenated "plug" that any reputable 
dealer could have told her was worth at most but a 
few hundreds, is fresh in mind through the notoriety 
given it by some sensational court proceedings. But 
such exposures seem to do little to stop the traffic, — 
it may be, rather, that they encourage it by showing 
how easily the game may be tried by an operator 
sufficiently bold and adroit, and the enormous profits 
that come from it when successful. The whole 
dependence of the dishonest agent is of course upon 
the gullibility of human nature and the almost super- 
natural splendor of the "proposition" which he is 
able to present to the dazzled vision of his victims. 
" Fake " gold-mines or u fake " book -schemes, the 
game is much the same. 

A bit of Boston-made slang, fresh from the 
innocent lips of a little Boston girl, will interest the 
curious student of colloquialisms and their origin. 
It appears that our little maiden of Beacon Hill was 
looking forward with extreme pleasure to a prom- 
ised outing, and she expressed herself as expecting 
that when the day arrived she and her companions 
would " startle the pigeons from their perch." 
Naturally enough, her elders were struck by the 
strange expression and asked her whence she had 
got it. " Why, it 's in ' Paul Revere's Ride,' " was 
the ready reply, in a tone of surprise at such ignor- 
ance. The picturesque phrase was adopted by the

family circle, whence it soon began to spread, and 
one may expect to hear it before many months in 
Galveston and Tacoma. The parentage of much of j 
our slang, and even of many exclamations con- 
sidered profane or vulgar, or both, might prove to 
be no less respectable than this latest example of 
vigorous and expressive English. 

England's greatest living novelist, since the 
death of George Meredith, is by common consent 
Mr. Thomas Hardy, who has recently entered on 
his seventieth year. Like Meredith, he waited 
long for full recognition, and, like Johnson in his 
reproachful letter to Chesterfield, he could probably 
tell the public that its homage and its bounty are 
now too late to serve the end which, if bestowed 
years ago, they would have so acceptably met. But 
the great public is in this respect like the gods : to 
those who scorn its charities its arms fly open wide. 
It is gratifying to recall that Mr. Hardy's fame in 
America is of rather earlier date than his recogni- 
tion in his own country — another of the many 
proofs we have given of a certain intellectual alert- 
ness and a warm-hearted readiness to acknowledge 
literary ability wherever manifested, even if we do 
sometimes pirate the products of foreign genius. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



SWINBURNE AND MAUPASSANT. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I am an interested reader of Mr. House's letter, in 
your issue of July 16, quoting from Mr. Gosse's remin- 
iscences of Swinburne. Mr. House corrects the too- 
picturesque account of Maupassant's rescue of the 
English poet at Etretat in 1870. Mr. Edward Wright, 
in a recent number of " T. P.'s Weekly," gives an ac- 
count of this accident, and of its sequel. The version 
I have seen is substantially as follows: 

'"I was very young,' says Maupassant in one of his rare 
scraps of autobiography, ' and I was passing- the summer at 
Etretat. One morning about ten o'clock I heard some sailors 
crying out that a man was drowning by the Petite Porte. I 
entered a boat with them, and we rowed to the rescue. A 
swimmer, ignorant of the terrible current that swept by the 
place, had been caught in it and carried out to sea. But 
before I arrived he was picked up by a fishing smack. In 
the evening I learnt that the swimmer was an English poet, 
Mr. Swinburne. He was staying at Etretat with another 
Englishman, and I received an invitation to lunch with them 
the next morning at their chalet. I was surprised by the 
appearance of Mr. Swinburne ... a kind of fantastic appari- 
tion reminding me of the figures in Edgar Poe's tales. He 
seemed almost supernatural, and his body was continually 
agitated by nervous tremors. 

M ' Human bones were scattered about the tables, and 
among them was the flayed hand of a parricide. Around the 
room prowled an ape, whose grimaces were unimaginably 
droll. Full of frolic and mischief, it was not an ape, but a 
silent friend of its masters. 

" ' Some days later I was again invited to lunch by these 
eccentric Englishmen. They bought a monkey from a dealer 
in wild animals at Havre in order to taste what roast monkey 
is like. It was being cooked when I entered the chalet. The 



smell alone upset me, and the frightful savor took from me 
all desire for meals of that kind. I never saw Mr. Swinburne 
again.' " 

" In ' The Flayed Hand ' Mr. Swinburne becomes a French- 
man, and he is strangled in the night by the macabre object 
which hangs in his bedroom. But, as has been remarked, 
the story ... is not as good as the ordinary run of tales in 
our popular magazines." 

I think I am not the only reader of The Dial who 
would like to know the source of this strange "scrap 
of autobiography," and whether the facts bear it out. 
My recollection of the study of Guy de Maupassant by 
M. Maynial, and of the biographical notes contained in 
the first volume of the fine new edition of his works 
issued from the press of the Imprimerie Nationale, does 
not include anything of the kind. I should be glad to 
know whether the incident of the Flayed Hand (worked 
over in Maupassant's youthful story of that name), and 
that of the monkey-banquet, are to be regarded as au- 



thentic.

SHAKESPEARE OR BACON ? 
(To the Editor of The Diax.) 

Perhaps no question is being forced upon the attention 
of students of English literature with more persistence 
than this: How can we prove that Francis Bacon wrote 
the plays that are commonly attributed to William 
Shakespeare? 

I desire to call attention to a line of proof which has 
been strangely disregarded. In looking about for a 
means of conveying to a distant posterity information 
which he was determined to withhold from those who 
knew him personally, Lord Bacon could not adopt any 
cipher, any veiled method of communication, which 
required that an Elizabethan printing-office should do 
its work carefully and accurately. The First Folio 
edition of Shakespeare's plays (so-called) swarms with 
manifest misprints of many kinds. These would utterly 
dislocate and forever conceal any ordinary cipher mes- 
sage which had been entrusted to the text 

It is necessary, therefore, that we look at the larger 
characteristics of the plays in order to find the veiled 
message that we are seeking. In particular, I wish to 
direct attention to one striking peculiarity which is 
present in all the plays ascribed to Shakespeare, with a 
very few exceptions ; and these exceptions are in them- 
selves suspicious. I refer to the alternation of verse 
and prose. Delius and other scholars have studied this 
matter in some detail, seeking to find the law which 
governs this strange fluctuation in the outward form of 
the dramas ; but they have missed entirely the larger 
message which I will now indicate. 

What is the natural symbolism of this feature of the 
plays? Could any interpretation be more natural, more 
unforced, more certain, than that which I express in the 
following double equation? 

Verse + prose + verse + prose = a streak of fat + a streak of 
lean + a streak of fat + a streak of lean = Bacon. 
It will surprise every reader of this communication 
to learn that, though I have convinced several persons 
by the above argument that Bacon wrote the plays in 
question, yet I myself still cling with a foolish fondness 
to the older view, and hesitate to become an apostle of 
the new faith. Albert H. TolMan.

A Servant of Humanity.* 

It is now three years since the first volume 
of Mrs. Richards's " Journals, Life and Letters 
of Samuel Gridley Howe" made at last acces- 
sible the full history of that remarkable man's 
earlier life — a period which was happily sum- 
marized in the title chosen for the volume, " The 
Greek Revolution." The title of her second 
volume, which carries his story to the end — 
" The Servant of Humanity " — is equally apt. 
It might, indeed, have been given to both ; from 
his earliest days the service of humanity was with 
him a constant, brave, cheerful, absorbing pas- 
sion. One feels, however, a true distinction 
between the more adventurous and spectacular 
circumstances of the years when he was busy 
with the struggle between Greek and Turk, 
Christianity and Islam, liberty and old-world 
tyranny, and the habitually more quiet sur- 
roundings of his unwearied efforts at home to 
alleviate suffering, to illuminate darkness, to 
lighten the burden of the lowly. The first called 
forth his rare and buoyant aspiration of mind 
and of spirit ; the second proved it constant, 
unbroken, unfailing to the very end. So, in 
giving us these two phases of him separately, 
his daughter, Mrs. Richards, has done well. 
She has done well, too, in letting him tell his 
own story ; and she has done particularly well 
in the matter of self-restraint. A work impelled 
at once by enthusiastic sympathy and filial piety 
is in danger of fulsomeness. From this the 
volumes are refreshingly free. They present 
historical facts, no doubt, from the extremely 
definite point of view occupied by Dr. Howe ; 
they show us his friends and contemporaries 
from his own angle of vision ; wherefore, they 
can hardly be accepted as critical history. 
None the less, they are a faithful portrayal of 
how life appeared, during the ardent nineteenth 
century, — the century of Reform succeeding 
upon Revolution, — to an impetuous spirit 
intensely harmonious with the philanthropic 
aspirations of his time. 

Samuel Gridley Howe was born in Boston 
on November 10, 1801. His father was a 
Jeffersonian Democrat, a fact which probably 
affected the son's opinions throughout life. The 
dominant classes of New England at that time 

♦The Journals, Life and Letters of Samuel

Richards. With Notes by F. B. Sanborn. Volume L, The

were mostly Federalists. No state of society 
and politics could have been more favorable to 
the growth of deeply implanted conviction, on 
the part of one ancestrally in opposition, that 
things are wrong because they are in the hands 
of the wrong people, and consequently that who- 
ever is in control of anything ought to be got 
out of it for the benefit of mankind. Dr. Howe 
was far too powerful a man — too practical, too 
orderly and efficient — to entertain any such 
fantastic doctrine of anarchy. Throughout the 
story of his admirable career, however, you feel 
an undercurrent of assumption that the under 
dog is the better beast, that whoever has him 
under may best be removed by a summary pro- 
cess of thrashing, and that he may more than 
probably be preserved from dangerous rabidity 
by a judicious dose of freedom and moral sua- 
sion, in varying proportions according to the 
circumstances of his case. With some such 
prepossession, the boy went to school in Boston, 
took his degree at Brown College in 1821, and 
became Doctor of Medicine at Harvard in 1824. 
Before the end of that year he had already made 
his way to Greece, urged thereto partly by his 
enthusiasm for Byron. There, for years, he 
played his brave part — surgeon, soldier, knight- 
errant, friend and helper of a people striving to 
rise, — in such manner as the first volume of 
Mrs. Richards's work has already set forth. His 
life-work would have been picturesquely and 
admirably memorable had it ended in 1832, 
when outspoken sympathy with Poland got the 
" Hero of the Greek Revolution " for a while 
into a Prussian prison. 

It is possible, indeed, that the brilliant and 
daring work of those early years was as fruitful 
as any he ever did. Such spirit as his, infused 
generously into the atmosphere at once thrilling 
and stifling of eldest Europe, was needful to 
make Greece what Greece has become — living 
Greece once more. Distant from us, however, 
both in time and by the width of Atlantic and 
Mediterranean together, the result of that sep- 
arate period of his life seems splendidly indis- 
tinct, at least in comparison with that of the 
long and more coherent years which followed at 
home. There, beyond peradventure, you find 
his traces clear as ever, now when he has lain 
a third of a century in his grave. So long as the 
blind stay blind to light, or the feeble-minded 
to reason, those whom their misery touches will 
be forever happier for his work and his teach- 
ings. No work or teaching can avert suffering, 
or level the inequalities of Nature. None could 
have done more than his to alleviate them. In

Mrs. Richards's new volume, he tells his story 
for himself. The teaching of the blind, the alter- 
ation — which he always believed a vital reform 

— in the traditional methods of education, the 
strengthening of the feeble-minded, succeed one 
another in turn, the new never supplanting the 
old, but rather adding itself thereto in the sum 
of a comprehensive philanthropic activity which 
seems always ultimate until you find it re- 
doubled and still inexhaustible. Such a tem- 
perament could not have lacked what must 
seem to some of us vagaries. He was as ready 
to welcome Kossuth as he had been to call 
into spiritual being the darkened soul of Laura 
Bridgman ; as passionate in his opposition to 
slavery, and as relentless in sentiment to those 
who saw our national agony in other ways than 
his, as he had been merciful and benignant to 
idiocy ; and as devout, in his own unfettered 
way, as if he had never strayed from the fold 
of orthodoxy. He was an ardent advocate of 
Free Soil in Kansas, a devoted admirer of John 
Brown, a lifelong intimate of Charles Sumner. 
He was a leading spirit, the while, in the benefi- 
cent work of the Sanitary Commission, and in 
that which after the emancipation of the slaves 
inquired deliberately into the condition and the 
prospects of the Freedmen ; he was deeply con- 
cerned with the Board of State Charities in 
Massachusetts ; and in his old age he did his 
utmost to help on the Cuban Revolution, and 
to secure the annexation of Santo Domingo to 
the United States. Through it all, beyond 
most militant reformers, he kept his friends, or 
at least retained the cordial respect of those 
from whose friendship his restless and ardent 
sense of duty debarred him. The title of Mrs. 
Richards's final chapter — " The Good Knight 
without Fear and without Reproach " — hardly 
seems hyperbolical ; and no one would deny the 
truth of her simple words : " On January 9th 
(1876) his great spirit departed." 

" Great " seems none too great a word for 
him, as you lay the volume down. Yet the dead 
ride fast. Even in his own time he was not 
precisely dominant ; in ours his memory is per- 
haps dim, except with those who knew him, and 
with those to whom — as to the readers of his 
daughter's pages — he must always seem still 
alive. Partly, no doubt, this is a matter of the 
happy accident that his wife — the most brilliant, 
accomplished, and beloved woman among the 
American reformers of the Nineteenth Century 

— was throughout the years of their union a 
figure as admirably well-known, in public and 
in private, as he ; and that, years younger than 



he, she has survived to our own times, when we 
may fancy her, in the beautiful ripeness of her 
unbroken and serene old age, thinking of his 
seventy-five years as youthful. Partly, however, 
it is surely a matter of the restless comprehen- 
siveness of his unwavering philanthropy. Had 
he been only the hero of the Greek Revolution, 
he would have loomed more distinct ; so if he 
had been only the Savior of the Blind, or the 
Creator of Reason in the Feeble-Minded ; or 
only a passionate Abolitionist, or a professional 
minister to the sufferings of our soldiery. The 
other men of his time were more willing com- 
pletely to concentrate their powers. The secret 
of his personality lay most of all in the certainty 
that wherever you found the powers of others 
concentrated for the welfare of the friendless, 
there you would find him urging on the work with 
all the intensity of an enthusiasm mature from the 
beginning and youthful to the end. That which 
pervades is never that which is most salient. 

One might criticise, beyond dispute. By no 
means all of us are sure that men are wiser than 
Nature ; that a life devoted to the strengthening 
of the weak may not prove in the end to have 
done troublous work by unwittingly weakening 
the strong. By no means all that was best in 
nineteenth-century New England was comprised 
in its philanthropy ; by no means all the philan- 
thropists, high on their pedestals to-day, look 
stainless when you come to scrutinize them. Any 
reader of this volume who knows the period with 
which it deals, however, is abundantly able to 
make such comments for himself ; and any to 
whom the period is strange may turn to these 
pages with full confidence that they truly set 
forth what seemed daily truth to a spiritually 
great man. Baerett Wendell.

General Kuropatkin's appointment to command 
the Russian army then operating in Manchuria. 
It was indeed the irony of fate that elevated 
Kuropatkin to this command, because he, more 
than any other man in Russia, had striven to 
prevent the declaration of war. Better than any 
of his countrymen, he knew that the Empire was 
not prepared to draw the sword in the Far East, 
and he had sounded repeated warnings to the 
Tsar that the policy of exploiting Korea and 
ignoring the solemn obligation to evacuate 
Manchuria upon the conclusion of the Boxer 
rebellion would provoke the Japanese to arms 
in defense of their interests. Nobody in Russia 
understood so well the military preparedness of 
the Japanese. He had visited the rival Empire 
and had studied her military and financial con- 
dition. But against his advice the Grand Dukes, 
and eventually the Tsar, who were interested in 
the timber exploitation on the Yalu, persisted in 
the ways of folly until war became inevitable. 

Kuropatkin's commission of command was 
issued February 20, 1904 — two weeks after 
the breaking off of diplomatic relations between 
the Russian and Japanese governments, and 
two days after the Russian declaration of war. 
Retiring from the position of War Minister, 
which he had held for six years, the General 
left St. Petersburg March 12 and joined the 
army at Liao-yang March 27. Nominally, he 
was Commander-in-Chief of the Manchurian 
Army of Operations ; but in reality, until 
October 25, 1904, he was subordinate to an 
officer not actually at the front, being designated 
as assistant to the Viceroy, Admiral Alexieff, 
whose headquarters were at Harbin. March 17, 
1905, he was superseded by General Linievitch ; 
so that the period during which Kuropatkin was 
in independent command was limited to approx- 
imately four and a half months. The principal 
events of those four and a half months were the 
capitulation of Port Arthur and the disastrous 
battle of Mukden. After the appointment of 
Linievitch to the chief command, Kuropatkin 
continued to serve in a subordinate position in 
command of the First Army until the close of 
the war. After peace was concluded, in Sep- 
tember, 1905, he remained in Manchuria super- 
intending the demobilization of the Russian 
forces, proceeding, upon the completion of this 
task in 1906, to his country seat, Sheshurino, 
in the province of Pskoff , where he entered upon 
a life of strict retirement. 

It was while the work of demobilization was 
still in progress that the General undertook the 
preparation of his history of the war. The task 



was planned and executed on an ambitious scale. 
Of the four ponderous volumes in which the 
history was eventually published, the first was 
taken up with a detailed account of the battle 
of Liao-yang, written in large part by Colonel 
Ilinski, of the General Staff ; the second volume, 
prepared mainly by Colonel Bolkhovitinoff, 
dealt in similar fashion with the battle of Sha 
Ho ; the third volume, on the battle of Mukden, 
and the fourth, a summary of the war, were 
written by General Kuropatkin himself. The 
entire work was suppressed by the Russian Gov- 
ernment almost as soon as it appeared. For- 
tunately, however, it has been made possible for 
a translation of the most valuable portions to 
be given to English readers, in the two volumes 
at present under review. Volume I. of the 
translation contains the Translator's Preface, 
the Author's Introduction, and the first eight 
chapters of Kuropatkin's original fourth vol- 
ume. Volume II. contains the remaining four 
chapters of that book, together with the Intro- 
duction and Conclusion of Kuropatkin's third 
volume (discussing the antecedents and the con- 
sequences of the battle of Mukden), and two 
useful appendices. The English edition is much 
abridged, but for the student and the general 
reader alike it contains decidedly the most valu- 
able portions of the original history. 

What General Kuropatkin has sought to 
do is to interpret the events and results of the 
Russo-Japanese war in the light of the anterior 
development and present condition of the Rus- 
sian Empire. His earlier chapters take, there- 
fore, the form of a running sketch of the salient 
facts of Russia's political, military, and economic 
history during the two hundred years since Peter 
the Great. These chapters are suggestive, and 
on the military side especially valuable ; but 
they constitute, after all, only a background for 
the consideration of the principal subject dis- 
cussed in the book — namely, the reasons for 
the Russian reverses and the Japanese successes 
during the recent war. In genuinely illumina- 
ting and informing qualities, the four chapters 
devoted to this theme have not been surpassed, 
and it may be doubted whether the Tsar himself, 
were he so inclined, could speak more authori- 
tatively upon the subject. 

The causes of Russia's failure in the war 
are classified by General Kuropatkin in three 
groups. The first comprises causes " independ- 
ent of the war ministry" — the lack of diplo- 
matic arrangements, such as Prussia enjoyed in 
1870-71, permitting the massing of the entire 
armed force against the enemy, the subordinate

the internal disorders in Russia, which affected 
the spirit of the army. The second group of 
causes includes those dependent on the War 
Ministry, for which officers in the field were 
not responsible — the delay in mobilizing the 
reinforcements for the Far East, the delay in 
promoting those who distinguished themselves 
in the field, the deficiencies in technical equip- 
ment and in the personnel of both officers and 
men. The third group — those for which offi- 
cers in the field were alone responsible — com- 
prise the absence of a true military feeling 
among the troops, the lack of determination on 
the part of commanders of all degrees to carry 
out the tasks entrusted to them, and the break- 
down of the organization under the stress of war. 
Viewing the question from the other side, Gen- 
eral Kuropatkin considers that the Japanese won 
in the struggle because of the preponderance of 
their fleet, their superior acquaintance with the 
theatre of land operations, their immense advan- 
tages in communication and the transport of 
supplies, their intellectual alertness and their 
readiness to profit by experience. " But the 
principal thing," concludes the writer, " which 
gave success to the Japanese was their high 
moral tone. It made victory seem worth any 
sacrifice, and led directly to that determination 
to win which characterized all ranks from 
Commander-in-Chief to private soldier. . . . 
One thing is certain : that if the whole army 
had not been saturated with patriotism, if it 
had not felt the friendly support of the nation 
behind it, if it had not realized the supreme 
importance of the struggle, the endeavors of its 
leaders would have been in vain." Broadly 
speaking, says Kuropatkin, "we underestimated 
Japan's power, particularly her moral strength, 
and entered upon the war far too lightly." 

Notwithstanding all of this, it is interesting 
to note — and herein lies the predominating argu- 
ment of the book — the author's belief that the 
war was brought to a premature conclusion, that 
peace was declared at a moment when victory 
lay within Russia's grasp, when her strength was 
at its maximum and when that of Japan had 
begun to ebb. The larger part of the army in 
the field is declared to have shared this convic- 
tion. The author maintains, in the first place, 
that at the time when peace was concluded 
Russia's material forces were steadily growing. 
In evidence of this he cites the fact that during 
the war the carrying capacity of the Siberian 
Railway was increased sixfold, that at the end 



of the war the army, already a million strong, 
was still growing, and that the state of supplies, 
stores, and equipment far surpassed that obtain- 
ing: when war was declared. It is maintained, 
in the second place, that the army had undergone 
marked improvement in morale, and the author 
tells at some length of the measures which were 
instituted during the period of his command to 
promote the spirit of earnestness and comrade- 
ship among the soldiery. And, finally, the 
attempt is made, with a certain measure of 
success, to demonstrate that in 1905 " the 
enemy's army began to weaken in a moral as well 

• as a material sense," on account of the heavy 
casualties, the draft system, scarcity of funds, 
and the indifference to her successes which 
Europe and America were beginning to exhibit. 
That, in the midst of these conditions, the 
serious state of Russia's internal affairs and the 
sluggishness of the Russian people compelled a 
premature abandonment of the war, is regarded 

! by the author as an unmitigated calamity. 
" The consequences," he writes, " of making 
such a peace, by which Japan was recognized 
as Russia's conqueror in Asia, will have serious 
results, not only for us but for all of the Powers 
who have possessions or interests on that con- 
tinent. The ' Yellow Peril,' the appearance of 
which has only recently been foreseen, is now a 
reality. Notwithstanding her victorious issue 
from the war, Japan is hurriedly increasing her 

i forces, while China is forming a large army 
under the guidance of Japanese officers and on 
the Japanese model. In a very short space of 
time she and Japan will be able to pour an army 
of more than 1,500,000 into Manchuria, which, 
if directed against us, could proceed to take a 
great deal of Siberia from Russia, and reduce 
her to a second-rate Power." 

It is apparent from this, and from other pas- 
sages that might be cited, that the author expects 
another war. Indeed, he proceeds to point out 
certain precautions which Russia must promptly 
take if she is to be prepared for the renewal of 
the struggle. She must be in a position inter- 
nationally to make use of all her troops against 
the enemy. She must have thorough railway 
communication with the Far East. She must 
prepare the waterways of Siberia for the carriage 
of heavy goods in bulk from west to east. She 
must move the army's base as far as possible from 
Europe into Siberia. And — what is most impor- 
tant, and. one may add, most difficult — she must 
make ready to carry on a new war, not only with 
the army but with the whole of a patriotic nation.

Stage Plays and Poetical Dramas.* 

Among the plays published during the past 
winter and spring (and there have been this 
year more than usual) there have been all degrees 
of excellence. Some that need not be named 
seem to have been good pieces of work for 
amateur theatricals. Nor are such things to be 
slighted. For if one of the requirements of the 
drama at present be, as so many would have it, 
an educated theatrical management, certainly 
another requirement is an educated audience. 
And for an audience to have a good appreciation 
of the technical side of a play, nothing is better 
than to have had experience in writing and acting 
plays. So the more that sort of thing is well 
and intelligently done, the more people are there 
in the country who will want a good drama, and 
in time will have it. Plays that seem somewhat 
amateur in character are often excellent things 
in their own way, even though they do not call 
for much public notice. There are also, it must 
be added, a number among the year's publica- 
tions which cannot come under this head, and 
which still fail of any real excellence, but prob- 
ably it will be best to pass over all such. 

Of the published plays that are really worth 
while, there are two kinds. One is the usual 
play, as we may call it — the stage-play, the play 
written for the stage and acted with more or less 
effect. Such, for instance, is Mr. Percy Mac- 
kaye's " Mater," acted and published last fall. 
This play should perhaps have received extended 
notice at the time ; and yet it may be as well 
that it did not, for though certainly a stage suc- 
cess, it was even on the stage a good deal of a 
disappointment, and that disappointment became 
more definite when the book appeared. One 
regrets not to be able always to admire Mr. 
Mackaye's work, for his effort is so certainly in 
the right direction. Yet " Mater," although a 
clever piece (I feel sure) in stage technique, and 
undoubtedly amusing in presentation and in 
point, did not really come near the possibilities 
that it made obvious. The beginning of the 
play showed what might have been achieved : 
the end of the play seemed weak because it did 
not achieve it. The play gave a chance to get 
beyond the farce it really became, into something

which, while amusing and entertaining, should 
yet show a reach after things of more account. 
That is the trouble with many American plays 
nowadays. They show at the beginning real 
dramatic possibility, and then develop into farces 
or melodramas, apparently because our play- 
wrights cannot conceive their ideas fully, or are 
unable to carry them out, or perhaps because 
they feel that the audience does not care for such 
matters. In "Mater," Mr. Mackaye had a fine 
and original conception. He seems to have 
begun with the notion of presenting the power 
of a brilliant and poetic but common-sense and 
human personality in the immense chaos of talk 
and bombast that prevails in America to-day. 
Mater could appreciate all the lyrics of her 
poetical son and her philanthropic daughter, 
yet she could go each one better by accomplish- 
ing through simple common-sense the things 
they sought to accomplish by exalted rhodomon- 
tade. Surely that was a chance : that is America 
in a nutshell ; America is just the place for 
humanity to show itself among the heroics. It 
was a pity that Mr. Mackaye allowed this con- 
ception to slip away from him while he pursued 
a farcical and impossible intrigue between 
Mater and a stage politician. We feel a sense 
of disappointment which we should not feel if 
the author himself had not shown us what he 
might have accomplished. 

No such sense attends the performance or the 
reading of Mr. Du Maimer's " An Englishman's 
Home "; just the reverse is the case. In this play 
one waits expectant through the terrible tedious- 
ness of the first act, wondering how any power 
can relieve such a proceeding from oblivion ; and 
yet, as the play goes on, one becomes more and 
more absorbed, and, in going from one interest 
to a greater, sees that the sordid stupidity of 
the first act was an absolute necessity to the 
impression that is aimed at. The general point 
of the play is doubtless widely known : it presents 
an episode in an imaginary invasion of England 
by some other country, now vaguely mentioned 
as Nearland, elsewhere as the Empire of the 
North. The book bears out well the strong 
impression of the play on the stage, which comes 
chiefly from the contrast between the superficial 
sport-loving household of the English, and the 
foolish inexperience and ignorant courage of her 
volunteers, and the energetic business-like way 
of the Black Dragoons of Her Imperial Majesty. 
It is a hard hit at English life, — much of it 
well-deserved without a doubt, and much of it 
thoroughly appreciated over there. Yet it is 
not merely a hard hit : the author is an English-

man himself, and shows clearly the true manli- j 
ness in the midst of the superficial foolishness, i 
Indeed, even with the slight and stupid sport- ' 
mad boys and girls there are good points among 
the bad ones. The typical old John Bull, who 
at the beginning of the play is learning to play 
Diabolo with a book, turns at the end into a 
lion defending his home. But with all the strong 
and good hidden under the weak and foolish, 
there is not enough, in the general impression, 
to cope with the business-like way of doing things, 
the reckoning with realities, of the foreigners. 

But one need not take the play simply as a 
criticism, needed or not, upon the English. Per- 
haps the same sort of criticism is needed here, 
though I think that we in America need more 
the criticism that Mater might have given had 
she been so disposed, the criticism of a warm 
heart and a clear head upon our wonderful 
exhibitions of buncombe and bustle. The warn- 
ing of " An Englishman's Home " may not be 
particularly necessary for America, yet it has a 
significance wider even than America ; it has 
that appeal to human nature itself that, where 
it is sure and clear, makes a thing great. The 
remarkable power of M. Rostand, I used to 
think, was because the courageous Cyrano and 
the slight Due de Rostand were both such typi- 
cal figures, giving us a feeling of kinship either 
with the man who knew himself to be greater 
than the world could ever rate him, or else with 
the man who saw in the world opportunities that 
were his, and yet were too great for him to 
master. In somewhat the same manner, Mr. 
Du Maurier's play has its universal appeal, for 
everyone can feel the force of this tremendous 
contrast between the light-hearted superficiality 
that is content to amuse itself from day to day, 
and the energetic realism that forges ahead 
slowly in the line of fact. 

Yet even here such an impression as this 
would fail to make the play effective were it not 
that it was well- written. And it is a consider- 
able triumph that without the aid of variation 
of circumstance and with little of strong char- 
acter Mr. Du Maurier has made a play of 
absorbing interest even to those who dislike the 
melodramatic fusillades that seem to be neces- 
sary. Not only are the general lines of the play 
well-conceived, but the details are effectively 
worked out in character as well as in situation. 
It is true to life and uninfluenced by conven- 
tion.* Reggie Brown, for instance, instead of 
being roused by the great crisis to become a 
hero, remains Reggie Brown to the end ; his

sister Maggie is full of a desire to help and be 
of use, but has no single practical idea of what 
to do. All this is realism ; it may be that the 
spectator will think the realism of the first act 
too strong, there is certainly no let-up in the 
dead-level of stupidity exhibited by touch after 
touch. Yet not one touch is wrong, and it is 
probable that each one is necessary to the con- 
trast which is the life of the piece. 

It is something of a change to turn from " An 
Englishman's Home " to Mr. George Cabot 
Lodge's " Herakles," and one may inquire why 
the two shoidd come into the same article. The 
first answer is that both are dramas ; which some 
may think as satisfactory as it would be to say 
that both were books. " Herakles " is a poetic 
drama, a drama reminiscent of the Greek, 
although I am not sure that Mr. Lodge felt 
himself much bound by the canons of Athenian 
tragedy. It is, then, not so much a stage-play, 
but rather a poem, which the poet has chosen to 
cast in dramatic form. I am a little more doubt- 
fid than I used to be as to how far dramas of 
this sort are comparable with plays written for 
the present stage. A view of a Greek or a 
Latin play, which one may easily have nowa- 
days on some university occasion, — indeed, a 
view of an Elizabethan play in Elizabethan 
fashion, — is likely to take us so far from all ordi- 
nary dramatic conceptions that we cannot make 
any sort of comparisons with the plays we are 
used to. 

One comparison with the acting drama we 
can make. "We can assure ourselves that 
" Herakles " is a very fine piece of work, and 
that it makes a strong appeal to noble emotions 
as a great play should. It is full of delightful 
poetry, to which one will recur over and over 
again ; but it has also its main appeal, or im- 
pression, by which we may think of it as a defi- 
nite whole rather than a mere collection of 
interesting facts. From its main idea, as I 
understand it, I entirely dissent ; but there can 
be little doubt that the idea is well conceived 
and strongly enforced. At the very beginning, 
almost with the first words of the weary poet and 
the chance-met woman, we are impressed with 
the idea of something of reality behind the beau- 
tiful imaginative lines which otherwise might 
absorb our minds like the figures and costumes 
and scenery at the theatre. We have not 
space to run through the development, — the 
hunger of the world for something finer and 
nobler than their life yet gives, the appearance 
of Herakles, restless but full of powers and pos- 
sibilities, the recognition, and, as we may say, 



70 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



self -recognition, — but it is foolish to try to give 
the idea. One would only spoil the poet's con- 
ception, which one ought to get only as he gives 
it. Mr. Lodge has taken old names and stories 
and given them essential reality once more. I 
suppose it is not the reality that they had to the 
Greek ; but that is a matter of archaeology. 
More to the point is it that in these figures, — 
the Poet, the Woman, Herakles, Creon, — we 
have not merely vital personalities, but person- 
alities of Life as we know it. Not in the cir- 
cumstance in which we see it, of course ; but 
then, even in Mr. Du Maurier's play, the cir- 
cumstance, though more carefully worked out, 
is really a minor point. It is not life in the 
form in which we know it, but certainly there it 
is, with its pulsings and its possibilities, very 
fine, very wonderful, very august. 

I ask myself now and then how the play 
would seem on the stage ; and always return to 
the idea that nowadays we cannot appreciate 
poetry when recited, as those did who could not 
read. I do not suppose Mr. Lodge had the 
stage in mind when he wrote ; but that is not 
important, for everything is good on the stage 
that people like to see, whether meant for the 
stage or not, and I would far rather see this than 
much that is actually meant for the stage. And 
however that be, the poem as read is satisfying 
to the lover of noble thought and lovely imagery. 
Whether it be really a dramatic development, 
I cannot be so sure ; but still the drama is a 
remarkable achievement, and one of which we 
may well be proud. 

There is little room left for a word on Mr. 
Martin Schiitze's " Hero and Leander." Cast 
in a less classic form than Mr. Lodge's poem, 
more modern in its rendering of the life and 
color of Greek life, this poetic drama aims at 
and gives a different impression. Lacking, as 
I must think, the power of conceiving its motive 
that seems needful to impress strikingly the 
mind, it yet has very considerable imaginative 
power, both in its figures and its details, and in 
the curious directness of its verse. With all its 
modernity, however, it has a classic beauty of 
clearness and outline that gives it an especial 
and singular charm. 

These plays are all worth reading. Perhaps 
they interest me too much, as representing phases 
of current literarj r feeling, to appreciate them 
quite correctly in and for themselves. Still, 
even without regard to literary feelings and 
fashions, they certainly have in them much that 
is well worth while.

Arthur Symons as a Critic* 



Mr. Arthur Symons's " Book of Theory," as 
he calls it in the sub-title, is much more than a 
new edition of his " Plays, Acting, and Music "; 
more, I mean, than is implied usually by the 
words. He has omitted, added, and changed, 
until one who possesses the first edition will feel 
it necessary, in order to keep up with Mr. 
Symons, to own this later volume. The volume, 
moreover, is intended to form one of a series in 
which the author's critical method as applied to 
literature and the arts may be set forth. The 
completion of the plan is not probable, in view 
of the deplorable news that comes with regard 
to Mr. Symons's health : his working days, it 
would appear, are over. 

At its worst, Mr. Symons's criticism has an 
effect of the higher journalism : it is a review, 
done for an occasion. The suggestive paper on 
Paderewski is an example. But it is delightful, 
and not without penetrating appreciation and 
flashes of eloquence. At their best, on the other 
hand, these brief impressionistic talks on the 
great things of creative endeavor reveal a poet 
sensitive to beauty and insistent on testing all 
Art, subjectively but surely, by the test of 
aesthetic pleasure and that higher pleasure that 
is of the soul. The pages fairly teem with sug- 
gestive, stimulating, and brilliant remarks, the 
style in which they are conveyed being noticeable 
for its warm sensuous simplicity. 

This poet-critic's theory is not difficult to 
state, and it is a sound one, to my mind. It 
may be summed up in two sentences of his own : 
" In all forms of art, the point of view is of 
more importance than the subject-matter"; and 
" art has to do only with the creation of beauty." 
This insures breadth of view, because it escapes 
the danger of making technic the final word : 
with Symons, personality is the precious thing 
which must cooperate with technic to produce 
the desirable Beauty. And he would include 
among his artists (since they make beauty) the 
actor, the dancer, and the pianist ; they create 
what is lovely for an instant, but that is enough, 
for " art is concerned only with accomplishment, 
not with duration." 

Mr. Symons varies in manner according as 
his subject influences him. When discoursing 
of the drama, he is keen, witty, full of fresh 
thought ; when music is his theme, he is pre- 
dominately the poet ; if he discusses painting, 
the aesthetic seems to the fore. But above all,

his work is suggestive ; that perhaps is the mis- 
sion of the impressionist in criticism, — to drop 
seed-thoughts, to arouse by charm of manner, 
to make us think. I find his book, therefore, 
helpful and attractive, and am saddened by the 
reflection that such a man in what should be the 
full prime of his powers must cease from his lit- 
erarv labor. But Mr. Symons has come a long 
way forward since the " Yellow Book " days, 
when he was grouped with the extremists and 
degenerates. Richard Burton. 



The Childhood of the Race.* 



Leo Frobenius is one of the best-known of 
German ethnographers. His Ur sprung der 
Afrikaaischen Kulturen is one of the most 
suggestive and illuminating of books upon Cul- 
ture History. Preeminently a student of things, 
he has brought together a remarkable private 
collection of ethnographic objects, and has dili- 
gently worked through many European museums 
to acquaint himself with their contents. He 
has been a special student of primitive warfare, 
of the bows and arrows of the world, of masks 
and their use and meaning. His studies have 
centered upon Africa, and he has now ruade two 
great expeditions into the continent — one into 
the Kasai region of the Congo Free State, the 
other into the Kamerun. The narrative of the 
earlier of these journeys has been printed, and 
contains much valuable information and sugges- 
tion. Most of his writings exist only in German, 
and therefore those who desire the advance of 
knowledge and interest in ethnographic science, 
among non-professional readers especially, will 
welcome the appearance of one of his most pop- 
ular and least technical works in an English 
translation. 

" The Childhood of Man " appeals chiefly 
to a popular audience. To the serious student 
or the ethnologist, its value is more suggestive 
than informative. Frobenius is independent 
and bold to a degree. His fellow- workers do not 
assent to many of his most cherished dogmas, 
and much of his most brilliant work is viewed 
with serious misgiving or open hostility by 
them. What he writes is always interesting, 
often original, and usually deserves considera- 
tion. The alternative title of the book before 
us states it to be "a popular account of the 
lives, customs, and thoughts of the primitive 
races." The book consists of thirty-two chap-

delphia: J. B. Lippincott Company. 



ters, essays really, upon practices of savage and 
barbarous life. Some of the subjects presented 
are discussed in a single chapter ; for the elucida- 
tion of others, several chapters each are needed. 
This unevenness of importance in the topics 
treated is a defect in the book. There is no 
serious development of all the phases of the 
life of lower cultures, but rather the stringing 
together of a series of disconnected essays. 
Such topics as tattooing, drums, drum-language, 
skull-worship and head-hunting, ancestor wor- 
ship and fetichism, secret societies and masks, 
the path of the sun, early history of war and 
warlike peoples, are specialties of the author, 
and their presentation is at once most informa- 
tive, most suggestive, and most dangerous. 
The greater part of Frobenius's material is 
drawn from Africa and Melanesia ; some is 
from Polynesia, some from America. His best 
material and his real value in discussion is in 
the African and Melanesian field. He is at his 
worst in discussing American themes. Thus, 
the chapter upon picture-writing and decoration 
is a poor rehash of two well-known and easily 
accessible Bureau of American Ethnology 
papers. Were there an object in the chapter, 
or were the material well used or the matter 
carefully digested, we should not complain. 
One can but be surprised at Frobenius's use of 
the term " primitive." Surely the bulk of the 
populations upon which he draws most heavily 
for material are far from primitive. The book 
is illustrated with more than four hundred cuts, 
mostly of artefacts. 

Dr. A. H. Keane has edited and translated 
the work. His contributions to ethnology and 
ethnography are so many and serious that criti- 
cism seems ungracious. It appears to us, how- 
ever, that he has made an unwarranted and 
undesirable addition to Frobenius's book. The 
author himself would have improved the work 
by omitting all the American Tndian material ; 
he is not well acquainted with our field, either 
as a museum worker or field investigator. Dr. 
Keane further weakens the book by introducing 
eight full-page plates reproduced from " exces- 
sively rare water-colours belonging to the British 
Museum." They are over three hundred years 
old, u being taken directly from the volume of 
admirable drawings in water-colours executed 
by John White, one of the pioneer settlers in 
Virginia, to which he made five voyages and of 
which he was, for a short time, made Governor 
by Sir Walter Raleigh. . . ." The pictures are 
interesting enough in themselves, but they have 
nothing whatever to do with this book ; they do

not fit the plan, or the style, or the argument. 
Nor does the information accompanying them as 
legends help us much. The pictures have, per- 
haps, sufficient interest to warrant their inde- 
pendent publication with descriptive and explan- 
atory text, historical citations, references, and 
the like ; but here they are thrown away. It 
is a pity that Dr. Keane has not given them to 
us in the way indicated, rather than in this 
work. Frederick Starr. 



Pious Meditations from the 
Quarter-Deck .* 

Religious literature, reflective and devotional, 
hardly stands any longer at the bar of general 
criticism. Its standards are too narrow, its 
purposes too restricted. It commends itself, if 
at all, to a circle which radiates from the same 
centres of belief. Those belonging to another 
spiritual habitat easily fall into indifference 
or repulsion. " The Harvest Within : Being 
Thoughts on the Life of a Christian " is a work 
of devout and disjointed meditations, springing 
from a narrow and inflexible creed. It must 
be chiefly of interest to those who share its 
convictions. 

One is somewhat surprised to find Saul 
among the prophets — to find Captain Mahan, 
who deals with naval affairs so lengthily, inter- 
estedly, and jauntily, also one of those who 
hold to and unfold religious impressions in a 
manner consonant with the ministry. Yet, as 
a matter of fact, such a union is not strange. 
John Newton found the deck of a slaver a not 
unfavorable place for devout reflections. Our 
religious life, like our ships, may be built with 
compartments. We hope in extremity to be 
saved by opinions carefully divided from our 
daily activities. The chief feature of our faith 
seems at times to be the quickness and decision 
with which we can shut it up within itself. 
Naval thought, naval forecast, and a national 
life to be built up by naval skill, may not be 
inharmonious with a spiritual world chiefly 
permeated with the sense of power. Napoleon 
looked at military preparation as the assurance 
of safety in the circumstances by which he was 
surrounded. He filled the world with violence, 
and then regarded violence as giving the clue of 
action. The pious thoughts of Captain Mahan 
stand, in his own mind, in no collision with the 
naval policy of a nation. Devout faith main- 

*Thb Harvest Within. By A. T. Mahan, D.C.L., LL.D. 
Boston : Little, Brown, & Co. 



tains its footing with the ready exercise of force. 
It is a mistake to suppose that religious beliefs 
and social beliefs at war with each other cannot 
be entertained in the same minds. They may 
be so separated and so united that they make 
good deficiencies and give plausible terms of con- 
duct. The incongruity of incongruous things 
may be lost to the intellect and yet be present 
in character. 

The progress which religious thought has 
made, and is still making, lies chiefly in find- 
ing the medium of communication and interpre- 
tation between us and the spiritual world more 
continuous, more empirical ; a bridge on which 
the feet may continually pass and repass though 
its two abutments are wide apart. The method 
in religious inquiry has not been unlike that 
in the early research into the formation of the 
world. A cataclysm was always close at hand 
ready to explain any change. Constructive forces 
were overlooked or underrated. The feeling did 
not prevail that these forces gave rise to every 
apparent cataclyism, and that each cataclysm 
returned at once to these usual activities. 
Religious beliefs have propagated each other, 
and no need has been felt of a constant reference 
to some familiar experience open to us all. The 
world, physical and spiritual, lies between us and 
God, the most undeniable and explanatory proof 
of his being and government ; the nearest, plain- 
est, and most constant of his activities. This 
perpetual presence we have dealt with carelessly, 
as if we had some other and better terms of 
apprehending him. 

The world, as spiritual as it is physical, spir- 
itual always and everywhere in formation and 
development, instead of being regarded as a con- 
stant revelation, has been looked on as an island 
on which men have been marooned, to make 
what gains they can of it. The world, the flesh, 
and the devil have been alike hostile to redemp- 
tion, and the remedy against them has partaken 
of the nature of extermination. The divine work 
has been but partially understood, and we have 
striven to partake of it without being in har- 
mony with it. A partial revelation has received 
a harsh rendering, and by means of it we have 
been brought into conflict with the habitual rev- 
elation which envelopes us with spiritual incen- 
tives. An historic Bible, Hebrew Psalmist and 
Prophet, one phase of growth and disclosure, 
have been employed to limit and arrest the 
progress to which they were designed to con- 
tribute. They are what they are by appealing 
to the human mind, and working with it in its 
own channels. We are thought to have rational

powers sufficient to discover the authority of 
truth, but not sufficient to understand and grow 
by the truth itself. 

This is seen in the distrust, extending even to 
conflict, which grows up between morality and 
religion. Morality stands for the knowledge 
which, by insight and experience, we come to 
attain of the relations in conduct which we bear 
to our fellowmen : the germs by whose develop- 
ment we are made ready for the Kingdom of 
Heaven. Religion often establishes itself on 
some narrow dogma, as that of justice, and so 
renders but little heed to the patience, repents 
ance, and forgiveness finding wav in the social 
world. There is a substitution in thought of 
God's righteousness and God's gifts for our 
righteousness and gifts ; as if we might have an 
experience of God's excellence and favor aside 
from our own attainment. He that truly mag- 
nifies human power, equally magnifies divine 
power of which it is the highest expression. Our 
author thinks that what we call " human hero- 
ism comes to us because we reject the power that 
God supplies." When the human mind acts 
successfully, when it interprets correctly the 
divine plan and concurs with the divine method, 
it is most conspicuously religious. It is a strange 
antagonism which is established between divine 
wisdom and human wisdom, divine goodness 
and human goodness. " In nothing," says our 
author, " was more conspicuous the downward 
tendency of a recent falling from faith than 
when the man said of the Sermon on the Mount. 
• These things I accept, not because Christ said 
them, but because they commend themselves to 
my conscience, to my own moral sense.' It 
would be difficult to phrase more pathetically 
the distinction between human righteousness 
and God's righteousness." When the two cease 
to be identical, cease to illustrate and sustain 
each other, the spiritual world will drop into a 
confusion to which there can be no redemption. 
There is a religion in which salvation seems to 
consist in saving unbroken its own intellectual 
connections, and hardly at all in bringing to the 
world an harmonious extension of every just 
impulse, every kindly feeling. We do not say 
of this faith that it does no good, or of "The 
Harvest Within " that a considerable share of 
it is tares which the reapers, in the final gather- 
ing, will be charged to separate from wheat, for 
this is the common lot of all human thought ; 
but we do say that if the tares and wheat are 
to grow together it would be wiser to sow the 
purest seed we have. The winnowing process 
of the world takes place in the world itself : the 



winds scattering the light and vagrant material 
and letting the heavy kernels fall to the ground. 
We are content to wait for these living agencies 
to separate, in the future as in the past, the good 
and the evil which men are still so freely con- 
founding. John Bascom.

The city of the 
Leaning Tourer 



A valuable addition to the Dent- 
Macmillan series of volumes on 
u Mediaeval Towns " is one which tells 
" The Story of Pisa." Few travellers in Italy give to 
Pisa the time that it really deserves. Either they 
stop over one train en route from Genoa to Rome, 
or they take a single day's excursion to it from 
Florence, In either case, there is a tradition that 
the Leaning Tower and the buildings of its group 
are ■ all that is worth seeing." Few, perhaps, 
realize that Pisa is one of the most ancient cities of 
Italy, was famous when Rome was but a hamlet, and 
that it once treated on terms of equality with Chris- 
tian Emperors in Germany and in Constantinople. 
with Moslem Soldans in Bagdad and in Alexandria. 
To deal with this long and varied history — Pre- 
Roman, Roman, Lombard, Mediaeval, Florentine, 
and Italian — in brief space is not easy, but it has 
been done successfully by Mrs. Janet Ross in the 
opening hundred pages of this volume. The parts 
which the modern traveller will perhaps value most, 
however, are the three hundred pages that follow, 
containing the description of the city with drawings 
by Miss Xelly Erichsen. Besides interesting chapters 
about the most conspicuous "sights," the traveller 
will find a great deal usually ignored by the guide- 
books, especially the history of its palaces and the 
people who have occupied them from time to time. 
" No lovelier street can be seen in the whole world," 
wrote a traveller, in the year 1425, of the Lung'Arno ; 
and although only two or three of the palaces seen 
by him have survived, his description is almost, if 
not quite, true to-day. For although less picturesque 
in its buildings than the Lung' Arno of Florence, it 
surpasses it in beauty of line. The Arno itself is a 
statelier stream here than at Florence ; broad and 
full, it has gathered the waters of many affluents 
and rushes swiftly through the city as if eager to 
reach the sea. Congenial to poets, Pisa has always 
proved. Shelley said, " Our roots never struck so 
deeply as at Pisa "; here Robert and Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning spent the first winter of their 
married life, and here she gained courage to offer 
him her " Sonnets from the Portuguese "; here 
Giacomo Leopardi found renewed health and spirits, 
and wrote : " In April, after two years. I made 
verses again, real verses as in the old days, and with 
the heart of long ago." Whoever goes to Pisa with 
this book in his pocket will be sure to come under 
the spell, and will wish to remain weeks instead of 
hours.

[August 1, 



Our debt to 
our insect 
neighbors. 



Professor John B. Smith, author of 
" Our Insect Friends and Enemies " 
(Lippincott), has brought his sub- 
ject home to us in a way that admirably combines 
the scientific and the practical. The housekeeper who 
wishes to know more about the " hexapod " that is 
troubling her than merely its name, the farmer who 
wishes to know what insects are helpful and what 
harmful, and the casual person in search of general 
information, will all find here what is wanted. 
Having carefully marked off the insect from other 
animals by defining it as " a ringed animal with 
six jointed legs, breathing by means of air tubes or 
trachea?," the author goes on to treat of it in its 
relation to plants, to other insects — having regard 
to that balance of survival so important to man but 
so little understood by him — to other animals, to 
man, and especially to the farmer. A final chapter 
is given to the "War on Insects," and is full of the 
kind of wisdom that can be assimilated and applied. 
There is a colored plate of the commonest insects as 
a frontispiece, and the illustrations from microscopic 
slides, much enlarged, are numerous and plainly 
marked. One might gather from these illustrations 
that all insects, with their goggly eyes, their bristly 
legs and horn-like antennae, would be uncomfort- 
able and dangerous neighbors ; but Professor Smith 
assures us that on the whole they probably do more 
good than harm. He says, for instance, that " were 
all insect scavengers removed at one time and all 
dead animal and vegetable material left to other 
decays, the foulness and noxious odors that would 
be thus let loose are beyond all description." As 
an example of their usefulness in fertilizing plants, 
he gives the history of fig-growing in Southern Cal- 
ifornia, and shows how " a new industry, absolutely 
depending upon a minute hymenopterous insect, was 
finally established on a firm and scientific basis." 
Of the family of insects, he says in his preface: 
" Their presence or absence may make all the dif- 
ference between sickness and health, irritation and 
comfort, poverty or wealth, or, on the other hand, 
wealth and poverty." The service which this book 
renders in giving us accurate and easily available 
knowledge on this little-understood subject is ines- 
timable. 

It may seem a curious thing that a 
scholar and college professor like Mr. 
Harry Thurston Peck should be so 
prone to leave his academic labors in Latin to exhibit 
himself to the reading public in the guise of a student 
of anything else. His latest contribution to the book- 
sellers is " Studies in Several Literatures " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The "studies "are chiefly from 
English, American, and French literature, and being 
lightly and plausibly set forth they may serve to 
beguile an otherwise idle hour at a summer resort. 
If, however, we desire to estimate them more seri- 
ously, it will be enough to read the essay on Emerson. 
Emerson and Longfellow, Professor Peck thinks, are 
the greatest American authors, or at least the two 



Rummages 
in several 
literatures. 



who are surest of surviving; and of the two, he 
thinks Emerson the greater, because while Long- 
fellow has " beauty and fitness of form " Emerson 
has " intellectual quality." We may suppose of the 
latter, then, that he is worth serious effort. But if 
we look to see what Professor Peck has to say on 
Emerson's intellectuality, we find only that Emerson 
has no system of philosophy, that he is a fountain of 
isolated thought, that he was a champion of intel- 
lectual freedom, that he gave supreme devotion to 
the doctrine of an intense individualism, and that he 
teaches in aphorisms. Now as these are matters that 
everyone is familiar with who has read a text-book 
of literature, we may ask how a man could proceed 
to a study of Emerson knowing less, and if he gained 
no more what could be the nature of his study ? If 
we may judge from these " studies," Professor Peck 
is not a student in the ordinary sense : he is one 
who picks up commonplaces about people and things, 
and expresses them in a smart and chirpy style which 
furnishes his readers a moderate degree of entertain- 
ment. But the knack of using a breezy style for 
giving distinction to the commonplace, of saying dis- 
putable things in such a cock-sure way, is one that 
may be overworked; and the reader comes to feel that 
Professor Peck does push this dependence pretty far. 



. ,. . Dr. Charles F. Johnson's "Shake- 

A guide to ••«...» m 1 \ 

Shakespearian speare and his Critics (Houghton) 
criticism. j s a mos t useful book — a veritable 

literary Baedeker. It attempts to outline the entire 
field of Shakespearean criticism, both textual and 
literary, — British, American, and foreign. No 
previous work has tried to cover this wide field. 
The judgments of Professor Johnson upon the vari- 
ous critics are well considered. His own incidental 
comments upon the many questions that arise are 
penetrating and valuable, and are choicely expressed. 
The book is evidently the ripe fruit of many years 
of study and reflection. It seems strange, however, 
that although the work gives much space to Amer- 
icans the name of Henry N. Hudson is not men- 
tioned. In accuracy, and in some of the details of 
book-making, the work is faulty. Many titles are 
incorrect or inadequate; e.g., "the Stationer's Book," 
" the New Shakespearean Society." That an emenda- 
tion of Rowe (p. 88) and a reading of a First Quarto 
(p. 90J should be attributed to Pope, is perhaps 
pardonable. Graver mistakes are : the statement 
that " Lear is carried from Leicester to Dover "; the 
omission of " Love's Labour's Won " from Meres's 
list of Shakespeare's plays (1598) ; and the giving 
of the name William Kyd to the supposed author of 
the lost play of " Hamlet." On page 52 a quotation 
from Kipling is dreadfully mangled. A chief defect 
in the book is that the paragraphs cited from the 
critics and the many passages quoted from Shake- 
speare himself are not located. The latter are often 
cited because containing typical emendations. Since 
the information given by Professor Johnson in these 
cases is necessarily scanty, and is not always entirely

accurate, the failure to give exact references is unfor- 
tunate. In spite of its defects, the book is cordially 
commended as a helpful guide to the more important 
literature concerning Shakespeare. 

illuminating To deliver the Lane Lectures for 
chapter* on old 1908, Harvard University was for- 
Greek hutorian*. tuna te enough to secure Dr. J. B. 
Bury, Regius Professor of History in the University 
of Cambridge. The lecturer chose as his general 
theme u The Ancient Greek Historians "; and the 
addresses are now published in an interesting vol- 
ume (Macmillan). Long ago Professor Bury estab- 
lished a reputation for penetrating criticism and 
genuine historical acumen, as well as for felicity of 
presentation ; and all these qualities are manifest in 
the present work. His pen passes illuminatingly 
from " The Rise of Greek History " to the later 
historians and u The Influence of Greek on Roman 
Historiography." The least satisfactory pages are 
those dealing with Roman writers ; and the lectures 
as printed would have been little poorer if these had 
been omitted. The most interesting chapters are 
probably the two on Thucydides, where Professor 
Bury is at his best. The index is adequate, and the 
bibliography nearly so, although the latter might have 
been enlarged without including negligible studies. 
The volume is appropriately dedicated to Mr. Gar- 
diner M. Lane, '* who founded the lectureship some 
years ago in the interests of humanistic study." 
Those of us who have followed Professor Bury's 
writings, and have also happened to hear him speak, 
must envy his auditors at Harvard as we turn these 
pages. The next best thing for those who are inter- 
ested in the subject will be to read the book. 



Mr. Thomas Cooper DeLeon, prolific 
2£2££X auth ° r "d P%wright, well known 

for his "Confederate Memories," his 
" Four Years in Rebel Capitals," and his " Life of 
General Joseph Wheeler," has produced another 
book of Southern souvenirs and character sketches 
entitled u Belles. Beaux, and Brains of the 60's " 
(Dillingham). Born in South Carolina, four years 
in the Confederate service, and now a resident of 
Mobile, the author is a thorough Southerner, u dyed 
in the wool" and his chatty and attractive volume 
proves it unequivocally. In his very first chapter, 
in a characteristic protest against Mrs. Stowe's un- 
preposessing picture of the slaveholder, it is pointed 
out that the brutality toward the negro detailed in 
•• L ncle Tom's Cabin " is all committed by a Yankee 
overseer. Life and society in Richmond, Washington, 
and elsewhere in the lower latitudes of our broad 
land, are recalled with many illustrative anecdotes 
and references to historic events and famous char- 
acters. The portraits scattered through the volume 
are almost beyond counting, and help to vitalize 
these pages from a vanished past. The book will 
interest especially those older readers of Southern 
antecedents who are fond of recalling good old times 
" before the war." 



Leaves from 
the life of a 
Turkish lady 



" Haremlik " (Houghton ) is the work 
of Demetra Vaka, now Mrs. Kenneth 
Brown, a native of Constantinople 
and for a long time a resident in Turkey. We are 
told that the book is not fiction, although the Fore- 
word troubles the reader somewhat by confessing 
that "there has been some rearranging of facts." 
Mrs. Brown visited Constantinople again after six 
years in this country, and found her girl friends pro- 
vided — for the most part comfortably and happily 
provided — with a fraction of a husband apiece. 
She claims to furnish an impartial account of the 
working of a system which, like other systems, is 
compounded of good and evil ; but her own conclu- 
sion, both as to the merits of what she saw and the 
I manner in which nations and individuals should be 
allowed to find their way to the light, is evidently 
expressed in her word to the Turkish " suffragettes " : 
'• Since you do not like your system, — although it 
seems to me admirable on the whole, — it is only 
right that you should be allowed to live your lives 
as you want to. Only, you must go about it in a 
sensible way, and take into consideration the others 
who are involved in it" Whatever may be the 
book's value as documentary evidence for the sociol- 
ogist, — and it is probably not impersonal enough or 
general enough to give it a great deal of value in 
that direction, — it is stirringly written, and two or 
three little incidents of childhood companionships, in 
particular, are told almost as prettily as anything of 
' the kind in literature. 



From the industrious pen of the Rev. 
oJthl'Za^me. P - H - Litchfield there has appeared 

a good-sized volume of clerical anec- 
dotes and legend and history, under the attractive 
title, ■ The Old-time Parson " (E. P. Dutton & Co.). 
The same author issued not long ago a well-received 
work on " The Parish Clerk," and now deems it 
" only fair that the occupant of the higher tier of the 
' three-decker ' should share his honour." A friend 
of the writer placed at his disposal "a manuscript 
collection of clerical stories " which he had been get- 
ting together for many years. Consequently there 
is no lack of illustrative anecdote in the book ; and as 
clerical wit is proverbially of good quality, the volume 
yields abundant entertainment. The Saxon parson 
and the mediaeval parson have each a chapter, neces- 
sarily somewhat short, to themselves. Chaucer's 
u poor parson of a town " is of course presented in 
the poet's own descriptive verse, and " Piers Plow- 
man" is made to furnish a pertinent passage. But 
the chapter on " The Parson in Literature " might 
easily have been extended to include more of the 
familiar pulpit-founders of fiction. Charlotte Bronte, 
for example, has pictured the country curate with 
a pitiless fidelity that should not be passed over. 
Among the witty parsons. Dr. South and Bishop Wil- 
berforce figure conspicuously, and Robert Stephen 
Hawker fails not to appear among the eccentric 
parsons. Numerous portraits and other illustrations 
contribute their share of interest to the volume.

Transformation, From the facts of paleontology comes 
in the world of the evidence which in the last analysis 
animal life. most definitely and cogently attests 
that in the history of the living things which people 
the earth there has been an organic evolution or 
transformation. A hook which marshals the data 
of paleontology and shows their bearing on the prob- 
lems of evolution is particularly timely in the year 
when all over the world men are doing honor to 
the memory of Darwin. Such a book is M. Charles 
Depe'ret's " Transformation of the Animal World," 
the latest addition to the "International Scientific 
Series" ( Appleton) . In these days when the dominant 
trend in the investigation of evolution problems is to 
apply the experimental method, it is refreshing to be 
brought back once in a while to the literally as well 
as metaphorically solid evolutionary record afforded 
by the fossils. Broadly speaking, the aim of the 
present book may be said to be to show, on the 
basis of the paleontological data now in hand, 
the phyletic history of the larger groups of animals 
existing to-day. Doing this furnishes the occasion 
for discussing the probable methods through which 
the observed transformation of animals may be held 
to have occurred, and also for outlining briefly the 
history of opinion on these points. Occasionally the 
translator (F. Legge) slips up on a technical detail, 
but in general the style is accurate and pleasing. 

It was high time that someone wrote 
USSSSSt an out-door book for Midsummer, 

and the only defect in Mr. Winthrop 
Packard's "Wild Pastures" (Small, Maynard & Co.) 
is that the title does not indicate the scope and' 
character of the work. Somewhere in his Eastern 
Massachusetts pasture Mr. Packard has discovered 
a spring of words that express, as nearly as it would 
seem that words can express, the magic of the 
" Arabian days " of June, July, and August. Here 
where the " cosmos of the wild has wiped out that 
curious chaos which we call civilization " he waylays 
the dawn of June mornings and " stalks " the wild 
grape whose fragrance makes him " dream of pipes 
of Pan playing in the morning of the world, while 
all the wonder creatures of the old Greek myths 
dance in rhythm and sing in soft undertones, and 
the riot of young life bubbles within them." Beside 
the pasture brook in the hot summer days he gets 
glimpses of the life of the rock-bass and horn-pout, 
and in the moonlight nights he watches the witch 
faces on the hazel-bushes " detach themselves from 
the limbs, put on their red caps and sail off across 
the great yellow disk " of the full moon. He watches 
the bluebirds and tanagers with as much interest in 
their moulting as he has taken in their nesting, and 
is acquainted with the personnel and separate instru- 
ments of the frog-pond orchestra. Through the long 
summer drought he sees how there is " in all the 
pasture people a certain puritanical sternness of de- 
meanor, a set holding-fast to the narrowing good of 
life, a tightening of the muscles that are weary with 
a long strain but may not for the good of the soul 



loose their firm grip," until the first Fall rain releases 
them from their suffering. The book is satisfactory 
for not attempting too much, and accomplishing 
what it attempts delicately and well. A few draw- 
ings by Mr. Copeland help the reader to visualize 
the text. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" A Pocket Lexicon and Concordance to the Temple 
Shakespeare " (Macmillan) supplements that admirable 
edition in a very useful way, besides being independently 
valuable as an aid to the Shakespearian student. It gives 
us a great deal of matter compressed within the limits of 
a volume that is in the strictest sense pocketable. 

" The Statesman's Year Book " for 1909, edited by 
Messrs. J. Scott Keltie and I. P. A. Renwick, is pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. This is the forty-sixth 
annual issue of this invaluable book of reference. A 
few economies of space have been effected, and there 
are matters of special interest concerning the Belgian 
annexation of the Congo, the Constitution of Turkey, 
and new political conditions in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Sweden, 
Persia, and China. An important addition is found in 
the section devoted to the Hague Tribunal. 

" Some Hidden Sources of Fiction," by Mr. Benjamin 
Matthias Nead, is a small volume printed for private 
circulation by Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. It 
turns out to be, after a few introductory paragraphs, a 
tracing of the indebtedness of Sir Gilbert Parker, in 
his " Seats of the Mighty," to the " Memoirs of Major 
Robert Stabo, of the Virginia Regiment," published in 
Pittsburg in 1854. A clear case of borrowing is made 
out, and it would seem that the novelist might appro- 
priately have acknowledged the source of so many of 
the incidents of his book. 

Volume II. of "Islandica," edited by Mr. George 
William Harris, and published by the Cornell University 
Library, consists of a bibliography of " The Northmen 
in America," prepared, mainly upon the basis of the 
Fiske collection of Icelandic literature, by Mr. Halldor 
Hermannsson. Many of the titles are annotated, and 
the work is a valuable guide to the literature of the sub- 
ject. Much fantastic rubbish is found in this catalogue, 
which admits vain speculations about Norumbega and 
the old English mill at Newport to the company of 
serious scientific discussions; but it is all very properly 
grist for the bibliographer, even if it illustrates nothing 
more than " a prodigious play of the imagination, un- 
restrained by any knowledge of the subject."

Dr. William Edgar Geil, who has just returned from 
his latest journey of exploration, is said to be the first

miles) of China's stupendous fortifications. The com- 
plete journey is described in his forthcoming book, 
" The Great Wall of China," announced by the Sturgia 
& Walton Co. 

F. Marion Crawford's last novel " The New Gover- 
ness," is described as a story of English country life, 
and the heroine is a charming girl who masquerades as 
an ugly, deformed, and shy school-room dragon. It is 
stated that Mr. Crawford left also the MS. of another

novel, as well as that of a " History of the Papacy in 
the Nineteenth Century." The first volume of a three- 
volume " History of Rome in the Middle Ages," in which 
he had collaborated with Professor Tomassetti, is now 
in type. 

Simultaneous with the news of the arrival of Lieu- 
tenant Ernest H. Shackleton in London *came the 
announcement that his book, giving a full account of 
his eventful Antarctic expedition of 1907-9, would be 
published in November by J. B. Lippincott Company. It 
will be issued in two crown quarto volumes, and illus- 
strated with color plates and reproductions from photo- 
graphs taken by the author. 

As a forthcoming instalment in their " Shakespeare 
Library," Messrs. Duffield & Co. will publish early in 
the Fall " The Shakespeare Allusion Book," in two 
octavo volumes. The work will contain all known 
references, or allusions, to Shakespeare and his plays 
before the close of the seventeenth century. For the 
first time these " allusions," originally collected by Dr. 
Ingleby, Miss L. Toulmin Smith, and Dr. Furnivall, will 
be arranged in chronological order and supplemented 
with explanatory notes. 

Professor Frederick Starr, the anthropologist and 
lecturer at the University of Chicago, much of whose 
time is spent in travel and researches in foreign lands, 
will leave early in September for another extended trip 
to Japan, where, with the aid of native assistants, he 
will undertake on a large scale the task of investigating 
and collecting the valuable anthropological, ethnograph- 
ical, and archieological material contained in Japanese 
books — a mass of important matter almost unknown 
and inaccessible to the outside world. An expert pho- 
tographer will be a member of the party, with whose 
aid Professor Starr expects to enlarge our knowledge 
of present-day Japan by making some complete photo- 
graphic records of its scenery, life, arts and industries, 
architecture, etc. 

One of the most important and interesting of the 
autumn books will be the " Autobiography of Henry M. 
Stanley," edited by Lady Stanley, for which Houghton 
Mifflin Co. have secured the American edition. A part 
of Stanley's notable and adventurous career is told in 
his famous book, " Through Darkest Africa"; but here 
for the first time in his own words we have the com- 
plete story of his life, — his youth in America, his service 
and experiences in the Civil War, his return to England, 
his early dreams and ambitions, with the narrative of 
their complete fulfillment. We also have for the first 
time told in his Autobiography and the supplementary 
narrative, which is made up from his letters, the inner 
history of many important events and episodes which 
have not hitherto been made public.

asked such questions as ' What is Truth ? ' * What is Man's mission on

WM. ALLEN 

WHITE'S 
NEW NOVEL 



" Possessing a thorough knowledge and an acute power of under- 
standing, Mr. White is able to write vigorously and refreshingly 
and truthfully ... a novel that is worth reading and discussion 
and thinking about." — Boston Transcript. 

"An American novel, home-grown in home soil, vital with 
homely American motives, and fragrant with homely American 
memories, Mr. White has certainly achieved." — N. Y. Times. 

''It pulsates with humor, interest, passionate love, adventure, 
pathos — every page is woven with threads of human nature, 
life as we know it, life as it is, and above it all a spirit of right- 
eousness, true piety, and heroic patriotism. These inspire the 
author's genius and fine literary quality, thrilling the reader with 
tenderest emotion and holding to the end his unflagging, absorb- 
ing interest." — The Public Ledger (Philadelphia). 

"It gives us glimpses into the heart of a people, moulding its 
destiny in no academic fashion, but through the ups and downs 
of the everyday struggle for existence. The soil of the Middle 
West is in this book. ... It is a vivid picture Mr. White paints 
— real, exciting, sympathetic, often amusing and as often touch- 
ing. . . . Mr. White has studied American life from the inside 
and has made a novel out of it possessing uncommon vitality and 
interest." — New York Tribune. 

" Mr. White has written a big and satisfying book made up of 
the elements of American life as we know them — the familiar 
humor, sorrows, ambitions, crimes, and sacrifices, revealed to 
us with peculiar freshness and vigor in the multitude of human 
actions and by the crowd of delightful people who fill his four 
hundred odd pages. . . . For its sheer truth it deserves a high 
place among the novels that deal with American life. No recent 
American novel save one has sought to cover so broad a canvas, 
or has created so strong an impression of ambition and of sin- 
cerity." — Chicago Evening Post. 



A CERTAIN RICH MAN 

"A novel that deserves to be called great and to be placed in the front rank of American 
literature. For it is American from beginning to end and saturated with the old 
American spirit that will persist and that will redeem.'" — San FRANCISCO ARGONAUT.

FIVE FEET OF CULTURE. 



The story of the parvenu who builds a pala- 
tial home, finds that a library with so many feet 
of shelving is included in the specifications, and 
orders it to be filled with books, has often been 
imagined. It is somewhat worn, this jest of 
stocking a library by linear measurement, but 
it is fairly expressive of the bewildered state of 
mind of a person who accepts "the library" 
as one of the necessary adjuncts of the well- 
appointed household, and who is desirous that 
the appearance of culture shall not be lacking 
in his establishment. And in fact, the man 
who has been too busy in acquiring wealth to 
become a reader might easily do worse than get 
his bookish furniture in this way. An order like 
this, placed in the hands of a library expert, or 
a really intelligent bookseller (for such there 
are), might have unanticipated consequences ; it 
might open real resources of thought to the owner, 
hitherto untravelled in the world of books, or 
it might prove unexpectedly helpful in shaping 
the minds of the children who are growing up 
in the house. Better far such a selection as this 
than any the householder would be likely to 
make for himself ; immeasurably better than 
any that would result from heeding the pleas of 
the wily book-agent, with his fraudulent editions 
de luxe and his subscription sets of standard 
authors. That way lies despair, not so much for 
the deluded victim as for the friends who wish 
him well and would gladly give him of their 
counsel. 

A recent instance of the reduction of literary 
culture to linear terms is provided by Dr. Eliot's 
widely-discussed selection of books for a five- 
foot shelf. This is a matter of much human 
concern ; for it affects, not the plutocrat in his 
palace, but the toiler in his hovel — or his flat, 
to use the modern equivalent. Even the most 
modest example of that ingenious device for 
cellular housing will afford five feet of shelf- 
room somewhere, and the half -hundred books 
that fill it will be so en evidence that a good 
deal depends upon what kind of books they are. 
TYTien Dr. Eliot made out his list, he probably 
attempted nothing more than to indicate, from 
his ripe educational experience, the sort of books 



84

[August 16, 



that should be kept near at hand by any person 
who really wished to come in contact with the 
best that had been thought and said in the world. 
It was a simple and helpful suggestion, similar 
to many others of its kind, made without a touch 
of dogmatism or intellectual arrogance. Doubt- 
less the last thing in the world that Dr. Eliot 
meant to do was to sit in judgment upon the 
world's literature, or to winnow the wheat from 
the chaff. His was no selection of the " hun- 
dred best books," but merely the naming of 
a few that would be serviceable to the needs 
of the average serious reader. Returning to 
our metaphor, he picked up, almost at ran- 
dom, a handful of the grains of wheat, know- 
ing full well that many other handfuls equally 
nutritive might be collected from the threshing- 
floor. 

We should not have thought of discussing 
so trifling a matter were it not for the wide- 
spread interest and extraordinary comment it 
has evoked. The summer, as is well known, is 
the " silly season "in journalism, and it certainly 
has been improved to the utmost in the discus- 
sion of Dr. Eliot's list. Some writers have 
worked themselves up to a state of unwholesome 
excitement over it, and have called it " amazing," 
" astonishing," " ridiculous," " preposterous," 
and such-like names. Editors and professors 
and clergymen have taken its compiler to task 
and belabored him in a manner that must have 
excited the venerable Doctor's wondering sur- 
prise. One indignant Cantabrigian truculently 
wants to know by what authority the books listed 
are announced for re-publication under the style 
of " Harvard Classics " — as if " Harvard " were 
not a name that any tradesman in a free country 
might apply to a new soap, or a new breakfast 
food, or a new automobile ! 

This disturbance in celestial souls may be 
accounted for partly by the hot weather, and 
partly by the same sort of feeling that makes 
every man sure that he can poke an open fire 
better than anybody else, or concoct a more appe- 
tizing cocktail. Of course every reader knows, 
deep down in his own heart, that when it comes 
to making a list of the best books, he is the 
only one really competent to do it. Those who 
remember the discussion of Sir John Lubbock's 
list, twenty-five years ago, will recall many 
amusing examples of this species of self-conceit. 
It is the same with anthologies ; and no compiler 
of a volume of selected poems ever completely 
satisfied any reader but himself. Schopenhauer 
tells us of a philosopher whose only weakness was 



that he considered every one of his own beliefs 
to belong to the store of intuitive knowledge 
possessed by the entire human race. Dr. Eliot's 
list claims no more than exceptional fitness to 
keep the reader in line with what is normal and 
enduring in literature. Other lists, equally 
sound in principle and helpful in use, might 
easily be put together. It is no reflection on 
Shakespeare and the Bible to find them missing 
in the present case, — it simply means that some 
things may be taken for granted. Nor does the 
inclusion of some work in a special category — 
like " The Wealth of Nations," or " Dr. Faustus," 
or " Becket," — mean that other works in these 
categories are discriminated against. And we 
can see no vital necessity for mirth or satirical 
comment in the fact that attention is drawn to 
such obscure writers as John Woolman and 
William Penn. Those who know and cherish 
these writers will understand ; those who are 
brought to make their acquaintance will be 
grateful. 

Any suggestion that tends to encourage the 
reading of good books deserves praise. That 
the books in Dr. Eliot's list are good books will 
hardly be denied ; if the present year of grace 
produces any that will be reckoned, a century 
hence, to be deserving of inclusion in such a list, 
it will be beyond most years distinguished by that 
fact. All the galvanism of advertisement and 
puffery cannot keep a book alive if the vital prin- 
ciple is not in it. If we prefer, to take Ruskin's 
comparison, the society of stable-boys to the 
society of kings, we may have it a-plenty ; but 
we may instead entertain royal guests if we 
choose, and they await our bidding to " give us 
manners, virtue, freedom, power." There is also 
much to be said for Dr. Eliot's counsel concern- 
ing the reading of good books. Their contents 
are not readily assimilated, and every hour spent 
over their pages requires several other hours 
of inward meditation for its proper intellectual 
fruition. We see nothing but a plain statement 
of simple truth in the declaration that a few 
minutes given each day to the reading of the 
books named, or of others that have been 
similarly tested by time, will in the course of 
years provide the essentials of a liberal education. 
There is no such thing as liberal education in 
the abstract, and no universal prescription will 
secure it ; but every individual may acquire by 
his own efforts the particular liberal education 
which answers to his individual needs, and Dr. 
Eliot's recommendation is elastic enough to cover 
an infinite variety of cases.

A MAN FOR WHOM " WE HA VE A 
KINDNESS." 



It is not only by such losses to the world of 
letters as were wrought by the recent deaths of 
Swinburne and Meredith that we of to-day are 
reminded how close we yet stand to that golden hun- 
dred years of British literature which opened with 
Burns and closed with Tennyson. Every month of 
this present twelve has brought some name to put us 
in mind of one or another of the great ones of that 
just-closed era of splendor ; and now August calls 
back one who markedly was of that brilliant group 
which dominated the last century's earlier days. On 
the twenty-eighth of this month, a short fifty years 
ago, Leigh Hunt died at Putney — where the singer 
of the M Atlanta in Calydon " and B Laus Veneris " 
breathed his last, only yesterday, as it seems. To 
recall Hunt's life, however cursorily, is to look again 
along the half-happy, half-wretched, wholly-careless 
weeks and months of one who played, if a minor, 
yet a considerable part in the breaking down of the 
formalism which had come to rule eighteenth-century 
verse. Keats, as much as any other, shattered for 
all time the poetic fetters cast by Pope and his 
fellows; and Keats was influenced in his work by 
none more than by Leigh Hunt. Grant that Hunt's 
own lines must be said to ,; trot smartly, rather than 
fly." yet to him directly is due not a little of the 
freedom and lusciousness of •• Endymion," — as was 
recognised by the surly old H Quarterly Review " 
when it first noticed that poem and called its author 
merelv " a neophite of the writer of the • Story of 
Rimini.' " 

" To know Hunt was to hold him in reverence 
and in love," wrote Lamb. u He is one of those 
happy souls who are the salt of the earth," was the 
tribute paid by Shelley, from whose melodious lips 
fell also the briefer phrase, perhaps best descriptive 
of the man, u He is constitutionally gay." *' We have 
a kindness for Mr. Leigh Hunt," was the more 
dignified and eminently characteristic way in which 
Macaulay saw fit to state a truth that is still a 
truth; and Hawthorne, Emerson, even Carlyle, have 
preached to the same text. In brief. Hunt was such 
an one as it is good for a work-a-day world to pause 
and call up before its busy eye?. The part he played 
in the literature of his time was quite important 
enough to warrant one in using it now as an excuse 
to think once more of a man of real charm ; amusing 
at times, pitiable at others, but first and last to be 
regarded only with a warm and tolerant affection. 
In every word he wrote he stands forth the exponent 
of a cheery, sentimental optimism ; in every line he 
penned he poses the personification of some hoped- 
for future when nobody will be damned or in debt, — 
when everything will be but refined beer and skittles. 

Born in a London suburb, October 19, 1784, he 
was christened James Henry Leigh, though the first 
two names were so promptly dropped as to be now 
forgotten. His father was a decayed planter of 



Barbadoes, who, while studying in Philadelphia, 
married one of the Shewells ; the son showing many 
a trace of the happy-go-lucky "West Indian blood, 
and none at all of the methodical, thrifty little 
Quakeress. The boy was nothing if not impression- 
able. He himself tells the story of the deep effect 
made upon him by some early memory of the word 
" damn." He longed to voice the syllable and so 
make it all his own ; and he tells how, a full fort- 
night after the thought had first lodged in his little 
head, he retired to the safe solitude of the back yard, 
where two or three several times he indulged himself 
in the round-mouthed pleasure of the word, and then, 
for weeks to come, whenever an aunt or elderly friend 
would pat him on the head with praise of this or that, 
he would torture himself with the secret accusation, 
" They little think that I 'm the boy who said damn! " 

Young Hunt followed Lamb and Coleridge at the 
"Blue Coat School" (Christ's Hospital), studying 
there for the eight years between 1792 and 1800, 
and leaving this not attractive summary of the day's 
routine : 

" We rose to the call of a bell, at six in summer and seven 
in winter. . . . From breakfast we proceeded to school, where 
we remained till eleven, winter and summer, and then had 
an hour's play. Dinner took place at twelve. Afterward 
was a little play till one. when we went again to school, and 
remained till five in summer and four in winter. At six was 
the supper. We used to play after it in summer till eight. 
In winter we proceeded from supper to bed. . . . Our break- 
fast was bread (half of a three-penny-loaf) and water, for 
the beer was too bad to drink. For dinner we had the same 
quantity of bread, with meat only every other day. On the 
other days, we had a milk porridge, ludicrously thin, or rice- 
milk, which was better. For supper, we had a like piece of 
bread, with butter or cheese." 

This does not seem much on which to feed a 
Pegasus, yet young Hunt's was already cantering, 
for, a year after his graduation (he was then only 
sixteen) his father published for him a volume of his 
poems. The " Lyrical Ballads," issued three years 
earlier, had never " taken " so far as the reading 
public was concerned, and Sir Walter's " Lay of the 
Last Minstrel " was not to see types for four years 
to come ; " mouthy " Southey and Samuel Rogers, 
the latter more banker than poet, were at the moment 
dividing literary honors ; and so it happened that 
these very juvenile pieces of young Hunt's, imitations 
of Spenser and Thomson, Collins and Gray, ran 
through three editions, to an accompaniment of popu- 
larity which cannot but seem strange indeed to-day. 

A few years more, and the young man was con- 
tributing excellent dramatic and literary criticism to 
u The Traveller," a weekly owned and published by 
bis brother John, and soon succeeded first by u The 
News " and then " The Examiner," Leigh eventu- 
ally becoming editor as well as part proprietor of the 
last named. At this time, too, he married Marianne 
Kent. Their son Thornton, in the life of his father, 
has told us that she was the u reverse of handsome " 
and "wholly without accomplishments, "which might 
seem a seeking after truth with all filial feeling for- 
got if we did not have the testimony on the other 
side of no less an one than Thackeray to tell us that

Marianne had a pretty figure, fine eyes, and magni- 
ficent black hair, with the further information that 
" she had a strong bent for the plastic arts." 

These early years were given up wholly to u The 
Examiner," a daring sheet, strongly showing the 
influence which the French Revolution had exerted 
on English letters of the period. In 1812 it pub- 
lished an article on the Prince Regent, later George 
the Fourth, calling him " a fat Adonis of fifty," 
which was bad enough, but the paragraph went on 
to speak of the future king as " a violator of home 
ties," " a debaucher of the domestic hearth," " a 
companion of demireps," with other such phrases 
equally sure to demand " official " notice. The Hunts 
were arrested and brought to trial for libel, and, 
though defended by Lord Brougham, were sentenced 
to a fine of £500 and two years imprisonment. Leigh 
served his time in the Horsemonger Lane Goal, where 
he promptly and surely became the fashion of " the 
Opposition " of the time. The great Bentham him- 
self came out to play shuttlecock ; while Hazlitt and 
Byron, Moore and Lamb, Shelley and Keats, called 
almost daily, till the whole period, strangely enough, 
stood to the prisoner as one of the happiest he had 
known or was to know. His family was permitted 
to be with him ; he was allowed a suit of rooms 
with a private garden ; his parlor was re-papered 
for him in a trellised design with blue sky for a ceil- 
ing ; his books, his busts, and his piano were installed 
for his greater comfort ; and, above all else, his board 
and lodging was being cared for by a presumably 
outraged government. For once at least Leigh Hunt 
was pestered with no housekeeping cares. " The 
Story of Rimini," which he wrote at this time, and 
which was published soon after his release, was, not 
unnaturally, the best thing he had yet done. Cer- 
tainly it gave him an acknowledged stand among the 
writers of the day, whilst its greatest praise is that it 
so largely influenced both Keats and Shelley. 

The five years following his release were devoted 
in the main to his work for " The Indicator," a 
weekly not dissimilar from "The Examiner" (though 
seldom dabbling in politics), for which Hunt wrote 
the best of his essays. They were always cheerful, 
often fanciful, — " Some Thoughts on Sleep " being 
a typical as well as a delightful example. But when 
they touched upon literary criticism, one sees that 
the author of " Stories of the Italian Poets " is not 
always to be trusted, in spite of those two sound 
volumes. Hunt loved literature passionately and 
humbly; his best friends were books rather than 
men ; and yet the major part of his criticism is dis- 
tinctly of a hasty and temporary sort. He could, 
for instance, gush over Thomas Moore while voicing 
a disgust for Landor ; he conscientiously placed 
Ariosto on a par with Milton, and thought Pulci the 
equal of Spenser. On the other hand, he was aptly 
accurate in calling the author of the " Faerie Queen " 
" the most luxurious " of English poets ; he saw 
through Rogers and Southey, and had the foresight 
to name Wordsworth as the chief poet of his age. 

During this period of his life, Hunt was an 



intimate at the Countess of Blessington's salon at 
Gore House, where the Albert Hall now stands, till 
he permitted his too-ready pen to speak of his hostess 
as '• a Venus grown fat," after which, quite naturally, 
her famous home no longer opened its doors to him. 
Then (1821) he went out to Italy as a sort of literary 
attache to Byron, to whom he had dedicated his 
" Rimini," helping that " noble Lord " (along with 
Shelley and Hazlitt) to edit his short-lived "Liberal." 
Hazlitt soon ceased to write for the sheet ; Shelley 
was drowned ; and Byron and Hunt quarrelled, the 
latter returning to England (with Mrs. Hunt and 
the many little Hunts) to write a particularly dis- 
agreeable and wholly uncalled-for book. 

The rest of Hunt's days were spent in or near 
London. He was at Highgate for a time, with its 
memories of Coleridge ; at Epsom and at Brompton, 
at Kensington and at Chelsea. With Kensington 
his name is inevitably and always associated through 
"An Old Court Suburb," which must share with 
"Imagination and Fancy " and "The Italian Poets " 
the title of his best work. In Chelsea, where he 
lived from 1833 to 1840, Hunt is a figure not soon 
to be forgotten. The little house at No. 10, Upper 
Cheyne Row, where Leigh and Marianne spent their 
seven years of "tinkerdom," — half in rapture at 
the smell of the lime trees, half in terror as every 
knock at the door suggested duns and bailiffs, — lias 
been described by their neighbor Carlyle in a para- 
graph all but classic. Who cannot see the chairs in 
that strange parlor halting in their mad hornpipe as 
the sage enters, with the gypsy-like children playing 
about in the littered room amongst last week's papers 
and the morning's breakfast fragments ! Who can- 
not figure the host, in his tattered flowered dressing 
gown, offering the caller the one sound-looking chair 
of all and seating himself on a window-sill, to dis- 
course, without apology, on literature and the rights 
of man ! " Pitiable and lovable," truly ; to be used 
"kindly, but with discretion." 

Yet another picture of the man at this time comes 
in a story of Mr. Smith, the publisher, who tells of 
an early morning call which he received from the 
much-disturbed Mr. Hunt. The night before, Smith 
had paid him for the best of a year's work, the bank 
notes totalling £1000. Now the author came to ex- 
plain that these precious notes, left trustingly in the 
rubbish on the parlor table, had been burned by 
Marianne in the only house-cleaning in that estab- 
lishment of which there is record. Could they pos- 
sibly be replaced ? was the anxious question ; and as 
it was put, the questioner gesticulated wildly with 
a tiny statue of a naked Psyche, which, in spite 
of his perturbation and threatened poverty, he had 
bought from a street peddler on his way to the 
office. Mr. Smith thought the matter might be 
untangled at the Bank of England, as he had for- 
tunately retained a memorandum of the numbers 
of the notes ; and together the two went down into 
the City. There they were shown into a back room 
in the solemn and unsightly home where "the old 
lady of Threadneedle Street " lives, and seated

themselves in the silent presence of three venerahle 
clerks, bending over great ledgers on a green baize- 
covered table. The only light in the room came 
from a glazed skylight above ; it was silent save for 
the scratching of those three pens, — all dreadfully 
different from anything to which Hunt had been 
used. He stood it as long as he could, and then, 
slipping quickly across to the table and laying a 
heavy hand on the shoulder of the nearest clerk, he 
asked, " And this is the Bank of England ? And do 
you mean to tell me that you sit here all day long, 
writing with that nasty pen in that horrid old book, 
and never see the blue sky or hear the birds ? " And 
then Smith captured the long-haired, wild-eyed man 
who had been waving that naked goddess before the 
startled eyes of the prosy employee. Does not 
the whole story eloquently suggest not only Hunt 
the impracticable visionary, but also that untidy, 
careless Marianne, who was forever borrowing this 
and that and the other from the Carlyles around the 
corner? The best single stanza Hunt ever wrote, 
••Jennie Kissed Me," a very masterpiece of trifling, 
bears witness to the same humorously pitiful stories ; 
for " Jennie " was Jane Carlyle, and the chances are 
at least even that she kissed the author because he 
was at last bringing back some of the many articles 
which his wife had borrowed. 

" Jennie kiss'd me when we met, 

Jumping from the chair she sat in ; 
Time, you thief, who love to get 

Sweets into your list, put that in. 
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad; 

i at health and wealth have miss'd me ; 
Say I'm growing old. but add — 
Jenny kiss'd me ! " 

Hunt died on the 28th of August, 1859, "just 
exhausted." In view of Saintsbury's statement that 
there are not in all of his work twenty consecutive 
good pages, one may accept the dictum that he was 
%i a genius in spots"; if the phrase may be per- 
mitted, a not inaccurate idea of his work may be 
gathered from the Wall Street term that he was 
•• too extended." He wrote two religious books, and 
attempted an historical novel, "Sir Ralph Echer"; 
he tried his hand at some half-dozen dramas, only 
one of which. •• A Legend of Florence," an attempt 
in the Elizabethan manner, was acted ; while the 
bulk of his work, setting aside the poems, can be 
best described as miscellaneous casual essays and 
critical articles. 

" He is a devilish good one," said ByTon of Hunt, 
" quaint here and there, but with the sub-stratum of 
originality and with poetry about it that will stand 
the test." This poetry has not stood the test — 
though •• Jennie Kissed Me," u The Glove and the 
Lions," u Abou Ben Adhem," and the sonnet on 
the Nile, are exceptions to the statement. The brief 
stanzas which tell the pregnant story of the oriental 
dreamer not only show Hunt's high talent for 
epigram, but are real poetry ; while his finest and 
most famous line. *• The laughing queen that caught 
the world's great hands," is not only the best nine- 
word description of Cleopatra, but is embodied in 



fourteen lines justly held superior to the sonnets on 
the same subject written in competition with it by 
Keats and Shelley. Perhaps three other fragments 
of his verse may be included with these as of per- 
manent worth. One is the sonnet on u The Cricket 
and the Grasshopper," also composed during the 
Horsemonger Goal days in friendly rivalry with 
Keats ; the final six lines of a sonnet-sequence on 
•• The Man and the Fish "; and the poppy stanzas 
in his u Song and Chorus of the Flowers." In the 
second case. Hunt achieves what is both Grecian 
and Jacobian in the lines : 

•' Man's life is warm, glad, sad, 'twixt love and graves, 
Boundless in hope, honoured with pangs austere, 
Heaven-gazing ; and his angel-wings he craves : 
The fish is swift, small-needing, vague yet clear, 
A cold, sweet, silver life, wrapp'd in round waves, 
Quicken'd with touches of transporting fear." 

The stanzas in which the poppies tell their story, too 
little known, are worth quoting entire. 

" We are slumb'rous poppies, 

Lords of Lethe downs, 
Some awake and some asleep, 

Sleeping in their crowns. 
What perchance our dreams may know, 
Let our serious beauty show. 

" Central depth of purple, 

Leaves more bright than rose, 
Who shall tell what brightest thought 

Out of darkness grows ? 
Who, through what funereal pain, 
Souls to love and peace attain '? 

•' Visions aye are on us, 

Unto eyes of power, 
Pluto's always-setting sun, 

And Proserpine's bower ; 
There, like bees, the pale souls come 
For our drink with drowsy hum. 

"• Taste, ye mortals, also ; 
Milky-hearted, we ; 
Taste, but with a reverent care ; 

Active, patient be. 
Too much gladness brings to gloom 
Those who on the gods presume.'' 

Delightful at its best, Hunt's verse is trifling as 
a whole ; there is a '* feminine quality " about it, 
which, however pleasing at the moment, detracts 
from lasting strength. Sentiment too often merges 
into sentimentality ; mere prettiness too often sup- 
plants real beauty. 

Hunt was a bundle of contradictions. Widely 
read he was, yet was he no scholar. One may not 
actually term him a thinker, although now and again 
he voiced thoughts so sweet as to warrant Allingham 
in calling him an eglantine. At moments he showed 
unquestionably fine taste, but quite as often was he 
vulgar. His work again and again evidences that 
delicately light touch which counts for so much, but 
as like as not it would be employed on tedious sub- 
jects. Beyond all question, he was full of poetry ; 
equally beyond all question, his verse was full of 
faults. Invariably busy, he accomplished compara- 
tively little, because he could not accustom himself 
to what has well been called u the regular drudgery 
of miscellaneous writing." Finally, and perhaps 






88 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



as a necessary corollary to the last statement, while 
he made much money he yet appears the shining 
example of those men who " allow " their friends to 
help them out. In 1844 he received an annuity of 
$50 a month from the Shelleys ; three years later 
there came to him a Crown annuity of $1000 a 
year ; twice Charles Dickens gave benefits for him ; 
and yet he was always in debt. Considerable new 
light has been thrown upon the reasons for this 
chronic financial embarrassment, by some letters 
which have been published only this summer in 
London. The letters are written by Dr. Bird, who 
for many years was the family physician of the 
Hunts and intimately acquainted with their affairs. 
According to this authority, it was not so much 
Hunt's improvidence as his wife's extravagance and 
his good-natured indulgence that caused the trouble ; 
and this explanation seems to be accepted by those 
best qualified to judge. Some new letters of Charles 
Dickens have also lately been published, in which 
the novelist, while not disavowing that his character 
of " Harold Skimpole " had originally been drawn, 
in a way, from Hunt, disclaims any intention of 
portraying Hunt in an unfavorable light, and 
expresses the sincerest regret that he should have 
been instrumental in casting a shadow over his 
friend's good name. 

Somewhere in one of his delightful volumes, Dr. 
S. Weir Mitchell says that life holds for us no 
examinations at conveniently set intervals, when, as 
in the days of school and college, we may " catch 
up "; but however true this is of our own deeds and 
doings, there is a pleasant exception to be made to 
his statement through the growing custom of anni- 
versary commemorations. Busied as the presentrday 
world fitly is with its suffrage debates and stock 
decisions, its hardy gardens and Oriental problems, 
its child-raising and canal-digging, its prohibition 
campaigns and political crises, each year brings to its 
attention some names of the great ones of an often 
half-forgotten yesterday, asking a monument for 
one, a new " Complete Works " for another, possibly 
something approximating an international fair for 
a third, — and behold, under the agreeable fiction 
of modern progress we have gone back to re-read a 
page or two of the life of a generation more or less 
ancient from our Twentieth Century point of view. 
In that way we do " catch up," — review some early 
lessons, revive some dormant friendship. 

Nineteen hundred and nine has led us to a gener- 
ous share of just this, — with our mighty Lincoln, 
with that antithesis of his, John Calvin, with Darwin 
and Poe and Tennyson, and those two so different 
Doctors, the New England Holmes and the Old 
England Johnson ; and among the other and lesser 
ones, FitzGerald and Milnes and Kinglake, we may 
well give a leisurely hour to Leigh Hunt. No man 
of his literary era is harder to summarize than he, 
in a phrase or a page ; but neither is any other of 
his day more worth our affectionate recalling.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

Our debt to Oliver Wendell Holmes is not to 
be discharged by any display of centennial fireworks 
in the shape of birthday orations and magazine 
articles commemorative of the inimitable Autocrat. 
Those who knew him in life, or who have even seen 
him on the speaker's platform and listened to his 
graceful utterance, whether in prose or in verse, will 
cherish his memory and will know that if he had 
never lived American letters and American life 
would be to-day something different and poorer than 
they actually are. His regard for the polite formal- 
ities and elegancies, in conduct, in speech, and in 
writing, was a lesson to his ruder fellow-citizens, 
and one that we daily and hourly tend to neglect. 
Twentieth-century hurry has in it little of that win- 
some urbanity which breathes in every page of the 
Breakfast Table series. Years ago a writer in the 
English " Quarterly Review " uttered this timely 
word : " Opinions so directly contrary in many 
respects to the main direction of American move- 
ment brought Holmes at one time into disrepute with 
the more advanced of his countrymen. He was 
accused of attaching excessive importance to con- 
ventionalities of dress, manners, and speech ; he was 
charged with using his influence to starve and paralyze 
literary originality. To us it seems that his attitude 
was abundantly justified. The debt which the best 
American literature and all who in the Old World 
and the New appreciate its mixture of freshness and 
refinement owe to Holmes is very great. How great 
the debt was has not yet been fully recognized by 
his countrymen. When young America demanded 
that the political revolution which separated the Old 
and New Worlds should have its literary counterpart 
in a similar revolt, Holmes threw all his influence 
into the opposite scale. He urged, with keen satire 
as well as with the force of example, that even a 
Republic must recognize the laws of conventional 
decorum, and that those who enter the Temple of 
the Muses outrage propriety if they ostentatiously 
flaunt their working-dress." Dr. Holmes was the 
true Brahmin, in his books, in Beacon Street, every- 
where and on all occasions. And yet that bright 
playfulness of humor which so distinguished him 
renders peculiarly applicable to him Cicero's words 
descriptive of another : " Festivitate et facetiis . . . 
et superioribus et cequalibus sids omnibus prcestitit." 

Guessing at authorship is an old and favorite 
game, which has lately been put in a new form before 
the readers of "The Century." Probably most of 
those who read in the June number the first of the 
group of three stories dealing with the superstition 
of " Thirteen at Table " felt rather proud of their 
literary discernment in at once recognizing Dr. Weir 
Mitchell as the author. It will be remembered that 
the stories were published anonymously, but with the 
statement that each tale was by one of the following 
writers : Dr. Weir Mitchell, Mrs. Margaret Deland,

Mr. Owen Wister. The first story, u With the Coin 
of her Life," ranks highest of the group — a convinc- 
ing, simple, yet scientific presentation of the mental 
effect of an idee fixe upon a young girl whose every 
faculty is concentrated on the determination to be- 
come a great actress. No one who read the story 
could fail to see the impress of Dr. Mitchell in theme 
and treatment — the psychology and pathology of the 
'• case," the quiet observation, the little touches of 
reflective philosophy : all plausible proofs — only 
it now appears upon excellent authority that Dr. 
Mitchell did not write the story. It is Mr. Wister 
who has played a joke on the astute public by a 
brilliant and most successful masquerade — slipped 
into the Hippocratic cloak of the older novelist, and 
proved it so good a fit that probably few could hon- 
estly say that they had guessed his identity. Of 
course, according to the rules laid down by Poe in 
his "Purloined Letter," the reader should have known 
the story was not Dr. Mitchell's, because he was so 
obviously and glaringly indicated as its author ; but 
the wisdom of Dupin is not common. Shrewd divina- 
tions of the identity of the two remaining " thirteen " 
story-writers are now in order. 

An INTERESTING ACHIEVEMENT IN BOOK- 
COLLECTING would be the getting together of all the 
curiously misprinted Bibles that have appeared in 
our language during the four centuries and a half 
that this most popular of books has been issuing 
from the press at the rate of tens of thousands of 
copies yearly. We have, for example, the " wicked " 
Bible, printed in 1631, which omits the negative 
from the seventh commandment, and which involved 
the printer in a little unpleasantness with the con- 
stituted authorities, ending in his reluctant payment 
of a three hundred pound fine. The "place-makers " 
Bible, of 1562, is so called from a substitution of I 
for e in one of the Beatitudes. The " vinegar " 
Bible has a little misprint in the heading of the chap- 
ter relating the parable of the vineyard. A slight 
typographical error in the sixteenth verse of Jude 
has given us a " murderers " Bible, and another 
trivial slip in the twenty-sixth verse of the fourteenth 
chapter of Luke added the " wife-hater " Bible in 
1810 to the already long list of similar freaks. The 
"bug" Bible, the "to-remain" Bible, the "breeches" 
Bible, and only the biblical specialist knows how 
many more curious Bibles, are famous in biblio- 
graphic annals. To get them all together — on a 
twenty-foot shelf, if that would hold them — would 
be an achievement indeed. 

The order of thought and the order of 
speech must be held to be about the same in the 
speaker's mind, however different the arrangement 
of noun, adjective, verb, and adverb, in different 
languages. In the course of his recent Sorbonne 
address on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniver- 
sary of the Alliance Francaise, M. Paul Deschanel 



said : " Our language is the simplest, in that it 
employs the fewest words, and . . . one speaks the 
words in the order in which one thinks them." Does 
he, then, seriously believe that Germans and Hun- 
garians and Patagonians and Chinese transpose and 
rearrange their thoughts before putting them into 
words ? Merely because he himself says, for ex- 
ample, " The daughter of the innkeeper has stabbed 
the son eldest of the alderman apoplectic with a fork 
at two tines," while a German would announce the 
same tragic occurrence as, "The innkeeper's daughter 
has the apoplectic alderman's eldest son with a two- 
tined fork stabbed," does he think himself justified 
in declaring his to be the only natural and logical 
arrangement of the words used ? In economy of 
terms, both the German and the Englishman would 
easily surpass him in this instance. The thought 
and its verbal expression, the psychology of the 
speaker and the peculiarity of his idiom, are closely 
correspondent. Hence the vast number and variety 
of languages and dialects, and hence the blessed 
impossibility of a universal language — even with 
all the aid that simple spelling has been deemed 
capable of giving toward advancing the claims of 
our own tongue as a Weltsprache. 

A noted scientist's library is seeking a 
purchaser. The late Professor Simon Newcomb's 
books — a collection rich in works on astronomy, 
mathematics, and physics, and also containing many 
publications on economic subjects — are to be sold 
either collectively or in parts. Before the owner's 
death a type-written catalogue was prepared under 
his direction, and to any intending purchaser a copy 
of this will be sent upon application to the executor 
of the estate, at No. 1620 P Street, Washington, D. C. 
One of the saddest events too often following a fa- 
mous scholar's death is the dispersion of that silent 
company of faithful friends and efficient aids in his 
studies, his carefully chosen books. One cannot but 
hope that Professor Newcomb's library may find its 
way, unbroken, either into the hands of some appre- 
ciative private owner or into the careful keeping and 
wise handling of one of our larger public or univer- 
sity libraries. The collection contains about 5000 
books and 4000 pamphlets, and includes what is prob- 
ably the most nearly complete astronomical library 
in this country, excepting only that of Harvard 
University. < . 

The proposal for an Edward Everett Hale 
memorial has not yet taken definite form, but the 
offering for sale of Dr. Hale's long-time residence 
in Roxbury points the way to what might prove a 
very suitable and inspiring form for the memorial 
to take. If only his study could be kept in nearly 
the same condition as when he and his secretary 
made it one of the busiest of literary workshops, it 
would be a spot well worth visiting. The library, 
it seems, has been bequeathed to Dr. Hale's children,

to be equally divided among them ; but inducements 
not wholly of a pecuniary character might be offered 
to ensure its preservation, nearly intact, in the room 
or rooms that it has so long occupied. The Aldrich 
house at Portsmouth, the Whistler house at Lowell, 
and, to go further afield, the Johnson house at Lich- 
field and the Shakespeare house at Stratford, have 
been made to serve as memorials of the most inter- 
esting and inspiring kind. So great-souled a man 
as Dr. Hale might well have, and doubtless will have, 
his name and memory attached to more than one 
form of literary or charitable or educational enter- 
prise ; but the preservation of his house as a place 
of unusual human interest is peculiarly appropriate. 

The public library and the playground con- 
stitute at this season rival attractions to the young. 
In the Second Annual Report of the James V. Brown 
Library, of Williamsport, Pa., is a paragraph explain- 
ing the falling-off in the use of the juvenile depart- 
ment. "It should occasion neither surprise nor 
regret," remarks the librarian. " In a locality which 
is as ideal for out-door life as this is, such an amount 
of reading as was indulged in by the boys and girls 
last summer cannot be regarded as truly desirable." 
An insufficient appropriation for book-purchases is 
given as the undoubted cause of the decline in circu- 
lation. The tax-payer kept his dollar or two that 
might have gone for new books, and his children 
enjoyed an extra allowance of fresh air and exer- 
cise ; therefore all was well. But in future it is 
hoped to make the juvenile department of the library 
a more formidable rival to the playground, without 
necessarily impairing the young reader's health and 
vigor. . . . 

" The only really native German poet " is 
the term — rather exaggerated, it would seem — 
applied by "Young Germany " to Baron Detlev von 
Liliencron, who died last month at the age of sixty- 
five. He was a writer of novels and plays, as well 
as poems, but is likely to be best remembered for his 
poems, or for the best of them scattered through four 
published volumes. In the dark hours of the Franco- 
German conflict, and in moments of personal sorrow 
or of serious thought, he showed himself capable of 
poetic utterance of the most moving sort. Also some 
of his prose works, as especially his Kriegsnovellen, 
are highly rated. It is noteworthy that the German 
Emperor, who has shown indifference or hostility 
to many contemporary German authors, was so de- 
lighted with Liliencron's war-stories, on first reading 
them a few years ago, that he ordered a pension to 
be paid to the poet-novelist as long as he lived. 

Judicious library advertising appears to be 
regarded as not undignified or in any way repre- 
hensible. The latest report of the Haverhill (Mass.) 
Public Library describes some methods it has adopted 
to attract otherwise indifferent persons to its plea- 
sant rooms. Mimeographed lists of recent accessions 



in Italian literature were sent to Italian clubs and 
to Italian residents enrolled in the city directory. A 
similar course was pursued with the French inhabit- 
ants. Who that has ever seen a non-English-speaking 
citizen helplessly fingering the card catalogue of his 
city's free library, in the vague hope of chancing upon 
a title in his own language, can doubt that these lists 
answered a real need ? A " Useful Arts Bulletin," 
also mimeographed, was from time to time mailed to 
workmen likely to be interested tn such practical 
works as it treated of ; and these lists were, in addi- 
tion, printed in the local newspapers, besides being 
freely distributed at the library and its branches. 
Many persons were thus prompted to use the library 
who had before been entirely unaware that it could 
furnish them exactly the reading matter in which 
they were interested. And this has been the experi- 
ence of other places besides Haverhill. 



C OMMUNICA TION. 



SHAKESPEARE'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I cannot resist replying to the communication of Mr. 
Johnson Brigham, in your issue of July 16, in which, 
speaking of the question of " The law in Shakespeare " — 
that point on which so many Baconians rest their case — 
he illustrates, by the example of Browning, the theory 
that a master artist " may gain sufficient technical lore, 
even in a difficult field, to astonish his critics." The 
method used by the poet in filling " The Ring and the 
Book " with law, for instance, was to get the law from 
the Book — that is, from his source. 

In many cases, Shakespeare has done this. In some 
cases, as in " The Merchant of Venice," the law was 
part of the story, if not of the vocabulary of the story. 
But in the majority of cases the law terms spring to the 
poet's lips as the most natural words in which to express 
his ideas. Richard Grant White, a lawyer as well as a 
Shakespeare scholar, said : " No dramatist of the time, 
not even Beaumont, who was the younger son of a judge 
of the Common Pleas, and who, after studying in the 
Inns of Court abandoned law for the drama, used legal 
phrases with Shakespeare's readiness and exactness. 
And the significance of this fact is heightened by 
another, that it is only to the language of the law that 
he exhibits this inclination. The phrases peculiar to 
other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of 
description, comparison, of illustration, generally when 
something in the scene suggests them ; but legal phrases 
flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary, and parcel 
of his thought." 

I will not ask your space to quote illustrations. They 
are everywere available. The point I wish to make is, 
that in Shakespeare the law is not " got up " for the 
nonce, as a modern novelist " gets up " his local color. 
It was in the dramatist's mind, as the phraseology of 
the Bible is in the mind of the Bible student, and as the 
terms of science are in the mind and on the lips of the 
botanist, the chemist, and the physicist.

Out of the Journalistic Wilderness.* 

For wealth of opportunity to meet men worth 
knowing and to see events worth witnessing, 
few walks in life can compare with that of the 
enterprising and successful journalist. Sir 
Henry W. Lucy (he has been knighted since the 
appearance of his book) presents, in a volume 
entitled " Sixty Years in the Wilderness," some 
extremely readable chapters of personal and 
professional reminiscence covering nearly half 
a century of newspaper work, preceded by a 
period of dull toil in an uncongenial commercial 
pursuit. Emancipation from seven years' drud- 
gery in the " Hide and Valonia Business," as his 
second chapter is entitled, with opportunity to 
join the staff of the Shrewsbury " Chronicle," 
must have been a joyful release indeed to the 
young man who began authorship in his twelfth 
year with an essay (still unpublished) on the less 
praiseworthy side of King David's character, 
followed two years later by a novel (also unpub- 
lished), with no plot in particular, and succeeded 
very soon thereafter by some metrical composi- 
tions that achieved publicity in the Liverpool 
4 * Mercury." 

Something of the daring and self-confidence 
of genius early displayed itself in the young 
journalist's manner of breaking a road for him- 
self through the wilderness of newspaperdom. 
Editor and joint proprietor of a weekly paper 
at the age of twenty, he experienced a rapid 
series of ups and downs — chiefly ups — until 
an assured position as manager of the parlia- 
mentary corps of the London " News," of which 
he was afterward for eighteen months editor-in- 
chief, and later a place on the staff of " Punch," 
in addition to his other appointments and engage- 
ments, enabled him very effectually to keep the 
wolf beyond howling distance of his door. Two 
years' editorship of the commercially unsuccesf ul 
u Mayfair," and the authorship of numerous 
magazine articles, two novels, and a number of 
politically reminiscent books, are also to be 
placed to his credit. A tremendous worker, but 
one whose execution is rapid and facile, and who 
(an important item) does all his writing through 
the medium of a stenographer, he has neverthe- 
less found time for a good deal of play, includ- 
ing three visits to the L nited States and a trip 
round the world. To the general public, or that

part of it that reads - Punch," Sir Henry has 
been known for nearly twenty-nine years as 
" Toby, M.P.," author of the weekly " Essence 
of Parliament " which Shirley Brooks began and 
Tom Taylor continued in the days preceding Sir 
Francis Burnand's editorship. 

Astonishingly small was the amount of 
schooling enjoyed (or hated) by the boy Lucy. 
Before reaching his eleventh birthday (suppos- 
ing him to have been born in 1845, of which 
he is not sure) he was cast adrift to sink or 
swim, according to his capacity. A single para- 
graph may here be quoted to help explain how 
it was that this early suspension of pedagogic 
drill was not the direst misfortune in his case. 

■ One day, whilst still at school, I was sent down to 
a circulating library in Lord Street [Liverpool], to 
change a book. The volume was < Percival Keene.' 
As I walked along I looked through the pages. Fasci- 
nated, I began at the beginning and read steadily on, 
walking through the crowded streets. The library was, 
I think, called the Athenaum, a sombrely respectable 
place, led up to by stone steps. On one of these I sat 
down and went on with the story. When I looked up 
the aspect of the street was changed. Lamps were 
beginning to twinkle here and there. People were hur- 
rying homeward in a steady stream. It was evening, 
and the hbrary was closed! I had been sitting on the 
steps all through the day, dinnerless. But I had fin- 
ished ' Percival Keene.' " 

Among the varied experiences that contrib- 
uted to the completion of Sir Henry Lucy's 
necessarily irregular education, he names a 
balloon ascent in company with Fred Burnaby ; 
a descent into a coal mine in South Wales, and 
one into a silver mine in Colorado ; a voyage in 
a submarine boat ; and the witnessing of two 
hangings. A short private secretaryship to a 
railway magnate, and an eight-months' sojourn 
in Paris to learn the language and habits of the 
natives, also entered into his peculiar training 
for journalism. But everything is, or ought to 
be, fish that finds its way into the journalist's 
net : and the young man appears to have 
developed a most acute scent for news and a 
happy knack of seeing the popularly interest- 
ing side of all that occurred within his range. 
From his rapid pen-pictures of noted men, with 
which the book abounds, a passage on Mark 
Twain and the attentions shown the great hu- 
morist during his late visit to England is worth 
quoting. 

" Amidst a constant succession of honours paid him 
during his stay in London, he counted at highest value 
the bestowal upon him of an honorary degree by the 
Oxford University and the invitation to dine at the 
Punch table. This last was unique in its way, since 
the Punch dining-room is ' tiled ' more jealously than a 
Freemasons' meeting room. Old traditions were pre-

served to the extent that the dinner was not one of the 
regular weekly symposia. But it was given in the dining- 
room, at the table on which are carved the names of the 
staff, going back to the days of Mark Lemon." 

The author's long familiarity with Parliament 
and parliamentarians enables him to give some 
very interesting descriptions and comparative 
estimates of the oratorical performances of Dis- 
raeli, Gladstone, Robert Lowe, John Bright, and 
other giants of debate, whose memorable speeches 
find few parallels in the more hurried and infor- 
mal utterances of present-day legislators at West- 
minster. As to Gladstone's peculiarities, we read: 

" His manner in speech-making was more strongly 
marked by action than was that of his only rival, John 
Bright. He emphasized points by smiting the open palm 
of his left hand with sledge-hammer fist. Sometimes 
he, with gleaming eyes — ' like a vulture's,' Mr. Lecky 
genially describes them, — pointed his forefinger straight 
at his adversary. In hottest moments he beat the brass- 
bound Box with clamorous hand that occasionally 
drowned the point he strove to make. Sometimes with 
both hands raised above his head ; often with left elbow 
leaning on the Box, right hand with closed fist shaken 
at the head of an unoffending country gentleman on the 
back bench opposite; anon, standing half a step back 
from the Table, left hand hanging at his side, right 
uplifted, so that he might with thumb-nail lightly touch 
the shining crown of his head, he trampled his way 
through the argument he assailed as an elephant in an 
hour of aggravation rages through a jungle." 

Contrasted with this we have the parliamen- 
tary appearance of Gladstone's great opponent. 

" Disraeli lacked two qualities, fading which true 
eloquence is impossible. He was never quite in earnest, 
and he was not troubled by dominating conviction. Only 
on the rarest occasions did he affect to be roused to 
righteous indignation, and then he was rather amusing 
than impressive. He was endowed with a lively fancy 
and cultivated the art of coining phrases, generally per- 
sonal in their bearing. When these were flashed forth 
he delighted the House. For the rest, at the period I 
knew him, when he had grown respectable and was 
weighted with responsibility, he was often dull. There 
were, indeed, in the course of a session few things more 
dreary than a long speech from Dizzy. At short, sharp 
replies to questions designed to be embarrassing he was 
effective. When it came to a long speech, the lack of 
stamina was disclosed, and the House listened to some- 
thing which, if not occasionally incomprehensible, was 
frequently involved." 

A significant note on Du Maurier, one of the 
author's old associates on the " Punch " staff, 
arrests attention. 

" With failing health, he was apt to be influenced by 
low spirits. Success from a new avenue, sunlit by quite 
unusual glow of pecuniary reward, came to him too 
late. He never was the same man after he made his 
great success with < Trilby.' I remember one night in 
the early summer, of the year of his death, dining with 
us at Ashley Gardens, he met an old friend. Talking 
about his next novel, Lord Wolseley asked what was 
the title. « I think,' said Du Maurier, with a humorous 
smile, < I '11 call it " Soured by Success." ' " 



Written in a brisk and effective style, though 
with many of the lapses and inelegances of the 
current journalistic manner, " Sixty Years in the 
Wilderness " is likely to meet with such favor 
as to encourage the issue of a second volume, 
already half -promised in the preface to the first. 
Among the inaccuracies, typographical or other, 
of the book, one finds Mr. Howells writing to 
the author a letter from " Killery Point, " which 
is almost an affront to historic old Kittery. 
The frontispiece portrait of Sir Henry (a photo- 
gravure from Mr. Sargent's painting) represents 
the sitter as holding a quill pen in his left hand, 
nearly in the position for writing. Is the pic- 
ture transposed, or is Sir Henry left-handed? 
Perhaps neither. Percy F. Bicknell. 



Taking Stock of Darwinism.* 



It is a very difficult thing for the average 
man, who is not a special student of either sci- 
ence or philosophy, to realize that the Evolution 
theory is itself constantly in process of evolution. 
The publication of the " Origin of Species " fifty 
years ago led to a literally tremendous disturb- 
ance in the thought of the world on nearly all 
subjects. Only after a prolonged and bitter 
struggle did the Evolution idea begin to gain 
general acceptance. In spite of this long Sturm 
und Drang period, the acceptance of Evolution, 
when it finally came, was in the popular mind 
very largely uncritical. In particular there 
was, and still is, much confusion of thought as 
to the distinction between " Evolution " and 
"Darwinism." The idea that Evolution is 
Darwinism prevails very widely. On this ac- 
count there is at the present a good deal of dis- 
turbance in the popular mind over the searching 
criticisms of Darwinism which have been made in 
recent years by such men as DeVries, Johannsen, 
and others. On the one hand, one hears anxious 
inquiries, from those who "believed" in Evolu- 
tion on the supposition that scientific research 
had made it as solid and unchangeable as the 
rock-ribbed hills, as to whether " scientists " are 
giving up Evolution because it is an exploded 
doctrine. On the other hand come those eager to 
reopen the old battle with an accession of enthu- 
siasm and courage engendered by the supposed

discovery of a weakening and wavering of the 
enemy. These triumphantly proclaim, and cite 
published statements in their support, that the 
scientific world is surreptitiously but not the less 
actually '-casting aside the Evolution theory." 

It u the writer's belief that the two books 
here under review will do much to correct such 
confusion of thought, by showing in an author- 
itative and at the same time untechnical and 
interesting manner what the present state of 
expert scientific opinion regarding Evolution 
and Darwinism is. Both books are symposia, 
each containing contributions from a number of 
different investigators : and both were prepared 
in connection with great gatherings of scientific 
men to commemorate the one hundredth anni- 
versary of the birth of Charles Darwin. In gen- 
eral, both books have the same purpose. In 
method of treatment, the most noticeable dif- 
ference is that which arises out of the fact that 
in one case ("Darwin and Modern Science") 
we are dealing with a collection of essays, while 
in the other case (" Fifty Years of Darwinism") 
we have a collection of addresses primarily in- 
tended for viva voce presentation. The latter 
mode of presentation obviously necessitates a 
somewhat different treatment than can be used 
in an essay. 

" Darwin and Modern Science " is catholic in 
its subject-matter and cosmopolitan in its author- 
ship. The volume opens with an " Introductory 
Letter to the Editor, from Sir Joseph Dalton 
Hooker.'' This, and the following essay on 
" Darwin's Predecessors," by Professor J. 
Arthur Thomson, are chiefly of historical in- 
terest. There follows a group of four essays 
dealing with the several primary factors of 
organic evolution as conceived by Darwin. 
These are : M The Selection Theory," by the 
illustrious exponent and developer of that theory, 
Professor August Weismann ; " Variation," by 
the Dutch botanist Professor Hugo de Vries, 
whose studies of this subject mark the beginning 
of a new epoch in the investigation of the prob- 
lem of organic Evolution, just as did Darwin's 
fifty years ago ; Heredity and Variation in 
Modern Lights." an unusually temperate and 
well-balanced essay by the leading student of 
heredity at the present time, Professor Bateson 
of Cambridge University : •• The Minute Struc- 
ture of Cells in Relation to Heredity," by one 
who shares with Hertwig, Fol and Van Beneden 
the honor of having u solved the long-standing 
riddle of the fertilization of the egrsr. and the 
mechanism of u hereditary transmission," Pro- 
fessor Eduard Strasburgfer of Bonn. 



The next three essays group about the relation 
of Darwin's work to anthropology. Schwalbe, 
one of the most eminent of living anthropologists, 
contributes a critical essay on " The Descent of 
Man." Professor Haeckel writes on " Charles 
Darwin as an Anthropologist," and J. G. Frazer, 
of Trinity College, Cambridge, discusses " Some 
Primitive Theories of the Origin of Man." The 
next three essays deal with the ontogenetic and 
phylogenetic records of the evolutionary process. 
The titles are : " The Influence of Darwin on 
the Study of Animal Embryology," by Professor 
Adam Sedgwick of Cambridge ; and " The 
Palaeontological Record," the first section on 
Animals, by Prof. "W. B. Scott of Princeton, the 
second section on Plants, by Dr. D. H. Scott. 

In the succeeding group of three essays there 
is discussed, from widely different view-points, 
one of the most fundamental of Evolution prob- 
lems, namely, the influence of environment upon 
organisms. These essays are : " The Influence 
of Environment on the Forms of Plants," by 
Professor Georg Klebs of Heidelberg, known 
for his brilliant and thorough researches on this 
subject ; " Experimental Study of the Influence 
of Environment on Animals," by Professor 
Jacques Loeb, the only American worker besides 
Professor Scott to appear as a contributor to 
the volume ; and " The Value of Color in the 
Struggle for Life," by Professor E. B. Poulton 
of Oxford, who stands without a peer in the study 
of animal coloration. 

Following these come three essays by Sir 
William Thiselton-Dyer, Dr. Hans Gadow, and 
Professor J. W. Judd, respectively dealing with 
the problems of the geographical distribution of 
plants and animals and with Darwin's service to 
the science of geology. Two essays, one by his 
son Francis Darwin, and the other by Professor 
K. Goebel of Munich, deal with Darwin's 
botanical work. 

The next seven essays have to do with the 
relation of Darwinism to the so-called " human- 
istic " fields of thought. In many respects these 
form the most interesting part of the book. They 
show more clearly than any of the other essays 
how tremendous has been the influence of Darwin 
in fields far removed from those in which he him- 
self worked. Thus, an essay by Dr. Jane Ellen 
Harrison, on M The Influence of Darwinism on 
the Study of Religions," begins with these words : 

" The title of my paper might well have been ' The 
creation by Darwinism of the scientific study of Religions,' 
but that I feared to mar my tribute to a great name by 
any shadow of exaggeration. Before the publication of 
' The Origin of Species ' and ' The Descent of Man,' 
even in the eighteenth century, isolated thinkers, notably

[August 16, 



Hume and Herder, had conjectured that the orthodox 
beliefs of their own day were developments from the 
cruder superstitions of the past. These were, however, 
only particular speculations of individual skeptics. 
Religion was not yet generally regarded as a proper 
subject for scientific study, with facts to be collected 
and theories to be deduced. A Congress of Religions 
such as that recently held at Oxford would have savored 
of impiety." 

Other essays in this group deal with Sociology 
(Bougie), Modern Philosophy (Hoffding), Phil- 
ology (Giles), History (Bury), and Psychology 
(Lloyd Morgan), in the relation of these subjects 
to Darwinism. The last two papers in the vol- 
ume, by Sir George Darwin and W. C. D. 
Whetham respectively, have to do with Evolu- 
tion in the inorganic realm ; the subjects are 
" The Genesis of Double Stars " and " The 
Evolution of Matter." 

It is obviously impossible within limited space 
to discuss separately each of the essays that make 
up this volume. The eminence of the contrib- 
utors furthermore makes any commendation of 
individual essays by a reviewer appear like pre- 
sumption. It can, however, properly be said 
that the volume as a whole forms a fitting and 
worthy tribute to Darwin s memory. It is a 
book that should be on the shelves of every 
library, whether public or private, which aims 
to reflect in its choice of books the progress of 
contemporary thought. 

The aim of " Fifty Years of Darwinism," 
while in general the same as that of the book 
just under discussion, is less ambitious. The 
addresses in this volume all deal directly with 
biological topics in the narrower technical sense 
of the term. These addresses were delivered at 
a special Darwin Memorial meeting of the 
American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, at Baltimore, on New Year's Day of 
this year. The first principal address, which 
gives the title to the volume, is by Professor 
Poulton of Oxford, who was the guest of honor 
of the occasion. The address is historical, deal- 
ing with the changes of opinion and ideas 
regarding Evolution which have come about 
since the publication of " The Origin of Species." 
It gains great charm from the wealth of anecdote 
and personal reminiscence which the author is 
able to contribute from his long acquaintance 
with men and affairs in English scientific life. 

The other addresses (with two exceptions) 
deal with the several factors generally held by 
biologists at the present time to be of primary 
importance in organic Evolution, and present in 
summarized and popular form the results of the 
most recent investigations in those fields. A 



simple list of the titles and authors will suffi- 
ciently indicate the scope of these essays and 
vouch for their excellence. These titles are : 
" The Theory of Natural Selection from the 
Standpoint of Botany," by Professor Coulter 
of the University of Chicago ; " Isolation as 
a Factor in Organic Evolution," by President 
David Starr Jordan ; " The Cell in Relation to 
Heredity and Evolution," by Professor Wilson 
of Columbia ; " The Direct Influence of Envi- 
ronment," by Dr. MacDougal of the Carnegie 
Institution's Desert Botanical Laboratory ; 
" The Behavior of Unit Characters in Heredity," 
by Professor Castle of Harvard ; " Mutation," 
by Dr. Davenport of the Station for Experi- 
mental Evolution maintained by the Carnegie 
Institution ; "Adaptation," by Professor Eigen- 
mann of Indiana University. 

The last two addresses in the volume are some- 
what different in character. Dr. Henry Fairfield 
Osborn writes on "Darwin and Palaeontology," 
giving an interesting summary of his views as to 
the method of organic Evolution. The closing 
address is by President G. Stanley Hall, and 
has the title "Evolution and Psychology." 

Altogether, these make an interesting and val- 
uable set of papers, and form a notable demon- 
stration of the flourishing condition of American 
biological science. In every case, the speakers 
were men who have achieved international rep- 
utation for the contributions which they have 
made to the study of Evolution.

An Old-Time Statesman oe South 
Carolena .* 

The title to fame of some characters in history 
rests partly or wholly on some connection with 
another of far greater eminence. The slighting 
remark has often been made of Robert Y. Hayne, 
that his only title to fame is the fact that he 
drew from Webster one of his greatest oratorical 
efforts. The falsity of this assertion is now fully 
demonstrated by Mr. Jervey, in his new Life of 
Hayne, which is likely to prove one of the most 
important contributions of the year to American 
biography. He does this by setting forth the 
eminent public services of Hayne, both before 
and after his debate with Webster. 

Hayne's life may be said to have been devoted 
to two things : the doctrine of Nullification, and

the industrial development of South Carolina. 
It is not difficult to see the relation of the former 
to the latter. 

Hayne's rise was rapid, but not meteoric. He 
had gone the rounds of South Carolina politics 
before being pushed into the United States 
Senate, possibly a little prematurely, at the age 
of thirty-two, by John C. Calhoun, who had 
Presidential aspirations, and wanted William 
Smith, a supporter of Crawford, replaced by 
one friendly to himself. Though young in years 
and without Congressional experience, Hayne's 
position in the Senate was not inconspicuous. 
As a member of the Committee on Naval Affairs, 
he was the author of a bill to establish a naval 
academy. The question of internal improve- 
ments had been sidetracked by Monroe, and the 
Tariff was becoming the dominant issue. Con- 
spicuous among the opponents of Clay's bill of 
1824 were Webster in the House and Hayne in 
the Senate. Had both died at the close of this 
session, Hayne probably would now be regarded 
as the greater of the two. Just before the fight 
opened on the Tariff of 1828, Webster entered 
the Senate. By this time he was wavering ; 
consequently the Boston merchants, when they 
desired to be heard against the bill, presented 
their protest, not to Webster, but to Hayne, to 
be by him laid before the Senate. In the end, 
Webster supported the act of 1828. 

South Carolina pointed to economic evils as 
her reason for opposing the Tariff both in 1821 
and 1828. As this failed to produce the desired 
result, she then resorted to another argument, 
which had been used before with telling effect, 
unconstitutionality and nullification. An effort 
was made to bring this into play in 1830, but 
the Union party was able to stave it off until 
the act of 1832 was passed. 

Among the great leaders, the personal equa- 
tion was not eliminated. Jackson had come to 
the Presidency without committal on the Tariff, 
but naturally had " low-tariff " leanings. Jack- 
son and Clay were personal enemies : conse- 
quently, when Clay announced, in 1832, that 
to " maintain and strengthen the American 
system, he would defy the South, the President, 
and the Devil," there could be no wavering. 
Unfortunately for the cause of the opposition 
to the Tariff, but fortunately for the Union, 
Jackson and Calhoun also were at outs. 

However much we may differ with Hayne on 
Nullification, we must recognize the greatness of 
the man in his devotion to a principle for its 
own sake, without being influenced by personal 
animosities or partisan rancor. He had appealed 



to reason in the Senate, and had failed to stem 
the Tariff tide. He had devoted himself to the 
interests of South Carolina, and he now believed 
those interests so seriously threatened that an 
appeal must be made to the final resort, Nulli- 
fication, and possibly to forcible resistance. He 
could do nothing more in the Senate ; conse- 
quently he resigned, and became Governor of 
South Carolina, — not simply, as some represent, 
to make a place for Calhoun, but because the 
test of Nullification would be made in South 
Carolina and not in the Senate. 

Mr. Jervey thinks that the strong expressions 
of nationality in Jackson's proclamation are 
only the voice of Livingston, his secretary of 
state. He also presents some evidence that the 
President had written strong words of approval 
to Hayne for his State's-rights views as ex- 
pressed in the reply to Webster. Certain it 
is that he expressed no violent animosity for 
Hayne, while there is a not very well authen- 
ticated tradition that he threatened to hang 
Calhoun. Also, a few years later, Jackson 
invited Hayne to spend a day with him at the 
Hermitage. In view of this, one may be par- 
doned for wondering if Jackson would have 
allowed South Carolina to nullify, as he had 
done in the Georgia case, had it not been for 
his violent hatred of Calhoun. Probably not, — 
but who knows ? 

The question of Nullification settled, Hayne 
devoted himself with unremitting energy, for 
the rest of his life, to the industrial development 
of South Carolina. As population spread to 
the west, the problem of transportation was ac- 
centuated more and more. Hayne saw clearly 
that this must be solved, if the South was to 
hold her own, Tariff or no Tariff. As far back 
as 1821, he appears to have been the first to 
suggest the possibilities of a steam railroad con- 
necting Charleston with Augusta and Columbia. 
He now took up the greater problem of cross- 
ing the mountains and tying the West to 
Charleston. His scheme was to cross North 
Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and reach 
Cincinnati. Again and again he reiterates that 
one motive of such connection was to tie together 
with bands of interest the different sections of 
the country, and so perpetuate the Union. 

The scheme was worthy of a great industrial 
leader and a statesman. South Carolina sub- 
scribed liberally to the enterprise, as did also 
Tennessee : but difficulties were encountered 
in Kentucky, and Ohio did almost nothing. 
Calhoun once gave his approval to the plan, 
and even suggested that he might accept the 



96 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



presidency of the road. Hayne never made any 
such suggestion about himself, but was over- 
whelmingly elected. Calhoun soon found objec- 
tions to the French Broad route, resigned from 
the directorate, and worked for a route across 
Georgia to the Mississippi. One motive for this 
appears to have been a desire to sectionalize the 
country, tying the interests of the Southwest to 
the old slave states, and allowing the great 
Northwest to find its outlet through the East. 
So great was the opposition to his scheme that 
Hayne finally compromised on routes, only to 
see failure written over his project before his 
untimely death in 1839. 

Concerning the great debate with Webster, 
it is not necessary to add much here. The 
notion that Webster completely demolished 
Hayne, once widely current, is no longer so 
generally accepted. Historically, except upon 
the great absurdity of Nullification and the 
beneficent influence of slavery, Hayne was 
nearer right than Webster. But herein is to 
be found the greatness of the latter when con- 
trasted with the former. While Hayne was 
harking back to the past, and looking to a 
written instrument and its contemporary inter- 
pretation as marking for all time the bounds of 
development for the nation, Webster, perhaps 
somewhat unconsciously, had turned to the 
future, and in what on its face was only an 
apotheosis of the Constitution he really com- 
pressed into a few glowing sentences the national 
aspirations of a great people which we are still 
working out. Subsequent history has set its seal 
of approval on Webster rather than on Hayne. 

A word should be said of Mr. Jervey's book 
as a bit of historical biography. First of all, 
he should be commended for giving us an 
entirely sympathetic account of Hayne, while 
at the same time condemning one of the great 
issues for which he fought, Nullification. He 
also deserves praise for set'ing before us the 
broad-minded patriot who appeared after his 
favorite issue of Nullification had been side- 
tracked. Is the undercurrent of hostility to 
Calhoun, discoverable throughout the book, to 
be justified ? Perhaps so, because of his mani- 
festations of littleness toward the main hero. 

The author has made good use of source 
material, some of which, such as contemporary 
newspapers, is not readily accessible. But in 
the matter of construction, his work is not 
above criticism. Even his meaning is sometimes 
rendered obscure by involved sentences and anti- 
quated punctuation. Quotations are very num- 
erous. The author has hardly protected himself 



against criticism on this score by his defense of 
Hayne on the same charge. Perhaps a more 
serious criticism is that he has attempted to 
delineate a national hero in a setting almost 
entirely local. Even for the period when Hayne 
was in Congress, the amount of space devoted 
to national and local affairs is not well balanced. 
All things considered, however, Mr. Jervey 
deserves our thanks for this study of a man who 
played a conspicuous part in one of the critical 
periods of our history. David Y. Thomas.

part of the " silence in the ether." Life had become 
for him an obsessing horror. He could no longer 

bear the 

" Awful lot 
To live with palsied souls and numb 
Affections! Higher courage not 
With sound of prayer or sound of drum 
In battle or in martyrdom 
Was ever shown by saint or knight." 

And yet — strange perversity! — in this very city 
of dreadful night, in this very London with Fleet 
Street as its epitome, he could find matter for gen- 
uine poetry, and soar upon the wings of imagination 
into the purest heavens. " Fleet Street " is the name 
of his last volume, and the title of its most impres- 
sive poem — a poem which links the bricks of the 
city in cosmic unity with the rings of Saturn. The 
bricks are discontented, albeit an 

" Indispensable, an integral 
Component of the world's most famous street," 

and continue envious of the rings of Saturn, although 
it is made clear that 

" These seeming jewelled zones that shine so bright 
Are the mere wreck of matter, broken bits, 
Detached and grinding beaches of barren rock 
Hung up there as a menace and a sign ; 
Circular strips of chaos unredeemed, 
Whirling in madness of oppugnant powers." 

Urged to be proud of their "telluric destiny," the 
bricks reply as with one voice : 

" Upon my cubical 
Content, and by our common mother, I 
Had rather shine, a shard of chaos, set 
In Saturn's glistening rings, the exquisite 
Enigma of the night, than be the unnamed, 
Unthought-of copestone or foundation-stone 
Of any merely world-distinguished street."' 

The application of this parable to the poet's own 
case is only too evident. The Crystal Palace, the 
railway station, and the automobile, are among the 
themes which he touches with the gleam of imagina- 
tion, and he gives us a couple of new " Fleet Street 
Eclogues " in the old fantastic vein. But bitterness 
is the underlying note of his verse, and mordant 
irony its characteristic method of expression. Him- 
self out of tune with life, he hears only discords and 
is powerless to effect their resolution. 

" The Poems of A. C. Benson," in the form now 
published, are not new. The stout volume of more 
than three hundred pages is a selection from the 
contents of half a dozen previously published vol- 
umes. Mr. Benson is as fluent a writer of verse as 
of prose, and his poems are thoughtful, placid, and 
refined, but not distinguished. They may fairly be 
taken at his own valuation. 

" I cannot sing as sings the nightingale, 

Frenzied with rapture, big with rich delight. 
Till lovers lean together, passion-pale, 

And chide the awestruck silence of the night. 

" I cannot sing as sings the tranquil thrush, 
O'er dewy thicket and untrodden lawn, 
When early gossamers veil the frosted bush 
In the chaste freshness of the sparkling dawn. 



" I cannot sing as sings the brooding dove, 

At windless noon, in her high towers of green, 
A song of deep content, untroubled love, 
With many a meditative pause between. 

" I cannot sing as sings the dauntless owl 

His shout of horror at a dark dead hour : 
When the hair pricks, and startled watch-dogs howl, 
And night-bells clamour in the lonely tower. 

" But I can sing as sings the prudent bee, 

As hour by patient hour he goes and comes, 
Bearing the golden dust from tree to tree, 
Labours in hope, and as he labours, hums." 

We may say of this composition, as Mr. Saintsbury 
once said of Lamartine's "Le Lac," that it is so 
typically illustrative of the author's work as to make 
unnecessary the quotation of any further examples. 

"Apollo and the Seaman" is a long poetic dia- 
logue. The seaman, who has recently come ashore, 
is dispirited at the news that his ship has gone down. 

" I heard them calling in the streets 
That the ship I serve upon — 
The great ship Immortality — 
Was gone down, like the sun." 

The god, who in mortal guise is seated with the 
seaman at an inn, takes up the subject, and works 
around to the suggestion that the good ship Earth 
may in the end prove a more trustworthy craft. 

" O wrestler into consciousness, 
Stand upon Earth ! Away ! 
Long hath the journey been by night, 
But roseate breaks the day ; 
Like a scroll I unfold the mountain-tops 
And the windings of the bay." 

To the seaman's question, "Is there a hand upon 
the helm ? " the answer is thus vouchsafed : 

" Weigh thou thine own heart-fires, 
And her wash of overwhelming dawns 
And her tide that never tires — 
Her tranquil heave of seasons — flowers — 
All that in thee aspires. 

How like an eagle on the abyss 
With outspread wing serene 
She circles ! — thought rolls under her 
And the flash from the unseen. 

But if thy former priestly ship 

Failed of the port assigned, 

The overwhelming globe takes on 

Her altar-flame of mind, 

See that the oils that feed the lamp 

Fail not." 

And so, pursuing his high argument, the god opens 
the seaman's eyes to a deeper truth than he has 
ever visioned before, to the truth of the essential 
oneness of things, to the realization that a man's 
cherished individuality — which he so passionately 
hopes will be continued after his death — is but the 
product of a fleeting illusion. 

" Through the death-veil — looming silvery — 
Through the self- veil's subtle strand, 
Dawns it not ? For that dawn thy heart 
Hath eye — shall understand 
Before its seeing rock-walls melt 
And cracks the mortal band. 
For when once the whole consummate strength 
Of thy slow-kindling mind

Can see in the heart's light at length 

All the strange sons of mankind, 

Then the Earth — that else were but a strait 

Rock-sepulchre — is new : 

Of what account to it is death ? 

It ia glowing, through and through, 

It moveth, alive with a God's breath, 

Translucent as the dew ! " 

This symbolical poem is vigorous and even rugged 
in expression, and has a nobility of thought and feel- 
ing that makes it akin to the ripest work of George 
Meredith. But the poem forms only a small part 
of the contents of Mr. Herbert Trench's significant 
volume, and other pieces claim our attention. The 
" Stanzas to Tolstoy " repeat the teaching of " Apollo 
and the Seaman," and we must reproduce one of 
them. 
" The Man upraised on the Judaean crag 

Captains for us the war with death no more. 
His kingdom hangs as hangs the tattered flag 
Over the tomb of a great knight of yore ; 
Nor shall one law to unity restore 

Races or souls — no staff of thine can urge 
Nor knotted club compel them to converge, 
Nor any backward summit lead them up : 
The world spring wherein hides 
Formless the God that forms us, bursts its cup — 

Is seen a Fountain — breaking like a flower 
High into light — that at its height divides ; 

Changelessly scattering forth, — in blaze and shower — 
In drops of a trembling diaphaneity — 

Dreams the God-breathings momently up-buoy 
To melt a myriad ways. Those dreams are we 
Chanted from some unfathomable joy." 

And still again, in the lyric, " I Seek Thee in the 
Heart Alone," Mr. Trench expounds his transcen- 
dental philosophy. 

" Fountain of Fire whom all divide, 
We haste asunder like the spray, 
But waneless doth Thy flame abide 
Whom every torch can take away ! 

" I seek Thee in the heart alone, 
I shall not find in hill or plain ; 
Our rushing star must keep its moan, 
Our nightly soul its homeward pain.'' 

" Song out of thought, Light out of power, 
Even the consumings of this breast 
Advance the clearness of that hour 
When all shall poise, and be at rest. 

" It cracks at last — the glowing sheath, 
The illusion, Personality ; 
Absorbed and interwound with death 
The myriads are dissolved in Thee." 

The Meredithian glow and opidence, the Meredithian 
swiftness of intellectual motion, are evident in these 
examples, as throughout Mr. Trench's volume. How 
high is his ideal of the mission of song may be seen 
in the following " Stanzas on Poetry," in which the 
muse counsels the singer and exalts his lofty calling. 

" In thee Man's choir assembles, and finds tongue ! 
Thy soul like Roland's horn of echoes flung 
Must seize the mountains that it gropes among, 
Must strike and must betray the Invisible — 
Black peaks that like a crowd of humbled Gods 
Attend the benediction of the Dawn ! 

" Sing Valour, from the cradle to the pyre ! 

Sing thine own country's glories, grief and ire ; 
Hear thou the voice of every greening brier ; 



And in thy song let all her woods be temples, 

Her rude heights and calm headlands clothed in foam 

Nerve thee, and be within thee fortitudes ! 

" Sing Love, and all that counteth not the cost ; 
And many a beautiful and unborn ghost 
(Even as the ever-widening starry host 
Steals from the luminous blue gulfs of evening) 
Softly shall join your ring of auditors 
Outside the sitters round the Tavern-fire." 

Some reprinted pieces, and a greater quantity of 
hitherto unpublished verse, are given us in Mr. 
Maurice Hewlett's " Artemision : Idylls and Songs." 
The new matter consists chiefly of three long poems, 
" Idylls of the Huntress," picturing the goddess in 
her character as the implacable foe of earthly passion. 
We will extract a passage from each of the three, 
beginning with these lines from the tragedy of 
** Leto's Child," the nymph Callisto transformed into 

aW "See here 

The end of that hot charioteer 
Who gives the loose rein to that horse 
That needeth most the bridle's force ! 
Nor boots to tell how Areas grew 
Mighty hunter, or how he slew 
Unknowing his mother ; nor how She 
That loved her still raised her to be 
A starry wreath when Heaven lies clear : 
So in the sky men watch the Bear 
Mount with the shining host, and tell 
What was Callisto ere she fell. 

And thus sink they who serve Beauty 
Otherwise than on bending knee, 
Or dare to quench their fleshly dreams 
At holy wells, in holy streams 
To bathe their bodies. Beauty is rare 
And delicate withal, so fair, 
And thin a fabric, 'tis a breath 
Of God's, whose prisoning is death." 

In " The Niobids," octosyllabics give place to heroic 

couplets. 

" Still gazing stood that mother, stricken blind, 
Rigid in grief that stony is and numb, 
For that it biteth in and leaveth dumb 
The lips, and sealeth up the fount of tears : 
And still, men say, her lonely image rears 
A marble head among the empty hills, 
But now 't is scored about with countless rills 
Whereby the traveller, hearing all the waters, 
Knows Niobe weeps yet her sons and daughters. 
For having pity on that grief so dry, 
Our Lord Apollo gave her grace to cry : 
Kinder than She (whose kindness were to kill), 
The Mistress of the cold nights on the hill ; 
Whose footfall is the soughing of the trees, 
And her white splendour seen when moonbeams freeze 
The bleacht earth huddled lowly on the plain ; 
Who slays and passes, looking not again ; 
Who, all too lovely to be loved, still goes 
Guarding with steadfast eyes her breast of snows." 

A stanzaic form is chosen for " Latmos," which is a 
new version of the myth of Endymion. The goddess 
has spoken her last words to him, and put him to 
sleep. 

" With that her pure throat let a little moan 

That she was made so fair, that all alone 

Her way must be, until in mortal man 

That grace of God be given to look upon 

Beauty for what it is, not what it can

" So she with light upon her like a wreath 
Of stars sped on her way with undim'd breath. 
One little sigh she suffered, such as Gods 
May know, who watch our footsteps far beneath 
Their skyey thrones — envying our abodes. 
Envying our lives of love, perhaps our death." 

Mr. Hewlett is also a Meredithian, as we have long 
since known from his prose ; as a Writer of verse he 
rather emphasizes the Meredithian vice of obscurity 
then the penetrating Meredithian vision. 

We always welcome the little books of verse that 
come to us from Oxford. They are not tumultuous 
calls from the world of action, but gentle reminders 
that there still remains somewhere, for those who 
care to seek it out. a world of contemplation in which 
the fever of life is soothed. Such a reminder is 
offered by Mr. G. X. Xorthrop's " In Itinere," and 
particularly by the little set of verses entitled •' Stars." 

•• The azure hive above is bright 
With swarms of golden bees : 
They glitter in the summer night 
Above the plumed trees. 

" Dear alchemists of light they sing 
About their heavenly task : 
They circle on with tireless wing 
And no respite they ask. 

" They store their treasure in the skies 
For those to taste who will : 
Their songs are full of sweet surprise 
For those whose lips are still." 

We must reprint one of Mr. Xorthrop's many beau- 
tiful sonnets, and our choice shall be '• For Ever," 
because of its harmony of grave diction and ripened 
thought. 

•• They prate of that eternity that glows 
Beyond the shadowed barriers we spend 
Our powers to mount : they tax their hours to rend 
The veil, whose pattern dark with secret woes 
Embroils our days and vanquishes repose. 
They tell us that this dusty journey's end 
Will bring unending peace and rest to mend 
The bruised members from terrestrial blows. 

" Believe them not ! The hour at hand must reap 
In joy her own reward. To-day is part 
Of all eternity : the soundless deep 
Lies under, not beyond. The valiant heart 
Need seek no kingdom o'er the unmapped sea, 
Discovering here and now his sovereignty." 

This is the wisdom of Goethe ; in fact, it is practi- 
cally a paraphrase of a famous quatrain of " Faust," 

" Thor, wer dorthin die Augen blinzend richtet," etc. 

An Oxford poet naturally thinks of Shelley, to whom 
the writer now under consideration pays exquisite 
tribute in a series of octave stanzas, two of which 
we quote. 

" Eternal friend to all aspiring youth, 
Born in a storm-torn age to break Wrongs reign ! 
Impatient seeker of the hidden truth. 
We mourn not thee, but those who call thee slain. 
The wings of morning never droop nor tire. 
Nor light grows weary of her crystal task : 
The cloud that so obscures man's high desire 
Is his own making, and a needless mask. 



" Upon the altars of thy thought flamed bright 
The Vestal fires of Truth : thy God was kind. 
Not made with hands ; nor worshipped aright 
Except in deeds and longings unconfined 
By barriers man-fashioned, absolute ; 
Through all thy days the heart's clear rhapsody 
In gladness prayed and not one hour was mute : 
And on thy lips a constant melody." 

u Andrea," by Mr. Gascoigne Mackie, is an 
incident of adventure in the Basque Pyrenees, a 
story of simple peasant kindliness amplified in the 
Wordsworthian manner. Other longish poems in 
the little volume give us further philosophic moral- 
izings occasioned by rather trivial matters. The 
sonnet on " The Shelley Memorial " at Oxford will 
best serve us for illustration. 

•• Above him hangs a sapphire-coloured dome 

Superb with stars : but through the rifted floor 
Breaks like eternity — his metaphor — 
The light beyond. We envy not dead Rome 
His little dust : for here — by fire and foam 

Twice-purged from every stain of mortal wrong, 
Th' imperishable soul of passionate song 
Even thy spirit, O Shelley, finds a home ! 

" Here, through the ages, shall thy shrine be shown ; 
Here, vindicated, on thy pyre sublime 
Lifted above the ebb and flow of time, 
The world shall pay thee homage, and shall own 
More strong than privilege and power and pride, 
Genius — of all her martyrs justified."' 

Mr. Charles H. Pritchard, who is the author of 
" Owen Glyndwr and Other Poems," cultivates the 
ballad form of composition, and writes lays of the 
legendary past after the fashion of Macaulay. 

'* Afar, on London's fortress vast 
Where carrion birds were fed, 
Stern Edward, ruthless to the last. 

Spiked brave Llewelyn's head. 
And with derisive ivy bound 
The brows fond Cambria's gold had crowned. 

'' As fast through Wales the tidings spread 
Her bright-eyed maidens wept, 
Her bards, to grace the Hero-Dead, 

Their thrilling harp string's swept, 
And place to greet Llewelyn gave 
With Arthur and Cad walla brave." 

Thus in stirring jog-trot rhythm the poet sings of 

heroes dead and gone. Xow and then he writes in 

lighter vein, as when he thus discourses of primitive 

man: 

'• He captured the girls he would wed, 

And clubbed them to keep them afraid ; 
He worshipped the ghosts of his dead ; 

He revelled in blood-feud and raid ; 

The price of slow progress he paid 
In ages of errors and woes, — 

To struggle till evil shall fade 
Man in the beginning arose." 

Mr. Mackie is most serious in his sonnets, of which 
" John Bunyan " is a good example. 

'■ Immortal Dreamer ! vainly was thy sight 
By rage Satanic veiled in prison shade. 
For Grace divine came swiftly to thine aid 
And showed thee Christian, victor in that fight 
Whence foiled Apollyon winged his dragon flight ; 
And taught thee how to traverse, undismayed, 
The Valley of the Shadow, though waylaid

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



By all that could the sinful soul affright. 
Oft didst thou sojourn in Immanuel's land 
Where amid fountains, flowers, and foliage green 
The Hills Delectable, sun-crested, stand ; 
Whence by the Shepherds' glass is partly seen, 
High o'er the gloomy river's farther strand, 
The great Celestial City's glorious sheen." 

Mr. Frederick John Webb writes of " Poetry " in 
this exalted strain: 

" I hold within my hand 

The gift of vision and song. 
From the twilight, shadowy land, 

Where spirits immortal long 
For the touch of an earth-born hand, 
Come dreams and the spring of song. 

" I bring, deep in my heart, 

Passion and passion-won peace ; 

And visions that never depart, 
And songs that will only cease 

When the wayfaring, weary heart 
Shall rest in the infinite peace. 

" And in my soul are born 

Dreams of the splendour of God ; 
To the soul of a creed outworn, 

To the soul of the earth-bound clod 
I call, and the souls, new-born, 
Are merged in the new-born God." 

Mr. Webb also writes sonnets of exceptional beauty. 
We quote the sextet only of the sonnet on " Tristan 
and Isolde." 

" Wounded to death, in throbbing agony, 
I dream of beauty, where my lips may drink 
A draught of life, outlasting death's rude gust ; 
Beyond the stars, beyond eternity, 
I hold but love, and leave all else to sink 
To ancient chaos and unconscious dust." 

We must also quote the latter half of " The End of 
the Day," which is the envoy of the collection. 

" Though our dream-songs all are flown 
With the day on golden wing, 
Yet the seed in morning sown 
Aftermath of youth shall bring. 

" In the night's impassioned strength 

Prisoned nature bursts her bars ; 

Homeward we shall turn at length, 

Reaping wisdom from the stars." 

Seven lyrics and fifty sonnets make up Mr. Lloyd 
Mifflin's latest volume, called "Toward theUplands." 
The most important of the lyrics is an ode to "The 
Thrush," in the manner of Keats. The following 
section fairly carries the burden of the poem's under- 
lying thought, and may, without too much violence 
to the context, be given by itself. 

" Vain is the wish ! 'T is not for me 
To touch thy feet in minstrelsy. 
The world hath need of sterner word 
Than I, or thou, darling Bird, 
Could e'er articulate. 
For thou art circumscribed by fate 
In all thy melody ; 
The little circle of thy lay, elate, 
Turns ever round thy mate and thee ! 
Thou hast no prescience in thy song 
And so thou dost not feel 
The agonies that come from Wrong 
Dealt unto human weal. 



What canst thou know of deep vicarious pain 
In bosoms such as ours ? 
Of aspirations daily slain '? 
Of javelins in the quivering soul 
From onset of the worldly powers ? 
What canst thou know of death, and famine's dole ? 
Or of the rising, world-ensanguined flood, — ■ 
The crimson trend of temporal things, 
While tiger-hearted Kings 
Lap, with their thirsty swords, the Nations' blood ? " 

From Mr. Mifflin's sonnets it is difficult to make a 
selection, so many and deserving are the claimants 
for distinction. " Sunset over Camelot " may be 
given for the richness of its imaginative coloring. 

" Faint, bannered towers of strange magnificence 
Loom on the verge of evanescent steeps. 
Donjons, dismantled, crumble into moats 
Of liquid jasper. Dim-emblazoned gates 

Open on sumptuous aisles, where columned courts 
Lead up to golden domes. And clarions blow, 
Far off, to spectral hosts, where faintly seen, 
Dissolving Legions girt with spear and plume, 

File on in purple pomp. Raised Phoenix-wings 
Of cloud, burn into life. With scarlet scales, 
Pythons — whose tongues belch flame — in dragon-coils 

Fade in unfathomed antres of the air 

Whose darkest depths flash splendor ; over all, 
The encrimsoned Wyverns beat their vans of fire." 

So opulent in diction is this poem, that the absence 
of rhyme is hardly realized. 

The poems which Mr. Cale Young Rice calls 
" Nirvana Days " fall into " non-dramatic " and 
" more or less dramatic " groups. The latter group 
contains the more vigorous work, and we should be 
glad to quote such a poem as " In the Flesh," for 
example, did space allow. But we must rest content 
with "The Soul's Return," a quiet and sincere lyrical 
meditation. 

" Let me lie here — 
I care not for the distant hills to-day, 
And the blue sphere 
Of far infinity that draws away 
All to its deep, 
Would only sweep 
Soothing the farther from me with its sway. 

" Let me lie here — 
Gazing with vacant sadness on this weed. 

The cricket near 
Will utter all my heart can bear to heed. 

Another voice 

Would swell the noise 
And surge, that ever sound in human need. 

" Let me lie here : 
For now, so long my wasted soul has tossed 

On the wide mere 
Of mystery Hope's wing alone has crossed, 

I ask no more 

Than to restore 
To simple things the wonder they have lost." 

The most important group of Mr. R. E. Lee 
Gibson's sonnets is of Mexican inspiration, and 
" Oaxaca " is a typical example. 

" These hills, they say, are veined with precious ores ; 
Silver and gold their granite hearts contain, 
Whereof each year, the toil-worn miners drain, 
Out of the rocks, immeasurable stores.

Exhaustless Ophirs, to these alien shores 

They lured, of old, those dauntless sons of Spain, 

Whose mighty galleons plowed the Spanish Main. 

Fraught with the wealth which here the earth outpours. 

Hills of Oaxaca, froni your aureate mould. 

Pure hearts have sprung here, like your native gold ; 

Hearts that loved Freedom, and divined her day : 

Intrepid Diaz, valorous and true, 

Like Juarez, here the breath of life first drew ; 

Immortal names that shall not pass away." 

Two longer poems, their themes taken from Chris- 
tian legend, fill out the measure of Mr. Gibson's vol- 
ume of refined and unpretentious verse. 

From a professional librarian we expect bookish 
verse, and Mr. Harry Lyman Koopman gives it to 
us. with something besides. His long titular poem, 
"The Librarian of the Desert," has for its subject 
the great library of the Senussi brotherhood, in the 
oasis of Kufra, in the heart of the Libyan Desert. 
This library was removed in 1893, borne upon the 
backs of several hundred camels, from its more 
exposed northern location to its present home three 
hundred miles farther away from danger. The 
following passage describes the journey. 

" So, day after day 
For a score of days we press 
Ever our southward way 
Though a wilder wilderness, 
To the region set apart 
In the desert's deepest heart 
To shelter our sacred lore. 
There at last shall we halt, 
Where the oasis lies enisled 
In a hundred leagues of sand 
That surge on every hand. 
By the hot winds driven and piled 
Barren as ashes or salt. 
But, to the Faithful's eyes, 
A blessed bound it lies. 
No foeman shall pass o'er. 



And the Truth forevermore 

From the desert, as ever of yore, 

On earth shall be shed abroad ; 

And the gardens of earth that bloom, 

The gardens no less shall become 

Of the holy Faith, and man, 

In the desert brought face to face 

H ith the infinite blessing and ban, 

Shall live in every place 

As under the eye of God." 

The verse contained in Mrs. Wharton's " Artemis 
to Actaeon " has the qualities to be expected from 
that accomplished writer. In her poems, perhaps 
more than in her stories, we find great refinement of 
feeling, sublety of thought, and a diction that will 
bear close critical scrutiny. Intellectualized and 
spiritualized in a high degree, it provides the satis- 
faction that may always be got from intercourse 
with a rich and serious mind. These very charac- 
teristics place it outside the category of poetry in 
the pure spontaneous sense; it is too sicklied o'er 
with the pale cast of thought, its artifice is too evi- 
dent, its song (as far as it sings at all) does not well 
straight up from the heart. What we have said 



may be well enough illustrated by a passage from 
the titular poem, in which Artemis gives Actaeon an 
elaborate explanation of the dulness of life upon 
Olympus, and of the reasons which prompted her to 
accept his worship and to slay him for his temerity. 
He has, she urges, no reason to complain, — 

" For immortality is not to range 
Unlimited through vast Olympian days, 
Or sit in dull dominion over time ; 
But this — to drink fate's utmost at a draught, 
Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip, 
To scale the summit of some soaring moment. 
Nor know the dulness of the long descent. 
To snatch the crown of life and seal it tip 
Secure forever in the vaults of death." 

There is more of vitality in the poem which comes 
a little later in the collection, taking the form of 
a dramatic monologue spoken by Vesalius when 
nearing the end of his days in exile. But even 
these words offer but a pale reflection of life itself. 
Mrs. Wharton's verse reveals only the grayer 
aspects of human existence, and has its being in 
the shadows. 

" Age after age the fruit of knowledge falls 
To ashes on men's lips ; 
Love fails, faith sickens, like a dying tree 
Life sheds its dreams that no new spring recalls ; 
The longed-for ships 

Come empty home or founder on the deep, 
And eyes first lose their tears and then their sleep." 

Thus opens the poem called "Non Dolet." The 
title makes a brave pretense, but its irony is too 
evident. 

Mrs. Theodosia Garrison's poems offer a refresh- 
ing contrast to the drab coloring of the pieces just 
mentioned. " The Joy o' Life " is their collective 
title, and it finds expression in buoyant sentiments 
set to swinging rhythms. 

•■ Oh, the Joy o' Life she calls me from the valley, 
Oh, the Joy o' Life she hails me from the height, 
And her voice is like the thrill of the thrush when noon is 
still, 
And her laughter is the lilting of delight. 
I follow through the sunshine and the moonshine — 

(Oh, I have seen the waving of her hand!) 
In the paths that know the fleet, flying touches of her feet, 
At the music of her mocking of command.'' 

A favorite form with this writer is a sort of sym- 
bolical parable in ballad form, such as "Stains." 

" The three ghosts on the lonesome road 

Spake each to one another, 
' Whence came that stain about your mouth 

No lifted hand may cover '.' ' 
' From eating of forbidden fruit, 
Brother, my brother.' 

"' The three ghosts on the sunless road 

Spake each to one another, 
' Whence came that red burn on your foot 

No dust nor ash may cover ? ' 
' I stamped a neighbour's hearth-flame out, 
Brother, my brother.'

" The three ghosts on the windless road 

Spake each to one another, 
' Whence came that blood upon your hand 

No other hand may cover ? ' 
' From breaking of a woman's heart, 
Brother, my brother.' 

" Yet on the earth clean men we walked, 
Glutton and Thief and Lover ; 
White flesh and fair it hid our stains 

That no man might discover.' 
' Naked the soul goes up to God, 
Brother, my brother.' " 

This writer does not avert her gaze from sorrow 
and evil, but faces them with a brave front and a 
determination not to be cowed. 

" God gives the battle to the strong — 

His heroes armoured with their might, 

To those undaunted souls who fling 

Light laughter to sore suffering 

And dare to stand, resist, and smite." 

This exultant note is the dominant one from begin- 
ning to end of her volume. 

"Confession, and Other Verses," by Miss May 
Austin Low, again invites us to the mood of mel- 
ancholy. 

" Chill is the night : Cold stars 

Creep from the clouds, and stare 
Down on the fields afar — 

And branches brown and bare. 

" Chill is my soul : Cold winds 
Spring from the past, to press 
Their hands upon my heart, and wake 
Grief's unforgetfulness." 

Religious musing is an important element in Miss 
Low's verse, and supplies what is perhaps its pre- 
vailing note. 

Miss Sara Hamilton Birchall, on the other hand, 
chirps cheerily of the joyous and care-free life in 
her " Songs of Saint Bartholomew." The sursum 
corda appeal is heard even in those pieces which 
admit the existence of a shadowy side of the human 
pilgrimage, as in these stanzas on "The Failures." 

" We burn our youth out gaily, 
And, faith, we had our fun. 
We laughed and dreamed and trusted Luck, 
And now, at last, we 're done. 

" The river is our kinsman, 
Fettered and foul and blue, 
With his yearning lap at the arches 
Where the tug-boats elbow through. 

" One day, when the farce is ended, 
He '11 give us a friendly bed, 
When the New Year 's caught us napping 
With a gray, dishonoured head. 

" Not yet we '11 claim our lodging, 
Good cousin, your sheets are damp — 
The bitter east wind snatches 
At the flame of the flaring lamp. 

" Not yet. We '11 risk our fortune, 
If the game goes up again, 
We '11 kiss Marie at the corner, 
And try your rest-house then."

with regard to the status ot the " Lost 
Dauphin " controversy is offered in the volume 
entitled " The King Who Never Reigned " (John 
McBride ) . There are several paragraphs of preface 
by M. Jules Lemaitre, a reprinting of the old 
" Memoirs upon Louis XVII." by the Royalist 
Eckard, a hundred pages of extracts from the 
memoirs of the insane imposter Naundorff, an 
epilogue which supplements the memoirs to the 
extent of furnishing a biography of the enthusiast, 
an appendix explaining the circumstance on which 
the false Dauphins founded their claims and giving 
an account of the procedure of a dozen more promi- 
nent pretenders among the hundreds who appeared ; 
and, finally, the ingenious essay by M. Joseph 
Turquan entitled " New Light on the Fate of Louis 
XVII." M. Turquan, who has found no new evi- 
dence but has made a earful independent study of 
the documents that exist, proves — to his own satis- 
faction, at least — first, that the royal child was 
assassinated in the Temple on January 19, 1794, 
between eight and nine o'clock at night ; second, that 
he was buried in the moat at once and secretly ; third, 
that a child who suffered from an incurable disease 
was put in his place, and that this child's death was 
announced to the world as the death of the Dauphin ; 
and, fourth, that the Dauphin's sister, the Duchesse 
d'Angeuleme, learned the whole story shortly after 
her return to France, but, having been bound to 
secrecy by an oath, was careful never to reveal it. 
It would seem that M. Turquan's evidences are some- 
what scanty to cover so considerable an extent of 
territory. The book, however, has interest and value 
as an epitome of a famous historic controversy which 
has long raged in France and found expression in 
our own country nearly a half century ago in the 
phrase " Have we a Bourbon Among Us ? "

" Public Service," " Dogma and Science," William 
Penn, and Ellen Dana Conway (the author's wife), 
are better worth reading for their own sake. As a 
whole, the book impresses one with its writer's mental 
and spiritual freedom and dignity, and also with his 
mastery of a graceful and effective literary style. 
Among the forcible utterances of the article on 
" Public Service," let us quote the following: 
" Whenever a nation makes a conquest, it must live 
up to it or down to it; must surround every sub- 
jugated country with a Monroe doctrine, ever expand- 
ing till it involves hostility to the whole world and 
loss of that free-will which alone can really inherit 
the earth and enjoy it." As a reverent free-thinker, 
a sane and safe radical, and an ardent lover of and 
seeker for truth at any cost, Mr. Conway deserves 
the widest possible reading.

of a reverent writes is worthy of the attention of 
Liberahst. ^i se rious-minded people. He names 

the volume containing his last religious messages 
"No Refuge but in Truth" (Putnam). Although 
the beautifully printed book contains less than a 
hundred pages, yet, like the tiny branches of a 
loaded fruit-tree, they are richly stored with great 
thoughts and noble sentiments. The nine chapters 
contain discussions in miniature of such supremely 
important themes as "Man and his Destiny," "New 
Faith Linked with Old," " The Scope of Evolution," 
"The Limit of Evolution," "The Immortality of 
the Soul," "Is there a Revolution in Ethics ?" "The 
God of the Bible," and others. The book closes 
with a brief discussion of " The Religious Situation." 
While there is little that is really original in these 
beautifully-moulded testimonies, they present many 
spiritual truths in a very fresh and helpful manner, 
the frank expression of a fearless mind. There is 
here no traditional or scientific dogmatism. To the 
aged veteran in the service of many high causes, the 
conclusion of the whole matter lies in this simple 
statement : " There is no refuge for us but in truth." 
Professor Smith accepts the doctrine of Evolution, 
but contends that merely materialistic evolution fails 
to account for man's higher nature, which calls for 
other than physical explanation. A hint toward 
what Evolution fails to explain in man is found in 
the sentence, " Beavers are wonderfully cooperative, 
but they have shown no tendency to establish a 
church ! " The robust faith of the author is given 
in these words : " A plan of which we are ignorant, 
but of which the end will be good, is apparently our 
only explanation of the mystery." 

Man's help, and Under the rather to ° ambitious title 
his hindrances " The Balance of Nature " (Dutton) 
from animals. Mr George Abbey classifies and 
analyzes the common animals and birds with refer- 
ence to the harm or good they do to man. The 
classification into " Insectivorous and Harmless," 
" Partly Useful and Partly Injurious," and " Destruc- 
tive, "is applied in successive chapters to wild animals, 



wild birds, water birds, migratory birds, reptiles, and 
game. The author attempts neither to defend nor 
condemn, but with scientific impartiality tells the 
story of each creature's habits and conduct from the 
standpoint of man's welfare. If any fault is to be 
found with the author's sense of justice, it is that 
while the second part of his book gives directions for 
trapping or otherwise destroying those creatures that 
sometimes do harm, no corresponding space is given 
to directions for protecting and preserving those that 
do good. The third section of the volume is devoted 
to domesticated animals, and makes many ingenious 
and amusing suggestions. One case is reported in 
which cats were employed successfully to patrol a 
strawberry bed and frighten away the birds. This 
was accomplished by placing collars around the cat's 
necks, attaching chains to these collars, and allowing 
the chains, by means of rings at the farther end, to run 
on wires strung along the aisles of the strawberry 
beds. " Saucers replete with milk and other evidence 
of food being supplied, rendered the arrangement 
complete." An abundance of cats and a scarcity of 
strawberries would seem to be implied by this ingen- 
ious scheme. Less fanciful and even more practical 
suggestions are made which householders and gar- 
deners might well give heed to. The volume is of 
substantial size, well made, and illustrated with a 
hundred and fifty " diagrammatical drawings." A 
view of the trained cats doing police duty at the 
strawberry beds would have been an interesting 
addition. 

to,.-- „,.»„/ „,™ Mr. Charles F. Warwick, a Phila- 

1 hree great men , # ' 

of the French delphia lawyer, is the author of three 
Revolution. volumes on "the three most distin- 

guished and representative men in each of the three 
distinctive periods of the French Revolution " (Jacobs 
& Co.). The first volume is on Mirabeau, the second 
on Danton, the third on Robespierre. While the 
volumes add little to what is known of the men or 
the period, they are good popular expositions of 
their subjects, and will be found useful as well as 
readable. Especially interesting, in the volume on 
Robespierre, are the first two chapters, containing a 
character-sketch of that remarkable man — a mosaic 
of the opinions of others bound together by the 
author's own views. After a chapter describing the 
early life of the great revolutionist, we are given 
twenty-two chapters relating not so much to Robes- 
pierre as to the Revolution — its causes, conditions, 
and results ; its leaders, interesting incidents, etc. 
The concluding chapters trace the decline of Robes- 
pierre's influence to his fall. The author's aim is, 
in part, to show that Robespierre was incorruptible, 
sincere, less radical than was commonly believed, and 
less bloodthirsty, especially toward the last. " He 
was possessed of a single ruling idea, and had a 
fixedness of purpose, an indefatigable perseverance, 
that neither fate nor defeat could weaken or destroy. 
His reserve was impenetrable, and this made it 
interesting as well as difficult to fathom his purpose.

out generous emotions, he yet had qualities that 
enabled him to force his way to the front, and by a 
relentless policy to overthrow his adversaries, attain 
eminence, and in one of the stormiest periods of the 
world's history to exercise a power that was almost 
imperial. . . . He was a product of the eventful 
and exceptional times in which he lived." 

In a small volume attractively illus- 

SS. trated and clearl y P rinted > Mr - 

Charles Stedman Hanks tells the 
story of " Our Plymouth Forefathers, the Real 
Founders of the Republic" (Estes). Beginning 
with a chapter on "The English Separatists," 
which gives the commonly accepted account of 
King Henry VIII.'s rupture with Rome, the author 
traces the course of the Pilgrims from Scrooby to 
Holland and America, the greater part of the 
book being naturally devoted to the vicissitudes of 
the colony at Plymouth. Due honor is paid to 
Provincetown, as the place of our forefathers' first 
landing; and some account is also given of the 
Buzzards Bay, Connecticut River, and Penobscott 
River trading posts, with one chapter on "The 
Puritan Settlement at Boston." The author is in- 
clined to see the hand of fate leading these early 
settlers in their wanderings, and his final chapter 
he entitles " A People of Destiny." In the imme- 
diately preceding chapter some glimpses are fur- 
nished of the every-day life of our Plymouth 
ancestors. The book is well suited to the needs 
and tastes of young students of American history, 
and is good reading for older persons also. 



A French 
historian 
of gossip . 



M. Joseph Turquan, who has acquired 
a position in France as an historian 
of gossip, has achieved a volume on 
" The Love Affairs of Napoleon," a very good trans- 
lation of which, by Mr. J. Lewis May, is published 
by the John Lane Co. A volume on such a subject 
could scarcely be expected to be proper literary diet 
virginibus puerisque ; and although there is perhaps 
nothing unnecessarily offensive in M. Turquan's 
method of handling it, we have chronique scandaleitse 
from the first page to the last. The work is, of 
course, no more than a compilation. Fragments of 
more or less well-authenticated gossip are regularly 
sandwiched with cheap comment which strives to be 
at the same time cynical and respectable ; yet this 
narrative, in common with everything from M. Tur- 
quan, possesses the merit that covers a multitude of 
literary defects — the merit of being eminently read- 
able. A psychologist might even find it possible to 
show that this author possesses both the virtues and 
the faults that make for popularity ; although a 
moralist might deplore the application of these quali- 
ties — in this volume at least — in a direction so 
little edifying. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



One who takes his history not too heavily will find 
Mrs. Julia Henderson Levering's volume on " Historic 
Indiana " (Putnam) worth reading. It is written in an 
attractive style, and narrates the story of Indiana from 
its earliest beginnings under the French regime down to 
the present time, bringing out forcibly the dramatic 
elements in the history of this frontier State. While 
adding nothing especially new, such volumes have their 
legitimate use in popularizing the knowledge reached 
at the time of publication. As scholarly research ad- 
vances, similar books will be written, so that new view- 
points and more accurate interpretations may become 
known by a larger reading public. The volume is well 
and attractively illustrated. 

Three new Baedekers are ready for the present 
tourist season. " The United States," still edited by 
Mr. J. F. Muirhead, is now in its fourth edition, and 
includes excursions to Mexico, Cuba, Porto Rico, and 
Alaska. Americans seem to be learning that a Baedeker 
is no less useful for travel in their own country than in 
foreign parts. The volume now fills over eight hun- 
dred pages, and is equipped with some eighty maps 
and plans. The " Northern France," now in its fifth 
English edition, covers the region from the Channel to 
the Loire. The " Norway, Sweden, and Denmark," 
now in its ninth edition, includes excursions to Iceland 
and Spitzbergen. All these are imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner. 

Mr. J. Redding Ware's " Passing English of the 
Victorian Era" (Dutton) is a dictionary of slang as 
now current among our English cousins. The entries 
are illustrated by quotations, and the book, while serving 
a serious purpose, will also be found highly entertaining. 
The flavor of the examples is of course insular, but 
American readers will not find themselves wholly at 
sea in the pages of this dictionary. " Nark the titter " 
may be a puzzle to us, but " Dam foolishness " and " Up 
to the scratch " will be recognized as old friends. We 
are not quite so sure about "Ticket-skinner," said to 
hail from New York ; it may be as expressive as " Ticket 
scalper," but we have never heard it used on this side 
of the ocean. 



Notes. 



Miss Elizabeth Robins's new novel, announced for 
early publication in the autumn, is to be entitled " The 
Florentine Frame." The scene is New York City and 
the characters are all American. 

To the " Tudor and Stuart Library " of reprints, pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde, has been added " Wilson's 
Arte of Rhetorique, 1560," edited by Mr. G. H. Mair, 
who writes an elaborate critical introduction. 

The " Agricola " of Tacitus, edited by Professor 
Duane Reed Stuart, is a new volume of " Macmillan's 
Latin Classics." The thirty pages of text get over a 
hundred pages of notes and commentary, which is cer- 
tainly a liberal measure. 

" De Quincey's Literary Criticism," edited by Mr. H. 
Darbishire, and published by Mr. Henry Frowde, is a 
volume of extracts from that brilliant but erratic | 
writer, including chapters on Pope, Milton, Words- 
worth, Southey, Lamb, and Landor, besides the essay 
on " Rhetoric " in the guise of a review of Whateley's 
text-book.

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish " Essentials of Public 
Speaking for Secondary Schools," by Messrs. Robert L. 
Fulton and Thomas C. Trueblood; and an " Elementary 
Modern Chemistry," the work of Messrs. Wilhelm 
Ostwald and Harry W. Morse. 

Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. publish " A Secondary 
Arithmetic, Commercial and Industrial," the work of 
Messrs. John C. Stone and James F. Millis. The prob- 
lems are numerous, and of the strictly practical character 
demanded by the conditions of modern business. 

A biography of the late Professor Simon Xewcomb 
is being prepared by his daughter, Mrs. Anita Newcomb 
McGee, who invites assistance from any of his friends 
who may have letters from or reminiscences of him to 
contribute. Her address is 1620 P St., Washington, D. C. 

" Light and Sound," by Messrs. William S. Franklin 
and Barry Macnutt, is a college text-book of physics 
recently published by the Macmillan Co. It combines 
advanced theoretical discussion with a wholesome ten- 
dency to keep the practical application constantly in 
view. 

" Spanish tales for Beginners," edited by Professor 
Elijah C. Hills, is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co. It includes both short stories and poems, and has 
the usual notes and vocabulary. Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co. publish a volume of " Spanish Anecdotes," edited 
by Messrs. W. F. Giese and C. D. Cool. 

Fraulein Ida Louise Benecke, with permission given 
her many years ago by George Meredith, has published 
a German translation of his story of Lassalle and Helene 
von Racowitza, and we now acknowledge the receipt of 
" Die Trigischen Komodaanten " from Messrs. Siegle, 
Hill, & Co., London. This translator is not, however, 
the first in the field, since a German version of the work 
by Fraulein Julie Sotteck appeared in Berlin a year ago. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. are all the time 
discovering new categories of things that " every child 
should know." We are not sure about all of their groups, 
but when it comes to "Wild Flowers Every Child Should 
Know " there can be no doubt of the usefulness of the 
guide. Mr. Frederic William Stack is the author of 
this book, which adopts a simple color classification, and 
is attractively illustrated with photographic plates, some 
of them colored. 

"Theodore Roosevelt, Dynamic Geographer" — it is 
a novel appellation, and it forms the title of a pamphlet 
published by Mr. Henry Frowde. The author, Mr. 
Frank Buffington Yrooman, simply means by it that 
Mr. Roosevelt has set out to conserve the natural 
resources of the United States, and his summary of 
the progress made, and largely due to Mr. Roosevelt's 
initiative, is now printed upon the basis of a lecture 
given last March at Oxford. 

The Columbia University " Studies in History, Eco- 
nomics, and Public Law " yield a new group of mono- 
graphs, six in number, rather exceptional in their 
interest. They are as follows : " An Introduction to 
the Sources Relating to the Germanic Invasions," by 
Dr. Carlton Huntley Hayes; "Transportation and 
Industrial Development in the Middle West," by 
Dr. Wilham F. Gerhardt; "Social Reform and the 
Reformation," by Dr. Jacob Salwyn Schapiro; "Re- 
sponsibility for Crime," by Dr. Philip A. Parsons; " The 
Conflict over Judicial Powers in the United States to 
1870," by Dr. Charles Grove Haines; and "A Study 
of the Population of Manhattanville," by Dr. Howard 
Brown Woolston.

TEE MOST MONSTROUS FABLE IN 
THE WORLD 



One of the most curious freaks of human 
intelligence is the instinct to attribute any 
remarkable thing or work to somebody else than 
the person who did it. There are of course 
occasions when it is right to suspect a " ghost," 
but men overdo suspicion. " Garth did not 
write his own Dispensary," sings Pope, ironi- 
cally. Homer did not write the " Iliad "; 
Thomas a Kempis did not write the " Imita- 
tion "; Emily Bronte did not write " Wuthering 
Heights "; General Grant did not write his 
Memoirs. 

As a rule, this instinct has its root in envy. 
Like the aspiring youth who fired the Ephesian 
dome, the people who possess it, knowing they 
are incapable of doing anything great them- 
selves, are determined to take those who can 
down a peg. They do not seem to see that, 
the works remaining, the wonder remains. In 
the case of Shakespeare and Bacon they only 
add to the wonder by their inexplicable sugges- 
tions. Bacon wears a massy crown of his own, 
and to give him Shakespeare's would be to create 
a power out of nature. 

However, it is not necessary to fall back on 
this instinct of jealousy to account for the 
Baconian craze. The supremacy of Shake- 
speare's works themselves has been attacked of 
late by a good many leaders in literature — 
Count Tolstoy, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. Ho wells, 
Mark Twain, to name no more. The same set 
or current seems to be drifting others against 
the man Shakespeare. As their arguments, 
though bizarre enough, are by no means novel, 
so the answer to them must be a twice-told tale. 
But it seems necessary to make it. 

The one giant obsession of their minds is what 
they take to be the profound learning displayed 
in Shakespeare's works. Bacon, they say, must 
have known a great deal more than Shakespeare. 
Doubtless in some realms he did. But it is 
admitted by everybody that whoever wrote the 
plays was a mighty genius. Now genius is 
capable of almost anything, and surely it is 
capable of the acquisition of mere knowledge, 
which the dullest, by dint of industry, can attain 
to. And the learning in the plays is by no means 



114 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



what the Baconians imagine it to be. They 
claim, for instance, that these works are evi- 
dently the productions of a trained and profound 
lawyer. Let us see. 

There is a strong probability that Shake- 
speare served some time, in his youth, as a law 
clerk. The accusation was brought against him 
soon after his arrival in London. Now the law 
which he is proficient in — the law of property 
dealings, actions for trespass and dispossession, 
the law of commercial intercourse — is just the 
kind of law that he might have picked up in a 
country lawyer's office. And he tosses its terms 
about as though proud of such new-discovered 
riches — as though putting his whole wealth 
in the show-window. Bacon, on the contrary, 
— if I may trust my readings of his works, — 
seldom uses law-terms or illustrations. He 
writes as one assured of being a classic, who is 
above business, cant, or slang words. Later 
in life, Shakespeare's property interests would 
have confirmed him in a knowledge of this 
kind of law. Thousands of laymen since have 
acquired a larger stock of knowledge than the 
writer of the plays need have possessed. It is 
hard to think that a sound lawyer would have 
based a plot on the preposterous law of " The 
Merchant of Venice." 

But of the old law, — the great law of En- 
gland, the law that is embodied in Littleton's 
Institutes, a treatise which Sir Edward Coke was 
moved to declare " the most perfect and absolute 
work ever written in any science," — of this law, 
Shakespeare knew nothing. Making a list of 
about thirty of the major words and law terms 
of this work, and going through the Shakespeare 
Concordance, we can find only two of the most 
common of them. Of course, if Shakespeare 
did not use the law terms he did not discuss the 
law matter. 

There is another species of law, the law of 
nations and of kingly inheritance, with which in 
his historical plays Shakespeare does show ac- 
quaintance. But, as Mr. Churton Collins has 
pointed out, the passages where he deals with 
this are taken mainly from his authorities, gen- 
erally with only enough change to turn prose 
into verse. Shakespeare is no more responsible 
for the law of such passages than for the exist- 
ence of the historical personages themselves. 

As with Shakespeare's law, so with his other 
learning — excepting only his close knowledge 
of nature and country customs, of which there 
is not a trace in Bacon. Shakespeare's knowl- 
edge was wide, varied, and vivid ; but it was 
never exact, minute, scholarly. It was, again, 



such knowledge as a great intelligence would 
pick up from casual or purposed reading, con- 
versation, and experience of life. There is such 
a thing as a paralysis of learning ; as witness 
Gray and Landor. Shakespeare's was the kind 
which the greatest poets have instinctively aimed 
at. Lowell says that when Goethe wanted any 
facts about antiquity, he would take a ruminating 
Professor of Greek or Sanscrit aside and quietly 
milk him. No doubt Shakespeare did the same. 
His knowledge, however, is more flawed and 
questionable than that of more cautious modern 
poets. Bacon would have shuddered at some of 
the blunders, historical, geographical, or liter- 
ary, which Shakespeare makes. I have read 
the English version of all of Bacon's works, 
and I can recall no error of grammar in them, as 
grammar was practised then. But, as everybody 
knows, Shakespeare's grammar is a law to itself. 

There is, I think, a class feeling growing up 
among the educated and patrician class against 
Shakespeare. They believe that Shakespeare did 
not belong to them, and that Bacon did. As an 
argument against genius, this is of course an 
absurdity. The two English poets, Burns and 
Keats, who perhaps come nearest to Shakespeare 
in vividness of realization and gift of language 
were of far lower extraction than he was, and one 
of them was of practically no book education at 
all. But let us see how the case for gentility 
stands between Shakespeare and Bacon. 

The name of Shakespeare has certainly a 
noble sound, and, despite the numerous bearers 
of it scattered over England, most of them in 
the poorer walks of life, it is at least possible 
that some remote ancestor may have been of 
noble blood. Shakespeare's father certainly got 
a coat of arms. Such transactions have always 
been open to question, but it is purely gratuitous 
to assert that the Heralds were wrong in grant- 
ing it. No direct attack was made on it at the 
time, though some other like grants were ridi- 
culed. Even if there had been a query of it, 
we at this late day could not tell whether this 
was not due to envy and malice. As it is, 
Shakespeare is in possession. His enemies must 
prove an ouster, which so far they have not done. 
On his mothers side, fortunately, there is no 
doubt. It is generally conceded that Mary Arden 
was of long and gentle descent. The genealogist 
traces her back to Alfred the Great. 

Now, what of Bacon's descent ? His father, 
Sir Nicholas Bacon, was a distinguished man, 
the Lord Keeper of the Seals. But his grand- 
father was a tutor who acquired a Prince's favor. 
Bacon's mother's name was Cooke. Shake-

THE DIAL

speare and Arden, Bacon and Cooke, — what a 
contrast of cognomens ! 

Another delusion about Bacon is that he was 
from the first a great and powerful nobleman, 
quite able and willing to fling away such trifles 
as the Shakespearian plays. As a matter of fact 
he was. until the succession of James in 1603, 
a struggling lawyer and courtier, laboring under 
the disfavor of Elizabeth and the rivalry of a 
greater lawyer, Sir Edward Coke. In 1598, 
when Shakespeare must have been entering into 
the enjoyment of an income which Mr. Sidney 
Lee estimates as equal to 635,000 a year now, 
Bacon was arrested for debt. If there is any- 
thing absolutely established about Bacon's char- 
acter, it is that he was greedy in the extreme — 
venal. He accepted presents from anyone who 
would give them ; and he took bribes. Is it 
conceivable that such a man would give away 
works that were mainly responsible for Shake- 
speare's princely income ? 

But it is urged that Shakespeare took no care 
of his works, — did not bring out an edition of 
them. Well, neither did Bacon. The latter 
was alive when the First Folio was published 
with all its horrors on its head — blunders, omis- 
sions, bad arrangement. Anyone who knows an 
author's sensitiveness as to misprints and mis- 
takes in his published works will accept the fact 
that Bacon did not secretly or otherwise exercise 
any supervision over the folio, as good proof that 
he had nothing to do with its contents. Shake- 
speare died suddenly, at a comparatively early 
age. His plays belonged to the theatre, and he 
probably could not have brought them out had 
he wished to. 

We have said above that the author of the 
Plays was unquestionably a great genius, and 
that genius is capable of almost anything. Is it 
more incredible that Shakespeare, decently born, 
decently bred, should have been able to acquire 
the knowledge exhibited in his plays than that 
a starveling Corsican lieutenant, without money, 
without friends, should have been able in ten 
years to make himself master of Europe ? 

But the chief evidence for Shakespeare, to 
those competent to judge, is internal. The differ- 
ence between the minds of Shakespeare and 
Bacon, between their tempers, their ideals, as 
expressed in their works, is as great as between 
any two men or any two sets of productions in 
the history of the world. They are antipodal. 
It is the contrast between the metaphysical 
and poetic mind and the historical and scientific 
mind. Lord Bacon's boast that he had taken all 
knowledge for his province is ill-founded; for 



he evidently knew comparatively little about 
pure literature, and not much more about pure 
philosophy. He called the metaphysical sciences 
barren virgins. He was a utilitarian, a scientist 
almost of the modern type. He had largeness 
and greatness in his style, and his dreams of the 
future of science are grandiose ; but he declined 
to meddle with the things of the spirit, the 
emotions of the soul. Shakespeare, whether he 
had much reading in philosophy or not, is meta- 
physical by bent. He throws himself into all 
emotions and passions, and the great questions 
of life and death and the hereafter haunt him 
eternally. Lord Bacon got his death by getting 
out of his carriage to stuff some snow into a fowl, 
to see if that would preserve it. Perhaps here 
was the germ of our modern cold-storage sys- 
tems ; but can we imagine the creator of Hamlet 
thinking of such a thing ? 

Lord Bacon left some verses. If any critic 
can believe that they were written by the hand 
that wrote Shakespeare's poetry, then King 
Midas has a lineal descendant. 

Lord Bacon, interested in many things, gath- 
ered together in his Apothegms a large number 
of witty or humorous stories. Some of them are 
really good ; but they are told in so dry a style, 
with such an absence of unction or lightness, 
that we can only think of the creator of Falstaff 
reading them with despair. 

Lord Bacon also attempted a romance. " The 
New Atlantis " is a philosophical story, whose 
central idea has merit. But dreary abstractions 
take the place of personages, and there is only 
the vaguest realization of scene or action. 

One of the most remarkable characteristics 
of the Plays is their stagecraft — the knowl- 
edge of stage effects and stage business which 
permeates them. They have been tested for 
three hundred years, under all conditions, and 
have outlived most of the theatre-pieces of the 
world largely by reason of this skill and knowl- 
edge. It is improbable, to say the least, that 
anyone but a man intimately familiar with 
the stage, its methods and secrets, could have 
wrought this miracle. Certainly Francis Bacon 
had no such experience. 

But enough. The best answer to the Ba- 
conian balderdash is silence. And the men most 
competent to speak have practically adopted it. 
Dr. Georg Brandes, in his monumental Life of 
Shakespeare, gives a paragraph to the question. 
Mr. Sidney Lee gives it a note of a page or so. 
Mr. Walter Raleigh does not mention the matter 
at all. Dr. Furness, 1 believe, has never chosen 
to discuss it. But mischief is being done. By 



116 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



constant reiteration the delusion is effecting a 
lodgment in the public mind. The newspapers 
joke or equivocate about it. People think there 
must be something in a claim which is so dinned 
in their ears. 

If Lord Bacon had made any claim to the 
works, if any contemporary or writer in the 
next generation had hinted at it, there might be 
a case stated — Lord Bacon might have an 
arguable interest in the works. But nothing 
of the sort happened. It was reserved for the 
last sixty years to unearth this mare's nest and 
exploit it with an expenditure of ink and paper 
which makes it the most monstrous fable of the 
world. The intolerable injustice of the attempt 
made to rob one of the world's supreme bene- 
factors of his reputation and glory does not 
seem to strike anyone.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Echoes of the Tennyson centenary cele- 
bration, just passed, are many and diverse. The 
most interesting contributions to the occasion come 
from those who knew Tennyson and are able to give 
some personal impressions or recollections of him. 
Of this number is Colonel T. W. Higginson, who 
visited the poet at Farringford in 1872, and now 
for the first time gives (in the Boston ft Transcript") 
an account of the event — he having conscientiously 
refrained from publishing it heretofore by reason of 
an assurance he had given his host that he had not 
come for the purpose of gathering literary material. 
But the narrative has not spoiled by keeping. Mr. 
Higginson describes the poet as " the very most un- 
English looking man " he had yet encountered, and 
adds : " He was tall, high-shouldered, careless in 
dress and in attitude, yet most striking and com- 
manding in figure. With an unusually high and 
dome-like forehead, he had beneath it brilliant black 
eyes and tangled grayish hair and beard, which, as 
I find recorded in my diary, ' gave him rather the 
air of a partially reformed Corsican bandit or else 
an imperfectly secularized Carmelite monk than that 
of a decorous and well-groomed English citizen.' " 
After a momentary dissatisfaction at failing to per- 
suade his visitor to smoke with him in his study, the 
host led the way to the garden, where the two " sat 
down beneath a large tree, and he talked quite freely 
about his own books, reciting little passages here and 
there. He reminded me," says Colonel Higginson, 
"of descriptions of "Wordsworth, whom I had never 
seen ; that is, of a man rather too isolated in his 
daily life and too much absorbed in his own fancies. 
Lord Houghton, his lifelong friend, said to me after- 
wards, ' Tennyson asks unmixed flattery.' This I 
should not venture to say ; but I observed that when 



speaking of other men, he would mention as an 
important trait in their characters the fact whether 
they liked his poems or not. Lowell, as Tennyson 
evidently thought, did not appreciate him. Perhaps 
this distrust is a habit of all authors, and it was only 
that Tennyson spoke out, in a rather childish way, 
what others might have kept back." Much more 
serious than the amiable weaknesses depicted by Col- 
onel Higginson are some faults of character brought 
out in an article on " The Human Side of Tennyson " 
in " The Bookman " for August. The writer charges 
not only that the poet sometimes showed "selfish- 
ness and perhaps ingratitude," but had " a strong 
vein of coarseness " in his nature. An incident given 
in illustration is not very convincing — one which 
the writer thinks "has never before been printed," 
whereas it has been in print for twenty-five years or 
more, although in its present form it is so badly told 
that the effect is changed and the point well-nigh 
lost. The story, which many of our readers doubt- 
less have heard or read, is that of a somewhat 
heated discussion between Tennyson and Carlyle, 
in which the former had driven the irascible hero- 
worshipper into a defence of the hated Norman 
Conqueror and his depredations upon English soil ; 
to which Tennyson had retorted by giving pretty 
forcible expression to his notion of what would have 
happened to the invader " if he had come around my 
premises with your d — d doctrine that might makes 
right." In other words, that was a game that two 
could play at. Tennyson's expression was energetic, 
even fierce ; but it did not necessarily imply coarse- 
ness, any more than the execution of the savage 
threat would have indicated coarseness in a man 
who stood as the defender of his home and land. 
More astonishing still is the same writer's statement, 
made without qualification of any sort, that " when 
Longfellow first visited Tennyson the Englishman 
entertained him for an hour or more with the nar- 
ration of obscene stories." This is certainly going 
pretty far in the study of " personality." It has 
been said that Lincoln, in his fondness for story- 
telling, did not always draw the line at delicacy ; but 
we have never heard that he could tell "obscene 
stories " by the hour to a perfect stranger and a 
gentleman of obvious refinement and distinction who 
was his guest. The chances are that the Longfellow 
incident has been greatly exaggerated and distorted, 
and does not at all warrant the sweeping statement 
that in Tennyson was to be found " a strong vein of 
coarseness that belonged to the very nature of the 
man." ... 

The tragedy of Victor Hugo's daughter is 
recalled by the preparations now in process for a 
grand Hugo celebration this month in Paris, on 
the occasion of the unveiling of a new statue of the 
French author by Rodin. The day chosen is the 
26th, the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of 
" La Legende des Sihcles "; and among other fes- 
tivities there will be a revival of " Le Roi s' Amuse " 
at the Com^die Francaise, where a box will be re-

served for Adele Hugo, the poet's daughter, whose 
tragic and mysterious history rivals in interest any 
romance of her father's. In her girlhood she was 
kidnapped — so the story runs — and carried away 
from her home in the isle of Guernsey. Europe was 
searched in vain for her by the distracted parents, 
hut after several months they received word of her 
from a different and unexpected quarter. In the 
streets of New York a girl had been found wander- 
ing alone and apparently demented, answering all 
inquiries with "I am the daughter of Victor Hugo," 
and nothing more. She was sent back to her home, 
but with wide-staring eyes she remained dumb to all 
questioning as to her disappearance, except to repeat 
the assertion of her parentage. Never wholly re- 
covering her reason, she has lived a life of gloom 
and solitude in her father's villa, occasionally visit- 
ing Paris to witness from the back of a darkened box 
one of his plays, but having no friends and receiving 
no visitors. ... 

The scope of a city library's beneficent 
activities is acknowledged to be wide, despite the 
occasional indulgence on the part of some less wise 
librarian, or children's librarian, in what may rea- 
sonably be judged to partake of foolishness and trivi- 
ality. A good example of vigorous and effective 
energy exerted in various legitimate directions is 
furnished by the Free Public Library of Newark. 
New Jersey. " The work of the library," writes 
Mr. Dana, in his latest report of progress, " is not 
confined to the lending of books. The main build- 
ing is far more spacious, relatively to the size of the 
city and the number of volumes, than any public 
library building in the country — to say nothing of 
its advantages in conveniences and attractiveness ; 
and through the generous policy in regard to its use 
which the trustees have adopted and the city has 
approved, this building has become a centre for no 
small amount of literary, philanthropic, art, science, 
civic, and general educational activity. This is 
shown in a measure by the gatherings for mutual 
and public welfare and improvement held here in 
1908, which reached a total of 662, with about 
22,106 in attendance ; and by the 15 exhibits of the 
year, with an attendance of 30,000." Especially 
noteworthy is the Newark system of numerous 
branches and deposit stations, there being in all now 
324 such centres of distribution for the convenience 
of book-borrowers. . . . 

Misspelling among the educated, or the sup- 
posedly educated, is apparently on the increase — 
thanks, it may be, to the passing of the " spelling 
bee " and to the crowding of the school curriculum 
with a multitude of studies unknown and undreamt- 
of by our sturdy ancestors ; and thanks also, perhaps, 
to the present movement for phonetic spelling, which 
the indolent are tempted to interpret as " spelling 
as you please." In a statistical analysis of the spell- 
ing of his students, Professor William B. Bailey of 
Yale makes some startling revelations. Of 171 
essays written by seniors and juniors, only twenty- 



five were orthographically correct, while fourteen 
per 'cent contained each ten or more misspelled 
words, and one heterographic genius achieved thirty- 
one mistakes of this sort. There were 443 mis- 
spellings in all, and six especially troublesome words 
were " separate," " superintendent," " governor," 
"committee," "comptroller," and "privilege," the 
last masquerading as privalege, privilige, priviledge, 
privelege, privilidge, and privaledge. Certainly the 
later years of a course in a great university are not 
the occasion for remedying the deficiencies of ele- 
mentary studies in the common schools. HI fares 
the school, to latest fads a prey, where courses multi- 
ply and the three R's decay. 

• • • 

The artistic aspect of things, it is encourag- 
ing to be assured by Mr. Henry T. Bailey, of the 
national Bureau of Education, is not altogether 
eclipsed in this money-making country by the com- 
mercial and industrial and practical aspect. In a 
statistical account of the millions that go every year 
for art and art instruction, it appears that a round 
million is spent in subscriptions to art periodicals, 
and half as much in the support of our summer 
art schools. Two millions and a half are received 
yearly by private schools of fine and applied art, 
and about the same amount by teachers of art in 
other schools and colleges. Massachusetts and New 
York take the lead in every branch of art education, 
but the other States are moving forward rather than 
backward in this department of liberal culture. 

Unworked Shakespearian mines still await 
the delver in Shakespearian lore, despite the tons 
of literature that the immortal dramas have already 
inspired. A recent Danish work, by Mr. August 
Goll, on " Criminal Types in Shakespeare " is 
spoken of as possessing interest of a novel kind. Its 
author, failing to find in Lombroso and in studies of 
actual criminals the data he desired, resorted at last 
to the imaginary but ever-living types of rascality 
to be met with in Shakespeare's pages ; and the 
results of his researches ought to be especially wel- 
come at this time, if only as proof that in Shake- 
speare's works we do, after all, possess something 
more than a puzzle-book of ciphers and cryptograms. 

A faithful portrait-painter of the North 
American Indian is treating his readers to pen- 
pictures of the vanishing redskin's manners and 
customs, of a sort that greatly contents many of us 
to whom Cooper's artificial and impossible Indian 
and conventional and hackneypd plots are unbear- 
able. Mark Twain's well-known strictures on the 
author of the Leather-stocking tales conspicuously 
fail to apply to Mr. Frederick R. Burton, author, 
musician, and composer, who has lived among the 
Ojibways, studying their music and their morals, 
their character and their traditions, and whose "Red- 
cloud of the Lakes " (as in a lesser degree also his 
earlier " Strongheart ") is a noteworthy production, 
full of high purpose and absorbing interest.

COMMEMOBATIOXS OF EDGAR ALLAX POE.* 

It is not too much to say that most of the 
books and critical articles on Poe published in 
this his centenary year have been a negligible 
quantity. This has been true of what has ap- 
peared in French and English reviews, as well 
as of what we have written in Poe's own gas- 
lighted Philistia. The romance of the life was 
written by the poet himself, and by those ear- 
lier admirers for whom he wore a green halo. 
Then came the Griswolds and their like, on the 
one hand ; and, on the other, extravagant ad- 
mirers and apologists like Mr. Didier. Last of 
all came the opportunity of the critical biog- 
rapher, whose privilege it is to clear the life of 
its legends and to arrive at its facts. This is 
just what Professor Woodberry essayed to do 
some years ago, in his memoir of Poe contrib- 
uted to the " American Men of Letters " series ; 
and in the new two- volume biography which he 
calls "Personal and Literary" he takes several 
steps further in the same direction: seeking 
to represent a Poe who was neither hero nor 
superman nor scoundrel, merely a man of un- 
questioned intellectual force, of keen analytical 
powers, of intense if never very varied imagin- 
ation, — a man lacking only in that fine some- 
thing that may or may not accompany genius, 
moral strength. 

The enlargement of the memoir which he 
wrote more than twenty-five years ago has given 
Professor Woodberry the opportunity to include 
here an increased quantity of material descrip- 
tive of that sad career. We realize more than 
ever how the poet's life was forever embarrassed 
and troubled, and with what a whole soul Poe 
could cry out, " To coin one's brain into silver, 
at the nod of a master, is, to my thinking, the 
hardest task in the world." 

" Most wretched men 
Are cradled into poetry by wrong: 
They learn in suffering what they teach in song." 

And yet it is not solely in biographic detail

that Professor Woodberry's memoir has been 
enriched in the rewriting. Thus, in the earlier 
biography the name of Hoffmann does not so 
much as appear ; while in the first of the two 
new volumes several pages are given to an ex- 
amination of Poe's possible debt to or kinship 
with the German romancer. Professor Wood- 
berry is skeptical here. " It is essential," he 
writes, " to show Poe's contact with Hoffmann 
before that time," the time, that is, of the pub- 
lication of " The Visionary," in October, 1833. 
He adds : 

"This contact could not have been direct; it is as 
little likely to have been in French [sic], the only 
translation at that time being of the date 1830, issued 
at Brussels, and Poe's chances of encountering it being 
remote indeed. What he knew of Hoffmann, there- 
fore, may safely be referred to magazine notices of that 
writer and other German romancers. . . . Hoffmann 
was at most only one of many contemporary influences 
playing upon Poe's receptive and pliable genius, and 
the knowledge Poe had of him must have been of the 
slightest, as none was available except through Carlyle 
and Scott, who had brought him forward in 1827 in 
English reviews." 

Carlyle's article on the German novelists belongs, 
all the same, to the year 1825 ; nor does Pro- 
fessor Woodberry note the fact that as early as 
1824 there appeared in Blackwood's a transla- 
tion of " Die Elixiere des Teufels," sometimes 
associated with " William Wilson "; that in 1826 
"The Lost Reflection" ["Die Geschichte vom 
Verlornen Spiegelbilde"] figured in the "Boston 
Athenaeum, or Spirit of the English Magazines"; 
and that in the same year no less than three of 
Hoffmann's tales appeared at London in trans- 
lation, " Das Fraulein von Scudery," " Das Ma- 
jorat," "Meister Floh." The biographer refers 
to the four- volume translation of Hoffmann pub- 
lished at Brussels in 1830, as the first French 
translation. Publication of the well-known 
Loeve-Veimars version of the tales was none the 
less begun at Paris in 1829 (to be concluded 
four years later); and publication of a transla- 
tion by Toussuel was begun in the year 1830. 
To suggest that Poe's opportunities of knowing 
Hoffmann were at least larger than Professor 
Woodberry leads his readers to suppose, is, how- 
ever, very far from claiming that Poe " was mis- 
placed in America ... a German born out of 
due latitude, a Hoffmann come into the world 
in a land of alien ways and spirit." 

The earlier memoir, as has been suggested, 
is the basis of the two volumes now published 
— their more or less fleshy skeleton. In mod- 
ernizing his former work, Mr. Woodberry has 
found it necessary to modify very few of his 
opinions ; he has, however, dealt more fully 



1909.] 



THE DIAL

with the question of Poe's weaknesses and with 
the controversial aspects of his subject, — for 
he has everywhere used a greater amplitude of 
detail. The study of Poe gains, by this method, 
as a record of fact, as a repository of much 
useful information : here, be it confessed, rather 
than in firmness or proportion. Professor Wood- 
berry seems to have found it impossible to 
incorporate all of his material in these volumes : 
each volume is swelled by undigested notes in 
the form of appendices, along with various 
pieces justicatives and unpublished letters. 
As an encyclopaedia of the professional and 
private adventures of Poe, this new memoir is 
indeed of the highest value. It is Professor 
Woodberry's modest suggestion that while 
•• there will be other lives of Poe " he will be 
content " to have here edited with care the 
materials for his life," making easier the way 
of the future " ideal biographer.*' This sen- 
tence has phrased the final criticism of the book 
before us. 

A newspaper paragrapher has justly enough 
remarked that some critics know better what 
Poe drank than what he wrote. Chacun son 
gout. Some find the details of a poet's amours 
no less attractive. We have had minute ac- 
counts of *• George Sand and her Lovers," of 
" Rousseau and the Women he Loved," ad 
nauseam. In Poe's case this kind of interest 
centres upon his relations with the various 
" poetesses," both before and after Virginia's 
death. It is true that no one in recent years has 
questioned the fidelity of Poe to his child- wife. 

One of Professor Woodberry's chapters is, 
then, devoted to Helen Whitman. It will be 
remembered that the Rhode Island poetess was 
one of the two women whom Poe asked to marry 
him in the period of his widowerhood. It seems 
a great pity that these matters ever became the 
subject of controversy or even of discussion. 
They reflect no credit on any side — though the 
scandals which mischief-makers have sought to 
weave around them have fallen flat enough. 
In giving his account of Mrs. Whitman, and in 
quoting Poe's letters to her, written in the year 
1848, the biographer has been obliged to follow 
the incomplete and garbled versions of Poe's 
letters supplied by Ingram. Now, however, 
we have " The Last Letters of Poe to Sarah 
Helen Whitman," edited by Professor Harrison, 
and published " under the auspices of the Uni- 
versity of Virginia." Professor Harrison writes 
that in foreign countries it is the custom to 
celebrate the jubilee of a distinguished author 
by a Festschrift, " or Literary Memorial of 



some kind containing unpublished data, original 
research, or memorabilia of a notable kind"; 
and that " it seemed appropriate that the Alma 
Mater of Edgar Allan Poe should carry out 
this graceful custom in honor of his Hundredth 
Birthday." The memorial volume is hand- 
somely printed, and very scrupulously prepared 
from the original manuscripts ; its text is pre- 
ceded by a reproduction of the unfamiliar 
miniature of Poe painted when he was aged 
twenty-six — the earliest known portrait. It 
is none the less difficult to share Professor 
Harrison's enthusiasm for these letters, that 
" rival the ' Sonnets from the Portuguese ' or 
the letters of Abelard and Heloi'se in interest 
and eloquence." Their issue serves at least to 
emphasize the inaccuracy of the portions of 
these " Last Letters " previously reproduced — 
to emphasize certain inaccuracies even in Pro- 
fessor Woodberry's book. Words altered by 
the meddlesome Ingram ; passages suppressed 
without indication of the fact ; mistaken dates, 
— these remain to be corrected in the reprinting 
of the fourteenth chapter of this latest biog- 
raphy. Professor Woodberry attributes also to 
Miss Anna Blackwell, and not to Miss Lynch, 
the description of Mrs. Whitman given to Poe 
before his meeting her, referred to by him in 
his letter of October 1, 1848, which is repro- 
duced in part (undated) on pages 266—267. 
These are matters of detail, however ; the biog- 
rapher's general statements remain true enough. 
" Poe had made up his mind," is the conclusion, 
" to adopt Mrs. Shew's advice, and to try to 
save himself in what she had declared the only 
possible way, — marriage. He meant to extri- 
cate himself from his poverty by marrying a 
woman with property. This was his practical 
plan, wholly aside from his entanglement with 
any particular woman ; but he worked it out 
under the conditions of his temperament. He 
had found romantic attachments consistent with 
his previous marriage, and he did not consider 
them inconsistent with his wooing. He was irre- 
sponsible"; and, besides, "the contact of such 
abnormal natures as Poe and Mrs. Whitman 
was full of danger." 

There is every reason to accept Professor 
Woodberry's affirmation that his attack upon 
some of the questions raised here was rather 
against his will — that it is only the circumstance 
that so many lies have been told that makes it 
worth while to tell the whole truth. As far as 
these last matters go, they only remind us of what 
Ik Marvel wrote, — words quoted in The Dial. 
only a few months since. " He was never the

culmination of his troubles. " It were better, 
perhaps, if the story of it all had never been

ginning, it never would have been told. Yet, 
since part has been repeated, it is well that we 
should now have it all out and done with. And 
if the story is not, even to-day, complete, it is 
as fully documented as it is ever likely to be.

A Famous Chapter in Amerkan 
Politics.* 



Professor Ray's book on the origin of the 
repeal of the Missouri Compromise treats of 
so important a subject, and brings together so 
much new contemporary newspaper evidence, 
that it will be of great interest both to the pro- 
fessional student and to the intelligent reader 
of American history. In a speech at Atchison, 
Kansas, during the fall following the repeal of 
the Compromise, Senator Atchison claimed for 
himself the credit of having originated that 
measure, asserting that he had required that 
Douglas should either resign the chairmanship 
of the Senate Committee on Territories or bring 
in the bill. Atchison was reported to be under 
the influence of liquor when he made the speech, 
and his claim has usually been regarded by his- 
torians as the braggadocio of a drunken man. 
Professor Ray finds in it, however, the key 
with which to unlock the mystery of the origin 
of the Repeal. 

By way of background to his narrative he 
gives an account of the movement in Missouri 
politics which resulted in the retirement of 
Benton from the United States Senate. The 
first attempt to defeat Benton was made by 
the Calhoun faction in 1844 ; but the attempt 
failed. The opposition to Benton next showed 
itself in 1847. The Bentonites carried through 
the Missouri legislature a series of resolutions 
affirming the Missouri Compromise. The oppo- 
sition replied with counter-resolutions denounc- 
ing the Compromise and asserting that the right 
to prohibit slavery in a territory belonged exclu- 
sively to the people thereof, and could be exer- 
cised only when forming a State Constitution. 
These resolutions, defeated in 1847, were car- 
ried in 1849. Benton immediately issued an 
" Appeal " from the instructions contained in 

* The Repeal of the Missouri Compromise : Its 
Origin and Authorship. By P. Orman Ray, Ph.D. 
Cleveland : The Arthur H. Clark Co. 



them, and replied in a famous speech at Jef- 
ferson City, the substance of which he repeated 
throughout the State. The issue was the val- 
idity of the Missouri Compromise ; and on this 
issue Benton was defeated for reelection to the 
Senate. 

In 1853, the Richardson bill for the organ- 
ization of Nebraska as free territory passed 
the House, but failed in the Senate. In the 
Senate, Atchison supported the bill, despite 
its recognition of the validity of the Missouri 
Compromise, explaining afterward that he did 
so at the urgent request of a colleague. Imme- 
diately thereafter, Benton began a campaign 
to secure his own return to the Senate as 
Atchison's successor. As a platform, he de- 
clared for a Central Pacific Railway and the 
organization of Nebraska as a free territory, and 
appealed to Western land-thirst by asserting that 
Nebraska was immediately to be opened to set- 
tlement. Atchison retorted by an appeal to the 
pro-slavery sentiment of Missouri, declaring 
that he would not vote for the organization of 
Nebraska as free territory. Meanwhile the 
Wyandott Indians organized the Provisional 
Government of Nebraska, and mass-meetings in 
Missouri and Iowa memorialized Congress for 
the organization of the territory. This was 
the situation when the first session of the thirty- 
third Congress met. 

Professor Ray has done good service in show- 
ing that the Nebraska issue was forced upon 
Douglas by frontier conditions, and that the 
issue between a free and a slave territory, 
between affirming and repudiating the Missouri 
Compromise, had already been made in Mis- 
souri. He has also shown that Douglas's prior 
interest in the organization of Nebraska was less 
than has been supposed, and he has collected 
newspaper comments that indicate that Atchi- 
son's connection with the Kansas-Nebraska bill 
was greater than has been supposed. Further 
than this we are unable to follow him. We can- 
not think that Atchison was in any real sense 
the author of the repeal of the Missouri Com- 
promise. The issue of organizing Nebraska was 
made in Missouri by Benton. The bill for its 
organization was introduced in the Senate by 
Dodge of Iowa, and was referred to Douglas's 
committee. Atchison very probably urged 
Douglas to repeal the Missouri Compromise. 
The two are represented by one newspaper to 
have been personal friends. It is not at all 
probable that Atchison could have displaced 
Douglas as chairman of the Committee on 
Territories, even had he desired to. His influ-

ence in the Senate was slight compared with 
Douglas's, and his position as President pro 
tempore was due solely to his seniority of ser- 
vice. The force of the claim that he made in 
his speech at Atchison is broken by the very 
slight claim that he made in his earlier letter of 
June 5, 1854, and in his later speech at Platte 
City in February of 1856. January 4, 1854, 
Douglas introduced his celebrated report and 
bill. It must be remembered that he did not 
originally intend directly to repeal the Missouri 
Compromise, but to leave the status of the pro- 
posed territory as to slavery in abeyance or in 
effect to the decision of the Supreme Court. 
Professor Ray brings out the interesting fact 
that various newspapers had already urged that 
the Compromise of 1850 repealed that of 1820. 
January 16, Dixon of Kentucky forced Douglas's 
hand by moving a direct repeal. Professor Ray 
thinks Atchison may have inspired Dixon's 
motion ; but this is pure conjecture, and there 
is every reason to think that Dixon acted inde- 
pendently of outside influence. Atchison was 
associated in the Senate with the radical 
Southerners, Mason, Hunter, and Butler, who 
accepted Calhoun's doctrine that Congress could 
neither prohibit slavery in the territories nor 
allow their inhabitants to do so. Douglas's 
bill, both as originally introduced and as subse- 
quently recast in the Democratic caucus, em- 
bodied the doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, and 
this was as much opposed to the Calhoun theory 
as it was to the Missouri restriction. Atchison 
cannot therefore be regarded as the author of a 
measure which was fundamentally opposed to 
his own theories, however much his influence 
may have contributed to bring it about. Pro- 
fessor Ray finds confirmation of his theory of 
Atchison's authorship in a partisan speech made 
by Francis P. Blair, Jr.. in Missouri, in 1854, 
and in Parker's " Secret History *' written in 
1880. But there is no probability that Blair 
could have had inside information in regard to 
the history of the repeal, and Parker's article, 
written thirty-six years after the event, when the 
author was seventy-six years of age, gives no clue 
to the source of his information. Moreover, the 
" History is so inaccurate upon other points 
as to preclude its being regarded as a serious 
authority upon this one. 

The question as to what was Douglas's 
motive remains very much the same as before. 
It is necessarily a matter of pure conjecture, 
since there is no particle of evidence bearing 
upon it. His primary purpose probably was 
to secure the success of the bill, since the fate 



of the Richardson bill had shown that Nebraska 
could not be organized under the Missouri 
restriction. His most probable secondary pur- 
pose seems to have been to compromise opposing 
opinions in his own party with respect to slavery 
in the territories. There is a significant sentence 
in Douglas's private letter of November 11, 1853, 
to Walker and Lamphier : u The party is in 
distracted condition, and it requires all our 
wisdom, prudence, and energy to consolidate 
its power and perpetuate its principles." The 
Whig party had been destroyed by the Compro- 
mise of 1850, and similar destruction threatened 
the Democratic party. Northern Democrats 
insisted upon the power of Congress to prohibit 
slavery in the territories, and Southern Demo- 
crats denied it. Douglas undertook to com- 
promise the opposing opinions by referring 
the question to the inhabitants of the terri- 
tories, as suggested in Cass's Nicholson letter. 
Northern Democrats accepted the compromise 
upon the theory that the inhabitants could act 
during the territorial period, and Southern 
Democrats upon the theory that they could not 
act until the territory was admitted as a State. 
By this expedient, Douglas actually postponed 
the disruption of the Democratic party until 
1860 ; but the political necessity of sustaining 
the Dred Scott decision involved him in a logical 
absurdity from which there was no escape. 
The preservation of the party might ultimately 
redound to Douglas's advantage ; but Professor 
Johnson has shown that, so far as his presiden- 
tial aspirations were concerned, he was under no 
necessity of currying favor with the South. 

Professor Ray devotes an appendix to the 
contention that the organization of Nebraska 
was not bound up with the question of the route 
for a Pacific Railway. In this opinion we can- 
not agree with him. The question involved too 
many interests to make it possible to interpret 
the vote from the standpoint of any one of them. 
The Senate vote on the Richardson bill, however, 
indicates that the two measures were closely con- 
nected ; and the House vote is not unfavorable 
to the same view. In New York, opinion was 
divided. The Erie canal interest favored a 
northern route for the Pacific Railway, and prob- 
ably voted for the organization of Nebraska. 
New York City capital was invested in Panama 
steamship lines, and was promoting the construc- 
tion of the Panama railway ; and on that account 
it was opposed to any trans-continental railroad, 
and to the organization of Nebraska. New 
Orleans capitalists were promoting the Tehuan- 
tepec Railway, which they expected would give

their city the advantages which are now antici- 
pated from the construction of the Panama Canal. 
They were also opposed to any trans-continental 
line. Apart from the Tehuantepec project, the 
interest of Louisiana in the proposed Southern 
Pacific Railroad was slight, since it was to pass 
to the northward and terminate at Charleston, 
S. C. The two Louisiana votes in the House for 
the Richardson bill may have been intended as 
a diversion from the Southern Pacific Railroad, 
which at the time seemed to be almost upon the 
point of construction. Only one Texan vote was 
cast in the House against the Richardson bill ; 
but Texas had but one other representative at 
the time, and he may have been absent or from 
some other cause prevented from voting. The 
remarks of Dodge upon the Douglas bill indicate 
that the division of Nebraska into two territories 
was made partly as a result of the desire of the 
Iowa delegation that the Pacific Railroad should 
pass through their State. Douglas was estopped, 
both before and after the passage of his bill, 
from bringing out the connection between the 
organization of Nebraska and the northern route 
for the Pacific Railroad. If he emphasized the 
importance of the northern, or rather the cen- 
tral, route, he antagonized his friends in the 
South. If he favored a Chicago terminal, he 
sacrificed the interests of his constituents in 
Southern Illinois and laid himself open to the 
charge of favoring his own private interests. If 
he favored a St. Louis terminal he sacrificed his 
own interests and those of his Northern Illinois 
constituents. The dual nature of Douglas's 
Illinois constituency was his greatest difficulty. 
It was one reason for his attempt to find middle 
ground on the subject of slavery, and for his 
silence on the subject of the Pacific Railroad. 
That he was alive to the importance of the latter 
is indicated by his writing Walker and Lamphier 
before the Session began : " The Pacific Rail- 
road will also be a disturbing element." 

Professor Ray anticipates criticism on ac- 
count of the length of the quotations in his 
text ; but we are thankful for all of them, as 
they throw new light upon various phases of 
the Nebraska struggle, particularly upon the 
conference with President Pierce. We think 
Professor Ray attaches too great importance to 
the recollections of W. C. Price. Men who have 
outlived their influence habitually exaggerate 
their earlier exploits. James Madison Cutts, 
described as Douglas's " Boswell," was his 
father-in-law instead of his son-in-law. Pro- 
fessor Ray might have remarked that although 
Benton was defeated, his campaign for free 



territory saved Missouri to the Union during 
the Civil War. We dislike to criticize the 
typography of the book, but we cannot refrain 
from mentioning that the printing of notes at 
the foot of the final pages of the chapters, apart 
from the text and even without any related text, 
gives the volume a somewhat unsatisfactory 
appearance. j\ H. Hodder. 



Great Actors of the Eighteenth 
Century.* 



So painstaking a historian of the stage is Dr. 
Karl Mantzius, and so voluminous is his work, 
that one is loth to censure him upon the ground 
of incompleteness. Yet his " Great Actors of 
the Eighteenth Century," the fifth volume of 
his " History of Theatrical Art," is rendered 
incomplete by its failure to treat of the Italian 
actors of that epoch — the brightest in the history 
of the Italian stage. Biassed, it appears to be 
as well, in the amount of space devoted to German 
histrionism. Fully half of the volume treats of 
the actors and actresses of the latter country, 
two-thirds of the remainder being allotted to 
France, and one-third to England. 

Were Dr. Mantzius a German, this dispro- 
portion might be more comprehensible. Being 
a Dane, he has possibly been influenced unduly 
by his country's neighbors. An Anglo-Saxon is 
likely, however, to challenge the justice of devot- 
ing fifty-three pages to Schroder and fifty-five to 
Konrad Ekhof , while dismissing David Garrick 
with a paltry thirty-six. Lekain, too, is but 
casually mentioned ; and Talma, although he 
made his debut in 1787 and won renown in 
1789, is included among the great actors of the 
eighteenth century only by a remote mention. 

If, in his allotment of space, Dr. Mantzius 
appears biassed, his failure to recognize the 
Italian theatrical art of the eighteenth century 
is negligent, to say the least. True, the title of 
this volume is " Great Actors of the Eighteenth 
Century " — and in Italy, the theatrical art of 
that period is distinguished by dramaturgy rather 
than histrionism. Striking the death-knell of 
the commedia delVarte, in which the actor's 
ready wit supplied the dialogue and the leading 
characters were the conventional masks — Pan- 
taloon, Harlequin, Brighella, and the Doctor, — 
Goldoni gave Italy a realistic and national 
comedy; Alfieri, in his tragedies, sounded the

first true note of nationalism heard in the 
Peninsula since Dante's time. The scenario 
being then subordinated to the play, the actor to 
the dramatist — Dr. Mantzius, himself an actor, 
resents perhaps this dethronement of his craft ; 
yet, granting there were no Italian actors in the 
eighteenth century worthy to be dubbed great, 
it is nevertheless apparent that, until Goldoni 
sent young Collalto — trembling at his own 
transformation into a human being — unmasked 
and in plain clothes upon the stage of the 
S. Angelo Theatre at Venice to speak written 
lines, there had been no actors in Italy at all, 
if the actor be differentiated from the masked 
buffoon who for centuries had extemporized 
Italian comedy. If Antonio Sacchi, Cesare 
Darbes, and their colleagues, are small when 
compared with Garrick and Schroder, it is 
because of the smallness of the Italian tradition 
requiring the acting of human parts in masks 
and grotesque clothes; yet the very commedia 
dell arte, which is responsible for this stilted 
tenet, was the mine from which Moliere, and to 
a lesser degree Shakespeare, drew comic plots. 

In a previous volume Dr. Mantzius indicates 
the influence of the unwritten farces upon the 
comedy of other countries, yet dismisses Goldoni 
with a sentence. In the volume of which we 
are treating, the creator of the Italian realistic 
comedy, the man who first sent Italian buffoons 
upon the stage unmasked to speak written lines, 
is mentioned only as the author of plays, trans- 
lations of which were acted in Germany and 
France. 

In our author's defense, it is but just to quote 
from Mr. William Archer's Introduction to his 
voluminous work. " It will be observed," says 
the English critic, " that Dr. Mantzius does not 
profess to write a history of the Drama, but of 
' Theatrical Art.' In other words, he studies 
literary developments only in so far as they are 
affected by and, in their own turn, react upon 
the actual processes of representation." 

The Goldoni period in Italy is assuredly one 
in which a literary development affects the 
" actual process of representation." Dr. Mant- 
zius's failure to give it consideration is, to stig- 
matize it mildly, an oversight. Moreover, as 
a history of French and English acting in the 
eighteenth century, his volume is somewhat 
deficient. As an account of the German actors 
of the period — their lives and their art — it is, 
however, a valuable addition to dramatic litera- 
ture ; yet Lessing and Goethe and Schiller are 
slighted equally with Goldoni. 

Among dramatists, Voltaire, who played but 



an insignificant part in the theatrical history of 
his own country, alone is treated as a literary 
man whose work had " a lasting effect upon 
the actual process of the representation of 
plays." In this " History of Theatrical Art " 
during the century of Schiller, Goethe, Lessing, 
Goldsmith, Sheridan, Goldoni, Marivaux, Beau- 
marchais, and Alfieri, he is the sole dramatist 
whom Dr. Mantzius honors with a chapter. 
Apparently the only reason for giving him this 
undue prominence lies in the fact that he upheld 
the rights of actors as he did those of others he 
believed incapable of upholding their own, or 
possibly because he was publicly crowned at the 
Comedie-Francaise. 

" Voltaire, recois la couronne 
Que l'on vient de te presenter; 
II est beau de la me'riter 
Quand c'est la France qui la donne." 

France gave it. That is Voltaire's chief reason 
for meriting his dramatic laurel crown. The 
Frenchman's critical ability, however, is far 
keener than that of his Danish chronicler, for it 
was Voltaire who acclaimed Goldoni as " Painter 
and son of nature — the Italian Moliere ! " 

If the historical acumen of Dr. Mantzius is 
occasionally dimmed and his sense of proportion 
dwarfed by Germanic influence, he is never- 
theless a painstaking student who has made the 
history of his craft his life-work. In being a 
gatherer of valuable information rather than 
a historian lies his chief merit, there being a 
lack of order in his presentation of facts, which 
makes him at times difficult to follow. Still, his 
work is almost monumental ; indeed, it should 
find a place in the dramatic alcove of every 
library, for in no other single work has so much 
information concerning the stage been brought 
within reach of the student and thoroughly in- 
dexed. It is, however, a chronicle of actors and 
acting, rather than a history of theatrical art — 
a work in which one may trace the story of the 
various schools of acting, the development of 
the various forms of theatres, by reading assidu- 
ously between the lines. One seeking a knowl- 
edge of the history of the stage from both a 
dramatic and histrionic point of view will find 
Professor Brander Matthews's single volume on 
" The Development of the Drama " a clearer 
and safer guide than the five volumes from Dr. 
Mantzius's pen which have appeared in English 
translation. 

Of the latter, " Great Actors of the Eight- 
eenth Century " is perhaps the most entertain- 
ing, but the least analytical. It is a gossipy 
chronicle of the lives and doings of Carolina

More of the "Eternal Feminine."* 



If the reader of Mr. Reich's book on 
" Women through the Ages " is already famil- 
iar with the author's previous work in socio- 
logical and anthropological research, he will be 
prepared to find in this study of womanhood 
much valuable data and some philosophical 
acumen, together with scattered passages so 
extreme and iconoclastic, and representing 
views so distorted by prejudice, that they will 
arouse resentment and often justify ridicule. 
In his preface Mr. Reich disclaims any preten- 
sions to writing a history of Woman, but rather 
he has given " a number of more or less inter- 
esting notes on the condition and influence of 
women in a few centres of Western civilization." 
The query comes to us, Why should there be a 
separate history of Woman, since, as Mr. Reich 
asserts, she represents more than half of human- 
ity, and her influence must be included in all 
general histories of civilization? 

The two volumes consist, in large part, of 
collated notes upon the customs, dress, marital 
status and other conditions of women, from 
early Egyptian and Assyrian history down to 
the present aspects of social life in European 
countries and in America. The method in the 
earlier chapters is encyclopaedic, drawing from 
such standard sources as Erman, Rawlinson, 
Wilkinson, and Maspero's " Dawn of Civiliza- 
tion." The pictorial element is more marked 
in the treatment of Greek and Roman women. 
Greece has given to the world " eternal types"; 
its women furnished prototypes of many later 
characters, from the women of the Renaissance 

* Women through the Ages. By Emil Reich. In 
two volumes. Illustrated in photogravure, etc. New York : 
E. P. Dutton & Co. 



and the chatelaine of the Middle Ages to the 
Feminist of modern times. The author con- 
trasts^the noble women of early Greece, in the 
days of small kingdoms, with their successors 
under Imperialism. Here he gives the first 
note of challenge, which is sounded with loud 
assurance in the last chapters of the second 
volume : "Just as Imperialism in modern times 
has, in its excessive form, produced the domi- 
nating, almost masculine, women of America 
and Russia, and in its milder manifestation the 
retiring and somewhat lifeless English woman, 
so in. ancient Greece this same force occasioned 
the unrestricted freedom and undisputed ascend- 
ancy of the Spartans as opposed to the rigid 
exclusiveness and dependent inferiority of the 
Athenian woman." 

The book relates many stories, both authentic 
and apocryphal, of Roman matrons. A few 
heroines — Cornelia, Aurelia, and others — are 
chosen for types of women whose learning 
was tempered by devotion to their family and 
country, in contrast with the later degenerates 
with a compulsive desire for excitement and 
notoriety. The essay on Roman life is admir- 
able in condensation and effectiveness. After 
two or three dull chapters on mediaeval women 
in palaces, harems, and convents, there fol- 
lows a fine pen-portrait of Joan of Arc. Mr. 
Reich writes fervently — as does Mr. Andrew 
Lang in his "Maid of France" — of the 
patriotic zeal, the spirituality and magnetic 
courage, .which impelled this mystic maiden to 
become the deliverer of France in a crucial 
period. The tendency toward idealism in the 
study of Joan of Arc is in contrast with the 
stern, unsparing censure of Isabella of Spain, 
" a fanatical agent of priest and monk." Mr. 
Reich is not the first historian to shatter the 
pretty picture of Isabella pledging her jewels to 
Columbus, and to substitute the vision of her 
cruelty to Jews and Moslems. 

Women of England and France are con- 
sidered chronologically from the periods of the 
Tudors and Stuarts to the French Revolution 
and the Empire. " A queen often typifies the 
women of her country and time " is an axiomatic 
statement which precedes special emphasis upon 
the traits and influence of Elizabeth, Mary 
Stuart, Queen Anne, and Marie Antoinette. 
There are no new interpretations of character, 
but the phrasing is sometimes terse and force- 
ful, as thus : " Marie Antoinette was wilful, 
capricious, and captivating, with enough unrea- 
sonableness to ruin any monarchy." With a 
striking sentence of amusing simile, Mr. Reich

diverts attention from the amorous, intriguing 
women of the French court, and the brilliant 
hostesses of the salons : ** To turn to the 
English woman of the eighteenth century, after 
contemplating her French sister of the same 
period, is like eating a penny bun after enjoy- 
ing a delicate eclair." The repressive influ- 
ences of England made the women insular and 
dull, with a few exceptions like the Duchess 
of Marlborough, Lady Montagu, and Fanny 
Burney. 

" Literary Women of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury " are treated briefly, and very inadequately, 
in a single chapter. Jane Austen and the 
Brontes meet with approbation ; but it is a cause 
of amazement to the author that George Eliot 
" should have acquired such a reputation in 
England, one so infinitely surpassing that of 
her infinitely more gifted husband. . . . She 
developed the German dry-as-dust system in 
relation to English fiction ; she provided a tin- 
selly, besmudged perversion which she induced 
the fiction-reading public credulously to regard 
as a mediaeval Florentine romance." To Mr. 
Lewes should be accredited all the inspiration 
of George Eliot's best work, says Mr. Reich ; 
* l the feeble didacticism and verbosity are her 
own." George Sand is treated yet more cava- 
lierly, as " an unworthy vampire, who sucked 
the vitality out of at least two great men — 
Alfred de Musset and Frederick Chopin." 

The limits of his space, the breadth of his 
theme, and his personal sympathies have visibly 
restricted and hampered Mr. Reich. There is 
no effort to consider, except incidentally, the 
many women of later centuries who have won 
honor in art, music, science, or on the stage. 
However difficult it must have been for him to 
" pour gallons into a pint measure," he has 
placed few restrictions on his space — or on his 
animus — in the last two chapters of the work, 
" Feminism of the Nineteenth Century " and 
•• Women in America," in which he pronounces 
anathemas against the " bold, assertive, ' defem- 
inized ' woman of modern life, who is clamor- 
ing and scheming for ' emancipation.' " Quite 
apart from the question of suffrage, there is gen- 
eral recognition of the fact that under present 
political conditions women can forward many 
reform movements of much value to society. 
Mr. Reich, however, holds very positive views 
on the usefulness — or, rather, the uselessness — 
of such efforts toward moral betterment. " It 
is in the West," he says, M that the only move- 
ment comes, a movement — at its mistaken 
best — which makes a crusade against prostitu- 



tion, alcoholism, and war; all of which must 
exist as hideous necessities, and which, if they 
could be swept away, would in their disappear- 
ance utterly upset the balance of civilization." 
There are many besides women who will dissent 
emphatically from this unjust disparagement. 

In his book " Success among Nations," pub- 
lished five years ago, Mr. Reich devoted his final 
chapter to expressing his convictions regarding 
the inferiorities of America in general, and 
especially of the " hyper-educated " dashing 
American woman. For five unbroken years, he 
tells us, he lived among us ; but he surely was 
unable to arrive at broad and just interpretations 
of our social conditions. In this later work he 
says that he has "been treated to wall-shaking 
criticism on account of ignorance and wilful mis- 
representation," but he insists upon expanding 
and emphasizing many of his earlier strictures. 
American women seem to him distinct from the 
genus as found elsewhere, as " unwomaned," 
" Amazonian," without spontaneity or elemental 
talent, and with " sensational " and unreasoned 
energy. In previous essays, as well as in the 
present book, he has discovered an antagonism, 
k ' a latent contempt," heaped by American 
women upon the men, who are represented as 
" male Cinderellas " and " mere lamplighters 
in the orchestra of life in the United States." 
With a vehement " Horribile dictu!" the 
author asserts that the climax of vices in the 
American woman is her prevailing " humour- 
ousness " at the expense of her " enamel and 
morning-dew." This " humorousness " will find 
free scope for its exercise in reading critically 
Mr. Reich's chapters on American women of 
to-day. Many of the passages are so perverse 
that they cannot be taken seriously. Mr. Reich 
has seen and faithfully portrayed certain kinds 
of women in American life, of both higher and 
lower social strata ; but he has no warrant for 
generalizing their deplorable qualities as na- 
tional traits. We will quote a paragraph from 
what he has to say on this subject. 

" I am quite aware of the fact that hundreds of thou- 
sands of American women are hard-worked house- 
keepers and mothers and wives. All these hundreds 
of thousands of American women, de facto devoted to 
nothing but to the cares of their homes, do not in the 
least invalidate my thesis. While the mere external or 
material fact of their hard work inside their homes is 
undeniable, yet they too are potentially as hostile and 
indifferent to their homes, husbands, and maternity, as 
are such of the American women whom here I take to 
be the type of American womanhood. I mean this : 
whenever a woman of the States does devote her prin- 
cipal attention and labour to her home, she does so be- 
cause, owing to the insufficient income of her husband, 



126 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



she is absolutely compelled to do so. But let that hard- 
working and apparently home-loving American woman 
learn of a substantial increase in her husband's income, 
and all her potentialities will at once step out into con- 
crete reality, and she will become, from one day to 
another, nothing but a pleasure-ridden and sensation- 
ridden frequenter of all bazaars, lectures, operas, exhi- 
bitions, ' crazes,' and an eager purchaser of the ' latest ' 
costumes, jewellery, books, and furniture. The French 
bourgeoise will, in nineteen out of twenty cases of such 
a sudden improvement in her husband's income, alter 
not an iota in the manner or method of her life; in her 
the potentialities of the • shining stunner ' and sensa- 
tionalist are very feeble indeed. In every woman in 
America they are stronger than any other propensity. 
This is why I am disinclined to admit any real exceptions 
with regard to the type of womanhood in America." 
(Vol. II., p. 260.) 

The value of Mr. Reich's work is marred by 
passages like this, which reveal narrowness of 
view and prejudice ; otherwise it would be an 
authoritative contribution to sociology. No 
distinct chapter is given to German women, yet 
the author by incidental references shows favor- 
itism toward them, as typifying his model of 
womanhood. In comparing the prediction of 
the Goncourts' Journal, regarding the inspira- 
tion of American women, with their failures, he 
says : " The same Goncourts, in the same part 
of their invaluable Journal, speak of the Alle- 
mande or the German woman as one who can 
and does rouse in man the more ideal senti- 
ments. Well, it is Germany and not America 
that has, in the last thirty years, made the most 
remarkable conquests . ' '

a naval war Toward the close of the eighteenth 
that was not century, hostilities occurred between 
declared. t h e nav i es f the United States and 

France, and some sharp engagements took place at 
sea, although war between the two countries was not 
actually declared. The story of this exciting epi- 
sode in our national history has been well told by 
Dr. Gardner W. Allen, in a volume entitled " Our 
Naval War with France " (Houghton Mifflin Co.). 
This book, with the author's previous volume on 
" Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs," published 
a few years ago, relate the history of the American 
navy from 1785, when the last national vessel of the 
Revolution was sold, to 1812, the beginning of the 
period of greatest naval brilliancy. These years 
had been previously covered, of course, by such 
standard histories as those of Spears and Maclay ; 



but they had not devoted much space to this some- 
what neglected era, and Dr. Allen has written the 
first complete account of our conflicts with France 
and Barbary. The initial chapters of the more 
recent volume, on our war with France, are entitled 
" Early Misunderstandings," " Negotiations," and 
" French Spoliations," and treat of the causes that 
led to the actual hostilities. The five following 
chapters, "Naval Preparation," "The Opening of 
Hostilities," " Events of 1799," " The Last Year of 
the War," and " Private Armed Vessels," deal with 
the establishment of the navy and the naval and 
privateering operations of the war. The four con- 
cluding chapters, entitled " The Convention of 
1800," " Reduction of the Navy," " Spoliations after 
1801," and "The Spoliation Claims," are mainly 
concerned with events growing out of the war. In 
the appendix there is a list of the sources of informa- 
tion used by the author, some extracts from treaties 
and decrees for the years 1778-1807, lists of vessels 
and officers in service in 1798-1801, and a note on 
the nautical day. Two fine French prints, repre- 
senting the engagement between the " Constella- 
tion " and the " Insurgente," which appeared in 
1799, are now republished — it is believed, for the 
first time. The book is written in a simple and 
direct style, and presents a clear and readable 
account of the stirring events described.

can historian, Professor R. M. Johnston of Harvard, 
whose Short History of the Revolution is issued by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The book presents a 
brief statement of a few chief events, with more 
extended discussion of their causes and significance. 
The introductory chapter, entitled " Perspective," 
is a rapid review of the work of preceding historians 
who dealt with the same events, from Madame 
de Stael to the microscopic specialists of the twen- 
tieth century ; with the conclusion that the earlier 
writers distorted the facts, while our contemporaries 
are inclined "to establish beyond question the pre- 
cise shade of the colour of Robespierre's breeches, 
but to give up as unattainable having any opinion 
on the French Revolution as a whole." Then fol- 
lows a simple, readable, and thoughtfully discussed 
narrative, that is not so radically different from other 
succinct histories of the period as the critical preface 
might lead one to expect. The volume ends with a 
chapter headed " Art and Literature," containing 
Fabre d'Eglantine's explanation of the months of 
the Revolutionary Calendar, with their correspond- 
ence to the months as we have them ; as well as 
several poems of the period, principally from the 
pen of Andre" Ohenier. In view of the fact that the 
results of the upheaval are still variously estimated, — 
certain distinguished students even failing to find 
decided permanent results, — it is worth while 
quoting Professor Johnston's opinion in the matter. 
" The gradual political education and coming to

power of the masses," he says (page 9), "is a 
process that is the logical outcome of the Revolution ; 
and the joining of hands of a wing of the intellect- 
uals with the most radical section of the working- 
men is a sign of the times not to be passed over. 
From Voltaire before the Revolution, to Anatole 
France at the present day, the tradition and devel- 
opment is continuous and logical."

Home of the Soul " (Funk & Wag-

many appreciators of the author of "The Simple

name from the church where the author preaches in 
Paris, Le Foyer de I'Arne, where from Sunday to 
Sunday there gathers a remarkably cosmopolitan 
congregation, in which may be found Jews, Roman 
Catholics, and free-thinkers. The volume is the 
first literary product of Pastor Wagner's ministry in 
his new church home. The fifteen discourses here 
printed are filled with the spirit of that simple, 
earnest, humane piety which has given the preacher 
a unique place in the modern world. They do not 
discuss the ancient dogmas, although some of them 
are mildly implied. There is no effort made to 
reconstruct theology, but rather to enrich and de- 
velope human life. The aim is not to set forth the 
religious values of science, or to plead a socialistic 
programme. The purpose at work here goes deep : 
to reach the heart and arouse an earnest desire for 
the spiritual life. But the spiritual life thus advo- 
cated is mainly humanitarian and profoundly ethi- 
cal. The book opens with a characteristic sketch 
and estimate of Pastor Wagner, full of warmest 
praise eloquently expressed, by the Rev. Dr. Lyman 
Abbott. It contains four attractive illustrations, two 
of Mr. Wagner and two of his church.

Mr. Dickinson's title does not involve any funda- 
mental treatment of the primary difficulty as to 
whether the soul is immortal or no ; and the lecturer 
contented himself with a delightfully written expan-

of the address : " But what I do maintain is that 
life would have indefinitely more value if we knew 
that beyond death we should pursue, and ultimately 
to a successful issue, the elusive ideal of which we

graceful presentation ; but we miss one feature that 
is so attractively present in most of his other writ- 
ings. For in the present instance he has neglected 
his adherence to the sublime Platonic tenet that we 
must follow unhesitatingly whithersoever the argu- 



ment may lead. It is still Mr. Dickinson that is 
speaking — not Mr. Dickinson with some slight 
limitations, whether imposed by himself or the oc-

The veteran dramatic critic, Mr. William Winter, has 
prepared an elaborate work on " The Life and Art of 
Richard Mansfield," which will be issued this fall. 

After numerous delays, it now seems probable that 
Mr. William De Morgan's new novel, " It Never Can 
Happen Again," will appear during the present month. 

A volume of essays by Sir Alfred Austin, bearing 
the title "The Bridling of Pegasus; or, Prose Papers 
on Poetry," will be issued this year by the Macmillan 
Company. 

The interesting " Home Letters " of General Sher- 
man, which have been a feature of " Scribner's Mag- 
azine " during the past few months, are soon to appear 
in book form. 

" My Lady of the North," Mr. Randall Parrish's pop- 
ular novel of a few years ago, is to be followed this fall 
by another story by the same writer, to be called " My 
Lady of the South." 

" The Foreigner," Ralph Connor's forthcoming novel, 
will have Saskatchewan for its scene, and for its char- 
acters various types of the foreign population of the 
Canadian Northwest. 

Mr. Maurice Hewlett has written a new novel, soon 
to be published, dealing with the early life of that lov- 
able tramp-artist-philosopher, Senhouse, who figured so 
prominently in " Halfway House." 

"The Forms of Discourse," by Professor W. B. 
Cairns, is published in a revised edition by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. The changes made are many, but not radical, 
and the book is better than ever adapted to its purpose. 

"Teaching Children to Study," by Miss Lida B. 
Earhart, is a useful little book, the outcome of much 
experience and observation. It appears in the " River- 
side Educational Monographs " of Houghton Mifflin Co. 

" Cyrus Hall McCormick and the Reaper," by Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites, is published by the State His- 
torical Society of Wisconsin in commemoration of the 
centenary of the inventor's birth — for he also was of 
the great year 1809. 

" Something of Men I Have Known " is the title of 
the volume of reminiscences by the Hon. Adlai E. 
Stevenson, Vice-President under Grover Cleveland, and 
a prominent figure in national politics, soon to be pub- 
lished by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

Mrs. Lecky has written a memoir of her husband, 
the late Right Honorable W. E. H. Lecky, and Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. hope to publish it in the 
autumn. The volume will contain many interesting 
letters, and will be illustrated by several portraits. 

Mr. Robert Hichens's latest novel, which will be 
issued in September or early October, will be called 
" The Knock on the Door." It is said that in the new 
story the author has returned to the scene and the 
manner of his earlier and best book, " The Garden of 
Allah." 

One of the most important of forthcoming books is 
Dr. Sven Hedin's record of adventure in the bleak wil- 
derness of Tibet. "Trans-Himalaya: Discoveries and 



Adventures in Tibet " is the full title of this book, in 
which Dr. Hedin tells, with the aid of many photo- 
graphs and sketches brought home by himself, of his 
successful effort to force his way into the forbidden 
city of Lhassa. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. will publish very soon 
"Hellas and Hesperia; or, The Vitality of Greek 
Studies in America," three lectures by Basil Lanneau 
Gildersleeve, Francis White Professor of Greek in the 
Johns Hopkins University and formerly Professor in the 
University of Virginia. 

"The Reader's Library," edited by Messrs. W. J. 
and C. W. Dawson, an enterprise hitherto in the hands 
of the Fleming H. Revell Co., has been transferred to 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers, who now reissue the two 
volumes of " The Great English Letter- Writers," upon 
which we made favorable comment last year. 

" The Pageant of English Poetry " is to be published 
immediately by Mr. Henry Frowde. It is a collection 
of 1150 poems and extracts from poetical works, written 
by upwards of 300 poets from the earliest to the present 
times. The poets appear in alphabetical order, and 
great pains have been taken to ensure accuracy in the 
texts. 

The warfare against tuberculosis has been succinctly 
described in a new book soon to be published by Messrs. 
Thomas Y. Crowell & Company — "The Great White 
Plague," by Dr. Edward 0. Otis. The work is de- 
scribed as popular in treatment and designed to aid every 
reader with practical hints as to eating, sleeping, and 
breathing. 

Part I. of "A Text-Book of Psychology," by Pro- 
fessor Edward Bradford Titchener, is published by the 
Macmillan Co. It is a substitute for, and enlargement 
of, the author's " Outlines of Psychology," dated 1896. 
The latter work will, however, be kept upon the market 
until its successor is completed by the publication of a 
Second Part. 

A new volume of " Collections of the Illinois State 
Historical Library " gives us a series of " Governors' 
Letter-Books " from 1818 to 1834, covering the terms 
of Bond, Coles, Edwards, and Reynolds. Portraits of 
all four executives are given. The volume is edited by 
Messrs. Evarts Boutwell Greene and Clarence Wal- 
worth Atwood. 

Notwithstanding Meredith's declaration that he would 
" most horribly haunt " the man who should publish a 
memoir of him, such a work has been undertaken by 
Mr. Edward Clodd, and will appear in the course of a 
year. An authorized collection of Meredith's letters is 
now being prepared for publication by the competent 
hands of Lord Morley. 

"India: Impressions and Suggestions" is the title 
of a book by Mr. J. Keir Hardie, M.P., to be published 
immediately by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. Mr. Hardie is 
well known as the leader of the Labor Party in Par- 
liament. He spent two months in India studying 
social, political, and economic conditions, and writes 
frankly and freely of what he saw. 

The autumn fiction list of Messrs. Little, Brown, & 
Co. includes a new " Aunt Jane " book by Mrs. Eliza 
Calvert Hall, entitled "The Land of Long Ago"; a 
romance by Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin, " Veronica 
Playfair"; Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson's "The Castle 
by the Sea "; a collection of stories by " Anne Warner," 
entitled " Your Child and Mine "; and a story by Mr. 
Halliwell Sutcliffe, " Priscilla of the Good Intent."

The Southern Star (Atlanta, Ga.) lays: " The object of this book is to 
set the reader to thinking, and to set him to thinking the author has 
asked such questions as ' What is Truth ? ' ' What is Man's mission on 
earth ? ' ' What did he come for in the world ? ' It is not filled with 
dry, uninteresting matter, but is chuck full of common sense and 
straight from the shoulder blows against the conditions prevailing."

and the Egyptian setting is one peculiarly suited to Mr. Hichens' extraordinary talent. It is a 
powerful drama — a contest between materialism and idealism, between a man who loves the soul 
and a woman who adores the body.

RETROSPECTIONS 
OF AN ACTIVE LIFE 



BY 

JOHN BIGELOW 

This important work is now ready. It covers a period of over fifty 

years' activity on the part of its distinguished author, and relates his 

experiences as editor and part proprietor of the New York Evening Post, 

as Consul and Minister to France, where, during the critical period of our 

Civil War, his skill and devotion rendered a service of the highest value 

to the Republic. John Bigelow has enjoyed the privilege of friendship 

with most of the prominent personages of the Victorian era in England 

and France as well as in his own country, and the correspondence which 

the volumes contain gives the work a wide range of personal interest. Its chief value will lie in the new 

light it brings to bear on vexed questions of history, and it can be safely said no future history of the 

period covered can be written without a considerable dependence on its authority. 

The work has been set up, printed, and bound by the DeVinne Press. 
Forty-eight illustrations. Three volumes. Quarto, boxed. Net $12.00 ; carriage extra.

THE 
WISTFUL YEARS 

By ROY ROLFE GILSON 

Author of " Katrina " and "In the

This hook is an exquisite idyl of 
young love, fresh and glowing. Con- 
ceived in a poetic spirit, mellowed 
by the quaintest humor, and digni- 
fied by touches of real pathos, it is 
the kind of book that will be read, 
and read again, by those who love 
to view their youth in pensive retro- 
spection. The book pulses with the 
pure joy of living, and David and 
Margaret are certain to attain a 
proud eminence in the affections of 
the readers.

Parenthood and Race Culture

This book constitutes the first attempt

assumes that there is no wealth but life, 
that the culture of the racial life is the 
vital industry of any people, that conditions 
of parenthood, and especially as regards its 
quality rather than its quantity, are the 
dominant factors that determine the des-

MARRIAGE AS 



A TRADE 



By CICELY HAMILTON 

An able and most timely discussion of a subject very 
much before the public eye just now — except that Miss 
Hamilton's guns are not trained upon the ballot-box. It 
is, above all things, an argument for the woman who 
chooses some other career than marriage ; but it also 
warmly and ably advocates a view of marriage which 
would make it a real partnership, not merely a partner- 
ship iu social and parental affairs.

Dashing headlong to a triumphant conclusion, this new Beach novel — from the first page 
to the last — has all the sheer power of "The Spoilers" and all the racy humor and sympathy 
of "The Barrier." A background, superb in its silvery romance, is the life-story of the salmon 
— and over it the ominous hand of the fisheries magnates. The hero is a young civil-engineer, 
in love with the daughter of a financier. In search of a fortune sufficient to meet the views of 
her father, he has spent years of hardship in Alaska. When he has almost given up hope, he 
meets Cherry Malotte — the Cherry of "The Spoilers" — all fire and grit and tenderness, and 
the two join forces. Illustrated. Pictorial Cover in Colors. $1.50

THE REDEMPTION OF 
KENNETH GALT 

By WILL N. HARBEN 

The scene is — -as it should be — the rural 
Georgia Mr. Harben has made famous. In 
this new novel the author goes still deeper 
into the field of passionate realism. Kenneth 
Gait is brilliant, able, with a theory of fife 
which pretty much allows human beings to 
make their own moral laws. The uncon- 
scious power of the novel as a plea for lawful 
living makes the book a very strong one.

Here is something new in the way of a story. There is no striving after great effects, but the tale is as 
sweet as the first dreams of young love, as simple as the unconscious caress of a little child; and one believes 
in it as one believes in the affection of his mother. It has to do with the ordinary people of everyday life — 
the people Lincoln said God must have loved because He made so many of them — and the fun they got out 
of life — fun spiced with little troubles — is all worth while. Illustrated. Cloth, $1.00

The Watchers of the Plains The Lonely Guard 



A Tale of the Western Plains. By Ridgwell 

Cullum. Frontispiece in color by J. C. Leyen- 
decker. Large i2mo. Cloth. $1.50 

This story of Dakota in the 70's. depicting one of the Indian 
uprisings that were so frequent and so terrible in those early 
years, is of more than ordinary interest. Rosebud, the hero- 
ine of the tale, has been stolen as a child by the Indians of the 
Rosebud Reservation, from whom she is rescued while still a 
mere child by the strong and manly Seth, a character no one 
can fail to admire. It would spoil the story to tell how a 
beautiful love gradually develops between the girl and her 
rescuer, and how she finally risks her life to save those who 
are dear to her.

An intensely interesting story, the scene laid in Austria and 
one of the smaller German principalities a century and a half 
ago. The " Lonely Guard " is an Austrian captain sent to 
guard a castle in the mountain fastnesses of Germany, where 
two high-spirited girls of rank and breeding are virtually held 
as prisoners by the Austrian government. The tale is full 
of adventure and novel experiences, the situations in which 
the captain sometimes finds himself being unusual in the 
extreme.

A delightful blending of description, history, and narrative, 
giving in fullest sense the " local color " of the Imperial City, 
that great centre of art, religion, and history. Mr. Potter has 
done full justice to his very difficult subject, and it is doubtful 
if a better account of modern Rome, revealing in it also the 
ancient and mediaeval city, can be found. Mr. Markino, the 
artist, has brought to his task that keen perception of con- 
trasts and that trained eye for color that are peculiar to the 
oriental.

With such a wealth of material pertaining to the violet, it 

seems strange that no one has heretofore collected it in an 

appropriate volume. It is surely one of the most popular 

flowers to be found in any country, and for centuries poets have 

apostrophized to it and sung its praises. Some of the poets 

represented in this collection are : J. G. Whittier, O. W.

Professor Podmore believes that some of the remarkable cures that have been effected through Christian Science

consciously or unconsciously used in Christian Science healing.

Each study is a gem in itself, showing strong character analysis 
and a deep love of romance. So varied are the types, nationali-

interest, and the essential monotony of love stories — for the 
majority have to do with love — is lost in

MARIE OF ARCADY Ready October 1 6

The scene of this story of to-day is a settlement in the basin of a bayou along the lower Mississippi, remote from the world 
and from the century. Here dwell the 'Cajan people, who are the descendants of the exiles of the Evangeline legend. The story in 
its sweetness and human appeal is filled with the idyllic charm of its setting, but it is not without its dramatic quality, and this is 
all the more powerful because it is unsuspected by the reader. 

The lovable characters are admirably drawn and give a clearly defined picture of a people and a locality which become the 
author's own as surely as Mary E. Wilkins stands for New England rural life, and George W. Cable for old Creole days in New Orleans. 

The story with its quaintness contains many a smile and produces many a lump in the throat, and it leaves the reader with 
that " Dickensy " feeling we all love so well of " God bless us every one."

To Reach Book Buyers 

It is necessary to reach the intelligent minority 
in every community — the people interested in 
books. The best advertising medium for this pur- 
pose is a family newspaper so well edited that it 
attracts this minority over a vast and prosperous 
region, especially if it keeps its readers informed 
daily on the news of the book world. Publishers 
have found that the 

Best Medium in the West 

Is the Chicago Record- Herald— the only Chicago 
morning paper that prints book news and reviews 
every day the year around — because it goes into 
the homes of book-reading men and women. Its 
literary judgments command respect throughout 
the country. The average net sold circulation for 
1908 exceeded 141,000 copies daily and 197,000 
copies Sunday. 

This vast body of book readers in Chicago and 
the Middle West can be reached only through the

The New New York 

By JOHN C. VAN DYKE; illustrated by JOSEPH PENNELL 

The most attractive book yet written about the ever-changing city. Few realize the significance of

it has achieved, and as a suggestion of what may be looked for in the future of this still growing city.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... 188 

(A classified list of the new books to appear during 

the coming Fall and Winter season.) 



BOOKS OF T HE CO MING YEAH. 

Perhaps the most notable characteristic of 
our full classified list of publishers' announce- 
ments of new books, published elsewhere in this 
issue, is afforded by the great variety and 
interest of the biographical category. A good 
biography of an important person is the most 
satisfactory kind of a book. It may have all 
the interest of the best type of fiction, with the 
added interest that comes from our conscious- 
ness that it is the portrayal of a real rather 
than of an imagined life. Readers of the next 
few months may revel in this form of literary 
enjoyment, since all tastes seem to have been 
provided for. From Boccaccio to G. B. Shaw, 
from Joan of Arc to John Bigelow, the chrono- 
logical gamut is run ; the frivolous are remem- 
bered with gossippy memoirs, the sober with 
lives of statesmen and actors and men of af- 
fairs and men of letters. 

One could not go far astray in searching 
among these forthcoming biographies for " the 
book of the year," and in fixing upon the 
" Retrospections of an Active Life," by Mr. 
John Bigelow. This wonderful old man, now 
completing his ninety-second year, with an 
intellect whose keenness is no whit dulled by 
age, has told his life-story, with reflections upon 
a historical period quorum pars magna fv it. 
in three volumes that cannot fail to be of ab- 
sorbing interest to all American readers. It does 
not seem likely that any other publication of 
the year can have quite so strong a claim upon 
our attention. For a fair second, we may men- 
tion Mr. William Winter's " Life and Art of 
Richard Mansfield," which we trust may be far 
from the last work of its veteran author, now 
freed from the bondage of ignoble journalism. 
Long may he continue to praise whatever is 
of good report in the drama, and to castigate 
the stage corrupters of public morals! Among 
biographies of famous Englishmen we are to 
expect one of Stanley written by himself, of 
Sheridan by Mr. Walter Sichel, of Lecky by 
his widow, of Richard Jefferies by Mr. Edward 
Thomas, and of Lord Kelvin by Mr. Silvanus 
P. Thompson. Among Americans, there will be 
a Grover Cleveland by Mr. George F. Parker, 
a Stephen A. Douglas by Mr. Clark E. Carr, 
and a J. D. Whitney by Mr. Edwin T. Brewster. 
A life of Bach by Sir Hubert Parry, and one 



170 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



of Verlaine by M. E. Lepelletier, may be given 
as a continental makeweight to these English 
and American examples. 

Among works of history, the following seem 
to us particularly alluring : " The Birth of 
Modern Italy," a volume of papers by the late 
Jessie White Mario ; " Garibaldi and the 
Thousand," by Mr. George M. Trevelyan ; 
" Men and Manners of Old Florence," by Dr. 
Guido Biagi ; " The Great French Revolution," 
by Prince Peter Kropotkin ; " Society and 
Politics in Ancient Rome," by Professor Frank 
F. Abbott ; and " The Foundations of the 
Nineteenth Century " (which will probably turn 
out to be political and social philosophy rather 
than history), by Mr. Houston Stewart Cham- 
berlain, that distinguished English scholar who 
writes his books in German, to be afterwards 
translated into his own tongue. 

In the field of literature, the publication of 
Emerson's Journals seems to be the most im- 
portant single announcement. They are to be 
edited by Messrs. Edward W. Emerson and 
Waldo Emerson Forbes, and will be precious 
documents indeed. Volumes of essays that will 
find eager readers are " The American of the 
Future," by Professor Brander Matthews ; 
" American Prose Masters," by Mr. William 
C. Brownell ; " The Mystery of Education, and 
Other Academic Performances," by Professor 
Barrett Wendell ; " The Spirit of America," 
by Mr. Henry van Dyke ; " Essays on Modern 
Novelists," by Professor William L. Phelps ; 
"Masters of the English Novel," by Professor 
Richard Burton ; and collections of papers by 
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson and 
Richard Watson Gilder. Two important works 
of cognate interest are Professor Gildersleeve's 
" Hellas and Hesperia," being lectures on the 
vitality of Greek studies in America, and Pro- 
fessor Mahaffy's " What Have the Greeks Done 
for Civilization ? " being a Lowell lecture course 
of last winter. 

The poet usually avoids the puff preliminary, 
and it is our experience every year that the 
most vital poetry comes almost unheralded. 
The announcements at hand, however, include 
volumes by Mr. Percy Mackaye, Dr. Henry 
van Dyke, Mr. Charles E. Russell, Mr. Richard 
Le Gallienne, Professor Richard Burton, Mr. 
Madison Cawein, Miss Louise Imogen Guiney, 
Miss Josephine Preston Peabody, and Mrs. 
Florence Earle Coates. We are glad to note 
that " Dido, Queen of Carthage," by Mr. 
Stephen Phillips, is promised for early publi- 
cation, and that the poems of Mr. William 



Winter are to be brought into a newly col- 
lected edition. 

In the wilderness of promised fiction there is 
one cheerful resting-place provided by Mr. De 
Morgans new story, characteristically entitled 
" It Never Can Happen Again." We are not 
likely to have another novel " equally as good," 
although we make the suggestion with a certain 
hesitation, being fresh from the late summer 
surprise of " The Old Wives' Tale," and re- 
calling two or three other recent delightful 
examples of the unexpected. We may also 
entertain "great expectations" of such books 
as " Ann Veronica," by Mr. H. G. Wells ; 
" Open Country," by Mr. Maurice Hewlett ; 
" A Life for a Life," by Mr. Robert Herrick ; 
" John Marvel, Assistant," by Mr. Thomas 
Nelson Page ; and " Bella Donna," by Mr. 
Robert Hichens. If we may not expect greatly, 
we at least know about what we shall get in 
such stories as " The Silver Horde," by Mr. 
Rex Beach ; " The Leopai'd and the Lady," 
by Miss Marjorie Bowen ; " The Danger Mark," 
by Mr. Robert W. Chambers ; " The Florentine 
Frame," by Miss Elizabeth Robins ; and " The 
Red Saint," by Mr. Warwick Deeping. We 
are also to have " Stradella," a second posthu- 
mous book by Marion Crawford ; and also " On 
the Lightship," a posthumous collection of stories 
by Herman Knickerbocker Viele. There are 
others, to the number of several hundreds ; and 
we shall see what we shall see. 

Perhaps, after all, books of travel will occupy 
the foremost place in the public eye. What 
volumes may be brought forth by Messrs. Cook 
and Peary and their zealous partisans we may 
hardly conjecture ; but of books actually in sight 
we note Mr. Sven Hedin's " Trans-Himalaya," 
and "An Antarctic Voyage" by Lieutenant 
Shackleton, both of which will be contributions 
to knowledge if not to entertainment. And the 
reader for pleasure combined with instruction 
will be likely to find his account in such books 
as that on Portugal by Mr. Ernest Oldmeadow, 
" Seven English Cities " by Mr. W. D. Howells, 
" Unknown Tuscany " by Mr. Edward Hutton, 
" The Land of the Lion " by Mr. W. S. Rains- 
ford, and Mr. Albert Sonnichsen s " Confessions 
of a Macedonian Bandit." The travels of John 
Davis in the United States a hundred years ago 
are to be reprinted, offering a contrast to books 
of modern journeyings. And if there is any- 
thing in an author's name to attract attention 
to a book, readers should be found for a work on 
" The Servian People " by Prince Lazarovich- 
Hrebeli'ainovich.

THE BOOKS FR OM Q UEER STREET. 

There is an indefinable something about the books 
from Queer Street that always betrays them. Just 
as the mentally unbalanced reveal their unsteadiness 
of equilibrium by their gait, their gestures, a turn 
of the head, a glance of the eye, so the writings of 
the eccentric, the obsessed, the more or less insane, 
have a tone or a style or an atmosphere that unfail- 
ingly distinguishes them from the books from Ortho- 
dox Avenue. 

The favorite topics of our eccentric authors, our 
writers born with a screw loose somewhere in the 
brain's mechanism, are the famous insoluble prob- 
lems of all ages, such as the squaring of the circle, 
the doubling of the cube, the trisecting of an angle, 
the invention of perpetual motion, the finding of the 
philosopher's stone, and so on ; while also the upset- 
ting of accepted theories, like the law of gravitation 
or the sphericity of the globe, is undertaken again 
and again with a zeal truly religious. A first cousin 
to the passion for humbling Newton to the dust is 
the frantic eagerness to strip Shakespeare of his 
honors. In recent years still another class of peculiar 
books has made its appearance — the products, or 
by-products, of the H new psychology," the works of 
writers indulging in somewhat too beatific visions of 
the unlimited powers and possibilities of the human 
mind. 

To touch briefly on the last class first, its authors 
affect a vagueness of expression, a floridity of style, 
and a free use of neologisms, that rarely fail to 
impress and overawe the reader of unscholarly habit 
and inexact thinking. In a recent work that pro- 
fesses to be "a relation of the observations and 
experiences of a philosopher and poet in the spirit 
world," communicated by thought-vibrations to an 
earthly scribe, there is much said about harmonial 
relations with the infinite, spiritual radiations, aural 
surroundings, incarnate and excarnate souls, vice- 
gerents of the Great Oversold, and other like sub- 
limities. Amid much that is excellent and suggestive 
in its way, a few characteristic sentences, a little 
baffling to the plain reader, may be quoted as rhetor- 
ical examples. u The polarization of all spiritual 
aspirations in consciousness precedes illumination 
and the unfolding of the theocracy." " Why should 
I not sit at the feet of wisdom, and learn from the 
vice-gerents of the Great Oversold, whose radiations 
permeate every part of an infinite universe, in whose 
effluences these, my desired teachers, had become 
partakers of that whereof I had not attained ? " The 
writer more than once struggles unsuccessfully with 
the difficulties of u attain " and " obtain," and what 
preposition, if any. to use with each ; he attains of 
and obtains to, which is sad to the grammarian. He 
also splits his infinitives with a ruthlessness that 
would sorely disturb the serenity of a purist, and 
ordinary words are shouldered out of the way to give 
place to terms not yet vulgarized by any maker of 
dictionaries. Somewhat as the ancient Greeks dis- 
guised the terrors of the furies and the horrors of the 



night under propitiatory euphemisms, this writer 
elaborates a graceful periphrasis when referring to 
death. A friend of his, instead of dying as men 
have commonly been in the habit of doing, " passed 
out from his always rather delicate frame, and, after 
a short time in a semi-conscious condition, awoke 
to the reality of being." 

A distinguishing mark of the class of literature 
to which the above-cited work belongs is its dogmatic 
tone, its " cocksureness," its sublime disregard of all 
opposing evidence or proof. " To doubt would be 
disloyalty, to falter would be sin," is the writer's 
motto. From an article on " True Occultism," pub- 
lished in a reputable monthly that has an honored 
place in '* Poole's Index," we take a passage that 
fairly stuns one with stiffly dogmatic affirmations. 
" Occult philosophy teaches, first of all, that man 
must be. The doing is of secondary import. Only 
as he is, can he rightly do. The hidden wisdom of 
the Sphinx and Isis is the same. Is-is (Isis », Be-Be, 
1 1 am that I am,' sums up the secret of all life ; and 
when one knows this law, the powers long hidden in 
his being will arise and crown him king." Note the 
splendid audacity with which the writer cuts the 
etymological knot of the real meaning and derivation 
of the Egyptian goddess's name ! The famous deriva- 
tion of " King Jeremiah " from u pickled cucumber " 
is not more admirable. 

A little dip into a well-known book by a well- 
known apostle of new or newest thought brings up 
the following : " Just behind the seen and material 
human organism there is a sensuous mind, the most 
outward and fleshly of the immaterial part, which 
pertains especially to the body and acts directly upon 
it. Next within is the intellectual zone, and still 
deeper, in the innermost, is the spiritual ego, the 
divine image." This recalls Swedenborg's confident 
assertion that" The human mind is distinguished into 
three regions : the highest, which is also the inmost, 
is called celestial, the middle spiritual, and the 
lowest natural" and makes us wish that we too 
were privileged to know and to declare, without need 
of evidence or argument, some of these sublime 
and awful truths. 

A favorite illusion of the producers of eccentric 
literature is that all the colleges and universities and 
learned bodies the world over are the victims, the 
voluntary victims, of error, and are banded together 
to suppress the truth and to crush all who would be 
its proclaimers. A writer in the magazine already 
cited, moved to utterance by a sense of the wrongs 
of the laboring classes, and a conviction that he has 
discovered the remedy, thus expresses the matter : 
" Those who have consumed their days in prayer- 
ful learning, whose nighdy tapers have waxed dim 
in the examination of the subtlest problems and the 
broadest measurements of human society, should 
they forsooth not be wiser than the unread weak- 
lings of their generation ? . . . Verily, verily. And 
yet the mob is right, and the scholars are the sci- 
olists." The Rev. Edward Dingle, in concluding his 
remarkable work entitled " The Balance of Physics,

the Square of the Circle, and the Earth's True Solar 
and Lunar Distances," which appeared in London 
nearly twenty-five years ago, devoutly exclaims : 
"To the Lord be all thanksgiving, who has kept my 
intellect and the directing of its thoughts sound, 
while seeking to deliver his word from the exulting

Immensely flattering to one's self-love is it to 
imagine oneself the chosen depositary of secrets, 
whether mathematical or physical or celestial, un- 
revealed to the rest of mankind ; and if one is only 
sufficiently determined and sufficiently deaf to 
reason, there is no reason why there should ever be 
any rude awakening. But faith will falter at times, 
and then there comes a shrill note of anger, or a 
blustering attempt to mask one's fear that, after all, 
the other side may be in the right. These depart- 
ures from the placidly self-confident tone are quite 
natural and excusable when the circle-squarer or the 
flat-earth champion has spent life and substance in 
unavailing efforts to convert the rest of the world. 
A bulky volume (whose name and authorship refuse 
to come forth from the mists of the past) essaying 
to prove the absurdity and even iniquity of the 
wave theory of sound, and vehemently denouncing 
Tyndall, Helmholtz, and other teachers of the hated 
doctrine, had some vogue in rural communities, and 
especially among the back-woods ministry, about 
thirty years ago. Again and again were Messrs. 
Tyndall, Helmholtz & Co. driven into a corner, put 
into a hole, held up to scathing ridicule, and shown 
to be the veriest bunglers and blunderers in science. 
Forgetting one's lessons in elementary accoustics, 
and accepting the author's premises and sharing his 
animus, one could not but find the book delightful 
reading ; so gratifying is it to be right, in a minority 
of two, while all the rest of the world is wallowing 
in a bog of hopeless error and wilful delusion. Next 
to being the author of a prodigiously successful and 
world-famous book, what could be more glorious 
than to be the author of a book that is right where 
all other books have been wrong, and whose sales 
are suppressed by the united exertions of the con- 
federated enemies of truth ? 

One of John Fiske's last and best contributions 
to magazine literature was an article on " Some 
Cranks and their Crotchets," in which he pointed out 
some of the stigmata or witch-marks of crankery as 
they are found in books. His experience as assist- 
ant librarian in the Harvard library had made him 
acquainted with many works that well illustrate the 
wide difference between the delicious drollery of the 
wise man and the earnest nonsense of the fool. We 
laugh with the one writer and at the other. In 
nothing does the crank more quickly and surely 
betray his obliquity of vision, when he rushes into 
print, than in his utter failure to see the humorous 
aspect of things. His is the terrible seriousness of 
the little child that cannot smile when it is in earnest. 
If one wishes to make sure that one's books shall 
never be classified by the library cataloguer with 
u insane literature " — or, as Fiske considerately 



decided to style it out of regard for the feelings of 
those abnormal authors who are still with us and are 
in the habit of consulting library catalogues, " eccen- 
tric literature" — it would seem to be only necessary 
never to be so tremendously in earnest as to lose the 
power of laughing at oneself. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Present-day tendencies to mysticism are 
discernible in many quarters. The recent Congress 
of Psychology at Geneva has been considering the 
psychology of religion and theology, and Professor 
Harold Hoeffding of Copenhagen declared that the 
things most important for us to know are unknow- 
able, essentially mysterious, and that the search for 
ultimate reality leads inevitably to mysticism. One 
of the most talked-of and most original of modern 
thinkers, the French philosopher Bergson, shows de- 
cided mystical leanings. The mysterious and the 
wonder-compelling are leading motives in the current, 
drama, as may be seen in recent plays by Messrs. 
Barrie, Hauptmann, and Maeterlinck — in " Peter 
Pan," "The Sunken Bell," and "The Blue Bird." 
All sorts of more or less fantastic and mystical cults 
are in vogue, though to name them might be thought 
invidious. This is called a scientific and practical 
and calmly critical age ; but the more strenuous the 
efforts of the scientist to lay bare naked reality, to 
demonstrate exactly what the ultimate particle of 
matter really is, the more is he baffled and per- 
plexed and forced to take refuge in the non-material 
realm. To learn that the atom is, after all, probably 
nothing but a system of pulsations, or a mode of 
motion, or a centre of mysterious forces, is about as 
definite as the old answer to the question, What is 
matter? — never mind; or, What is mind? — no 
matter. 

The degradation of words, the gradual descent 
in the scale of dignity and respectability of certain 
adjectives and nouns and verbs and adverbs, with 
the constant necessity of finding or coining other 
terms to fill the vacancies, is a subject of more 
than philological interest. Is it because familiarity 
breeds contempt, that words are so continually losing 
caste? or is the unceasing change to which every 
living language is subject simply one illustration of 
the Heraclitean doctrine that all things are in a state 
of flux ? The latest section of the Oxford English 
Dictionary, containing words beginning with S as far 
as Sauce, embraces an unexpected number of these 
discredited or shabby-genteel terms ; and, what is 
worthy of note, these terms are more than likely to 
denote moral qualities. " Saintly " and " sancti- 
monious " are now, in common speech, of uncompli- 
mentary significance. By their side are to be placed 
a long array of adjectives, once denoting none but 
laudable attributes, but now much the worse for wear.

Smith, or as " honest " Jacob Jones, or as "innocent "

Tom Miller, or as " clever " Bob Burly ? Even 
adjectives indicative of intellectual preeminence 
easily assume undesirable implications. "Sapient" 
and in a lesser degree " sagacious " readily lend 
themselves to the uses of satire. After all, our 
language is much like the Chinese: tone of voice or 
accent has to show in what one of various possible 
senses our words are used. 

AN ENTIRELY NEW EDITION OF THE Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica is announced for next year. 
This eminently national work, as solid and substan- 
tial and authoritative as the Bank of England or the 
London 4 ' Times," is now almost a century and a half 
old, and its latest reissue took place twenty or more 
years ago, so that very naturally it fails to meet the 
demand for up-to-date information on such subjects 
as wireless telegraphy, radioactivity, aeronautics, 
pragmatism, psychotherapy, and various others. 
An encyclopaedia, like a library catalogue, is no 
sooner issued than it is out of date, its disease of 
senectitude becoming more and more acute with each 
passing year ; but though librarians have in a measure 
mastered the difficulty of the catalogue by adopting 
the ever-expansible card system, no publisher has 
yet undertaken to supply the world with encyclo- 
paedic learning in card-catalogue form, nor is it a 
form likely to commend itself to the public. Must, 
then, the next-to-the-last edition always be thrown 
away as so much useless lumber ? A report, almost 
too good to be true, is circulating that in this 
instance the Britannica's publishers will take back 
the ninth edition in considerable part-payment for 
the tenth — though one might suggest that it would 
be better to accept the purchaser's affidavit of pro- 
prietorship in the earlier edition and save the freight 
thereon, which might go toward diminishing still 
further the reduced rate at which the new work is 
offered to owners of the old. 

THE TRAVEL-TALE AS A FAVORITE FORM OF LIT- 
ERARY hoax furnishes food for reflection. Just 
at present, when the civilized world is absorbed in 
details of the exploration of the Northern Pole, the j 
historic instances are being recalled of published | 
travels and discoveries and explorations that enter- 
tained and perhaps instructed the world, but lacked j 
the essential if prosaic element of truth. The 
benevolent Father Hennepin's voyage down the ! 
Mississippi to its very mouth, as recorded in the ! 
later and more elaborate edition of his Journal, was 
largely a stay-at-home journey. Louis de Rouge- 
mont's marvellous experience as chief of a cannibal 
tribe in the wilds of interior Australia was received ' 
with raptures of astonishment — until an unpoetic 
wife of the romancer rudely upset the airy fabric ! 
of her husband's fertile fancy. Like those foolish ! 
fishes that will even gulp down an unbaited hook, ; 
the dear public has delighted to be humbugged by 
the most barefaced of frauds. A Boston newspaper 
once printed, in jocose mood, a detailed description 



of a vessel of the Swiss navy that was announced 
to have arrived at that port ; and the article was 
copied by other journals in good faith and solemnly 
read by hundreds as a genuine news item. The love 
of fairy tales does not die out with the shedding of 
the milk-teeth. 

The advantages of a layman's point of vtew, 
in literature, in art, and even in matters more 
severely technical and special, is often unquestion- 
able. Detachment and impartiality are not easily 
maintained by those in the thick of the fight. Mr. 
Bernhard Berenson, the well-known art critic, on 
reading a letter by an American painter harshly 
criticising Titian and Tintoretto and the Venetian 
school in general, is reported to have expressed an 
emphatic opinion on the impossibility of being at the 
same time a great artist and a competent critic of 
art. The painter, said he, "gets so thoroughly in 
the habit of his own manner and form, his own way 
of seeing things, that when he looks at the work of 
other men all he notices is that they don't paint as 
he does. He is more narrow-minded in his criticism 
even than a layman who knows nothing about the 
subject." In the field of letters, Robert Buchanan's 
famous assault on Rossetti (" The Fleshly School of 
Poetry ") is an instance of narrow and unjust criti- 
cism of one writer's work by another. And there 
are many others. No man who is himself in the 
arena, helping to stir up the dust, can command a 
clear view of his competitors. 

Lord Bacon as a writer of verse ought as- 
suredly to have had no great difficulty in keeping 
his own identity from getting mixed up with that 
of a certain author of sundry plays and sonnets that 
have since acquired fame. In " The Nineteenth 
Century " for August Sir Edward Sullivan has a 
well-considered and reasonably convincing article 
on " Francis Bacon as a Poet," with illustrative if 
not highly exhilarating extracts from the erudite 
nobleman's " Translations of Certain Psalms into 
English Verse" and "Apothegms New and Old." 
On the whole, few readers of unbiased minds will 
find any difficulty in subscribing, with the author of 
the article, to Spedding's opinion that there are 
probably " not five consecutive lines in either Bacon 
or Shakespeare that could possibly be interchanged, 
and not recognized at once by any person familiar 
with their styles." This, from the man whose life- 
work was the editing and the " whitewashing " of 
Bacon, should carry weight. 

" FXETCHERISM " APPLIED TO READING might 

work wonders in curing intellectual dyspepsia, build-

vigor of the brain, and increasing the patient's intel- 
lectual weight. When one contemplates the square 
yards of daily paper, especially of Sunday paper,

rudis indigestaque moles, to let it gallop through the 
alimentary canal of the intellect without being one- 
thousandth part assimilated, one marvels that soft- 
ening of the brain is not a hundred times more 
prevalent than it actually is, and one feels almost 
inclined to organize a boycott against all publishers 
(of whom newspaper publishers are the chief offend- 
ers) whose output is more remarkable for quantity 
than quality. For nineteen cents a day, declares 
one enthusiastic Fletcherite, a judicious person can

more richly nourish the system than a many-course 
Delmoniconian bill of fare costing several dollars. 
A small fraction of the world's present expenditure 
on ephemeral reading matter — ephemeral literally 
and in its Greek sense — would purchase enough 
good, mind-nourishing, heart-sustaining literature to 
give every reader at least a modicum of true culture. 

A FEROCIOUS VOCABULARY OF PEACEFUL SPORTS 

has been gradually developed by those enthusiastic 
attendants at baseball games whose vivid emotions 
at sight of a three-base hit or a neat double-play or 
a left-handed catch of a red-hot liner find all ordinary 
idioms too tame for tolerance. No wonder the foreign 
reader of our newspapers thinks us a most blood- 
thirsty people in our way of playing the great Amer- 
ican game, when he finds that a baseball nine is 
calmly referred to as having devoured its opponents ; 
a base-runner dies at second, or expires on third ; 
another is nailed at the plate, or is thrown out in 
trying to steal second ; and a pitcher may receive 
so terrible a lacing that one marvels how he can 
ever muster courage to play again. In a compara- 
tively sober and sedate journal of recent date, we 
find the baseball section headed thus : '* More Meat 
for Tigers — Find Yankees Toothsome Morsels for 
Sunday Feast." The extensive and varied termin- 
ology of the game is enough to puzzle and daunt the 
uninitiated, leading him to expect something far 
more elaborately barbarous than a Spanish bull-fight, 
and perhaps as terrifying as an old-fashioned execu- 
tion with preliminary torture and final dismember- 
ment. But we are now at the tail-end of the season, 
and the press will soon cease, for a while, from 
frightening the innocent with violent metaphor and 
sanguinary phrase in its baseball columns.

An American scholar's study of Sterne (we 
refer to Professor Wilbur L. Cross's " Life and 
Times " of that author) is meeting with gratifying 
success in the country of Sterne's birth. Some time 
ago the supply of the book furnished by the Mac- 
millans for English consumption was reported all 
sold out, which in the sluggish summer season is 
convincing proof of the book's worth as an interest- 
awakener. Being the first important work on its 
subject since Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's two-volume 
biography of Sterne, published in 1864, and being 
moreover from the pen of an American, it was only 
natural that the book should excite curiosity ; and 
it is pleasant to learn that its purchasers do not 



appear to complain that they have failed to receive 
their money's worth. In this connection, and as an 
additional evidence that Americans look upon the 
great English writers and their literary productions 
not by any means as alien to themselves, we are 
glad to receive word that the custodian of the ceme- 
tery where Sterne was buried affirms that most of 
the visitors to his grave are from the United States. 

A new definition of culture, to be added to 
the dozen or more that almost everybody can recall 
or invent, comes from President Hadley. His defi- 
nition, or rather his latest definition, makes culture 
" the opposite of absorption in the obvious," the low- 
est plane of the obvious being reached in pleasures 
arising from the gratification of the animal nature. 
" The obvious," he explains, " is that which gets in 
our way — the thing we cannot help seeing in its 
full size. The cultivated man or woman is the one 
who in the various fields of life . . . values in proper 
proportion the things which are unseen, or at best 
very imperfectly seen, by the less trained vision." 
These words of wisdom are timely and reassuring. 
Business is looking up, prosperity is reviving, the 
autumn will see " bumper " crops of various cereals, 
and without this reminder from President Hadley 
we might for a moment have forgotten the tempo- 
rality of the seen and the eternity of the unseen. 

The life of library books may seem short to 
one observing how quickly they become shabby, how 
soon they have to be rebound, and how inevitably the 
most popular among them require replacing at brief 
intervals. But it must be remembered to what wear 
and tear a reading community subjects its library 
books. The latest report of the Galesburg (111.) 
Public Library states the size of its collection as 
36,930 volumes, and its circulation as 152,277 for 
the year, besides a reference-room record of 43,127 
books consulted. These bare statistics are rich in 
significance to one familiar with library business. 
Nevertheless, pressure should be brought to bear on 
publishers and printers and book-binders to give more 
attention to the physical durability of their product. 

The two-mill tax for public libraries is 
not exactly a princely allowance for that highly 
important branch of our educational system. In 
the current report of the Nebraska Public Library 
Commission, President Haller, of the Omaha Public 
Library, pleads for a higher maximum levy, espe- 
cially for small towns. Three years ago, as he 
points out, Iowa passed a law permitting cities and 
towns with a population of six thousand or less to 
levy a tax of three mills on the dollar for public 
library support. Kansas also has taken a similar 
step. It is encouraging to note the interest of 
Nebraska's foreign population in public libraries. 
The Bohemians have clubbed together and bought 
seven hundred volumes in their language, and have 
presented the collection to the State, to be used in 
the form of travelling libraries.

HOBHOUSE, FRIEXD OF BYROX.* 

In 1865 Lord Broughton, then nearly eighty 
years old, caused to be printed for private cir- 
culation his " Recollections of a Long Life " in 
five volumes ; and on his death, four years later, 
he left in the custody of the British Museum a 
mass of papers, including a diary, his correspon- 
dence, and further memoirs, all to remain under 
his seal until the end of the century. Now at 
length, nine years after the seal of secrecy has 
been removed, his only surviving child (his 
second daughter, Charlotte, Lady Dorchester) 
publishes a two-volume compilation from the 
" Recollections," pieced out with extracts from 
the diary and other papers, giving the work the 
same title as that chosen by her father for his 
privately-printed reminiscences. 

The present work is confined wholly to the 
earlier period of Lord Broughton's life — the 
period of his intimate friendship with Byron, 
the records of which furnish the most import- 
ant portions of the material. As John Cam 
Hobhouse (the name by which he was called 
until his father's death in 1831), he is well 
known to all who are familiar with Byron liter- 
ature, especially from his profuse annotations 
of " Childe Harold." He was Byron's fellow- 
collegian and fellow-traveller, the confidant of 
the poet in his unhappy matrimonial venture, 
and executor of his last will and testament. 
His acquaintance was, in fact, extensive among 
all the celebrities of his time — literary, social, 
political, diplomatic, military. A single para- 
graph in his diary, describing a ball at the 
English Embassy in Paris, contains the follow- 
ing names: Lord Wellington, Marshal Bliicher, 
the Czar of Russia, Prince Metternich, Platow, 
Schwarzenberg, Barclay de Tolly, Prince 
Stadion, the Prussian royal family (except the 
King), the Bavarian royal princes, De Wrede, 
Lord Castlereagh, Marshal Ney, and others of 
less note. The great Napoleon was at least 
once closely viewed by him, the occasion being 
a military review, shortly before the battle of 
Waterloo. Napoleon is thus portrayed by his 
young English admirer: 

" I had for some time a most complete opportunity 
of contemplating this extraordinary being. His face is 
the very counterpart of Sir James Craufurd the runa-

private diaries. Edited by his daughter, Lady Dorchester.

way, and when he speaks he has the same retraction of 
his lips as that worthy baronet. His face is of a deadly 
pale, his jaws overhanging, but not so much as 1 had 
heard. His hair is short, of a dark, dusky brown. The 
lady in the Tuileries told me the soldiers called him 
notre petit tondu. He generally stood with his hands knit 
behind him or folded before him. Three or four times he 
took snuff out of a plain brown box; once looked at his 
watch, which, by the way, had a gold face, and, I think, 
a brown hair chain, like an English one. His teeth 
seemed regular, but not clean. He very seldom spoke, 
but when he did, smiled in some sort agreeably. He 
looked about him, not knitting but joining his eyebrows. 
He caught my eye, and soon withdrew his gaze, natur- 
ally enough the first, I having only him to look at, he 
having some thirty thousand. As the front of each 
regiment passed he put up the first finger of his left 
hand quickly to his hat to salute, but did not move his 
head or hat. He had an air of sedate impatience. . . . 
I did not see Napoleon equally well at all times, but 
stood, during the whole review, close to him, gazing at 
him through hats and a musket or two on tip-toe. I 
positively found my eyes moistened at the sight of the 
world's wonder — the same admiration of great actions 
which has often made me cry at a trait of Greek or 
Roman virtue caused this weakness." 
He continues to describe the " gratification and 
melancholy delight " with which he viewed " the 
man who has played the most extraordinary, 
gigantic part of any human being in ancient 
and modern times." 

Among the many interesting characters that 
figure in these pages are Lord and Lady Mel- 
bourne, the parents of Queen Victoria's minister, 
with their vivacious and refractory daughter-in- 
law, Lady Caroline Lamb, the alleged original 
of five heroines of fiction before Mrs. Humphry 
Ward revived her fame in the character of Lady 
Kitty Ashe. The tender relations supposed to 
have existed at one time between Lady Caroline 
and Byron are of course known to all the world, 
but the poet's friend appears not to make this 
delicate affair a subject for comment in his diary 
and reminiscences, so far as they are now pub- 
lished. One brief entry, however, records that 
" Lady Caroline Lamb is come to town and is 
in mischievous activity," and another page has 
the characteristic utterance from that lively lady 
that truth is " what one thinks at the moment." 
From a passage dated March 21, 1814, it ap- 
pears that Hobhouse was in some way partly 
responsible for the vexations and sorrows that 
Lady Caroline Lamb brought upon her husband. 

"This evening I went to a very small early party 
at Lady Lansdowne's, where there were not above 150 
people present. I saw and spoke to a good many people 
I knew, but felt miserable, in spite of what used to re- 
vive me — kind words from Adair, etc. Lord Byron, 
whom I love more and more every day, not so much 
from his fame as his fondness — I think not equivocal, 
for me — introduced me, at her desire, to Lady Mel- 
bourne. Whether from habit or not I know not, but

she trembled when she spoke to me. She certainly, as 
she says of me, does owe me an ill turn for preventing 
her son from losing a bad wife. 1 told her a fib to please 
her about her son being popular in Vienna. Byron took 
me home in his carriage, and I sat with him an hour." 

A contemporaneous judgment of Byron's 
poetry, together with a glimpse of the poet's 
own opinion of his work, is afforded in this 
passage : 

" The great success of ' Childe Harold ' is due chiefly 
to Byron's having dared to give utterance to certain 
feelings which every one must have encouraged in the 
melancholy and therefore morbid hours of his existence, 
and also by the intimate knowledge which he has shown 
of the turns taken by the passions of women. He says 
himself that his poems are of that sort, which will, like 
everything of the kind in these days, pass away, and 
give place to the ancient reading, but that he esteems 
himself fortunate in getting all that can now be got by 
such a passing reputation, for which there are so many 
competitors." 

There is an unmistakably human quality in a 
passing reference to the Edinburgh Review's 
praise of Byron as a first poet of the day. 
" Rogers called and said to him, ' How will Scott 
like this ? and how will Campbell like this? ' — 
all the time thinking of himself. Campbell and 
Scott mutually hate and abuse each other." 

Mr. Hobhouse was, it seems, an eye-witness of 
Byron's famous exploit of swimming the Helles- 
pont, of which the poet says in " Don Juan": 

" As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided) 
Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did." 

Here is Mr. Hobhouse's account of the incident : 

" We left [Smyrna] in the Salsette frigate, Captain 
Bathurst, and went by Mitylene [sic] to the Dardanelles. 
Byron and Mr. Ekenhead swam across the Hellespont 
to-day. Ekenhead performed this feat in an hour and 
five minutes, and Byron in an hour and ten minutes. 
They set off two miles above Europe Castle, and came 
out at least a mile below the Dardanelles." 

The chief interest of course attaches to the 
personal reminiscences of Byron, which are so 
plentiful in these volumes. The accounts of 
Byron's marriage and subsequent matrimonial 
difficulties will be turned to by many readers. 
Hobhouse was present at the marriage cere- 
mony, of which he gives many piquant details. 
When he wished the bride many years of hap- 
piness, she replied, " If I am not happy it will 
be my own fault." Hobhouse, himself still a 
bachelor, felt as if he had " buried a friend." 
In the closing chapter — a long one — he gives 
an extended account of "The Byron Separation." 
Into the details of this much-discussed affair 
we cannot enter. To those who care for the 
kind of matter furnished in abundance by this 
authoritative and doubtless important chapter, 
it will prove most interesting, as will also the 



appended letters having chiefly to do with Lord 
Byron's affairs. 

Of somewhat lesser interest are the introduc- 
tory notes furnished by the English publisher 
(Mr. John Murray, whose ancestor, of the same 
name and calling, is said to have made a living, 
and something more, out of Byron's works) and 
Lord Rosebery. These prefaces are short, it is 
true, and tell us little of importance ; but they 
gracefully prepare the way for the leading char- 
acters of the book. The portraits, though few, 
are a welcome addition to the text ; and the 
printing and general style of the volumes are 
all that the most exacting could desire. Unavoid- 
ably, there are here, as in all published diaries 
and reminiscences and letters, many paragraphs 
and even pages that record matters of small 
importance ; but they are doubtless more neces- 
sary for the total correct impression than the 
reader at first realizes. However, if Lady 
Dorchester should feel encouraged to continue 
her editorial task and make public further 
records of her father's long life, the events of his 
later years might, one would judge, be advan- 
tageously compressed into far less bulk than 
they occupy in the writer's chronicle. Consid- 
erable omissions, it is evident, have been made 
in compiling these first two volumes. A sequel 
of some sort, long or short, is what they now 
seem to demand. Percy F. Bicknell. 



A Naturalist in Southern Mexico.* 



Travel books about Mexico are almost too 
numerous. The man who makes a three weeks' 
trip into the country on a Pullman car often 
feels impelled to write a book. He knew noth- 
ing of Mexico when he started, nothing when he 
returned ; but somehow or other his impres- 
sions and criticisms and advice get into print. 
Of such books there are more than plenty. But 
now and then it happens that a traveller really 
visits some little-known region of Mexico, for 
some specific and interesting purpose ; and from 
him a book is welcome. Hans Gadow's "Through 
Southern Mexico " is such a book. He has 
travelled widely through the less-known parts 
of our neighboring republic, and has conducted 
investigations of so serious and interesting a 
character that his narrative abounds in new and 
curious matter. 

Few fields are more interesting to the natur-

alist. The keen investigator is sure to discover 
valuable unknown material. A single American 
collector, Pringle, has made known a fourth of 
the recognized flora of Mexico ; Nelson has per- 
haps doubled the list of known mammals ; out 
of two hundred and twenty-seven species de- 
scribed in Meek's " Fresh- water Fishes of 
Mexico," more than fifty were discovered or 
named by the author ; Wheeler and Tower find 
the entomological field almost untouched. No 
wonder that students are turning to Mexico, 
and that such interesting narratives are appear- 
ing as Baker's "Naturalist in Mexico" and 
Beebe's " Two Bird Lovers in Mexico." But 
neither Baker nor Beebe went far off of beaten 
tracks ; Gadow did. His specialty was reptiles 
and batrachians ; his greatest interest was in the 
species distribution of animals and plants with 
reference to their environmental conditions ; his 
field was the tropical forest and mountain coun- 
try of the States of Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, and 
Guerrero. His neighbors, when he was at work, 
were such Indian tribes as the Mixtecs and 
Zapotecs, and the much less known Mazatecs 
and Juaves. He camped for days on the great 
mountain Citlaltepetl (Orizaba), the highest in 
Mexico, whose towering snow-cap, popularly 
known as " El Pico," is the finest landmark in 
the Republic, and his observations there on alti- 
tudinal distribution are exceptional in interest 
and value. While the work is a narrative of 
personal travel and experience, the author dis- 
cusses many curious topics, such as the features 
of the tropical forest, coral snakes and warning 
colors, rattlesnakes and the evolution of the 
rattle, four-eyed fish, etc. 

The author gives a necessary caution in his 
preface. " Care has been taken to mention the 
various creatures at the time and place that we 
observed them. The country swarms with life, 
and yet days may pass without a glimpse of any- 
thing worth relating, and the best finds are made 
unexpectedly." A striking illustration of this 
fact is given. The author had stopped at Pre- 
sidio station, in the State of Vera Cruz, and was 
out searching. 

" Whilst rambling along the edge of the forest we 
became conscious of a noise, at first resembling the mut- 
ter of a distant sawmill; but on our reaching the other 
side of a cluster of trees, this sound grew into a roar, like 
that of steam escaping from many engines, mingled with 
the sharp and piercing scream of saws. It came from 
a meadow containing a shallow pool of rainwater. In 
the wet grass, on its stalks, and on the ground, hopped 
about hundreds of large green tree-frogs; nearer the 
pond they were to be seen in thousands, and in the water 
itself were tens of thousands. . . . The din was so great 
that it was with difficulty that we caught the remarks 



that we shouted, although we were standing only a few 
feet apart. . . . Now the grassy pool, where the frogs 
were closest, was about thirty yards square (900 square 
yards) . . . and each square yard held from fifty to 
one hundred frogs — many square yards certainly held 
several hundred each. At the lowest computation this 
gives 45,000 frogs; . . . supposing there were only 
20,000 females, each spawning . . . only 5000 eggs . . . 
the total would amount to one hundred million eggs. 
The spawn literally covered the ground and water 
thickly. But the greatest surprise awaited us on the 
following morning, when we went to photograph the 
scene. There was not a single frog left; the water had 
all evaporated, and the whole place was glazed over 
with dried-up spawn." 

Though this was one of the commonest of the 
tropical Mexican frogs, Gadow saw in all the 
rest of his month's field-work only eight or ten 
specimens ! 

While his original observations are of the 
highest interest, and an actual contribution to 
knowledge, Dr. Gadow makes rather frequent 
slips in Spanish, and in statements of common- 
place things and conditions. Thus, he uses 
the word plantanos for platanos, which is the 
general name for bananas and plantains ; he 
repeatedly uses the word bejugo (a vine or liana) 
for bejuco ; and he gives chicla for chicle. He 
should surely not mention a " cathedral " at 
Orizaba. And he falls into an ordinary tourists' 
blunder in speaking of " pigskin " bottles for 
pulque. These are relatively small matters. 
Dr. Gadow's book is a valuable contribution 
to Mexicana, because he went where few have 
gone, and did what none have done.

The Study of Modern Exgeish.* 



Unlike a large majority of recent books on 
the English language, the work on Modern 
English by Dr. Krapp of Columbia can abund- 
antly justify its existence. It has a point to 
make worth making, and it makes it well. 
While the very reverse of provincial, it is a 
book that could hardly have been written any- 
where but in America, its note throughout being 
frankly and refreshingly democratic. Its con- 
clusions, therefore, are not likely to find full 
favor with the creators of artificial " authority," 
or with academic conservatives in general. But 
to all who believe in the sometimes forgotten 
thesis that language is made for man, and espe- 
cially to teachers of English whose tendency to 
grow dogmatic is increased unconsciously by the

dogmatism of their text-books, the saneness and 
calm cogency of such a chapter as that on 
" English Sounds " should be both helpful and 
welcome. The book is attractively printed, and, 
for a first edition, is commendably free from 
textual errors ; " ealde " for ealdan (p. 95, 1. 2) 
and " starbord " for starboard (p. 190, 1. 2) 
are rare instances. 

Coming to statements of fact, one is inclined 
at times to question, at others to take positive 
issue. It is true (p. 147) that " too is the 
stressed form of which " to " is the frequently un- 
stressed ; but why say that " of " is the unstressed 
form of which " off " is the stressed ? The facts 
of stress are of course as stated, but why couple 
in this fashion words that phonetically have not 
an element in common ? Again (p. 199), in the 
illustrations of verbs usually intransitive be- 
coming transitive, "to walk a horse" is well 
chosen. In " to walk the streets," " to jump a 
fence," however, "the streets " and " a fence " 
seem essentially (logically, as Doctor Krapp 
would put it) to be adverbs ; nor in " I walk 
the deck my Captain lies " is there anything 
of a transitive nature in the verbs. Finally 
(p. 254), " habit " (meaning dress) is listed 
among the French words brought into contem- 
porary English. What about " Costly thy habit 
as thy purse can buy "? 

A more serious indictment must be brought 
against the style of the book. There is no 
reason why scientific prose should fail in 
euphony or be wasteful of a reader's powers, 
and such faults are especially to be condemned 
when language is the theme ; let us give to our 
German philologists a monopoly of the lumber- 
ing and the harsh. Speaking generally, our 
author is sounder in his grammatical principles 
than in his rhetorical practice ; we doubt, though, 
whether he would give deliberate approval to 
these sad examples of the cacophonous : (p. 171) 
" The contemporary imperfectly educated per- 
son "; (p. 220) " two historically clearly distin- 
guishable strands "; (p. 293) " are generally 
unmistakably determined"; (p. 123) "only 
approximately correctly." Again, to use a 
technical terminology ^ the style is faulty in its 
collocation of correlatives: (p. 32) "Since 
instruction in English was no longer given in 
the schools, but only in French"; (p. 35) 
" In Chaucer we have one who was not only a 
consummate artist in the use of language, but 
one also who . . . could sound ..." Should 
it be argued that these faults are venial, if indeed 
they are faults at all, and that the English- 
speaking public grows less and less insistent on 



the niceties of arrangement and of sound, it may 
be answered that some of the rules of rhetoric 
(all the valid ones, says Spencer) are grounded 
in the conserving of energy, and that the prin- 
ciples of such conservation do not derive their 
authority from the judgment of majorities. 
Some of those principles, let us make bold to 
say, strike their roots deep down into ethics. 
Even if the faults thus far referred to are 
rhetorical peccadilloes, the following sentence 
(p. 138) is nothing short of a rhetorical crime : 
" The pronunciation, however, still persists as a 
survival in the speech of old-fashioned people, 
and, since they are always slower in arriving at 
imitative innovations than the educated, it per- 
sists also in the speech of the ' ignorant ' and 
' uneducated.' " One reaches the end of the 
sentence before discovering fully that his inevi- 
table reference of " they " to " old-fashioned 
people " has thrown him from the track of the 
thought. It is neither good sense nor good 
morals for an author thus needlessly to exhaust 
his reader's time and patience. 

But these are surface failings. The book 
itself is an exceptionally good one, and will 
doubtless be read widely and with profit.

Memoirs of a Royalist Exile.* 



Memoirs are oftenest read because of the 
importance of the role played by their writer, 
and occasionally for the evidence they furnish 
toward the settlement of some interesting his- 
torical question. Neither of these uses render 
noteworthy the " Recollections of the Baron de 
Frenilly." He was not a distinguished man, 
although he attained a certain prominence 
during the Restoration among those who were 
" more royalist than the king." He wrote his 
memoirs so late in life, and when separated so 
completely from the means of verifying what 
recurred to his mind, that his testimony cannot 
be accepted upon any matter requiring exact- 
ness of statement. And yet these " Recollec- 
tions," once begun, will probably be read to 
the last page, and if read will not soon be 
forgotten nor regarded as without historical 
interest. The reason is that Frenilly had an 
artist's sense for the; value of every stroke in 
the portraits that fill his pages ; his memory 
notes with the vividness of a fresh impression 
the characteristics of the changing phases of

society from the Old Regime to the Restoration ; 
and his wit is quick and keen, and as free from 
artificiality as a bubbling spring. His peculiar 
quality is a frankness, full of surprises, astound- 
ing in its comprehensiveness, only to be ex- 
plained if we believe him when he says, " My 
story is a secret, a disclosure made only to 
myself," written to divert weary hours of a 
long exile from France after the overthrow of 
Charles X. 

Frenilly was not of the old nobility, but 
belonged to one of the families of the haute 
Jinance. His uncle, of whom he was heir, was 
administrator-general of the royal domain, and 
his father had been receiver-general of the appan- 
ages of the Count of Artois in Poitou and Angou- 
mois. These financial families had an identity of 
interest with the nobility, and no noble detested 
the Revolution more heartily than did the young 
Frenilly. But he was unwilling to emigrate. 
He looked back upon the emigration as " a 
painful sacrifice followed by a loyal dupery," 
and declared that " it alone, and not decrees, 
destroyed the nobility." During the Terror he 
lived on one of his Touraine estates, although 
occasionally he came to Paris. He was on the 
Rue St. Honore when the cart passed which bore 
Dan ton to the scaffold. In that cart was also 
Herault de Sechelles, ex-member of the Com- 
mittee of Public Safety, who, when an officer of 
the old Parlement of Paris, had received Frenilly 
as an advocate, and whom his mother had once 
regarded as a desirable husband for his sister. 
Although at one time during the Directory he 
was on the point of entering the service of the 
government, he took no part in politics until 
the Restoration, when he became a pamphleteer 
for the Ultras. Toward the close of Villele's 
administration, realizing that in current estima- 
tion a " peerage was equivalent to a dowry of a 
million, and my son would soon be twenty-four 
years of age,'' he asked that his name be included 
in the rumored creation, but was chagrined to 
find there were so many on the list. With a 
few exceptions they were " the flower of France. 
. . . But this did not excuse them from the 
crime of being seventy-six." 

Frenilly had a sense of humor as well as a 
keen wit. A play of his was accepted at the 
Vaudeville, but " before half the first scene had 
been played I said to myself, ' Oh ! but this is 
execrable ! ' The public was of the same opinion, 
and, whilst my friends kept applauding, hissed 
with all its strength. I ended by heartily hiss- 
ing myself ; for the further the play progressed 
the more convinced I was that the people were ! 



right." Afterwards he went to a dinner where 
wreaths of triumph were awaiting him, and told 
his adventure with such relish that everybody 
joined him in the laughter. 

His description of the beginning of the over- 
tures which led to his marriage is an example 
of his manner of telling his story. His notary 
said to him in 1800 : " ' Sir, you must think of 
marrying. I have a match to propose to you — 
a widow.' I made a grimace. ' Young,' he 
added. I smiled. ' And who possesses a very 
fine estate near Paris.' I listened." The 
" Recollections " are also full of amusing anec- 
dotes. One relates that an officer after a battle 
was supervising the burial of the dead, and 
thinking he saw some of the bodies move, in- 
formed the grave-diggers. " Let them be, sir," 
replied one of the men ; " if we listened to them, 
not one of them would be dead." 

Frenilly's portraits are entirely without 
malice, although this would be a poor solace to 
some of the passing subjects of his pencil — for 
example, to that farmer-general, M. Delahante, 
who was " at bottom an excellent person," 
although he was " a tall, bony, square-shouldered 
man, with a dry, hard, vulgar face, and who 
smelt of money a mile off." He speaks of the 
Academician Bailly with appreciative warmth, 
adding, however, these sentences, a propos of 
his election as mayor of Paris : 

" His modesty capitulated, he thought himself a great 
man, and he became ridiculous. Heaven had granted 
him a wife who was exactly proportioned to his entre- 
sol in the Louvre: a good housekeeper and nurse who 
adored him, a talkative, common, ignorant, stupid 
woman. . . . Behold her through a stroke of the wand, 
seated in an immense gilded salon thronged with citizens 
and courtiers, and you may imagine what a powerful 
auxiliary she was to the sarcasms which were already 
showering upon her poor husband." 

His contempt for Talleyrand breaks out in the 
description of the festival of the Federation, 
July 14, 1790, when "this little bishop, a dis- 
solute and lame atheist and gambler, was the 
only person that could be found to say that 
famous high mass in the open air, and which 
the heavens seemed to take pleasure in drown- 
ing every five minutes by torrents of rain." 
Frenilly's mother thought Lafayette a hero, 
but he called him a Gilles Cesar, in which, by 
the way, he agreed with Talleyrand's estimate. 
The chief historical interest of the memoirs 
belongs to the descriptions of social life before 
the Revolution, the coming of which Frenilly 
thought was foreshadowed by an abandonment 
of the good old customs. His account of the 
training of a boy for social duties is especially

clear, and includes an amusing interview with 
Voltaire. The reorganization of society during 
the Directory is also illustrated with curious 
details. It should be remarked that the trans- 
lator has been able to an unusual degree to pre- 
serve the liveliness of the original. M. Chuquet 
has added valuable biographical notes upon the 
many personages mentioned by Frenilly.

Recent Fiction.* 



A boy of New England extraction, whose father 
was one of the army of settlers who journeyed to 
Kansas that its soil might be dedicated to freedom, 
comes to our acquaintance in the opening pages 
of "A Certain Rich Man," by Mr. William Allen 
White, and remains the central figure of a narrative 
that covers more than half a century of his career. 
The father did not get beyond the Mississippi, for 
his life was the price of an abolitionist sermon he 
preached one day, but the mother and the child 
found their way, first to Lawrence, then to Sycamore 
Ridge. The boy grows up in the midst of the 
struggle for the salvation of the territory, and is 
eleven years old at the outbreak of the war. When 
the first volunteers march away from Sycamore 
Ridge, he contrives to go with them as a stowaway, 
and is not discovered and sent back until he has 
become mixed up in a skirmish, and received a

wound in the heel that makes him limp for the rest 
of his life. The story up to this point is very 
engaging, and the boy's character as well ; for 
Mr. White understands boy psychology, and John 
Barclay is an authentic example of his kind. He 
holds our sympathies while he struggles for an edu- 
cation, and while his first heart flutterings seem to 
promise a sentimental development of the plot. But 
the author is not for sentiment, except as an acces- 
sory, and we gradually become aware that John's 
chief aim in life is to be money-getting. As a boy, 
he makes us uncomfortable by his sharp practice, 
and the older he grows the more the soul shrivels up 
within him. The bulk of Mr. White's novel is de- 
voted to describing the process by which John Barclay 
becomes one of the wealthiest men in America. His 
success is brought about by shrewd farsightedness, 
absolute unscrupulousness, and the wholesale corrup- 
tion of courts and legislatures. He is, in short, the 
typical bogey-man of the muck-raking magazine. 
This part of the story is so overloaded with detail 
as to be unsuff erably tedious. Fortunately, the book 
also makes us acquainted with many other people, 
more humanly interesting ; for it offers an epitome 
of the life of Sycamore Ridge, as the town grows 
from its very beginnings into a sizable city. The 
many characters are thrown together in the novel 
much as they are thrown together in life, and there 
is little evidence of artistic plan or grouping. The 
writer's knowledge, powers of observation, and 
pointed style impart a considerable degree of interest 
to his story, despite its amorphous structure. He 
affects, with imperfect success, the confidential 
manner of Thackeray, and indulges in homily or 
reminiscence as his vagrant fancy bids. The proper 
moral of such a story is that the millionaire hero 
should find his wealth dust and ashes, and this moral 
Mr. White properly points. But he makes rather 
a mess of the rich man's change of heart ; there is 
much pathos and little verisimiltude in the account 
of his regeneration. 

Mr. John Reed Scott, forsaking the imaginary 
kingdoms and fair princesses with which his inven- 
tion has hitherto entertained us, now gives us a story 
of our own time and country, entitled " The Woman 
in Question." The woman is a beautiful creature 
who lives a secluded life in rural Virginia, where 
she is discovered by the hero when he deserts city 
for country in order to take possession of the ances- 
tral estate which he has recently inherited. She is 
a woman with a past (which provides the element 
of mystery), and her past confronts her when the 
hero brings a house party to his new home, for one 
of his guests turns out to be the man whom the 
heroine had married when a mere girl, and from 
whom she had afterwards fled in disgust. She pre- 
tends, when she meets him, that he is a total stranger 
to her ; and her self-possession is such that he is puz- 
zled, for it is ten years since they parted, and both 
nature and art have changed her appearance. By 
means of a stratagem, however, he makes sure of 
her identity, and then, being a thorough-going

villain of melodrama, he seeks to use his knowledge 
for purposes of blackmail. Already an embezzler, 
his plight is desperate, and the only way out of it is 
for him to get killed, which he does to the satisfac- 
tion of all concerned. Thereupon the hero claims 
possession, and his plea does not go unheeded. It 
makes an ingenious and interesting narrative, light- 
hearted (except for the underlying tragedy), and 
gracefully related. 

A new writer and almost a new subject claim 
our attention in Mr. Eugene Paul Metour's tale of 
romantic adventure in North Africa, entitled " In 
the Wake of the Green Banner." It is a story of 
our own days, of the French occupation of Morocco, 
and of factional Moorish strife. Vivid in coloring 
and brilliant in description, it is the work of a writer 
who has first-hand knowledge of his subject — knows 
it, in fact, almost too well for the reader's comfort, 
who would like to have the political situation more 
fully explained, and who is in danger of much be- 
wilderment at the strange local vocabulary. The 
opening chapters, describing Marakesh and its 
capture by a fanatical Moslem horde, with the con- 
sequent massacre or expulsion of the French, are 
much the best of the book ; if their promise were 
fulfilled in those that follow, the story would be a 
strong one indeed. But from the time when the 
little band of persons in whom we are interested 
make their escape from the city, and enter upon 
their toilsome journey through the desert, the story 
has little plan or coherence. From that point on, it 
is a chain of loosely-linked episodes, leading to noth- 
ing in particular but a good deal of fighting and the 
final escape of the leading characters. It is weak 
also in its delineation of these characters. Neither 
the Corsican hero, the French- American heroine, nor 
her American artist-cousin is distintly realized from 
within ; in this respect, the author has been more 
successful with some of his native types. 

" The Plotting of Frances "Ware," by Mr. James 
Locke, has for its hero a Polish patriot who works 
against the Russian government, and meets the 
usual fate of such conspirators. We first meet him 
on a Siberian convict-train, from which he makes a 
daring escape. Many months later, he turns up in 
Turkestan, a wild-eyed refugee, and there wins sym- 
pathy and protection from an American archaeologist 
engaged in scientific exploration. Professor Ware's 
companion in this expedition is his sister, Frances 
Ware, who is so fascinated by the refugee that she 
gives him her heart. Presently he negotiates suc- 
cessfully the dangers of the Russian frontier, reaches 
safety in Paris, and there, after Frances has also 
returned, persuades her into a marriage. The scene 
then shifts to Warsaw, whither the couple go in dis- 
guise, ostensibly to regain possession of certain 
property, but really (although the fact is concealed 
from the wife ) to take part in a new and desperate 
conspiracy. The plot fails, the hero becoming the 
victim of treachery, and the heroine being saved 
through the efforts of the British consul. It makes 
a straightforward and highly interesting story, swift 



and logical in movement, and not too harrowing to 
our feelings, for the hero's weakness and deceitful- 
ness are apparent enough to us (although the hero- 
ine sees only the lovable aspect of his character), 
and we feel sure that he will be succeeded after 
a proper interval by the above-mentioned British 
consul. 

Mr. Crawford's posthumous story, " The White 
Sister," belongs to the Roman group of his novels, 
and a Saracinesca is among the lesser figures. It is 
the story of a young woman, reared in the most 
conservative and clerical circles, and supposed to be 
the daughter of Prince Chiaromonte. The sudden 
death of the latter reveals the fact that Angela is 
without legal rights, and that, instead of inheriting 
title and fortune, she is a nameless pauper. She is 
affianced to an officer who is too much a gentleman 
to be influenced by this revelation, save to the dis- 
play of greater tenderness and determination to 
make her his bride. But his departure upon a mil- 
itary expedition to Africa is soon followed by the 
report of his death in a skirmish, and there is noth- 
ing left for Angela but to take the veil. She has 
been for some time a nun when it transpires that her 
lover was not slain, but has been held in captivity 
for several years. When he makes his escape and 
returns, a difficult situation is created ; for Angela 
cannot forget her love, yet is irrevocably vowed to 
the religious life. But it seems that there is a way 
out of even so desperate a difficulty as this, and a 
way that approves itself to so good a Catholic as 
Mr. Crawford. There seems to us a touch of casu- 
istry in the reasoning, but the author speaks by the 
card, and it is certainly a relief to our feelings to learn 
that the highest ecclesiastical authority is willing to 
intervene for the purpose of bringing the lovers 
together. 

Mr. Ernest Oldmeadow's " Antonio " presents a 
similar case of conflict between religious obligation 
and earthly love, but with a different issue, and with 
a degree of psychological power far beyond anything 
that was ever in Mr. Crawford's reach. This is a 
story of Portugal, dated from 1835 onward. It is 
the time of the suppression of the monasteries by a 
corrupt and unscrupulous government, and the in- 
terest centres around a Benedictine abbey overlook- 
ing the Atlantic. Antonio has just been made a 
priest when the news of the spoliation is received, 
and a band of soldiers comes to the abbey gates to 
enforce the decree of dispossession. Sadly and sol- 
emnly the abbey folk file forth into a world suddenly 
grown hostile, and seek new retreats in distant lands, 
Antonio alone remaining in the neighborhood. He 
has taken a great resolve ; he has determined to 
devote his life to reclaiming the abbey for the ser- 
vice of God and to restoring its ancient glories. The 
remainder of the book tells how this purpose is ful- 
filled after many years of toil and trial. Beginning 
in the humblest way, and keeping his secret close, 
he gradually acquires land and becomes a vine- 
grower. Slowly but steadily his enterprise prospers, 
and, despite many privations and heartbreaking 



182

disappointments, he sees the goal a little nearer with 
every year. The great trial of his constancy conies 
when the abbey is bought by an Englishman who 
brings his household to live there for a time. The 
new owner has a daughter, and Antonio engages in 
a desperate spiritual conflict to prevent his love for 
her from breaking down his resolution. In the 
event soul triumphs over sense, the work of redemp- 
tion goes on, the abbey is reclaimed for its sacred 
purpose, and the woman, chastened by years of grief 
and renunciation, becomes a Sister of the Visitation. 
It all stands in striking contrast to Mr. Crawford's 
story, which is seen to be the veriest brummagem 
when brought into comparison with the pure gold of 
this study of the spiritual life. The above is but a 
brief and barren outline of one of the most masterly 
and moving books of fiction that are often to be met 
with. It is a book of the deepest human interest, 
glowing in color and rich in emotion. Its scene, 
moreover, lies so far from the beaten track that a 
distinct element of novelty is thereby added to its 
other and nobler qualities. 

A variant upon the case of Hamlet is offered by 
Mr. Warwick Deeping's " Mad Barbara." This is 
a novel of the later years of the Restoration, when 
Popish plots haunted the minds of Englishmen, and 
the fussy Mr. Samuel Pepys kept the diary which 
has been the delight of all succeeding generations. 
We mention both these subjects because both are 
woven into the fabric of Mr. Deeping's narrative ; 
the worthy Mr. Pepys figures in several scenes, and 
the undoing of the villain results from his implica- 
tion in a Catholic conspiracy. Aside from these 
historical trappings, the story is simply good melo- 
drama. Barbara's father is slain mysteriously, and 
the daughter vows vengeance upon his murderer. 
Her only clew is a fragment of gold and pearl orna- 
ment which she finds on the spot where the body of 
her father is discovered. This she treasures, and 
bides her time. But when she thinks she has found 
the man from whose garment the ornament had been 
torn, he is no other than the returned soldier of for- 
tune to whom she has already given her heart in 
secret. Nevertheless, she would have taken his life 
had she not learned just in time that the garment 
belonged to his father, whose guilty liaison with her 
mother had made him the murderer. After an un- 
successful attempt upon the life of the real offender, 
she is confined, on the pretext of madness, in a lonely 
castle, whence she is rescued by her lover under 
circumstances of great peril. This is evidently the 
material for an exciting tale, and the author has used 
it to excellent effect. 

A melodramatic tale of conspiracy and freeboot- 
ing, of plot and counterplot in South Africa, is given 
us in Mr. Ridgwell Cullum's " The Compact." The 
scene is Bechuanaland, and the time is set in the 
years following the British concession at Majuba. 
The fate of the country hangs in the balance, for the 
British government has not formally claimed it, and 
is supine in the protection of its settlers, while 
German influences are secretly at work to gain con- 



trol. This is the historical setting of a drama which 
has three leading characters : Elwood, the strong 
silent man who thwarts the conspirators, Chalmer, 
their agent and ally, and the woman whom both men 
had loved in England. She had been pledged to 
Chalmer, who had gone to Africa, and sent no word 
thereafter. Believing him dead, she had married 
Elwood without loving him, and come to live with 
him in Bechuanaland. She is startled when Chalmer 
appears upon the scene, and renews his suit, but she 
has come to love her husband at last, and has only 
scorn for the man who had once had a claim upon 
her. If Elwood could have known this, there would 
have been no story to write, still less a compact to 
give it a title. For this compact, forced upon 
Chalmer by Elwood, is, in brief, that in a year's 
time the one of them whom the woman does not love 
shall put himself out of the way. As the time of 
fulfilment draws near, the situation grows tense with 
excitement, and the discovery of their reciprocal 
love, made by husband and wife at the last moment, 
is delayed until we stand upon the very brink of a 
tragedy. Then, by an ingenious device, Chalmer 
meets his deserved fate without entailing a moral 
responsibility upon either husband or wife. 

The preacher of high ideals, caring little for the 
dogmatism of the Christian church but filled to over- 
flowing with its spirit, set down in the midst of a 
sodden community (preferably rural), and slowly 
leavening the lump of its corruption by his clear- 
eyed activity, — this is a theme that has engaged the 
attention of many novelists (mostly women), and 
often lends itself to effective dramatic treatment. 
The preacher is usually a young man, and his strug- 
gle against the spiritual sluggishness, if not the 
actual immorality, of the town in which he is settled 
proves despairingly difficult. The details of his life 
are criticised by scandal-mongers ; he goes in for 
social betterment, and is told that he had better 
preach "the simple gospel "; he exposes the fester of 
hypocrisy, and becomes the victim of abuse and ma- 
licious intrigue ; he runs afoul of the local magnate 
and braves his wrath, but finds his position endan- 
gered ; in the end he conquers all the forces of 
sullen opposition, and reaps the fruit of his weary 
labors in the secure affection of a quickened and 
regenerated community. We have followed this 
programme through the pages of many novels, and 
we follow it once more in " But Still a Man," for 
which Miss Margaret L. Knapp is responsible. The 
story is unfolded with quiet impressiveness, never 
resorting to sensational trickery, and having few 
moments of dramatic tension. But it gains a strong 
hold upon us by its naturalness, its earnestness, its 
variety of character and incident, its gleams of 
poetry and humor, and its clear, unaffected style. 
The development of the minister's own character is 
not the least admirable feature of the novel, and his 
love affairs (when we have once got our bearings) 
add noticeably to the interest which we take in his 
activities. The scene is not too definitely fixed : it 
seems to lie somewhere in the Western Reserve.

THE DIAL 



183 






The collapse of the great bridge at Quebec pro- 
vides a striking climax for Miss Anna Chapin Ray's 
story of " The Bridge Builders." This tragedy of 
engineering is not used as a mere picturesque adjunct 
to the story, but is brought into vital relation with 
the characters concerned, and described with a 
wealth of technical detail that is rather surprising 
when we consider the sex of the author. The social 
setting is in part provided by the tourist hotels of 
the ancient city, and in part by the inner circle of 
the aristocratic life of Quebec. The heroine is a 
refreshing apparition from Arizona, and there are 
two heroes — one, a young man of letters from the 
States, the other an older man who is the scion of 
one of the most distinguished families of the city. 
Both men are of such fine types that our satisfaction 
in the success of the one is considerably embittered 
by our share in the other's disappointment The 
characterization of these three persons, and of at 
least half a dozen lesser figures, is distinctly success- 
ful, and the simple plot of the narrative is kept well 
in hand and firmly guided to its logical outcome. 
The style is admirable, the product of good taste and 
a cultivated mind, and the book is written from 
intimate knowledge of the scenes and social condi- 
tions which it portrays. It is the sort of book that 
may be read with much quiet satisfaction. 

Miss Susan Glaspell is a new writer, and one from 
whom much may be expected, if it is legitimate to 
base such a judgment upon a first book. The belief 
that love sanctifies suffering, and may make the 
blackest of tragedies seem bearable, finds poignant 
expression in "The Glory of the Conquered." The 
man is a biologist of world-wide fame, whose re- 
searches are directed toward the discovery of an 
effective treatment for cancer. The woman is an 
artist with whom promise is well on the way to fulfil- 
ment. Both are intense natures, and when they love 
it is with all the intensity that has hitherto been dis- 
played in their devotion to science and art. A short 
term of unreasonably happy wedded life is vouch- 
safed them, and then the tragic fates take a hand. 
In the course of a laboratory experiment, the man's 
eyes become infected, and his sight is destroyed. 
After the first shock of the castrophe has been out- 
lived, the woman forms a great resolve. She will 
abandon art, and devote herself to science, not to 
become herself an investigator, but merely to acquire 
the technical knowledge and expertness that shall 
enable her to provide the eyes for her husband's 
interrupted work and make it possible for him to go 
on with it. All this she plans and performs in secret, 
and is just ready to announce her preparedness to 
take up his work, when he dies from an attack of 
appendicitis. It will be seen that nothing is spared 
our feelings in this narrative, and nothing but the 
richness and tenderness of the author's sympathies 
makes it tolerable. Even in the outcome, the shat- 
tered life of the woman is somehow pieced together, 
and a hopeful chord is sounded at the close. A sort 
of moral victory is wrought out of what seems to be 
utter defeat, and the lesson of the soul's invincibility 



is triumphantly enforced. The scene of this moving 
story is set in and about the University of Chicago, 
but nothing is attempted of the nature of personal 
portraiture. 

A sweet and wholesome tale of life in New 
England in the years of the Civil War and after is 
given us in " Poppea of the Post Office," by Mrs. 
Mabel Osgood Wright. The heroine is a foundling 
child, left at the door of the village postmaster one 
stormy night. Widowed some ten years earlier, and 
bereft of his own child, he welcomes the stranger 
infant as a gift of providence, and makes her legally 
his own. It is a fortunate act, for she grows up into 
a winsome girl, and becomes the joy of his life. The 
mystery of her parentage is not disclosed until near 
the end of the book, when it transpires that she is 
the legitimate daughter of the local magnate, born 
after his wife, outraged by his conduct toward her, 
has left him and gone abroad to die. It is a simple 
story, and one that has frequently been told, but this 
present version need not suffer in the comparison 
with others, for it is appealing in sentiment and 
unfailing in charm. Nor is it without the diversifi- 
cations of humor, of a vivid portrayal of provincial 
customs and modes of speech, and of relationship to 
the larger life of the nation in the period dominated 
by impressions and memories of the great struggle 
for the preservation of the Union. Its love story is 
no less charming than all the rest, and is exquisitely 
fitted into the general complication. Mrs. Wright 
is to be heartily congratulated upon her excursion 
into the paths of story-telling. 

Miss Lottie Blair Parker's " Homespun " is one of 
those rambling stories that are much more concerned 
with racy characterization than with the development 
of a coherent plot. It gives us an intimate picture 
of the life of a New England town — Columbia 
Corners — with its individualized types, its gossip and 
scandal-mongering, its petty local issues, and its 
quaint vernacular. There is a great deal of homely 
human nature in the book, and an unfailing fund of 
humor. The plot, as far as there is one, centres 
about a protracted lawsuit between two brothers con- 
cerning the partition of the farm left them by their 
father. The younger generation is chiefly repre- 
sented by two lads, a petted " model " youth who is 
in reality a thoroughgoing hypocrite and rascal, and 
a youth of a very different sort who is thrown upon 
his own resources and " makes good " both with the 
world and with the young woman who stands by him 
in spite of all evil report. The story is pleasantly 
sentimental and entertaining throughout. 

Is character determined by heredity or by environ- 
ment ? This is the problem set in '• The Whips of 
Time," by Miss Arabella Kenealy, and illustrated by 
an ingeniously contrived and striking instance. An 
unscrupulous physician exchanges the infant children 
of two of his patients in a London hospital. One of 
them is the child of a notorious criminal ; the other 
belongs to a highly respectable family. In perform- 
ing this shocking experiment, the physician is actu- 
ated by the desire to refute the claim that a child of 



184 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



criminal antecedents will dev elope in accordance with 
its inherited predispositions. He confides his secret 
to a fellow-physician, who is duly horrified, but keeps 
silent about it because the wrong has been irremedi- 
ably done. This is the prologue of a story which 
really begins more than twenty years later. The 
confidant, now retired from practice, takes up his 
residence in the country, and finds himself in the 
very place where the criminal's child who has been 
foisted upon an unsuspecting family should now be 
living. He determines to identify the child and learn 
how the experiment has turned out. For a long time 
his suspicions are fixed upon the wrong person, and 
he does not discover his mistake until after a long 
and complicated development of the plot. When the 
mystery is cleared up, both of the exchanged chil- 
dren are found living in the neighborhood, and the 
controlling influence of heredity is demonstrated 
beyond any question. The story is not a pleasant 
one, but its mechanism is skilfully put together, and 
it is made the vehicle of a strong human interest. 

When a novel is heralded as the " prize mystery 
story" of a newspaper competition, we do not expect 
much from it beyond artificiality and excitement. 
" Love's Privilege," by Miss Stella M. During, is 
such a tale and has the qualities demanded by the 
conditions of such a competition. It has also an 
unexpected element of literary excellence, showing 
that style and mystery are not altogether incompat- 
ible in such a production. The scene of the story is 
an English country estate ; its substance is a murder 
which proves properly baffling until some three hun- 
dred pages have been devoted to its complications, 
when it all becomes absurdly simple. On the whole, 
the book provides entertainment of a slightly higher 
quality than the motive for its writing would lead 
us to anticipate. 

Napoleon's attempted invasion of England has 
always been a tempting theme for the romantic 
novelist, and Mrs. R. S. Garnett's "The Infamous 
John Friend " is at least the third book to deal with 
it during the past year. It is also one of the best 
of the many treatments that have been given to the 
subject, exhibiting a close acquaintance with the 
social and political conditions of the period, and 
developing a fairly original plot in a thoroughly 
interesting manner. It offers us the novelty of a 
hero who is utterly unscrupulous, a spy and a traitor, 
plotting to deliver his country to the enemy, yet is 
a devoted husband, a sympathetic figure in many 
other relations as well, and in some respects a high- 
minded gentleman. When he receives his deserts 
in the end our emotion gets the better of our logic, 
and we cannot become quite reconciled to the igno- 
minious execution of a man of such heroic quality 
and personal charm. The question may be raised 
as to the right of a novelist thus to set sentiment at 
odds with the requirements of justice, but that does 
not save our feelings from being harrowed in this 
particular instance. Several historical figures — 
Napoleon, Pitt, Fox, and Mrs. Fitzherbert — appear 
in the course of the narrative ; and there is much 



vivid description of society in London and Brighton, 
of smugglers' haunts on the coast of Kent, and of 
the doings of French spies. There is also a charm- 
ing and spirited heroine, worshipped with all proper 
humility, and eventually won, by a not very satis- 
factory hero. William Morton Payne.

From the author of " The Romance 

A great inventor x f g t j „ d „ Th ^ f the 

his life and work. 

Reaper there now comes another 
book of the same industrial-romantic character, 
entitled "Cyrus Hall McCormick: His Life and 
Work" (McClurg). Mr. Herbert N. Casson has 
here not only expanded the McCormick chapter of 
his earlier work on the Reaper, but he has also dili- 
gently collected and very attractively presented 
much historical and statistical matter concerning the 
development of agricultural implements and the 
recent rapid increase in the world's wheat production, 
an increase made possible largely by McCormick's 
inventive genius helped on by his imitators and 
competitors. So important, indeed, is wheat made 
to appear in the world's history that one is almost 
persuaded that a nation's consumption of white 
bread is an accurate gauge of its civilization. The 
life and personality of the great inventor are ade- 
quately set forth, with many interesting details of 
his services to his chosen city, Chicago, and his 
benefactions to religious and other enterprises, of 
which the founding and upbuilding of McCormick 
Theological Seminary and of " The Interior " news- 
paper are well-known examples. The author makes 
an occasional error of fact — as when, in his excel- 
lent survey of early nineteenth-century industrial 
and mechanical achievements, he speaks of Fulton 
as having " died at forty, plagued and plundered by 
imitators," whereas the inventor of the steamboat 
lived to the age of fifty and was commercially not 
unsuccessful in his main undertakings. Appropriate 
illustrations are provided for the book, depicting the 
great inventor, scenes in his life, the Reaper in suc- 
cessive stages of development, and views of harvest- 
ing, primitive and scientific, in various parts of the 
world. The word Reaper always begins with a 
capital in Mr. Casson's chapters, as it does in this 
notice ; and the reader must admit that the machine 
itself is an invention of capital importance, and its 
story one of unusual interest.

gifted man, with the aid of letters and other unpub-

lished material now first collected and scrutinized 
for biographical purposes. M Robert Fulton and the 
'Clermont'" is the book's title (Century Co.), and 
the story is adequately told in some three hundred 
small pages of large print, with many illustrations 
of novel interest and considerable appended matter. 
While chief prominence is given to Fulton's Hudson 
River achievements, many less-known particulars of 
his life and work are detailed ; for example, his 
early steamboat essay on the Seine several years 
before the Hudson River demonstration, and his 
numerous other inventions besides the steamboat — 
a marble-cutting machine, a flax-spinning machine, 
a double inclined plane for canal use. a contrivance 
for twisting rope, an earth-scoop, a cable-cutter, the 
panorama, the submarine torpedo boat, and a number 
of other less important devices. In reading the 
earlier portions of this interesting work, one is not 
surprised to find that Fulton was a high-spirited and 
forever restless boy, with more of vital energy and 
uncontrollable impulse than could well find vent. 
This fine "souvenir of the Hudson-Fulton celebra- 
tion." as the publishers call it, is timely, and fills a 
gap in American biography. A part of the material 
of Miss Sutcliffe's volume has appeared in "The 
Century Magazine," but it is well worth its produc- 
tion in this expanded and more permanent form. 

inside view* of The resignation of Marshal Mac- 
French politics Mahon as President of the Republic 
in the Republic. of France, on January 30, 1879, 
closed the series of victories of the French repub- 
licans over their monarchist adversaries — Legiti- 
mist, Orleanist, and Napoleonic. This incident falls 
about halfway in the period covered by the fourth 
and final volume of M. Hanotaux's " Contemporary 
France " ( Putnam). The dominant impression left 
by the narrative comes from the striking contrast 
between the aims of the political struggle that pre- 
ceded this event and the character of the movement 
that followed. The first concerned the very struc- 
ture of the central government; the second was es- 
sentially an effort to formulate and carry into effect 
a programme of genuine republican reorganization. 
The questions and the leaders of the first phase 
now seem to belong to a purely historical past ; while 
those of the second phase seem, and in some cases 
are, the questions and leaders of to-day, or at least 
of yesterday. We read of speeches by Brisson, by 
Freycinet, Ribot, Meline, and Clemencean ; while 
Broglie, Simon, and Laboulaye are heard rarely or 
have disappeared from the stage. The Ferry laws 
brought up the same problem of liberty of instruc- 
tion which the legislation of 1901 raised again. In 
explaining the arguments urged during the contro- 
versy, M. Hanotaux condemns Simon's appeal to the 
analogy of the liberty of the press as simple sophistry, 
because ''for the spoken doctrine in class instruction 
refutation and even discussion is impossible." And 
he adds that this question of liberty of instruction 
must be settled on the broader considerations of 
" prudence, tolerance, and humanity." It is apparent 



that he regards Gambetta's phrase, " clericalism is 
the enemy," as containing more truth than the 
ordinary electioneering cry. He seems to counte- 
nance the idea that if the elections of 1877 had 
favored the "conspirators" of the 16th of May, the 
clerical element would have dragged France into a 
war for the regstablishment of the temporal power 
of the papacy. As an ex-minister of foreign affairs, 
the author's treatment of all matters connected with 
diplomacy necessarily has unusual weight. Not only 
does this apply to the study of the clerical question, 
but to the chapters on the Russo-Turkish War and 
the Congress of Berlin. In preparing these the 
author has made large use of unpublished autobio- 
graphies, particularly the memoirs of Count Schou- 
waloff and the " Sovenirs " of Caratheodory Pacha. 
All the way through, the point of view is influenced 
by the recent dSnouement of the Balkan affair, the 
success of Austria backed by Germany in the defin- 
itive annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This 
is the reason why he believes that England in 1878, 
while supposedly opposing the Russian advance on 
Constantinople, was actually " pulling the chestnuts 
out of the fire " for the Germans. Bismarck looked 
on complacently while Salisbury and Beaconsfield 
did the hard work. The volume closes with the 
downfall of Gambetta's ministry and his death. 
Gambetta is evidently its hero; but M. Hanotaux 
feels his greatness more than he makes the reader 
feel it. This volume, like its predecessors, shows 
qualities of style which remind the reader that the 
author is a member of the Academy, but occasionally 
the habit of epigrammatic expression merges in a 
fondness for obscure Delphic utterances. 



TTie principles 
and practice 
of modern 
advertising. 



It was hardly supposed, a generation 
ago, that psychology and advertising 
had very much in common ; but now 
it is asserted by expert advertisers that much of their 
success is due to their knowledge of psychologic laws. 
This, we take it, is another way of stating that they 
must understand human nature and study the work- 
ings of the average human mind ; and in that sense 
it is quite true. This is preeminently the adver- 
tising age; and books on the subject are rapidly 
accumulating. In " The Art and Science of Adver- 
tising," by Mr. George French, bearing the imprint 
of French, Sherman & Co. of Boston, those interested 
will find an expert treatment of the subject from 
the pen of one practically familiar with the printing 
and advertising arts. That Mr. French by no means 
underrates the importance of his subject is evident 
from the outset " We know," he affirms, " that it 
[i. e. advertising] offers the most exalted opportunity, » 
the widest and most fertile field for human endeavor. 
We know that the advertiser is one of the greatest 
of popular educators, and one of the chief promoters 
of human happiness, as well as the greatest of busi- 
ness builders." Later he says : "It is easier to write 
an article for the Century Magazine than it is to 
write a fifty-word advertisement as it should be 
written." One almost expects him to assert, in his 



186

enthusiasm, that it is easier to be a great poet than a 
successful advertisement-writer; that Lawson is 
greater than Longfellow. The book's many re- 
productions of meritorious advertising designs are 
attractive and striking, but the author's repeated 
assertions of the vital elements in good advertising 
become somewhat wearisome. His style, like an 
effective advertisement, should be concise — although 
there are advertisers who rely on everlasting repeti- 
tion to sell their goods. The book represents much 
practical experience as well as study of its subject, 
and contains many helpful hints and suggestions for 
workers in this busy field of modern commercial life. 



A gay pageant Bio g ra P h y> like histor y> ma y be writ - 
of English scenes ten anew for each succeeding age 
and characters. an( j g am a f re shness and reality and 
meaning not to be found in the earlier records. This 
is well illustrated by Mr. Frank Frankfort Moore's 
volume of biographical studies entitled "A Georgian 
Pageant" (Dutton), and dealing with certain nota- 
bilities of the reign of George the Third. No less 
an authority than the late Professor J. Churton 
Collins stands sponsor to the book ; or, more exactly, 
its chapters are the outgrowth of certain conversa- 
tions with and encouraging words from that eminent 
scholar. It seems to have been largely to rectify 
sundry Boswellian perversions of truth that the 
writing of the book was undertaken. Especially 
zealous is the author in defending his illustrious 
fellow-countryman, Oliver Goldsmith, against Bos- 
well's charges of absurd vanity and petty jealousy 
and general inferiority. One is glad to believe with 
Mr. Moore that Goldsmith's humor was beyond the 
range of Boswell's comprehension, and that thus it 
was the Scotchman and not the Irishman who played 
the fool. But when we are further asked to believe 
that the so-called bull, a familiar Hibernicism, is in 
reality wit disguised as stupidity for the mystification 
of the slow-witted, we become incredulous. The 
incidents related in these agreeable chapters are set 
forth with the alluring art of which Mr. Moore, as 
a novelist, is so accomplished a master. Even where 
he is not convincing he is suggestive and original. 
The book is excellent reading and well illustrated. 

Recollections of Almost a quarter of a century ago 
sixty years of the two volumes of pleasing and success- 
Engiish stage. ful recollections, theatrical and mis- 
cellaneous, entitled " On and Off the Stage," came 
from the pens of Mr. and Mrs. Squire Bancroft (now 
Sir Squire and Lady Bancroft). Although the work 
ran through seven editions, it has been allowed to 
1 go out of print. Therefore a re-telling of their story, 
with additions to bring the whole up to date, is wel- 
come. u The Bancrofts : Recollections of Sixty 
Years " (Dutton) comprises in one substantial octavo 
volume the cream of the older work, and about the 
same quantity of equally rich skimming from the 
years since its publication. As managers of the old 
Prince of Wales's Theatre in London, and afterward 
of the Haymarket, as stanch supporters of the 



standard English drama, and as the first to dispense 
with the not too reputable " pit " and to devote the 
entire programme to a single play, these gifted and 
enterprising actor-managers, now resting on their 
laurels, have deserved well of the theatre-going 
public. Among other memorable matters, the book 
describes the turbulent dissatisfaction of the ground- 
lings when they found, on the opening of the re- 
modelled Haymarket, that their peculiar domain 
had been appropriated to the uses of a higher class 
of patrons. Of famous contemporary actors and 
actresses, and other persons of note, the writers have 
many an agreeable or amusing story to tell. For 
liveliness and variety, the book is one of the best of 
its kind. It is fully illustrated and indexed, and is 
well printed.

the middle West known in the world of music than in

some of his boyhood memories of prairie life in 
Illinois, of his first sight of the Mississippi at Alton, 
and of his later and longer sojourn in St. Louis — 
all in the eventful years from 1858 to 1863. "The 
Valley of Shadows " (Houghton) is the rather puz- 
zling title of the book, which is happily less gloomy 
and forbidding in its varied contents than in its 
name. Some of its quaint characters — as the silent 
Kezia Jordan, the rustic philosopher "Socrates," 
and Elihu Gest the " load-bearer" — are well drawn 
and move across the scene with a very human gait. 
Others are less substantially real, and the veil of 
imagination and weird romance thrown over them 
is never lifted. Despite the frequent conversations 
reported in detail, and other minute particulars, the 
reader is seldom gripped by a sense of startling 
reality, but sees all things through the subduing 
medium of a softly-tinted haze. That is the writer's 
art, however, and not to be quarrelled with. A 
chapter on Abraham Lincoln gives merely an ac- 
count, and not an unmistakably first-hand account, 
of the closing bout in the great Lincoln-Douglas 
debate of 1858, when the writer was but ten years 
old and probably not awake to the significance of 
the occasion. The book is attractively printed, and 
its short chapters have an inviting appearance. The 
fact of Mr. Grierson's foreign birth and rather cos- 
mopolitan course of life gives to these impressions 
of his a certain peculiar value and interest.

by the hand of man. In a lavishly illustrated vol- 
ume entitled "The Tower of London" (Jacobs), 
Mr. Charles G. Harper, who already has to his 
credit more than a score of books of historic and 
antiquarian interest, tells the story of this monument 
of kingly power and magnificence and cruelty and 
weakness. An introduction, giving a brief history 
of the building as a whole, is followed by chapters 
that present in detail a full account and description 
of its several parts, with abundant reference to noted 
prisoners once lodged within its walls, and to the 
famous crimes and conspiracies and rebellions that 
furnished occupants for its cells and dungeons. 
Some of the horrors of old-time torture and execu- 
tion are also revealed, while two chapters reproduce 
many elaborate stone-carvings to show how the 
weary captives sometimes beguiled the long hours 
by perpetuating their tragic memory or the memory 
of those dear to them. Recent removal of certain 
restrictions has opened the Tower more extensively 
and freely to visitors than ever before, and this latest 
guide-book to its many points of historic interest is 
timely and valuable. The evident care and study 
that have gone to its making place it on a high level 
among books of its class. 



Notes. 



Three new volumes in " Harper's Library of Living 
Thought " are the following : " Christianity and Islam," 
by Dr. C. H. Becker; « The Origin of the New Testa- 
ment," by Dr. William Wrede ; and " Jesus or Paul ? " 
by Dr. Arnold Meyer. 

The following new volumes are added to " CrowelTs 
Modern Language Series " : " Dornroschen," a playlet 
by Miss Emma Fisher; " One Thousand Common French 
Words," selected by Mr. R. de Blanchaud; and "Exer- 
cises in French Conversation and Composition," by Mr. 
Gustav Hein. 



A descriptive account, copiously illustrated, of the 
" Wild Flowers and Trees of Colorado," by Professor 
Francis Ramaley, is published at Boulder, Colorado, by 
Mr. A. A. Greenman. 

Messrs. P. Blakiston's Son & Co. have published a 
second revised edition of " A Text-Book of Physics," 
edited by Mr. A. Wilmer Duff. Each of the seven sec- 
tions of this thoroughly modern treatise is the work of 
separate specialists, the editor's contribution being the 
section upon mechanics and the properties of matter. 

The splendid work in the investigation of tropical 
diseases that has been carried on for several years in the 
Wellcome Research Laboratories, as a part of the work 
of the Gordon Memorial College at Khartoum, is 
freshly called to our notice by the third Report of that 
institution, now at hand. This handsome quarto of 
nearly five hundred pages, with hundreds of illustra- 
tions, many of them colored plates, is a monument to 
an enterprise of the highest import to human welfare, 
of interest not only to physicians, but to biologists, folk- 
lorists, and anthropologists as well. The Togo Publish- 
ing Co., New York, are the American agents for this 
and the preceding reports. 

The death of a biographer of English royalty comes 
to our notice in the recent decease of Sir Theodore 
Martin, who was born in Edinburgh ninety-three years 
ago. A lawyer by profession, but in his later life more 
occupied with literature, he produced an elaborate " Life 
of the Prince Consort " that won him a knighthood and 
also the warm regard of his Queen, whom he made 
the subject of a reminiscent volume entitled " Queen 
Victoria as I Knew Her," issued only last year. His 
essays in poetry and poetical translation, in literary 
criticism, and in other departments of letters, as well 
as his various activities of a different sort, have made 
him long a familiar figure in London life. 

Several new text-books of literature are ready for 
the school year now opening. " A Primer of American 
Literature " (Heath), by Miss Abby Willis Ho was, is a 
simple affair, a companion to the author's similar manual 
of English literature. A much more elaborate work, and 
one especially notable for the variety and interest of its 
illustrations, is the " English Literature " (Ginn) of Dr. 
William J. Long. Dr. Long's definition of a text-book 
is good: "A storehouse, in which one finds what he 
wants, and some good things beside." There is an 
unexpected freshness in his treatment, and his book is 
effectively planned. Bibliographical notes are appended 
to the several chapters, and provide many helpful hints. 

The appearance in England of a new and definitive 
edition of the works of Henry Seton Merriman will 
draw renewed attention to the writings of the brilliant 
author whose shrouded personality still remains un- 
veiled. The preface to the first volume, just issued 
by Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co., respects faithfully the 
deceased novelist's wish to speak to the public only in 
his books and under his pen-name. Not even the dates 
of birth and death are given, although it is now no 
secret that he was born about 1860, and was therefore 
in his early forties when he died in 1903. His real 
name too, Hugh Stowell Scott, is known to many. 
The first four of his published novels, and also the 
later, " Dross," are not to be included in this edition, 
being regarded by their author as of inferior quality; 
but these are obtainable, or accessible, in America. 
"The Slave of the Lamp" opens the series as repub- 
lished, and will be followed by a dozen (a baker's 
dozen, it appears) of the subsequent stories.

THE DIAJ, 



[Sept. 16, 



AXNOUSCEMBNT JLlST OF FALL, BOOKS. 



The classified list given below as the prospective 
output for the coming Fall and Winter season con- 
tains about 1400 titles, representing over forty lead- 
ing American publishing houses. These announce- 
ment lists, carefully prepared from the earliest and 
most authentic sources especially for our pages, have 
for many years been a special feature of The Dial ; 
and their usefulness and interest, to both the book 
trade and the book public, have long been recognized. 
They not only show at a glance what books are com- 
ing out in any department of literature, but form a 
complete summary of the principal publishing activ- 
ities of the year. All the books entered are new 
books — new editions not being included unless hav- 
ing new form or matter. Some of the more inter- 
esting features among these announcements are 
commented upon in the leading editorial in this 
number of The Dial. Considerations of space 
make it necessary to carry over to our next issue 
the categories of " Education " and " Books for the 
Young."

BIRDS OF THE BIBLE 



Author of " Freckles, 



By GENE STRATTON PORTER 

" The Song of the Cardinal," " What I Hate Done With Birds," etc. 



A Beautiful Book for a Gift A Charming Book for the Lover of Birds 

A Valuable Book for the Bible Student 

From Genesis to Revelation the Bible is filled with vivid 
word pictures of the out-of-doors. In all these the birds are 
prominent. Moses made laws about them ; Solomon, in his glory, 
sang of them ; Job, in his wisdom, discoursed on them ; the 
Prophets used them as illustrations, and Jesus himself frequently 
referred to them. 

It is around these passages that Mrs. Porter has built her 
book, viewing and interpreting them from the standpoint of both 
the trained naturalist and the Bible student and lover. She 
writes first of the Bible Times and the Place, then of the Birds 
of the Poets, and Birds of Abomination, followed by a chapter 
each on the Dove, the Eagle, the Sparrow, the Ostrich, the Cock 
and Hen, the Hawk, the Quail and Partridge, the Bittern, the 
Swallow, the Peacock, the Stork, the Raven, the Pelican, the 
Pigeon, the Crane, and the Owls. A unique book, and a most 
beautiful and valuable one as well. 

With eighty-odd remarkable bird photographs. 8<vo. ^6q

*•* This is this author's first venture in children's stories and a more delightful and genuine child's book would be hard to 

imagine. Written with that delicate appreciation of the child mind that only the master story-teller possesses, every page of the

unfolds with a wholesomeness often foreign in the fairy tale.

versatility that enables him to translate the author's meaning into delicate, fanciful, grotesque, or powerful illustrations that

Psychotherapy is the most discussed subject of the decade, and this book, reverent, conservative and scientific, will be

" The work is both interesting and valuable. The author keeps clear of the fanaticism that decries all use of material means 
of healing, while at the same time he maintains that the Christian religion is profitable for health as well as for other things. 
The study of faith healing from apostolic to modern times is exceedingly interesting and instructive."

This young Russian officer kept a diary throughout the blockade of Port Arthur and the voyage of 
Rojestvensky's fleet. From hour to hour he set down the rapid progress of events with a natural 
feeling for dramatic effect and a fervid patriotism which did not prevent, but rather increased, his 
sense of the mistakes and shortcomings of the Russian forces on land and sea. The book^is not 
only valuable historical material, but the most vivid, and probably the most accurate, accountjof the

List price, $1.35. Mailing price, $1.50. 

A direct, simple, and interesting account of the great English writers, their works, and the literary

The information is accurate, clearly arranged, and displays a broad and penetrating knowledge of the subject. 

No English text-book in literature, of equal size, can compare with this in wealth and character of 
illustrations. The frontispiece — The Canterbury Pilgrims — is a lithograph, in ten colors and gold, of a copy 
taken from a manuscript in the British Museum. 

The quotations, outlines, summaries, historical introductions, complete indexes, and a good working 
bibliography will be found of inestimable value to students. 

Long's English Literature is admirably put together, discriminating in its emphasis, sound in its judgments,

TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH 

With Frontispiece. $1.25 net. Postage, 12 cents. 

THIS Book is sent forth without the name of either author or translator. Some 
reason for this is set forth in the Preface, which at once whets the appetite 
for the narrative which follows. It is an intensely vital, self-revealing docu- 
ment — one in which the writer, like Rousseau or Amiel, seeks to tell the whole 
truth about himself, sparing nothing, condoning nothing. In an easy, smooth-flowing 
style, and through the medium of a story which at times grows highly dramatic, the 
man lays bare the secrets of his soul. "The whole man in his simplicity and 
earnestness appears in this book," says the translator. " But we shall let him speak 
for himself. He knows better how to do it, than we."

THE THEATRICAL UPLIFT. 

As the theatrical season opens, there is a bow 
of promise in the skies, arching from one shore 
of the Atlantic to the other, the sign of a new 
spirit in the direction of stage affairs in the 
English-speaking world. It is a sign only, and 
almost everything remains yet to be done, but 
never before have there been so many indica- 
tions that the English theatre is on the point of 
realizing its responsibilities, and of becoming 
the ally of education and art and morals. For 
a good many years a few idealists have been 
hammering at the nail of the endowed or sub- 
sidized stage, and it seems at last to have been 
driven in firmly enough to support our hopes, 
provided we are reasonably modest in their 
statement. The elementary propositions that 
the theatre may be made a worthy educational 
agency, and that, as such, it should no more be 
expected to pay its way than the college or the 
church, the public library or the art museum, 
appear to have been grasped by a number of 
minds sufficient to form a working- nucleus for 
the propaganda that has hitherto existed only 
on paper. The accretion of converts to this 
cause needs only to go on for a few years more 
at the present rate, and there will be enough 
serious theatres in actual operation to provide 
the skeptical with a convincing object-lesson. 
We have no idea that the theatre of commerce, 
devoted to the frivolities and vulgarities that 
best pay their exploiters, will be put out of 
business by the new development, for, as Goethe 
says, " Es muss doch solche Kauze geben," but 
we do foresee the time when in our larger cities 
it shall be possible to find some playhouse to go 
to for genuine spiritual refreshment. 

Looking first at the transatlantic aspect of 
the situation, we note that the war on the censor- 
ship goes merrily on, and that the doom or the 
radical transformation is in sight of a svstem 
that proscribes such dramatic masterpieces as 
" The Cenci " and " Monna Vanna," while tol- 
erating every form of debasing and brutalizing 
stage entertainment. Then there are the two 
new repertory theatres that are actually about 
to open their doors in London, one of them under 
the management of Mr. Herbert Trench, the 
other under the joint direction of Mr. Charles 
Frohman and Messrs. G. Bernard Shaw, Gran- 



220

[Oct. 1 



ville Barker, J. M.Barrie, and John Galsworthy. 
These two enterprises show that " the public 
within the public," to use Mr. Archer's phrase, 
has at last found practical recognition, and that 
the serious play-writer may be encouraged to 
engage in dramatic composition without keeping 
one eye squinted toward the box-office. There 
seems to be no reason to doubt the good faith of 
the men in charge of these new undertakings. 
Their official pronouncements may be illustrated 
by a few quotations. Mr. Frohman says : 

" A repertory theatre should be the first home of the 
young dramatist. I beg of him to be done with the the- 
atrical, and write only of a life that he really knows. . . . 
I want to interest the good play-goer, not once or twice 
a year, in what is being done at my theatres, but once 
or twice a mouth In my opinion there are now in this 
country a number of people sufficiently large to be called 
the public, who wish to delight in the drama as an art." 

These sayings have the right ring, and so have 
such utterances as these from Mr. Trench : 

" It is hoped that the new management will be able to 
give the most generous opportunities to young English 
dramatists. . . . Under our new system it will be possi- 
ble to produce masterpieces by dramatists of the first 
rank which would never see the light in a long run. The 
play of ideas will be varied also by selections from the 
best revived modern plays, and by classical plays." 

We are indebted for these " kernel " quota- 
tions to an article by Mr. Edward Garnett, 
whose own opinion is thus voiced : " The old 
view that the theatre is merely a place of amuse- 
ment is giving way, slowly, but none the less 
giving way, to the idea that the theatre is one of 
the most potent instruments we possess for the 
aesthetic, mental, and moral instruction of the 
citizen." This is a truism to anyone even super- 
ficially acquainted with the history of culture, 
but our English theatre has sunk to so low an 
estate during the last half -century that the state- 
ment will come to many with the force of a 
refreshing novelty. The vicious influences of 
the star system, the long run, the syndicated 
control, and the supine catering to low forms of 
taste, have so operated to bring the theatre into 
contempt that its repute will not easily be 
restored, even with the best of will and the most 
ample resources. But a fair beginning has been 
made, and our confidence now has something to 
which it may cling. 

Coincidently with these foreign undertak- 
ings, the New Theatre of New York is about to 
open its doors. Of the two factors necessary to 
the success of such a venture, money and intelli- 
gent direction, the former, at least, is not lacking, 
for the building and grounds are said to repre- 
sent an initial expenditure of three million 
dollars. As for the other factor, the names of 



those directly in charge, as well as the names of 
those who are supporting the enterprise, are of 
a nature to claim respect. Whether the danger 
that comes from a multitude of counsellors will 
be avoided remains to be seen. There is a cer- 
tain element of danger also in a too lavish 
material equipment, and it is possible that the 
financial path has been made too smooth. The 
directors disclaim any leanings toward precios- 
ity, and do not intend to frighten the public 
away by a too austere idealism. They do not 
aim to produce plays " too bright and good for 
human nature's daily food." The New Theatre 
is not, they say, "to be made a school for the 
select few, wherein a dull or tedious play of 
merit will be kept upon the stage for the pur- 
pose of instructing its patrons, but a playhouse 
for the public at large." They further say that 
they hope to make the institution " as distinctly 
democratic and civic as is the Comedie Fran- 
caise." This is all very sensible, and the early 
announcements indicate that various tastes are 
to be consulted. The first five plays to be 
given are " Antony and Cleopatra," " The 
School for Scandal," Mr. John Galsworthy's 
" Strife," and new works by two young Harvard 
graduates, Mr. Edward Knoblauch, who wrote 
" The Shulamite," and Mr. Edward Sheldon, 
who wrote " Salvation Nell." One evening a 
week is to be given to the performance of 
standard operas of the lighter sort. An import- 
ant point is that the company, which includes 
many actors of assured reputation, will visit 
other large cities for short engagements after 
the twenty-four weeks' season in New York is 
at an end. This gives the enterprise a truly 
national significance. 

Finally, a word should be said about the pro- 
gramme of Mr. Donald Robertson and his 
Chicago company of players. This modest organ- 
ization, inspired by a director whose aims are the 
highest and whose devotion to his art is abso- 
lutely pure and disinterested, has already done 
two years of successful missionary work, and now 
enters upon a third with high hopes and fair 
promise. The Chicago season will consist of 
thirty Saturday night performances, beginning 
early this month. They will be given upon the 
stage of Fullerton Hall at the Art Institute, 
with better facilities than were available there 
last year. The other days of the week will be 
spent in outside engagements, and the object- 
lesson will be repeated in many distant commu- 
nities. Mr. Robertson has projected, as before, 
a cosmopolitan programme of singular interest. 
His English classics are to be Sheridan's " The

Critic," Browning's "The Return of the Druses," 
Shelley's " The Cenci," and Shakespeare's 
" Timon of Athens." The two latter plays are 
practically unknown to the modern stage, and 
Shelley's great tragedy, forbidden in the poet's 
native country by the censor, has had only the 
single (private) performance given it by the 
Shelley Society about fifteen years ago. The 
first American performance will be distinctly an 
event. Ten continental dramas, new and old, 
are included in this fascinating programme. The 
classics are Calderon's " Mayor of Zalamaya," 
Moliere's " Tartufe," Marivaux's " Le Jeu de 
1' Amour et du Hasard," and Alfieri's " Saul." 
The modern examples are Echegaray's " The 
Stigma," Sudermann's " Gliick im Winkel," 
Heijerman's " Links," van Eeden's " Ysbrand," 
Ibsen's u H aermaendene paa Helgeland," and 
Bjornson's u De Nygifte," the earliest of his 
social studies. This extraordinary list of mas- 
terpieces will afford a hitherto unexampled 
opportunity for acquaintance with the best in 
dramatic literature ; that all these works are 
presently to be seen in actual stage performance 
in the English language is a fact that seems too 
good to be true. 



ON TEACHING LITERATURE. 



All sciences and special branches of knowledge 
can be taught, because they are limited in their 
nature and have definite rules and methods ; but to 
teach literature is a good deal like trying to teach 
life itself. One can only know life by instinct and 
experience. A class in literature must be a good 
deal like an aviary in which someone is endeavoring 
to introduce order and discipline. The birds' minds 
are so various, the air-paths and the perches are so 
numerous and alluring, that the drill-master can 
hardly help having a hard time. The converse of 
the rule about toadstools and mushrooms is true of 
students : if books bore or poison you, you are not 
a reader ; if you can digest them, you are. The born 
reader, even with the slightest learning, has an 
almost infallible instinct. He or she will never make 
the mistake of Charles Lamb's Stamp Collector, who 
asked him if he did not think Milton was a great 
poet. He or she will never exasperate you by sug- 
gesting that the last novelist has put the world's 
literature into eclipse. 

But the born diviners are few, and the majority 
of students need guidance and are willing to accept 
it. If it ever fell to my lot to conduct a class in 
literature. I think I should begin by placing in every 
pupil's hands a copy of Leigh Hunt's little compila- 
tion, u Imagination and Fancy." The Introduction 
to this work is of no great value, — or, at least, the 
ideas in it can be better gathered from their originals 



in Coleridge. But the selections form a small body 
of the most intensely poetical pieces and passages in 
the language. And Hunt, by his system of italiciz- 
ing the most perfect phrases and expressions, by 
his notes of ungrudging admiration, is continually 
at the student's elbow, to explain, illumine, make 
vivid, the wonders of the text. It would be a poor 
pupil who, from the study of such a work, would 
not come to realize that literature is a fine art — 
that its medium is words, and that these words are 
capable of melodies, harmonies, tints, colors, tone, 
and sculptural outline in infinite and almost ineffa- 
ble combination. The power of rendering by lan- 
guage the exact qualities of things, of giving in 
essential extract the forms and hues of life and 
nature, and of hinting at the interrelation and spir- 
itual significance of these matters, is the primary 
concern of literature. With some poets and prose 
writers, expression is all in all ; and with many 
readers it is so fascinating that they care for noth- 
ing else. 

From these studies in the near and the minute, I 
should jump my students at once to the considera- 
tion of the large and the remote. I should place 
before them, using English translations or recensions, 
the great early epics of earth's different races — the 
Icelandic sagas, the Niebelungenlied, the Celtic 
legends, and the great Hindoo epics. These works 
differ greatly in their qualities of expression, in their 
verbal felicity. The Niebelungenlied, perhaps the 
largest canvas of human action ever painted, is done 
in a rambling, garrulous style, in a jog-trot metre. 
The Icelandic sagas are terse and vivid, but they are 
travellers' tales, having little ordered art, and being 
the germs of poems rather than full poetic works. 
The Irish and Welsh legends have had an immense 
amount of art spent upon them in their varied recen- 
sions, and they are often splendidly beautiful in 
detail ; but in them the genius of the race has 
seemed to lack balance and measure. The same 
thing may be said of the Hindoo epics. But all of 
these works have in common greatness of design and 
creative fire ; and it is as necessary that the student 
of literature should get it into his head that these 
qualities are admirable as that he should learn to 
appreciate perfect form. They one and all shadow 
forth a world that is based indeed on our world, but 
rises above this like a mirage. They project figures 
that bear the semblance of humanity, but are larger, 
more tremendous, more significant than merely 
human characters. They involve the cosmogonies — 
the hopes and fears, the thoughts and intuitions, 
of mankind in its freshest stage of imagination. It 
is certainly a great gain to any student's vivacity 
and richness of mind when he can be interested in 
the Hindoo Lucifer, Ravana, who stood for ten thou- 
sand years on his bead (he had three of them, so he 
may have varied the exercise ), and thereby acquired 
so much merit that the gods could not prevail against 
him ; or when he can understand and take seriously 
the story of Thor nearly emptying the ocean by three 
draughts of a drinking-horn ; or when he can accept 



222 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Cuchulain's single-handed fight against an immense 
army. Such creations, while they are projections 
of single characters, have the concentrated signifi- 
cance of types. They compare with the figures in 
modern novels, which are also pictures of humanity, 
as gold coins compare with hank notes. These may 
have the same face value, hut the notes soon become 
dirty and torn, and are discarded ; whereas the coins 
keep their lustre and edge and intrinsic value for 
centuries. 

After the lessons of form and the lessons of design 
had sunk into my pupils' minds, then, and not until 
then, I should put before them accepted master- 
pieces of literature in which creation and execution 
go hand in hand. It is unnecessary to enumerate 
them — and, indeed, for school purposes a small 
selection from any one of the three supreme poets, 
Homer, Dante, or Shakespeare — would be sufficient 
to indicate what literature can do at its best. In 
any one of Shakespeare's most perfect plays, for 
instance, what faculties, what qualities, what mira- 
cles of vision and execution, combine to produce the 
total effect ! No single gift is there, but a complex 
of powers which it would be a fascinating though 
perhaps not very useful study to unravel and separate. 

Absolute realization, transcendent power, — these 
are the main goals of literature. Speech, in its 
commonest use, is an ever-recurring miracle ; but as 
used by the great masters to rival the concrete, to 
realize the abstract, to fix fleeting nature and life, it 
is the wonder of wonders. And the creative power 
of design, which on the basis of nature and life builds 
the empires of the imagination, is even more god- 
like. 

Something analogous to this division of literature 
exists in painting. From the first, artists seem to 
have been separated into two opposed camps : those 
who could realize, render, paint ; and those who 
could draw, design, tell stories. The one body was 
mainly concerned with the rendering of planes, 
modified of course by tint and color ; the other was 
chiefly interested in expressing ideas by means of 
lines. The Greek paintings that have come down 
to us in vase decorations are of the latter class ; they 
have purity of line and tint, but they do not seek 
to reproduce nature, and they do illustrate legends 
and express ideas. The great Greek painters, how- 
ever, Zeuxis and Apelles, were, if we may trust the 
legends about them, Tenderers. They sought to 
imitate nature ; they painted what they saw. In 
more recent times, Angelo, Raphael, Tintoretto, 
Poussin, Reynolds, David, and a great part of the 
English school, were designers, illustrators. And 
on the other side, Titian, Rembrandt, Velasquez, 
nearly the whole Dutch school, and Gainsborough, 
were painters, reproducers of nature. Both kinds 
of art are legitimate, — they are equally important, 
but it is curious that those who can paint despise 
design, while those who can design rarely render 
with the felicity and perfection of the others. It is 
the difference between the sensuous and intellectual 
faculties of man. 



There is no such decisive separation of these 
faculties, no such war of armed camps, in literature 
as in painting. It is difficult to use words at all 
without conveying ideas or telling a story — without 
exhibiting some quality of design. Here and there 
a poet or a prose-writer has succeeded in striking out 
impressions of nature, or rapturous musical tones, to 
which it is difficult to attach a coherent meaning. 
Perhaps Coleridge's " Kubla Khan " and Poe's 
" Ulalume " are the supreme examples, in our liter- 
ature at least, of such scenic or atmospheric rendi- 
tions. They may signify anything or nothing. On 
the other hand, writers who have anything at all to 
say have usually been able to say it in more or less 
felicitous words. But the distinction remains between 
the two orders of minds ; it is symbolized in the two 
opposed pairs, Goethe and Schiller, Keats and 
Shelley. Some writers pass through all the phases 
of the two gifts. Shakespeare began life intoxicated 
by words and images. He yielded himself up as a 
pure medium for life to express itself — as a mirror 
to reflect all the hues and objects about him. Grad- 
ually the intellectual predominated, and at the top 
of his career he seems almost to have disdained the 
vehicle of language, and, like Velasquez at the last, 
" painted with the will alone." The same progres- 
sion is observable in Milton, from the sensuousness 
of his earlier poems to the severe outlines of the 
" Samson." 

But to return to my class of students whom I left 
hanging in the air. There are two more matters I 
should like to impress upon them : first, the import- 
ance of the individual, the personal, in writers or 
creative artists ; and, second, the universality or con- 
stant recurrence of the master-moods of mankind 
which seek expression in literature. The writer's 
personality constitutes his originality. It is what 
he adds to the common stock. It is what differen- 
tiates him from others. No two artists can have 
the same view of human life or nature ; no two are 
started with exactly the same impetus, or meet with 
the same resistance. As a result, their work, down 
to the very motion of their prose or verse, is different. 
Hereby it comes that we would recognize a scene of 
Shakespeare's or a passage of Milton's if we met 
them in the middle of the desert of Sahara. All 
art worth the name has this quality of uniqueness, 
of singularity. 

But on the other hand, as the main experiences of 
mankind are, after all, limited in number, are com- 
mon to all, it comes about that literature must repeat, 
reiterate, recast, the same matter. The joys, hopes, 
sorrows, fears, aspirations and despairs of men must 
reappear in new guise in every age's art. Hence the 
parallels, similarities, revivals and imitations in liter- 
ature. The same general conditions compel the same 
kind of work. The Athenian drama, rising out of 
the heroic period of the Greek race, based upon 
religion, patriotism, art-zeal, finds itself echoed in 
the great English and Spanish theatres. The courtly 
verse of the Augustan age is parallelled by that of 
the epochs of Louis XIV. and Queen Anne. The

moods and manners and fashions of men change 
indeed, bnt they change in circles, and they are 
always finding themselves back in the same spot. 

"When I had got my class in literature thus far, 
I should dismiss it, sure that the twist or bent of 
each member would carry him too far in some direc- 
tion, and that catholicity of judgment would be left 
only for those who did not need any instruction at all. 
Charles Leonard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The tribute to the memory of Dr. Johnson 
on the recent bicentennial of his birthday (Septem- 
ber 18), was no noisy demonstration, but an appro- 
priate recognition of his still-living influence in our 
life and thought. He is now very little read, it is 
true : but he has left a few phrases and maxims that 
promise to abide. " To point a moral or adorn a 
tale " falls glibly from the tongue of thousands who 
have never heard of "The Vanity of Human 
Wishes," and many an untoward happening is 
spoken of as eclipsing the gayety of nations, with no 
suspicion on the speaker's part that he is quoting 
Johnson's allusion to the death of Garrick. Of 
course it is his life and personality, as transmitted 
to posterity by the faithfulest of biographers, that 
we cherish ; and the influence of his character will 
long outlast his writings. The bicentennial cere- 
monies began at Litchfield, September 15, with the 
formal opening, by Lord Rosebery, of a Johnson 
memorial exhibition, followed on the next day by a 
lecture from Mr. Sidney Lee, and in due course by 
the Johnson anniversary supper and a special ser- 
vice in the cathedral. A more elaborate commemo- 
rative dinner in London is planned for October, 
when Mr. Thomas Seccombe, Prior of the Johnson 
Club, will act as toastniaster. An exhibition of 
Johnsoniana at the British Museum is also among 
the possibilities. In the publishing world, a bicen- 
tenary edition of Johnson's poems, with an intro- 
duction by Mr. William Watson, is promised by 
Mr. John Lane, who also brings out a tempting 
volume entitled " Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale," 
by Mr. A. M. Broadley, with hitherto unpublished 
letters from Goldsmith, Boswell. Dr. Burney and 
Fanny Burney, Mrs. Siddons, and others, and also 
Mrs. Thrale s journal (now first published) of her 
Welsh tour with Johnson in 1774. 

Caustic criticism of the English censor of 
plays has of late enjoyed free vent in connection 
with the sittings of the Parliamentary Commission 
appointed to consider the functions of that worthy 
guardian of stage morality. Mr. Bernard Shaw, 
leading the attack, pelts the unhappy Mr. Redford 
with characteristic epigrams. The censor seems to 
the author of u Man and Superman" to be a sort of 
anarchist: law is what one expects to get from a 
magistrate, but from the censor of plays one gets 



only the chaos of that official's mind. " The more 
the censorship is improved," is Mr. Shaw's lament, 
" the more it will stop the immoral play, which from 
my point of view is the only play worth writing. . . . 
I am a conscientiously immoral writer" — from 
which assertion it was later developed that by " im- 
moral " was meant nothing worse than u uncustom- 
ary." Mr. William Archer, another outspoken critic 
of the censorship, is reported as affirming that u the 
censor keeps serious drama down to the level of 
his own intelligence, and does not even pretend to 
keep the lighter drama up to the level of his own 
morality." Mr. Henry James assails the censor in 
a terrific example of his well-known involved syntax, 
and then calms down sufficiently to add, in plain 
language: " We rub our eyes, we writers, accustomed 
to freedom in all other walks, to think that the cause 
has still to be argued in England." Ought we to 
rejoice or to mourn that we have in America no offi- 
cial censor over whom to make merry and to wax 
epigrammatically sarcastic ? 

The vogue of the old-fashioned novel shows 
signs of revival. After an over-abundance of quick- 
lunch fiction, and the mental dyspepsia such hastily- 
gobbled fare is apt to produce, the leisurely many- 
course dinner — the orderly romance divided and 
subdivided into parts and books and chapters, and 
proceeding from proem to climax and from climax 
to conclusion with something of the unhasting slow- 
ness of life itself — is a welcome relief and a restful 
change. Not yet have we in this country or England 
reverted to the novel issued in monthly or quarterly 
parts, after the manner of Dickens's and Thackeray's 
longer stories ; but in France one of the literary 
successes of the past few years has been M. Romain 
Rolland's "Jean Christophe," now in its seventh 
volume and in the third year of its instalment pub- 
lication, with no sign of satiety on its readers' part. 
Long novels are not lacking in current English 
and American fiction, such as Mr. De Morgan's 
deliberately-moving tales and some of Mrs. Humphry 
Ward's and Mr. Churchill's books ; but our publishers 
are wary about issuing them in any but the single- 
volume form. The prevalent English views and ten- 
dencies in this matter are discussed very pertinently 
elsewhere in this issue by our London correspondent, 
Mr. Clement K. Shorter, whose letters are hereafter 
to form a regular feature of The Dial. 

Choosing books for a public library is 
pleasant work for the choosers, but their wisdom is 
sure to be sharply challenged if the library con- 
cerned is situated in any wide-awake and independent 
community. More difficult still is it to select books, 
not for any particular public library, but for the 
average or the typical or the ideal public library. 
The annual '• Best Books of the Year " issued by the 
New York State Library — the exact title of the 
current number is "A Selection from the Best Books 
of 1908" — illustrates the impossibility of suiting 
all tastes in what is partly at least a question of taste.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



A list of 250 of last year's books, marked in such 
wise as to indicate their several degrees of import- 
ance for the large, the medium, and the small public 
library, has been drawn up by the book board of the 
New York State Library. In any such list it is easy 
enough to point out noteworthy omissions and com- 
missions, so to speak. Messrs. Chesterton and Shaw 
are both coldly excluded. Mr. Frederic Harrison's 
" Realities and Ideals " receives no mention. Dr. 
W. Robertson Nicoll's "Ian Maclaren" fails to 
appear. Even Captain Amundsen's " Northwest 
Passage " is not deemed of sufficient importance to 
have a place in the list. Christina Rossetti's "Letters" 
and Dr. Schouler's " Ideals of the Republic " are 
also among the slighted. On the other hand, we have 
" The Cat and the Canary " and " Anne of Green 
Gables " — and so we will not yet despair of the 
republic. ... 

The usefulness of the newspaper beading- 
boom in libbabies is seriously questioned. Such 
a room is more than likely to be pretty well filled 
at all hours of the day and evening, especially the 
latter; but what class of readers are found there, 
and what lasting or even momentary good are they 
deriving from their attendance? A little mental 
and emotional titillation, perhaps, from the perusal 
of the reported crimes and casualties of the last 
twenty-four hours ; a little rest, in many cases, from 
the rigors of less comfortable loafing elsewhere ; a 
little slumber, it may be, as the head bows in ap- 
parent study over the capacious sheet ; and now and 
then a chance to chat surreptitiously, and to the 
greater or less annoyance of near neighbors, with 
an old crony. To better uses than these, no doubt, 
a few serious readers do put the room and its read- 
ing matter; but hear for a moment what has been 
the Brooklyn Public Library's experience after 
withdrawing or curtailing these newspaper privi- 
leges. " On account of the large increase in attend- 
ance in the Periodical and Newspaper Reading 
Room the Chief Librarian recommended to the 
Trustees that the daily papers be no longer placed 
on open file. This was carried into effect, and, to 
the surprise of many, there has been practically no 
complaint on the part of the public, but instead an 
expression of satisfaction at the change. There has 
been a noticeable increase in women readers." As 
a means of raising the standard of reading, and 
also of readers, this simple and economic move 
has its commendable aspect. 

The Globe Playhouse of Shakespeabe's 
London has long been a thing of history and tradi- 
tion only, and its site is now occupied by a brewery. 
On the 8th of this month a memorial tablet, to mark 
as nearly as possible the site of the old theatre, said 
to be the first built in London, will be unveiled by 
Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree. The Shakespeare 
Reading Society, of which the eminent actor is 
president, took the initiative in this matter eighteen 
months ago. Dr. William Martin, F.S.A., has 



designed the tablet, which shows in relief Bankside 
in Shakespeare's time, the Globe Playhouse occupy- 
ing a central position, with the Thames and London 
Bridge in the background, and a medallion bust of 
Shakespeare in one corner of the tablet. The inscrip- 
tion reads : u Here stood the Globe Playhouse of 
Shakespeare, 1598-1613. Commemorated by the 
Shakespeare Reading Society of London and by 
subscribers in the United Kingdom and India." 
Destroyed by fire in 1613, the theatre was rebuilt in 
1614, and it is this second structure that is com- 
monly associated with Shakespeare's name although 
he had nothing to do with it. The mural tablet will 
be affixed to the wall facing Park Street. 

The libbabian's complex duties are far re- 
moved, in their range and variety and increasing 
difficulty, from the old-time conception of them as 
consisting merely in the careful custody of a collec- 
tion of books, the occasional loan of a desired volume, 
and the checking of the record when it is returned. 
A single paragraph from the latest Brooklyn Public 
Library Report will convey a hint of what modern 
librarianship means. Of the branch libraries we 
read : " The area which each branch library is sup- 
posed to serve is being studied from a sociological 
point of view ; statistics of population, nationality, 
religion, wealth, congestion of population, public 
schools, labor unions, fraternal organizations, etc., 
are being compiled. Note is being made of classes 
of the community which the library does not reach ; 
of classes of literature in which the branch appears 
to be weak, or overstocked : of means that have been 
found efficacious in extending the influence of the 
library, and of plans that have not met with success." 
The Brooklyn Public Library, one of the largest and 
most active in the country, has now twenty-five 
branches, including the five new Carnegie buildings 
added last year, four stations, and one library for 
the blind, and four hundred and sixty-five travelling 
libraries. , . . 

A pbodigiously pbolific stoby-wbiteb for 
boys and, between whiles, for adults has laid down 
his busy pen forever. George Manville Fenn, who 
died recently in his seventy-ninth year, was a veri- 
table prodigy for fertility of imagination and literary 
productiveness. His stories for boys and novels for 
older readers numbered well over a hundred ; prob- 
ably he himself could not have told how many he 
had written. He also contributed more than a 
thousand short tales and sketches to the magazines. 
With George A. Henty, the boys' historical novelist, 
he shared the favor of the book-reading youngsters 
of his own country, and to a large extent of ours 
also. They had the confidence of parents as safe 
guides for their boys through the enchanted land of 
heroic adventure. And now that the two Georges are 
gone, who can fill their places with their sorrowing 
readers ? No one, of course ; but other favorites will 
arise for other generations, and the store of innocent 
enjoyment in wholesome and hearty juvenile fiction

will suffer no diminution. Mr. Fenn's literary 
activity nearly up to the time of his death, and his 
fondness for travel, for gardening, and for natural 
science, 6how him to have successfully resisted the 
benumbing tendencies of old age. 

A poet's romance that is just now attracting the 
attention of those who are fond of happily-ending 
love-stories comes to our notice from across the 
Atlantic. Mr. William "Watson, at the sufficiently 
mature age of fifty-one, has wedded Miss Adeline 
Maureen Pring, of Howth, County Dublin, praised 
for her beauty, and, let us hope, in all other respects 
the fit wife for a poet. Thus has the author of 
"The Year of Shame " given additional expression 
to his interest in and sympathy for Ireland — 

"... the lovely and the lonely Bride 
Whom we have wedded but have never won.*' 

It will be not unnatural to ask oneself whether the 
lines " To a Lady " — an Irish lady she manifestly 
is — that introduce the above-named volume of 
poems, published thirteen years ago, were not ad- 
dressed to her who has now become the poet's wife. 
A new sheaf of verse is said to have been delivered 
to his publisher by the happy bridegroom, as he 
hastened from London to join the wedding party. 
Early publication of the epithalamic volume is 
announced. 



FROM LITERARY LONDON. 
(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 

The whole book-trade of England has been very 
considerably agitated during the past three months 
by the question of the six-shilling novel and its 
future. It has long been insisted that for this 
country the sum of six shillings was too much to 
pay for a work of fiction that might be read in a few 
hours. It is true, of course, that not many years 
ago new novels were published here at five times 
the price, — that is to say, in three volumes for 
thirty-one shillings sixpence. That system of three 
volumes had much to be said for it : the full story 
of the rise and growth of the three-volume novel has 
never been told.* 

" Waverley," for example, the first great popular 
novel of the last century, was only in two volumes. 
Some of Sir Walter Scott's romances appeared 
in three volumes, and others in four volumes. 
Thackeray's "Vanity Fair," after it had been 
issued in parts, came out in one volume, although 
" Esmond " appeared in two. Dickens's novels, as 
we know, usually appeared in monthly parts. It 
was nearer our own day that the three-volume novel 
became an institution, and all book-collectors con- 
sider themselves happy if they possess certain of 
the novels of George Eliot , the Brontes, George 

*The story of its rise and growth, and of its fall, was told 
very entertainingly by Sir Walter Besant in The Dial for 
October 1, 18<M, under the caption "The Rise and the Fall 
of the ' Three-Decker." ' — Edr. The Dial. 



Meredith, and, more recently, of Mr. Thomas 
Hardy and Mr. Henry James, in the three-volume 
form of their first editions. But before its final ex- 
tinction, the three-volume novel, although it was 
delightful for reviewers on account of its large type, 
had become an encumbrance to the booksellers and 
a burden to the libraries. It survived, apparently, 
because the late Mr. Charles Edward Mudie, who 
ran the greatest circulating library in London, had 
entered into a compact with three publishers of many 
novels in their day. — Tinsley, Bentley, and Hurst 
& Blackett, — by which he undertook to subscribe 
for a certain number of the novels issued by these 
firms. This arrangement considerably handicapped 
many of the younger publishing houses; and it 
was Mr. Heinemann who gave a death-blow to the 
system, by the publication of a novel of Mr. Hall 
Caine's in the six-shilling form. 

Mr. Heinemann has been destined, in this present 
year, to lead yet another movement in the direction 
of change, with what final result it is not possible at 
present to speak with any certainty. A few months 
ago Mr. Heinemann, in a speech addressed to book- 
sellers, declared that it was obviously unfair that a 
novel of forty thousand words should be sold at 
the same price as a novel of one hundred thousand 
words. Therein he gave a hint of a scheme that he 
was about to put into practice. There is no doubt 
that the custom of producing novels of few words 
for the same price as long novels was having a 
demoralizing effect on the book-trade. The worst 
examples that I can recall are a story by Miss Olive 
Schreiner, and another by Mr. Maurice Hewlett 
This last, I may add, was issued as a six-shilling 
book in spite of a protest from the author. 

Mr. Heinemann, then, has launched his new 
scheme ; and again Mr. Hall Caine is the hero. His 
latest novel, " The White Prophet," which consists 
of one hundred thousand words, has been issued in 
two volumes for four shillings. Mr. Heinemann 
has followed this by two short novels, in single vol- 
umes, at two shillings each. In a few weeks we are 
to have, in the same series, Mr. William De Morgan's 
" It Never Can Happen Again," in two volumes, for 
six shillings net, — this being a story of two hun- 
dred thousand words or more. 

As our booksellers are to get six shillings net for 
Mr. De Morgan's book, instead of the four shillings 
sixpence for which they usually sell a six-shilling 
novel, Mr. Heinemann will do very well if he sells as 
many copies as under the old system. So far, this 
second attempt at a revolution has not succeeded with 
the purchasers of fiction. Mr. Hall Caine's novel 
" The White Prophet," is " hanging fire." As far as 
I can gather, thirty thousand copies were sold to the 
English market, and ten thousand to the colonies; 
but inquiries among booksellers make it clear to me 
that the public have not shown their usual alacrity 
in purchasing Mr. Hall Caine's book. This has been 
attributed in some quarters to a dislike of the two- 
volume form ; in others, to the many severe reviews 
which Mr. Caine's novel has provoked. I am more 



226 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



disposed to attribute it to the fact that the novel has 
appeared serially in the " Strand Magazine," and 
that Mr. Caine's readers are, in the main, readers of 
that excellent publication. However, Mr. Caine has 
congratulated himself on the fact that, after all, 
despite the critics — whom he calls " dead-heads " 
and " hangers-on " — he has sold more copies of his 
novel in the book-shops during this season than any 
other author. That does not seem a very remark- 
able fact, for no other author of any importance has 
published a novel in August or September. 

Mr. Caine's reference to " dead-heads " is doubt- 
less connected with the "review copy." Every 
London publisher has to give away at least a hun- 
dred copies of each of his novels, if he wants them 
to be widely reviewed. With other books he can 
keep the number down to sixty or eighty, and in 
some cases to forty ; but no publisher would dream 
of sending out less than a hundred copies of a novel 
to the multitudinous newspapers of London and the 
Provinces. 

Mr. Caine has always demanded from his pub- 
lisher a much more extended generosity than this. 
With one of his earlier books, he sent nine copies to 
a single newspaper. Every member of that journal 
received a present of one. Doubtless he intends to 
alter this in the future, and I should not be at all 
surprised if he takes the course that has long been 
adopted by Miss Marie Corelli, and refuses with his 
next novel to send any copies to the newspapers for 
review. Miss Corelli, however, always took care 
that one or two good reviews of her books should 
appear. I particularly recall that Lord Burnham 
received a copy, with a request for a notice in the 
" Daily Telegraph," and that the notice was forth- 
coming. At the present time, when Miss Corelli 
publishes a new novel several of the newspapers buy 
copies in order to furnish their readers with reviews. 
It may be admitted that Mr. Hall Caine is one of 
the fortunate writers who can do precisely what is 
done by Miss Corelli. Both novelists appeal to a 
huge non-literary class, and are not under the same 
conditions that guide the great majority of our 
authors struggling to obtain a public. Were pub- 
lishers to refuse to send books for review as a general 
practice, the authors — and particularly the male 
authors — would become frantically hysterical. 

I have referred to Mr. William De Morgan's 
new novel, " It Never Can Happen Again." Mr. 
De Morgan is a wonderful man, a little bit like the 
late Mr. George Meredith in appearance, with a 
kindly face and keen piercing eyes. He is a de- 
lightful talker, and enjoys the success which has 
come to him so late in life, — for he was sixty-seven 
years of age when his first novel, " Joseph Vance," 
appeared. He had b^en an artist in a particular kind 
of tile during the intervening years, and had led a 
life of much happiness, although, perhaps, not of 
too much prosperity, alternating between a studio 
in The Vale, Chelsea, opposite the home which Mr. 
Whistler once occupied, and Florence, where he 
wintered for his health year by year, until the day 



Mr. Heinemann published "Joseph Vance." The 
book, had only been submitted to one previous pub- 
lisher ; so even here he was fortunate. Each of his 
three novels, so far, have been great successes, in 
spite of their extraordinary length. Will the fourth 
novel be as successful in two volumes as the three 
others have been in one ? is the question. I hope so, 
on many grounds ; for I think Mr. Heinemann's 
two-volume form is very charming. 

Meanwhile it is worthy of notice that there are 
more six-shilling novels coming out this season than 
ever before. The Macmillans, the Methuens, all 
our leading publishers of fiction, are sending them 
out in large quantities. A number of new pub- 
lishers have come upon the scene, and these also are 
running the six-shilling novel. One firm, named 
Mills & Boon, has sent me a great many lately ; 
while another publisher, Mr. Andrew Melrose, has 
delighted me with one particular story, " The Wood- 
Carver of 'Lympus," by Mary E. Waller. 

Mr. J. M. Barrie and Mr. A. E. W. Mason have 
been spending some time together among the Swiss 
mountains at Zermatt. Whether or not this means 
collaboration in a new play, I cannot say. So far, 
Mr. Mason has not had any of Mr. Barrie's won- 
derful success as a playwright, although his novels 
have grown in popularity with the years. 

Three of our most popular novelists have just 
finished new stories. Mr. and Mrs. Egerton Castle 
are calling their next novel " The Panther's Cub," 
while Mr. Anthony Hope entitles his "The Second 
String." Mr. Anthony Hope has not, I think, been 
doing as good work lately as in the days when he 
published that fine romance " Rupert of Htmtzau," 
and that powerful piece of analysis, " Quisante." 
Let us hope that " The Second String " will be of 
the old quality. Clement K. Shorter.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



IN COMMENDATION OF A RECENT NOVEL. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

As far as I have been able to find opportunity to 
compare my own judgments of current literary produc- 
tions with those of The Dial, I have usually felt much 
comforted by a general correspondence. When I have 
had any disagreement, it has been that The Dial is 
inclined to generosity in its judgments. This, however, 
is not only agreeable to readers but safe for the critic, 
since it is far better that a contemporary should think 
too well of companions than that posterity should con- 
clude that one thought too ill of them. 

But in the last issue of The Dial I find an opinion 
of a recent novel that seems to me not only incorrect 
in the measure assigned according to scale but also 
unfair in the scale employed. To this novel, " A Cer- 
tain Rich Man," is accorded the first mention in a series 
of reviews. I read that novel carefully more than a 
month ago, and I have been reflecting upon it ever since. 

Your reviewer has seemed unable to get out of bis 
mind two facts, with which he chooses to handicap the 






1909.] 



THE DIAL

author. He insists upon remembering that William 
Allen White has written boys' stories, and therefore 
credits him with much success in treating the early life 
of the hero; and he insists upon remembering that Mr. 
White is also a publicist, deeply concerned with the 
modern trend in political and economic matters, and 
somewhat pessimistic in his utterances. In consequence, 
the reviewer seems to suggest that the novelist is juve- 
nile and even naive, sensational and even denunciatory, 
in his representation of the grown man. 

Let me confess that upon opening the novel I expected 
to find it as the reviewer says it is. I intended to read 
it in an evening. But I did not find it superficial or 
sensational, juvenile or narrow. I spent a week reading 
and re-reading it, and still think the time well employed. 

The great novelist sits like a justice in court, atten- 
tive, silent, in white ermine ; and he means to see things 
as they are. When, in his final deliverance, the novelist 
makes the reader feel that he would be glad to have 
such an eye see what is good in himself and such a 
voice tell it, but sorry to have him note and report 
what is evil, the novelist has succeeded, for he has con- 
vinced his reader. Such is the impression made upon 
myself by the author in this instance. No mere maga- 
zinist can do this, though the power to do it should not 
be a disqualification for magazine- writing! 

Probably if John Barclay is a caricature the novel 
will ultimately fail. In a general way, it reminds one 
of ■ Vanity Fair " and of " The Rise of Silas Lapham." 
It spreads a broad canvas and paints many figures upon 
that canvas; professional critics may say that it paints 
too many. But at the same time it does attempt to tell 
every phase of the process by which John Barclay, 
thinking that he rose, actually fell. 

It may be that many intimate relations with persons 
of great wealth — by blood and circumstance — have 
caused qualities in themselves and events in their affairs 
to seem natural to me that seem unnatural to persons 
who have not had this fate. Yet it is just at this point 
that I most heartily approve of the portraiture of the 
"certain rich man." The novelist does not fall into 
the demagoguery of asserting or even suggesting that 
John Barclay is the typical rich man. I can put my 
finger now upon men whose characters and careers have 
been notably h" e his. I have seen souls shrivel as his 
shrivelled. I have seen fortunes made in the same 
tricky, absurd, painful and yet proud way; and 1 have 
seen rich men with hobbies bike John's organ-playing, 
and in their senescence converted as he was. And yet 
I concede that if in a year or two public opinion in 
respect to this novel calls John improbable, then the 
novel may prove, like so many others, apparently ephe- 
meral. If so, it will be for two reasons: that the 
American reading public does not know some of its rich 
men, and fails to see how much larger is the novel than 
a simple life-story of one man. 

Even so, I believe that " A Certain Rich Man " will 
soon or late come to permanence for a great quality 
inadequately emphasized by your reviewer. There is 
a sweet purity in its women and in some of its men that 
is true to human nature at its best, the kind of human 
nature that of right belongs in novels. Whether we 
live in such fashion ourselves or not, we admire and love 
most of the lesser folks in this history. The Culpep- 
pers are not new, but they are charming. The mother 
of John Barclay has a Greek quality of aloofness and 
of supremacy. Unfortunately, few modern novelists 
care to present these beautiful and gracious characters. 



The reviewer suggests that there are some dull pages 
in this book. So they may be discovered in Hawthorne 
and in Shakespeare. There are traces of artificiality 
at times, but that is a fault to be shared with Thackeray 
and Dickens. One does sometimes hear a sound as of 
" pumping," and it is disagreeable. But George Eliot 
worked hard for some effects in ways that are still 
audible. " There is none perfect " is as true to-day as 
it was yesterday. Homer himself nods. 

It seems to me that the American reading public will 
take this book seriously and declare it one of the 
greatest novels of our soil. I hope so, for I believe 
that it will do good as a work of art, not merely as a 
disguised polemic. 

This is only one man's opinion, but I hold it strongly 
enough to write it out, and if need be to defend it.

EPISTOLARY PLAGIARISM. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

M. Alphonse Lefebvre, in nis volume " La Celebre 
Inconnue de Prosper Me"rime*e " (Paris, 1909), finds in 
the correspondence of the Inconnue, Mile. Jenny Daequin, 
some interesting evidences that the lady considered 
Me'rime'e's letters her own property to an extent that 
allowed her, as M. Faguet phrases it, to issue " quelques 
petites secondes editions." Thus, in a letter dated 
Jan. 22d, 1860, Me'riiue'e informs Mile. Daequin: 

"On m'a prete le pamphlet de men confrere Villemain, 
qui m'a paru d'une platitude extraordinaire. Qoand on a 
essay£ de f aire un livre centre les Jesuites, quand on s'est 
vante de defendre la liberty de conscience eontre l'omnipo- 
tence de l'Eglise, il est drole de venir chanter la palinodie et 
d'employer de si pauvres arguments. Je crois que tout le 
monde est devenu fou, excepts l'empereur, qui ressemble aux 
bergers du moyen age qui font danser les loups avec une flute 
magique." 

And on the 26th of January of the same year, Mile. 
Daequin writes to her nephew: 

" Je suis indign^e eontre M. Villemain. Quand on a essays 
de faire un livre eontre les Jesuites et qu'on s'est vant£ de 
defendre' la liberty de conscience, il est drole de chanter la 
palinodie at d'employer de si pauvres arguments. H n'y a 
que l'empereur qui soit logique. II ressemble aux bergers 
du moyen age qui font danser les loups avec une flute 
magique." 

Faguet and Lefebvre assure us that such transplanta- 
tions are numerous in the Daequin correspondence, and 
that there are still other passages which, in view of the 
fact that all of Me'rime'e's letters to the now well-known 
" Unknown " have not been published, are suspicious in 
that they (to quote Faguet again) " resseinblent a da 
Menmee." 

I have just come upon a reference to similar freedom 
of appropriation under strikingly similar circumstances. 
Wilhelm von Humboldt maintained for two years a 
Platonic correspondence with Charlotte Diede. Letter* 
of Madame Diede to relatives and friends have been 
preserved, and these letters, if we are to believe Albert 
Leitzmann, whose article, " Die Freundin Wilhelm von 
Humboldt's," appears in " Die Deutsche Rundschau " 
(Berlin) for August, contain clauses, sentences, and 
entire discussions, carried over bodily from Humboldt's 
letters to her. 

The temptation under such circumstances is naturally 
great, and similar instances are probablv numerous.

A Latter-Day English Naturalist.* 



For combined intensity and purity of pas- 
sion, Richard Jefferies has been compared with 
Shelley ; for originality in observation and 
expression, and for a certain wayward inde- 
pendence united with an unmistakably English 
quality of sentiment and opinion, he has been 
likened to George Borrow. But these compari- 
sons are of little help ; like all men of genius, 
Jefferies is unique, and to be understood he 
must be studied in Ins own books and in his 
recorded habits and pursuits. 

Such a study of him, more elaborate and 
sympathetic than has before been undertaken, 
has now been made by Mr. Edward Thomas in 
his " Richard Jefferies : His Life and Work," 
a substantial octavo, well illustrated, and pro- 
vided with a bibliography, a map, and an 
index. As a biography, and also a critical 
study, the book has merits which neither Sir 
Walter Besant's " Eulogy " nor Mr. Salt's 
excellent study of the naturalist possesses. In 
short, this new life of Jefferies is not super- 
fluous. 

There was oddity if not genius on both sides 
of the Jefferies family : the father is called " a 
funny-tempered man, full of unexpected likes 
and dislikes," and the mother is described as 
" generous, but irritable and queer." The elder 
Jefferies was fond of horticulture and floricul- 
ture, and was an adept in judging timber, 
whether felled or standing ; while his wife was 
noted for her excellent butter and cheese. It was 
on the small farm managed by this able couple, 
at Coate, parish of Chisledon, in Wiltshire, 
that John Richard Jefferies (who in manhood 
called himself simply Richard Jefferies) was 
born on the sixth of November, 1848. His 
schooling, at Swindon and elsewhere near home, 
was cut rather short by the necessity or the 
advisability of his earning his own living. At 
seventeen we find him doing hack-work for the 
44 North Wilts Herald," — " reporting, correct- 
ing manuscript and proofs, with a spice of 
reviewing and an unlimited amount of conden- 
sation." Thus he described his journalistic 
duties in a letter to an aunt. He wrote verses, 
too, with some music in them, and love stories

literary undertakings, historical and antiquarian 
essays and novels, followed in a few years ; and 
then came those rural sketches, contributed to 
various London periodicals, which were after- 
ward collected into volumes and now constitute 
the work for which chiefly he is known and 
admired. At about the age of twenty-seven he 
began to find himself, and the would-be novelist 
became gradually transformed into the student 
and interpreter of nature. 

Before he became absorbed in the book of 
nature, young Richard Jefferies was a great 
reader of printed books. Percy's " Reliques of 
Ancient Poetry " was a favorite of his when he 
was fifteen, and there were at Coate Farm many 
other old books accessible to him, and many 
more at his grandfather's house in Swindon. 
The " Odyssey " was much read by him in trans- 
lation ; also " Don Quixote," Shakespeare's 
poems, and Filmore's " Faust." An old Ency- 
clopaedia was a mine of wealth, and it often lay 
open before him, especially at the article on 
Magic. Strangely enough, White's " Stlborne " 
remained unknown to him until near the end of 
his life. 

Here let us introduce the biographer's picture 
of young Jefferies in his fretful days of ferment 
and vague desire. 

" But however bitter the days of poverty, loneliness, 
misunderstanding, and constraint, the time when he was 
sixteen and seventeen had probably as great sweetness 
as bitterness, since the two go together in their extremes 
at least as much at that as at any other age. They say 
that, though he often carried his gun, he was less and 
less fond of shooting after he was fifteen or so. Yet he 
would still bring home a snipe on a frosty day, or a jay's 
wing in the spring from Burderop. He hung about on 
stiles by Maxell and Great Maxell fields, on the footpath 
to Badbury Lane, or by the brooks, or on the Reservoir, 
or on the Downs, and dreamed and thought. With his 
finger on the trigger, he « hesitated, dropped the barrel, 
and watched the beautiful bird,' and • that watching 
so often stayed the shot that at last it grew to be a 
habit.' " 

The sensuousness of his ardent nature was free 
from grossness. An early passage in the biog- 
raphy calls attention to his delicacy of taste and 
sensibility. 

" « The Story of My Heart,' ■ The Dewy Morn,' and 
all his later books, are full of proofs of his exquisite 
physical sensitiveness; but the physical was always akin 
to the spiritual as the flower to the perfume. His tastes 
were delicate. He smoked little; and he was a small 
drinker, taking not even a glass of porter for his dinner 
unless his reporting had been heavy. His sense of touch 
seems to have a soul of its own. To touch the lichened 
bark of a tree was to repeat his prayer for deeper soul- 
life. . . . The spirit exalted this sensuousness; the 
senses preserved the sweetness of the spirit In another 
nature, senses so opulent, especially if aided by an im-

perfect love, might have wrought their own destruction. 
But in Jefferies the senses perform always and only the 
functions of the sold, and the purity of his passion equals 
its fearlessness in whatever swoons and energies time 
may bring." 

The meaning of the last clause is a little obscure ; 
and the biographer still remains tantalizingly 
vague when he goes on to illustrate the courage 
and spirit that went with this exquisite delicacy, 
by telling of a long fight the young man had 
with a soldier, in which " he held his own ; but 
as they were shaking hands at the end, his 
enemy struck a treacherous blow that sent him 
home with a broken nose." However, there are 
other and better evidences in his life-story that 
Richard Jefferies was no molly-coddle, and our 
liking for his books and himself need be dimin- 
ished by no want of respect for his sturdiness 
of character. 

In 1874 Jefferies was married to Miss Jessie 
Baden, of Day House Farm, and the two lived for 
a short time at the Coate homestead, then for two 
years at Swindon, and after that on the outskirts 
of London, where the open fields and the green 
woods were not too far away, and the publishers, 
the bookshops, and the libraries were sufficiently 
near. Here may be given a part of our natu- 
ralist's doctrine of right living, as put into the 
mouth of his M Gamekeeper at Home." 

"•It's indoors, sir, as kills half the people; being 
indoors three parts of the day, and next to that taking 
too much drink and vittals. Eating's as bad as drinking ; 
and there ain't nothing like fresh air and the smell of 
the woods. You should come out here in the spring, 
when the oak timber is throwed (because, you see, the 
sap be rising, and the bark strips then), and just sit 
down on a stick fresh peeled — I means a trunk, you 
know — and sniff up the scent of that there oak bark. 
It goes right down your throat, and preserves your lungs 
as the tan do leather. And I've heard say as folk who 
work in the tan yards never have no illness. There's 
always a smell from the trees, dead or living. 1 could 
tell what wood a log was in the dark by my nose; and 
the air is better where the woods be. The ladies up in 
the great house sometimes goes out into the fir planta- 
tions — the turpentine scents strong, you see— and they 
say it's good for the chest; but, bless you, you must 
live in it. People go abroad, I'm told, to live in the 
pine forests to cure 'em: I say these here oaks have 
got every bit as much good in that way.' " 

Besides the book just quoted from, mention 
must be made of those other " country books " 
that constitute Jefferies's best claim to remem- 
brance, — '• Wild Life in a Southern County," 
*' The Amateur Poacher," " Round About a 
Great Estate,' - h Nature Near London," M The 
Life of the Fields," « The Open Air." and the 
posthumous " Field and Hedgerow." In auto- 
biographic value " The Story of My Heart " 
comes first, while M The Dewy Morn " and 



" Be vis : the Story of a Boy " afford insight into 
the writer's mind and heart. 

The struggle with incurable disease during 
the last six years of Richard Jefferies's life, and 
his early death in 1887, make a sad story. Why 
this man of the open air and the fresh fields, of 
high thought and noble purpose, should have 
fallen a victim to the foul malignancy of an 
abdominal abscess, is one of the baffling mys- 
teries. The persistency with which he held him- 
self to his work, dictating to his wife when he 
could no longer hold a pen, is touching to read 
about, and was wholly worthy of him. But the 
regret grows that he could not have been spared 
to the present time — he would be only sixty- 
one if he were alive now — when he might well 
be doing his best work and writing from a wealth 
of experience and observation that would make 
even the best of his now extant productions seem 
of inferior quality. Faults of irrelevancy and 
carelessness and repetition might have been cor- 
rected, occasional dulness avoided, and a more 
unflagging human interest imparted to his page. 
From Mr. Thomas's closing chapter, containing 
a recapitulation of the life and work of Jefferies, 
we select a final quotation. 

" He enjoyed, simply and passionately, his own life 
and the life of others, and in his books that enjoyment 
survives, and their sincerity and variety keep, and will 
keep, them alive ; for akin to, and part of, bis gift of 
love was his power of using words. Nothing is more 
mysterious than this power, along with the kindred 
powers of artist and musician. It is the supreme proof, 
above beauty, physical strength, intelligence, that a man 
or woman lives. . . . Jefferies' words, it has been well 
said, are like a glassy covering of the things described. 
But they are often more than that: the things are for- 
gotten, and it is an aspect of them, a recreation of them, 
a finer development of them, which endures in the 
written words." 

This, and more like it, is a bit fantastical and 
forced, and it illustrates Mr. Thomas's chief 
fault as exhibited in his book : he is not seldom 
vague and fanciful and obscure, and one doubts 
whether he always clearly knows what he is try- 
ing to say. But much could easily be pardoned 
in so good a biography as he has given us. In 
the appended Bibliography, space might well 
have been spared for last year's English and 
American republication (with colored plates) of 
" The Open Air " and " The Life of the Fields," 
especially as some other reprints are noted. 
Among the portraits in Mr. Thomas's book are 
three of Richard Jefferies, two of his father, two 
of his mother, and one of his paternal grand- 
mother — all full of character.

On the Spiraeity of the Cosmos.* 



The ponderous work on " Design in Nature," 
by Dr. J. Bell Pettigrew, is probably the most 
extensive and serious single contribution to 
humorous literature which has appeared in 
recent years. It stands unique at this day and 
age. To find its peers, in respect of both 
matter and manner, one must go back to the 
period when the " Bridgewater Treatises " flour- 
ished. For the task which the author sets him- 
self is no less than " to trace design, order, 
and purpose in the inorganic and organic king- 
doms, especially the latter." In order to do this 
he gathers together in the space of some 1400 
well-printed quarto pages, elaborately illus- 
trated with about 2000 pictures, a most extra- 
ordinary collection of miscellaneous intellectual 
junk. One passes with absolutely no logical con- 
necting links from the morphology of protozoa 
to a discussion of methods of artificially produc- 
ing electricity; from the distribution of seeds to 
the movements of the stomach ; from water- 
spouts to Kant's Kritik and Greek archaeology ; 
and so on indefinitely. As an example of the 
possibilities in the way of the inclusion in one 
book of a great range of absolutely unrelated 
topics, it leaves Disraeli's " Curiosities of Liter- 
ature " far behind, and presses close on the dic- 
tionary and the encyclopaedia. 

In his reasoning the author is naive to a de- 
gree. He confuses absolutely definiteness of 
structure with " design." To him anything 
which has a definite structure is by virtue of 
that fact proof of "design" in the theological 
sense of the word. Since most things in the 
universe do have a definite form and structure, 
the wonder really is not that our author devoted 
three quarto volumes to illustrations in support 
of his thesis, but rather that he did not find it 
necessary to use thrice thirty-three. In partic- 
ular, Dr. Pettigrew was impressed by the uni- 
versality of spirals in the cosmos. You have 
them (to take some of the illustrations given) in 
waterspouts and whales, goats and gizzards, 
moths and men, and in a vast variety of other 
things inorganic and organic. Whence we are 
to conclude that spirality is a divine inspiration, 
and that we have here a proof of design. 

♦Design in Nature. Illustrated by Spiral and other 
Arrangements in the Inorganic and Organic Kingdoms as 
exemplified in Matter, Force, Life, Growth, Rhythms, etc., 
especially in Crystals, Plants, and Animals. With Examples 
selected from the Reproductive, Alimentary, Respiratory, 
Circulatory, Nervous, Muscular, Osseous, Locomotory, and 
other Systems of Animals. By J. Bell Pettigrew, M.D., 
etc. Illustrated by nearly 2000 figures. In three volumes. 
New York : Longmans, Green & Co. 



The utter absurdity of this spiral philosophy 
is evident if the author's general method of 
reasoning is stripped of all unnecessary verbiage 
and set forth in a series of simple propositions 
in the directly personal style cultivated through- 
out the book. Thus we have : 

1. In the inorganic world many things have 
a spiral form or structure (proved by pages of 
text and illustrations) . 

2. Many plants and animals show a spiral 
form or structure in some of their parts or organs 
(likewise proved by copious illustration in text 
and figures). 

3. When you think about this apparent 
coincidence it seems very remarkable, — now 
doesn t it, really ? 

4. The longer I (the author) think about it, 
the more remarkable it seems, and the less a 
coincidence. In fact, I feel it to be a very deep 
and precious thought, quite beyond the ability 
of my mind to fathom. 

5. Therefore — laus Deo! — it is not a 
coincidence, but a direct proof that Evolution is 
a snare and a delusion, and that nothing in the 
universe can " be explained as apart from pre- 
arrangement, design and a Designer." 

Such a method of argumentation takes one 
back to the good old days when a similar kind 
of reasoning was able to " prove " that the sun 
moved in an earth-centred orbit. It is as 
mediaeval as any cathedral. 

Seriously, it is a matter for sincere thankful- 
ness that the time is forever past when such a 
book as this can exert any significant influence 
on the thought or action of men. Mankind is 
perhaps more truly and deeply religious to-day 
than ever before. But men are educated, too. 
It is not demanded any more that to consort 
with Religion one must forswear Reason. One 
can only have respect for the enormous amount 
of labor that must have gone into the prepara- 
tion of these volumes ; they represent nearly a 
life-time's work. Yet at the same time one can- 
not but feel it a pity that this labor should 
have been so largely wasted, because of an entire 
misconception on the author's part of what has 
been the effect on human thought, and on the 
outlook of men on life, of the tremendous advance 
of science during the last fifty years. The day 
has passed when anyone can persuade men to a 
belief in a Higher Power by arguing that the 
Creator shows His infinite wisdom by fashioning 
men and corkscrews on the same plan.

The Domestic Life of Richard 
"Wagner.* 



Mr. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, in his 
remarkable book on the Life and Works of 
Wagner, divides that life into two equal parts. 
Wagner was born in 1813, during the agitations 
accompanying the close of Napoleon's stormy 
career ; when that sun set, a new one arose in 
a more extended and beneficent sphere. He 
died in 1883, having attained his three-score 
and ten in the full vigor of his powers. Men 
are now generally agreed that M Parsifal " shows 
no decline of creative energy or artistic skill. 
Mr. Chamberlain considers his first thirty-five 
years as his Lehrjahre ; his Meisters'hqft fills 
the remainder of his allotted span ; his Wander 
period is an irregular and interrupted time, 
which terminates with the definite settlement 
at Bayreuth. 

Wagner himself is authority for the state- 
ment that a man of exceptional abilities should 
not marry young ; and Shakespeare is seem- 
ingly of the opinion that " a young man married 
is a young man marred." Wagner was united 
in wedlock to Christine Wilhelmina Planer, an 
actress, in 1836, when he was twenty-three years 
old ; she was probably a few years his senior. 
She seems to have been an admirable woman 
enough, and while she had various stage engage- 
ments she never reached any real distinction 
in her art. Her early opportunities for educa- 
tion were limited, and her intellectual develop- 
ment quickly reached the line beyond which 
she refused to go. She was not of a sympa- 
thetic disposition, and she had nothing of the 
diplomacy which is capable of transforming a 
difficult situation into a triumph of her own 
cause. 

The case is a sufficiently clear one. Wagner, 
the exceptional man of his place and period, has 
an exceptional law and method of intellectual 
development. The wife, with the best of inten- 
tions, is unable to keep the pace ; she at length 
falls hopelessly behind, and her pain and dis- 
appointment fail of the alleviation which they 
demand. His letters to her show the husband 
in an habitual mood of amiably meeting various 
complaints, pacifying evident distress, attempt- 
ing to come to terms wherever possible. The 
trouble was not one that could permanently be 
allayed ; on the contrary, the passage of the years 
could only augment it. Wilhelmina belonged to 
those who found the New Opera beyond their

Wife. Translated, prefaced, etc., by William Ashton Ellis.

comprehension, and she allowed her appreciation 
of her husband's life-work to wane ; he makes 
heroic attempts to bring her peace, but the gulf 
between them only widens. 

With conditions such as these, the inevitable 
of course enters on the scene. The controversy 
that raged about the composer brought him 
partisans whose loyalty intensified with the prog- 
ress of the contest. Wagner himself had no 
doubts about his position and purposes ; the 
bitter utterances found in his letters are thus to 
be explained. In comparison with the extra- 
ordinary idea of the opera which dominated 
Wagner, the work of his contemporaries 
appeared to him in many ways a degradation 
of the art. His innovations penetrated into all 
the departments of music. He was also the first 
great man to prove himself great in both music 
and drama. His plays, as such, are distinct 
additions to stage literature of the first rank. 
During his years of struggle and misunderstand- 
ing, he needed friends and helpers ; he found 
them, and he grappled them to himself with 
hooks of steel. 

The influence that now makes itself vital in 
the composer's experience differs toto coelo from 
that of " Minna " Wagner, the wife ; more and 
more, as the letters show, the serious intentions 
of Wagner are omitted from his communications 
with her. The indications of decreasing sym- 
pathy are plain. With Mathilde Wesondonck, 
however, the exact reverse is the fact. During 
his life at Zurich, Wagner had met the Weson- 
doncks, and a close intimacy ensued ; Mathilde 
Wesondonck, a writer of plays and poems, 
enjoying the wealth and distinction which her 
husband had given her, became the friend of the 
great musician, and entered deeply into his labors 
and intentions. The contrast between the letters 
written to the two women is very great. Living 
habitually on the same plain with the composer, 
associating intimately with him in his artistic 
and intellectual pursuits, Frau Wesondonck 
understood his genius and foresaw his ultimate 
triumph. Mr. Ashton Ellis, the translator of 
the newly-published letters of Wagner to his 
wife Minna, has strong words to say on the 
dignity and purity of this friendship. Into 
"W agner's enlarging theory of his work, into 
his many and vigorous defences of his innova- 
tions, into his readings in philosophy, his ab- 
sorption in the views of Schopenhauer, where 
his wife wholly lost sight of him, Mathilde 
Wesondonck entered as a guide and mentor, 
and, with a woman's swift intuition, was often 
at the goal before Wagner found himself there. 



232 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



The situation was no doubt critical, and Minna 
Wagner had but little capability for dealing 
with it. 

The wife died in 1866 ; but before that time 
the rupture with her husband was complete. 
Meanwhile, Wagner had passed into a period of 
spiritual revolt. The pessimism of Schopenhauer, 
the study of Oriental Mysticism with its denial 
of the reality of the world, the profound (at 
first) appreciation of Wagner by Nietsche, led to 
the consequences which were naturally to be 
expected. The Superman lives in a realm that 
is beyond morals ; the conventions and scruples 
that limit other men are not for him. Wagner 
had his reasons for placing himself with the 
Zoroasters and Napoleons of the world. The 
relation with Cosima Wagner, however, did not 
begin until after the death of Minna ; and it 
terminated institutionally, which was in conso- 
nance with the life at Bayreuth, and the serene 
close of a checkered career. 

The letters of Richard Wagner constitute a 
history of his intellectual life astonishing and 
unique. No one has more freely expressed him- 
self in this form. The letters to Minna show 
him in the intimate relations of the family ; 
the letters to Mathilde Wesondonck display his 
hopes, his aspirations, the highest flights of 
his intelligence ; the letters to Liszt his artistic 
strivings and theories ; those to Uhligand Fischer 
and Heine, his vicissitudes and conflicts and 
triumphs as a musician. The exceptional man, 
the genius ahead of his time, the builder of the 
next advance, can here be studied in his own 
words and at close range. Here are human 
documents of inestimable value. The letters 
often exhibit Wagner in moods of gayety, and 
they are full of expressions of affection. This 
is from Dresden : 

"That's just the waj! I have been obliged to sus- 
pend writing a whole day; but you know it of old. . . . 
Lindenau called again, and the Rottorf, who greatly 
dislikes my being disturbed when at work, mistook the 
Premier Minister for a vagabond, and denied me to 
him; the poor man had to depart, leaving behind him 
a couple of lines, in which he begged me to call on him 
as soon as possible. The Rottorf was frightened out of 
her wits when she learnt that it had been the Minister; 
whilst I had to dress and make off to him myself. He 
had shown my composition to the King, and the latter 
had sat down to the piano at once, played it straight 
through, and expressed his great delight with it. . . . 

" If you could only see me in my lovely summer cos- 
tume! It's a perfect joy; only I made a bad choice 
with the violet gloves, for when I pulled them off for 
the first time, and was pointing with my finger on the 
bill of fare, the waiter bounded back in horror for my 
whole hand looked just like a gigantic violet, the gloves 
had shed their dye so." 



Here is a skit written on his birthday : 

" 'T was in the lovely month of May, 

That Richard Wagner burst his shell ; 
Therein had he prolonged his stay 

His best friends think it were as well." 

The nature of the difficulty between the hus- 
band and»wife is indicated by the following : 

" When I came home profoundly vexed and agitated 
by some new annoyance, a fresh mortification, another 
failure, what did my wife bestow on me in lieu of com- 
fort and uplifting sympathy? Reproaches, fresh re- 
proaches, nothing save reproaches! Homekeeping by 
nature, I remained in the house for it all; but at last, no 
no longer to express myself, convey my thoughts, and 
receive invigoration, but to hold my tongue, let my 
trouble eat into my soul, and be — alone ! This eternal 
restraint under which I had lived so long already, and 
which never allowed me to let myself quite go, on one 
side, without occasioning the fiercest scenes, weighed me 
down and wore away my health. What is the bodily 
tending you by all means lavished on me against the 
mental needed for a man of my inner excitableness ? 
Does my wife remember, perhaps, how coldly she once 
prevailed upon herself to nurse me on a bed of sickness 
a whole week without affection, because she could not 
forgive me a hasty expression before my illness ? " 

A series of concerts which he conducted in 
London gave him little satisfaction. About this 
he writes as follows, in his bitterness against 
conditions in the world of music there : 

" The concert itself put me out to the last degree. I 
can't go into everything that annoyed me at it; enough 
to say, the one thing lacking is that I should have to 
conduct ' Martha ' again ; such a programme came very 
near it. While conducting an aria from the ' Huguenots ' 
and a miserable overture by Onslow — an Englishman — 
I was seized by such disgust and remorse, that it got 
the better of me, and I made up my mind to demand 
my definite discharge next day." 

His friends dissuaded him, over a supper, from 
this step. He tells his wife this, and continues : 
" So be easy about me ; I shan't have so severe an 
attack of the dumps again, I hope. But it was the most 
idiotic concert of them all ; a mawkish symphony by one 
of the directors; then a fearfully tedious nonett by 
Spohr; a completely insignificant overture by Weber, 
which — to make things worse — had to be give da capo, 
as I had conducted it too finely; to conclude, the trashy 
overture by Onslow. Neither did the symphony in A 
go so well as at Zurich by a long way; such an English 
orchestra simply is not to be worked into an ecstasy!" 

Wagner, in a Preface to a publication of his 
plays — the Flying Dutchman, Tannhaeuser, 
Lohengrin, — had made some frank statements 
in regard to his early marriage, to which Minna 
Wagner, perhaps naturally, objected. He thus 
defends himself : 

" Now see, dear child, when I wished to give people 
a notion of the genesis of my works, and consequently 
of my psychological development, I could not pass over 
such a momentous crisis in my life as that which attaches 
to our union, without remaining unintelligible. It 
would have been foolish and entirely opposed to my real 
object, if I had sought to narrate our love-tale at full

length; all I required was just a few brief strokes to 
indicate an episode of some importance, which, for that 
matter, occurs in the life of many, nay, of most men, 
and need be only briefly touched because one presup- 
poses that everyone knows well enough what here is 
meant; to wit, the necessary consequences of a youthful 
marriage contracted at the behest of passion, without 
calm consideration of outer circumstances, against all 
obstacles and objections raised by that practical common- 
sense which foresees trouble." 

Of the translation of these letters, made by 
Mr. Ellis, nothing but good can be said ; it is 
of course what we have a right to expect from 
so practised a hand. Occasionally the translator 
attempts the, exact reproduction of a German 
idiom in his English, with the result of leaving 
the reader who is unacquainted with the foreign 
tongue in doubt as to what is meant. In his 
own notes and prefaces he seems to attach the 
blame — if this is at all to be suggested — to 
the wife in greater degree than to the husband ; 
but here every reader must come to his own 
conclusions. Mr. Ellis has done heroic work in 
presenting Wagner to the English-speaking 
public ; he has made a rendering of Wagner's 
elaborate writings in prose, he has reproduced 
the voluminous and accepted Life by Glasenapp, 
he has translated the various volumes of letters 
already published, and he promises a volume of 
the familiar letters to Wagner's blood relatives. 
His prefaces and notes are illuminating read- 
ing ; his discipleship is tempered by a sense of 
historical proportion, and with varied sympathy 
for the many conflicting interests involved. The 
students of Wagner must count him among the 
chief of those who, like Glasenapp, Muncker, 
Wolzogen, Tappert, Chamberlain, have done 
their best to report the Master aright to posterity. 
The publishers have made two fine volumes, 
with interesting portraits. The books contain 
what is needed to make their reading easy and 
profitable to the scholar.

From Arctic Ice to Irish Summer.* 

Although the recent achievements claimed by 
Cook and Peary have thrown the exploits of other 
Arctic explorers into temporary eclipse, there is 
room for such a book as " Conquering the Arctic 
Ice," by Mr. Ejnar Mikkelsen, one of the most 
recent of Arctic voyagers, whose story now appears 
for the first time in print He and Ernest de Koven 
Leffenwell were on the first Baldwin- Ziegler expedi- 
tion in 1901, and at that time resolved to organize 
an expediton of their own. Various difficulties, how- 
ever, prevented their carrying out their plans until 
1905. In that year these young men, assisted finan- 
cially by many friends — notably the Duchess of 
Bedford, the father of Mr. Leffenwell, the Royal 
Geographical Society, and the American Geograph- 
ical Society — fitted out a small ship, and in 1906 
started northward to prove or disprove the theory 
that land existed north of Alaska, and to explore 
Beaufort Sea. In the spring of 1907, after the 
wrecking of their ship the u Duchess of Bedford " 
during the previous hard winter, they organized an 
extended ice-trip which partly attained the object of 
their search. Having ascertained that the deep water 
close to the Alaskan coast precluded any land to 
the northward, at least not within such a distance 
of the coast as could be reached with dogs and sledges 
over the pack-ice, the author, hard driven by many 
accidents, returned to civilization by way of Alaska, 
fairly satisfied with the results of his strenuous efforts. 
His companion remained in the North to pursue 
further scientific studies. Mr. Mikkelsen's sledge 
journey of three thousand miles is said to be the 
longest ever made by an explorer. His story is 
simply and modestly told, and will be read with 
interest especially for its account of the natives whose 
characters and customs he had abundant opportun- 
ities to study. Those who are in the habit of 
regarding these natives as a low type of savages will 
do well to turn to Mr. Mikkelsen for enlightment, 
A large number of illustrations, many of them made 
from photographs taken by members of this party, 
add to the interest and verity of the work.

entitled his book on Alaska a " Handbook." It is 
a handbook in so far as it gives in a condensed way 
the widely scattered and reliable data concerning 
our far northwestern possessions ; but it is more than 
a compilation, for it has the enlivening and absorbing 
interest that comes from a first-hand observation of 
the land described. General Greely is peculiarly 
fitted to write just such a book. His extensive 
experience and travel in Alaska make him almost 
our sole authority on the diverse conditions existing 
there. He has made six visits to Alaska, has twice 
traversed the great Yukon Valley, visiting Fairbanks 
and Prince William Sound twice, and Nome thrice. 
Moreover, as the highest military commander on two 
occasions, and as the supervisor of the Alaskan 
Military Telegraph System of 4500 miles of land 
lines, with submarine cables and wireless stations, 
he has had unusual opportunities to gather data of 
his own, and to weigh the information gathered by 
other scientists and tourists. Hence there is an 
accuracy in his details about the resources, products, 
and attractions of Alaska, and an illuminating touch 
in his descriptions of the aspects of social, industrial, 
educational, commercial, political, and agricultural 
life there. Twenty-seven chapters of text, eight 
maps showing Alaska in relief, with views of the 
timber lands, the mining districts, and the ranges of 
the larger Alaskan animals, and twenty-four full- 
page illustrations from unusually good photographs, 
present Alaska in all its varied aspects. There is 
hardly a page that will not enlighten the reader, and 
there are few that will not surprise him with some 
novel information. How many persons know, for 
instance, that Alaska is not arctic in its climate ? 
The extremes of latitude and longitude in Alaska 
find their parallel in Europe between Norway and 
Sicily and from western France to central Russia. 
It is interesting to note, too, that the coldest month 
of the year at Sitka (31.4 degrees) closely corre- 
ponds with the coldest month of St. Louis (31.6 
degrees). But it has not always been so. "The 
rigors of the past climate are strikingly illustrated 
by the great depths to which the ground is frozen. 
In the Nome region a shaft has been sunk 120 feet 
without reaching ground free from frost, and near 
Dawson the earth was found frozen to a depth of 
200 feet." General Greely has performed a task, 
in writing this handbook, that will be of great ser- 
vice to tourists and prospectors, and will do much to 
remove our general ignorance about Alaska. 

Miss Elizabeth Bisland and Miss Anne Hoyt, 
masquerading as u Jane " and " Peripatetica," went 
to Sicily as seekers for the dead body of a great 
civilization, using their Theocritus oftener than their 
Baedeker, and waiting in the cold springtime for the 
coming of Persephone "laden with leaves and flowers 
and the waving corn." Every step they took stirred 
up wraiths of myths and history, and reminded them 
of Proteus rising from the sea, and of old Triton 
blowing his wreathed horn. The theatrical scenery 
of Taormina, the bones and stones of Syracuse, the 
temples of ancient Girgenti, " the nicest place " in 



Sicily, and the land of Goethe's " das Land, wo die 
Citronen bliih'n," Palermo, were visited in turn, — 
not in the Cook-dug channel manner, but in the 
leisurely fashion that befits the well-read and curi- 
ously inclined traveller. In many places in their 
charming book, u Seekers in Sicily," the authors 
strike the true Pagan note, though they are not 
always inclined to believe all they see and hear. 
The ear of Dionysius, for instance, is tested for them 
by their guide in large and vibrant tones ; but when 
they try the " whispering ear " in flat American 
tones, the echo fails. When they have proved the 
power of the wonderful ear by using a staccato voice, 
Peripatetica reflects, after the manner of Words- 
worth, " that one has to address life like that if 
one is to get a clear reply — to address it crisply, 
definitely, with quick inflections. Level, flat indefin- 
iteness will awake no echoes." Thus seriousness and 
playfulness go together in this happy visit to the fields 
of old renown, and provide a very readable book of 
travel. A unique feature of the book is the designs 
upon the cover and at the heads of chapters. Each 
design is some tribal totem of the original inhabitants 
of Sicily, which are still considered tokens of good 
luck. 

To readers who are inclined to associate books on 
Greece with ruins, excavations, inscriptions, and 
monuments, Miss Mabel Moore's volume entitled 
" Days in Hellas " will be a pleasing surprise. 
Miss Moore finds Greece a lively place in the midst 
of ancient glory. With a kindly feeling toward 
modern Greece, and a reverential respect for the 
past, the author views that land with a curious com- 
mingling of the ancient and the present times. 
Mount Pentelcos, for instance, is seen with its 
"twice-scarred brow," the one scar caused by the 
emissaries of Pericles, the makers of the Parthenon, 
and the other scar made by " Al armor Limited," 
a modern company engaged in supplying the world 
with Pentelic marble. The delineation of Greek 
character leaves little to be wished for, in spite of 
the modest statement in the author's preface that 
"the present volume is not offered in any sense as 
a study of Greek life or Greek character." Aliss 
Aloore has satisfied us that the lay reader who enjoys 
a medley of Greek life, with its gods and heroes 
mixed with its modern aspects, more than he does 
a treatise on archaeology, will find pleasure in this 
charming book. 

Mr. Edward Hutton, the author of " In Unknown 
Tuscany," and his friend Air. William Heywood 
who annotated the book, are, according to Air. Hutton, 
very different in temperament and had very different 
intentions in visiting Mont 'Aminta in Central Italy. 
For Air. Heywood, " the fact was everything ; for 
me it was little compared with the right expression 
of what I myself felt and saw." Hence Mr. Hutton 
dreams his dreams and sees his visions of the extra- 
ordinary beauty of the land, while Mr. Heywood, 
out of his abundant knowledge of Sienese history, 
gives a base and a substance to the book by way of 
noting the more prosaic historical facts. Legendary

lore, villa life, feudalistic tales and fanatical fictions, 
all of which abound in Tuscany — a land which few 
know well and none can comprehend — appeal to 
the author, who recounts his story in a style more 
graceful and easeful than is usually found in books 
of travel. Tuscany is a desolate land, says the 
author, but it "possesses a marvellous and virile 
beauty beyond almost any other part of Italy. How 
well we have loved and understood the almost femi- 
nine loveliness of Umbria, for instance, or the 
laughing country about Florence, the lines of the 
hills there as expressive as in a picture by Sandro 
Botticelli. . . . Here alone we may find, if we will, 
something of the profound and passionate beauty of 
Castile, the virility of the desert, the mystery and 
tyranny of the sun." Of the ways of the people of 
the mountains, Mr. Hutton writes in a manner that 
makes the reader for the time a traveller in unknown 
realms; and when the book closes with the life- 
history of David Lazzaretti, the new Messiah, the 
reader is prone to believe in all that has been 
written of the martyr of Mont 'Aininta and to dis- 
regard all the cold facts recorded by historians and 
note-makers. Eight color and twenty-four monotone 
illustrations afford a sympathetic undertone for the 
book. 

Notwithstanding Henri Beyle's statement that 
"la belle Touraine riexiste pas" that Touraine 
is a mere figment of the brain (a disparagement 
which can only be matched by a similar paradoxical 
assertion about Yarrow by Wordsworth), Mr. Frederic 
Lees and a companion found a tangible though evan- 
escent Touraine that furnished an enjoyable summer 
for them, and provided Mr. Lees with sufficient ma- 
terial, historical, legendary, picturesque, and archi- 
tectural, for his very charming book entitled "A 
Summer in Touraine." Few travel books afford 
more pleasant entertainment than this delightful 
sketch of sojourns among the castles and chateaux of 
Central France. Blood-stained Blois. royal Amboise, 
treasonable Loches, Chinon, Luynes, Tours, and 
stainless Chenonceaux, with its tales of Diana of 
Poitiers, Mary Stuart, Gabrielle and Francoise de 
Mercoeur, of youth and love and poetry, are among 
the many places visited and described. Even the 
old story of the treasure of Monti e'sor is retold in a 
fascinating way. Though the author in his preface 
says that the initial purpose of his book is to pro- 
vide " intellectual baggage " for tho»e who purpose 
to travel in the Indre-etrLoire and the adjoining 
departments of France, we cannot permit him to 
classify his book as a mere guide-book. Yet anyone 
who wishes to read up on the splendid old buildings 
of the Touraine district, and wishes to know how to 
make the trip by motor-car or otherwise, will find 
the volume of unusual interest and value. The fire- 
side traveller too will find that Mr. Lees's account is 
so accurate and vivid, and his style so pleasing, that 
he can travel con amove with the author. Twelve 
illustrations in color, over fourscore other illustra- 
tion*, and an excellent map, enhance the beauty and 
usefulness of the volume. 



Mr. Stephen Gwynn is well known for his several 
worthy literary activities and for his keen interest 
in all that pertains to Ireland. Of his own native 
Donegal he has written charmingly, almost poeti- 
cally ; and hence one reads the title of his latest 
book, "A Holiday in Connemara" with pleasurable 
anticipations. As a member of the Royal Com- 
mission, Mr. Gwynn went to Iar Connacht to gather 
facts for a detailed statistical account of the eco- 
nomic and social conditions of the most congested 
part of Ireland ; but he spent many hours following 
the streams for fish and the byways for ancient lore. 
Hence his book gives us a medley of land-lore, folk- 
lore, and fishing-lore, with a dash here and there of 
economic wisdom. It is not unlikely that the author 
considered it unwise to write too fully of the actual 
conditions of the country, as information on that 
subject will be presented to Parliament in a more 
prosaic form. Two salient points are made by Mr. 
Gwynn, however, regarding the conditions in this 
lamentably poverty-stricken district. First, remit- 
tances from America chiefly suffice to keep the 
inhabitants above ground ; and secondly, a sweeping 
redistribution of the population must be made before 
Ireland will thrive. Had Mr. Gwynn written more 
chapters like those on M Killary and Loug na Fooey," 
" Sunset on Killary," " On the Shores of Lough 
Mask," and '* Iorras Mor," he would have enter- 
tained the reader with his truer talent — the power 
of vivid description. For in this picturesque though 
melancholy country the people are more picturesque 
than in most parts of Ireland. The illustrations in 
the book are well chosen, and typical of the land 
and the people. 

Another book on Ireland, dealing with the eco- 
nomic rather than the picturesque features of the 
country, is given us by Mr. William Eleroy Curtis, 
the well-known traveller and correspondent. In the 
summer of 1908 Mr. Curtis visited Ireland at the 
instance of a syndicate of American newspapers to 
investigate the economic evolution going on in that 
land of poverty and happiness, and now publishes 
the results of his observations in his book entitled 
" One Irish Summer." Unlike many writers who 
are called upon to deal with the dry facts of the 
"dismal science" of economics, Mr. Curtis has the 
faculty of making statistics and formal information 
assume a not unpleasing aspect. Moreover, he is so 
well-informed on his subject from an historical point 
of view, and has so thoroughly assimilated his 
knowledge, that he is by no means dependent on 
dry facts and figures to give light and warmth to 
his discussions. Though the study of the redemp- 
tion of the people from poverty is Mr. Curtis's pri- 
mary theme, he is not amiss in studying Ireland as 
a land of story and humor, of beauty and pleasure, 
and of native traits and customs. His three months 
in the country appear to have furnished him abund- 
ant opportunity for going everywhere and writing 
about everything likely to interest the student of 
Irish affairs, or the casual trifler who lands at 
Queenstown and scurries round to Cork, Killarney,

Recent Fiction.* 



Unhappily named and ungainly in appearance, 
filling nearly six hundred pages of close typography, 
opening in a way that promises to tax the reader's 
endurance, and concerned from beginning to end 
with mean or commonplace characters, not one of 
whom is tricked out with the attributes that are com- 
monly thought necessary to arouse sympathy and 
retain interest, " The Old Wives' Tale," by Mr. 
Arnold Bennett, is nevertheless a remarkable work 
of fiction, a book of such sincerity, truthfulness, and 
insight as to make the ordinary novel seem hope- 
lessly shallow and artificial by comparison. Coming 
to us unheralded in the slack season, it proves to be 
the most significant novel of the summer, and prob- 
ably of a much longer period. The Staffordshire i 
town of Bursley, typical of the provincial life of 
mid-England, is the place, and the time is the stretch 
of years from the middle to the end of the nineteenth 
century. The stage-setting puts before our eyes a 
draper's shop in the central square of the town, and 
here our attention remains fixed, save for the single 
shifting of the scenery which gives us Paris for a 
contrast. The proprietor of the shop is a bed-ridden 
paralytic; his wife is a masterful person who directs 
the business with the help of Mr. Povey, the shop- 
assistant, and a dependency of ansemic virgins. 
There are two daughters in the household, children 
when the story opens, old women toward the close, 
and it is with the history of their lives that the book 
has to do. Constance, the elder, marries Mr. Povey, 
and in due course, the parents having died, takes 
over the management of the business, is widowed in 
middle life, and left with an idolized son who is 
nowise persuaded to follow in the footsteps of his 
ancestors, but developes strange modern tastes and 
propensities. Sophia, the younger daughter, has a 
more checkered career. Unlike her meek and self- 
effacing sister, she has a passionate nature that 
impels her to a disastrous adventure. The cheap 
charms of a commercial traveller engage her girlish 
fancy ; she carries on a clandestine correspondence 
with him, and finally elopes. He has recently come 
into a modest inheritance which seems to be bound-

less wealth, and the eloping couple go to London, 
with Paris as their final objective. Marriage is no 
part of his plan, but he is forced into it by Sophia's 
obstinate refusal to go any farther than London ex- 
cept with a legally constituted husband. Several 
years of pleasure-seeking follow; then, on the eve 
of the Franco-Prussian war, he is at the end of his 
resources, and deserts his wife, who has long since 
lost all her illusions. She has a long and serious 
illness, through which she is nursed by a kind-hearted 
creature — a woman of the half-world — whose charge 
she has accidentally become. After her recovery 
she undertakes the management of a pension, and 
maintains it successfully during the months of the 
sipge and the commune. Frugality and practical 
good sense — the inheritance of her stock — serve 
her in this crisis ; her affairs prosper, she enlarges her 
operations, and when her health gives way in middle 
age, she sells her hostelry to a syndicate, and finds 
herself a woman of leisure with a comfortable for- 
tune. All this time she' has been dead to Bursley 
and her family, but one day the relationship is acci- 
dentally reestablished, and she goes to England to 
visit her sister, also comfortably retired from busi- 
ness. The visit grows into a stay, and for some 
ten years the two old women share their old home. 
Then Sophia learns that her husband is not dead, 
but is just at the point of ending a wretched and 
poverty-stricken life ; she hastens to his last refuge, 
and finds only his dead body. She has thought of 
him only with disgust for many years, but this 
shock nevertheless proves fatal. Constance, now left 
alone, does not long survive, and the family is ex- 
tinct, save for her son, whom the world has not taken 
at his mother's appraisal, and whose colorless exist- 
ence makes no appeal to our curiosity. 

Such is the outline of a book which the author 
describes as " a novel of life." This it is in a very 
exact and human sense. Just life, real and un- 
adorned, a futile affair for all concerned, is what is 
portrayed in its pages. It is life viewed with micro- 
scopic vision, described with absolute fidelity, dis- 
torted by no trace of caricature, and commented upon, 
as we pass from phase to phase, with grave, sardonic, 
sometimes almost savage, irony. There is not a char- 
acter in the book that is ennobled or glorified by the 
devices dear to the romantic novelist; there is no 
alluring heroine and no conquering hero, there is no 
indulgence in empty rhetoric, and there is no appar- 
ent effort to heighten either motive or situation. Yet 
with all this restraint, or perhaps just because of it, 
the final impression is deep and the resultant force 
overwhelming. As the figures pass before our eyes, 
and their lives one by one gutter out, we are made 
to know them better than we know most of the human 
beings of our actual acquaintance. This is true not 
only of the half dozen chiefly concerned, but also of 
the minor figures in almost equal degree. If we 
were transported by some magic carpet to mid- 
Victorian Bursley, we should have the advantage 
over their neighbors in our intimate acquaintance 
with these people. We understand them as we under-

stand Balzac's men and women, and the great French 
novelist never shaped more authentic creations. The 
coloring of this novel is hy no means as drab as this 
or any outline would seem to indicate. It is ani- 
mated and even vivacious, for the most part cheerful 
in tone and shot through with gleams of humor. Its 
texture is so finely wrought that it is not to be read 
by leaps and bounds without serious loss. It extends 
to nearly a quarter of a million words, and few of 
them are superfluous. If it be censured for defect 
of ideality, it must be praised all the more for shrewd- 
ness, for accuracy of observation, and for the deep 
note of human sympathy which only the most care- 
less of readers could miss. Moreover, although in 
its essence it is impressive of the futility of the average 
life, we gather this message only in our reflective 
moments of semi-detachment ; we do not brood over 
it, any more than do the characters themselves. To 
them, life is an affair of ups and downs, no doubt, 
but it is also too closely packed with immediate inter- 
ests to permit of their viewing it in broad perspective. 
The author will probably be charged with pessimism, 
but one has only to contrast his method with that of 
a genuine pessimist like Mr. Thomas Hardy to realize 
that the term is hardly elastic enough to cover both 
cases. 

The readers of Mr. Maurice Hewlett's "Halfway 
House," who made the acquaintance of John Senhouse 
in that charming book, will be glad to have further 
intercourse with him in the pages of u Open Country." 
The new book is not, however, a sequel, since its 
action is placed several years earlier, and it is a little 
disconcerting, with fresh memories of the romance 
previously unfolded, to realize that he had previously 
been entangled in the sentimental complications now 
revealed. He is the same strenuous individualist and 
apostle of the simple life that we learned to know 
before, and he flouts conventions with the same reck- 
less unconcern. The young woman in the present 
case is named Sanchia, and 6he proves plastic stuff 
for his moulding. He becomes her accepted guide, 
philosopher, and friend, and she turns to him in all 
her perplexities. But when he would play the lover 
also, he discovers that she has put his teachings to 
such practical purpose that she throws herself into 
the arms of a very different sort of man, incidentally 
possessed of an inconvenient wife. This does not 
seem to matter seriously to the emancipated Sanchia, 
and she does not even require him to save appear- 
ances by obtaining the divorce that might be his for 
the asking. Upon learning what the outcome of his 
philosophy, thus applied, has been, Senhouse once 
more devotes himself to his self-appointed task of 
adorning the wa^te places of England with exotic 
blooms. The author styles this extravagant inven- 
tion " a comedy with a sting,'' but having consider- 
ately told us, in the earlier novel of a later day, how 
Senhouse found consolation, the '• sting " does not 
do a lasting hurt to our feelings any more than to 
. those of its victim. The philosophy of our individ- 
ualist hero is set forth in his talks with Sanchia, and 
more formally in his letters to her. It is always a 



plausible philosophy, and in many respects a sound 
one. ''He could pare off detail and accident so 
nearly that the straight bold outline of conduct lay 
plain to be seen, stretching far and ahead of her 
like parallel lines of railway over swamps. To talk 
with him was to be taken on to a windy height and 
shown the world of men mapped out below you, 
accidentals blurred away, only the salient things 
sharply defined." There is more than a bitter kernel 
of truth in his indictment of our boasted modern 
civilization. 

•' If we act individually like maniacs, as I've been telling 
you we do, we act in the masses like the hosts of Midian. 
Until war — to name but one public vice — is spoken of in 
the terms we now use to reprobate drunkenness, or gluttony, 
or the drug-habit, I decline to recognise that we are civilized 
at all. But, so far from that, we devastate the heathen ; we 
exhaust ourselves in armaments ; we cause the flower of our 
youth to perish for all-red maps ; we still teach diplomats 
to lie and politicians to cadge for votes like the street-boys 
for coppers ; we thieve at large, brag the great year through, 
bluster, howl at other people pla\ing games for us ; lift pious 
hands (to a heaven we don't believe in) at our rival's enor- 
mities ; we cant and vapour — out upon us ! and what for ? 
For two things only, Sanchia, for two things which are fatal 
to real civilization — that money may be easy and that labour 
may be saved." 

This is the substance of Senhouse's social philosophy 
— an obviously Ruskinian gospel — and his religious 
notions are akin to those of Faust, piercing to the 
very emotional root of the whole matter. 

'' Herr Doctor wnrden da katechisirt," 
for Sanchia shares Margaret's curiosity upon the sub- 
ject, and her questions evoke from him the lengthiest 
and soberest of his epistolary confessions. 

"True Tilda," by Mr. Quiller-Couch, is the story 
of a girl of ten or thereabouts, a child acrobat in a 
travelling show, and a boy of about the same age, 
whom she rescues from an orphanage where he is 
cruelly treated, and carries off with her in a search 
for his lost father. The clues are of the slenderest, 
and instinct rather than reason keeps them in sight, 
but they lead to the right spot, which is an island in 
the Bristol channel. The wanderings of the two 
children constitute a veritable Odyssey, leading from 
London to the western sea by canal boats, travelling 
caravans, and river barges. There is a pursuer — 
the Reverend Glasson of the orphanage — but he is 
outwitted and outdistanced, and Tilda has the satis- 
faction of uniting her protigS with the parent who 
had not known of his existence. There the story 
ends, with a hint that something interesting will 
happen when the children grow up. Although a 
book about children, it is distinctly designed for their 
elders to read, and is one of the happiest of the 
author's whimsical inventions. Tilda is a constant 
joy and refreshment, and her adventures make us 
acquainted with a great variety of eccentric and 
amusing people, figured for us as from Dickens's 
own world. So much humor, entertaining adventure, 
and unconventional life is not often packed within 
a single pair of covers.

with native life and character, but unfortunately 
committed to the " white man's burden " theory. In 
" The End of the Road " he deals with the " big 
black brothers " of South Africa, not without sym- 
pathy, but from the viewpoint of one who takes it 
for granted that all means are justifiable which have 
for their end the replacement of an inferior by a 
superior civilization. Still, the native question is not 
uppermost in this new novel, for the chief struggle 
is between two types of white civilization — the old 
agricultural type, whether Boer or English, and the 
new mining and industrial type. More briefly stated, 
it is the struggle between the road and the railroad. 
The hero is a transport rider, one of the pioneers 
who pushed the road northward toward the Zambesi, 
a man who has lived upon the road most of his life, 
and who views with distrust the growth of the rail- 
road and the development of the mining compound. 
He is an Englishman of gentle origin, and meets his 
fate when a young Englishwoman, an archaeologist's 
daughter, comes across his path. He follows her 
to her English home, makes her his wife, and tries 
to settle down in an English country town. But the 
plan does not make for happiness ; the old Wander- 
lust seizes upon him, and the story ends, as it began, 
in South Africa, whither the wife has consented to 
return. The story is well worth reading ; its simple 
plot is effective, and its figures and scenes have 
reality. 

Modern Egypt, with its complicated politics and 
its cosmopolitan society, offers a tempting theme to 
the novelist. It was exploited a year or so ago by 
Sir Gilbert Parker in " The Weavers," which make 
much of its melodramatic possibilities. But for 
genuine melodrama, which finds no coloring too 
violent and no situation too absurd, we must award 
the palm to Mr. Hall Caine, whose "White Prophet" 
distances all possible competitors. This compound 
of preposterous politics and sickly sentiment deals 
with the career of a religious fanatic, who becomes 
the leader of the forces of Egyptian nationalism, 
preaches to the astonished ears of Islam a gospel of 
universal brotherhood (including the fellowship of 
Christians), and is defeated by treachery when just 
about to realize his dream of Egypt for the Egyptians. 
This fantastic narrative may be imagined as of the 
past or the future, as the reader pleases. Despite 
his denials, Mr. Caine has given us figures that must 
be identified in part with historical characters. His 
consul-general is Lord Cromer with a difference, his 
" white prophet " is a new Mahdi with something of 
the old iu his make-up, and his other puppets fre- 
quently recall men who have been connected with the 
English occupation. But both characters and hap- 
penings, although separately identifiable, are jumbled 
in a composite grouping which is the author's own. 
The probabilities are not for this sensation-monger. 
His heroine is made to seek out the prophet, whom 
she believes to have slain her father, and actually to 
marry him that she may learn his secrets and betray 
him to the government. She is to know the slayer 
by a missing finger, but does not discover that the 



prophet's fingers are all on his hands until after she 
has been his wife for some weeks. Nor does he all 
this time suspect her of being an Englishwoman ! 
Really, there are some limits to the credulity of the 
most guileless of revellers in romantic fiction. When 
the prophet's plans come to naught, and he discovers 
his wife's treachery, he not only forgives her, but 
divorces her in the summary Mohammedan fashion, 
in order that she may rejoin her English lover. This 
lover, who is the son of the consul-general, and an 
army officer of high rank, has so sympathized with 
the prophet as to disobey orders, assault his superior, 
and flee from Cairo to escape punishment. Dis- 
guised as a Bedouin sheikh, he becomes the prophet's 
confidant and special emissary, and upon returning 
to Cairo is taken for the prophet himself, and is 
nearly executed by the order of his own father. His 
identity discovered, he is court-martialed and sen- 
tenced to death for insubordination ; an appeal is 
then made to the clemency of the king, who not only 
pardons him, but raises him to the chief command 
of the army in Egypt. At this juncture, Mr. Caine 
considerately calls a halt upon his invention, and we 
close the book with a gasp.

Briefs on New Books. 



Readers of Mr. Brady's " A Mission- 

;i^Z/,» ar -y in the Far Wert " and Bish °p 

Talbot's " My People of the Plains " 
will enjoy reading the somewhat similarwork entitled 
" A Bishop in the Rough " ( Dutton). John Sheep- 
shanks, now the Right Reverend, the Lord Bishop 
of Norwich, spent his 'prentice years in laudable 
missionary work in the great Northwest of Canada, 
visited the land of Brigham Young, labored in the 
Sandwich Islands, in China, and elsewhere in Asia, 
and kept, during the years from 1859 to 1867, a 
journal, which is now edited for publication by the 
Reverend D. Wallace Duthie. Both the journalist 
and the editor have done their literary work well, 
and the book makes capital reading, — much better, 
we fancy, than is usually found in the journals of 
present-day missionaries. Pleasant pictures of our 
own Western land as it appeared nearly three-score 
years ago, descriptions of the wild fastnesses of 
British Columbia and of the customs of the unspoilt 
Sandwich Islanders, and lucid expositions ot the state 
of China when the door was only beginning to swing 
on its international hinges, are some of the distinctive 
features of the book. However austere the present 
Bishop of Norwich may be, — and one detects a bit 
of this quality in his extended preface dealing with 
the Established Church, — he certainly was not with- 
out genial humor and breadth of spirit when in his 
earlier days. Probably the most interesting incident 
in the book is that in which the author, on the invita- 
invitation of Brigham Young, preached in the great 
Mormon Tabernacle at Salt Lake City. The scene 



1909.] 



THE DIAL

is thus described : " Next Sunday the Tabernacle 
was the scene of a singular spectacle. Never before 
or since has an Anglican priest preached to the 
Assembly of Mormons ; never, perhaps, in the his- 
tory of the church has one of her ministers testified 
before a community of heretics. Before him were 
3000 people, all men, heads of families, mainly from 
his own country, ' mostly earnest and fanatical, 
swallowing eagerly the wildest stories and most 
extravagant doctrines, whatever is put before them 
by the Prophet and his crew.' Behind him on the 
platform sat the apostles and elders. The President's 
chair was empty, but as the preacher began to speak 
he was aware of someone moving near him, and saw 
Brigham Young himself on his knees, pushing a 
cushion toward his feet, having remembered the 
custom to use one for kneeling." John of Norwich 
was doubtless great in spiritual strength in those 
days, and even in his great age his strength has 
apparently not diminished. His book testifies that 
he learned the world at first hand, digested his 
knowledge with gusto and fervor, and that he was 
able to keep a lively journal which vividly recalls 
for us the stirring events of his active life. 

Three years and a half ago, when 
C JX*£3L. Macedonia was having those lively 

times that formed a part of the pre- 
liminaries to much more recent and more momentous 
events in Turkish history, Mr. Albert Sonnichsen, 
scenting blood and gunpowder from afar, made his 
way into the very heart of the turbulent district, and, 
donning bandit costume, enjoyed for eight months 
the intimate acquaintance and comradeship of out- 
laws. "Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit" is 
the title he now gives to the story of his rough-and- 
tumble experience, and as a picture of people and 
conditions unfamiliar to most readers the book has 
decided merits. Those who remember the author's 
" Ten Months a Captive among Filipinos " will find 
the same readable style in this later narrative, 
together with more of the pulse-quickening, hair- 
raising element of dangerous adventure and narrow 
escape. From the last chapter, which contains the 
bandit's own story of the memorable capture of Miss 
Stone, we quote the following indignant outburst 
from Hristo Tchernopeef, " the bad man," chief of 
the kidnapping party : " What greasy hypocrites 
they are, the smug diplomats and editors and the 
clergy, with their hanging jowls and rotund bellies ! 
Yes, brigands we are. They allow our women and 
small babies to be outraged and slaughtered, and 
when we ask them for help, only to stop it, in the 
name of Christ, they give us soft, lying words. And 
then, when we give one of their women a few months' 
worry and discomfort, which we more than share 
with her, only to give us the means to save a million 
women from death, or worse, we are brigands." As 
a view of brigandage from the inside, Mr. Sonnich- 
sen's story has elements of novelty and of human 
interest. The pictures, from photographs taken 
chiefly by himself, one infers, are many and good. 



A lack is felt in the absence of any preliminary or 
supplementary chapter to acquaint the forgetful or 
ignorant reader with the political conditions bearing 
on the narrative, and to explain more clearly how 
and with what ostensible purpose the writer gained 
so speedy access to the companionship and confidence 
of the brigand chiefs. Finally, either a glossary 
defining the local terms used, or a condescending 
willingness to use English equivalents, would have 
been appreciated by the plain reader. The book is 
published by Messrs. Daffield & Co. 

D . , . Professor Svante Arrhenius, Director 

Speculations «»»«■» • • r. i i ■, 

on the life of of the JNobel institute in Stockholm, 
the Universe. j s p er haps the foremost theorizer of 
the present day in the domain of the evolution of 
the universe. His latest work, translated into En- 
glish by Dr. H. Boras, with the title, " The Life of 
the Universe" (Harper), is comprised in two coat- 
pocket volumes, and gives a succinct account of 
cosmogonic speculations from the earliest ages to 
the present time. The 124 pages of Volume I. 
treat of the ideas on the origin of the universe which 
were held by primitive peoples, by ancient civilized 
nations, by early philosophers (chiefly Grecian), 
and finally by the group of more modern thinkers 
up to and including the contemporaries of Newton. 
All this is told in an interesting way, though 
crowded with details. The second volume opens 
with a brief sketch of the theorizing from Newton 
to Laplace. This period is especially characterized 
by the subjection of cosmogonic theories to mathe- 
matical tests. While the well-known Laplacian 
hypothesis of the nebular evolution of our own sys- 
tem, and (by inference) of other systems, was estab- 
lishing itself to the exclusion of former notions, the 
science of physics was making wonderful strides. 
The revelations of the spectroscope, the discoveries 
of radioactivity and of the radiation pressure of 
light, — indeed, a mass of modern research in the 
atomistic domain where physics, chemistry, and 
biology meet on common ground, — have led to 
very considerable modifications of former cosmo- 
gonic speculations. To these modifications Dr. Arr- 
henius devotes the bulk of his second volume. Such 
topics as the maintenance of solar radiation, the 
results of collisions of cosmic bodies, and the origin 
of life on the Earth, are sketchily treated. Finally, 
the author defends himself from the charge that 
such philosophizing has no practical value, by 
asserting that the progress of science tends ever to 
the elevation of humanity and the spread of the 
principles of universal brotherhood. 

Appreciation When Dr - Samuel McChord Crothers 
of a genial writes about Dr. Oliver Wendell 

humorist. Holmes, he is pretty sure to be worth 

reading — even better reading for some of us than 
Mr. Gilbert Chesterton on Mr. Bernard Shaw. Dr. 
Crothers's " Atlantic " article on "The Autocrat and 
his Fellow-Boarders," with the addition of eleven 
" selected poems " (including, of course, the " One- 



240 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Hoss Shay," " The Height of the Ridiculous," and 
" The Chambered Nautilus "), and a frontispiece 
portrait of the poet-essayist, forms a neat little volume 
(Houghton), convenient for the pocket, the hand, 
and the eyes. It takes a thief to catch a thief, and 
it takes a gentle humorist like Dr. Crothers to seize 
upon and set luminously before us the distinctive 
traits and qualities of that earlier master of gentle 
humor, the ever-delightful Autocrat. Here is one 
way in which, near the end of his essay, the author 
characterizes Dr. Holmes's mind : " Dr. Holmes 
perfected the small stereoscope for hand use. The 
invention was typical of the quality of his own mind. 
The stereoscope is ' an optical instrument for repre- 
senting in apparent relief and solidity all natural 
objects by uniting into one image two representa- 
tions of these objects as seen by each eye separately.' 
The ordinary prosaic statement of fact presents a 
flat surface. The object of thought does not stand 
out from its own background. We look through 
the eyes of Dr. Holmes and we have a stereoscopic 
view. . . . The stereoscopic mind makes an abstract 
idea seem real." One further quotation : after 
pointing out that " The Autocrat of the Breakfast- 
Table " was not easy to write, as no good book is, 
the author advises the writer who is unusually fluent 
to "take warning from the instructions which 
accompany his fountain-pen : When this pen flows 
too freely it is a sign that it is nearly empty and 
should be filled." Apart from the natural affinity 
between two cognate minds, Dr. Crothers may well 
take an additional interest in Holmes as the son of 
a former minister of the First Church in Cam- 
bridge — the very pulpit now occupied by himself. 
A book holding so much good in so small compass 
as this centennial study of the Autocrat is not met 
with every day. 

An uncommon In the old Westphalian city of Her- 
tvpe of royal ford, there flourished in the days of 
womanhood. fa e Lutheran revolt an ancient con- 
vent which somehow escaped the common monastic 
fate of suppression and was made part of the new 
reformed rhgime. Herford was " protestanized," 
and remained for three centuries longer the refuge 
of luckless ladies and distressed princesses. Among 
the abbesses of this " Protestant nunnery " is num- 
bered a lady of Stuart blood, Elizabeth, princess 
Palatine, granddaughter of James I. and maternal 
aunt of George I. The biography of this abbess has 
recently been written by Elizabeth Godfrey under 
the title " A Sister of Prince Rupert " (John Lane). 
It is not a stirring story that the author has to tell — 
the dramatic element is almost wholly wanting ; still, 
the story, because of a deep human interest, proves 
very attractive. Like so many of her Stuart kins- 
folk, Elizabeth was not a stranger to adversity : she 
was born just before her father, the " Winter King," 
accepted the fatal Bohemian crown ; her early years 
were spent in exile in Brandenburg and Holland ; 
poverty was an almost continuous guest at her 



mother's home. But, unlike the other Stuarts, she 
lived her life in comparative freedom from political 
strife and intrigue ; hers was the quiet life of philo- 
sophic study and religious contemplation. It is this 
intellectual phase of Elizabeth's life and character 
that the author particularly emphasizes. Little 
space is given to family troubles and dynastic disap- 
pointments, but much to her friendship for Descartes 
and her interest in his philosophic teachings. Some 
attention is also paid to the general question of 
higher education among women in the seventeenth 
century. As a contribution to history, the biography 
does not take high rank ; for the Princess Elizabeth 
did not accomplish much of enduring value either 
in the political or in the intellectual field. Yet the 
world cannot fail to be interested in a princess who 
refused to exchange her religious faith for a crown ; 
who enjoyed the society of " literary ladies "; who 
patronized Quakers and Quietists. As a study of 
the intellectual currents of the seventeenth century, 
Miss Godfrey's work has considerable interest ; but 
most of all it will be appreciated as a faithful and 
sympathetic picture of an unusual type of royal 
womanhood. 

In a compact little volume of a hun- 
£S™Sl. dred and twenty-five pages, entitled 

"India" (B. W. Huebsch), Mr. J. 
Keir Hardie, the Labor leader in the British Par- 
liament, records the impressions and information 
gathered by him from a brief sojourn in that per- 
turbed land. The core of the book lies in its views 
regarding India " before taking and after taking " 
British treatment. The conclusion is, in the words 
of Burke when discussing a similar problem in 
which the American Colonies were concerned, that 
" everything given as a remedy to the public com- 
plaint has been followed by a heightening of the 
distemper." This distemper of the nation, asserts 
Mr. Hardie, is now practically beyond the control 
of the British Government, and all because the 
superimposed Governors have failed to recognise 
the natural power of the highly-educated natives. 
" A very little statesmanship, inspired by a very lit- 
tle sympathetic appreciation of the situation, could 
easily set things to rights." When British officials 
are restrained from acting on official boards of which 
they are not even members ; when the councils for 
villages are popularly elected and are held respon- 
sible for the collection of taxes ; when collectors and 
other permanent officials are not made chairmen of 
any boards ; when promotion for the natives from the 
Provincial Civil Service to the Indian Civil Service 
without the red-tape requirement of going to London 
to take the examination for promotion, — when these 
reforms are established, says the author, peace and 
prosperity will come to India. Mr. Hardie has not, 
we may say, assimilated all his information gathered 
in his two months' stay in India, but he has written 
a book that will interest and instruct everyone who 
is interested in Great Britain's major problem.

Thehutorv ^ T ' Harold Murdock, a Boston 

of the great banker and man of letters, is well 

Botton fire. equipped to rehearse the story of 

Boston's great fire of thirty-seven years ago, and he 
tells it admirably in epistolary form, naming his 
book " 1872 : Letters Written by a Gentleman in 
Boston to his Friend in Paris, Describing the Great 
Fire." The volume is issued in a sumptuous limited 
edition (Houghton) with many illustrations both of 
Boston before the fire and of scenes in the burning 
or already burnt district. The woodcuts and litho- 
graphs transport the reader to that good old time 
when Boston streets were even more crooked and 
narrow and tangled than at present ; and the letters, 
with their skilfully feigned appearance of having 
been hurriedly written while the ruins were still 
smoking, maintain the illusion. But as Mr. Mur- 
dock was only ten years old at the time of the fire, 
he could hardly have seen and done all that the 
supposed letter-writer chronicles as his part in the 
tremendous drama. However, there is no attempt 
to deceive or to mystify. The author appends his 
list of authorities, with other explanatory and illus- 
trative matter, and one must admire the skill with 
which he has used his material. A sharp contrast 
with present municipal conditions is revealed in the 
statement that at the time of the fire u the city 
fathers were for the most part men of standing and 
responsibility in the community, and Boston suffered 
more from their narrow conservatism and conscien- 
tious economies than from anything suggestive of 
that gross evil the modern name for which is ' graft.' " 
A passing reference reminds the reader that Froude 
was lecturing in Tremont Temple, on the English in 
Ireland, before the embers had cooled. He had but 
a small audience and was not in his happiest mood. 



Notes. 



" The Arts of Japan," by Air. Edward Dillon, and 
" Illuminated Manuscripts," by Mr. John W. Bradley, 
are two new volumes m the series of " Little Books on 
Art," published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

" The Short Story in English," by Professor Henry 
Seidal Canby of Yale, will be issued at once by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. This is intended to be a guide, in 
a relatively new field, for those who are interested in 
the sources of modern literature. 

It is generally understood that there will be no fur- 
ther publication of fiction by George Meredith, but he 
has left poems in manuscript, and a collection is to be 
made of his occasional articles in the reviews — espe- 
cially in the " Fortnightly Review." 

" Waverley Synopses " is a little book which is 
exactly what its title indicates. The plots of the novels 
are summarized by Mr. J. Walker McSpadden, and 
the volume is published by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell 
& Co. An Index to characters is appended. 

" The American Jewish Year Book " for 5670 has 
for its special feature a discussion of " The Passport 
Question in Congress," as it affects Jews desiring to 
travel in Russia. There is also an important article on 



the recent grouping into a single organization of the 
Jewish societies of the City of New York. The volume 
is edited by Mr. Herbert Friedenwald, and issued by 
the Jewish Publication Society of America. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. publish a neat 
edition of George Eliot's works, in light volumes on 
thin paper and in flexible leather covers, at a moderate 
price. One of the volumes contains the essays and 
poems, which are too apt to be forgotten by readers of 
the novels. 

We are opposed upon principle to condensation of 
standard works, but some excuse may be offered in the 
case of Carlyle's " Frederick the Great." Mr. Edgar 
Sanderson has prepared the reduced form of this great 
history, and the book is published by Messrs. A.. C. 
McClurg & Co. 

A new volume in "The Mermaid Series," imported 
by the Messrs. Scribner, gives us the complete plays of 
Robert Greene, now newly edited for this series by 
Professor Thomas H. Dickinson. New ■ Mermaid " 
volumes are always welcome, and the absence of a 
Greene from the series has long been felt. 

An interesting collection of "Old Fashioned Fairy 
Tales " has been made by Mrs. Marion Foster Wash- 
burae, and will be published this Fall by Messrs. Rand, 
McNally & Co. The same firm has also in press a 
handsomely-illustrated edition of Miss Mulock's per- 
ennial story, " The Little Lame Prince." 

It has now been decided to bring out Mr. William 
De Morgan's new novel, " It Never Can Happen Again," 
in England and America on November 16, this being 
the date of Mr. De Morgan's seventieth birthday. Mr. 
William Heinemann will be the London publisher, while 
the American publishers will be Messrs. Henry Holt 
&Co. 

The centenary of Edward FitzGerald's birth is 
being commemorated by Messrs. Thomas Y Crowell & 
Company in the publication of a FitzGerald Edition of 
the " Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam." The lettering of 
the text, the page decorations, and the illustrations in 
color are all the work of the Hungarian artist, Willy 
Pogany. 

Mrs. William Sharp's biography of her husband, 
announced some time ago by Messrs. Duffield & Co., 
will not be issued this Autumn, but has been postponed 
until next year. In the meanwhile Mrs. Sharp is busy 
with the collected edition of the works of Fiona Mac- 
leod, two volumes of which will undoubtedly appear 
this Fall. 

Three important books dealing with Socialism are 
announced by Mr. B. W. Huebsch of New York. Chief 
among these is a translation from the German of Edward 
Bernstein's " Evolutionary Socialism : A Criticism and 
Affirmation " ; the other two are ■ The Substance of 
Socialism " and " Karl Marx: His Life and Work," 
both by Mr. John Spargo. 

Popular interest in Mars, aroused by the planet's 
recent opposition, makes timely Professor Percival 
Lowell's latest book, ■ The Evolution of Worlds." In 
this volume, to be published shortly, Professor Lowell 
discuf^s not only the possibility of human beings living 
on Mars, but the whole problem of the beginnings of 
the universe as we see it. 

Dr. William Edgar Geil, author of " The Great Wall 
of China," announced by the Sturgis & Walton Com- 
pany, is starting upon a new expedition into the interior 
of China, one principal object of his trip being to make

[Oct. 1, 



a study of the relation of American and European 
residents in China to Chinese life and to international 
questions and relations. 

Mr. Maxfield Parrish, one of the most popular of 
present-day illustrators, has lately made a series of 
twelve drawings of scenes from the stories of the 
" Arabian Nights," and they will be published this month 
in a book called "The Arabian Nights: Their Best- 
known Tales," edited by Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin 
and Miss Nora Archibald Smith. 

Miss Agnes C. Laut's " Conquest of the Great North- 
west," which has already, in the ten months since its 
publication, made a considerable reputation for its 
author, was purchased by Messrs. Moffat, Yard & 
Company at the sale, last month, of the Outing Com- 
pany's publications. The author is now engaged in 
writing a second work, carrying the story from the 
period thus covered down to measurably modern days. 

Dr. Eliot's much-discussed lecture on that subject of 
perennial interest to all the world, and on which nearly 
all the world holds more or less decided opinions, 
Religion, is published in full in the October number of 
" The Harvard Theological Review." The amount of 
vehement denunciation and warm praise that this latest 
of Dr. Eliot's public utterances has called forth is prob- 
ably inversely proportional to the accuracy of the critic's 
knowledge of what the speaker really said. In a pub- 
lished letter to one of his assailants he mildly remarks: 
" I venture to think that the opinion of the lecture which 
you have formed on the basis of a few inaccurately 
reported scattered sentences out of an address which 
took an hour to read, might be modified if you read the 
full address." 

An old subscriber of the London " Athenaeum " writes 
to deplore the omission from that sterling literary 
journal of the Autumn and Spring lists of forthcoming 
books, which he regards of the greatest value in ena- 
bling readers and students to keep track of the books 
that are expected in their special fields, as well as 
affording a survey of all the various forms of literary 
activities of the approaching book season. Readers of 
The Dial need not be told how carefully this feature 
is covered in its pages — as shown by the extended 
lists in its preceding and present issues; but they can 
have little conception of the labor and care involved in 
collecting the advance information needed and present- 
ing it in proper form. These lists have long been a 
regular and distinctive feature of The Dial, and the 
appreciation of the public satisfies us that the care and 
labor are well expended. 

The publishing rights to a number of important books , 
on the list of The Outing Publishing Company have 
been acquired by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., who will 
hereafter issue the titles over their imprint. These 
include two books of unusual interest which have not 
yet been put on the market, — " The Conquest of the 
Missouri," by Mr. Joseph Mills Hanson, and " Ships and 
Sailors of Old Salem," by Mr. Ralph D. Paine, which 
will be issued at once. The books already published 
include Mr. Clarence E. Mulford's two stories, " Bar 20 " 
and " The Orphan." Mr. Ralph D. Paine's " Greater 
America " and "The Stroke Oar," Zane Grey's "The 
Last of the Plainsmen," Mr. Dillon Wallace's " The 
Long Labrador Trail," and two practical books, Sando's 
" American Poultry Culture " and Massey's " Practical 
Farming." Messrs. McClurg & Co. have also recently 
acquired the publishing rights in Mrs. Katherine Yates's 
well-known Christian Science stories for children. 



Announcements of Fall, Books. 



The length of The Dial's annual list of books

^The 
SILVER 
HORDE 




By ^ 

REX 
BEACH 



Dashing headlong to a triumphant conclusion, this new Beach novel — from the first page 
to the last — has all the sheer power of "The Spoilers" and all the racy humor and sympathy 
of "The Barrier." A background, superb in its silvery romance, is the life-story of the salmon 
— and over it the ominous hand of the fisheries magnates. The hero is a young civil-engineer, 
in love with the daughter of a financier. In search of a fortune sufficient to meet the views of 
her father, he has spent years of hardship in Alaska. When he has almost given up hope, he 
meets Cherry Malotte — the Cherry of "The Spoilers" — all fire and grit and tenderness, and 
the two join forces. Illustrated. Pictorial Cover in Colors. $1.50 

NORTHERN LIGHTS THE REDEMPTION OF 



By SIR GILBERT PARKER 

These stories represent the mature power 
of "The Weavers" and the dramatic action 
of "The Right of Way," coupled with the 
swift, keen, tender impressionism of the early 
work with which the author began his career. 
The tales in this book, in which the charac- 
ters are French-Canadian, English, Amer- 
ican, Indian — the general range of settlement 
people — belong to two different stages. 

Fully Illustrated. Post 8vo, Cloth, $1.50 



KENNETH GALT 

By WILL IN. HARBEN 

The scene is — as it should be — the rural 
Georgia Mr. Harben has made famous. In 
this new novel the author goes still deeper 
into the field of passionate realism. Kenneth 
Gait is brilliant, able, with a theory of life 
which pretty much allows human beings to 
make their own moral laws. The uncon- 
scious power of the novel as a plea for lawful 
living makes the book a very strong one. 

With Frontispiece. Post 8vo, Cloth, $i.5o 



THE MOCCASIN RANCH 



By HAMLIN GARLAND 

The author goes to that West of the Dakotas, the country of his earlier novels, for the scene 
of "The Moccasin Ranch." He takes a man who has made a failure back in Illinois, and his 
young wife, out on the prairie trail, and sets them to make a home in a fresh pine cabin, in a 
lonely country of open skies and mighty winds, far away from civilization. 

Frontispiece. Post 8vo, Cloth, $1.00 

JULIA BRIDE A New Novel by HENRY JAMES 

This is the story — told with simplicity and delicacy — of a girl so beautiful and so splendid 
in the perfection of that beauty that even women stop to admire and wonder and bow down. 
The social comedy was never more clearly or more delightfully put in the pages of a book. 

Post 8vo, Cloth. Illuminated Wrapper. $1.25 

JONATHAN and DAVID By Elizabeth stuart phelps 

This is a simple village story, with an old man's gentle character and affection for his dog 
as the governing motive. It takes hold of the reader by reason of its great sincerity. 
With Illustrations by W. T. Smedley. Pictorial Cover. i6mo, Cloth, 50 cents net

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



A strong and impressive novel for the discriminating lover of literature. 



" Masterly," says 
the Outlook. 

"The book is big, 
a thing of spiritual 
uplift and signifi- 
cance." — Louisville 
Post. 



By MRS. HENRY DUDENEY 

Author of " Folly Corner," " Rachel Lorian," etc. 
$1.25 net; postage, 12 cents. 



"Deserves wide 
reading." — Chicago 
Record-Herald. 

"A powerful novel 
on a great subject." 
— Philadelphia In- 
quirer. 



The work of one of the greatest modern English novelist. Its vivid theme is that situation involving 
two men and one woman which some one has aptly called "the eternal triangle." 

From the first page the reader realizes that he is in the hands of an author of notablepower, and he 
yields to the full measure of the entertainment that the author provides. The development of the story 
is unexpected, and it glows with the dramatic fire of a true masterpiece. 



" It is masterly, a really profound study of motive and char- 
acter. Like ' Tess of the D'Urbervilles,' it deals boldly with the 
problems of passion, and may offend in this way, but, like that 
book also, it is essentially dramatic, a searching exposition of 
human nature under the stress of conflicting emotions." — The 
Outlook. 

" Mrs. Dudeney's books have all shown remarkable strength, 
literary feeling and capacity in the depiction of character. In 
this book she springs lightly, on tiptoe, with a winged step. It 
is a pleasure to read the pastes of this novel, just for the sake of 
the color, the sparkle, the suggestiveness of the sentences." 

— New York Timet. 

" Mrs. Humphry Ward at her best does not surpass this 
work." — Book News Monthly. 

" Possessing that quality of interestingness indispensable to 
a good story, ' Trespass ' has something more ; it goes deeply 
into the great soul of a man to whom nature has denied a great 
body or even a great ambition, yet to whom she has given the 
opportunity to prove himself one of the few lovers that have ever 
existed in the world whose love can withstand every shock, even 
to the faithlessness of the loved one." — Louisville Courier- 
Journal. 

"The story deserves wide reading, because it 's good to know 
a man like little bodied, big souled Stephen." — Chicago Record- 
Herald. 

" ' Trespass ' is a strong story. It is brilliantly written, with 
an analysis of character so keen that the very souls of the three 
who dominate the book are laid bare. The characters are no 
drawing-room puppets, but real men and women. Readers who 
best enjoy this will take a delight in this book. They will read 
each sentence carefully and often lay down the book to let the 
frequently occurring keen things sink into the mind.' ' —Newark 
Call. 



" Mrs. Dudeney's novel has power and vivid emotionalism. 
Strength of line and warmth of color, first one and then the other 
are dominant in ber character painting. The author has a 
barbed wit and a lucid style. She tells a passionate tale in a style 
that is almost passion less ; restraint is a rare virtue, and it makes 
distinctly for power." — St. Paul Dispatch. 

" Mrs. Dudeney, who is one of the foremost of present day 
English novelists, writes with the power of a master. She man- 
ifests a broad and charitable philosophy that gives the thought- 
ful reader a new outlook on life and some of its ever present 
problems. She is an imaginative as well as an original thinker." 

— Springfield Union. 

" Mrs. Dudeney is an artist. Her sincerity, added to style and 
decided cleverness in conversational scenes, has given her a 
strong hold_ on her public, and won for her a place among the 
English writers who are read by thinking men and women. 
' Trespass' is a remarkable picture of English life— full of human 
passion, powerfully dealt with and presented in admirable liter- 
ary form." — Public Ledger. 

" Nothing exactly like this has been seen in fiction. The 
unique thing about ' Trespass ' is Mrs. Dudeney's originality in 
clothing her story with unhackneyed truth and sparkling 
thought. It is a powerful story and it leaves a deep impression 
on the mind of the reader." — Syracuse Post Standard. 

"Seldom has such a theme been treated with so light and yet 
so masterly a touch." — Pittsburgh Post. 

" This powerfully moving romance of passion is quite the 
best thing that has come to our notice from this English author." 

— Duluth Herald. 

" The story is one that can safely be recommended to a friend 
asking for the name of something worth reading." — Boston 
Olobe.

Industry ; Labor ; Government ; Finance ; Education ; Art ; Philanthropy ; Religion . For the sociological study which has received 
so strong an impetus in our day, nothing more apt can be imagined than this thoughtful, illuminating book. And for those who

unique. It is confidently commended to the reading public, both in Providence and elsewhere in America. Illustrated. 374 pages,

THE CAMERALISTS: The Pioneers of German Social Polity By albion w. small 

To readers of English only, cameralism is virtually a lost chapter in the history of the social sciences. Although everything 
now belonging to German polity has a part of its heredity in that type of social theory, not every reputable student of the social 
sciences in America could correctly define the term, and few could name more than one or two writers to whom it is properly applied. 
In this volume there is given to readers of English the first reliable and detailed account of the cameralistic school. 500 pages, 
12mo, cloth ; net $3.00, postpaid $3.18. 

THE ARMENIAN AWAKENING By leon arpee 

This book will be found singularly interesting and appropriate in the light of the occurrences of the past few years. Begin- 
ning with the " Dark Ages " of Armenian history, the author traces the religious attitude and the struggles of this people from 
the time of the introduction of Christianity. It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are familiar with the Armenian 
struggle for religious freedom, that political forces have been a strong factor in the persecution to which this people has been 
periodically subjected. All the sidelights which the condition of European politics could throw on the situation have been employed 
by the author, and his sympathetic treatment leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the various motives for the frequent 
outbreaks against the Armenians which have aroused the Christian world. 240 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.25, postpaid $1.36. 

RESEARCHES IN BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. Vol. II. The HisUrlc Exodus By OLAF A. TOFFTEEN 

This volume deals with the historicity of the Biblical story of the Exodus. In order to set this forth, the author enters into a 
serious examination of the evolutionary hypothesis of modern higher criticism, and then appeals to the monuments, in the light of 
which the Exodus is studied. As the book is written in popular style, easy to grasp at every point, even by the layman who may 
not be versed in technicalities of this kind, it is eminently adapted alike for the religious reader and the student of history. 360 
pages, 8vo, cloth ; net $2.50. postpaid $2.72. 

SOURCE BOOK FOR SOCIAL ORIGINS : Ethnological Materials, Psychological Standpoint, Classified 
and Annotated Bibliographies for the Interpretation of Savage Society By william i. thomas 

The papers forming the body of the book are by such eminent modern anthropologists as Boas, Tyler, Westermarck, Spencer 
and Gillen, Hadden, and Rivers. The author has an introductory chapter on the standpoint from which the materials are to be 
viewed, and critical comments are appended to each part. There are seven parts: (1) External Environment (. Anthropogeography 
and Primitive Economics) : (2) Primitive Mind and Education; (3) Early Marriage; (4) Invention and Technology; 15) Art, Orna- 
ment, and Decoration; (6) Magic, Religion. Ritual, and Ceremonial; (7) Social Organization. Morality, and the State. The extended 
Bibliographies form the chief feature of the book. 920 pages, 8vo, bound in buckram, gold stamped, sewn on tape; net $4.50,

The Red Saint 

LJERE is a "different" book. Every page breathes 
romance — that eternal mystery which makes 
life sweet. A great romantic novel of old England, 
with a plot that fascinates as it discloses vivid scene 
after scene of love, fighting, romance, and pathos. 
It glows with color, with life, and action. You may 
escape loving Denise "The Red Saint " — but it is 
unlikely. 

This romance differs from a familiar type of 
novel in that each of the many characters is a vitally 
human personality. 

The delightful style and charming literary quality 
have completely won the great critics of London, 
who unite in praising this "brilliant piece of work " 
and have grown enthusiastic over "the exciting 
romance," "the exceedingly well devised plot," 
and the "story in which the reader loses himself 
delightedly. " 

Fifth impression of "The Red Saint," by 
Warwick Deeping, now ready. Frontispiece by

in four colore, reproduced direct from the original paintings of the Old Masters. Edited by T. Leman Hare. Large 

8vo, boxed net, $4.00 

This is the largest and most beautiful collection of world famous paintings of children ever collected in a moderate 
priced volume. The illustrations are exquisitely printed in colore, from carefully executed copies of the greatest child 
pictures in the art galleries of Europe. Here is a wonderful opportunity for the lover of art, or the lover of children, to 
possess copies of the court children of Velasquez, the infants of Raphael, the little dukes and duchesses of Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, or Gainsborough, etc., reproduced in a manner which does justice to the matchless drawing and coloring of 
the originals. 

INTIMATE RECOLLECTIONS OF JOSEPH JEFFERSON 

By EUGENIE PAUL JEFFERSON". Profusely illustrated, many of the pictures being from photographs taken by 

Joseph Jefferson. 8vo. cloth net, $3-50 

The universal admiration and love which Joseph Jefferson's life inspired has roused a widespread desire, expressed 
in various ways, to get closer to the real man. to know more of him and of the secret with which he swayed a nation. 
The present volume is an intimate and charming account of Joseph Jefferson's personal side and his home life, written 
by his daughter-in-law. It tells much that no one outside the family circle could tell ; it mentions many things that 
Mr. Jefferson, from feelings of delicacy, or modesty, could hardly have mentioned in his autobiography. Within its 
pages Joseph Jefferson, actor, author, painter, clubman, fisherman, lives again. 

DUTCH NEW YORK 

Manners and Customs of New Amsterdam in the Seventeenth Century. By ESTHER SINGLETON,

showing costumes, furniture, household utensils, dwellings, etc.. of the period. 8vo, cloth. Boxed . net, $3.50 

Here is a book which promises to take a good place among the Holiday Books of the season. The early Dutch 

merchants and patroons lived in much greater comfort and even elegance than any one nowadays but antiquarians 

suppose. Their dress, manners, customs, furniture, cooking utensils, etc., have passed away, yet there are numbers of 

people who would be glad to learn about such things, provided the information could be secured in convenient and 

entertaining form. For such readers Miss Singleton's book will be of great interest and value. She is one of the best 

equipped writers in America on this subject, having already written " Dutch and Flemish Furniture," " Social Life in 

New York under the Georges," and other books on kindred topics. 

TREMENDOUS TRIFLES 

By GILBERT K.CHESTERTON, author of '"Heretics," "Varied Types," "Charles Dickens," etc . . net, 1.20 
Mr. Chesterton is unquestionably one of the most brilliant essayists of the day. He is startlingly original, for his 

ideas are always in opposition to those commonly held ; but no matter how unheard of and startling his hypotheses, he 

can back them up with subtle arguments, flashes of humor, and sheer cleverness until the reader is wholly fascinated. 

He is said to be the most brilliant talker in England ; and as his essays are nothing but written talks, a new volume of 

them will appeal mightily to all literary minded people.

stare. 12mo, cloth net. $1.50

and painstaking work, and it gives the reader a more careful and complete account of the history of each opera, the 
story and the music, than any popular book published. In writing a new volume. Miss Singleton has followed the same 
careful and comprehensive plan in describing the newest operas. As a result this book contains more information about 
the text and the music of such operas as " Salome," " Thais," " Pelleas et Melisande, " etc., than any guide book to the 
opera published.

WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, 

(G. CBl, C. Merriam Co., Springfield, Mass.) surpasses the old International 
as much as that book exceeded its predecessors. On the old foundation a 
new superstructure has been built. The reconstruction has been carried on 
through many years by a large force of trained workers, under the super- 
vision of Dr. W. T. Harris, recent United States Commissioner of Education, 
and reenforced by many eminent specialists. The definitions have been 
rearranged and amplified. The number of terms defined has been more 
than doubled. The etymology, synonyms, pronunciation, have received 
unsparing scholarly labor. The language of English literature for over seven 
centuries, the terminology of the arts and sciences, and the every-day speech 
of street, shop, and household, are presented with fullness and clearness. 
In size of vocabulary, in richness of general information, and in convenience 
of consultation, the book sets a new mark in lexicography.

ROBERT HICHENS' 



Greatest Novel 



BELLA 
DONNA 




MR. HICHENS, in his new novel, has returned to the region of his greatest triumph, Africa, and 
set his scenes on the Egyptian desert, and in the wonderful Valley of the Nile. C." Bella Donna " 
is infinitely more human than "The Garden of Allah," and the Egyptian setting is one peculiarly 
suited to Mr. Hichens' extraordinary talent. It is a powerful drama — a contest between materialism 
and idealism, between a man who loves the soul and a woman who adores the body.

The Bretons at Home

Brittany from his list as containing nothing with which he is not now familiar after an introduction so ample."

THE REVIVAL OF PAGEANTRY. 



The academic suburb of Chicago known by 
the name of Evanston has not hitherto been 
thought of as a focus of romantic possibilities. 
Known far and wide as a community in which 
sober and godly lives are led, as a university 
town in which the student of divinity tempers 
by his decorous example the riotous instincts 
of the normal barbarian collegian, as a burgh 
propped by the moral bulwarks of prohibition 
and Methodism, Evanston has long been the 
symbol of the prosaic and the pedestrian. It is 
true that a pestilent beast popularly styled the 
" blind pig " ( Sus ccbcus) has been thought to 
infest its obscurer regions, and has even, report 
says, been tracked to its lair by expeditions of 
zealous zoologists ; but all this may be only a 
fable, devised by those malicious minds that are 
always impelled to detraction by the spectacle 
of the upright and the exemplary. But the 
Evanston of these latter days has taken on a 
riot of color and spectacular effect that has made 
its more staid inhabitants rub their eyes with 
wonder at this unprecedented blossoming of 
artistic fancy. To speak plainly, there has been 
revealed in those parts a pageant of the historical 
Northwest, judiciously mingled with devices for 
enticing shy coins from their hiding-places (in 
the sweet name of charity), and graciously 
countenanced and even abetted by the best 
suburban society. Already the modest town 
is being styled the American Bayreuth, and is 
bearing its new honors with the proud conscious- 
ness that they have been deserved. 

In the matters of picturesque stage-setting 
and poetical effect, the pageant has been in the 
capable hands of Mr. Donald Robertson and 
Mr. Thomas Wood Stevens, whose quality in 
this sort was exhibited last spring when the 
Renaissance pageant was given at the Art 
Institute of Chicago. Such poetry as Mr. 
Stevens knows how to write for an affair like 
this, recited with Mr. Robertson's art, goes far 
toward redeeming the inevitable amateurishness 
of such a performance. Nor is material lacking 
in the history of the great Northwest. We are 
the heirs of a romantic tradition which begins 
with the French seekers for the South Sea, goes 
on with the dissolving view of a French trans- 
formed into an English civilization, includes

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



the heroic exploit of George Rogers Clark, and 
comes down to things as diversely interesting as 
the Blackhawk War and the Wigwam that made 
the fortunes of President Lincoln. A sequence 
that includes, besides Clark and Lincoln, such 
men as Marquette, La Salle, Tonty,and Pontiac, 
that makes us acquainted with explorers and 
saints, with the heroes of both military and civic 
life, is anything but poverty-stricken in its ap-' 
peal to the imagination. 

How admirably Mr. Stevens has put his ma- 
terial to poetic use may be illustrated by the 
following quotation : 

" Peaceful the Black-Gown came, we welcomed him. 
He taught his faith; we listened and we loved, 
For he was patient, brave, and kind. He lives 
In drowsy annals of our winter nights. 
But those who followed in the Black-Gown's trail 
Brought harsher magic and a hopeless war. 
Seeking the paths that we had never trod 
They searched the blue horizons for some grim 
And desolate issue to forbidden seas; 
They spoke to us of mysteries, shoulder-wise 
As they with tireless footsteps hastened on. 

La Salle, and Tonty of the Iron Hand, 
Great Captains in this idle paleface quest, 
Came hither long ago, and claimed the ground 
For some old king beyond the sunrise. These 
Were strong-heart men, these finders of the way 
Who hunted the great rivers to their ends, — 
Stern foes, whom fear could never shake. Behold 
Wan children of the sheltered lodges, these 
Who faced the mystery with dauntless eyes 
And trod our trails out with intrepid feet, 
The Captains of the white man's outer march." 

The Evanston pageant has been, of course, 
but a small affair in comparison with the recent 
doings on the Hudson River and Lake Cham- 
plain, or with last year's superb commemoration 
of the founding of Quebec. But it has its place 
in the series of recent demonstrations that 
have sought to realize the past for a generation 
which seems suddenly to have been aroused to 
the consciousness that the American past is by 
no means contemptible from the romantic point 
of view. The annals of early America have 
seemed dull only because their possibilities were 
long unrealized ; they have had to wait until 
our own time for the significant expression that 
gives color and vitality to the annals of any age. 
For the unfolding of their charms our chief 
debt is due to Parkman, who first brought us to 
understand how magnificent a drama had been 
enacted upon this new-world stage. But many 
others have also helped to vivify our historical 
inheritance, until we have at last come to view 
it with new insight, and to know that the old 
world by no means has a monopoly of thrilling 
situations and romantic happenings. 



The historical pageant has a highly important 
educational function, and we are glad that its 
possibilities have become so generally apparent. 
Modern education knows how important it is to 
quicken the understanding by bringing the eye 
to its aid. We sometimes go too far in this 
respect, no doubt, forgetting that vision is only 
an adjunct to intelligence, and by no means a 
substitute therefor. To many people the read- 
ing of newspapers has come to be a scanning of 
cuts and head-lines only, and to many children 
the pictures in their school-books prove so dis- 
tracting that the text is slighted. Excessive 
attention to the pictorial aspect of an historical 
theme tends to produce flabbiness of mind, en- 
couraging indolent receptivity at the expense of 
sharp intellectual reaction. But the picture or 
the spectacle, taken in its properly subordinated 
relation to the fact or the idea, may aid marvel- 
lously in bringing the latter home. The pageant, 
which is primarily a series of moving pictures, 
is calculated to stir the most lethargic mind to 
interest. The symbols of the printed page be- 
come matters of real human concern when thus 
informed with life. And when nature lends a 
hand, as in the case of the Hudson River and 
the Rock of Quebec, supplying the actual scenes 
where great deeds were once wrought, the spec- 
tacle of the pageant acquires an impressiveness 
of which the depth and the enduring character 
are not easily to be measured. It is well that 
men should from time to time be made to feel 
how firmly the present is linked with the past ; 
f orgetf ulness of this fact constitutes perhaps the 
chief danger of our restless modern life. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Extraneous aids to literary production, as 
we find them adopted by various celebrated authors, 
often provoke a smile of amusement, so very like to 
solemn fooling do they seem. Dickens is said to 
have sought inspiration from a number of quaint 
little bronze figures that he kept on his writing-table. 
Ibsen maintained a similar company of puppets. 
Bulwer Lytton had to clothe himself in fine array 
before the muse would visit him, whereas Mr. 
Thomas Hardy is reported as finding the removal 
of footgear conducive to a free flow of ideas. The 
Hungarian novelist Jdkai was reduced to sterility 
and despair whenever his supply of violet ink gave 
out, and all the world knows that the philosopher 
Kant was so troubled when the trees grew to such a 
height as to hide an old tower on which he had been 
wont to fix his gaze in moods of metaphysical specu- 
lation, that he was forced to request the cutting away 
of the obstructive foliage. Malebranche, Hobbes,

and Corneille required a penumbra for the incuba- 
tion of their ideas, and were wont to darken their 
studies in the daytime. Zola also pulled down the 
blinds, but at the same time turned on the gas jets 
and flooded his room with artificial light, having in 
his struggling days been in the habit of writing far 
into the night, so that daylight had become disso- 
ciated with literary work. Richter, on the other 
hand, and Ouida wrote best in the radiance of the 
early morning sun and in the open air. Gray in- 
voked the muse with a page or two of Spenser. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes needed to feel a pen in his 
hand, as a sort of conductor of ideas, before his verse 
or prose would flow. Miss Carolyn Wells has indi- 
cated the various kinds of candy that may be appro- 
priately indulged in as a prelude to various kinds of 
literary effort. Dr. Johnson, while writing his 
dictionary, derived assistance from orange peel and 
tea, while the purring of a cat on his table was a 
further aid. Sheridan liked to have a bottle of good 
wine beside him as he wrote, and in this he was not 
peculiar; but he also required the stimulus of brilliant 
lights all about him. Douglas Jerrold tolerated no 
litter on his desk ; all was immaculate there, his ink- 
stand resting in a marble shell, and his little dog 
curled up at his feet. Sardou always wrote his plays 
first on little scraps of paper, then on foolscap. 
Milton and Warburton shared the same peculiarity, 
a fondness for organ strains as the best means to 
induce the mood for high literary endeavor. Buffon 
scorned all meretricious aids, his desk and chair and 
writing materials being the sole furnishings of his 
study. Thus it appears that the would-be great 
writer can hardly go wrong in choosing his method 
of work. Whatever oddity or commonplaceness he 
adopts, he is pretty sure to find distinguished 
precedent for his choice. 

The faculty of idiom-making — or, as some 
might differently express it, a genius for slang — is 
quite extensively credited to Americans, and not 
unjustly. What other language tban our own 
" American-English " can show anything to com- 
pare with the breezy freedom and picturesque apt- 
ness of some of our western idioms, and with the 
homely and concise expressiveness of our Yankee- 
isms ? The Manchester u Guardian," commenting 
on this subject, acknowledges the English indebted- 
ness to America. " Lately we have become very 
apt pupils of American phrase-makers." it says. "It 
is almost good colloquial English to say that a thing 
is ' up to so-and-so,' meaning tbat it is so-and-so's 
concern. Even as an Americanism we believe this 
phrase is fairly recent. Almost as freely we speak 
of a person as being ' up against ' an obstacle or an 
opponent — a very expressive phrase with no ade- 
quate equivalent in elegant English. . . . Our recent 
readiness to adopt Americanisms is not an unhealthy 
tendency if we adopt them not as mere novelties in 
slang, but for the sake of their liveliness and force. 
Perhaps it would be a still healthier sign to make a 
few new idioms for ourselves." In somewhat differ- 



ent vein, and betraying less accurate information, a 
writer in the London '• Nation " comments on our 
supposed use of * I swan." " I frequently ask my 
American friends," says this writer, "if they can give 

i the derivation of ' I swan,' and never yet have I 
heard even an attempt to do so. Fifty years ago ' I 

i swan ' was in regular use by poets and novelists, and 
to-day it is employed in current American speech, 
though a certain class of Americans seem to find it 
necessary to apologize for the use of what they think 
is slang." Then we are confidently assured that it 
is not slang, but merely a corruption of " I warrant 
you," through " I'se warrant," " A's warn," of the 
Liddesdale farmer. Thus what has been considered 
a bit of Yankee slang turns out to be an idiom of the 
Scottish border that " fifty years ago . . . was in 
regular use by poets and novelists." Henceforth, 
our polite circles of Boston, or Chicago, or Kalama- 
zoo, or any other centre of refinement and culture, 
may feel at liberty to continue the daily use of " I 
swan," but with no longer any need of the hitherto 
customary apology. What a relief ! 

The libraby of a big-game hunter in Africa 
might fairly be expected to abound in the literature 
of the chase, and it was doubtless with such expec- 
tations that many readers of Mr. Roosevelt's African 
article in the current " Scribner's Magazine " turned 
to the catalogue of the " Pigskin Library " at its 
close. But there is not a trace of any such litera- 
ture to be found in the fifty-three works chosen by 
the ex-President and his son to solace their idle 
hours in the tropic wilds. Apart from Mark Twain's 
u Tom Sawyer" and M Huckleberry Finn," and some 
of Scott's, Poe's, Bret Harte's, and Cooper's fiction, 
the selections appear to represent the father's rather 
than the son's literary likings ; and these likings are 
well known to be catholic and comprehensive. It 
is a little surprising, however, omnivorous though 
Mr. Roosevelt is in his reading, to see him carrying 
all the way to East Africa the apocryphal portions 
of the Bible, and Carlyle's *• Frederick the Great," 
as well as Gregorovius's " Rome," Spenser's * Faerie 
Queene," Dante's M Inferno," and "La Chanson de 
Roland." But on the whole he has with him a very 
inviting company of the world's best authors, and 
more of them than most of us will get time to look 
into within the period of this famous hunting excur- 
sion. " The Pigskin Library," edited by Theodore 
Roosevelt might not be a bad venture for some 
enterprising publisher, especially if he could an- 
nounce the volumes as bound in skins of the distin- 
guished editor's own procuring.

Engineering and the classics are declared by 
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, a prominent member of 
the American Institute of Civil Engineers, which 
recently held its annual convention, to be not so 
mutually hostile as many have imagined. He main- 
tains that the general educational training necessary 
for handling the problems of modern life is much the 
same for every profession, and that the engineer

valuable for the engineer, and as obtainable in no 
other way so well as by the safe and sure road long 
ago unwittingly built for generations of unborn 
schoolboys by Nepos, Caesar, Xenophon, & Co. The 
engineer's work, moreover, it is argued, tends to 
make him one-sided and narrow-minded, and he 
needs the corrective influence of the so-called cul- 
tural studies to enlarge his view. A further reason 
why he should be a classical scholar is found in the 
great and rapidly increasing number of scientific 
terms derived from the Greek, and, to a less extent, 
from the Latin. It is a pleasing picture we seem 
to get from this broad-minded man of science, of 
the liberally educated civil engineer, his theodolite 
over his shoulder and his Theocritus under his arm, 
pursuing his calling with outlook extending far 
beyond his measuring chain, and ideas too large to be 
expressed in the figures jotted down in his note-book. 
Of course Dr. Steinmetz is not the first one, and we 
hope he will not be the last, to emphasize the desir- 
ability of being a whole man before becoming either 
an engineer or a statesman, an orator or a poet, a 
mechanic or a millionaire. 

A SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO " THE ART AND 

Science of Advertising," Mr. George French's 
instructive book recently reviewed by us, is suggested 
by the ingenious scheme of a St. Louis manufacturer 
to get his name before the public. Noting with 
regret that " old-fashioned chivalry toward women " 
is rapidly declining in his own city, and that the 
decline is even more precipitate in New York and 
Chicago, this trans-Mississippi champion of the 
weaker sex is distributing " true-blue buttons," which 
will indicate to any woman entering a street-car that 
the wearer of such button is a pattern of chivalry 
and is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to prove it 
by resigning to her his seat, if he has one. A speedy 
cure to bad manners is all but guaranteed to any 
man who will wear the button for a week : " he 
will become fixed in old-fashioned chivalry toward 
women " — and at the same time the manufacturer's 
name, displayed on the button, will become fixed in 
the minds of numerous observers. Thus are we 
taught a neat little lesson in the difficult art not only 
of advertising, but also of worshipping both manners 
and mammon at the same time — of killing two birds 
with one button, so to speak.

The National Education Association of the 
United States is a large and influential organization, 
with manifold activities and great powers for good. 
It has many departments for special work, among 
which the Library Department has had considerable 
prominence, as affording opportunities for teachers 
and librarians to get together and discuss matters 
of practical concern to both classes of workers in the 
broad field of public instruction. Now that this 



Library Department has grown from its small begin- 
nings in 1896, until its meetings have become among 
the most interesting and best attended of all the 
departments of the Education Association, it seems 
a pity that it should be abolished, as has been pro- 
posed by the Executive Committee of the Associa- 
tion, in its plans for reorganization. The object, of 
course, is to simplify the affairs and proceedings of 
the Association ; but it seems as if this might be 
done in some better way. Not unnaturally, the 
librarians of the country are opposing the action, 
and pleading for a stay of proceedings until they 
can present their side of the question. It is to be 
hoped that their arguments will receive a careful 
hearing. This branch of educational work is more 
distinctive, and certainly not less important, than 
many others that are allowed to continue the enjoy- 
ment of old-time privileges in the councils of the 
Association. . . • 

A distinguished promoter of the art of 
printing, Robert Hoe, head of the firm of R. Hoe 
& Co., and perfecter of the marvellous sextuple 
cylinder machine that prints, cuts, pastes, folds, 
counts, 1 and delivers from twenty-four thousand to 
seventy-two thousand newspapers an hour, according 
to the number of pages in each copy, died in London 
a few weeks ago, at the age of seventy. His service 
to the cause of letters in helping to make possible 
the cheap and voluminous modern newspaper, includ- 
ing its colored supplement, may be of questionable 
value ; but his ingenuity and energy cannot fail to 
win our admiration. Besides being an inventor and 
a conspicuously successful business man, he was a 
writer on the history and development of printing, 
and also a collector of early books and other rare 
specimens of primitive printing. This collection is 
said to be worth as much as a million dollars. Mr. 
Hoe had the quietness and unobtrusiveness of the 
man of deeds rather than words, but a few of his 
words of wisdom have gained currency; as, for 
example, " Concentration is the first condition of 
success," and " Get behind a thing and push it ; 
don't put yourself in front and pull." 

Chicago's civil-service selection of a libra- 
rian, the exact method of which has already been 
explained by us, was made public on the first of 
the month. Mr. Henry E. Legler, secretary of the 
Wisconsin Free Library Commission, and president 
of the publishing board, of the executive board, and 
of the national council of the American Library Asso- 
ciation, is the successful candidate. He has accepted 
the call, as was of course to be expected from his 
consenting to enter the competition. Mr. Legler is 
an Italian by birth, a Swiss by early education, but 
an American by later school-training and by subse- 
quent residence and professional activity in this 
country. Before taking up library work he tried 
his hand not unsuccessfully at journalism, including 
the mechanical details of printing, at politics (he was 
elected to the Wisconsin legislature in 1889), and 
at public school committee-work ; and he has also

produced a number of biographical and historical 
works, besides writing of late on library matters. 
He is in the prime of middle life, and is regarded 
by those who know him as exceptionally well-fitted 
for his high office. It is interesting to note that the 
accepted candidate lacks a library-school training, 
and has never even served behind a delivery desk 
or as the presiding genius of a reference room. But 
he proved his aptitude for library administration 
when, as member of the Milwaukee school board, he 
instituted the close cooperation between schools and 
the library which has since served as a model for 
other cities. " Library extension," it seems, is to be 
the watchword of the new library administration in 
Chicago. 

O • • • 

Glittering gems of caustic criticism, from 
the mordant pen of George Meredith, long a 
" reader " to the publishing house of Chapman and 
Hall, have been exhumed from the dark unfathomed 
caves of the firm's business records, and are given 
a setting in the pages of " The Fortnightly Review." 
A few of these brilliants we venture to display. " A 
mere wisp of a tale " is the sufficient condemna- 
tion of one unlucky manuscript; "vaporish stuff," 
that of another. "Anstey might have made the 
subject amusing. This writer is an elephant," »uns 
still a third merciless verdict. " Might gain a prize 
for dulness ;" " Feebler stuff than this might be 
written, but would tax an ape ;" " Written in a queer 
old maundering style ; poor stuff, respectable in the 
mouth of one's grandmother ;" " An infernal ro- 
mance ;" " Cockneyish dialogue, gutter English, ill- 
contrived incidents, done in daubs," — thus are the 
hopes of various unnamed literary aspirants blasted, 
for the time being, by this hard-hearted reader. 
His own sensitiveness to adverse criticism is a signi- 
ficant fact in this connection, — so often is the 
highest power to sting united with the keenest 
susceptibility of pricks from hostile shafts. 

Rural appreciation of good literature 
is made the subject of a recent newspaper editorial, 
and the query is offered whether urban sophistication 
does not " quench the thirst for the Muse." The 
simple life of the country and the reading of good 
old books do seem to go well together. " We know 
of one typical bookcase," proceeds the writer already 
quoted, " in a hamlet far from the railroad, wherein 
at least half the books are volumes of poetry. We 
give the list as they stood upon the shelf : Matthew 
Arnold, Whittier, Longfellow, Browning, John G. 
Saxe, Mrs. Browning, Scott, Tennyson, George Eliot, 
Goldsmith, Mrs. Hemans, Milton, Dryden, Will 
Carleton, Coleridge, Alice and Pboebe Cary, and 
Holmes. The range is perhaps the best thing about 
this list. And the books are not mere mural decora- 
tion ; they are well-thumbed." The writer also takes 
pleasure in recalling '' an actual farmer " who re- 
marked : " No more books for me in hayin' time. I 
was readin' • Last o' th' Mohicans ' last summer, an' 
I could n't hardly stop to get m' hay in." We too 



can recall " an actual farmer " who was a reader of 
books, but whose taste was a grade higher than that 
of this Cooper enthusiast. Shakespeare and Scott 
were our farmer's favorites, and he sat up nights, in 
the winter, to read his well-worn editions of their 
works. 

The happy fortunes of Dr. George Brandes 
— not the sad fortunes that have been going the 
rounds of the newspapers for the benefit of credu- 
lous readers — should cause his friends and admirers 
to rejoice. In a letter to the editor who lately pub- 
lished the amazing myth of his unsuccess and impe- 
cuniosity, he writes to contradict the various false 
statements and to declare himself on the best of 
terms with his publishers and the reading world. He 
says, among other things : " I have been fortunate 
in finding a large public for my works both at home 
and abroad. A number of my thirty different 
volumes have been issued in many separate editions, 
and of my recently collected works six thousand sets 
have already been sold. . . . My collected works 
have appeared in Russia in several editions, and of 
my ' Life of Shakespeare ' several thousand copies 
have been sold in England and America, where it 
seems to have become, in a way, a standard work." 
On the whole, then, any movement to pass round 
the hat for this distinguished Danish writer's benefit 
may now be suspended as premature and needless. 

Special library bindings for popular books 
are doubtless advisable on the score of both economy 
and appearance. Mr. Le Roy Jeffers, head of the 
order department of the New York Public Library, 
has prepared an extensive " Reference List of Titles 
Suggested for a Special Library Binding," which is 
already " in active use in 180 of the largest libraries 
in the country." The issue of some of these books 
in more than one edition, at different prices, is care- 
fully noted, and every effort has apparently been 
made to render the list serviceable. Fiction natur- 
ally predominates, with poetry and other polite liter- 
ature in second place. Some little arbitrariness of 
choice cannot but occur, as, for example, the inclu- 
sion of twenty-nine of Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey's 
novels, and the exclusion of all of Mr. William E. 
Norris's. The list fills a pamphlet of 125 pages. 

Cramming the mind with poetry is not exactly 
the best way, one would think, to induce a love of 
poetry, when there is no urgent craving to start with. 
Nevertheless a recent graduate of Harvard, deplor- 
ing the modern utilitarian and scientific trend of 
college education, thus frankly expresses his sense 
of a lack in his own academic training : " If they 
had only crowded more poetry into my system while 
I was in college, there might have been some left in 
me now." With the inauguration of President 
Lowell this month as head of Harvard University 
the hope is finding expression that some return to 
the old system of prescribed " humanities " may be 
effected.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



ON TEACHING LITERATURE. 

BY ONE WHO TRIES TO TEACH IT. 



Why does not some one ask, Can science be 
taught ? It is presumably superior to literature for 
this purpose, because it is a body of fairly definite 
ascertained facts and more or less tenable theories. 
But these are things to be told ; and is telling teach- 
ing ? Where are all the fine old implications of the 
word, if any man who has found out something by 
study may become a teacher by telling what he has 
found ? Should not teaching still be the counterpart 
of learning rather than of study ? And whereas we 
acquire knowledge, we learn wisdom. On this 
ground may we not reasonably hold that literature, 
which is the depository of human wisdom, is emi- 
nently the teacher's field? 

We have heard the objections. There are the 
Knowledges, and there are the Arts, and for the rest 
there is moonshine; and to talk of teaching being 
anything else than imparting either knowledge or 
skill is to talk nonsense. But before we consider 
this, let us put aside all suspicion of quibbling. Let 
us make the word " teach " as broad as anyone 
pleases ; admit that to impart knowledge is to teach 
it (and the pupil also) ; consider even that he who 
does no more than set pupils a task and use physi- 
cal measures to see that they perforin it, is also a 
teacher. Or, better still, let us omit the word from 
the statement of the problem. Then the question 
becomes simply : Can we in the schools do anything 
at all with literature ? and is it worth while ? 

Curiously enough, the greatest sceptics would 
appear to be among those who have the cause of 
letters most at heart. Perhaps their own acquaint- 
ance was made in solitude, and they cannot brook 
the idea of a formal introduction to the wayward 
Muse. Or perhaps they have seen the introduction 
attempted by one who was chiefly interested in the 
cut of the Muse's clothes. " Now this classic knot 
was tied by Boileau ; and you shall see pretty soon 
where that starched ruff came from." These things 
are so clear when they are once seen, and so easily 
communicable. And how boundless the field that 
is opened ! Think what discoveries may be made ! 
We know now that the germs of " Paradise Lost " 
are in Caedmon, Andreini, and Vondel ; literary par- 
allels make it certain that Wordsworth sometimes 
composed with his eye on a book ; we find that in 
earliest Roman art and letters the wheel of Fortune 
did not revolve ; we are almost certain that the orig- 
inal goose honked high, and we may hope some day 
to identify the goose. 

But literature must not be held responsible for all 
the diversions practised in its name. Doubtless all 
things are at times sadly enough mistaught. Litera- 
ture suffers especially, because of its comprehensive- 
ness and vague definition. On the one hand it is a 
thing of record, a body of accumulated material whose 
medium is language ; and language has a continu- 
ous life-history, falling, like other living things, into 
orders and families, into genera and species. To the 



philologist who conducts his investigations in this 
field in a sanely historical and scientific spirit, all 
honor is due, and literature is under deep obligations 
to him, — though the philologist, I conceive, is not 
primarily either a student or teacher of literature. 
On the other hand, literature is in itself an art, even 
in considerable measure a craft; and everybody 
admits that a craft can be taught. As a matter of 
fact, the craft of letters in its humbler aspect is 
daily taught to thousands of students of English com- 
position. But this again is not what is meant. The 
field of contention is that existing body of classical 
literature, imaginative and (as the phrase of simpler 
days has it) inspired, which no one has the temerity 
to attempt to teach as an art, and into which the 
curious incursions of the philologist seem often so 
pitifully inept. Here is the shadowy middle ground — 
the misty mid-region of Weir — where our profes- 
sors of literature would take their stand and pose 
as high priests of the holy of holies. Very natur- 
ally, those who are already endowed with the faculty 
to understand want no such intervention. When they 
can listen to the Prophet, shall the Professor speak ? 

Yet here the Professor finds his vocation. For 
the generously endowed appear to be few. Of 
course those, on the other hand, who are quite 
incapable of instruction, must, as in everything else, 
be passed by. But human faculties are not strati- 
fied ; they rise and sink in an infinite scale. Some 
men mount by native impulse to the highest and 
best in life and art ; others climb by painful degrees. 
And while some of these latter might attain in the 
end by their own efforts, with help they will surely 
attain the sooner. And many may catch some sight 
of the goal who would never have done so unaided. 

Understanding is a necessary condition of all 
enjoyment above the sensual rank, and the under- 
standing is always open to assistance. At the very 
approach to literature, if it be in any degree subtle, 
abstruse, or archaic, there is the bar of inadequate 
knowledge. Many who are competent to enjoy are 
not yet able to read ; and they must be instructed. 
Take the case of the archaic. Experience shows how 
hard it is for the uninstructed to divest any word in 
their vocabulary of the meaning which it has always 
borne to them. My class in the Mort Darthur reads : 

"It seemeth me, said Sir Launcelot, this siege [chair] 
ought to be fulfilled this same day, for this is the feast of 
Pentecost after the four hundred and four and fifty year ; 
and if it would please all parties, I would none of these letters 
were seen this day, till he be come that ought to achieve 
this adventure. Then made they to ordain a cloth of silk 
for to cover these letters in the siege perilous." 

Immediately I discover that they think the word 
"fulfil" refers to the prophecy that is about to be 
fulfilled, — though Malory meant merely that the 
chair would be filled, or find its rightful occupant. 
And the cloth of silk which was " ordained " under- 
went, they imagine, some kind of ceremony or con- 
secration ; whereas it was simply ordered to be made, 
in all probability by some needlewoman. It requires 
a discourse of considerable length — on feudalism, 
on chivalry, and on Old- World social distinctions — 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



277 



to remove from the minds of the unacquainted their 
false conception of Spenser's " gentle knight " and 
substitute the true one. Few but teachers know how 
very far Shakespeare's language is from being 
modern, and how very far therefore the ordinary 
reader is from really understanding him. Suppose 
you who love your Shakespeare without studying 
him attempt to read some passage to a Shakespearian 
student and see how quickly he will find you astray. 
Even Charles Lamb begins to require elucidation. 
Only those who are content to enjoy with a partial 
understanding will maintain that there is no office 
here for the skilled interpreter. Nor is it the office 
of merely philological explanation. The philologist, 
with his exact science of forms and constructions, 
his etymologies and syntaxes, holds a somewhat 
separate ground from that of the interpreter, who 
applies to the subtle meanings of words, and the 
individual colorings they acquire, tests of a very dif- 
ferent order. Yet if any philologist were disposed to 
be jealous of this distinction — as I think none would 
be — we may be content to resign this part of the 
field entirely into his hands, to be called by his own 
name. The point is that there is an abundance of 
work to do here in merely laying the approaches to 
literature ; and it might well occupy the major part 
of some years of elementary instruction. 

A step beyond this is the service of telling another 
what to look for. You listen to a lecture by a geol- 
ogist who discourses of valley formations, — how 
this narrow steep-sided canyon has been formed by 
erosion, how those long straight parallel valleys are 
the result of faulting, how this other broad level- 
floored vale is in reality a silted-up lake, — and the 
next time you go to the mountains your old haunts 
take on a novel interest, because you have been told 
what to see. Why should such instruction be grate- 
fully received from the scientist and not from the 
teacher of literature? A pupil of mine calls atten- 
tion to the fact that a line in Spenser has caught 
his fancy — the line in which Sans joy, having been 
miraculously delivered from the Redcross Knight, 

" Lay covered with inchaunted cloud all day." 
Straightway the line, which I had often passed over 
without notice, takes on for me too a certain lin- 
gering charm. Perhaps I in turn can communicate 
something of the impression always left on my 
imagination by the conclusion of the ballad of Sir 
Patrick Spens, — that picture, drawn at a stroke, of 
the eternal burial-place beneath the sea, where, half 
over to Aberdour, the faithful master and his men 
went down in fifty fathoms of water: 

" And thair lies guid Sir Patrick Spens, 
Wi 1 the Scots lords at his feit." 

Or perhaps I can give an added emphasis to the 
example, in the same ballad, of duty heroically per- 
formed, by showing that Sir Patrick, — who, after 
exclaiming against the rigor of the king's order in 
sending him to sea in the stormy season, goes never- 
theless, — is doing precisely as the three hundred did 
at Balaclava, whom Tennyson has commemorated 
with more elaborate circumstance in his u Was there 



a man dismayed ? " and " Theirs not to make reply." 
I take up the play of "Julius Caesar," and am trans- 
ported in imagination to the time and scene of one of 
the greatest crises in history; and as I am hurried 
along through the warring forces of the wavering 
ambition of Caesar, the fanatic patriotism of Brutus, 
and the fatuous fickleness of the mob, the sense of a 
crumbling state grows upon me until it seems as if 
the very world were toppling to its ruin. May I not 
try to impart something of this sense to another who, 
it may be, has as yet seen in the drama only some 
pretty stage effects and some rhetorical speeches? 
If it still be argued that this is only to tell, — to tell 
what I have seen or felt, — and not yet to teach in 
any such high sense as was hinted at in the begin- 
ning, I would reply that the service does not end 
here. For there is stimulus in seeing what another 
has seen, incentive to see also for one's self. So 
your scientist, communicating only what he has 
learned from another, coldly handing on certain 
elements of common knowledge, may pass for a 
teacher; but when, after patient research, he has 
made his own discoveries, he is in a position to 
assume the priestly office ; and if, by the confidence 
and enthusiasm of his communication, he can impart 
to another the same zeal, inspiring him to go and do 
likewise, then, and perhaps only then, has he really 
read his title clear. For to communicate the en- 
thusiasm for understanding, for discovery, and for 
growth, is, in intellectual matters, one of the highest 
functions of the teacher, and it is a function as surely 
exercisable in the field of letters as in any field under 
the sun. 

Let us go yet a step further. Since great litera- 
ture is wrought of the very substance of life, it has 
in it the elements of ultimate truth and becomes of 
universal import. And the difference between know- 
ledge and wisdom, I take it, is the difference between 
knowing truths and seeing truth, between knowing 
facts and understanding life. To dwell, therefore, 
upon this aspect of literature is only less instructive 
than to observe life itself. For looking on is a part 
of experience ; and to look on in imagination, when 
the imagination is sufficiently sharpened, does not 
differ very materially from looking on in fact. In 
all such literature, then, as is fundamentally a criti- 
cism of life, the teacher finds his greatest oppor- 
tunity. Being by both experience and study more 
deeply versed in life than his pupils, he is in a posi- 
tion to assist them more rapidly to something of the 
same insight and sympathy. It may be that few 
pupils who have not themselves passed middle age 
can comprehend what insight there is in Words- 
worth's simple and touching description of the aging 
couple in the poem of " Michael " over whom many 
seasons of domestic toil have passed, leaving them 

" neither gay perhaps, 
Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes, 
Living a life of eager industry." 

Yet Wordsworth had attained to this insight before 
thirty ; and at the very least, some sense of it may 
be so infixed in the pupil's memory that when he 



278 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



arrives at the stage of comprehension it will recur 
to him with accrued beauty and power. There is no 
need to argue the possibility of bringing home to any 
ordinarily susceptible sensibilities, young or old, the 
noble despair of Mark Antony : 

" Hark ! the land bids me tread no more upon 't ; 
It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither ; 
I am so lated in the world that I 
Have lost ray way for ever ; " 

or the equally noble stoicism of Octavius giving 
counsel to his sister — counsel little suited to any 
woman but a Roman : 

" Cheer your heart : 

Be you not troubled with the time, which drives 

O'er your content these strong necessities ; 

But let determined things to destiny 

Hold unbewail'd their way." 

Deeper criticism of life . than this it is not easy to 
conceive. And suppose it be admitted that in set- 
ting forth these things the teacher is performing only 
the office of a showman ; with such contents of his 
show-box he is a showman glorified. That it is use- 
less to thrust them before the eyes of those who 
would not see them for themselves, I personally can- 
not for a moment admit ; I know too well how much 
I am myself indebted to two or three genuine 
teachers of literature. The service can be done. 
Into any discussion of whether it is worth doing, I 
refuse to go. 

The above was suggested by the title of Mr. 
Charles Leonard Moore's article in The Dial,* and 
was written before that article was read. Now that 
I read it I am glad to see that it does not contain so 
much dissent as I had half expected to find. Of course 
Mr. Moore has his caveats, as we all have. " But," 
runs one in the very first sentence, " to teach litera- 
ture is a good deal like trying to teach life itself." 
Just so. Yet this is precisely what the world's 
greatest teachers have tried to do ; when I spoke of 
the fine old implications of the word, I had in mind 
nothing other than this. Nor do I think Mr. Moore 
means to imply the impossibility of it, but only the 
difficulty. We know it will be imperfectly done. 
Teaching is no sufficient substitute for experience. 
It may, however, be a valuable supplement, — other- 
wise it were folly for the world to hoard its wisdom. 
Rasselas will not always listen to Imlac, remaining 
forever in the Happy Valley; but when he goes 
forth to explore the world, he does well to take the 
sage along. 

*' Absolute realization, transcendent power," says 
Mr. Moore again, " are the main goals of literature." 
And sometimes, indeed, in the hands of the masters, 
the goals seem nearly reached, the realization all 
but absolute. To a realization of this realization I 
have insisted that many can be brought by the simple 
means of human help. To me this is almost axio- 
matic ; and on the subject of method I prefer to 
remain silent. I judge that we who teach are not 
always nearly so much concerned with method as 
others think we must be; in this field especially

am I distrustful of those who advance any very defi- 
nite preconceived method. And indeed Mr. Moore, 
after setting forth so alluringly his own air-drawn 
method, dismisses it with a touch of pleasant irony 
that discloses a like distrust.

COMMUNICA TION. 



TEACHING A LOVE OF LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Mr. Moore's interesting article " On Teaching Liter- 
ature," in your issue for October 1, seems to me to take 
the critic's rather than the teacher's point of view. It 
would be desirable indeed to start the boys off with a 
course calculated to make them " realize that literature 
is a fine art " ; and then to jump them from these studies 
in " the near and the minute " to " the consideration of 
the large and the remote "; and finally to impress upon 
them the significance in literature of the individual and 
the universal mood. The spirit of Mr. Moore's sugges- 
tions is very fine. But it is an article of my teaching 
creed that the approach to literature is as personal a 
matter for each student in the clsss as it would be for 
the untaught man out in the world. You cannot foretell 
at what book or poem, or phrase even, a particular soul 
will kindle. My own experience leads me to conclude 
that most boys appreciate the big things in literature 
before they have eyes for matters of art and craft; so 
that I should place Mr. Moore's second course before his 
first, were I following his plan. But there undoubtedly 
are a minority of students who come at the craftsman- 
ship first ; for them the change would be unfortunate. 

The proper method, to my mind, is very simple, but 
few teachers follow it. I should put into the introduc- 
tory courses as many books of as many kinds as I could 
— reproducing in a highly selected way the varied pan- 
orama of the interests of life. I should try to indicate 
the peculiar point of view of each kind of book, as I 
came to it, — without passing judgment upon it, or set- 
ting it above or below another kind. If such a course 
presents sufficient variety, the student is likely to find 
what his own temper needs. From that moment I be- 
lieve he is " introduced " to literature; and any later 
critical information he acquires, no matter how helpful, 
is of secondary importance. 

The more the teacher is simply a lover of books, the 
greater will be his success. The love of books, like any 
other passion, has a kindling power; but critical schemes 
have none to speak of. Most of our teachers of liter- 
ture, in my opinion, are lovers of critical theories more 
or less unsound; too few of them are hearty lovers of 
the great books they pretend to " teach." If you are 
committed to a theory of the novel that can best be illus- 
trated by Henry James, you are not likely to lure your 
classes to a love of Fielding or Scott or Dickens. 

If my plan is even simpler on paper than Mr. Moore's, 
I am ready to admit that it is far more difficult of exe- 
cution. It demands of the ideal teacher imaginative 
sympathy with every student and every book; perhaps 
it demands of him also a poet's eloquence. But it is the 
right ideal for a teacher to fall short of, if one must fall 
short. John Erskine.

FROM LIT ERAR Y LONDON. 

(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
I never accppt very readily the charge of plagiar- 
ism that is frequently brought against authors. Such 
charges can be made very elaborately upon very 
slight data. To anyone familiar with the currents 
of literary life, it is quite apparent that the same idea 
may occur almost simultaneously to two or three 
people. This is most in evidence in the case of a 
short story, where an idea that might be thought 
absolutely original has inspired, almost at the same 
time, two people far apart. Not less remarkable 
are coincidences in the titles of books. Again and 
again we have seen two publishers announcing a 
book well-nigh identical in character, and sometimes 
even in name. The last case that has come before 
me was in the recent publication of a work entitled 
" Napoleon's Marshals." It was a well- written, 
carefully-compiled volume, — disfigured, as I think, 
by an anti-Napoleon bias, but packed with details 
concerning the eminent men who assisted Bonaparte 
in his great career. Yet there was at the same 
moment another book being written with equal care, 
which it was intended should bear the same name ; 
for it also was a story of the Marshals of the first 
Empire. This second writer has now had to look 
around for a new title, and is calling his book 
u Napoleon's Empire-Builders," which perhaps, after 
all, is just as good a title as that of the rival work ; 
but what a strange coincidence it is ! 

Equally regrettable are the many publishers' 
projects which are injured by this misfortune of co- 
incidence. I remember, on one occasion, Mr. David 
Nutt projected an edition of Howell's " Familiar 
Letters," under the editorship of Mr. Joseph Jacobs. 
There had not been an edition of this book for fifty 
years ; yet only a few weeks before Mr. Nutt's great 
undertaking was to appear, another publisher sent 
forth a much cheaper issue of it to the world. Mr. 
Nutt was persuaded at the time that someone had 
betrayed the secret of his projected book ; but I, 
who was behind the scenes, know that this was not 
the case. Such things are constantly happening. 
At this moment, for example, the Cambridge Uni- 
versity Press is publishing a complete edition of the 
plays of Beaumont and Fletcher in ten volumes, 
edited by Arnold Glover, and the firm of George 
Bell & Son is also issuing the same works in a splen- 
did library edition in twelve volumes, edited by Mr. 
A. H. Bullen. Both these sets of the plays must 
have been projected some years ago. and quite inde- 
pendently of each other. It is not likely, however, 
that there is room for both of them. The demand 
for the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher must be very 
limited, and it is deplorable that there should be 
rival editions, each in so attractive a form. 

Another case that occurs to me is that of the 
- Memoirs of the Comte de Grammont." Sir Walter 
Scott was responsible for an edition of this wonder- 
ful book, in 1811. It was issued again, in Bonn's 
Library, in 1846. In 1889 Mr. John Nimmo pro- 



duced the book much more handsomely. For nearly 
twenty years there was no further edition, but quite 
recently two separate firms published the memoirs 
again — in the same week ! 

Perhaps the very latest case of this kind is that 
of a young Scot who with great elaboration had pre- 
pared a book upon Margaret Gordon, Carlyle's first 
love. Before he had found a publisher, an American 
author came into the field with a similar book bear- 
ing precisely the same title ; and this book Mr. John 
Lane has just published in England. Many of us 
will find it hard to believe that Margaret Gordon 
was worth one volume, let alone two. The idea that 
she was the " Blumine " of " Sartor Resartus " has 
been quite exploded by Mr. Alexander Carlyle, who 
makes it clear that all the lovely episodes presented 
in reference to Blumine were based upon circum- 
stances connected with Jane Welsh, who became 
Carlyle's wife. In any case, the misfortune of the 
young Scottish author commands our sympathy. 

There has naturally been a considerable amount 
of interest excited as to what manuscripts Mr. Mere- 
dith left behind him, unpublished. When I paid 
my first visit to Mr. Meredith, twenty years ago, he 
showed me one such manuscript, entitled "The 
Journalist." Mr. Frederick Greenwood was, he told 
me, the hero of the book ; but Lord Morley of 
Blackburn (then Mr. John Morley) and Mr. Stead 
(who followed Mr. Morley in the editorship of the 
"Pall Mall Gazette") were both portrayed. A 
few months before his death, however, Mr. Meredith 
gathered two of his friends around him — one of 
them his doctor — and declared his intention of 
burning this unfinished manuscript, and sundry 
others that were at his hand ; and this was actually 
done. 

Happily, as I am bound to consider it, Mr. Mere- 
dith left one unfinished manuscript behind him ; it 
is entitled "Celt and Saxon," and it incorporates 
Mr. Meredith's strong feelings with regard to the 
peculiarities of the two races. He himself was 
proud of being a Celt. " I have not a single drop 
of English blood in my veins," he once said to me. 
There are other fragments of Mr. Meredith's 
unpublished writings that will be forthcoming in 
the new edition of his works in twenty-six volumes 
that has just been projected. This edition is to 
appear in England through the firm of Constable, 
in which firm Mr. Meredith's son, Mr. William 
Maxse Meredith, is a partner. Some of these frag- 
ments of Mr. Meredith's, in which I am greatly 
interested, are his " Translations from Homer : Ex- 
periments in English Hexameters," that well deserve 
printing. Meanwhile, the volume of Mr. Mere- 
dith's Letters, which is to be the sole authoritative 
contribution to his biography, will not be ready for 
publication for a year or more. Lord Morley of 
Blackburn, who will edit it, has already received a 
number of striking letters ; for Meredith was a very 
prince of letter-writers.

THE DIAL

Chesterton on Shaw, and Shaw 
on Chesterton.* 



It was surely an odd fancy that prompted Mr. 
Chesterton to write a book on his irrepressible 
contemporary, Mr. Shaw. Whatever its impel- 
ling motive, it is as entertaining as anything Mr. 
Chesterton's exuberant genius has yet produced. 
He writes with all his wonted sureness of himself 
and of his theme, — except that he does falter 
for a moment to acknowledge his inability to 
treat the music-loving part of Mr. Shaw's person- 
ality. "Upon this part of him I am a reverent 
agnostic," he declares ; " it is well to have some 
such dark continent in the character of a man 
of whom one writes. It preserves two very 
important things — modesty in the biographer 
and mystery in the biography." 

Doubtless Mr. Chesterton would be the last 
to deny that we see in every person or object 
only what we bring with us to see. Hence we 
have in his book quite as much a picture of 
Mr. Chesterton as a study of Mr. Shaw. The 
two-edged quality of criticism has never made a 
more striking or more amusing display of itself 
than in this analysis of the supposedly Shawish 
or Shavian or Shawensian characteristics. For 
instance, the following passage from an early 
page might just as easily have been written 
about the author as by him — with the simple 
change of a proper name. Indeed (with this 
change) Mr. Shaw himself might have written 
it of Mr. Chesterton. 

" But here comes the paradox of Shaw; the greatest 
of all paradoxes and the one of which he is unconscious. 
These one or two plain truths which quite stupid people 
learn at the beginning are exactly the one or two truths 
which Bernard Shaw may not learn even at the end. 
He is a daring pilgrim who has set out from the grave 
to find the cradle. He started from points of view which 
no one else was clever enough to discover, and he is at 
last discovering points of view which no one else was 
ever stupid enough to ignore. This absence of the red- 
hot truisms of boyhood ; this sense that he is not rooted 
in the ancient sagacities of infancy, has, I think, a great 
deal to do with his position. . . ." 

The last sentence, referring to certain matters 
of fact, must be abruptly broken off, else the 
transposed application would be incorrect. A 
little later occurs a passage illustrating the 
thorough good-will and jovial friendliness with 
which the writer has approached his self-imposed 
task. In reading it, Mr. Shaw's confirmed veg-

etarianism must be borne in mind, and also Mr. 
Chesterton's ample physical proportions. 

" I seem to remember that when he was lying sick 
and near to death at the end of his Saturday Review 
career he wrote a fine fantastic article, declaring that his 
hearse ought to be drawn by all the animals that he had 
not eaten. Whenever that evil day comes there will be 
no need to fall back on the ranks of the brute creation ; 
there will be no lack of men and women who owe him 
so much as to be glad to take the place of the animals; 
and the present writer for one will be glad to express his 
gratitude as an elephant." 

As to the plan and scope of the book, it begins 
with a characteristic assertion : " Most people 
either say that they agree with Bernard Shaw 
or that they do not understand him. I am the 
only person who understands him, and I do not 
agree with him." Then follow, after a short 
preface, chapters on Mr. Shaw as an Irishman, 
as a Puritan, and as a Progressive ; but the 
greater part of the book is devoted to " The 
Critic," " The Dramatist," and " The Philoso- 
pher." Hence it is, as was natural, more a study 
of the writer than of the man in his extra- 
literary capacity. The fact of his Irish birth 
and his protestantism is made to explain many 
of Mr. Shaw's peculiarities, and the argument 
is delightfully plausible — perhaps too plausible 
to be wholly convincing. In the chapter on Mr. 
Shaw as critic, attention is chiefly directed to his 
well-known anti-Shakespearianism, which again 
is traced to " the fact that he is a Puritan, while 
Shakespeare was spiritually a Catholic. The 
former is always screwing himself up to see 
truth ; the latter is often content that truth is 
there. The Puritan is only strong enough to 
stiffen ; the Catholic is strong enough to relax." 
The chapter entitled " The Dramatist " takes 
up the earlier of Mr. Shaw's plays, with appre- 
ciative and occasionally adverse comment, in 
which the playwright is here and there charged 
with not understanding human nature, and with 
certain other failings. Some of his offenses 
against refined dramatic art are also pointed out. 
But the reviewer's tone is in general cordial, and 
there is little of captious criticism. 

In his character of philospher, Mr. Shaw is 
thought by his critic to have inflicted three 
injuries on mankind and to have rendered two 
important services. " The primary respect in 
which Shaw has been a bad influence," we are 
asked to believe, " is that he has encouraged 
fastidiousness. He has made men dainty about 
their moral meals." And " the second of the 
two points on which I think Shaw has done 
definite harm is this : that he has (not always 
or even as a rule intentionally) increased that 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



281 



anarchy of thought which is always the destruc- 
tion of thought." This, coming from the pen 
that wrote it, almost moves to merriment ; and 
so perhaps may the third charge, that Mr. Shaw 
" has to a very slight extent, but still percep- 
tibly, encouraged a kind of charlatanism of 
utterance among those who possess his Irish 
impudence without his Irish virtue." The ser- 
vices rendered by this Irish philosopher are thus 
stated : 

" In the first place, and quite apart from all partic- 
ular theories, the world owes thanks to Bernard Shaw 
for having combined being intelligent with being intel- 
ligible. He has popularized philosophy, or rather he 
has repopularized it, for philosophy is always popular, 
except in peculiarly corrupt and oligarchic ages, like our 
own. . . . The second phase of the man's really fruitful 
efficacy is in a sense the converse of this. He has im- 
proved philosophic discussions by making them popular. 
But he has also improved popular amusements by 
making them more philosophic. And by more philo- 
sophic I do not mean duller, but funnier; that is, more 
varied." 

Three superstitions, we are told, are enter- 
tained by the public concerning Mr. Shaw, " first 
that he desires 'problem' plays, second that 
he is paradoxical, and third that in his dramas 
as elsewhere he is specially 'a Socialist.' " But 
all this is false, maintains Mr. Chesterton, even 
though he has shown that Mr. Shaw's plays turn, 
as a rule, on a " very plain pivot of ethical or 
philosophical conviction"; and although, as in 
the first passage quoted above, he refers to the 
man as an habitual utterer of paradoxes. But 
these and other details may be considered chiefly 
matters of opinion and point of view, and disa- 
greement with the writer need not lessen one's 
interest in his book. 

How far, after all, has the writer succeeded 
in presenting the real Mr. Shaw ? If he under- 
stands him as well as he claims to, the passive 
subject may conceivably feel highly indignant ; 
for who likes to think that any man can take 
his measure ? " The greater the truth, the 
greater the libel " is a true word. And even 
an obviously distorted representation is not 
pleasant to the victim. It is hard to laugh at 
a caricature of oneself. But, as we are happily 
in a position to know, the victim in this case 
has lost no whit of his good-nature, or of his 
resources of wit and satire. Almost simultan- 
eous with the appearance of Mr. Chesterton's 
book in this country there comes an extended 
review of it in the London " Nation," the writer 
being none other than Mr. Shaw himself, who 
thus discloses the interesting situation of a biog- 
rapher reviewed by the subject of his biography. 



The entertainment is indeed a rare one. Mr. 
Shaw begins by saying : 

" This book is what everybody expected it to be: the 
best work of literary art I have yet provoked. It is a 
fascinating portrait study; and I am proud to have been 
the painter's model. It is in the great tradition of liter- 
ary portraiture: it gives not only the figure, but the 
epoch. It makes the figure interesting and memorable 
by giving it the greatness and spaciousness of an epoch, 
and it makes it attractive by giving it the handsom- 
est and friendliest personal qualities of the painter 
himself." 

But, humorously laments the reviewer, not all 
readers will be able to see the many virtues 
ascribed to him. 

"He perceives that I am an angel; and he is quite 
right. But he will never convince those who cannot see 
my wings; and for them his portrait will never be a 
good likeness. Fortunately, lots of other people will 
take his word for it, and some will rub their eyes and 
look a little more carefully; so his book will be of signal 
service to me." 

All the same, the genial reviewer goes on to say, 
the book is in some respects quite misleading. 
Thereupon he proceeds to point out an obviously 
baseless criticism of a certain passage in " Major 
Barbara," and to convict the critic of making 
" a howling misquotation ' ' from the play. Then, 
taking up Mr. Chesterton's animadversions upon 
his abstinence from alcoholic beverages, the man 
of unspoiled relish for Adam's ale continues, in 
pleasantly sarcastic vein : 

" Teetotalism is, to Mr. Chesterton, a strange and 
unnatural asceticism forced on men by an inhuman per- 
version of religion. Beer-drinking is to him, when his 
imagination runs away with him on paper, nothing short 
of the communion. He sees in every public-house a 
temple of the true catholic faith . . . and he will see 
nothing but ' cold extravagance ' in my sure prevision of 
the strict regimen of Contrexeville water and saccharine 
in which his Bacchic priesthood will presently end." 

The article extends to some length, with much 
excellent fooling, and much that is a degree 
more serious than fooling, but none the less 
excellent. Mr. Chesterton is rather well char- 
acterized as, " at present, a man of vehement 
reactions ; and, like all reactionists, he usually 
empties the baby out with the bath." Finally, 
the suggestion is offered that a subscription 
be taken up for the purpose of sending Mr. 
Chesterton to Ireland for a two years' sojourn. 
There he will learn many things. 

" He will eat salmon and Irish stew and drink whisky 
prosaically, because he will hunger and thirst for food 
and drink, instead of drinking beer poetically because 
he thirsts for righteousness. And the facte will be 
firm under his feet, whilst the heavens are open over 
his head; and his soul will become a torment to him, 
like the soul of the Wandering Jew, until he has 
achieved his appointed work, which is not that of spec-

ulating as to what I am here for, but of discovering and 
doing what he himself is here for." 

It is a pity that Mr. Shaw's review could not 
be bound up with the book — that Chesterton 
on Shaw and Shaw on Chesterton could not go 
together to the reader, for his infinite delight 
and merriment. But the book as it stands is 
well worth while. p ERCY F Bicknell. 



The Foundations of Heredity.* 

While the scientific world was ringing with 
the first shock of controversy over the " Origin 
of Species," an obscure monk in an Austrian 
convent garden was patiently observing the laws 
of heredity as manifested in successive genera- 
tions of peas. It is striking evidence of the 
eternal value of exact experimentation that the 
work of Gregor Johann Mendel is to-day a living 
force in Biology perhaps only second to that of 
Charles Darwin. 

Mendel's communication on plant hybridiza- 
tion was made to the natural history society of 
Briinn in 1865, and for thirty-five years re- 
mained totally unnoticed. In 1900, de Vries, 
Correns, and Tschermak almost simultaneously 
called attention to the importance of his work ; 
and a new field of experimental study of her- 
edity came into being, with the name of Mendel- 
ism. Professor Bateson, of the University of 
Cambridge, became the most ardent exponent 
of the new principle in England, and when the 
statistical school of biologists made light of it 
he published in 1902 a book entitled " Mendel's 
Principles of Heredity: A Defence." The 
present work is not a new edition of the old one, 
but a substitute for it. In view of the progress 
of Mendelian experiments during the last five 
years, it is less a defence of a new study than an 
exposition of the results of a tried and fruitful 
one. 

The essential points in Mendel's observations 
were three in number. First, he found that 
many properties of his peas — tallness, for 
example — were inherited, as indivisible unit- 
characters. Each of the individual offspring 
of a cross was tall or short ; none half-way 
between. Second, one character might be dom- 
inant over the other, so that in a given plant it 
only would appear, while the latent or recessive 
character could be transmitted to a future genera-

Professor of Biology in the University of Cambridge. Cam- 
bridge : The University Press. (G. P. Putnam's Sons, New 
York.) 



tion. Third, and most important, he showed that 
in the formation of the germ-cells of a plant of 
mixed ancestry the opposite characters, dominant 
and recessive, separate ; so that each individual 
germ-cell has one, and one alone. For example, 
breeding a pure dwarf and a pure tall pea gives 
offspring all tall. Tallness is dominant. But 
the tall second generation contain the short ele- 
ment, as shown by further breeding. The third 
generation produced by self-fertilized seed of 
the second contains tall and short individuals in 
the proportion of three to one. The short ones, 
as shown by further breeding, have no tall ele- 
ment ; of the tall three-quarters, one quarter 
have only the tall element ; the other half are 
mixed, like their parents of the second genera- 
tion. The tall and short elements segregate so 
that each ovule or pollen grain has one alone ; 
and by " chance " recombination we get one- 
quarter pure tall, one-quarter pure dwarf, and 
one-half mixed, the latter appearing tall because 
that quality is dominant when both are present. 
Professor Bateson's book is the most complete 
and authoritative presentation of the studies 
which have been made of inheritance phenomena 
of this sort ; and such studies are numerous and 
striking. He discusses Mendelian inheritance 
of almost numberless characters, such as size, 
color, smoothness, habit, resistance to specific 
disease, form of flower and seed, presence of 
starch, in plants ; and color, hornlessness, char- 
acter of coat or feathers, and peculiarities like 
the waltzing habit in mice, among animals. 
Many of the cases are complicated by the 
presence of numerous inter-related variables. 
Twenty-one distinct forms may be produced by 
separations and recombinations of elements in 
the offspring of two types of primrose. Professor 
Bateson discusses all the most important of such 
cases in great detail, and with as much clearness 
as the abstruse nature of the subject-matter 
warrants. He includes practically all work up 
to 1908, and is fair and just in estimating the 
importance of various contributions within the 
field of Mendelism. The book includes three 
interesting portraits of Mendel, and handsome 
colored plates showing inheritance in sweet peas, 
primroses, fowls, mice, and moths. 

The principles of Mendel will undoubtedly find 
place in that firm foundation for the theory of 
heredity which will some day be constructed ; and 
his careful experimental method offers perhaps 
the surest instrument for its upbuilding. It is 
unfortunate, however, that Professor Bateson 
is. so occupied with the brilliant successes of 
Mendelian study that he can see no merit in 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



283 



work of any other kind. The asperity of old 
conflicts might well be softened by omitting 
references to " the so-called investigations of 
heredity " by Galton and Pearson and the Bio- 
metrical school, as work which u has resulted 
only in the concealment of that order which it 
was ostensibly undertaken to reveal," and the 
statement that " it will appear inexplicable that 
work so unsound in construction should have 
been respectfully received by the scientific 
world." Both the experimental and the statis- 
tical methods are required for the full elucidation 
of the truth. 

Professor Bateson has a wide and just vision 
of the importance of the subject of Heredity — 
or Genetics, as he prefers to call it. He says : 

" It may be anticipated that a general recognition of 
the chief results of Mendelian analysis will bring about 
a profound change in man's conception of his own nature 
and in his outlook on the world. Many have in all ages 
held the belief that our powers and characteristics are 
directly dependent on physical composition; but when 
it becomes known that the dependence is so close that 
the hereditary descent of certain attributes can be proved 
to follow definite predicable formulae, these ideas acquire 
a solidity they never possessed before, and it is likely 
that the science of sociology will pass into a new phase. 
... It is not in dispute that the appearance of a char- 
acteristic may be in part decided by environmental 
influences. Opportunity given may decide that a char- 
acter manifests itself which without opportunity must 
have lain dormant. The question of opportunity and 
of the degree to which the conditions of life are opera- 
tive in controlling or developing characters will some 
day demand attention, but in order to answer such ques- 
tions successfully it is the first necessity that a knowl- 
edge of the genetic behavior of the factors should be 
obtained. . . . The outcome of genetic research is to 
show that human society can, if it so please, control its 
composition more easily than was previously supposed 
possible. . . . The power is in their hands and they will 
use that power like any other with which science can 
endow them. The consequence of such action will be 
immediate and decisive. For this revolution we do well 
to prepare."

MISINTERPRETATION'S OF THE CARLYXES.* 

Mr. R. S. Craig, the author of a book which 
he curiously entitles " The Making of Carlyle," 
has become dominated by a theory, which is 
allowed some more or less full expression on 
almost every page, at least of the latter part of 
the work. That theory is that Jane Welsh was 
simply an ambitious but overrated and spiteful 
woman ; that she did not love Carlyle, but did 
love Edward Irving, and married Carlyle for 
ambition : that Froude is right in arguing that 

* The Making of Cablyle. By R. S. Craig. New 
York : John Lane Co. 



she forced Carlyle to marry her in consequence 
of Irving's telling Mrs. Montagu that Miss 
Welsh was in love with him ; that Carlyle's 
caustic manner of describing his contemporaries 
is largely due to the example of his wife, to 
whom, in writing his Reminiscences, he sought, 
as it were, to make reparation for his neglect. 
It is of course a great pity that Mr. Craig could 
not have deferred the publication of his volume 
till after the appearance of the recent "Love 
Letters of Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh,"* 
which would have given him ample evidence on 
some of these points. But it was not necessary 
to wait for the publication of these letters ; Mr. 
Craig has not, it seems to us, correctly inter- 
preted the mass of evidence made accessible in 
a trustworthy form in the four volumes of u New 
Letters and Memorials of Thomas and of Jane 
Welsh Carlyle," the Correspondence of Carlyle 
and Goethe edited by Professor Norton, and 
Mr. David Wilson's volume on Froude and 
Carlyle. For example, the introduction to the 
" New Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh 
Carlyle," as is well known, contains an admirable 
estimate of Mrs. Carlyle ; Sir James Crichton- 
Browne's view, there expressed,! has never been 
successfully controverted. Yet Mr. Craig vir- 
tually ignores this view ; he has nothing what- 
ever to say about Mrs. Carlyle's physical condi- 
tion, £ which is of importance even in the early 
period more especially treated in his book. Nor 
is his book wholly free from errors in detail. For 
example, he says that by June, 1821, Miss 
Welsh had conveyed to her mother the use of 
Craigenputtock for life (p. 168) ; whereas the 
letter enclosing this conveyance § is dated by 
the editor, Mr. Alexander Carlyle, evidently on 
good authority, 19 July, 1825. From Mr. 
Craig's reliance on Froude (pp. 373f.) it would 
seem that he has not even seen Mr. Alexander 
Carlyle's volumes ! His admiration for Froude 
is excessive, and is perhaps the cause of some of 
his own shortcomings. The only fault he lays at 
Froude 's door is an occasional misunderstanding 
of the evidence. Writing of the Carlyles' differ- 
ences, he says (p. 372) : 

" After Carlyle's death the world professed to dis- 
cover profound and persistent disagreement, and took 
Mrs. Carlyle's published letters as proof of her misery. 
But even Froude telling the truth and only the truth

And this after the careful labors of Professor 
Norton, Mr. Wilson, and others, have utterly- 
discredited Froude's work, both in general and 
in particular. The point would not be worth 
dwelling on were it not for the fact that occa- 
sionally a misguided admirer or defender of 
Froude* turns up and helps to prolong the life 
of his mythical story of the Carlyles. Even if 
there be a slight modicum of truth in his books, 
the sooner his grossly distorted and ignoble "his- 
tory " of Carlyle is consigned to oblivion, the 
sooner will it be possible for a fair-minded public 
to learn and rightly appreciate the real facts. 

And this is not, of course, to say that Froude, 
in the beginning at least, intentionally exagger- 
ated Carlyle's faults. The whole trouble arose 
from the fact that Carlyle's " heightened and 
telling " phraseology, the utterance of a strongly 
emotional nature, fell into the hands of one who 
flatly misunderstood it, and whose passionate 
fondness for the picturesque in biography dis- 
posed him to credit an utterly unfounded theory 
interpreting the strange phenomena of the Car- 
lyles' married life. And having adopted this 
theory he felt bound to defend it, thus more and 
more calumniating the object of his worship. 

Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle were far 
from angelic natures. They both possessed the 
fatal gift of sarcasm, and they doubtless did 
many persons injustice. The difference between 
them and others is that they dared to say openly 
and to write what many others dare only think 
or whisper. The consequences were disastrous, 
and they paid the penalty. But let it be re- 
membered that they were both trying to tell the 
truth (which is often painfully embarrassing) ; 
and that in many instances they probably suc- 
ceeded. Whatever else they may have been, 
they were not shams ; and they helped purge the 
air of some cant. 

To return, in closing, to Mr. Craig, it is pain- 
ful to speak of his work as we have done, and we 
regret the necessity of doing so. The book con- 
tains also minor faults which help to strengthen 
the unfortunate impression it produces. Its 
bulkiness is inexcusable ; it would have gained 
immensely if its five hundred pages had been 
compressed into half that number. Needless 
repetitions occur on every page. Froude, for 

♦For example, in The Nation, lxxxviii. 418. 



example, is called " eloquent " at least three 
times. Mrs. Carlyle's encomium of " Sartor 
Resartus " is printed at least as many times. 
Strange grammatical and rhetorical construc- 
tions abound ; for example, " Neither he nor 
Froude mention it " (p. 94) ; " He had never 
' assisted,' as a young minister or doctor has so 
frequently to do, placing themselves for the first 
time under tutelage " (p. 228) ; " inferior society 
than that" (p. 338); "his Welsh kindred" 
(p. 422); " the two conceived a mutual admira- 
tion for each other " (p. 439) ; " Carlyle found 
plenty friends " (p. 440) ; " Would Milton be 
likely to find any publisher in the whole range 
of London to take Paradise Lost off his hands, 
let alone give him <£10 for it? " (p. 446). French 
words are printed without accents, and the last 
syllable of Teufelsdroeckh always loses the e. 
The style at times is irritating ; there is a con- 
stant tendency to short jerky statements or ques- 
tions that might pass for epigrams ; for example, 
" Fame ? " (p. 433) . On page 59 we meet with 
Carlyle's refreshing etymology, Lord equals 
" Law- ward " ! The fact that Carlyle was 
originally responsible for this error does not 
excuse his biographer. 

The author has added another to the list of 
books in which Carlyle and his wife are misin- 
terpreted and misrepresented. The successful 
biographer of Carlyle is yet to appear. When 
he does arrive, he will prove to be a man who 
will be willing to give up a theory for the sake 
of the truth ; and he must have a keener insight 
than any of the " poor fools " — to borrow the 
Sage's own cheerful term — who have yet 
attempted this most difficult task.

The Case of IjOmbroso.* 



It is with hesitation that a reviewer calls at- 
tention to a volume which, considered logically or 
charitably, should receive the solace of neglect. 
Yet it is inevitable that the current interest in 
" spiritualistic " revelations will seize upon Pro- 
fessor Lombroso's work (now accessible in poor 
English) as an authoritative and conclusive 
pronouncement. Let it then be recorded that 
the volume bearing the alarming title, "After 
Death — What?" presents through three hun- 
dred and fifty pages an amazing exhibition of 
credulity, which it is difficult to reconcile with 
the author's unassailed reputation, and his

recognized contributions to complex aspects of 
modern science. 

Most of those of like reputation, who have 
yielded to the conclusion that the perplexing 
phenomena which they witnessed were not ex- 
plicable by the recognized laws of mind and 
matter, have yet expressed their conviction, at 
times regretfully, or it may be hesitantly, and 
commonly with a reserve that held aloof from 
extravagant explanation and uncritical credu- 
lity. The evidence has been endured, possibly, 
but hardly yet embraced. The Italian savant, 
however, having once admitted the possibility of 
phenomena that transcend ordinary experience, 
and having had recourse for his explanation to 
the intervention of departed spirits, feels no 
further limitations of logic or plausibility, and 
records with apparently equal acceptance the 
most variously assorted medley of miracles, 
albeit commonplace ones, and the crassest vio- 
lations of common law and common sense, that 
in our day and generation have been collected 
within a single volume under a reputable signa- 
ture. The reader, as he follows the narrative, 
must forcibly remind himself that he is exam- 
ining, not the wonder-book of a pre-scientific 
traveller with a generous appetite for good 
"copy," but the conclusions reached with all 
the show of experiment and apparatus of a 
twentieth century laboratory student. 

It is not the purpose of the present notice to 
summarize the extensive so-called evidence, but 
only to indicate the attitude toward it of Pro- 
fessor Lombroso. He informs the reader that 
by training and temperament he was strongly 
antagonistic to all this sort of occultism ; yet his 
conversion seems to have been easy, and to have 
been effected by an hysterical girl in whom he 
discovered the loss of vision, but who by com- 
pensation " saw with the same degree of acute- 
ness at the point of the nose and the left lobe 
of the ear," and in whom also " the sense of 
smell became transferred to the back of the 
foot." The same inventive subject predicted 
that on a certain day " she would be delirious, 
and then would have seven cataleptic fits that 
would be healed with gold," all of which, mar- 
vellous to relate, ensued as predicted. But the 
crowning instrument of his conversion was the 
Italian peasant medium, Eusapia Paladino, 
whose advent to our shores is now heralded. In 
the presence of this woman, physics, chemistry, 
and physiology retire abashed, while psychology 
is silenced in confusion. Chairs and tables and 
large pieces of furniture move about with motives 
of their own, but unmoved by human forces ; 



metronomes start themselves going, and all 
sorts of scientific apparatus is pressed into a 
travesty of service to prove that the medium is 
innocent of the phenomena that occur in her 
presence. None the less, the same Eusapia has 
at times indulged in freeing one of her hands to 
move objects or give raps ; in lifting the table 
with her knees ; and in slyly removing a hair 
from her head to fasten it to one of the instru- 
ments so as to influence its registration ; in 
gathering flowers before the sittings, which later 
were to appear miraculously " apported "; but 
all this without in the least disturbing the con- 
fidence of her observers in her genuine mani- 
festations. 

The difficulties of the situation must be evi- 
dent when Professor Lombroso apologetically 
records that " It is now certain that supernu- 
merary spectral limbs are superimposed on her 
true limbs, and act as their substitutes. These 
phantom doubles used to be often taken for 
her normal arms." The "spirit-forms" that 
appear in the presence of mediums are thus 
explained : 

" This fact proves that the body of spectral appear- 
ance is formed at the expense of the body of the psychic, 
and the matter is confirmed by the circumstance that 
in the first materializations of mediums many of the 
phantasms they evoke bear a certain resemblance to 
the face or the limbs of the mediums, or even to the 
whole of his or her person." 

Accordingly, when one of Lombroso 's col- 
leagues declines to accept a spirit-form as that 
of his mother, because of the conflict between 
what was presented and the actual truth, he is 
urged to bear in mind that spirits, unused to 
the vocal mechanism of the medium, must make 
mistakes, and that their behavior must be 
excused. 

" He lays stress also upon the fact that the phantasm 
had a fuller bust than his mother, not remembering 
that the phantasms assume the words, gestures, and 
body of the medium. This should also have explained 
for him the vulgar habit of playfully biting the beloved 
one, which is common to all the other phantasms evoked 
by Eusapia from whom they borrow it." 

Instances like the following are recorded as 
facts without trace of hesitation. 

" The child Yencker gave raps when two months old. 
. . . The nephew of Seymour wrote automatically when 
nine days old ; at the age of seven months he gave 
typtological communications." 

Once more, a medium in forming her spirit 
companion found that " she herself had lost her 
knees and feet. But if she touched the place 
where they normally should be, she felt pain. 
Hence an invisible part of them existed." The 
same thing happened to Eusapia, whose " con- 



286

[Oct. 16, 



trol " explained that he had removed her lower 
limbs to decrease her weight for the levitation. 
Now as to explanation, let this suffice : 

" There is also another singular attribute of mediums 
which we must admit in order to explain certain spirit- 
ualistic phenomena; namely, the fact that in the psy- 
chological atmosphere of the medium in a trance, and 
by the medium's own action, the conditions of matter 
are modified, just as if the space in which the phe- 
nomena takes place, belonged not to three but to four 
dimensions, in which (according to the theory of the 
mathematicians) the law of gravity and the law of the 
impenetrability of matter should suddenly fail, and the 
laws that rule time and space should suddenly cease, so 
that a body from a far-off point may all at once find 
itself near by, and you may find a bunch of freshest 
flowers in your coat-pocket, without their showing any 
trace of being spoiled." 

Similarly, as time is inverted, the medium reads 
the future as we should recall the past. Yet this 
power is curiously limited. 

" As respects the lottery, — something in which all 
the village population of the province of Naples are sin- 
ners, — she had no success whatever in premonitions, but 
in compensation possessed a singular telepathic power." 

Or consider this explanation of the passage of 
objects out of a closed room, which procedure 
naturally involves a transit through wood or 
glass or bricks. 

" Either it must pass through the panes of glass 
without coming apart or breaking up, — that is to say, 
its atoms must pass through the inter-atomic spaces of 
the panes; or else it must be decomposed into impon- 
derable material (an operation which we not happily 
call ' dematerialization') before passing the walls, and 
afterwards be recom posed; or else, in order to appear 
and disappear without passing through the wails at all, 
it would be necessary for it to pass into the fourth 
dimension of space, and then, returning, emerge from 
that again." 

Surely, in this strain there is no need to con- 
sider anything as more remarkable or less worthy 
of credence than anything else, and the testimony 
of apparatus and the records of photographs 
become a mere travesty of a scientific procedure. 
If this is the type of popular scientific presenta- 
tion that is to shape opinion, the task to be faced 
by those with real concern for the hygiene of 
popular logic seems stupendous. Where, indeed, 
are we to find the sturdiness of view and criti- 
cal conservatism that form the safeguard of 
modern thinking ? One can only pause dumb- 
founded, and ask, " After Lombroso — What? " 

And yet the reflection remains that it is no 
longer exceptional for the man of scientific train- 
ing to use the logic of his own specialty with 
moderate success, and yet reserve a corner of 
his intellectual domain free from the invasions 
of logic and open to the satisfaction of a dra- 
matic instinct or temperamental longing. It 



is none the less natural to assume that the per- 
sonal factor in the exercise of the two pursuits 
is not wholly different. Of this there are occa- 
sional corroborations in the tendency to yield 
to alluring theories, and accordingly to abandon 
that sane perspective of importance which more 
than anything else forms the heart of the scien- 
tific temper. In this aspect, the psychology of 
reputable believers in disreputable tales becomes 
yet more interesting than the psychology of 
the tales themselves ; and such is the case of 
Lombroso. Joseph Jastrow. 



The Doves Press Shakespeare.* 



It was inevitable, probably, that in his work 
at the Doves Press, Mr. Cobden-Sanderson 
would sooner or later get around to Shake- 
speare. In his five- volume edition of the Bible, 
brought to completion nearly five years ago, he 
gave a monumental setting to the first of all 
books ; and now a volume devoted to " Hamlet " 
marks the beginning of a similar service for 
the writings which, in the estimate of English- 
speaking peoples at least, rank second in the 
peerage of literature. It must not be under- 
stood, however, that we are ultimately to have a 
complete Shakespeare in this form ; Mr. Cobden- 
Sanderson is not a young man, and conditions 
of work at the Doves Press preclude hasty pro- 
duction. The present plan contemplates a selec- 
tion of some dozen plays only, to be approached 
by stages. The first stage embraces the four 
supreme tragedies — " Hamlet," " Lear," 
" Othello," and " Macbeth." The publication 
of these will occupy at least two years ; at the 
end of that time another stage will be under- 
taken, — or it may be decided to stop with the 
Tragedies above mentioned. 

The plan of presentment involves something 
more than a mere reprint of Shakespeare in 
beautiful dress, in the modern accepted form of 
the text. Believing that a capacity for appre- 
ciating literature in the form in which it was 
originally given to the world is worth cultivating, 
Mr. Cobden-Sanderson has gone back for his 
text to the original editions, following almost 
literally the old spelling and punctuation, and 
avoiding the division into acts and scenes intro- 
duced into later editions. Thus, the present 
" Hamlet " reproduces the second quarto im- 
printed at London in 1604, with such portions

Denmark. By William Shakespeare. Limited edition.

of the first folio of 1623 as are not contained 
in the quarto. Such a presentment would, of 
course, be " cauiary to the generall " (as this 
text has it) ; but to those for whom the present 
edition is intended, there cannot but be a 
decided charm in reading " Hamlet " as it was 
actually written, with all the atmosphere of the 
original printing successfully preserved. 

Those familar with the Doves Press books 
know that they do not depend at all for their 
distinction, as the volumes printed by William 
Morris did in large degree, upon elaborate orna- 
mentation. A " flourished " initial at the be- 
ginning is the only note of decoration in this 
edition of " Hamlet." The charm of the book 
is wholly inherent in the type and its arrange- 
ment, in the presswork and the paper. Except 
for two or three fantastic characters, such as 
the freakish interrogation point, the type is both 
beautiful and legible ; the presswork is doubt- 
less as near perfection as may be attained ; and 
the paper could scarcely be bettered for the 
purpose. 

There is, however, a feature of the typography, 
the type arrangement, which, although some may 
think it trivial and others justifiable, seems to 
us so serious, and to involve so fundamental a 
misconception of the laws of typographic art, 
that we cannot pass it without protest. We 
refer to the " spacing " of the letter-press of the 
book. Now as the printing art is at present 
known and practised among men, the only way 
in which the group of letters composing a single 
word may be presented to the eye as a distinct 
unit — as a word-form — is by leaving a blank 
(technically, a " space '*) between the word and 
its neighbors. The space being indispensable, 
the only question is simply how much space. 
In his essay on " The Book Beautiful," Mr. 
Cobden-Sanderson has laid down the precept 
that " the whole duty of Typography is to com- 
municate to the imagination, without loss by the 
way, the thought or image intended to be con- 
veyed by the writer," a dictum which, in another 
form, has the authority of Herbert Spencer. 
Now we maintain that there must be distinct and 
decided loss of the author's thought or image 
when the space between words in a printed page 
is so slight that the reader is continually puzzled 
and retarded in his reading. The puzzlement 
may be unconscious or subconscious ; the loss is 
nevertheless actual. Through long usage the eye 
has become accustomed to a certain minimum 
space between words ; an arbitrary reduction of 
this space to a half or a third the customary 
amount results in visual distress of no slight 



degree. We are familiar enough with the theory 
underlying this microscopic separation of words. 
It is held that the conventional spacing of type 
results in a printed page made ragged and 
unsightly by irregular spots of white over its 
whole extent, — sometimes, as in the poorer sort 
of machine composition, where over-spacing is 
the rule, the effect is that of jagged perpendic- 
ular rows of words rather than of ordered hori- 
zontal lines. To avoid these blemishes, and to 
produce a page of even harmonious tone and 
color, very thin spacing is held to be essential. 
If a printed page were meant to be merely dec- 
orative, there would be something in this con- 
tention ; but the primary purpose of a book is 
to be read, and no principle is sound aesthetically 
which seriously interferes with this essential 
function. 

We have dealt rather more fully with this 
point than might perhaps seem warranted. But 
the defect is to us an important one, and it 
happens also to be a defect not confined to Mr. 
Cobden-Sanderson's work. It is found in even 
more marked degree in the volumes produced 
by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press ; it 
is prominent in the work of two of our most 
artistic printers, Mr. Bruce Rogers and Mr. 
Updike. Whatever may be the abstract reasons 
in its defence, we believe few readers will dis- 
agree with us that its practical application, in 
books intended to be read, results in confusion 
and irritation. A happy medium, in this as in 
so many things, is the goal to seek. 

In general effect, this latest volume from 
the Doves Press amply fulfils Mr. Cobden- 
Sanderson's well-expressed ideal of workman- 
ship, — it is indeed a thing of " order touched 
with delight." To the student of Shakespeare 
who is also a lover of beautiful bookmaMng, its 
appeal will be irresistible. That we may finally 
have the whole of Shakespeare in this form, is 
a consummation devoutly to be wished.

288 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Mr. Clifton Johnson's book, " The Picturesque 
Hudson " (Macmillan). Much as Mr. Johnson has 
that is interesting about the great river that, histori- 
cally at least, holds first place in American art and 
letters, it seems to us that he has done little to 
present what he calls its chief quality. Of course 
people's ideas of the picturesque will differ : it is not 
remarkable that Mr. Johnson's should be different 
from that of Thomas Cole, but it is at least worth 
noting. Mr. Johnson is a skilful observer and 
writer ; his book has much that is good in its history, 
gossip, description, as well as in its pictures. But 
it shows that if he is right, there has passed away a 
glory from the Hudson. We do not mean that Mr. 
Johnson chooses unpicturesque subjects ; it is proper 
for a true idea of the Hudson, that we should have 
the locks at Troy, the wharves at Albany, the 
Poughkeepsie bridge, the battery at New York. Nor 
need such scenes be unpicturesque ; the picture of 
the Haverstraw Brickyards is one of the best in the 
book. We mean that he does not give any pictur- 
esque character to those places that we should nat- 
urally think of as picturesque, and which some 
people can still find as romantically beautiful as they 
were to the Hudson River School — such places as 
Anthony's Nose, the Northern Gateway of the 
Highlands, the Tappan See, the Palisades. Of 
these more purely landscape scenes in the book, the 
only one we really admire is the view near Fishkill. 
Here Mr. Johnson has been singularly happy in 
composition and execution. But in the main his 
Hudson is sadly uninteresting : if it could have 
offered no more, it would never have inspired Irving 
and Morris and Willis. Yet in reality the Hudson 
preserves its ancient charm: from Sunnyside and 
Undercliff and Idlewild it is still as lovely as ever. 
And though one miss the affectionate romanticism 
that gave the river a wonderful glory in the older 
days, yet still one may find a pictorial quality and 
a literary charm, unless one be ultra-modern and 
realistic. But one would hardly suspect it from Mr. 
Johnson's testimony. 

The deeper " The Human Way " (Harper), by 

meanings Mrs. Louise Collier Willcox, is a col- 

oflife - lection of essays written with, at 

times, an almost startling insight into the deeper 
meanings of life. Toward the end of the book occurs 
this definition, perhaps a new one, of genius : " In- 
deed, what we call genius, as distinguished from 
talent, or learning, or accomplishment, is really a 
power of strong appeal to the great masses of man- 
kind which grows out of profound self-knowledge." 
Something of this profound self-knowledge that 
amounts to genius Mrs. Willcox's chapters certainly 
reveal. She demonstrates most convincingly the 
oneness of human experience and shows that a rich 
individual life is impossible apart from a rich col- 
lective existence. Something of the bracing influ- 
ence of that pragmatism or personal idealism that 
is now in the air is felt in her stimulating pages, as 



when she asserts : "So it comes to seem but the 
short-sightedness of youth that wailed over limited 
scope for effort or an uncongenial atmosphere ; for 
whatever atmosphere we desire and think about, we 
make ; and whatever ideal we hold, we create ; and 
only those who dream fitfully fail to make their 
dreams come true. To come slowly to this realiza- 
tion is to accept no outlook as final." In the essay 
on " The Service of Books," from which the fore- 
going is taken, there are many other good things ; 
but there is also a rather harsh and summary treat- 
ment of Tennyson against which protest rises. After 
observing, with a degree of truth, that " it is a truism 
that he who writes for his own generation renounces 
the next," the author continues : " Tennyson spoke 
to the thought of his own day and then fell back." 
But it was long years before his contemporaries 
would listen to him, and it is not hard to find lines 
and even whole poems of his that will not soon be 
suffered to die. Mrs. Willcox's style appeals to the 
well-read : she is steeped in Shakespeare and betrays 
her fondness for Browning, Swinburne, and Mere- 
dith ; and the body of her thought is not inferior to 
its garb. 

Now that people can read for them- 
maslue tmaS selves, they rather prefer to read 

their poetry at home. In Shake- 
speare's day, thousands heard poetry on a stage who 
heard it nowhere else. Nowadays millions have 
poetry in books who never dream of it on the stage. 
Yet the drama remains a delightful poetic means, and 
in spite of theatrical critics who condemn "the closest 
drama" there are still written plays that the poet 
never thought of having produced. Whether such 
be the case with Mr. Louis J. Block's " The World's 
Triumph " (Lippincott) we will not make sure. 
There are those who believe that anything will do 
on the stage if there are people who want to act it 
and others who want to see it. " Faust," " Manfred," 
u Peer Gynt," are examples. We judge, however, 
that Mr. Block prefers the dramatic form because 
it enables him to present imaginatively some of his 
hopes and thoughts on life and the present world. 
So at least we read his play. Science, the Church, 
the People, even the State, are at a standstill. The 
loosing of the world-riddle comes from the simplicity 
of devoted faith. We believe that in his Epilogue 
Mr. Block has rightly criticized himself : he has 
woven us a strange and wondrous mystery in an age 
that loves the clear and simple. This imaginative 
and melodious presentation, this pageant of ideal 
and poetic figures, seems to belong to an earlier age 
than ours. The work is, indeed, more a Christmas 
masque than a modern play, and must be read 
largely in the spirit of the past. In the confusion 
and turmoil of low ambitions and big attempts, the 
poet offers us a dream of faith. It would be aside 
from a true appreciation to offer definite dramatic 
criticism, and we prefer merely to recommend the 
play to readers who will take it for what it is, who

will read and find in poetic form food for thought 
and perhaps for the solution of difficulty. If one 
think there is no unanswerable argument, one may 
at least gain insights worthy of trust. 

A series of essays illustrating social 
Geo^ianel-a. England in the eighteenth century, 

by Mr. John Fyvie, is issued in a 
volume entitled "Wits, Beaux, and Beauties of the 
Georgian Era" (John Lane Co.). These essays, eight 
in number, take the form of biographical sketches 
with the emphasis placed on the social aspects of 
life. Some of these were well worth writing : the 
introductory essay on Samuel Foote, the " English 
Aristophanes," is particularly interesting not only as 
a vigorous defence of the actor-dramatist, but also 
for the light that it sheds on the world that Foote 
satirized on the London stage. The author supports 
his conclusions by quoting liberally from Foote's 
plays. Valuable, too, is the account of the Duchess 
of Queensberry's eccentricities, though mainly for the 
glimpses that it affords us of Gay and Swift. There 
seems, however, to be little reason for giving pro- 
longed attention to the careers of^such persons as the 
Duchess of Kingston and the Countess of Suffolk, 
whose titles to fame rest on their moral delin- 
quencies only. Mr. Fyvie's work contains little that 
is new or original ; it serves rather to emphasize 
opinions commonly held by giving concrete illus- 
trations. In his selection of instances the author is 
usually discreet ; and no attempt is made to enlist 
our sympathies for unworthy subjects. His work is 
throughout a very readable one ; the English is 
delightful, though at times somewhat informal ; but 
stately periods would scarcely seem in place in a 
discussion of the jokes of George Selwyn and the 
broad humor of the " clerical wit," the Rev. John 
Warner, D.D. 

A manual for In his little treatise on " Writing the 
writers of the Short Story " (Hinds, Noble & 
short story. Eldredge), the author, Mr. Esenwein, 

has approached the short story as an historian, as a 
maker of text-books, and as a literary adviser. It 
is always difficult to ride three horses at once, and 
in this instance they are not all guided with equal 
felicity. To be candid, the introductory chapters 
which discuss the rise of the short story are too 
brief, too general, and too cut up by quotations from 
various authorities, to be useful. It would be well 
to know more about the history of the short story 
than may be learned from these pages, if one wished 
to profess a knowledge of the subject. Again, the 
later chapters, which are more thorough, more 
authoritative, and always interesting, are split up 
into a multitude of sections and sub-divisions, filled 
with quotations from earlier criticisms, and sown 
with illustrations until it is doubtful whether an 
immature student of the elements of short-story 
writing could emerge with a clear idea of the whole 
matter. As history, and as an elementary text-book, 
Mr. Esenwein's book is not wholly satisfactory. But 
as a handbook and manual for literary aspirants who 



are trying to write salable stories, as a reference- 
book for college students who show more ability in 
narrative than the usual course in rhetoric requires, 
this work deserves a hearty recommendation. It is 
full of interesting criticisms, valuable comments, and 
stimulating suggestions. If the teacher of narrative 
cannot use it with his elementary courses, he can 
assuredly poach upon it for material to make these 
classes more effective. And the writer who is try- 
ing to compose not a theme but a short story will 
find that the editor of " Lippincott's Magazine " has 
made good use of the practical experience of his 
editorship. 

Vernon Lee's A boU g h ° f the Duddin g W t™^ OT 
latest book bay laurel, fastened to the dash- 

of essays. board of a street-car in Rome by a 

poor road-mender who had a love of the beautiful, 
furnished Miss Violet Paget ("Vernon Lee") with 
a name for her latest book, " Laurus Nobilis " (John 
Lane Co.), which pleads in eloquent strain the cause 
of beauty. Three significant coincidences, early 
pointed out, indicate the line of argument followed 
by the author. These coincidences are : " that 
between development of the aesthetic faculties and 
the development of the altruistic instincts ; that 
between development of a sense of aesthetic harmony 
and a sense of the higher harmonies of universal life ; 
and, before everything else, the coincidence between 
the preference for aesthetic pleasures and the nobler 
growth of the individual." Miss Paget heartily 
believes in the " vital connection between beauty and 
every other noble object of our living," and she 
emphasizes the difference between the low, passive, 
or sensual pleasures, and the higher beneficent and 
active delights of the soul. The highest aesthetic 
satisfactions are dissociated with ownership and self- 
indulgence ; they are attainable to the reverent and 
the pure-minded ; but, by one of the ironies of what 
is commonly called civilization, are beyond the reach 
of the toiling money-getter. Walter Pater's influ- 
ence is felt throughout the book, both in unconscious 
imitation of his parenthetic style and in occasional 
quotation or allusion. Ruskin also has left his stamp 
on the writer's mind. In spite of the much fine 
writing in the book, one feels the earnest sincerity 
of it all. A casual reference to a bank-holiday 
journey in a third-class compartment, with a goat 
and numerous other fellow-passengers, lends weight 
to the writer's advocacy of the simple life and the 
inexpensive pleasures. The book is one to read 
slowly and take to heart. 

Professor William Edward Simonds 
of Knox College has followed up his 
text-book on English literature with 
a similar "Student's History of American Litera- 
ture" (Houghton), although the historical setting 
has been less dwelt upon in the later work because 
of its assumed familiarity to the student. From the 
earliest colonial attempts at literature down to the 
very latest noteworthy novel, the author has traced 
with care and judgment the outlines of our literary

history. Chronological tables, suggested readings, 
and portraits and other illustrations, together with 
a twenty-five-page index, combine to make this one 
of the best student's handbooks we have in its field. 
Without searching for errors amid so much evident 
accuracy, one may note the occurrence of Mr. 
Thompson Seton's name under its older and now 
discarded form of Seton-Thompson ; and also the 
inclusion of Mr. Owen Wister and Mrs. Edith 
Wharton among "the New York group " of present- 
day novelists. Philadelphians and Bostonians will 
frown at this. The author's preface does well to 
urge the cultivation of "the library habit" on the 
student's part ; and it also contains a glowing word 
of promise for the future of our literature. Else- 
where, too, the writer betrays an infectious fondness 
for the treasures amid which he is working. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. George P. Upton's "The Standard Concert 
Repertory," published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., 
is a companion to the author's " Standard Operas " and 
" Standard Concert Guide." It provides brief descrip- 
tions of the overtures, suites, symphonic poems, etc., 
heard in modern concerts, and is a thoroughly judicious 
and trustworthy guide for the layman who loves music. 
About fourscore composers are represented, many by a 
considerable number of examples. There are also some 
fifty portraits, in groups of three to the page. 

" The Master Painters of Britain " is the title of the 
new special number of "The International Studio" 
(John Lane Co.). It aims, through a series of beautiful 
full-page reproductions of great paintings, with brief 
comment, descriptive, critical, and biographical, to fur- 
nish a complete survey of British painting from 
Hogarth's time to the present. The editor is Mr. 
Gleeson White, formerly editor of "The Studio." 
Besides a page of comment on each picture, he has 
written Introductions to the four chronological periods 
into which, by style and tendency, the pictures are 
grouped, and has compiled, for an appendix, brief biog- 
raphical notes of the artists represented. One can hardly 
imagine a more attractive and at the same time profitable 
way of studying British art in informal, amateur fashion 
than by the perusal of this beautiful picture book. 
The reproductions, nearly 200 in number, are well 
chosen and of excellent quality. 

About a year ago, Professor Calvin Thomas published 
the first part of " An Anthology of German Literature," 
giving selections (in modernized form) down to the 
close of the mediaeval period. A second section has now 
been compiled, extending from Luther down to the 
classical age of Goethe and Schiller. These great poets 
are indeed represented, but not typically, the intention 
of the work being to serve as an introduction to the 
study of the great period which began with them. There 
are seventy-eight numbers in the entire anthology, 
equally divided between the two sections, each number 
being a book, an author, or a literary group. The 
editor's modernized versions are confined to the first 
section; the examples given in the second are literally 
reproduced. The general principle of the selection is " to 
give a good deal of the best rather than a little of every- 
thing." Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish the work. 



Notes. 



" The White Stone," in a translation made by the 
capable hands of Mr. Charles E. Roche, is the latest 
volume to be published in the new edition of the writ- 
ings of M. Anatole France in English. It bears the 
imprint of Mr. John Lane. 

From the Torch Press, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, we have a 
booklet containing " Wise Sayings and Favorite Passsages 
from the Works of Henry Fielding." It includes, besides 
extracts from the novels, the " Essay on Conversation," 
and has been compiled by Mr. Charles W. Bingham. 

The " Free Press Anthology," compiled by Mr. 
Theodore Schroeder, and published by the Free Speech 
League, New York, is a medley of extracts ranging from 
Milton's " Areopagitica " and Mill on " Liberty " to 
modern apologists for the frank discussion of matters of 
sex and the open preaching of anarchism. 

A new edition of " The Golden Treasury," published 
by the Macmillan Co., includes both series of the 
famous anthology in a single volume. It is the best 
selection of lyrics that we have, despite the fact that the 
editor's judgment did not in the second series display 
the unerring quality that was exemplified in the first. 

"A Dictionary of Quotations from English and 
American Poets," revised and enlarged by Miss Anna 
L. Ward, is published by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell 
& Co. in their thin-paper series of poets. Other volumes 
of this series are a Wordsworth with Lord Morley's 
introductory essay, and a Lowell (the early poems now 
out of copyright) edited by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole. 

A " Source History of the United States," prepared 
by Professors Howard Walter Caldwell and Clark 
Edmund Persiuger, is announced by Messrs. Ainsworth 
& Co. The plan of the book is to present a fairly 
consecutive and connected history of the evolution of 
the American nation and people, the emphasis being 
placed throughout upon political and social ideas and 
ideals. 

The " Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society " for 
its thirtieth session are published by Messrs. Williams 
& Norgate. There are seven papers and two symposia, 
besides the customary official matter. Among the 
contributors are Messrs. F. C. S. Schiller, Bernard 
Bosanquet, J. H. Muirhead, and G. F. Stout. Discus- 
sions of such subjects as Bergson and Pluralism show 
that the Society is nothing if not up to date. 

" The Stage History of Shakespeare's King Richard 
the Third," by Miss Alice I. Perry Wood, is a recent 
publication of the Columbia University Press. Perhaps 
no other of the plays has had such varied fortunes as 
this, or has suffered under such an indignity as was laid 
upon it by Colley Cibber. The chapter on the fortunes 
of tragedy in America, at the hands of Kean, Forrest, 
Booth, Irving, and Mansfield, is of peculiar interest. 

Attractive little bibliographies of Oliver Wendell 
Holmes and Samuel Johnson, based on material in the 
Brooklyn Public Library, are issued by that institution, 
in uniform shape with its former centennial biblio- 
graphies. The lists cover fourteen and sixteen duo- 
decimo pages respectively, and contain all that even a 
specialist has much need to concern himself with. In 
the Johnson list the critical eye notes a misspelling of 
Lichfield (with a superfluous t) on page nine. 

Thirteen new volumes of " Crowell's Shorter French 
Texts " have just been issned. They include three 
plays of Moliere (" L'Avare," " Le Bourgeois Gentil-

hoinme," " Le Medecin Malgre" Lui "), all edited by 
M. Marc Ceppi; six volumes of stories and sketches by 
Dumas, Erckmann-Chatrian, About, Moreau, and Mine. 
de Bawr; a " Choix de Poe"sies Faciles," edited by Mr. 
W. M. Daniels; an abridgment of " L'Avocat Patelin "; 
a selection of "Poemes X apoleoniens " ; and a "Choix 
de Contes Populaires de la Haute-Bretagne." 

The Macmillan Co. publish a volume of " Readings 
in American Government and Politics," by Professor 
Charles A. Beard, — a source-book to accompany the 
author's text upon this subject, now in course of prepa- 
ration. The selections are 237 in number, grouped in 
32 chapters, from " Colonial Origins of American In- 
stitutions " down to recent " Social and Economic Leg- 
islation." The book affords a very valuable adjunct to 
the work of instruction in American history and politi- 
cal science. 

A new volume has just been published by the Messrs. 
Scribner in the series of " Original Narratives of Early 
American History." It has for its contents "Narra- 
tives of New Netherland " from 1609 to 1664, and is 
edited by Professor J. Franklin Jameson. The Hudson 
narratives of van Meteres and Robert Juet lead off in 
the list of contents, which ends with Stuyvesant's report 
of the surrender of the province to the English. There 
are an even score of documents altogether, most of them 
translated from the Dutch. 

An article on " The Religion of a Sensible American," 
by President David Starr Jordan, is now published as 
a booklet, with additions, by the American Unitarian 
Association. It originally appeared in the " Hibbert 
Journal." In it the author has " set forth the religious 
belief and work of a friend, no longer living; one who 
could stand without question as a sensible man, and one 
whose thought and life were typical of the best which 
we may call American." He is not named in the text, 
but the book is dedicated to the memory of the bite 
Wilbur Wilson Thoburn, of Stanford University. 

Welcome to English readers is a translation of M. 
Bede's "Rembrandt und seine Zeitgenossen." It is 
called " Great Masters of Dutch and Flemish Painting " 
(Scribner), and the vivacity and picturesqueness of the 
original has been well preserved by the translator, 
Margaret L. Clark. Rembrandt is of course the prin- 
cipal figure; nowhere else will one find his life and 
work more sympathetically described. But Frans Hals, 
Rubens, and Van Dyck, the Dutch masters of the genre 
picture, of landscape and of still-life, each has separate 
and dignified treatment. The illustrations, forty in 
number, have been well chosen, but are less clearly 
reproduced than they should be. 

The " Bulletin of the Library Association of Port- 
bind," which appears monthly (excepting July and 
August), calls attention to some of the good books of 
all time, and also to some of the good books of the 
present time as represented by the library's latest 
accessions. Another designation of this library is the 
" Free Public Library of Multonomah County," which 
makes it evident that Portland in Oregon, and not 
Portland in Maine, is the city rejoicing in the possession 
of so intelligently active an institution. The September 
number of the Bulletin opens with a short list of the 
best essayists, each title followed by a quoted criticism. 
In this and the other departments of the little paper 
economy of space and printer's ink is carried so far as 
to give, with a few exceptions, only the last names of 
authors, as " Smith. Jewellery. 1908." The printed list 
of branches and deposit stations is unexpectedly long.

The American Newspaper 



By JAMES EDWARD ROGERS 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been 
made. The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion being treated as one of 
concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of getting 
acquaintance with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book discusses in succession the following topics: The 
Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper; The City and the Newspaper; The Nature of the American Newspaper; The Influ- 
ence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00. postpaid tl.10. 

English PoemS : The Elizabethan Age and the Puritan Period By WALTER C. BRONSOX 

So favorable has been the reception accorded " The Nineteenth Century " and " The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century " 
that the present volume needs little introduction. It follows the same general plan as its predecessors, with the added advantage 
of an especially fascinating field — the most spontaneous and exuberant period of English poetry. The notes contain elucidations 
of difficult passages and illuminating commentary — the index and bibliography are unusually elaborate and detailed. 550 pages. 
12mo. cloth ; library edition, net $1.50, postpaid $1.66 ; school edition, net $1.00. postpaid $1.15. 



The Psychology of Prayer 



By ANNA LOUISE STRONG 

A systematic investigation from the point of view of modern psychology of the mental processes involved in prayer. Prayer 

is described as the result of the " conflict between different selves." This conflict in turn is eliminated by the prayer process. 

Numerous examples from actual observation of children add vividness to the work, which has a deep philosophic interest and 

throws light on present-day religious problems. 125 pages, 12mo, cloth; net 75 cents, postpaid 83 cents. 

The Sunday Kindergarten : Game, Gift, and Story By carrie s. ferris 

This book is intended not only for trained kindergartners who may be induced to take up Sunday-school work, but also for 
the many teachers of little children who have no knowledge of kindergarten methods, but who can follow carefully arranged lessons 
with intelligence. Every lesson has its story, its games, and its appropriate table-work, all centering around a religious theme; a 
theme that is comprehensible to the child, and that sets his mind in tune for harmonious and helpful life with his playfellows and 
those who makeup his social environment. The equipment for this course is of three kinds: U) The Teacher's Manual, which 
should be in the hands of the chief teacher, the assistants, and the musician ; 1 2 > The permanent material, which can be used from 
year to year without renewal ; < 3 1 The temporary material, which must be renewed each year. Teacher's manual, net $1.25, post- 
paid $1.40 ; permanent equipment for each pupil, net $1.00. postage extra ; temporary material for each pupil, net 35 cts., postage extra.

The greatest work of a great English novelist. 

" Mrs. Dudeney's books have all shown remark- 
able strength, literary feeling and capacity in the 
depiction of character. But in this book she 
springs lightly, on tiptoe, with winged step." — New 
York Times. 

" Mrs. Humphry Ward at her best does not sur- 
pass this."— The Book News Monthly. 

"It is masterly," says the Outlook, "a really 
profound study of motive and character. Like ' Tess 
of the D'TJrbervilles,' it deals boldly with the prob- 
lems of passion, and may offend in this way, but. 
like that book also, it is essentially dramatic, a 
searching exposition of human nature under the 
stress of conflicting emotions."

CHARLES DICKENS AND HIS FRIENDS 

By W. TEIGNMOUTH SHORE. Profusely illustrated. Cloth, $1.75 net. 

Mr. Teignmouth Shore takes us at once into the very midst of Charles Dickens's large and dis- 
tinguished circle of friends. The personality of the great novelist — strong, original, and fascinating — 
attracted the interest of all the famous people of the literary, artistic, and dramatic world of his day. 
Many of them were among his most intimate companions, and Mr. Shore's pages reveal to us the 
impression which Dickens's personality made upon his contemporaries. The opinions of these cultured 
men and women throw invaluable light upon lesser known traits of the novelist's disposition. 

The book will be read by all those who, knowing and loving Dickens the novelist, are eager to 
know more of Dickens the man. Interesting stories about "Boz " are to be found on nearly every 
page, and there is scarcely a name famous in the Victorian era which we do not find associated here 
with that of Charles Dickens. 

Some of the illustrations which add so much to the pleasure of the reader have never before been 
reproduced. The work in every way is a notable addition to Dickensiana. 

ADVENTURES IN LONDON 

By JAMES DOUGLAS. With photogravure frontispiece. Cloth, $1.75 net. 
The Athenseum says : " He gaily hits off a crowd of people who probably resemble Joey Bagstock 
in not overdoing the exercise of thought, but he notes also the serious side of London — the squalor 
and misery and horror of it, and the eternal ironies of town and country which entertained the plump 
little Satirist of Augustan Rome. The title of * Adventures ' is fully justified, for our author seems 
to be one of those happy persons to whom things happen — a Stevenson by disposition and good luck." 

EVERY-DAY JAPAN 

WRITTEN AFTER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS' RESIDENCE AND WORK IN THE COUNTRY 
By ARTHUR LLOYD, M.A. With an introduction by Count Tadasu Hayashi, late Japanese Min- 
ister for Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for Japan in London. 
With eight colored plates and ninety-six reproductions from photographs. Cloth, $4.00 net. 

LONDON TOWN, PAST AND PRESENT 

By W. W. HUTCHINGS. Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of reproductions from old prints, 
drawings and photographs. Cloth, quarto, two volumes, $6.00 net. 

Unique, comprehensive, and incomparable in value. It limits itself to no one period of time or 
to no one part of the Capital, and discusses no abstruse or antiquarian questions. It recounts in 
vivid language all the important events from Roman times to the present day. 

Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer, in a clever and suggestive chapter, essays to lift a corner of the veil 
behind which is hidden the future of London and presents some ingenious speculations on that theme . 

THE WORLD'S GREAT PICTURES 

In one volume, quarto, superbly illustrated, cloth, $3.50 net. 
" The World's Great Pictures " contains upward of four hundred and twenty examples of the 
world's great masterpieces, photographed from the actual pictures, many of which are beautifully 
printed in colors by modern processes, with a faithfulness in tone and coloring to the originals that 
gives them a distinctive charm. The text deals biographically with the artists and descriptively 
with their work, traces the progress of the art of painting from the Thirteenth and Fourteenth cen- 
turies, and does not omit to tell the reader when important copies of the pictures exist and where 
they are to be seen. Fine art paper has been used both for the plates and the descriptive text. In 
short, every resource of the photographer's and printer's arts has been drawn upon to attain the 
highest standard of artistic excellence in every detail.

RETROSPECTIONS OF AN ACTIVE LIFE 



By JOHN BIGELOW 



It is generally conceded that this 
great work is " the book of the year." 
It covers the period of the author's life 
from 1817 to 1867, and it d als with 
happenings and persons of the greatest 
importance. The author was born in 
New York State in 1817, and to the 
present day has engaged himself in 
patriotic interests of the first rank. 
As editor, author, and publisher of the 
New York Evening Post, as Consul and 
Minister to France, he has rendered 
services of the highest value to the 
Republic. Besides, he has enjoyed the 
privilege of friendship with most of the 
prominent personages of the past half 




century in England and France, as well 
as in his own country. The wealth of 
anecdote and correspondence which the 
volumes contain gives the work a wide 
range of personal interest. The book 
will bring new light to bear on vexed 
questions of history, and it can be safely 
said no future history of the period 
covered can be written without a con- 
siderable dependence on its authority. 

The work has been set up, printed, 
and bound by the DeYinne Press.

NEWLY PUBLISHED BOOKS 

THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER By james edward rooers 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been 
made. The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion being treated as one of 
concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of 
getting acquainted with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book discusses in succession the following topics: 
The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper: The City and the Newspaper; The Nature of the American Newspaper; The 
Influence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid 11.10. 

SOURCE BOOK FOR SOCIAL ORIGINS : Ethnological Materials, Psychological Standpoint, Classified 
and Annotated Bibliographies for the Interpretation of Savage Society By william i. thomas 

The papers forming the body of the book are by such eminent modern anthropologists as Boas, Tyler, Westermarck, Spencer 
and Gillen, Hadden, and Rivers. The author has an introductory chapter on the standpoint from which the materials are to be 
viewed, and critical comments are appended to each part. There are seven parts: (1) External Environment (Anthropogeography 
and Primitive Economics) ; (2) Primitive Mind and Education ; (3) Early Marriage ; (4) Invention and Technology ; (5) Art, Orna- 
ment, and Decoration ; (6) Magic, Religion, Ritual, and Ceremonial ; (7 ) Social Organization, Morality, and the State. The extended

THE ARMENIAN AWAKENING By leon arpee 

This book will be found singularly interesting and appropriate in the light of the occurrences of the past few years. Begin- 
ning with the " Dark Ages " of Armenian history, the author traces the religious attitude and the struggles of this people from 
the time of the introduction of Christianity. It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are familiar with the Armenian 
struggle for religious freedom, that political forces have been a strong factor in the persecution to which this people has been 
periodically subjected. All the sidelights which the condition of European politics could throw on the situation have been employed 
by the author, and his sympathetic treatment leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the various motives for the frequent 
outbreaks against the Armenians which have aroused the Christian world. 240 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.25, postpaid $1.36. 

THE CAMERALISTS: The Pioneers of German Social Polity By albion w. small 

To readers of English only, cameralism is virtually a lost chapter in the history of the social sciences. Although everything 
now belonging to German polity has a part of its heredity in that type of social theory, not every reputable student of the social 
sciences in America could correctly define the term, and few could name more than one or two writers to whom it is properly applied. 
In this volume there is given to readers of English the first reliable and detailed account of the cameralistic school.

STUDIES IN GALILEE By ernest w. qurney masterman 

Besides the Memoir of the Survey under the Palestine Exploration Fund, and the relevant chapters in works dealing with 
the whole country, several learned monographs have been written in English and German upon the geography, the history, the 
archaeology, and the present dialect of Galilee. Among these Dr. Masterman 's book will take a place of its own It furnishes fresh 
and notable contributions to our knowledge of so famous a region. It is richly stored with facts ; it is lucidly written ; and cannot 
fail to prove alike valuable to the expert and interesting to the ordinary reader. Dr. Masterman has labored for sixteen or 
seventeen years in the East. His numerous papers in journals devoted to the history or the geography of the Holy Land prove his 
acquaintance with the literature, ancient and modern, and have been largely used by experts. Very few know the recent history 
of the land or the life of the people as well as he. The book is profusely illustrated. 170 pages, 8vo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid $1.12,

A SELECTION OF A FEW NOTEWORTHY BOOKS FROM THE AUTUMN LIST OF 

DODD, MEAD & COMPANY 




DIAMONDS CUT PASTE 

By Agnes and Egerton Castle, authors of "THE BATH 
COMEDY," "THE SECRET ORCHARD," etc. Illus- 

trated. 12mo, cloth $1.50 

One of the daintiest, cleverest comedies in the shape of 
a novel that it is often one's good fortune to read. Sir 
Reginald Esdale returns from India, after several years' 
absence from his family, with a splendid record behind him, 
a distinguished career ahead of him, and a mild and senti- 
mental attachment to a pretty and clinging widow. The 
attachment is mild, but Sir Reginald is peculiar, and the 
widow is very clinging ; so that to achieve a disentanglement 
requires the most exceptional tact, knowledge of human 
nature, gentleness, and audacity. All these qualities are 
combined in Sir Reginald's wife. And " Diamonds Cut 
Paste " is a story of a most original, audacious, and clever 
intrigue, told with vivacity, and a deliciously light touch 
that will make this novel one of the gems of the season. 


WHERE SNOW IS SOVEREIGN 

A Romance of the Glaciers. By Rudolph Sthatz. Trans- 
lated from the German by Mary J. Safford. With 12 

A woman, young and beautiful, who by wealth and posi- 
tion has been guarded from every breath of danger, and freed 
from the slightest cares and responsibilities, goes on a climb- 
ing trip into the High Alps. There, in the desolate world of 
rocks, snow, and ice, for the first time she sees life bared of 
the artificialties and pettinesses of society. And there, while 
face to face with grim realities — hunger, cold, danger — she 
meets a man who is absolutely unlike the men about town 
whom she has known, a man who is rugged, stern, and 
strong, with a primitive, virile strength. She loves him, and 
he loves her, in a wonderfully big way ; and they live, they 
drink great draughts of tingling, red-blooded life. 

No description can do justice to the word-painting in 
this book.

INTIMATE RECOLLECTIONS 
OF JOSEPH JEFFERSON 

By Eugenie Paul Jefferson. Profusely illustrated, many 
of the pictures being from photographs taken by Joseph 

Jefferson. 8vo, cloth net, $3.50 

The universal admiration and love which Joseph Jeffer- 
son's life inspired has roused a widespread desire, expressed 
in various ways, to get closer to the real man, to know more 
of him and of the secret with which he swayed a nation. 
The present volume is an intimate and charming account of 
Joseph Jefferson's personal side and his home life, written 
by his daughter-in-law. It tells much that no one outside 
the family circle could tell ; it mentions many things that 
Mr. Jefferson, from feelings of delicacy, or modesty, could 
hardly have mentioned in his autobiography. 




The early Dutch merchants and patroons lived in much 
greater comfort and even elegance than any one nowadays 
but antiquarians suppose. Their dress, manners, customs, 
furniture, cooking utensils, etc., have passed away, yet there 
are numbers of people who would be glad to learn about 
such things, provided the information could be secured in 
convenient and entertaining form. For such readers Miss 
Singleton's book will be of great interest and value. 




THE PALADIN 

By Horace Ajwesley Vachell, author of " BROTHERS," 

"THE HILL," etc. 12mo, cloth $1.50 

A strange love affair between a girl of unusual charm 
and a man who means well, but is not of the usual mettle of 
heroes. They are engaged when her father, suddenly im- 
poverished and dishonored, ends his life. Thereafter, through 
the vicissitudes which fall to the lot of a young woman of 
refinement, compelled to make her own way in life, he is true 
to her, but is unable to bring their love affair to a happy 
termination. The plot is original, the interest sustained, 
and the denouement unexpected. "The Paladin" is an 
excellent example of Mr. Vachell 's work : graceful, pleasing, 
interesting, and will add new friends to his large circle of 
readers. 




THE CITY OF BEAUTIFUL 

NONSENSE 

By E. Temple Thurston, author of "THE APPLE OF 
EDEN," " MLRAGE," etc. 12mo. cloth .... $1.50 
" The City of Beautiful Nonsense " is in a lighter vein 
than has been characteristic of Mr. Thurston. It is a charm- 
ing love story, wholly idyllic. 

"As pretty and as fairy-like as a dew-besprinkled cob- 
web in the morning sun. And at the same time he makes it 
seem real and as true to all the best and the finest in human 
nature as, for instance, a Balzac novel is true to the worst, 
the vulgarest, and the most bestial. . . . If you like leisurely 
reading that twists around through all sorts of unexpected 
bypaths and indulges in all manner of little quips and quaint 
turns, and throws little pellets of philosophy at you when 
you least expect them, and makes cynical observations with 
an endearing smile and humorous ones with a serious face. 
But the people who demand a thrill on every page should be 
warned to pass by on the other side and buy some other 
book." — ifitw York Times. 




TREMENDOUS TRIFLES 

By Gilbert K. Chesterton, author of "Heretics," "Varied 

Types," "Charles Dickens." etc net, $1.20 

Mr. Chesterton is unquestionably one of the most bril- 
liant essayists of the day. He is start lingly original, for his 
ideas are always in opposition to those commonly held ; but 
no matter how unheard of and startling his hypotheses, he 
can back them up with subtle arguments, flashes of humor, 
and sheer cleverness until the reader is wholly fascinated. 




INTRODUCTIONS TO 
NOTABLE POEMS 

By Hamilton Wright Mabie, author of "MY STUDY 
FIRE." "THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT," "POEMS 
EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW," etc. Handsomely 
printed and bound with thirteen portraits of the poets. 

Nothing that Mr. Mabie has done has been received 
with more widespread and hearty approval than his work 
of introducing or reintroducing to a vast number of Amer- 
ican readers, classics of the English tongue. The classics 
exist ; and we all know about them, or possess a hazy ac- 
quaintance with them, but it is necessary for some apostle 
of culture like Mr. Mabie to stimulate our interest in them 
by graceful introductions and wisely chosen selections, in 
order that we turn our attention from magazines and news- 
papers to the wonderful literature which is the heritage of 
all who speak the English tongue. 




A GUIDE TO MODERN OPERA 

By Esther Singleton, author of " A Guide to the Opera," 
etc. Illustrated with portraits of famous operatic stars.' 

Miss Singleton's " A Guide to the Opera " has enjoyed a 
deserved success for a long time. It represents thoughtful 
and painstaking work, and it gives the reader a more care- 
ful and complete account of tbe history of each opera, the 
story and the music, than any popular book published. In 
writing a new volume. Miss Singleton has followed the same 
careful and comprehensive plan in describing the newest 
operas. As a result this book contains more information 
about the text and the music of such operas as " Salome," 
" Thais," " Pelleas et Melisande," etc., than any guide book 
to the opera published.

NOW FOR THE SOUTH POLE 

Lieutenant Shackleton's own narrative 

The Heart Si. Antarctic 

A Complete Record of His Antarctic 
Voyage of 1907-1909 

Nothing could be more timely than the publica- 
tion of this wonderful work by a real discoverer 
whose achievements have placed him on a plane 
with such explorers as Peary and Cook. Although 
his goal lay in the opposite direction, and his 
path led into a much less explored section, he 
succeeded in locating the South Magnetic Pole 
and came almost within sight of the South Pole. 

This will be the first exhaustive work on a sub- 
iect that is creating a veritable sensation in all 
parts of the civilized world at the present time. 
It is not merely made up of newspaper articles 
and fragmentary sketches, but is Lieutenant 
Shackleton's own account of a wonderfully suc- 
cessful expedition, carefully planned. Outside of 
the important scientific facts and discoveries re- 
vealed in the book, it is full of exciting adven- 
ture, and will undoubtedly be recognized as the 
greatest work of exploration of the year.

THE BIG NOVEL OF 1909 

Robert Hichens' Greatest Novel 

Bella Donna 

This noted author 
has returned to the 
region of his great- 
est triumph, Africa, 
and set his scenes 
in that wonderful 
country. "Bella 
Donna" is infinitely 
more human than 
" The Garden of 
Allah," and the 
Egyptian setting is 
one peculiarly suit- 
ed to Mr. Hichens' 
extraordinary tal- 
ent. The new story 
opens in London, but quickly changes to the Nile 
and the Egyptian pyramids, temples, and desert, 
where the reader is immediately enchanted by the 
mystical charm of that alluring atmosphere. 

It is a powerful drama — a contest between ma- 
terialism and idealism, between a man who loves 
the soul and a woman who adores the body.

BIG GAME HUNTING 

Hunting in British East 
Africa 

By PERCY C. MADEIRA 

The author has just completed this record of a 
highly successful hunt through the wilds of Africa. 
For years Mr. Madeira has been known as a 
hunter of big American game, and now his ex- 
ceptional success with rifle and camera in the 
African veldt and jungle has resulted in this fine 
book, which covers a great variety of interest and 
adventure, and shows what perils big game sports- 
men have to go through. He has only recently 
returned to the United States with an unusually 
fine collection of trophies, after having hunted 
over much the same ground Mr. Roosevelt is 
now covering. 

The illustrations, reproductions of photographs 
from the author's own camera, are truly remark- 
able. These include pictures of big game, and 
small as well, interesting camp scenes, and 
glimpses of hunts. It is without doubt the most 
comprehensive and up-to-date sporting book ol 
the year.

With plates in color and decorative designs by Edmund

Quarto, Cloth. Net §5.00. Special limited edition, with special 

proof prints, bound in vellum. Net S20.00 

Edmund Dulac has already been acclaimed as a genius of the first rank. 
As a colorist he is probably unrivalled, and his wealth of imagination and 
poetical feeling is expressed " with exquisite decorative effect." Mr. Dulac 
could not have found a better subject for his art than in the verse of the 
astronomer- poet of Persia. The spirit of the East is in his pictures, and the 
spirit of enchantment as well. They are full of mystery and of the richest 
Oriental color, and their general effect is weird and exquisite and won- 
derful. It is safe to say that Edmund Dulac proves himself the ideal inter- 
preter of " Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam."

By Mrs. WILFRID WARD 

Author of "One Poor Scruple," etc. $1.35 net. 

A fascinating story of London life marked by pictures 
of the great world, a presentation at court, and all the

The Wiving of Lance Cleaverage 

By ALICE MacGOWAN 

Author of "Judith of the Cumberlands" etc. With 6 Illustrations in Color by Robert Edwards. $1.35 net. 

It is an interesting company that is brought together in this book — notably the proud high-spirited 
mountain beauty who is the heroine, and the bold and fiery young hero who will surely stand high in the 
good graces of readers of the tale — a company of distinct types drawn with a graphic and spirited hand, 
a company moved by strong passions — love, and hate too, green jealousy and black revenge. 



The Socialist 

By GUY THORNE 

Author of " When It Was Bark," etc. $1.35 net. 

"A story that leads one on by its boldness, its vigor, 
its interesting realism of both ducal splendor and evil 
squalor, and by the individual interests it attaches to 
social phases and problems. The Socialist contains 
plenty of dramatic description and intensely studied 
character to remind one of When It Was Bark." — The 
Bundee Advertiser.

of Louis XIV. was known par excellence in France and

SOME MEDDLESOME LEGISLATION. 



That public education is the function of the 
State rather than of the municipality, is a prin- 
ciple that we have always maintained. The 
State is bound to see to it that throughout its 
area the means of education are provided upon 
as ample a scale as the general prosperity of the 
commonwealth makes advisable. The parsimony 
of the particular locality must not be permitted 
to keep its schools below the generally accepted 
standard, and the locality which would find it a 
real hardship to provide the needed support is 
entitled to assistance at the expense of more 
favored communities. On the other hand, the 
essentials being secured by law, the business of 
administration is distinctly a local affair, and it 
is in the last degree unwise for the State to 
prescribe matters of detail, or to interfere in 
questions that call for expert educational know- 
ledge. The average legislature is about as well 
fitted to handle such delicate questions as it 
would be to regulate the circulation of books 
by public libraries or the scientific management 
of hospitals. 

If we try to imagine the law of the State 
declaring that no library shall pay more than a 
dollar a volume for any of its books, or that the 
patients in every hospital shall be given fixed 
doses of certain specified drugs once a week, we 
shall have an exact parallel to the sort of educa- 
tional legislation which is imposed with blithe 
and self-satisfied ignorance upon the hapless 
schools of many a town and city throughout this 
country. Through the efforts of well-meaning 
people, whose judgment is as faulty as their 
intentions are good, a considerable number of 
our states have long been burdened with laws 
imposing upon their schools a cast-iron require- 
ment concerning the teaching of physiology with 
reference to the use of alcohol and tobacco. The 
mischievous ingenuity of these laws is almost 
beyond belief. They demand that certain dog- 
mas be enforced upon children with the most 
damnable iteration year after year, — dogmas 
that even a child's experience knows to be 
unsound ; and they make it almost impossible 
for text-books of physiology written in scientific 
language to be used in public schools. Men of 
science are practically unanimous in condemning 



320 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



these requirements, but the fanatics and doc- 
trinaires have their way with the legislatures, 
and the voice of reason avails for nothing. Thus 
science is discredited, the canker of insincerity 
affects the teacher's work, and reasonable 
admonition against the evils of intemperance 
misses its opportunity altogether. 

The Illinois legislature at its last session 
distinguished itself by imposing two singularly 
foolish laws upon the public schools of the State. 
One of these laws fixes a maximum price for 
every text-book used in the elementary schools ; 
that is, it forbids the authorization of any text- 
book that the publishers do not offer to supply 
at or below the price thus specified. The other 
law imposes upon all the teachers in the State 
the obligation to devote a certain amount of 
time each week to the inculcation of ideas con- 
cerning the humane treatment of the lower 
animals. 

Considering now the first of these amazing 
prescriptions, it is to be noted that the prices 
fixed are far below those at which the best books 
are obtainable. There is no reason to believe 
that the best books will be offered at the spe- 
cified prices, for the simple reason that compe- 
tition has already forced their prices to about 
as low a level as possible. Despite the " book 
trust " bogey that obsesses many minds, com- 
petition among school-book publishers has al- 
ready made unreasonable prices a practical 
impossibility, and the margin of practicable 
reduction is a narrow one in most cases. The 
only possible effect of the law must then be to 
force the substitution of distinctly inferior books 
for many of those hitherto in use. Now to save 
the child a few cents in the price of one of his 
school books is as good an example of a penny- 
wise and pound-foolish policy as could well be 
imagined. It runs counter to the elementary 
truism that a text-book is a tool, an instrument 
of precision, and that it has to be employed in 
one of the most delicate of the arts. A teacher 
who does not have the use of the best book 
available is like a railway engineer furnished 
with a cheap watch, a meteorological expert 
with a cheap barometer, or a violinist with a 
cheap fiddle. In these cases, the use of the 
inferior implement would be universally recog- 
nized as an inconceivable folly ; but in the case 
of the teacher, there seems to exist in many 
minds a notion that the implements he uses do 
not greatly matter. The making of text-books 
is now comparable in refinement, in the nice 
fitting of means to ends, with the making of 



microscopes and chronometers, and the best of 
them would be cheap at almost any price. The 
injury done to education by debarring the best 
books from use is immeasurably greater than 
the benefit derived from the trifling economy 
that is thus effected. 

Our second law, the one that makes humane 
instruction compulsory in all the Illinois schools, 
is a legislative "freak" which it is difficult to 
discuss seriously. All competent moralists are 
agreed that the one way not to be employed in 
developing the ethical instincts is the way of 
direct precept at stated periods. Yet in the 
present instance one particular sort of moral 
training is singled out, and is to be forced down 
the throats of all the young people at school in 
weekly doses of half-hour size (although daily 
six-minute doses are considerately permitted as 
an alternative), and this process is to be contin- 
ued ad nauseam from the kindergarten to the 
college. A plan better calculated to dull the 
moral consciousness and make the sympathies 
callous could hardly have been devised, and in 
the very name of the humanity which the mis- 
guided sponsors of this law seek to foster we 
enter our protest against it. Moreover, not 
content with securing its primary aim of uni- 
versal instruction in this subject, the law makes 
the drastic requirement that the instruction 
shall be given by every teacher in every school 
supported by public taxation in the State, 
enforcing the requirement by the penalty of a 
heavy fine for non-compliance. This means 
that a weekly half-hour shall be devoted to the 
work in every elementary school, every high 
and normal school, and even (for the law makes 
no allowances) in the State University. It also 
makes teachers of all sorts, special teachers in 
all the higher schools, teachers of singing and 
drawing and chemistry and gymnastics and 
geometry, amenable to the law and the penalty 
provided. Such a law, however unwise, is at 
least workable in an elementary school, where 
every teacher instructs the same group of chil- 
dren in a variety of subjects ; but in its appli- 
cation to one of the higher schools it spells 
nothing less than chaos. Its absurdity is so 
manifest that we cannot believe that it will long 
remain unrepealed, or at the very least unmodi- 
fied in its terms. It is, in its existing form, a 
singularly vicious example of the sort of legis- 
lative tinkering with education that works mis- 
chief wherever it is attempted. And the worst 
of it is that it tends to bring into discredit one 
of the noblest objects of ethical endeavor.

SPELLING RE FORM IN EXTREMIS. 

" It is not good to exult over the slain," says 
Homer. Spelling reform is moribund, and it would 
be unseemly to mock at its death-rattles. President 
Roosevelt's order has been rescinded. The people 
refuse to take the subject seriously, being little in- 
clined, in Arnold's phrase, to wander forty years in 
the wilderness in order that posterity may enter a 
very problematic orthographical Canaan. A few 
radical journals try to put the new program thru; 
the majority are recalcitrant. The great publishers 
will have nothing to do with it. The scholars who 
are alleged to be sound in the faith show themselves 
extremely lukewarm in the testimony of works. 
The consensus of literary and academic opinion is 
hostile. Spelling reform is dead, and in his lately- 
published volume, "English Spelling and Spelling 
Reform," Professor Lounsbury writes its epicedium 
in the guise of an argument. 

More in anger than in sorrow, we note with 
amusement. He has been devoting his Carnegie 
leisures to the maintenance against all comers of 
two theses. The first is, that in matters of diction 
and idiom, whatever is is right, or at any rate 
" equally as good " if *• predicated " upon prevailing 
usage. What the people say " goes," and is not 
to be " cut out " at the dictation of " highbrows." 
Why eschew short cuts ? " Female college " is con- 
venient, and " simplified spelling board " is pregnant 
with suggestiveness. The second thesis, and the one 
with which we are here concerned, is that in the 
matter of spelling whatever is is wrong. Conscious 
of public approval, he writes on the first topic with 
his customary good-humor. But the stubbornness 
of a wicked and perverse generation in rejecting 
his epanorthographical gospel induces in him a 
Jeremianic mood, the conflict of which with his 
native geniality of temperament provokes a smile. 
He is hurt by the " intemperate invective " of his 
opponents. But he will not retort in kind. The hard- 
est thing that he can find it in his heart to say of them 
is that they do not belong to the " higher class of 
minds, who have been gained over"; that although 
theirs is a " mild form of imbecility " their " procliv- 
ities are violently asinine"; that being "ill-informed," 
" semi-educated," or " educated ignoramuses," they 
are also '■ ignoramuses, not to say idiots "; that they 
manifest a " continuous incapacity " to apprehend 
reason ; that they dwell in an " atmosphere of serene 
ignorance," and the " extent of their linguistic igno- 
rance and the depth of their orthographic depravity" 
cannot be fathomed ; that they should confine their 
" displays of vast and varied stores of misinforma- 
tion " and their " pitiful exhibitions of ignorance " 
to the circle of "friends ignorant enough to sym- 
pathize with them "; that " the annals of fatuity will 
be searched in vain for utterances more fatuous " 
than theirs, and that their " innate incapability of 
comprehension and the orthographic iniquity in 
which they are steeped " abandon them to M dismal 



and unreal hallucinations " and u ghastly specters 
of an argument," and account for the "utter shal- 
lowness " of their reasoning and the " utter hol- 
lowness " of their objections. We are glad that 
Professor Lounsbury holds himself in check, and 
treats our " gabble " with a "singular lenience which 
it does not deserve." 

Herbert Spencer thought that all criticism of his 
particular version of evolution betrayed the intel- 
lectual limitations of the old ladies of his boarding 
house, whose conversation embittered his morning 
coffee. Similarly, everyone who hesitates to hustle 
the evolution of orthography along the lines pre- 
dicted and prescribed by a self-constituted board, 
perhaps too much " simplified " to see all aspects of 
so many-sided a question, is assimilated in Professor 
Lounsbury's jaundiced vision to the Englishman 
whose honor is rooted in a U, to the fine old crusted 
Tories who denounce in the " Times " the encroach- 
ments of American spelling, or the naive if not 
apocryphal gentlemen who declare that the spelling 
of Shakespeare is good enough for them. 

His publishers proclaim and his methods show 
that he is appealing to a popular jury. He could 
not complain, then, if the opposing advocate availed 
himself to the utmost of the natural human distaste 
for violent interference with existing associations 
which he so bitterly deplores as the main obstacle 
to the triumph of the righteous cause. Such an 
employment of ridicule as the test of (pragmatic) 
truth would be quite as fair as his own appeal to 
popular sentiment in favor of everything which 
labels itself " progress " or " science," quite as fair 
as his representation that the issue is sharply joined 
between sound linguistics and sentimental literary 
sciolism, quite as loyal, to animadvert on a typical 
detail, as his implication (p. 63) that Matthew 
Arnold did not know the Greek derivation of 
" diocese." 

Professor Lounsbury should learn from his Mill 
that an argument is not met at all until met in its 
strongest statement ; and from his Burke that in 
large and complicated social questions the conserva- 
tive instinct, which he denounces as prejudice, is an 
indispensable brake on the workings of another 
instinct which impatient doctrinaires dignify by the 
name of "progress" or "evolution," and which, if 
not so checked, would conduct mankind to most 
preposterous conclusions. Viewed in this light, con- 
servative feeling may deserve respect even in those 
who cannot support it by presentable arguments. 
No philosophical conservative can be quite sure in 
far-reaching issues that his resistance to question- 
begging " progress " is absolutely wise. His general 
conservatism, like the radicalism of his opponents, 
is a great parti pris. But in a generation that is 
intoxicated with the idea of change, and habitually 
confounds unconscious with consciously engineered 
and exploited evolution, an intelligent man may 
well feel that the conservative literary instinct in so 
large a matter as language puts the burden of proof

shibboleths, and no strong feeling for or against 
spelling one or two, or a dozen or two, words in 
this way or that. But I have a strong dislike of 
systematizing interference with language, and a 
strong distrust of all personally conducted evolutions 
or revolutions. And my feeling is not lessened by 
the historical example to which Professor Louns- 
hury innocently appeals. He cites the French 
Revolution to illustrate the thoroughgoing logical 
consistency in reform of the French mind in con- 
trast to the Englishman's besotted acquiescence in 
anomaly. The pertinency of this illustration is not 
apparent to me unless I am to think the French 
way in that instance the better. I do not. 

There is little space to scrutinize Professor Louns- 
bury's facts, logic, and linguistic principles in detail. 
His argument constantly faces two ways. The value 
of the proposed reform is magnified on the tacit 
assumption that it is to be thoroughgoing and con- 
sistent. Objections of large scope are minimized or 
made to appear pettifogging cavils by the admission 
that consistent spelling by the sound is beyond our 
reach, and the inference that it is petty prejudice to 
resist the rectification of a few anomalies. It does 
not require an expert dialectician to perceive that 
this reasoning is reversible. If the changes are to 
be considerable, the broad objections, sound or 
unsound, recover their prima facie claim to a 
respectful hearing. If they are to be slight, why all 
this agitation ? The divergence from English usage, 
for example, already regrettable, will become a grave 
matter if carried much farther. No tinkering with 
present conventions can be tolerated that is not 
acceptable to all English-speaking peoples. Again, 
the argument that the usefulness of existing printed 
books will be impaired can be made to look foolish 
only by insisting that reform will not proceed fast 
or far. Professor Lounsbury assures us that it will 
not. We believe him — and for cause ; the ignora- 
muses whom he denounces have seen to that. But 
how far and how fast would the " horses of Euthy- 
phron " have carried us if we had given them their 
heads ? 

Professor Lounsbury dwells so invidiously on the 
ignorance of his opponents that we are justified in 
replying that the kind of expert knowledge on which 
he chiefly insists is neither a very high order of 
scholarship nor, what is more to the point, so rele- 
vant to the question in hand as he supposes. By 
linguistic scholarship he seems to understand ac- 
quaintance with the history of English lexicography 
and the past variations of English spelling. We 
like quite as well for the present purpose Pater's 
definition, which is in effect that scholarship consists 
in the habitual and summary recognition of the pre- 
ferences of the language to which we are born. The 
fact that English orthography has fluctuated wildly 
may be a sufficient answer to controversialists who 
attribute a superstitious sanctity to our present spell- 
ing. It is not necessarily an argument in favor of 



altering the established and standardized usage of 
to-day. Nor is a note-book erudition in respect to 
these past irrationalities an essential prerequisite for 
a wise judgment as to the desirability of upsetting 
the literary associations of an entire generation. 
Matthew Arnold's point about the London Times's 
then arbitrary and whimsical spelling "diocess " was 
in no wise affected by the fact that Johnson's dic- 
tionary spelled it so. An hour or two in the British 
Museum would have acquainted Arnold with this 
fact, and with all the other facts which his critic 
flings at his head, had they been pertinent to his 
purpose. We read, then, with interest Professor 
Lounsbury's chapter on " Hono(u)r," his account of 
the variations between "er" and " re," and the other 
historical details with which he pads his argument. 
But we deny in toto their relevancy to the present 
issue. And we can only smile at the airs of triumph 
over men quite as scholarly as himself with which 
he exhibits to the people the particular wares of his 
own specialty. 

The same may he said of his scorn of the argu- 
ment for the preservation of etymology. It is easy, 
but superfluous, for him to show that this argument 
is often urged by those who know less of etymology 
than he does; that no absolute consistency is attain- 
able in the matter, and that any system of spelling 
will obscure some etymologies and reveal others. 
All this does not alter the fact that the general 
tendency of the innovations proposed is towards 
the obscuration of now transparent etymologies, 
and that this, though not a conclusive objection to 
demonstrated countervailing gains, is, so far as it 
goes, a consideration to be weighed with others, 
and cannot be magisterially dismissed or laughed 
out of court. 

If now we turn to larger questions of linguistic 
principle, there is much to give us pause. The plea 
is repeatedly made that a rational spelling will con- 
serve pronunciation. It would prevent the London 
newsboy from crying " pipers " and preserve the 
" Italian a " in the mouth of the Illinois " sucker." 
Professor Lounsbury's controversial eagerness here 
gets the better of his scientific conscience. A con- 
ceivable tendency of this kind no one is in a position 
to deny. But history lends it little support. Why 
in the thirteenth century did English "a" change 
to an O sound? Why did English "i," unequivo- 
cally denoted, change? How did it happen that 
almost the entire nicely discriminated and sufficiently 
designated Greek vowel and diphthong system lapsed 
into the monotonous e sound of modern Greek? 
The modern Greek boy is up against a much stiff er 
orthographical proposition (to speak by " prevailing 
usage ") than that which confronts his English con- 
temporary. But I should like to see the reception 
which educated Greeks would give to the proposal 
to relieve him by a simplified phonetic spelling. 
The Smeute caused by a too colloquial translation 
of the New Testament would be child's play in 
comparison. The Greeks know that it is this irra-

tional spelling which gives their language its 
inexhaustible resources, and makes it instead of a 
miserable patois one of the finest prose idioms of 
modern Europe. And they also know what Professor 
Lounsbury's a priori psychology of least resistance 
overlooks, that the time "wasted" in learning to spell 
is largely spent in the close scrutiny, assimilation, 
and discrimination of a vocabulary extending far 
beyond that of conversation. 

This pedagogical question, on which Professor 
Lounsbury finally rests his case, is far too complex 
to be settled by a few question-begging assertions. 
I do not deal in absolutes. The inconsistencies of 
our spelling doubtless cause some waste of mental 
effort ; but infinitely less than Professor Lounsbury 
assumes. And there are many counterbalancing 
considerations which he ignores. Correct spelling 
is mainly a matter of instinctive accuracy of visual 
observation, which good minds, with some startling 
exceptions, are apt to possess. For the large pro- 
portion of words outside the sphere of ordinary con- 
versation, it probably involves, even when most 
irrational phonetically, little more strain of attention 
than is actually helpful in the acquisition and dis- 
crimination of what we may call the literary vocab- 
ulary. Under any system, literate persons must 
learn to spell alike, unless Professor Lounsbury con- 
templates the perpetuation of the anarchy which, 
with Josh Billings, Mark Twain, and Professor 
Child, he recommends as a solvent of existing ortho- 
doxy and an affirmation of individuality. Under 
any system, there would be nearly as many bad 
spellers as under the present, and under any system 
the sufferings of congenital incapacity will be about 
the same. The assertion that the anomalies of the 
present system actually corrupt the logical sense is 
a jest. In our day, and in the domain of psychology 
or linguistics, the acceptance and artistic utilization 
of anomaly is a more desirable mental attitude than 
the blind faith in systematic and mechanical regular- 
ization which we are tempted to take into these fields 
from the physical sciences. There is neither regular- 
ity nor systematizing logic in idiom or semasiology. 
The logic of idiom is that of the gentleman who said 
'• Wherever I turn up I am turned down." There 
is no logical or ultimate etymological reason for the 
gradations of meaning in u esteem," " respect," 
•• veneration," or for the differentiation of " blame " 
and " blaspheme." If the anomalies of our spelling 
make English hard for foreigners, our prepositional 
idioms and the divergent meanings we give to words 
of Latin origin make it impossible. There is no 
space to elaborate the parallel. There is a type of 
mind which sees in its regularity of derivation and 
meaning a superiority of Esperanto over English. 
Shall we, then, organize a simplified board of 
semantic and synonyms, and convert English into 
Volapuk? Such irregularities, due to accidents of 
history and psychology, are the chief cause of the 
incomparable resources of our tongue. They are the 
delight of the student, and constitute the opportunity 



of the skilful writer — the scholar of Pater's defini- 
tion. These considerations would be far-fetched and 
absurd if urged in support of the wilful multiplica- 
tion of irregularities. But they are a legitimate 
answer to the contention that the study and accepts 
ance of linguistic anomaly is in itself detrimental to 
the youthful mind. And they suggest that even the 
anomalies of spelling may have, or be turned into, 
compensating advantages which a facile and a priori 
psychology of education overlooks. 

There are probably no conclusive and peremptory 
arguments on either side of this controversy. It is 
not a question of mathematical demonstration, but 
of the balancing of many nice and complex consid- 
erations, with a strong presumption in favor of 
conservatism in a matter at once too large and too 
delicate for conscious and prescriptive control. I 
have merely tried to show that the display of techni- 
cal erudition with which Professor Lounsbury would 
overawe the layman is not germane to the issue ; 
that the arguments which seem to him final admit 
of answer ; and that the absurdities which it pleases 
him to attribute to the conservatives are no essential 
part of the motives and reasons that determine their 
attitude. For the rest, in all charity, we commend to 
him the philosophy of Thersites : a He beats me and 
I rail at him : O worthy satisfaction ! would it were 
otherwise." p AUL Shobet.

not unlike the rarer experience of finding one's work 
a classic while one is still in a position to profit by 
it. Something like this must be the sensation 
enjoyed by Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. G. K. 
Chesterton, who, it appears, are just now so vital a 
part of London life that a presentment of it in fic- 
tion is hardly complete without one or both of them, 
and the novelist takes little risk in introducing 
them, and assuming his readers' readiness to catch 
the force of the allusions. To cite two recent 
instances, Mr. E. Temple Thurston, in " The City 
of Beautiful Nonsense," allows his heroine to mis- 
take a bailiff named Chesterton, whom she meets in 
the rooms of the impecunious hero, for u the Mr. 
Chesterton." and to him she begins quoting passages 
from G. K. C, supposing she is performing the 
neat but not novel trick of quoting an author to him- 
self ; while the bailiff, fired to emulation, promptly 
makes an epigram which in his opinion is quite as 
good as any of G. K. C.'s. Again, in Mr. "Wells's 
" Ann Veronica," the spectacled Suffragette and 
Intellectual, Miss Miniver, talks to Ann of Mr. 
Shaw and Mr. Chesterton, comparing them with 
half a dozen fictitious, or fictitiously named, re- 
formers ; and finally she and Ann go to Essex Hall 
to hear addresses by Shaw and the fictitious Fabi- 
ans. The curious thing is that the gentlemen can be

thus introduced into an imaginary company without 
incongruity, — or so we find it, — a fact which in- 
dicates an enveloping literary atmosphere that sel- 
dom lends its romantic glamour to inhabitants of 
this mundane sphere. Possible sources of the gla- 
mour we refuse even to speculate upon. Only Mr. 
Shaw could do justice to the subject, in a Preface 
— unless Mr. Chesterton would make a " Tremen- 
dous Trifle " of it, or add to " The Defendant " a 
Defence of Being a Literary Allusion.

A CURIOUS COMMENTARY ON THE METHODS OF 

publishers is offered by the appearance — sudden, 
unheralded, like an apparition from another world — 
of the " Last Poems " of George Meredith. Some 
fourteen hundred titles jostle one another on the Fall 
announcement lists of our leading publishing houses ; 
several hundred of them have been not merely an- 
nounced to the retail book-trade, but extensively 
advertised in advance to the public, who might 
reasonably have supposed that all the most tempting 
dainties in the season's feast of literature had been 
put before them to gloat over, anticipate, by-and-by 
to taste. And now there drops from the clouds a 
volume containing these " Last Poems " of George 
Meredith, bearing the imprint of a progressive house 
whose policy and practice are certainly not to sup- 
press its best enterprises — not to be, as Leigh Hunt 
aptly puts it, referring to some publishers of his day, 
" secreters," rather than publishers, of books. The 
explanation of this anomalous situation would seem 
to be that such an enormous number of books are 
produced nowadays, and the business of publishing 
them is so complicated a matter — so different from 
the manufacturing and marketing of more material 
wares — that confusion of aim and a lack of coor- 
dination in efforts for publicity are the inevitable 
results. But undoubtedly we shall enjoy Meredith's 
" Last Poems " as much as if we had long been 
anticipating them ; unexpected pleasures have a 
charm of their own. 

The North Pole in poetry cuts no great figure ; 
or, to change the metaphor a little, it does not cut 
much more ice in poetry than it does in prosaic 
reality. To be sure, we have Pope's couplet con- 
cerning certain persons who " speed the soft inter- 
course from soul to soul, and waft a sigh from Indus 
to the Pole "; and the lines in Barton Booth's old 
song, " True as the needle to the Pole, or as the dial 
to the sun "; and one of Isaac Watts's stanzas begins, 
" Were I so tall to reach the Pole, or grasp the ocean 
with my span "; and Coleridge has sung " Oh sleep ! 
it is a gentle thing, beloved from pole to pole "; and, 
finally, Addison once made a rhyme about the 
planets that " confirm the tidings as they roll, and 
spread the truth from pole to pole." After all, 
however, the imaginary termini of the earth's axis 
have not, either singly or taken together, done much 
toward kindling the poetic imagination; their asso- 
ciations are too cold and rigid. Any addition, there- 
fore, to this slender stock of Arctic allusion in verse 



becomes a matter of literary moment. The latest 
contribution is found in the beautifully appropriate 
poem with which Mrs. Howe so graciously favored 
the large audience gathered at the Metropolitan 
Opera House in the course of the late Hudson-Fulton 
celebration in New York. Her concluding stanza 
reads thus : 

" And, as one sun doth compass all 
That can arise or may befall, 
One sentence on Creation's night 
Bestowed the blessed boon of light, 
So shall all Life one promise fill 
Of gentle nurture and good will, 
While, pledging Love's assured control, 
The Flag of Freedom crowns the Pole." 

A PESSIMISTIC POET'S HOPELESS TASK Was that 

undertaken by the late John Davidson, the recent 
finding of whose body, together with the despairing 
preface to his posthumous volume of poems, con- 
firms the conjecture of his suicide. " For half a 
century," he once wrote, in a mood of supreme discon- 
tent, " I have survived in a world entirely unfitted 
for me ; and having known both the heaven and the 
hell thereof, and being without a revenue and an 
army and navy to compel the nations, I begin 
definitely in my Testaments and Tragedies to 
destroy this unfit world and make it over again in 
my own image," — truly a rather colossal enterprise. 
It was in the preface to the sheaf of poems which 
he went out to post to his publisher on the evening of 
March 23, the last time he was seen alive, that he 
wrote : " The time has come to make an end. There 
are several motives. I find my pension is not enough ; 
I have therefore still to turn aside and attempt things 
for which people will pay. My health also counts. 
Asthma and other annoyances I have tolerated for 
years ; but I cannot put up with cancer." It is not 
so very strange, even if it is very sad, that such a 
life should be thus ended. Having created the alter- 
native of making the world over again or leaving it, 
the tragic ending was inevitable. He was one of those 
who can do great things, but are powerless under the 
pressure of small things ; who are able to 

" Create new worlds without the least misgiving, 
But on this planet cannot make a living." 

A LAUREATESHIP ALMOST DECLINED, but finally 

accepted with reluctance, and only after a letter of 
refusal had actually been written, forms the most 
interesting topic of a Tennyson letter, never before 
published in full, which was read at the Lincoln cele- 
bration of the poet's centenary by Mr. Willingham 
F. Rawnsley, a friend of Tennyson's and a grand- 
son of the Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, to whom the letter 
was addressed. The passage referring to the 
proffered honor (and appearing only in part in Lord 
Tennyson's life of his father) reads as follows : " I 
thank you for your congratulations touching the lau- 
reateship. I was advised by my friends not to decline 
it, and I was even told that, being already in receipt 
of a pension, I could not gracefully refuse it ; but 
I wish more and more that some one else had it.

I have no passion for courts, but a great love of 
privacy ; nor do I count having the office as any par- 
ticular feather in my cap. It is, I believe, scarcely 
£100 a year, and my friend R. M. Milnes tells me 
that the price of the patent and court dress will 
swallow up all the first year's income." This sacri- 
fice of the first year's emoluments, however, was 
avoided, as the biography explains, by a loan (from 
Rogers) of the court dress worn by the preceding 
laureate. It is difficult for us now to conceive of 
Tennyson as uncrowned with the laurel wreath, but 
he came very near declining it — much nearer than 
most of his readers have ever suspected.

The Laurexce Sterxe of France is what 
some of his countrymen have called M. Anatole 
France ( to designate him by his familiar pen-name). 
A few sentences from Madame Ducleaux's new book 
(" The French Procession ") present the famous 
author in life-like fashion. She writes, with some 
incongruity of metaphor : " In 1888, when I came 
to live in Paris, I first met M. France. He was 
then a slender, youngish scholar of five-and-forty. 
appreciated rather than famous, whose literary gift 
still appeared elegant rather than great. His fine 
face, which since has assumed a glance of extraor- 
dinary power and penetration, wore an expression 
often gentle, sometimes mordant, more frequently 
veiled and ambiguous, and this uncertain air made the 
men and women of the world ( for whose society he 
showed the predilection of a satirist) somtimes com- 
plain that he had Vair perfide. What disconcerted 
them was the dim perception of a force in reserve; 
but it is possible to be both frank and mysterious ; M. 
France concealed nothing and disguised nothing ; he 
merely exceeded their comprehension — and perhaps 
at that time his own." The distinguished author's 
American readers, daily increasing in numbers with 
the appearance of his works in English, will look 
with interest for Madame Ducleaux's fuller account 

of him.

The best-sellixg book of philosopht that 
the publishing world has seen for many a day is 
undoubtedly Dr. William James's ■ Pragmatism." 
Published two years ago, this piquant treatment of 
things abstruse has already gone through eight edi- 
tions, and the demand is not yet satisfied. More- 
over, the book has been translated into Japanese 
and is said to be enjoying a brisk sale in the island 
kingdom, where its author is held in honor as a 
prophet Eight editions in two years would be a good 
record for a novel — for one of the philosopher's 
brother's novels, let us say. The old saying in regard 
to the James brothers, — that one of them wrote 
philosophy that was as fascinating as fiction, while 
the other wrote fiction that was as abstruse as phi- 
losophy, — seems to be having additional verifica- 
tion. * Pragmatism " and " The Will to Believe " 
are certainly books to render one oblivious of the 
passing of time ; and now a sequel to the later work 
has made its appearance under the title, ''The 



Meaning of Truth." Whether or not it answers 
satisfactorily Pilate's question of two thousand years 
ago will probably still remain largely a matter of 
individual opinion. ... 

The dyixg request of ax eccextric book- 
collector was once thus expressed in his will : " My 
wish is that my drawings, my prints, my curiosities, 
my books — in a word, those things of art which 
have been the joy of my life — shall not be consigned 
to the cold tomb of a museum and subjected to the 
stupid gaze of the careless passer-by ; but I direct 
that they all be dispersed again under the hammer 
of the auctioneer, so that the pleasure which the 
acquiring of each one of them has given me shall 
be given again, in each case, to some inheritor of my 
own tastes." This action of the testator (Edmond 
de Goncourt, who was of course much more than a 
collector of curios ) is called to mind by the wish of 
the late Robert Hoe, uttered before bis death, that 
his incomparable collection of books and manuscripts 
(partly catalogued, under 20,962 titles, in a fifteen 
volume privately-printed catalogue, and valued at a 
million dollars at least) should be sold at auction. 
This sale he even intended to effect in his lifetime — 
so it is reported. Whenever and wherever (prob- 
ably in London) it ultimately takes place, the sale 
will be a bibliopolic event of the first importance. 
... 

The abidixg love of good literature, of 
what may be called, in its less restricted sense, 
classic literature, is something to make one hopeful 
of the ultimate salvation of the race. Dime novels 
and penny dreadfuls do have their readers, it must 
be admitted ; but so do the excellent and inexpensive 
reprints of our best authors, of which a familiar 
example is " Everyman's Library." This wisely 
selected series now numbers four hundred volumes, 
and is thus in sight of the half-way mark in its 
steady progress toward the thousand- volume goal 
set for it. It is announced that five million volumes 
have already been sold, and that an additional 
hundred volumes will be published next year. Mr. 
Dent, the London publisher of the series, will soon 
visit this country, it is reported, to consult with some 
of our university professors and other educators as 
to future additions to this popular series of reprints.

THE DIA1 



[Nov. 1, 



FROM LITERARY LONDON. 



(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
There are various rumors afloat in London as to 
novels that would seem to be involving their authors 
and publishers in some measure of legal trouble. 
Mr. John Long, a comparatively recent addition to 
our publishing fraternity, seems to be frequently 
" in the wars." Just now the trouble is over a book 
entitled " A Native Wife," by Mr. Henry Bruce ; 
and as a result it has been withdrawn from circu- 
lation. The work presents a picture of a commercial 
representative of a great firm in India who marries 
a native and is ostracized by the whole white com- 
munity in consequence. The story, although charac- 
terized by much illiteracy, really shows remarkable 
knowledge of the by-ways of Indian life. The 
picture of the missionaries, presenting much sordid- 
ness mingled with undoubted ideals, strikes one as 
about the most accurate that has yet been given to 
the public. After an indictment which certainly 
presents the missionary in a peculiarly offensive 
light, Mr. Bruce acknowledges that the Christian- 
ized natives are one of the greatest factors in the 
preservation of the English connection. These com- 
munities, he says, scattered throughout India, are 
so many little islands, or oases, of political loyalty 
and of potential civilization. He lays great emphasis 
on the fact that this loyalty is produced in a very 
great degree by the work of American missionaries, 
who, he says, " show some of the best results." 
However, it would seem that Mr. Long has been 
taken to task by some native Indian lawyer who 
thinks he is presented in the pages of "A Native 
Wife." I cannot imagine, however, that this action 
for libel is of serious moment, or will ever come 
into court. 

I am sorry to note the extraordinary vogue in 
this country of what may be called abnormal fiction. 
Many so-called novels that are having large sales 
should never have been published at all. And novels 
are not the only offenders against taste. The innum- 
erable volumes of pretended historical reminiscences, 
court gossip, and vulgar tittle-tattle, compete for the 
doubtful honor of sensational preeminence. A fla- 
grant example may be found in the reminiscences of 
the Countess of Cardigan, which is having an extra- 
ordinary sale in England. It has gone through three 
editions here, and one bookseller has told me that he 
could have sold 500 more copies if he could have 
obtained them from the binders. Yet this is not due 
to any real newness in the book, for many of the best 
stories have been known in the smoking-rooms of 
English houses for years. The meretricious attrac- 
tion is, of course, in the fact that the stories are told 
by a woman, and a woman in society, who bears a 
name that counts for something in modern English 
history. Lord Cardigan was the hero of the Bala- 
clava Charge. It is said that while he led his troop 
into fire in that brilliant episode, which Tennyson 
has made forever memorable in his " Charge of the 



Light Brigade," he scuttled out again with too great 
quickness ; in fact, Lord Cardigan at one time 
threatened an action for libel against Kinglake 
for his version of the affair in his "History of the 
Crimean War," but the action never came into 
court. Of course it is of immense interest that Lord 
Cardigan's widow should print all these scandalous 
stories, and they are just now the talk of every table 
in London. 

The point at which interest undoubtedly centres, 
however, is Lady Cardigan's statement as to her 
having received a proposal of marriage from Lord 
Beaconsfield. Lord Beaconsfield, who for so many 
years was idolized by his own party and hated by the 
opposite party in this country to an extent that has 
scarcely a parallel save in the case of Gladstone, has 
now become a cult in which both parties unite ; and 
this although the primrose-day enthusiasm that was 
identified with his name for a few years appears to 
be dying out. Everyone is asking whether Lord 
Beaconsfield did really propose marriage to Lady 
Cardigan, the year after he lost the wife to whom he 
seemed to be so much devoted, — although he did once 
say of Lady Beaconsfield that she never knew which 
came first, the Greeks or the Romans. I believe I 
am right in saying that evidence of this will be forth- 
coming, and that Lady Cardigan's " Recollections " 
are to be followed by yet a second volume in which 
a facsimile of the letter wherein Disraeli proposed 
to her will be included. 

Of much more significance, if people had a real 
sense of relative importance with regard to books, 
is the new work on Byron that Mr. Richard Edg- 
cumbe has just issued in London through the firm 
of John Murray. Mr. Edgcumbe is quite the best 
living authority upon Byron. He is Sergeant-at- 
Arms to the King, and he is connected with the 
family of the poet Shelley in a collateral way, his 
mother having been a daughter of Sir John Shelley, 
the sixth Baronet. The poet Shelley, had he sur- 
vived his father, would have been the third Baronet. 
Mr. Edgcumbe was secretary to the National Byron 
Memorial Committee. He has written sundry small 
volumes, but nothing of anything like the importance 
of this new work, which he entitles "Byron: The 
Last Phase." In this book Mr. Edgcumbe has told 
over again the story of Byron's later life, — the 
greater and nobler Byron who died for Greece and 
freedom. There will, however, be more interest in 
the second and third part of Mr. Edgcumbe's vol- 
ume, treating of the debatable points in Byron's life 
which have been made the subject of so much con- 
troversy ever since Mrs. Beecher Stowe wrote about 
them in the " Atlantic Monthly " and " Macmillan's 
Magazine," a half -century ago. 

It will be remembered that a year or two before 
his death, Lord Lovelace, Byron's grandson, pub-

been offered ten ; but I fancy the book can now be 
obtained at its original price. Lord Lovelace took 
the precaution to copyright the book in America, 
having it set in type there and duly deposited in 
the Library of Congress. I was talking, only the 
other day, to the agent for American publications 
in London who arranged the matter. The book 
made me very angry ; and had it not been copy- 
righted, I should have liked to republish it with 
what I believe would have been a conclusive answer 
to Lord Lovelace's every point. The drawback to 
much of Mr. Edgcumbe's answer is that the people 
who read it will not have the book before them. 
The unhappy side of Mr. Edgcumbe's defence is 
that he also has to incriminate someone, the prin- 
cipal point of the story being that Byron did not 
fight when Lady Byron threatened divorce proceed- 
ings, because both he and his sister wished to shield 
Mary Chaworth, Byron's first love. It has never 
been known before, as clearly as Mr. Edgcumbe 
now shows it, that Byron renewed his intimacy with 
this lady after she became Mrs. Musters. Mr. 
Edgcumbe, I think, conclusively proves that Mrs. 
Musters was the mother of Byron's child Medora, 
and that his sister adopted the child. However, I 
must leave this book to your own reviewer.

THE HISTORICAL PAGEANT IN AMERICA. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

My attention has been called to an article in The 
Dial for October 16, on the subject of Historical 
Pageants. By some omission, which I take to be merely 
accidental, the article contains no reference to the 
pageant arranged in Philadelphia a year ago in connec- 
tion with the celebration of the 225th anniversary of the 
founding of that city. So far as I know, this continues 
to be as yet the only pageant of any size or importance 
ever given in this country. While it was not planned 
on the present very popular English pattern, as a play 
on the green, like the beautiful pageant at Quebec in 
July 1908, but rather followed the models of the Con- 
tinental European pageants, which take the form of pro- 
cessions, it was accounted by the 600,000 or 800,000 
people who were able to view it to be quite as faithful 
and artistic a presentation of the history of a great com- 
munity. It had the direction of excellent historians and 
artists who placed more than 5000 people in costume 
in a line which moved over a distance of five miles on 
Broad Street. The episodes chosen for representation 
began with the earliest settlements, carried the city 
through the Revolutionary War and the picturesque 
period following the war, through those twenty-five 
years when it was the capital of the United States, and 
ended with the Centennial Exhibition of 1876. 

The omission of Philadelphia from your list of his- 
torical pageants in this country is the more noticeable 
as you mention Lake Champlain and New York. There 
was no historical pageant at the Lake Champlain cele- 



bration, barring some Indian scenes which were largely 
fanciful. The city of Burlington, Vt., contemplated one, 
but was deterred by the expense. New York last month 
had the most abominable travesty upon the name of 
Historical Pageant that human ingenuity could invent. 
The New York " Evening Post " declared it to be 
tawdry, cheap, and entirely unworthy of the city ; while 
no one who witnessed the exhibition has been able to' 
speak of it with patience or toleration. I am sure that 
a journal like The Dial would not knowingly give its 
endorsement to pageantry which is arranged without 
regard to the principles of history or art. We have 
made a beginning in the right direction; and if our 
standards are not again lowered to the level of the car- 
nival and the secret-society parade, this entertainment 
may become an educational influence of the greatest 
popular value. Ellm Paxson Oberholtzer.

SOPHIE JEWETT — A TRIBUTE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The death, on the 11th of October, of Associate 
Professor Sophie Jewett of the Department of English 
Literature at Wellesley College brings poignant sense of 
loss to those whose number is itself a significant tribute. 
Gifted, lovely, with a spirit so " finely touched to all fine 
issues " that it seemed often a source of newer beauty, 
she was at once rarely beloved by friends and strangely 
memorable to those of even slight acquaintance. In 
twenty years of teaching she gave to several hundred 
students the inspiration of a scholarship as unsparing in 
its own endeavor as it was gracious and generous. Owing 
to its habit of abundant giving, it leaves but few tangible 
results. Nevertheless, an edition of Tennyson's " Holy 
Grail," singularly penetrative and thorough, and a mass 
of yet unpublished work on the ballads of Southern 
Europe, constitute a precious legacy. 

For about twenty years, also, Miss Jewett has been 
known as a poet whose lyrics, appearing at long inter- 
vals, mainly in " Scribner's " and " Harper's " maga- 
zines, were of exquisite craft and most delicate and 
inimitable music. In 1896 a number were brought 
together in "The Pilgrim" (Macmillan) ; in 1905 a 
second collection was made in " Persephone," a privately 
printed department publication; in 1908 appeared such 
a translation of the beautiful Middle-English poem 
" The Pearl " as only a poet's poet could have made. (A 
full review of this charming work appeared in The Dial 
of December 16, 1908.) Other poems of such late pub- 
lication as the April and August " Scribner's," 1909, or 
" The Outlook " for October 16, still wait their garland- 
ing. One is tempted to think of them in her own words 
for Sappho's verses: 

" Frail scattered petals, crimson, gold, 
Drift to the feet of you and me 
Unf aded, — even such vain, brief things 
(Roses of Paestnm, Helen's tears) 
As lover loves, and poet sings, 
And wise earth hoards through myriad years, 
Careless when some star disappears." 

As Meleager said of Sappho, these later " full-hearted " 
poems are " few, but roses all."

The Making of an African Explorer.* 



A brief entry in the late Henry M. Stanley's 
diary pictures, in a characteristic incident, the 
harsh training to which Fortune subjected him 
from infancy, to harden him into the most reso- 
lute, resourceful, and successful African ex- 
plorer of his day. The incident, a trifle in itself, 
took place in 1863, in Brooklyn, where young 

Stanley was boarding with Judge X . 

"Judge drunk," runs the record; "tried to 
kill his wife ; attempted three times. — I held 
him down all night. Next morning, exhausted; 
lighted cigar in parlor ; wife came down — 
insulted and raved at me for smoking in her 
house! " 

The autobiography of Sir Henry Morton 
Stanley, competently edited by Lady Stanley, 
is, in its first half, the detailed and pathetic 
account of the writer's homeless, loveless, harsh 
and cheerless boyhood and youth. Of course 
there were occasional gleams of sunshine, and 
some little taste of the milk of human kindness ; 
but it was, on the whole, such a barbarously 
inhuman discipline as not one in a thousand 
could have survived in any sort of physical or 
moral health. A father dead before the child 
was a month old ; a mother with no vestige of 
maternal love for her infant, whom she cast 
off at the earliest moment ; a workhouse up- 
bringing, under the rod of an atrociously cruel 
schoolmaster, who finally went raving mad ; 
wanderings and hardships in two hemispheres, 
with rough experience of army and navy service 
in time of war ; and, finally, the ups and downs 
of a roving journalist, — all these contributed 
to the toughening of fibre and the capacity for 
endurance that were to stand the future explorer 
of tropical Africa in such good stead. 

The date of Stanley's birth seems not to have 
been known to him ; at least he does not give it, 
and only in his seventh chapter do we find an 
approximate indication of the year. He speaks 
of himself as, in 1861, "getting close on to 
eighteen," which would make his birth-year 
1843. Most of the reference books give 1841, 
and even 1840 is the date assigned by one 
authority. That he was of Welsh extraction, 
and first saw the light of day near Denbigh, in 
Wales, appears to be certain. His consign-

ment to the care of a grandfather, who soon 
afterward died, and his subsequent haphazard 
course of life, up to his discharge from the 
U. S. Artillery service in the summer of 1862, 
a temporary physical wreck and without a 
penny in his pockets, are fully related in the 
unfinished autobiography. The rest of his life- 
history is pieced together, with the necessary 
editorial stitches, from Stanley's journals, notes, 
letters, and other writings. But as the world 
is already fairly familiar with these later and 
more historically important events and achieve- 
ments, the earlier and in many respects more 
humanly interesting and appealing incidents 
will here be chiefly dwelt upon. 

The most striking characteristics of the little 
workhouse boy whose many sorrows and very 
few joys are so touchingly told, are his moral 
earnestness, his blind faith in a loving God, his 
aching hunger for human affection, his intel- 
lectual quickness and vigor, his sturdy power of 
endurance, and the innate and unspoilable germ 
of goodness in his character. The inhuman 
schoolmaster whom he finally rebelled against 
and, with another boy's aid, soundly thrashed, 
before absconding never to return, is sufficiently 
depicted in the following paragraph : 

" Day after day little wretches would be flung down 
on the stone floor in writhing heaps, or stood, with blink- 
ing eyes and humped backs, to receive the shock of the 
ebony ruler, or were sent pirouetting across the school 
from a ruffianly kick, while the rest suffered from a 
sympathetic terror during such exhibitions, for none 
knew what moment he might be called to endure the 
like. Every hour of our lives we lived and breathed 
in mortal fear of the cruel hand and blighting glare of 
one so easily frenzied." 

Disposed to view the accidents of his life- 
course as providentially ordered for the ulti- 
mate bringing about of things not altogether 
unmemorable, the autobiographer thus refers to 
his treatment at the hands of a hard-featured 
and close-fisted aunt upon whose tender mercies 
he had thrown himself after running away from 
the workhouse and its brutal teacher of youth : 

" To her own children, Aunt Mary was the best of 
mothers. Had I received but a tithe of her affection, 
I fear that, like an ass partial to his crib, I should have 
become too home-loving to leave. As Jacob served 
Laban, I would have served aunt for years, for a mere 
smile, but she had not interest enough in me to study 
my disposition, or to suspect that the silent boy with a 
somewhat dogged look could be so touched by emotion. 
What I might have become with gracious treatment her 
youngest son David became. He clung to his mother's 
hearth, and eventually married the daughter of Jones, 
of Hurblas, by whom he had a large family. All his 
life he remained profoundly ignorant that beyond his 
natal nook the universe pulsed deep and strong, but, as

the saying is, ' Home-keeping youth hath ever homely 
wits,' and gain and honour are not for those who cling 
to their firesides." 

After a dreary experience as an overworked 
and underfed shop-boy in Liverpool, the lad 
found a berth for himself, in a menial capacity, 
on a sailing vessel bound for New Orleans. 
Every order he received, as soon as seasickness 
abated enough to let him stagger on deck, was 
accompanied with an oath and likely also to be 
attended or preceded by a blow. The sub- 
joined bit of narrative and reflection is signifi- 
cant. 

" From this date began, I think, the noting of a strange 
coincidence, which has since been so common with me 
that I accept it as a rule. When I pray for a man, it 
happens that at that moment he is cursing me; when I 
praise I am slandered; if I command [commend?], I 
am reviled; if I feel affectionate or sympathetic towards 
one, it is my fate to be detested or scorned by him. I 
first noticed this curious coincidence on board the 
' Windermere.' I bore no grudge, and thought no evil 
of any person, but prayed for all, morning and evening, 
extolled the courage, strength, and energy of my ship- 
mates, likened them to sea-lions, and felt it an honour 
to be in the company of such brave men; but, invariably, 
they damned my eyes, my face, my heart, my soul, my 
person, my nationality ; I was damned aft, and damned 
forward. I was wholly obnoxious to everyone aboard, 
and the only service they asked of God towards me was 
that He should damn me to all eternity." 

Nevertheless the object of all this vituperation 
continued to bless them that cursed him and to 
pray for them which despitefully used him and 
persecuted him. He wasted no time cherishing 
either real or fancied grievances, but pushed on 
to better things with a pluck and courage that 
were bound to conquer an adverse fate in the end. 
The fact that Sir Henry Morton Stanley was 
born plain John Rowlands, son and grandson of 
men of the same name, will be new to some 
readers. It was from a well-to-do and benevo- 
lent tradesman of New Orleans, who recognized 
the boy's worth and adopted him, that he got 
his name, Henry Stanley. Nothing is said to 
account for the Morton ; possibly it too formed 
a part of the benefactor s name. The short 
season of paternal kindness that brought the 
waif's better nature to a rapid development was 
ended by the sudden death of Mr. Stanley, 
intestate, and the casting once more adrift of the 
young wanderer. His subsequent varied experi- 
ences, his abhorrence of the inhumane treatment 
of slaves, but nevertheless his impulsive adop- 
tion of the cause unfavorable to their emanci- 
pation, and his terrific initiation into the art of 
war at Shiloh, with his subsequent capture and 
confinement at Camp Douglas, on the outskirts 
of Chicago, are graphically and stirringly related. 



It was the raw recruit's too eager advance to 
meet the enemy that led to his capture and his 
later unspeakable experience of prison horrors. 
Of the latter he writes : 

" The statistics of Andersonville are beheved to show 
that the South was even more callous towards their 
prisoners than the authorities of Camp Douglas were. 
I admit that we were better fed than the Union pris- 
oners were, and against Colonel Milligan and Mr. 
Shipman I have not a single accusation to make. It 
was the age that was brutally senseless, and heedlessly 
cruel. It was lavish and wasteful of life, and had not 
the least idea of what civilized warfare ought to be, 
except in strategy. It was at the end of the flint-lock 
age, a stupid and heartless age, which believed that the 
application of every variety of torture was better for 
discipline than kindness, and was guilty, during the war, 
of enormities that would tax the most saintly to forgive." 

The practical certainty of death in this disease- 
infected prison, together with a friendly and 
convincing presentation of the Federal side of 
the pending controversy from one of the officers 
in charge, finally induced Stanley to obtain his 
freedom by swearing allegiance to the Union 
and enlisting in the artillery service. But the 
seeds of disease were already in his system, and 
his only experience of warfare in the newly- 
adopted cause came some months later in the 
navy, where he was more concerned with watch- 
ing and reporting for publication the progress 
of events, than with taking an enthusiastic part 
in shaping them. After all, it was no quarrel 
of his, and after fighting and suffering for the 
South he may well have found it hard to kindle 
the same degree of ardor for the North. Thence- 
forth, at any rate, it is as a roving press reporter, 
and an adventurous explorer of strange lands, 
that he finds outlet for his indomitable energy ; 
and his course from this point has been some- 
what closely followed by the reading public. 
Nevertheless, the old story, or a small part of 
the old story, of his meeting with Livingstone 
may here bear re-telling. 

•• My mission to find Livingstone was very simple, and 
was a clear and definite aim. All I had to do was to free 
my mind from all else, and relieve it of every earthly 
desire but the finding of the man whom I was sent to 
seek. To think of self, friends, banking-account, life- 
insurance, or any worldly interest but the one sole pur- 
pose of reaching the spot where Livingstone might 
happen to rest, could only tend to weaken resolution. 
Intense application to my task assisted me to forget 
all I had left behind, and all that might lie ahead in 
future. . . . 

" Our meeting took place on the 10th November, 
1871. It found him reduced to the lowest ebb in for- 
tune by his endless quest of the solution to the problem 
of that mighty river Lualaba, which, at a distance of 
three hundred miles from Lake Tanganyika, flowed 
parallel with the lake, northward. In body, he was, as 
he himself expressed it, ' a mere ruckle of bones.'

[Nov. 1, 



" The effect of the meeting was a rapid restoration to 
health ; he was also placed above want, for he had now 
stores in abundance sufficient to have kept him in Ujiji 
for years, or to equip an expedition capable of solving 
within a few months even that tough problem of the 
Lualaba. There was only one thing wanting to com- 
plete the old man's happiness — that was an obedient 
and tractable escort. Could I have furnished this to 
him there and then, no doubt Livingstone would have 
been alive to-day [this was written in 1885], because, 
after a few days' rest at Ujiji, we should have parted — 
he to return to the Lualaba, and trace the river, per- 
haps, down to the sea, or until he found sufficient proofs 
that it was the Congo, which would be about seven hun- 
dred miles north-west of Nyangwe ; I journeying to the 
East Coast." 

The occupations and interests of the explorer 
after retiring to the enjoyment of domestic life 
at Furze Hill, together with his parliamentary 
experience and other matters, sustain the in- 
terest of the volume to its closing page and the 
death of Stanley in 1904. The whole is told, 
with a few intercalations and additions, by his 
own pen; for he was a copious diarist. "Thoughts 
from Note-books " form a supplementary chap- 
ter, followed by an index and a map illustrating 
his three African journeys. The numerous por- 
traits, including nine of Stanley and one of 
Lady Stanley, and other illustrations, are good. 
Despite the rather bitter philosophical reflec- 
tions that sprinkle its pages — reflections that 
tend to show the writer as rather too constantly 
" on the edge of resentment " (to quote a phrase 
of his own), and that indicate some unwhole- 
some brooding over past wrongs — as where he 
says of reviewers that " the Reviewer is either 
fulsome, or he is a bitter savage, striking stupidly 
because of blind hate " — the book is nothing 
short of absorbing in its interest. Stanley's lit- 
erary style, as is already known, has the charm 
of clearness, vigor, and grace, with occasional 
unexpected felicities in apt quotation or well- 
chosen epithet. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Poet as Dramatist.* 



It seemed a notable event, a year or so ago, 
when it appeared that Mr. William Vaughan 
Moody had written a successful play. That Mr. 
Moody should write beautiful poetry, was some- 
thing to be thankful for. I remember still the 
freshness of the impression with which I discov- 
ered, on opening " The Masque of Judgment," 
that instead of being a normal and respectable

Vaughan Moody. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



drama in verse, it was really a dramatic poem 
with strange powers of stirring, thrilling, en- 
lightening. That impression I still believe to 
have been right ; for on looking at the book 
again, I feel much the same way about it. But 
a dramatic poem was one thing, and a play for 
the stage was another, — as has often been 
urged, and indeed proved, by the authority of 
the box-office as well as of the critic. So it had 
not appeared improbable that Mr. Moody might 
find himself unable to do what even Browning 
and Tennyson, for instance, had not succeeded 
in doing. But unquestionably " The Great Di- 
vide " has been very successful on the stage, 
and, although brought out two years ago, it is 
still presented. Mr. Moody then wrote " The 
Faith Healer," which has had a less favorable 
presentation on the stage. Both plays, how- 
ever, have been published, and invite the con- 
sideration of those who read as well as of those 
who go to the theatre. 

Once must say at once that they are both 
extremely interesting. I prefer " The Masque 
of Judgment " myself, when it comes to read- 
ing : doubtless I should prefer " The Great 
Divide" on the stage. These new plays are 
written in prose, whereby Mr. Moody seems to 
give up his most wonderful power. But these 
changes are rather a necessity, and one should 
not quarrel with them. If a man is going to 
write for our stage to-day, it seems useless for 
him to try to write the kind of play that was 
successful three hundred years ago. I cannot 
feel that Mr. Phillips's poems are successful on 
the stage. If one speak of " Cyrano de Ber- 
gerac " or " The Sunken Bell," I must admit 
that I have little to say, except that they were 
produced under other influences and other tra- 
ditions than those of our stage. In spite of 
these, it still seems a bit of tour-de-force for 
one to create a great success in poetry on the 
stage, at least on the American stage. As a 
rule, our dramatists cannot even do the thing 
in prose. However that may be, Mr. Moody 
has written his plays in prose, and in prose we 
must read him or pass him by for the present^ 

A prose play, then, is what we have, — or,\ 
rather, two such plays, one of an Eastern girl 
gone west, the other of a religious enthusiast. 
Perhaps poetry would not do for such subjects : 
Mr. Moody wanted to deal with the life which 
had impressed him, with the life of to-day that 
we know, with the life of our own people and 
country. Probably it seemed to him that verse 
was out of the question. These things, he may 
have felt, demand the simplicity and the realism 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



331 



of prose. Mr. Mackaye might have used verse 
had he chosen, when he wrote " The Scarecrow," 
for that was a legendary tale of old New Eng- 
land. Mr. Clyde Fitch might have thought fit 
to write " Nathan Hale " in verse, for his story 
there came out of our own hero-period. Neither 
did so ; and perhaps one would hardly expect a 
man who is writing of to-day even to think of it. 

Mr. Moody, then, is severely realistic in his 
form. Nor does he seize every advantage that 
he might ; there was perhaps elaborate scenery 
of mountain and canyon in the second act of 
" The Great Divide," but " The Faith Healer " 
is set entirely in the main room of a " farm- 
house near a small town in the Middle West." 
Still, the plays are the work of a poet ; and 
that, I believe, will constitute their great interest 
to the reader to-day. Mr. Moody puts away 
from him all the help of stimulating figure and 
picture, — all that belongs elsewhere, he may 
think, — and finds or makes his poetry in the 
simple power of his conception. That is a great 
victory. 

I am not well versed in stage technique, and 
should hesitate to offer an opinion as to how 
much of it there may be in Mr. Moody's plays. 
Of what is called dramatic construction, there 
seems to me only just enough. In " The Great 
Divide," an Eastern girl in the West, in romantic 
sympathy with its unfinished bigness, is carried 
off by a man who happens in upon her when she 
is alone, much as a Dacotah in Parkman's day 
might have carried off a squaw. The man mar- 
ries her, and is successful in a gold-mine he has ; 
but they fail to find entire happiness, and she 
leaves him and goes to her old home. Our 
sympathies are with them ; we wish them to 
make a success of life. There is the crucial 
point : things are at their worst ; how are they 
to get right, if indeed they ever do? Her hus- 
band comes East after her ; she appreciates him 
at his true worth, and they go back out West 
again — beyond the Great Divide. There is here, 
I suppose, enough dramatic construction for the 
stage. At the end of the first act the question 
is proposed ; at the end of the second (where 
Ruth leaves her husband) it is at its farthest 
from solution. At the end of the play the 
question is solved. At the theatre one does not 
always demand explanations, if the action and 
dialogue are good. 

ut in reading, we ask, Why should she have 
left him? and then, Why does she come back 
to him, or, rather, let him come to her ? Mr. 
Moody, of course, provides answers to these ques- 
tions ; his characters are by no means without

---bS 



motives. But I feel sure that many, even of 
those who saw the play, had little conception 
of just what those motives were ; indeed, I can- 
not be absolutely certain that after reading the 
play I know just how the final event is brought 
about. 

In " The Faith Healer " I believe this criticism 
is yet more applicable. In that play we have 
a religious enthusiast of wonderful spiritual 
power : he has raised the dead. In the family 
where he is staying for a time, he meets a woman, 
and they love each other. At that, his spiritual 
power seems to wane ; and fearing that it is she 
who is at fault, she resolves to leave him. In 
the last act, as in "The Great Divide," the two 
understand each other, and his spiritual power 
returns. Here too the theatrical points, as we 
may call them, are definite ; we watch with pain- 
ful interest the ebb and flow of spiritual power. 
But why the ebb and why the flow? 

I would not suggest that Mr. Moody is not 
definite in his own mind in each play. The 
reason for the reader's vagueness (if I may 
judge others by myself) comes from the nature 
of the means that he chooses. In " The Great 
Divide " the means lie in the particular spiritual 
nature of Ruth ; in " The Faith Healer," in the 
particular spiritual nature of Michaelis. Indefi- 
nite matters these, such as the poet understands 
sufficiently for his purpose, but which the aver- 
age reader may not always comprehend. 

In one of the plays, a matter-of-fact person 
says : " Mystery ! . . . You women would live 
on it if we 'd let you ! " And Rhoda answers, 
" Whether you let us or not, we do live on it, 
and so does the whole world." I believe that 
accounts for Ruth too. I doubt if her husband 
ever understood just the reasons that led her 
from loathing to love ; probably he was quite 
content not to understand, so long as he knew. 
Perhaps we may be content to do something of 
the same sort. Mr. Moody discerns currents of 
influence and of power that guide the world, and 
in his plays he presents them. There are many 
who will instinctively apprehend and respond to 
such things. We are not to imagine that Ruth 
is merely fickle, with one whim one day and 
another the next ; that Michaelis is merely an 
emotionalist, with his seasons of exaltation and 
depression. These people are inerrantly led by 
powers that they recognize even if they do not 
understand. 

Nor are such motives really inferior dramatic 
means. They may be, on the other hand, the 
very best means, — easily better than all the 
clever contrivances that would be obvious enough

on the stage or in a book. Provided always that 
they be true to life ; and here one must have con- 
fidence in one's poet. Doubtless we should not 
have confidence in everyone. Mr. Moody says 
to us, People act and feel so and so. That is 
the way with the artist ; he almost of necessity 
takes the classic position of Turner, with the 
person who did not see nature as he did : " Don't 
you wish you could ? " Personally, I often wish 
I did, though it is more convenient from day to 
day if one can understand the more obvious 
things of the daily round. But it is refreshing 
now and then to get a glimpse of the other thing. 
There is much else in the plays worth men- 
tioning — perhaps even with praise or blame, 
though Mr. Moody presumably intends to go on 
his way without much regard to either. So I 
will speak of nothing else ; all the rest is, as 
Verlaine said long since, merely literature.

The Literary History of Rome.* 



Mr. Wight Duff's " Literary History of 
Rome " does not present formal catalogues of 
facts, arranged especially for reference work, 
like a Teuffel-Schwabe ; nor give convenient 
bird's-eye views of men and movements, like 
the lesser American manuals of Lawton and 
Fowler ; nor contain extended studies of par- 
ticular phases, after the manner of a Sellar, a 
Nettleship,ora Boissier ; nor arouse the reader's 
enthusiasm like the glowing appreciations of a 
Mackail ; but it is a book which is better than 
any single one of these, because it combines and 
unifies to no inconsiderable degree the virtues 
of all of them. The reader may well regret 
that it carries him only to the end of the 
Augustan Age. All things considered, if it 
were continued to the close of the Empire, it 
would be the one work on the subject in any 
language which neither specialist nor layman 
could afford to omit from his library. Ending 
even as it does in mediis rebus, it is none the 
less valuable for the period it covers. It is a 
summing up of scholarship to date on the history 
and appreciation of a great historic literature 
through its most interesting and significant 
phases. 

Professor Duff's work is written by a scholar 
who possesses wonderful patience and rare

mastery over material, has not spared himself 
in his efforts, and has allowed himself the space 
requisite for the unmutilated and uncompressed 
presentation of his subject, without, however, 
presuming upon the privilege ; for he is a model 
of terseness and concentration. He will appeal 
most to the specialist audience — to teachers and 
advanced students. His foot-notes are filled with 
special information : extensive lists of editions, 
in themselves comprising brief sketches of text- 
ual history ; citations of authorities covering the 
results of scholarship in all the phases allied to 
literature ; abundance of quotation from Latin 
writers, enabling the scholar to test for himself 
the author's conclusions. 

Nor is the body of the page less replete with 
scholarly matter ; if Professor Duff has sinned 
at all, it is in having presented too much, rather 
than too little. Perhaps an approved history of 
Roman literature ought to carry along with it 
the vast bulk of uninteresting detail about 
authors who were in their own time obscure 
representatives of minor movements, and who 
are known now only by name, or at most by 
fragments preserved in unliterary connections by 
later grammarians and other unliterary special- 
ists. If this is true, it must be on the theory that, 
in the treatment of a far-away period like Roman 
antiquity, absolutely nothing is negligible. The 
reader is tempted to think, as he labors through 
some parts of the work — notably the careful 
pages dealing with the lesser dramatists, the 
annalists, Alexandrinism, and other examples of 
the unknown and unadored — that the author 
has shed his ink on the pertinent and imperti- 
nent alike ; and feels like turning on him with 
his own sensible statement a propos of Livy's 
omissions : " Livy produced a much more real 
impression by avoiding the boredom of pedantic 
tmnuticB." 

We may let that pass, however: perhaps it 
is as well for an author to be on the safe side — 
especially as his reviewer himself may have made 
his reputation by sagacious treatment of the 
unessential. Professor Duff's book fortunately 
contains also a wealth of the essential, such as 
may be found in no other work on the subject ; 
and this fits it for the wider circle (who may 
omit the less significant portions if they choose), 
as well as for the specialist. He pursues a con- 
sistent and effective method : sketching first the 
character of the times and the author's environ- 
ment ; then narrating, in a finely sympathetic 
spirit, his life experience ; discussing next his 
works, in chronological order, and in a manner 
which, in a work of this size, may be termed 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



333 



exhaustive ; and concluding with a critical 
estimate which is the best feature of the book. 
Those who wish to test the truth of this will 
do well to turn to the author's treatment of 
Plautus, Catullus, Cicero, Virgil, or, best of all, 
Horace. Even the less known in letters, as 
Ennius and Cato, are made to stand forth with 
remarkable distinctness, both as literary char- 
acters and men. For all the multitude of detail, 
the author succeeds in unifying the impression, 
and makes of the subjects of his sketches living 
Personalities. His summaries of literary appre- 
ciation are packed with detail, and noteworthy 
for richness. It is not often that the much 
in little is so well exemplified as in the explana- 
tion of the universality of Horace's appeal in 
pp. 534-545. 

This prompts a further summary of Professor 
Duff's good qualities. His scholarship is broad 
and deep : he not only gives a full account of 
literature itself, but harmonizes and unifies his 
work as a whole by painting in the linguistic, 
political, and religious background. His famil- 
iarity with modern literature also serves him and 
his readers well ; it is with rare pleasure that 
one happens on the terse and facile allusions in 
his pages : pedantic Varro's seventy hebdomads 
are "the forgivable sum of seventy times seven"; 
the bargeman in Horace sings of the girl he left 
behind him — absentem nt cantat amicam; 
Ovid, " the idle singer of an empty day, ; ' died 
in exile, " heart-sick of hope deferred.*' 

To his knowledge add brotherly kindness : he 
is sympathetic. He likes his subject, and is on 
friendly terms with the men he introduces. And 
to his brotherly kindness add temperance. He 
sees their shortcomings, and does not curtly 
condemn and dismiss ; he sees their virtues, and 
does not let enthusiasm blind him. 

This means simply that he is sane and well 
balanced ; he follows the golden mean by nat- 
ural inclination rather than mere calculation. 
He knows the artificiality of Virgil's Eclogues, 
and the Homeric reflex in the iEneid ; but real- 
izes that this is only on the surface, and that the 
Mantuan's love of nature in the garden of the 
world, and the Roman quality of the story of 
^Eneas, are none the less genuine. He recog- 
nizes that Plautus drew from Greek Comedy, 
but makes us see the essentially Italian nature 
of the product. He can charge Cicero with 
vanity and redundancy, without causing the 
reader to despise the great Roman for it ; he 
admits that the orator was not a poet of the first * 
class, but has the sense to commend his verse 
for the good qualities it does display, and the 



courage to suggest the "true view that Cicero ia 
a vivacious and tasteful intermediary who trans- 
mitted to Lucretius and Catullus the ancient 
Latin versification enhanced in dignity, and, 
still more decidedly, in technique." He appre- 
ciates the practical and the scientific aspect of 
the poem of Lucretius, but knows that the poetic 
and spiritual are what determine its real char- 
acter. He can see that Caesar had a great mind 
and a great heart, without attributing to him 
either sublime patriotism or divine foresight in 
his teens. His sanity and balance find especially 
clear expression in his comparisons : Horace and 
Catullus, Cicero and Livy, etc. 

Most of all are these qualities seen in the 
author's insistence on the national character 
of Latin literature. He will not hear to the 
facile dismissal of Latin letters, and Roman art 
in general, as mere Hellenistic products, — a 
view in which Latin scholarship has been wont 
to acquiesce. He will give all due credit to 
Hellenic influence, but not without maintaining 
that the Greek and Roman literatures are 
separately animated expressions ; with Franz 
Wickhoff and Mrs. Strong, he contributes at 
the same time to justice and good sense by 
asserting the Italian nature of Roman art. 
This, and the historical importance of the Latin 
language and literature, are the two large lessons 
of the book. 

The English versions with which Professor 
Duff enlivens his work afford no small pleasure 
to the reader, who is courteously given the oppor- 
tunity to judge of their excellence by compari- 
son with the Latin original at the bottom of the 
page. His versions of both poetry and prose 
are noteworthy for accuracy and good taste. The 
lines from Pacuvius and Catullus, Vivamus, 
mea Lesbia, and the neat sonnet translation of 
Lugete, O Veneres, are examples of his clever- 
ness. In Horace he is not so felicitous, — but 
that might be expected in the case of an author 
who is universally recognized as "the type of 
the untranslatable." 

But nihil est ab omni parte beatum. After 
the noting of all these excellences of the book, it 
will cause surprise and regret to be told that a 
sense of monotony in style insists on rising into 
the reader's consciousness as often as momentary 
flagging of interest in the subject-matter gives 
it opportunity, and is indeed never very far 
from the surface. The author's nervous quick- 
ness, clarity, and straightforwardness are admir- 
ably adapted to occasional detailed characteriza- 
tion, or to the rapid fire of learned minutice ; 
but for narrative and criticism the style does

not flow enough ; the sentences are simple and 
clear, but do not fuse ; the reader is not carried 
in a current, but advances on foot, and is too 
often conscious of the sound of his steps. There 
is great dearth not only of colons, semi-colons, 
and commas, — which, of course, do not of 
themselves give forth virtue, — but also of the 
streaming quality of which they should be the 
sign ; and in the use of connectives, which more 
than anything else gives Ciceronianism its mag- 
nificent onward sweep, Professor Duff either 
disbelieves or is unpractised. It is not without 
significance that he selects for translation from 
the second Philippic a passage containing few 
connectives, and omits to render part of those. 
He is consistent and natural, but consistency is 
not a jewel which fits every setting. 

This may seem captious, but the defect is 
unfortunate, even though numerous virtues com- 
bine to cover it. As the author himself tells us 
in connection with Ovid, " The world always 
listens to a story well told." Many an admirer 
of this excellent work who is sensitive to the 
style that shoots forth peculiar graces will be 
tempted to praise Professor Duff's long and 
scholarly history, and read some less exhaustive 
one of more conciliating style. A ton of marble 
rough-hewn is a valuable possession, but it is 
worth a great deal more when finished into a sta- 
tue. However, not everyone can be a Praxiteles.

Two Great Masters of English 
Poetry.* 



The two most important periods of our poetic 
literature, it will hardly be denied, are the age 
of Shakespeare and the age of Wordsworth ; and 
the two most significant poets in these periods 
are those who give them their names. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that out of eleven lectures 
the Professor of Poetry at Oxford should devote 
four each to these periods, the remaining three 
being of a general character. Shakespeare 
admittedly is inexhaustible ; and readers and 
critics are finding Wordsworth more and more 
worthy of profound study. Professor Bradley's 
keen and illuminating work on " Shakespearean 
Tragedy " showed how much there was to be 
said on Shakespeare's best-known plays, after 
all these years of criticism ; and now two of 
his lectures, " The Rejection of Falstaff " and 
" Antony and Cleopatra," treat familiar themes

LL.D., Litt.D. New York : The Maemillan Co. 



in a fresh and interesting fashion. The other 
two lectures, " Shakespeare the Man " and 
" Shakespeare's Theatre and Audience," are 
rather an entertaining re-statement of facts than 
a new contribution to scholarship. The same 
penetration that gave us one of the most admir- 
able and sympathetic studies of " Hamlet " has 
given us here equally successful appreciations 
of Falstaff and Cleopatra, perhaps the three 
most remarkable characters in the whole Shake- 
spearean gallery. The various theories to ac- 
count for the rejection of Falstaff are fairly 
discussed, and, after a full consideration of the 
characters of the Prince and the Knight, are 
overthrown. Even the very clever suggestion of 
the German Roetscher, that Sir John's remark, 
" Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound," 
is a final stroke of wit, showing his superiority 
to the King's rebuff — this too has to go by the 
board. Much as we should like to be virtuous 
with Henry and happy with Falstaff, we are 
forced to see in the latter's commitment to the 
Fleet and his subsequent death something that 
is far from being a joke. Shakespeare, as Pro- 
fessor Bradley contends, has here overreached 
himself ; he has made the character so excellent 
in its humor that he could by no devices remove 
the spell he has woven round the admirers of 
the fat old knight. He cannot make us believe 
him to be the rascally reprobate our colder 
reason assures us he is. "Our hearts go out 
to Falstaff, to the Fleet, or, if necessary, to 
Arthur's bosom, or wheresomever he is." The 
case of Falstaff is something like that of 
Cleopatra. With all her grievous faults, those 
which belong to her as a sort of " sublimated 
Doll Tearsheet," which we must condemn with- 
out being puritanical, she never for a moment 
loses her eternal fascination for us. The end of 
Falstaff does not fulfil Shakespeare's intention, 
for we ought not to feel sorrow at Sir John's 
fate ; whereas we do, so completely has he won 
our affections. 

There are certain traits of character which 
Professor Bradley points out as common to both 
Falstaff and Cleopatra, strange as it may at 
first sight appear. She is vain, and so is he ; 
and in the second interview with the Messenger 
she is comic. She carries all before her, as Sir 
John does ; and yet her empire, like his, is built 
on sand. " Finally, as his love for the Prince 
gives dignity and pathos to Falstaff in his 
overthrow, so what raises Cleopatra at last into 
pure tragedy is, in part, that which some critics 
have denied her, her love for Antony." It is 
the combination of splendid qualities with vulgar

ones that makes her the wonderful creation she 
is, and that puts this play in a different class 
from any one of the great tragedies. We can- 
not regret that she and her lover did not gain 
the world, as we do in the case of Hamlet, or 
Othello, or even Romeo. And this is not due 
so much to the illicit nature of their love as to 
the fact that they " come before us in a glory 
already tarnished, half ruined by their past." 
Their love has not the certitude of permanence ; 
neither trusts the other fully. Never was such 
love so gloriously presented ; but when the 
glory dies away, it does not leave us mourning. 
The criticism is well taken, that the fact that 
we mourn so little saddens us. The triumph 
of the lovers is complete, and we feel that life 
cannot offer them what it might offer the great 
tragic heroes and heroines. 

That Wordsworth is the most sublime of our 
poets since Milton, is the contention Professor 
Bradley maintains in the greater part of his 
lecture on Wordsworth. He insists that the 
mystic, visionary, sublime aspect of Words- 
worth's poetry must not be slighted. And the 
sublime Professor Bradley defines in a lecture 
on that subject included in this volume as the 
image of the boundlessness of the Infinite, " its 
rejection of any pretension to independence or 
absoluteness on the part of its finite forms." 
It is just such a conception of the sublime that 
Wordsworth illustrates in the lines descriptive 
of his descent of the Alps : the torrents, crags, 
and winds 

" Were all like workings of one mind, the features 
Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree : 

Characters of the great Apocalypse, 
The types and symbols of Eternity, 
Of first, and last, and midst, and without end." 

And this sublimity is associated in Words- 
worth's case with the mountains and with soli- 
tude, Professor Bradley remarks. Yes, it is 
largely true ; but " Tintern Abbey " is evidence 
that other scenes than the mountains or other 
conditions than absolute solitude may call forth 
" an aspect more sublime "; 

" that blessed mood, 

In which the burthen of the mystery, 

In which the heavy and the weary weight 

Of all this unintelligible world, 

Is lightened." 

But he was preeminently the poet of the moun- 
tains ; here " he felt his faith," just as Byron 
was the poet of the sea. So he is likewise and 
inevitably the poet of solitude. " Lucy Gray " 
has the mystic touch that marks it off from 
certain trivial verses included in the " Lyrical 
Ballads." On the other hand, to give a sub- 



lime significance to " Alice Fell," as Professor 
Bradley tries to do, seems very hard. Her 
grief is not unbounded, as sublime grief must 
be, since a few shillings dry all her tears. 

Other lectures are upon " Poetry for Poe- 
try's Sake," " The Sublime," " Hegel's Theory 
of Tragedy," "Shelley's View of Poetry," 
" The Long Poem in the Age of Wordsworth," 
and the " Letters of Keats." As a whole, the 
book is worthy of its author and of his profes- 
sorship. James W. Tupper. 



New Light on the Religious Wars 
rx France.* 



For nearly a generation, Professor Henry M. 
Baird s " Rise of the Huguenots " has remained 
the most detailed and reliable treatment in 
English of the earlier fortunes of the French 
Protestants. Meanwhile the literature of the 
subject has been enriched in France by the pub- 
lication of many important monographs, of 
memoirs and biographies, of collections of state 
and family papers, and especially of the studies 
of hundreds of particular questions in the suc- 
cessive "Bulletins de la Societe du Protestant- 
isme franqais^ To make the results of this 
vast inquiry available for the comprehension 
of the period between 1559 and 1576, and at 
the same time to present the conclusions of his 
own independent investigations, is the aim of 
Professor Thompson's volume on " The Wars of 
Religion in France." He brings the narrative 
to an end with an account of the Peace of Mon- 
sieur in 1576, because he believes the war then 
ceased to be distinctively " religious "and be- 
came political. 

Over this field still hangs an atmosphere 
heavy with bitter confessional controversy. It 
was a time when, under cover of religion, men 
sought political or personal ends ; when churches 
were sacked, and beautiful windows broken, 
and richly sculptured shrines destroyed ; when 
a Duke of Guise was murdered by a Protestant 
fanatic, and a Parisian Catholic mob murdered 
Coligny and hundreds of Huguenots. In deal- 
ing with such a field, it is difficult to avoid some 
of the pitfalls of partisan feeling ; but Professor 
Thompson has been able to approach all its 
problems in a spirit of calm and scientific impar- 
tiality. His principal concern has obviously 
been that his statements accord exactly with the

evidence. It is probably true, however, that 
some will miss that warm sympathy for the 
Huguenot cause that pervaded Dr. Baird's 
volumes. 

The serious student of the period will be 
impressed, not merely by the author's fairness, 
but even more by his large command of the 
literature of the subject, both printed books and 
manuscript material. Indeed, there is such 
wealth of references to authorities and to docu- 
ments, such extended notes also on related facts, 
that ordinary readers may not escape the feeling 
of being burdened with erudition. The com- 
plexity of the subject tempts to such incidental 
discussion, which scholars will welcome ; for 
thereby they are put in confidential relations 
with the author, admitted as it were to his study, 
where they may follow his thought into all the 
intricacies of the evidence. To give a lucid in- 
terpretation of the struggle, Professor Thompson 
has been obliged to hold firmly many distinct 
threads in the web of affairs. It is not enough 
to consider the churchmen and the heretics, for 
ancient political forces were still at work, their 
effect in turn modified by individual and family 
interests, and the whole further confused by the 
manoeuvres of foreign princes like Philip II., 
the self-appointed agent of Providence in restor- 
ing the shaken ecclesiastical edifice to its ancient 
foundations, and Elizabeth, who found in the 
troubles of her neighbors an interval of quiet 
for her realm. Closely involved also in the 
struggle was the fate of the Netherlanders. One 
will wish that in spite of his anxiety to keep 
strictly to the evidence Professor Thompson had 
given more fully his estimates of men like 
Coligny, who are constantly on the stage. He 
mentions him many times, but not in such a way 
that the reader can obtain readily the author's 
estimate of his character and significance. Of 
Catherine and of Charles IX. there are clearer 
portraits. 

On three phases of the situation during the 
period of the Religious Wars, this work is 
unusually illuminating : the character of the 
German troops called in by both sides, the ori- 
gin of the provincial leagues, and the influence 
of economic conditions on the course of the 
struggle. The presence of the German Reiters, 
who were moved to take part on one side or the 
other by something more weighty than their 
own religious convictions, accounts in a measure 
for the atrocious character of the campaigning. 
The populations seem to have suffered much as 
they did during the last period of the Hundred 
Years' War. A more important matter is the 



provincial leagues, which gain their interest 
from the fact that they were the first hesitant 
steps toward the great league which in the period 
after 1576 was stronger than the Crown. Pro- 
fessor Thompson shows how some grew out of 
the local guilds, which had class as well as 
religious motives for opposing the Huguenot 
movement. This suggests the interplay of eco- 
nomic forces and religious tendencies, to which 
he thinks the attention given hitherto has been 
insufficient. 

The economic situation, he explains, was 
affected not merely by the ordinary vicissitudes 
of agricultural fortune, hard winters, crop fail- 
ures and famine, but also by the industrial 
revolution which had been going forward for a 
century. He believes that this revolution, which 
had been transforming the trade guilds into 
oligarchies of masters, was so influential in "its 
social and economic effects upon the Reforma- 
tion that in a very true sense the religious 
movement may be said to have been the subor- 
dinate one." Again, he says that "hosts of 
dissatisfied workmen throughout Germany and 
France began to identify themselves with Pro- 
testantism, not for religious reasons, but because 
the Reformation constituted exactly that for 
which they were seeking, a protest." He esti- 
mates that before 1560 the bulk of the Hugue 
not party was made up of artisans. For this 
his evidence is mainly the records of the heresy 
trials during the reign of Henry II. But upon 
this matter it is worth noting, as M. Lemonnier 
does in a work to which Professor Thompson 
refers, that although most of the persons brought 
to trial belonged to the lesser bourgeoisie, or 
were simple artisans, it would be unsafe to 
accept this as proof that the Protestant party 
contained few of the nobility or upper middle 
class, because in the sixteenth century the 
nobles still retained privileges which protected 
them in a measure against arrest. Further, 
even if the bulk of the party was made up of 
artisans, this would not serve as conclusive 
proof that the religious movement was with 
them mainly the means of offering a protest 
against social and industrial injustice. It has 
always been true that " to the poor the gospel 
is preached." They were predisposed by expe- 
rience to listen to a gospel which discovered 
that the traditional classification of men into 
barons and peasants, masters and journeymen, 
was of slight import compared with the simple 
Calvinistic division into those whom God had 
chosen and those whom he had not chosen. 
This was a new standard of values, based after

all upon individual moral worth ; and it was a 
potent revolutionary force. 

Unlike most historians of the period, Professor 
Thompson does not give a detailed account of 
the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew. He is 
inclined to hold Elizabeth partly responsible for 
its occurrence, because by her rejection of the 
treaty negotiated in the spring of 1572, she left 
the French to confront Philip alone ; and this 
Charles IX. was afraid to do, so that he drew 
back from his engagements with Louis of 
Nassau. Had Charles persisted, Catherine 
would have had no motive to procure the assassi- 
nation of Coligny. It hardly needs saying that 
Professor Thompson does not consider the mas- 
sacre the result of a plot put together at Bayonne 
years before. He remarks that not what 
Catherine did there, but what the Huguenots 
feared she had done, had much to do with the 
later troubles. 

The volume is enriched with many instructive 
maps and equally interesting prints. There are 
also appendices containing illustrative documents 
drawn from the Vatican archives, the National 
archives at Paris, and from the English State 
Papers. Henry E. Bourne. 



Briefs on Xew Books. 



In the aftermath of the many Lincoln 

5SKSi«. c ? lebpatio,u, . there a pp ears a ^ e of 

his early rival and later friend, 
Stephen A. Douglas, written, largely from personal 
recollections, by Col. Clark E. Carr, long a resident 
of Illinois. The surviving contemporaries and 
familiars of the famous Illinois senator are now few 
in number. It is fitting that his life should be 
written by one of these, and, in order to ensure 
balanced judgment, by one who ''was and still is a 
Republican in politics, identified with the party that 
was directly in antagonism to Senator Douglas and 
his later policies," and one who is M satisfied that 
scant justice has been done to the Senator — that 
his nobility and purity of character, and sublime 
patriotism, and transcendent abilities have not been 
appreciated as they deserve to be." Colonel Carr's 
recollections begin about 1854, during one of the 
many political canvasses which Douglas made in 
Illinois, and extend to the Lincoln-Douglas debates 
four years later, ending with the inauguration day 
of Abraham Lincoln. Especially valuable are the 
impressions made by the personality of the " Little 
Giant " on the young Carr — the versatility which 
usually carried Douglas out of any situation, the 
faultless dress, the direct " you " method of public 
address, the apparent lack of humor, and the good- 
fellowship in a company. " He smoked incessantly. 



Even when on the platform during the great de- 
bates, he smoked while Mr. Lincoln was speaking." 
In his historical composition, the author makes use 
of the lights and shadows of personal contrasts. 
Even in the Foreword he shows an appreciation of 
the value Douglas and Lincoln were to each other. 
" Great as is the fame of Abraham Lincoln, it may 
be doubted whether his name would have been 
known to any considerable degree beyond the limits 
of the state of Illinois but for his proving himself 
able to cope with the Senator [Douglas] in what are 
known as the Lincoln- Douglas debates." Espe- 
cially the author loves to dwell on the friendship 
which was renewed in the critical hour when the 
existence of the Union was in periL The little 
volume (McClurg & Co.), while far from being a 
thorough life of Douglas or a comprehensive esti- 
mate of his services, is a valuable and interesting 
contribution and will aid in placing in a truer light 
the man whose unfortunate lot it was to act as a 
foil for Lincoln and to be on the losing side in the 
final casting of the dice of chance.

Xew England. Mr. Jonathan Thayer Lincoln, a Fall 
River manufacturer who has written a book called 
•'The City of the Dinner Pail" (Houghton), in 
which he presents a pleasing picture of the cotton- 
mill workers who constitute a quarter of the popu- 
lation of his city, and discusses, with seventeen 
years of factory experience to draw upon, the actual 
and the desirable relations of the employed to their 
employers. He finds, in his own city at least, "the 
law of progress operating in a class of working- 
people seeking its end through culture." In all that 
makes for the higher life, he asserts, this cotton- 
manufacturing city of many races and many lan- 
guages has made greater advance than in material 
things. Only nine years after Boston established 
the first free public library, the City of the Dinner 
Pail founded a similar institution ; and other indi- 
cations of enlightenment are not wanting. The 
solution of the labor problem, the author believes, 
is to be found, not in legislation, but " in a fuller 
understanding of the lives of those we meet and talk 
with and pass by each day." Increased knowledge 
and sympathy and mutual good-will would, as all 
must admit, greatly hasten the coming of the 
millennium. Trade-unions the author regards as 
capable of benefit to both laborer and capitalist ; but 
he recognizes the abuses of unionism as it now 
exists. In noting with regret the narrowing influ- 
ence of specialism, whether in the manual arts or in 
the learned professions, he makes passing reference 
to " doctors of medicine whose knowledge of anat- 
omy is confined to a single organ, lawyers who are 
unable to address a jury, and clergymen who cannot 
preach sermons." A tongue-tied clergyman, in a 
world where all are but too prone to preach, would 
be a spectacle indeed. The book is small and unpre 
tentious, and deals with local rather than widely

prevalent conditions ; but its agreeable style, its

make it a welcome contribution to the literature of 
the labor question and of social problems in city life. 

a v •.„. ■ ,„ The scope of Professor Mttnster- 

An inquiry into . *r 

the values of our berg's interests and the versatility of 
philosophic life, j^g contributions is eminently demon- 
strated in his ability to publish within a year a vol- 
ume applying psychological results to legal evidence, 
a book of appeal to teachers from the psychological 
pulpit, and a comprehensive inquiry into the eternal 
values of our philosophical life. Originally written 
in German, the latter book appeared in its English 
form some months ago ( u The Eternal Values " — 
Houghton), and will interest the same set of readers 
who in this country are accustomed to follow the 
author's more philosophical contributions. For their 
benefit it may be said that the book implies a will- 
ingness on their part to consider minutely and 
thoroughly the ground-work of the logic of experience 
as it is interpreted and made significant by the impos- 
ing system of human values. It is a discussion of 
fundamental points of view, a discussion that deter- 
mines how we shall think of science, of philosophy, 
of duty, of destiny. Its central distinction is that 
of the causal logically-elaborated universe, and of 
the ethical duty-directed world in which our human 
civilized interests prevail. It is thus a volume 
neither lightly to be taken up nor inconsiderately 
to be laid down. Its reading involves both leisure 
and the contemplative habit, and on the other hand 
a faith that Professor Mttnsterberg's guidance 
through many long pages and devious paths is 
acceptable. For the work cannot be said to be 
original in any other sense than that it gives a 
personally-conducted tour through the mazes of 
philosophical attitudes, in which pursuit the person- 
ality of the conductor forms a notable factor in the 
pleasure and profit of the enterprise. 

Utilizing the association which mod- 
'th F eTeicn7r V » and ern education recognizes between 

psychology and the teacher, Professor 
Miinsterberg arranges in systematic form his ideas 
of what teachers should know and feel. It is largely 
advice, partly sermonizing, together with some sound 
exposition of wholesome texts ; and the whole, if 
well shaken and frequently taken, should prove an 
efficient corrective for much weak sentiment and 
weaker thinking that passes for wisdom at educa- 
tional meetings. The earlier pronouncements of the 
Harvard psychologist on the relation of psychology 
to education — the relation being set forth as a 
nonentity or a menace — were over-seasoned ; and 
the present prefatorial attempt to explain them is as 
unsuccessful as it is unnecessary. Professor Mttn- 
sterberg's text speaks for itself. That no superficial 
manipulation of psychological data can supply ethical 
motives, or set a goal to our endeavors, is as true and 
as pertinent to this day and generation as to their 
predecessors, The swamping of all educational 



ideals by utilitarian and commercial concerns remains 
the " yellow peril "; and nothing but a widely dis- 
seminated and enthusiastic sense of the categorical 
imperative among morally vertebrate personalities 
will keep it down. When we are told, or read, as 
teachers are told, that he who throws his influence 
in behalf of thoroughness rather than the immedi- 
ately attractive, who makes children willing as well 
as able to realize ideals, who presents ideals not as 
the refuge of flabby souls but as the dominant 
source of wholesome action, who makes the school a 
place where beauty, harmony, and character may be 
treated as realities and established as motives, before 
their pursuit is hopelessly swamped in the street and 
the market-place, is filling his place as a teacher, it 
all sounds trite, and we know we have heard it 
before. But there is really little else to say. The 
situation is one that calls for doing, not talking ; and 
it is only because there is such confusion of tongues 
that some plain speaking is- still to be welcomed. 
Professor Mtinsterberg says more than this : he pre- 
sents some pertinent illustrations of how psycho- 
logical insight lets in light upon actual problems ; 
and he clears away some venerable cobwebs, as well 
as the entangling constructions of more modern 
spiders, in the musty educational cellar. He is really 
trying to put the foundations in order ; though the 
conception of his task leads him to a personally- 
conducted and critical tour from cellar to attic, or 
from kindergarten to the university. The Teutonic 
thoroughness of the survey militates somewhat 
against the actual attractiveness of the expedition. 
Our teachers are not quite used to being thus 
addressed ; and there is a danger, as is common with 
sermons, that those most in need of the uplift are 
not to be found in the congregation. (D. Appleton 
& Co.) . 

Practical aids In Great Britain th . ere are n0 libraI T 
to the study of schools, but examinations are held 
iibrarianship. un( J e r the auspices of the Library 
Association, and there are classes at the London 
School of Economics and other centres, besides cor- 
respondence classes conducted by the Association 
itself. Some years ago Mr. James Duff Brown pub- 
lished an " Annotated Syllabus for the Systematic 
Study of Librarianship," as a guide to assistants 
and others who wished to prepare for the examina- 
tions. The " Guide to Librarianship " which the 
same writer has recently published is much more 
than a new edition of the Syllabus, though prepared 
with the earlier publication as a basis. What Mr. 
Brown now offers is in fact an index to the most 
important library literature of the last thirty years, 
grouped under the headings of : Literary History, 
Bibliography, Classification, Cataloguing, Library 
History and Equipment, Library Routine. Each 
group is preceded by a statement of the require- 
ments at the examinations, and hints as to methods 
of study, short, practical, and to the point. The 
book is indeed one of those that really ought to be 
"on every librarian's desk," and others than libra-

rians will find it profitable to consult it. The library 
is becoming more and more a centre of the intel- 
lectual life of a community, and knowledge of what 
it means and what it stands for should really be part 
of every cultivated person's mental equipment. 
" Book Selection," by Mr. J. D. Stewart and Miss 
Olive E. Clarke, both members of Mr. Brown's staff, 
is an annotated list of bibliographies, catalogues, and 
other things that might be helpful in the selection of 
books. Mr. Stewart's " Sheaf Catalogue " is of a 
more purely technical interest, being a description of 
a form of manuscript catalogue which is perhaps best 
known in this country by the name of the Ley den 
catalogue. The book contains a guide to cataloguers' 
reference books. These works are issued in London 
by the firm of Libraco, Limited. 

Pen-sketches Those to whom history is not merely 
of Speakers past politics, but past gossip, past 
of the House. anecdote, and past scandal, will enjoy 
a recent book by Mr. Hubert Bruce Fuller, entitled 
" The Speakers of the House " ( Little, Brown, & 
Co. ). The preface announces the author's endeavor 
to avoid the dry and technical mysteries of parlia- 
mentary law and to popularize the work by the 
inclusion of anecdotes and reminiscences and the 
omission of all annotations and references. In this 
he has been eminently successful. His sense of 
values may be judged by this quotation : " On one 
occasion Kilgore of Texas kicked open a door and 
effected his escape from the chamber. This was 
the most notable parliamentary scene ever enacted 
upon the American legislative stage." The book 
revels in somewhat lurid characterization. Clay is 
called a perihelion of compromise ; his life, a pulsa- 
ting lesson on the blessing of penury — an epic of 
democracy. Colfax is said to have had a gelatinous 
political existence ; Blaine, a facile lack of scruple. 
In one paragraph Mr. Cannon appears as a man 
" remarkably abstemious in his habits and desires "; 
in another, while at banquets he " drinks champagne 
from his water-glass, tilts his chair back against 
the wall, and smokes the finest cigars in the style 
popular at the cross-roads store." 



Government of Novel experiments in municipal gov- 
the Australian ernment greet us with bewildering 
Commonwealth. rap idity. But seldom are we per- 
mitted to observe the operation of an entirely mod- 
ern system of government for ordering the affairs 
of a continent. Of especial interest, therefore, is Mr. 
B. R. Wise's work on "The Commonwealth of 
Australia " (Little, Brown, & Co.). After outlining 
the economic, social, and political conditions which 
preceded the inauguration of the federal system ten 
years ago, the author treats of the framework of 
the Commonwealth government (as the central 
organs are termed), its relations to the component 
states of the commonwealth, and the political his- 
tory of its first decade. The reader will share the 
author's regret that the book is but an outline 
sketch. We should welcome, for example, a more 



extended discussion of the success of the experiment 
of combining the parliamentary system of Great 
Britain with the Federal system of the United 
States. It was predicted at the outset that there 
could not be a responsible government which was 
responsible to two houses of parliament. Mr. Wise 
shows that the anticipated conflict has not yet come 
to a direct issue, because thus far the senate has 
been divided on the same party lines as the house. 
But he sees in this the failure of the senate to per- 
form its original function as a States house, and 
concludes that the tendency is therefore toward the 
supremacy of the lower house and the consequent 
strengthening of the system of responsible govern- 
ment at the expense of the idea of federation. But 
the facts on which his inference is based are not set 
forth in sufficient detail to enable one to test the 
accuracy of his judgment. There is still room for 
a more compendious and detailed treatment of the 
constitutional questions of the new commonwealth. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A handy bibliography of polar literature has appeared, 
with the title " The Polar Regions," from the ever alert 
and progressive Brooklyn Public Library. In a pam- 
phlet uniform with its other bibliographical lists, three 
hundred and twenty-seven titles are brought together. 
Captain Peary is represented by seven contributions to 
Arctic literature, Mrs. Peary by three, and Dr. Cook 
by his Antarctic narrative, " Through the First Ant- 
arctic Night." The subject of polar voyages is mani- 
festly not exhausted by this list of material in the 
Brooklyn library, but it may well serve the general 
reader for a beginning, and something more. 

A worthy descendant of the great historian and 
statesman, M. Francois de Nitt-Guizot, has recently 
published some notes on education, which deserve to 
attract attention for their literary form and their saga- 
cious interpretations of the problems of education in 
France. Under the title " Les Reflexions de Monsieur 
Honletti " we are introduced to an old schoolmaster 
who recounts his part in the education of a boy up to the 
beginning of manhood. The pictures of the Huguenot, 
the Catholic and the modern boy, are in themselves 
fine ; but they are treated as types of the forces which 
are at work building the new age, and the incidents in 
the lad's career are occasions for display of a wealth 
of learning and personal reflection in the field of 
modern pedagogy. 

Boswell's " Life of Samuel Johnson " is a book for 
intimate companionship, and our first thought respect- 
ing the new edition published in this bicentenary year 
by the Sturgis & Walton Co. is one of regret at the 
bulkiness of the two volumes. They are distinctly 
tomes for the table, and not for the lap or the pocket. 
But resentment speedily becomes mollified when we 
examine the volumes and rejoice in the wealth of their 
illustration. The illustrations, which number over three 
hundred and include six plates in photogravure, are 
the distinctive feature of this edition, and constitute 
the reason why it has to be so bulky. They have been 
collected from many out-of-the-way sources, by Mr. 
Roger Ingpen, the editor, who has also accomplished a 
useful work of scholarship in his annotation of the text.

Notes. 



" Boy Life " is a book of selections from the writings 
of Mr. W. D. Howells, prepared by Mr. Percival Chubb 
for use as a supplementary reader, and published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

The diverting and informing introductions contrib- 
uted by Mr. G. K. Chesterton to the " Everyman's 
Library " edition of Dickens are to be gathered into a 
separate volume and published before long by Messrs. 
Dutton & Co. 

Miss Mary Sinclair's new novel is to be published 
serially, the first instalment appearing this month in 
"The Century Magazine." This latest work by the 
author of " The Divine Fire " is a story of artists and 
writers in London, and is called " The Creators : A 
Comedy." 

The library of the late Simon Newcomb, the astron- 
omer, has been presented to the College of the City of 
New York by John Claflin, who purchased it from the 
Newcomb estate. It consists of 6000 volumes and 
3000 pamphlets on scientific subjects, some of them 
very rare. 

Miss Laura Stedman, of New York City, has con- 
cluded a contract for the publication of the official 
" Life and Letters of E. C. Stedman," which she now 
has in active preparation. Miss Stedman is the poet's 
granddaughter. Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. will be 
the publishers. 

A timely book on big game shooting is announced for 
publication this month by the J. B. Lippincott Co. It 
will be called " Hunting in British East Africa," and is 
the record of a highly successful hunt made by Percy C. 
Madeira over much the same ground that Mr. Roose- 
velt is now covering. 

It is reported that Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Pennell, 
authors of the very successful life of Whistler published 
last year, are coming to the United States in January 
next and will make a joint lecture tour. It is under- 
stood that they will talk of " Whistler the Artist and the 
Man," " The History of Illustration," and " Engraving." 

Under the title of " The History of Science," a series 
of books, each one devoted to the history of one of the 
leading branches of science, is announced by the Messrs. 
Putnam. The first two volumes of the series will be a 
History of Astronomy and a History of Chemistry, 
written respectively by George Forbes and by Sir 
Edward Thorpe. 

" In Starland with a Three-Inch Telescope," by Mr. 
William Tyler Olcott, is a little book that will prove 
very convenient to the amateur astronomer, even if 
equipped with nothing better than a good opera-glass. 
There are many diagrams, including a series of the 
moon at various ages. The book is pubhshed by the 
Messrs. Putnam. 

The publication of that much-needed work, a Scots 
Dialect Dictionary, is announced from London. It has 
been prepared by the Rev. Alexander Warrack, for- 
merly of Leswalt. The work is to be dedicated to Dr. 
Craigie, of the English Dictionary, and has an intro- 
duction by Mr. Grant, Lecturer on Phonetics in the 
Aberdeen Training College. 

Mr. Chalmers Hadley, formerly Secretary and State 
Organizer of the Public Library Commission of Indiana, 
has been chosen to take charge of the new Chicago 
headquarters of the American Library Association, on 
the fifth floor of the Public Library Building, where all 



visiting library workers will find much to interest them. 
It is announced that the new offices are open daily from 
nine to five, and members visiting Chicago may have 
mail sent there and are cordially invited to use the 
rooms. 

The Putnams will shortly publish " Abraham Lincoln 
— the People's Leader in the Struggle for National 
Existence," by Mr. George Haven Putnam. Mr. Put- 
nam has utilized an address given on the Centennial 
Commemoration Day, February 12, 1909, as the germ 
for this monograph, which presents the main events in 
the career of the people's leader. 

That Ben Jonson was the author of an English 
grammar is a fact that may come as a surprise even to 
students of English literature. That the work is " an 
interesting milestone in the history of the English 
language " is a fact that has so impressed itself upon 
Miss Alice Vinton Waite that she has edited it for the 
use of teachers. The work, based upon the text of 
1640, is published by the Sturgis & Walton Co. 

The first Grammar of the language spoken by the 
Bontoc Igorot (a mountain tribe of North Luzon, 
Philippine Islands), by Dr. Carl Wilhelm Seidenadel, 
is announced by the Open Court Publishing Co. This 
Grammar, the first of the hitherto unexplored idiom of 
the Bontoc Igorot, contains the results of a scholar's 
independent and uninfluenced research ; it is based 
entirely upon material collected directly from the 
natives' lips. An extensive Vocabulary of more than 
four thousand Igorot words, and Texts on Mythology, 
Folk Lore, Historical Episodes and Songs, are included 
in this book, which furnishes an abundance of trust- 
worthy material and new theories about the structure 
of Philippine languages in general. 

An announcement of unusual interest to American 
bibliophiles is that the next publication of The Doves 
Press, to appear this month, will be a reprint of the 
paper on William Caxton read by George Parker Win- 
ship, Librarian of the John Carter Brown Library of 
Providence, before the Club of Odd Volumes, in Feb- 
ruary of last year. The edition will be Umited to 300 
paper copies, and 15 copies on vellum. Mr. Cobden- 
Sanderson has also in press, for issue this month, a 
tercentenary edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, printed 
verbatim et literatim from the original edition "im- 
printed at London by G. Eld for T. T. 1609," on the 
same plan as the reprint of " Hamlet " reviewed in the 
last issue of The Dial. A new volume (the second) 
in the Doves Press edition of Goethe's " Faust " will 
appear in the Spring of next year ; the first part, it 
will be recalled, was published in 1906. 

" Representative Biographies of English men of 
Letters," edited by Messrs. Charles T. Copeland and 
Frank W. C. Hersey, is published by the Macmillan 
Co. Carlyle's essay on " Biography " serves as an intro- 
duction, and is followed by three classes of examples. 
In the first class, we have extracts from such famous 
autobiographies as those of Lord Herbert of Cherbury 
and Gibbon, and autobiographical passages from the 
writings of Pepys, Swift, Cibber, Carlyle, Dickens, 
Ruskin, and Stevenson. In the second group we have 
examples of the work of famous biographers, complete 
lives in some cases, extracts in others. The authors 
here illustrated are Walton, Johnson, Boswell, Southey, 
Lockhart, Macaulay, Carlyle, and Thackeray. The 
third group offers reprints of a dozen lives from the 
"Dictionary of National Biography," illustrating the

methods of such writers as Messrs. Sidney Lee, Austin 
Dobson, Edmund Gosse, Sidney Colvin, Richard Gar- 
nett, and Leslie Stephen. This makes a useful collection 
of material for the student of biographical technique, 
but the selection is too haphazard to be of much use to 
the student of the history of English literature. 

Col. Theodore A. Dodge, the well-known military 
historian, critic, and writer, died in Versailles, France, 
on the 26th of October, at the age of sixty-seven. 
Colonel Dodge was one of the brilliant young Massa- 
chusetts officers who achieved distinction in the Civil 
War, enlisting as a private in 1861 and being in com- 
mand of a regiment before he was twenty-one. At 
Gettysburg he lost a leg, and on other fields sustained 
severe wounds. After the war, Colonel Dodge's edu- 
cation and experience led him to take up the study of 
military subjects, in which he attained high rank as a 
student and author. His " Birds-eye View of the Civil 
War " and " The Chmpaign of Chancellorsville " are 
perhaps the best known of his works, which range from 
lighter essays and magazine articles to a " History of 
the Art of War " in twelve volumes. Colonel Dodge's 
memory is especially cherished by The Dial, to which 
he was a frequent and always welcome contributor 
during its earlier years. 

The publication by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
of the Memorial Edition of the Works of* George 
Meredith will begin in this country during this Fall, 
probably in November, and simultaneously with the 
publication in England. The set will include from 
twenty-five to twenty-seven volumes; it will be printed 
from new type on fine paper, and will be handsomely 
bound. The illustrations will comprise reproductions 
of many of the original illustrations which accompanied 
the author's novels and poems when published in mag- 
azine form, a number of portraits taken at different 
periods of Meredith's life, pictures especially taken for 
this edition from scenes associated by the author with 
many of his novels and poems, reproductions of MSS., 
etc. The edition will include the hitherto unpublished 
novel, " Celt and Saxon," and an unfinished comedy, 
"The Sentimentalists"; while in the volumes of short 
stories and essays will be included some incomplete 
MSS. and several critical reviews and articles. The 
poems will include all the poetry published by the au- 
thor over his name, or with regard to the publication of 
which he left instructions. There will also be a volume 
containing the various changes, etc., made by Meredith 
in his work, together with a complete bibliography.

TAMAM 



By CHARLES CHILTON MOORE 

Neale Publishing Company, New York. $1.60. 

"A very big thought in a very unusual and sometimes classic 
book." — Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in the New York Journal. 

"Quite unlike other books, and not amenable to classifica- 
tion, ' Tamam ' presents a series of studies of the inner life and 
of psychological experience intertwined with pictures of the 
outer side of life, varied with pleasing descriptions of natural 
scenes, and all bound together with a thread of intense emotion 
afforded by the love of a strong, deep-natured man and a 
woman of equal strength of 'feeling. The author does not even 
give these two people names, and they pass in and out of the 
scenes almost as weirdly as if they were ghosts deeply colored 
with human passions. The book has a certain quiet strength 
combined with refinement of feeling, and is very well written. 
The title is a Persian word, meaning oblivion." — The New 
York Times, Jan. 30. 

"Some of the musings on life and death and sorrow and 
mystery are beautifully expressed, full of melancholy and 
pathos." — Louisville Courier-Journal. 

" The book is evidently written by a poet and a dreamer, and 
will be best appreciated by such." — Philadelphia Book News.

[Nov. 1, 1909. 



NOTES ON A FEW OF HENRY HOLT & COMPANY'S NEW AND REGENT BOOKS 



Wm. De Morgan's It Never Can Happen 
Again will appear November 16. ($1.75.) 

Letters from G. Q. excited wide and enthusi- 
astic approval as they appeared this year in the 
American Magazine. They are from a refined, dis- 
cerning young woman, forced to earn her living by 
brush and pen, and have the savor of personality. 
(223 pp., 16mo. $1.00 net; by mail, $1.06.) 

William R. Hereford's The Demagog is a 

stirring political novel of an unusual and breathlessly 
interesting sort. The main figure, the owner of a 
chain of great daily papers, seeks the Presidency. 
($1.50.) 

Wilson Vance's Big John Baldwin, the 

romance of a big-hearted, big-bodied Cromwellian 
soldier in England and Virginia. The Hartford 
Courant says : " The love story is charming, with its 
intimate analysis of the big fellow's emotions and 
honest awkwardness, never folly. His wit is clumsy 
. . . but it is wit, and, slowly perhaps, it gets there." 
The Detroit Free Press says it 's " a book to read 
leisurely, as one sips and enjoys good wine." ($1.50.) 

Mrs. R. S. Garnett's The Infamous John 
Friend is receiving remarkable notices. The 
Bookman says : "It has many fine qualities . . . 
vivid and full of the stir of life." The New York 
Sun: " Exceedingly vivid and interesting." It tells 
a dramatic episode of Napoleon's projected invasion 
of England. ($1.50.) 

Notable New Books for Young Folks 

Alice C. Haines's Cock-a=doo=dle Hill, a 

sequel to u The Luck of the Dudley Grahams." A 
poultry farming story of home life that will appeal 
particularly to girls. (Illustrated. $1.50.) 

Louise Godfrey Irwin's The Secret of Old 
Thunderhead tells the stirring experiences of 
some city young folks who visit their country cousins 
on a Vermont farm. (Illustrated. $1.50.) 

H. G. Hunting's The Cave of the Bottom- 
less Pool is the equally stirring sequel to his 
Witter Whitehead's Own Story which the 
Chicago Tribune finds " undeniably brisk and fas- 
cinating." The new story is full of adventure, and 
passes in a summer school camp. ($1.50.) 

Charles P. Burton certainly has the heart of a 
boy, and in The Bob's Cave Boys ($1.50), a 
sequel to his Boys of Bob's Hill, has drawn 

youngsters who are " all hot sand and ginger." The 
new book, illustrated by Perard, is just issued, but 
bids fair to equal the popularity of its predecessor, 
which is already in its sixth printing. 



Prof. R. M. Johnston's The French Revolu= 
tion: A Short History, is called by the Church- 
man "an almost ideal book of its kind and within 
its scope." ($1.25 net; by mail, SI. 37.) 

... By the same author : Napoleon : A Short 
Biography. ($1.25 net.) Leading American 
Soldiers. ($1.75 net ; by mail, $1.92.) 

Jane Grey Perkins's Life of the Honorable 
Mrs. Norton, with hitherto unpublished letters. 
(Illustrated. Probable price, $3.50 net. 

Mrs. Norton was one of the " three graces " of 
English society in the first half of the last century. 
She was the great Sheridan's granddaughter ; the 
author of several novels and many poems and songs, 
contesting contemporary popularity with Mrs. 
Browning ; a friend of Lord Melbourne, Fanny 
Kemble, Motley, etc.; her influence was potent in 
politics ; Meredith undoubtedly had her in mind 
when he drew " Diana." This biography is able, 
interesting, and sincere. 

John Davis's Travels of Four Years and a 
Half in the United States of America (1798- 
1802) . The Nation says of this book : "A really 
noteworthy narrative account of our young Amer- 
ica." With introduction and notes by Alfred J. 
Morrison. ($2.50 net ; by mail, $2.65.) Circular 
on request. 

Dr. Richard Burton's Masters of the 
English Novel. This new book by the author 
of " Literary Likings " covers Fiction and the Novel : 
Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, and Others. 
Realism : Jane Austen. Modern Romanticism : 
Scott. French Influence : Dickens, Thackeray, 
George Eliot, Trollope, and Others, Hardy ard 
Meredith, Stevenson. The American Contribution, 
etc. ($1.25 net.) 

Charles Frederick Carter's When the Rail= 
roads Were New. The New York Tribune says : 
" With many of the qualities of a work of refer- 
ence, the book is as readable as a novel." (16 full- 
page illustrations. ($2.00 net; by mail, $2.16.) 

Logan G. McPherson's Railroad Freight 
Rates in Relation to the Industry and Com= 
merce of the United States is truly called by 
the Sun "a book the Nation has needed." (Third 
printing. $2.25 net; by mail, $2.42.) 



The book for the Opera Season is Krehbiel's 
Chapters of Opera. (Richly illustrated. $3.50 
net ; by mail, $3.72. ) Illustrated circular on appli- 
cation.

American Prose Masters 

By W. C. Bkownell. J9 net ; postpaid, $1.65. 

The most noteworthy of recent contribntions to the literature of criticism in this coun- 
try. In this new book Mr. Brownell writes of Cooper, Hawthorne, Emerson, Lowell, 
Henry James and Poe with the same breadth of sympathy, discriminating insight and 
distinction of style that distinguished his " Victorian Prose Masters," " French Traits," 
and "' French Art." 

Success in Music and How It is Won 

By Henky T. Fin- k. «» net ; postpaid, 32.20. 

An intensely interesting account of the reasons for the success of the great singers, 
violinists, pianists, and teachers, with much practical advice about all phases of a musi- 
cal career to-day and a chapter of entrancing interest by Ignace Jan Paderewski on 
"tempo rubato." 

Landscape Painting 

By Bir<;e H\rrison. 26 full-page illustrations. $1.50 net ; postpaid, 8 1.63. 

Stimulating, clear, and suggestive talks on painting from the point of view of the artist, 
but so simply and vividly expressed that they are as interesting and valuable to the 
layman -who cares for pictures as to the artist. He takes up values, color, vibration,

This is what The Nation has to say about 

HAPPY HAWKINS 

By ROBERT ALEXANDER WASON 

" One opens ' Happy Hawkins ' expecting the usual ranch 
and cowboy novel. Abundant, in truth, are ranch and cowboy, 
guns, gambling dens — but they all stand for something better 
and larger than « effects.' Happy Hawkins tells his own story 
in undiluted Western language. His story is so good and he 
tells it with such a fine capacity for knowing how to do it that 
every page does, indeed, hold the interest in a grip that is at 
first surprise, then admiration, and at last positive affection. 
The most dialect-weary reader must own that here the dialect 
in an indispensable charm ; and those who stop the ears when 
American humor is mentioned need have no fear — for here is 
the thing in its best estate. Melodrama there is, but far more 
of daily human nature. In an occasional flaming color there 
is revealed less of the theatrical than of the eternal boyish. 
The question is: has any nove l of the West as good as this 
been written since 'The Virginian ' ? " 

This story of the big-hearted, lovable, whimsical Westerner has 
made its author's reputation. It is a great book which every Ameri- 
can should read. 16 pictures by Howard Giles. $1.50.

OTHER BRILLIANT NOVELS FOR EVERY READER 



TRESPASS 

By MRS. HENRY DUDENEY 

Author of "Folly Corner," "Rachel 
Lorian," etc. 
$1.25 net; postage 12 cents 
This much - reviewed and widely dis- 
cussed book is a strong and impressive 
novel of English life for those who dis- 
criminate. 

It is a story of two men and one woman — 
" the eternal triangle." Note what the critics 
are saying : 

" It is masterly, a really profound study 
of motive and character. Like ' Tess of 
the D'Urbervilles,' it deals boldly with the 
problems of passion, and may offend in 
this way, but, like that book also, it is essen- 
tially dramatic, a searching exposition of 
human nature under the stress of conflict- 
ing emotions." — The Outlook. 

" Mrs. Humphry Ward at her best does 
not surpass this work." 

— Book News Monthly. 

" Mrs. Dudeney's books have all shown 
remarkable strength, literary feeling and 
capacity in the depiction of character. In 
this book she springs lightly, on tip-toe, 
with a winged step. It is a pleasure to 
read the pages of this novel, just for the 
sake of the color, the sparkle, the suggest- 
iveness of the sentences." 

— New York Times. 



The Shadow Between 
His Shoulder Blades 

By JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS 

Illustrated by George Harding. 
50 cents net; postage 6 cents 



"A graphic and picturesque Civil 
War tale." — Chicago News. 

"It's a dear little story, human, 
lovable, prismatic, sweet with tears, 
and quiet laughter. A typical Joel 
Chandler Harris story." 

— Chicago Record-Herald. 



The literary find of the year. 
"A book so refreshingly real and 
quaint and charming," says the Chi- 
cago Journal, "that its reading is a 
delight and a surprise ; a novel of 
the Arcadian country of Louisiana. 
It is the beautiful life of simple folk 
that is the joy of the story. ' Marie 
of Arcady ' is a classic."

Old Clinkers 

A Story of the New York Fire Department 

By HARVEY J. O'HIGGINS 

Author of "The Smoke Eaters," etc. 
Illustrated by Martin Justice. 

$1.50 



A " hero-story " as well as a book 
of the greatest public interest. Cap- 
tain Keighley, of the fireboat "Hud- 
son," who is called "Old Clinkers," 
is a fine figure of a man. So long as 
brave deeds of self-sacrifice thrill 
the hearts of men, books like this 
will continue to be read. " A story 
of magnificent bravery," says the 
New York Times. 



Like "Emmy Lou " of beloved 
memory, this is not a juvenile ; it is 
"a story about children for grown- 
ups." 

" Old and young readers will be 
equally appreciative of its indubit- 
able charm. Rhoda is quite as de- 
lightful as Rebecca at her best, or 
as Anne of Green Gables."

NEW ILLUSTRATED BOOKS 




Beautiful Children 

Immortalized by the Masters 

By C. HALDANE McFALL. With sixty full- 
page illustrations in four colors, reproduced 
direct from the original paintings by the 
old masters. Edited by T. Leman Hare. 

This is the largest and most beautiful collection of 

world-famous paintings of children ever collected 

in a moderate-priced volume. 

Here is a wonderful opportunity for the lover of 
art, or the lover of children, to possess copies of the 
court children of Velasquez, the infants of Raphael, 
the little dukes and duchesses of Sir Joshua Rey- 
nolds, or Gainsborough, etc., reproduced in a man- 
ner which does justice to the matchless drawing and 
coloring of the originals. Nearly every one owns a 
photograph or two of some of these pictures. But 
no photograph can do justice to the marvelous 
coloring of the paintings themselves. Some of the 
illustrations are from paintings which have never 
before been reproduced in colors. 

Large 8vo, boxed, net $5.00. 

Masterpieces of Handicraft 

Edited by T. LEMAN HARE 

Many excellent books have been written in the 
last twenty years on various porcelains, old and 
new, but those in which the illustrations are care- 
fully colored from photographs have been pub- 
lished for the few at high prices. The present 
series is published for the many at a low price. 
They are written by experts, in non-technical lan- 
guage, and make highly valuable books for every 
woman who owns a few pieces of old China — and 
what woman does not ? The illustrations, which 
are beautiful reproductions in colors of rare pieces 
of porcelains, are a striking feature of this series. 
Each volume contains picture on cover and six illus- 
trations printed in four colors; eight illustrations 
in black and white.

Their Hearts' Desire 

By FRANCES FOSTER PERRY 

With full-page Illustrations in 
full color by Harrison Fisher. 
Beautifully decorated in col- 
ors and handsomely bound. 

As sweet and tender a little love 
story as this is rarely written. It is 
delightfully bright, touching and 
sympathetic ; the sort of story that 
makes you laugh with a catch in 
your voice, and the sort of story 
that makes friends of its readers. It 
must be read to be appreciated, for 
no description can do justice to this 
altogether charming and wholesome 
love story. It is beautifully illus- 
trated by some of the best pictures 
that Harrison Fisher has painted.

LONG'S ENGLISH LITERATURE 

Its History and Its Significance for the Life of the English-Speaking World 

By WILLIAM J. LONG 

A DIRECT, simple, and interesting account of the great English writers, their works, and the literary periods 
in which they are included. A sympathetic and scholarly atmosphere pervades the entire work. The 
information is accurate, clearly arranged, and displays a broad and penetrating knowledge of the subject. The 
illustrations, quotations, outlines, summaries, historical introductions, complete indexes, and a good working bibli- 
ography will be found of inestimable value to students. 

Long's English Literature is admirably put together, discriminating in its emphasis, sound in its judgments, and thoroughly 
helpful for high school and college work. It will be the best book in the market, and I shall use it and commend it. 

Percival Chubb, Director of English, Ethical Culture School, New York City. 
Dr. Long has made by long odds the most alive and sympathetic book on English literature we have, excepting, and here the 
scope of the authors is quite distinct, Jusserand's. 

Philo M. Buck, Jr., Teacher of English, William McKinley High School, St. Louis, Mo. 

The Introduction is a little masterpiece. The illustrations are worthy of the subject matter, and the subject matter is far 

above the run of most text-books of any sort. Long knows how to write. I like his personal criticisms : they are so unbookish and 

fresh. The book will be a winner. H. E. Coblentz, Head of English Department, South Division High School, Milwaukee, Wis. 

It seems to me the first of its kind, admirably devised and admirably carried out. I am impressed with the amount of infor- 
mation, of side-light comment, which Mr. Long has deftly worked into his clear and well-marked account. The book is, very truly, 
one which may be studied, phrase by phrase, and which may be made the basis of even an elaborate course.

LAUT CANADA. Just Published. By Agnes C. Laut.

NEW BOOKS 



THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER By james edward rooers 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been 
made. Tbe author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion being treated as one of 
concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of 
getting acquainted with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book discusses in succession the following topics: 
The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper; The City and the Newspaper; The Nature of the American Newspaper; The 
Influence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid $1.10. 

ENGLISH POEMS: The Elizabethan Age and the Puritan Period By Walter c. bronson 

So favorable has been the reception accorded " The Nineteenth Century" and " The Restoration and the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury " that the present volume needs little introduction. It follows the same general plan as its predecessors, with the added 
advantage of an especially fascinating field — the most spontaneous and exuberant period of English poetry. The notes contain 
elucidations of difficult passages and illuminating commentary — the index and bibliography are unusually elaborate and detailed.

viewed, and critical comments are appended to each part. There are seven parts: (1) External Environment (Anthropogeography 
and Primitive Economics) ; (2) Primitive Mind and Education; (3) Early Marriage; (4) Invention and Technology; (5) Art, Orna- 
ment, and Decoration ; (6) Magic, Religion, Ritual, and Ceremonial ; (7) Social Organization, Morality, and the State. The extended

BIBLICAL IDEAS OF ATONEMENT : Their History and Significance 

By ERNEST DEWITT BURTON, JOHN MERLIN POW1S SMITH, and GERALD BIRNEY SMITH 

This book sets forth the content of the biblical teachings upon the subject of Atonement, and suggests the point of view from 
which these conceptions may profitably be studied at the present day. The attitude assumed toward the records throughout is 
that of historical interpretation rather than of theological systematization. Consequently, the effort is to discover precisely what 
ideas of atonement are reflected by the biblical laws, institutions, and utterances. The authors employ the historical method 
throughout. To trace the history of an idea is to discover the forces that have co-operated to produce it and to transform it from 
age to age. The history of the idea is thus its best explanation. Yet as many readers will desire, not only a historical statement 
of what was believed and taught by the prophets and teachers of old, but also some indication of the value of those teachings for 
the present day, the closing section of the book (Chap, xii, xiii) is devoted to this aspect of the matter. 338 pages, 12mo, cloth;

"~\^7"HILE the author was and still is a Republican in politics, identified with the party that was in 
VV direct antagonism with Senator Douglas and his later policies, he became satisfied that but scant 
justice had been done to the Senator — that his nobility and purity of character, sublime patriotism, and 
transcendent abilities have not been appreciated as they deserve to be. 

" Those who remember the potentiality of Senator Douglas, and who have a proper conception of his 
character and statesmanship, are rapidly passing away: Because of this the publishers wished to have one 
whose memory went back to those ante-bellum times, and who knew both Lincoln and Douglas, to give 
some of his recollections of the stirring events in which they acted, and so the author has consented to carry 
into execution the work he has long contemplated."

Psychology and the Teacher 

By HUGO MUNSTERBURG, Ph.D., M.D., LL.D., Litt.D., 

Professor of Psychology at Harvard University 

In Professor Miinsterberg's own words — "The teacher must 
understand the material with which he works, must know the mind 
and body of the pupil and the social conditions under which he 
lives, must go through child-study and the study of adolescence ; 
in short, must study as thoroughly as possible the mental and 
physical facts, their working and their laws." 

This book gives the teacher a practical and helpful under- 
standing of his aims and duties by inquiring into the principles of 
teaching and the methods of instruction, into the help which psy- 
chology can offer, and into the limits which are set to it.

The

of the 

XX 
Century 



READ THIS 



Sudermann's many dramas and novels may be regarded as 
merely preliminary studies for this, his masterpiece. It is 
the story of a beautiful girl animated by high ideals and 
beset by temptations on every side. Lilly suggests, 
remotely, Daudet's Sappho and Dumas's Camille in a 
nobler embodiment. Alone in the world, loving and sym- 
pathetic by disposition, she encounters successively sordid 
poverty, wealth and libertinism, false love, dazzling Bohe- 
mianism, perfect bliss, then commonplace Philistinism. 
How she threads her way over high peaks and through dark 
valleys, how she resists and how she succumbs, are the 
actuating springs of a novel incomparable in this decade.

TAMAM 



By CHARLES CHILTON MOORE 

Neale Publishing- Company, New York. $1.50. 

" A very big thought in a very unusual and somstimes classic 
book." — Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in the New York Journal. 

"Quite unlike other books, and not amenable to classifica- 
tion, ' Tamam ' presents a series of studies of the inner life and* 
of psychological experience intertwined with pictures of the 
outer side of life, varied with pleasing descriptions of natural 
scenes, and all bound together with a thread of intense emotion 
afforded by the love of a strong, deep-natured man and a 
woman of equal strength of feeling. The author does not even 
give these two people names, and they pass in and out of the 
scenes almost as weirdly as if they were ghosts deeply colored 
with human passions. The book has a certain quiet strength 
combined with refinement of feeling, and is very well written. 
The title is a Persian word, meaning oblivion." — The New 
York Times, Jan. 30. 

"Some of the musings on life and death and sorrow and 
mystery are beautifully expressed, full of melancholy and 
pathos." — Louisville Courier-Journal. 

" The book is evidently written by a poet and a dreamer, and 
will be best appreciated by such." — Philadelphia Book News.

The delightfulness of nonsense appeals even to the philosopher. Dr. Carus has

in Wonderland, is deliciously absurd, and, at the same time, stimulating to deep thought.

READY THIS DAY 



A POLITICAL STUDY OF UNUSUAL IMPORTANCE 



The Promise of American Life 



By HERBERT CROLY 



The intellectual power of this hook will be unques- 
tioned. His analysis of the national democratic ideal 
in its relations to foreign affairs and to domestic prob- 
lems is logical, and his closing sections on constructive 
individualism are inspiring to an unusual degree. 



MR. CROLY examines thoroughly present economic 
and political conditions in their relation to the national 
principle of democracy. He reasons closely as to what 
may be expected in the future, and offers definite 
suggestions as to the directions in which improvement 
may be sought. 

The book will be a godsend to every man who has in his whole intellectual and moral make-up a fibre of pro- 
test against the aggressive, irresponsible, and merely practical Americanism of the day, or who looks beyond it 
in the direction of national intellectual independence and national moral union and good faith.

THE CASE OF P OE AN D HIS CRITICS. 

I. 

I am late in bringing my anniversary wreath to 
the memory of Poe. Perhaps while the awkward 
squad had reopened fire over his grave it was just 
as well to be silent. What I had to say could well 
wait till the spattering was over. 

Fortunate, as far as fame is concerned, is the 
man whose personality creates a legend. If there 
is something problematical in his character, or if 
various interpretations are read into his acts by 
others, his memory is pretty sure to be preserved. 
It does not matter that the legend is wholly or in 
part a lie ; or that the problem is capable of the 
simplest solution. The instinct of the baser part of 
mankind to besmirch greatness, the more legitimate 
interest of the most of us in strong contrasts of 
character and fate, and the generous impulses of 
the few who spring forward to defend those whom 
death has left defenseless, all conspire to create 
a perennial curiosity about the subject of such a 
legend. In this respect it is possible that Gris- 
wold's defamation has served Poe well. The 
slanderer has wrought the good where he only willed 
the evil. 

You cannot kill a legend. You may riddle it 
with logic or explode it with facts ; but the next day 
it is well and strong again, doing business at the old 
stand and imposing on the credulity of mankind by 
its air of venerable authority. There are just two 
indictments brought against Poe and measurably 
proved. One is that he occasionally drank too much. 
Now if we are going to rule out of the House of 
Fame all the men who have drunk too much, the 
ranks of the Immortals will be sadly thinned. 
Shakespeare and Burns and Byron, and probably 
Tennyson, will have to go. Considering that Poe, 
by the quantity and quality of his work, paid the 
world quite all the debt he owed it, the matter does 
not seem to concern the world at all. It did con- 
cern the two persons whom Poe loved and protected, 
but they do not appear to have minded his slight 
irregularities, and gave him a love and worship such 
as few men have won. It was no drunkard who 
evoked such affection. It was no drunkard who did 
Poe's work. It was no drunkard whose mind grew 
keener and clearer and loftier to the last. For 
myself, I believe that Poe's lapses into intemperance 
were probably a benefit to him. They relaxed his 
constant tension of nerve and brain. Certainly up 
to the last tragic and mysterious day of his life his 
nature always seemed capable of rebound to hope 
and purposeful activity. 

The other charge against Poe is, that in the failure 



368 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



of his desperate industry to provide for his family, 
he borrowed a few small sums which remained un- 
paid at his death. He may possibly have owed three 
or four hundred dollars. Goldsmith owed two or 
three thousand pounds ; yet he is the best beloved 
of English writers. Sir Walter Scott died owing 
thirty or forty thousand pounds ; yet no one has ever 
impeached his honor. Both of these men incurred 
their debts for the purposes of vain ostentation and 
display. Why, then, should Poe be hounded for his 
pitiful borrowings, all of which would probably have 
been made good had he lived ? 

No one is perfect. Matthew Arnold says that 
conduct is nine-tenths of life ; but he does not define 
what he means by conduct. The keeping of one or 
two commandments is certainly not all there is to it. 
You may be as pure as snow, as temperate as a horse- 
trough, and yet have no conduct at all worth speaking 
of. Arnold himself placed Byron in the forefront 
of modern poetry. He knew very well that the 
English poet had plenty of sins on his head, but he 
valued above these the courage and strength and 
haughty truthfulness which Byron displayed. Sim- 
ilarly Poe's petty failings, which have unquestion- 
ably been magnified a hundred fold, are absolutely 
trivial as set against his chivalrous love for his wife, 
his courtesy, his independence which would not 
cringe or flatter, the high standard to which he held 
his work, and the generosity with which he wel- 
comed his rivals. He stood aside as no man of his 
rank ever did before, and ushered his great contem- 
poraries, Tennyson, Dickens, Mrs. Browning, Home, 
Hawthorne, Lowell, and others, into their proper 
places. Possibly his only serious error in contem- 
porary criticism was his slighting tone towards 
Emerson. The two men were antipathetic, and we 
can no more blame them for not liking each other 
than we can blame Gray and Dr. Johnson for their 
mutual misprision. 

Voltaire said that the French had not epic heads. 
Well, the Americans have not poetic heads. It 
cannot be helped, and they are hardly to be blamed 
for it. They have a score of other good qualities, 
of which they are justly proud. But there is no use 
of their strutting about like Audrey, thanking God 
they are not poetical. The consensus of mankind 
has decided that to be really and truly poetical is a 
vastly fine thing — that it is in fact the crown and 
consummation of human fate. Our American judg- 
ments are not going to alter this verdict of the ages. 
It was Poe's misfortune that he, the most sensitive 
and visionary of the children of genius, had to be 
dropped into the place of practicality — the domain 
of the Dollar. Many of my readers may have seen 
that experiment in physics, where a cat is placed in 
the glass receiver of an air-pump and then the air 
gradually exhausted from it. They have seen poor 
pussie run about, utter plaintive cries, try to stop 
the outlet of the chamber with its paw, and finally 
turn over to die. Something like that was Poe's 
struggle in America. 



II. 

I have written so much about the various phases 
of Poe's genius, that I am rather at a loss for a novel 
view-point. Probably I had best try to answer some 
of the objections that have been repeatedly urged 
against his work, or have recently been re-stated. 
The most important of these concerns his supposed 
lack of matter, substance, import, profundity. Now 
it seems to me that there are two ways of being pro- 
found in literature. One is the way of gnomic utter- 
ance, of maxims, of words tagged with a direct 
moral purpose ; the other is the way of dramatic or 
pictorial projection of life, nature, and abstract 
imaginings. Let me go to the cognate art of paint- 
ing for an illustration. Hogarth is a great moralist ; 
he paints the plain results of vice and virtue, of 
industry and indolence. His pictures are embodi- 
ments of the ordinary maxims of prudence and 
worldly wisdom. No doubt they are impressive ; no 
doubt they are useful. But turn to an artist like 
Rembrandt. He tells no story, — it is impossible to 
make out what some of his pictures signify. He 
enforces no moral, — for he paints indifferently base 
subjects and noble ones. Yet has any student or 
critic ever doubted which of these two artists had the 
profounder nature, — which of the two art products 
is best calculated to impress, ennoble, and thrill man- 
kind ? Poe has little of the capability for gnomic 
wisdom which men like Dante, Shakespeare, and 
Goethe possessed, but he shares with them the power 
to dilate and move our minds by totality of effect. 
Everything he wrote, down to the merest journalistic 
scrap, bears the stamp of a singular and powerful 
nature. Like Rembrandt, he cannot escape his 
shadow, cannot avoid flashing forth his unearthly 
lights. Of course, as there are various grades of 
moral utterances, from the maxims of Tupper to the 
sayings of Shakespeare, so there are many kinds of 
moving or thrilling effects, suited to different orders 
of minds. Hawk's Eye the Detective will thrill an 
errand-boy more than Poe's "Murders in the Rue 
Morgue." But Poe has been tested by time. Intellects 
of the highest order have testified to his power over 
them. And this power is profundity. It only 
remains to ask whether this profundity works for 
good. Alas, that is the question which besets all 
great art. Is it really well for us to have the sorrows, 
passions, vices, crimes, diseases, madnesses, and mel- 
ancholy broodings of mankind realized and visualized 
in words ? The best opinion of all ages has decided 
that it is — that such literature is more tonic and for- 
tifying than visions of fools' paradises done in rose- 
water. The poet's intention is everything, in the use 
of such material. And in Poe's case there is cer- 
tainly no pandering to evil — no suggestions which 
would make for impurity or wrong. He is one of 
the purest-minded writers in literature. 

A second objection to Poe is that he fails of the 
genuine sublime. He moves, his critics say, in a 
region vaulted by fogs or smoke, amid charnal- 
houses and among grotesque monsters, and never

has a glimpse of the supreme things of life and 
nature. Again I would distinguish two kinds of 
sublimity. One I might call the moral sublime, and 
as examples of it I would quote the " God said, let 
there be light, and there was light " of the Script- 
ures. I would quote that passage in the Iliad where 
old Priam kneels before Achilles and kisses the 
hand red with his son's blood, and the mighty victor 
takes "pity on his gray hair and his gray beard." 
I would quote the scene where Dante parts with the 
immortal lovers in Hell, and says : " I wailed not, 
so I grew of stone within." I would quote King 
Lear's adjuration to the storm — 

"I tax you not, ye elements, with unkindness; 
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children." 

Or that other passage, where, his heart bursting in 
agony, he sighs out his last word, " Pray you undo 
this button." Of this kind of sublime, I am free to 
confess there is no touch or trace in Poe. But it is 
most rare anywhere. Milton hardly reaches it ; nor, 
I think, does Goethe. When I say this I do not for- 
get the high and haughty air which Milton exhibits. 
There is plenty of that in Poe, — in fact, his whole 
work is suffused with it. Nor do I forget the wild 
pathos which is in Goethe. There is a whole world 
of sorrow and regret in Poe's poetry. But the pas- 
sages I have quoted combine the utmost significance 
with the utmost simplicity. Words disappear in the 
blaze of meaning. 

The other kind of sublime, the physical sublime, 
is common enough. It is the stuff out of which 
most of the masterpieces of literature are fashioned. 
At the risk of being tedious, I will again give in- 
stances. There is the picture in Homer of Apollo 
descending from the Olympian towers, the arrows 
rattling in the quiver on his back as he strides 
along, until, seating himself against the ships, he 
sends his shafts down, and pestilence and death and 
the blaze of funeral pyres follow their flight. There 
are the red towers of Dis flickering up through the 
gloom, the flaked rain of fire, the rosy figures of 
the messenger angels which make a little dawn in 
Hell, — these and a hundred other pictures are in 
Dante. There is the Spirit of the Cape which ap- 
pears to Vasco de Gama in Camoen's poem. There 
is Milton's Lucifer rising from his fate, " Like Tene- 
riffe or Atlas unremoved." There is his meeting 
at the gates of Hell with the awful figures of Sin 
and Death. And there is picture after picture of 
strange invention in Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner." 
Of this kind of sublime, I say that Poe is crowded 
f ulj. Turn to the " Manuscript Found in a Bottle" 
or the last pages of the " Narrative of Arthur 
Gordon Pym." Consider " The Masque of the Red 
Death" or "The Fall of the House of Usher," or 
that group of strange colloquies which preceeded and 
preluded the phantasmal imaginings of " Eureka." 
In all of these, Poe works with a power of inven- 
tion, a vividness of realization, not unequal to the 
great writers I have quoted. I judge that it was 
the thinness, the poverty of their ordinary themes, 



which at the last drove two of our best men, Bryant 
and Longfellow, to translating Homer and Dante. 
Poe tried, and not unsuccessfully, to rival the mas- 
ters out of his own resources. 
IH. 

Poe was in the main a tragic poet ; and his 
necessary preoccupation with tbings of fear and 
horror gives offence. There are many who consider 
him merely a superior writer of shilling shockers. 
Well, in my judgment the shilling shocker has more 
in common with the masterpieces of literature than 
the novels of nothingness which infest the world 
to-day. The Agamemnon, ^Edipus, Macbeth, Lear, 
Duchess of Malfi, Bride of Lammermoor, Wuthering 
Heights, and Faust, are all shilling shockers, done by 
first-rate literary hands. Nothing in Poe exceeds — 
I doubt if anything equals — the sheer horror out 
of which those works are made. 

The judgment against Poe, however, is partly his 
own fault ; for he adopted from the German writers 
on aesthetics the theory that Beauty is the sole aim 
and end of art. Such a theory is destructive of the 
value of the most of his own work. Not Beauty 
alone, but Beauty and Power together, are the rulers 
of art. They are the wife and husband from whose 
union spring the flower and flame — like children of 
the imagination. And they can exist separately; 
they do not have to lean on each other. Power can 
combine with Beauty and produce the noble and 
the heroic ; but it can ignore and nullify Beauty and 
bring forth the terrible, the grotesque, the comic, 
and the ugly. Poe's gifts, in spite of his theory, 
tended in the direction of Power. Yet in his verse 
Beauty has the supremacy, though shadowed by her 
great and gloomy mate. And in a few of his prose 
pieces — "The Valley of the Many Colored Grass," 
" The Domain of Arnheim," " Landor's Cottage " — 
he embodies Beauty by itself. These pieces deal 
with landscape ; they are imaginings of Edens with 
not enough of human presence in them to cause the 
serpent to enter. 

Poe's lack of emotion troubles some people. He 
had no heart, they say. He had a hard fight with 
the world, and did not wear his heart upon his 
sleeve, perhaps ; and in the mass of his work, nar- 
rative or dramatic, a display of personal emotion 
would have been out of place. Dramatic emotion 
they have in plenty ; perhaps some of them are too 
much aquiver with nerves and sensibilities. But 
his poetry was mainly personal, — it rose out of and 
was colored by the happenings of his life. Certainly 
there is no lack of personal feeling, of admiration, 
love, sorrow, regret, in "To Helen," " The Sleeper," 
" Annabel Lee," " For Annie," and " The Raven." 
But critics presume to say that these pieces are too 
poetical to be real expressions of emotion, that such 
is not the way they would phrase love or sorrow. 
Probably not. But then, beauty is the necessary 
result of the poet's gift. It was just as easy and 
natural for Poe to make those things rich and rare 
in imagery and music as it would be for an ordinary

man to put his love and sorrow into commonplace 
words. The sonnet to his wife's mother is plain 
enough, yet in tenderness and sweetness it is a 
worthy rival of Cowper's sonnet to Mary Unwin, 
which Palgrave thought the most exquisite and 
pathetic in the language. Poe's last letters bear out 
the contention that he was a being peculiarly swayed 
by affection and emotion. I confess I do not like 
them ; they seem to me too unrestrained, unreserved. 
Reading them is like holding a bird in one's hand 
and feeling its heart throb. Either a man should be 
more of a stoic, or it is a desecration to print such 
things. But altogether the heartless Poe is the most 
foolish bogey of his defamers. 

Poe is one of the few masters in English litera- 
ture who have succeeded in making prose perform 
the work of poetry. The English translators of the 
Bible, and Shakespeare, did this before him ; but 
hardly anybody else. The professed writers of the 
so-called prose-poetry do not do it at all. The best 
they achieve merely makes one say, " That is very 
pretty." Poe uses none of the artifices of these 
writers, their rhythms, alliterations, accumulations 
of images. His prose is generally as simple, lucid, 
straightforward, as that of Swift or Defoe. Yet 
when we put down a tale of his, one note of music 
is ringing in our ears, one harmony of hue is gleam- 
ing in our eyes. How does he reach this result? 
Mainly, by perfect fitness of detail, by harmony, by 
tone, all directed to a final effect. With Dante and 
Shakespeare, he is one of the great tone-masters of 
literature. 

Leaving out "The Raven," Poe got his largest 
and most potent effects in prose ; but it is of course 
in verse that he reaches his highest levels of expres- 
sion. In magic and melody he is overmatched 
among modern English poets by Coleridge, Keats, 
and Tennyson alone, and by them only in quantity, 
not in quality. Such lines as 

" To the glory that was Greece 
And the grandeur that was Rome," 

" No more, no more, no more 
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree, 
Or the stricken eagle soar," 

" In what ethereal dances, 
By what eternal streams," 

these have the seal of ultimate perfection on them. 
And whole poems have this stamp. Longfellow's 
" Beleaguered City " is a fine poem, admirable in 
conception and adequate in execution. But when 
we turn to Poe's " Haunted Palace " we are in a 
different region of art altogether. Every phrase, 
every cadence glows or sings with some unique or 
wonderful light or sound. "Israfel" has less 
sparkle and color, but it too is divinely cadenced. 
" Ulalume " is not only the most Poesque of the 
poems, but it is the germ of a vast amount of recent 
poetry. 

" Come up through the lair of the Lion, 
With love in her luminous eyes." 



or. 



or. 



Is not that the pattern which Swinburne largely 
followed ? " The Raven " is Poe's most deliberate 
attempt to do a large thing. It has story, charac- 
ters, and scene, as well as emotion and atmosphere, 
and deserves its place in popular esteem. Unfor- 
tunately, there is not very much of Poe's poetry, — 
but then there is not much of Catullus, Collins, Gray, 
Coleridge at his best. Left to his verse alone, I 
should rank Poe somewhere amid this group — a 
fascinating master of words, melody, and emotional 
utterance, but hardly a world-power. In prose, how- 
ever, he is the supreme artist of the short story ; and 
the man who rules absolutely one of the forms of lit- 
erature has his place with the kings. 

One argument more. It is patent, though attempts 
are made to deny it, that Poe's fame is more wide- 
spread that than of any writer of English since 
Byron. I think we may take it for granted that the 
Supreme Court of European Opinion knows some- 
thing. Europe has plenty of great poets and prose 
writers of its own ; and if it adopts and imitates Poe, 
as it does not adopt or imitate any other recent 
English or American writer, it must be because he 
has an intense and universal appeal which these 
others lack. Why, I would ask, if Poe is wanting 
in profundity, if his sole merit is form, why is he 
operative at such great distances and in other lan- 
guages ? Form is practically untranslatable. As is 
the case with the Italian poet Leopardi, it is his 
superior weight of meaning, the significance of his 
whole character and thought, which enables him to 
overrun the boundaries of his own country and 
speech. Tennyson, like that other Italian poet 
Carducci, is shut up at home. 

The wheel has come full-circle. The strange mis- 
shapen stone rejected by the builders has become the 
top of the temple. For myself, I have never doubted 
Poe's supremacy in American literature. When I 
was a boy of seventeen or eighteen I wrote an elegy 
on him, in which, while accepting somewhat of the 
current estimate of his character, I placed his work 
where I do now. To-day I have come to believe that 
his nature was essentially as fine as his art. I think 
him a fit companion for the solemn, sweet, and wrath- 
ful Dante, whom his own city would have burned if 
it could have laid hands on him. I think him a 
worthy comrade for Spain's bravest, truest son, 
Miguel Cervantes, who was mocked, starved, im- 
prisoned by his countrymen during his lifetime, and 
more or less hated by them for a century after his 
death. Wherever I turn my gaze upon Poe, whether 
in his early and utter destitution in Baltimore, in hi6 
period of comparative peace and prosperity in Phil- 
adelphia, or in those days of desolation when he 
paced the fir-shadowed slopes of the Bronx or the 
starlit footpath of the Harlem bridge, I can see 
nothing but an honest, serious, noble gentleman, a 
poet haunted by higher and more vivid visions than 
any of his compeers, and capable of expressing them 
in terms of a more splendid art.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



" Shaw as a Social Symptom " is the alluring 
caption under which Dr. Stanton Coit, lecturer for 
the West London Ethical Culture Society, has been 
telling America about his witty, talented, and ver- 
satile English friend. Mr. Coit admits a doubt about 
America's attitude toward Shaw ; and he displays 
some confusion of thought in his own attitude 
toward America. This comes out when, for exam- 
ple, he characterizes Mr. Roosevelt as not only 
symptomatic of to-day, like Shaw, but also symbolic 
of all America. But when Dr. Coit comes to the 
point of explaining what he thinks about Shaw and 
wants America to understand about him, he is 
admirably clear, definite, and entertaining. He 
considers Shaw's wit the legitimate successor to 
Voltaire's ; his prose style comparable only to Shake- 
speare's, Bacon's, Milton's, and Jeremy Taylor's; 
and his ideas " symptomatic of his own time — and 
very little more." That is, Shaw is interesting in 
being perfectly typical of his age ; but his horizon 
is very limited. He is over-occupied with the Phil- 
istinism of the English " middle class "; he has 
known too much of the seamy side of life ; is too 
prone to regard his own experience as universal, 
and the world, accordingly, as stupid, silly, small- 
souled, mean-spirited, blind to ideas, indifferent to 
decency. Dr. Coit finds the whole excuse for this 
limited point of view in Shaw's lack of educational 
advantages, and in his long and desperate struggle, 
not for recognition only, but for a bare livelihood. 
We should suspect that it is also a temperamental 
limitation, often associated with a keen wit. Dr. 
Coit naturally refuses to consider Shaw as either a 
poseur or a self-advertiser. Very much in earnest 
himself, he is assured that his friend and co-worker 
is equally in earnest : and his argument carries con- 
viction. In fairness to Dr. Coit, it should be said 
that he has delivered a number of lectures on vari- 
ous phases of Shaw's genius, besides the one which, 
in inclusive fashion, sums up his contribution to the 
thought of the day. And, as Dr. Coit remarked, 
Shaw is soon coming to America himself, and there 
■will then be an excellent opportunity to compare 
him with Dr. Coit's impression, Mr. Chesterton's 
biography, and the famous " Prefaces." 

A MONUMENT OF INDUSTRY AND SCHOLARSHIP is 

a term that may be applied in no grudging way to 
the brand-new " Webster's International Dictionary" 
with which Messrs. G. & C Merriam have crowned 
the long historic line of Webster's Dictionaries 
issued by that no less historic house. In no previ- 
ous issue, however, has there been such an advance, 
such a remaking and remodelling and reconstruc- 
tion of the work, as is shown in the present colossal 
volume. It is, first of alL ' ; new from cover to 
cover "; it is essentially " a new dictionary of the 
English language." Its immediate predecessor, the 
" International " of twenty years ago, was a big 



dictionary, but compared with this one it seems but 
a juvenile to an adult. The statement that the 
number of words included is more than doubled 
sounds incredible, but it is true ; the earlier work 
had 175,000 title-words, this one has over 400,000. 
All the earlier entries have been rigidly revised, to 
harmonize with the advance of scholarship and the 
development of the science of lexicography. The 
encyclopaedic character of the work has been ex- 
tended to correspond with the marvellous extension 
of the boundaries of knowledge, so that the work is 
more than ever a " storehouse of information." 
New words are freely introduced, as are also many 
terms which, originating in slang, have passed into 
common use. The principle laid down is that a 
dictionary is not a literary dictator, but a chronicler 
of existing usage : obviously a sound position, one 
of the results of which is that fantastic spellings 
such as are proposed by " Simplified Spelling " 
boards have no place in this vocabulary. Still 
more significant of conservative tendencies in ortho- 
graphy is the restoration of such forms as honour, 
labour, endeavour, and even favour, — a rather 
extreme reaction, we should say, from the almost 
fanatical anti-English proclivities of Noah Webster, 
which have been the source of so much of the con- 
fusion that has prevailed in our American spelling. 
As a piece of book-making, the work is one of the 
greatest achievements of American typography. The 
type is open-faced and legible, the print sharp and 
clear ; the illustrations — six thousand in number — 
are well executed and authentic. A novel feature of 
the book is the division of each page into two distinct 
portions — the lower part, about a fifth of the page, 
being used for the less important words, in smaller 
type, thus effecting a material saving of space ; 
while the upper four-fifths, containing the more im- 
portant terms, is in the larger and more easily con- 
sulted print. These are but a few of the many 
excellent features of a work to which the old-time 
adjuration "Get the Best" must potently apply.

The diversions of the mathematical mind 
might very excusably be of a frivolous sort, to 
counterbalance the severe application required of 
him who essays to enlarge the world's knowledge of 
the properties of numbers. And in noteworthy 
instances this frivolity is found to prevail. The late 
Augustus de Morgan, whose mathematical works are 
still authoritative, and whose " Budget of Para- 
doxes " will long appeal to the curious reader, is said 
to have had an insatiable appetite for novels, so that 
he would sit up half the night over a genuine 
" thriller." It is his son, Mr. William de Morgan, 
who has, since passing his sixty-sixth birthday, been 
entertaining the English-speaking world with an 
annual essay in fiction — not being, it is true, a math- 
ematician before that, but presumably having some 
slight tincture of mathematics in his blood, since, 
besides his father, his maternal grandfather, William 
Frend, and his great-great-grandfather, James Dod- 
son (mathematical master at Christ's Hospital and

author of "The Anti-Logarithmic Canon"), were 
strong in this branch of learning. Our well-known 
American novelist, Arthur Sherburne Hardy, author 
of " Passe Rose'" and other good stories, was a col- 
lege teacher of mathematics ; and the ever-delightful 
romancer for children, Lewis Carroll, was likewise 
a mathematical professor and the author of severely 
abstruse mathematical works. But the man of 
science need not take shame to himself for reading 
or writing good and wholesome tales. Benjamin 
Jowett, the famous master of Balliol, once wrote in a 
letter to the daughter of John Addington Symonds : 
" There are few ways in which people can be better 
employed than in reading a good novel." 

The vocabulary of aerial navigation is 
rapidly growing, but the demand for new terms is 
outstripping the supply. Awkward compounds and 
hideous hybrids are tentatively suggested and meet 
with a degree of favor ; but obviously apt and con- 
veniently short new words for all these new things 
are conspicuously wanting. The poetry and charm 
of this new mode of motion will be better preserved 
by the adoption of simple untechnical terms for 
common use, than by going further afield and im- 
porting into the language a strictly scientific nomen- 
clature of Greek derivation. Why should not 
" airship " prove as acceptable and useful as "steam- 
ship "? The sky-craft of the future will, with little 
doubt, be aeroplanes, or heavier-than-air machines, 
and for the less-used gas-bags of our grandfathers 
the word " balloon " will continue to be the proper 
designation, leaving "airship" to denote the later 
models of cloud-chasers. Airships may be more 
particularly described as of the monoplane, biplane, 
or triplane type, just as we speak of single-screw, 
twin-screw, and triple-screw steamships. "Aero- 
drome " may be preferred to " airship racecourse," 
and " aerodock " to " airship shed "; but in general 
the more readily intelligible and less technical 
terms are to be preferred. Already our vocabulary 
is growing fast enough without undue multiplication 
of polysyllabic formations put together in the labo- 
ratory or the library.

An octogenarian college freshman affords 
a striking example of the perennially fresh appeal 
of literature and learning. Mrs. A. D. Winship, 
aged seventy-nine, after attending the summer school 
of the Ohio State University, is reported to have en- 
tered upon the regular college curriculum, and to 
have planned a course of study that should keep 
her pleasantly occupied until she is ninety. Pre- 
sumably she has not entered the engineering depart- 
ment, or the school of agriculture, or chosen exclus- 
ively sciences and laboratory work ; it must then 
have been the undying delights of book-learning that 
attracted her. " Learning is ever in the freshness 
of its youth, even for the old," says JEschylus in 
the "Agamemnon." A maxim of Publius Syrus 
affirms that "It is better to learn late than never"; 
perhaps it is, in some respects, better to learn late 



than early — more enjoyable to the mature learner 
than to the foolish and impatient youngster. Many 
a gray -haired possessor of a college diploma might 
profitably and with pleasure go back to his Latin, 
Greek, and Mathematics, with judicious selection 
from modern additions to this bill of fare, and spend 
another quadrennium in academic seclusion, taking 
a fresh parchment (if he could pass the examina- 
tions) at the end. Happy, thrice and four times 
happy Mrs. Winship, who like Shakespeare's Portia 
is " happy in this, she is not yet so old but she may 
learn." . . . 

The literary likings of book-thieves are not 
necessarily indicated by the titles of the books they 
steal. A purloiner of Audubon's " Birds of Amer- 
ica " — supposing that massive and costly work 
could be unostentatiously abstracted from some pub- 
lic or private library — need not be an enthusiastic 
ornithologist ; nor would the misappropriator of a 
Mazarine Bible be likely to be a truly religious per- 
son. The St. Joseph (Mo.) Public Library reports 
some rather curious stealings among its last year's 
book-thefts. Four were religious books, — Proud- 
foot's « Child's Christ Tales," Peabody's " Mornings 
in the College Chapel," Keedy's "Teacher's Book 
of Old Testament Heroes," and Drummond's " Ad- 
dresses." Useful arts were unceremoniously drawn 
upon to the extent of twenty-two volumes ; but the 
lighter sort of fiction proved to be the favorite 
department with these light-fingered patrons of lit- 
erature, fifty-eight novels being removed without 
troubling the perhaps already overworked young 
person at the delivery desk. May it not be that our 
American love of short-cuts and hatred of red-tape 
are accountable for many of these unrecorded bor- 
rowings, and that many, or perhaps most, of the 
missing volumes will return as silently as they stole 
away ? 

Oliver Otis Howard, soldier, author, and 
educator, whose memorable Autobiography ap- 
peared two years ago (reviewed at length in The 
Dial of Oct. 16, 1907), died suddenly at his home 
in Burlington, Vermont, on the 26th of October. 
" The American Havelock " and " the Christian 
soldier " were the well-deserved titles of honor be- 
stowed upon him by his comrades in the army. 
His most gallant and most effective service to the 
Union cause was rendered at the battle of Gettys- 
burg, where his resolute holding of an important 
position in the face of tremendous odds probably 
saved the day — if, indeed, any one act of bravery 
and of tactical wisdom can be said to have decided 
the issue on that occasion. As founder and presi- 
dent of Lincoln Memorial University, as a zealous 
promoter of negro education, as author of one of the 
best of our military autobiographies, as occasional 
contributor to the magazines, and as advocate of 
various charitable causes (educational, missionary, 
and in behalf of temperance), General Howard has 
made his influence felt in his day and generation, 
and he will not soon be forgotten.

The evolution of a new word, or of a new 
meaning of an old word, or the gradual passage of 
a slang term from bad company into polite society, 
or of an irreproachable word from refined circles 
into base fellowship, is always interesting to those 
who believe that the elements of language are as much 
alive as the elements of the landscape. The attention 
of language-lovers and language-students has of late 
been called to a curious usage of the word " near," 
a term that already has proved adaptable to divers 
requirements. A "near-winner," in the vocabulary 
of the day, of course needs no explanation ; nor does 
u near-silk goods " nor a " near-gold ring." A journal 
with some pretensions to correctness in its English 
recently reported the breaking up of a meeting in a 
" near-riot." An aspiring versifier might be called 
(by a cruel critic) a "near-poet," and a ward politi- 
cian a " near-statesman." A miss is as good as a 
mile, and no one would feel unduly puffed up by 
this ascription of near-greatness. Taken all in all, 
the little word "near," in its varied uses and mean- 
ings as adjective, adverb, verb, and near-preposition, 
is an interesting and fruitful study. 

A popular misconception relating to the mone- 
tary rewards of literary endeavor is well illustrated 
by an anecdote now passing current about Dr. Cook, 
the Arctic explorer. Report has it that having been 
cabled to by a prominent publisher to name his price 
for book and serial rights in the story of his Polar 
journey, Dr. Cook cabled back that he wanted 
8500,000. If the story is true, it shows that the 
explorer shared the popular superstition ; if not, it 
attests the subtle psychological understanding of 
the person who invented it. The average reader 
would accept the story without question and without 
considering the doctor's demand at all exorbitant. 
How easy to write a book, and what a lot of money 
you can get for it ! Thus pleasantly vague is the 
average man's snap-shot judgment of authorship. 
By the same course of reasoning another fallacy is 
arrived at : because many successful authors have 
tried and failed at law, medicine, or business, the 
man who has not made a success of his profession 
may embark hopefully on a literary career. Liter- 
ature is sometimes lucrative ; but as a get-rich-quick 
scheme, or last resource in misfortune, it is scarcely 
to be recommended. 



FROM LITERARY LONDON. 



(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
Mr. Hall Caine has issued a pamphlet, originally 
a lecture, entitled " Why I Wrote 'The White Pro- 
phet,' " — an attempt on his part, of course, to give 
an additional vogue to his novel of that name, which, 
as I have already explained, has fallen exceedingly 
flat in this country. The booksellers have been dis- 
posed to attribute its comparative failure to the fact 
that Mr. Heinemann issued it in two volumes, the 
public having become accustomed of late years to 



novels in one volume only. I think, however, there 
are other reasons for this failure, one of them being 
that the novel had had a very wide circulation in the 
pages of our most successful monthly, " The Strand 
Magazine "; and perhaps another reason is that a 
large part of the novel-reading public has got some- 
what tired of Mr. Hall Caine's infinite propensity for 
booming himself. He is not likely to gain much by 
his pamphlet explaining why he wrote " The White 
Prophet." K people will not read the book they 
are not likely to be interested in knowing why its 
author wrote it ; and Mr. Caine's proposition that 
booksellers should place this pamphlet in their shops, 
and push it as much as possible, is not likely to mend 
matters. 

Meanwhile Mr. Hall Caine has secured the 
alliance of the man in all England the most remote 
from his peculiar talent — Mr. George Bernard 
Shaw. Mr. Shaw has written a preface to " The 
White Prophet," terse, eloquent, and to the point. 
While one of Mr. Caine's weaknesses is his redun- 
dancy of words, his singular faculty for what may 
be termed " gush," Mr. Shaw's writings are char- 
acterized by a fine directness of style which one 
might have thought would have led him to find " The 
White Prophet " an absolute offence. Why, then, is 
he so enthusiastic ? The reason is clear. Although 
Mr. Shaw is himself an artist, he has no love of art 
for art's sake. Shelley appeals to him, not by his 
divine poetic gift, but by his passion for reform. 
Mr. Shaw is not worried in the least by Mr. Hall 
Caine's lack of artistry, his empty rhetoric, his ver- 
bosity ; all he sees is a man who wants to reform 
the present system of ruling Egypt, and is indignant 
at certain actions of the British Government in 
connection with that rule. 

This attitude of Mr. Shaw, however, is not an 
uncommon one with smaller minds than his. For 
example, a somewhat colorless review of Mt. Caine's 
novel appeared in " The Nation," a London journal 
of advanced democratic sympathies. The writer of 
the review took occasion to throw in a word or two 
of condemnation of Mr. Caine's novel as a novel, 
whereupon a correspondent wrote to denounce the 
editor for receiving too coldly so strong a manifesto 
on behalf of Egyptian nationalism. I contend that 
this writer, in common with Mr. Shaw, is thoroughly 
wrong-headed ; that a reviewer has to ask himself 
solely whether a novel is a good piece of literature, 
not whether it is a good tract. The only thing that 
can justify a tract being circulated as literature is 
success. If a million copies of Mr. Hall Caine's 
tract on behalf of Egyptian nationalism had been sold, 
few would have dared to deny that it was literature. 
Mr. Caine, by the way, declares that he " has touched 
thousands of hearts." I am reminded of Goethe, 
to whom someone said, " Your business, poet, is to 
touch the feeling heart." "Ah, those feeling hearts! " 
Goethe replied ; " any blockhead can touch them ! " 

Considerable interest has been excited in the sale 
to Mr. Pierpont Morgan, for four thousand dollars, 
of three of Mr. George Meredith's manuscripts —

" Diana of the Crossways," " Lord Ormont and his

certainly represents the high-water mark of material 
value set upon manuscripts of recent English writers. 
Hitherto Robert Louis Stevenson and Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling have been first favorites, at least in this 
country and among recent prose writers. Yet how 
disproportionate seems the price paid by Mr. Mor- 
gan, when one considers the emoluments of authors 
of the best quality. Many of Mr. Meredith's books 
must have been sold outright, in his earlier years, 
for much less money. Charlotte Bronte" sold " Jane 
Eyre " outright for twenty-five hundred dollars in 
even less happy days for the successful writer ; and 
her publishers have been offered more than that 
amount for the original manuscript. 

Mr. Hilaire Belloc is one of the clever young 
men of to-day in London. He is also a great friend 
of Mr. Gilbert Chesterton. The two may frequently 
be seen together, sometimes in a hansom cab, where 
the portly figure of Mr. Chesterton almost crushes 
out of sight the more modest form of his companion. 
It is generally believed that Mr. Belloc was the 
primary influence in carrying Chesterton over to 
the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Belloc comes of 
a French family, although his mother was English. 
His sister, Mrs. Belloc Lownes, has written novels 
and miscellaneous works. She bears a startling 
resemblance to the grandmother, a Madame Belloc, 
whose portrait may be seen in the Galleries of the 
Louvre. Hilaire Belloc himself is a writer of marked 
talent, especially where French history is concerned. 
His books on Robespierre and Dauton have just 
been followed by one on Marie Antoinette. The 
story of that pathetic Queen has been told many 
times and by many pens, but never more brilliantly 
than in this volume. 

I write, however, of Mr. Belloc to-day, only to 
disagree with him. He has been giving an address 
on literature, and in it he suggested that the novel 
was doomed. It had had its hundred and fifty years 
run, and the time was fast coming when we should 
hear no more of it. I do not think novel-lovers 
need be alarmed at the prospect. I cannot foresee 
the time when people will not read novels. There 
will be all kinds of developments in the novel, but 
in one form or another it will doubtless remain 
with us. Mr. Belloc is fond of history, and perhaps 
he does not care for works of imagination ; but 
while people are born with imagination it will find 
expression through the medium of poetry or through 
the medium of fiction. At present it seems that the 
public will not read poetry ; I doubt very much if 
we shall ever again renew the experience which 
gave colossal sales in succession to Walter Scott, to 
Lord Byron, and to Tennyson. A love of poetry 
may come again, but we are certain also to have a 
love of prose fiction. This last branch of art, in- 
deed, shows no decay, although Mr. Belloc appar- 
ently thinks it does. Every year produces a few 
really good novels which I imagine will be read for 
many years to come. Clement K. Shorter. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



POE, STEVENSON, AND BERANGER. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
In his essay " On the Enjoyment of Unpleasant 
Places," Robert Louis Stevenson tells us that while 
sojourning at some time in his youth on a certain bare 
and rock-bound coast in the North country, he was for 
some inexplicable reason continually haunted by two 
lines from Be'ranger : 

" Mon cceur est un luth suspendu ; 
Sitot qu'on le touche, il r^sonne." 

Professor William Lyon Phelps, in commenting on 
these lines in his excellent little volume of Stevenson's 
Essays, makes the suggestion that Stevenson probably 
found the lines " not in the original, but in reading the 
tales of Poe." For, as he points out, the same lines are 
used at the beginning of " The Fall of the House of 
Usher." Professor Phelps, however, goes on to say that 
in the first of these lines as quoted by Poe " the third 
and not the first person is used," — that is, the line 
reads, " Son cceur est un luth suspendu." In this he is 
correct; but he is in error when he implies that Stev- 
enson tampered with his text. For by referring to the 
poem of Be'ranger's in which the lines occur — his " Le 
Ref us," of which Professor Phelps makes no mention — 
it will be seen that the two lines occur there just as 
Stevenson quoted them, which pretty well establishes 
that Stevenson got them, not from Poe, who, as is well 
known, was often inaccurate in his quotations, but from 
Be'ranger himself. 

But the lines are interesting in another connection. 
The keynote of Poe's magic lyric of the angel Israfel 
is struck in the second line of that poem, " Whose 
heartstrings are a lute," words that were ultimately 
incorporated also in the motto of the poem and with 
the rest erroneously accredited to the Koran. Now, 
comparison of Poe's line with the first of the lines from 
Be'ranger brings out a striking resemblance between the 
two. Indeed, Poe's line " Whose heartstrings are a 
lute," is not a bad translation of Be'ranger's line as Poe 
subsequently "misquoted it, "Son cceur est uu luth sus- 
pendu." The resemblance has been noticed by at least 
two of Poe's editors, Professor James A. Harrison in 
his life of Poe (p. 156), and Professor A. G. Newcomer 
in his book entitled " Poe: Poems and Tales " (p. 300). 
But neither of these gentlemen has ventured to assert 
that there is any actual connection between the two. 
Nevertheless I make bold to suggest that Poe's line — 
and with it the ground-idea of " Israfel " — was ulti- 
mately derived from Be'ranger's line. The fact that 
Poe used Be'ranger's lines as the motto of his " House 
of Usher," first published nearly ten years after " Isra- 
fel " appeared, can hardly be held to militate against 
this view. The only difficulty in the way — and it is 
possibly an insuperable one — is that of dates. 

Poe first published " Israfel " in 1831, in the volume 
of poems brought out soon after his dismissal from 
West Point. Be'ranger's lines were also published in 
1831, if those of his editors who mention any date are 
to be relied on; besides, the poem in which they ap- 
peared has to do with an incident that occurred late in 
1830 or early in 1831: Be'ranger's refusal of a pension 
offered to him by his friend, General Se'bastiani, Min- 
ister of Foreign Affairs. Poe's 1831 volume of poems 
appeared, as 1 have said, soon after his dismissal from

West Point — therefore after March 6, 1831 : perhaps 
very soon after, perhaps (as Ingram holds) several 
months after. My theory is that " Le Refus " was first 
published in January, 1831, in some Paris newspaper — 
perhaps Le Figaro — in which during the month of 
January, according to the bibliographer of Be'ranger, 
M. Jules Brivois, the Hues "A mes amis devenus 
ministres " (which deal with a closely related subject} 
were first published; and that Poe became acquainted 
with it toward the end of that month, or in the follow- 
ing month, in the bbrary of the Military Academy or 
through some fellow cadet who subscribed for the Paris 
newspapers, and that he wrote his " Israfel " under the 
inspiration it afforded. That the West Point cadets 
were interested in current happenings in France in 1830 
and 1831 is established by a letter from them to Gen- 
eral Lafayette congratulating him on the victory of 
July, 1830, which was published in Le Monileur Uni- 
versel for January 8, 1831 ; and that Poe shared in this 
interest in happenings on the continent is shown by a 
letter of his, of March 10, 183 V to General Thayer, 
Superintendent of the Academy, in which he expresses 
an eagerness to proceed to Pans in the hope of securing 
through Lafayette, who had been a friend of his pater- 
nal grandfather's, an appointment in the Polish army. 
Further examination of the Paris papers of the time, 
only a few of which have been accessible to me, would 
perhaps suffice to clear up the question of dates here. 
The question of conscious indebtedness is, in the nature 
of the case, one that we can hardly hope to settle with 
any absoluteness. Killis Campbell.

SPELLING REFORM AND ITS OPPONENTS. 
CTo the Editor of The Dl\l.) 

Professor Shorey's article on Professor Lounsbury's 
" English Spelling and Spelling Reform " is what Horace 
Greeley would have called " mighty interesting read- 
ing," — even if one cannot apply to it another phrase of 
that plainspoken journalist and delare that it is " signifi- 
cant of much." Yet it has a significance of its own, 
which I beg your permission to point out. 

Most of the strenuous assailants of simplified spelling 
have seen fit wisely to shroud themselves in anonymity; 
and only three men, whose studies entitle them to be 
heard on a linguistic question, have ventured to warrant 
their opinions with their signatures. They are, Presi- 
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali- 
fornia, Professor Harry Thurston Peck of Columbia 
University, and Professor Paul Shorey of the University 
of Chicago. And what is significant is that they are all 
three of them specialists in the dead languages. No 
scholar in any one of the living languages has seen fit 
to join himself to these opponents of orthographic ameli- 
oration. Indeed, the Modern Language Association of 
America has formally approved of the recommendations 
of the Simplified Spelling Board. And a large majority 
of the professors of English in our universities are 
heartily in sympathy with the movement to give our 
noble language a simpler spelling. 

Although Professor Shorey seems to be willing to 
sneer at Professor Lounsbury's scholarship, I feel sure 
that he would be unwilling to misrepresent Professor 
Lounsbury's statements. Yet it is a misrepresentation 
for Professor Shorey to suggest that Professor Louns- 
bury has confest defeat. Apparently Professor Shorey 



overlookt those pages in which Professor Lounsbury 
exprest his unexpected satisfaction with the progress 
made by the simplified spelling movement. 

Brander Matthews. 
Columbia University, November 3, 1909. 

[We are glad to print Professor Matthews's letter, 
if for nothing else than its interesting disclosure that 
open and authentic opposition to simplified spelling 
in this country is limited to three dauntless scholastics 

— one of them on the Atlantic Seaboard, one in the 
Middle West, and one on the Pacific Coast : cer- 
tainly large fields for them to cover. Professor 
Matthews is, however, possibly mistaken in infer- 
ring, as he seemingly does, that there are no more 
of them ; mistaken also, we cannot help thinking, in 
believing that " a large majority of the professors of 
English in our universities are heartily in sympathy 
with the movement to give our noble language a 
simpler spelling " — if by this ample phrase he 
means that they are heartily in sympathy with the 
work and purposes of the Simplified Spelling Board. 
Or it may be that he is not so much mistaken as be- 
wildered. The number of educated persons who do 
not accept Simplified Spelling is hardly to be judged 
by the number of those who actively and publicly 
oppose it. People may dissent from any special cult 

— Spiritism, Faith Healing, Single Tax — without 
forming anti societies and making opposition to these 
cults one of the serious affairs of life. There are as 
yet no signs of the formation of societies endowed 
and equipped for advocating Complex Spelling, the 
absence of which seems to fill our enthusiastic Sim- 
plifiers with confidence that they possess the field. 
It is conceivable that a man may be in hearty sym- 
pathy with "orthographic amelioration," to use 
Professor Matthews's ingratiating phrase, and yet 
shudder at the prospect of the rude linguistic sur- 
gery by which the short-cut reformers would bring 
it about. When Lowell said that all good people 
were bound to be socialists in his meaning of the 
term, he meant that they were bound to desire social 
amelioration, not that they must embrace a specific 
radical programme and propaganda. That the mass 
of educated people do not actively oppose Spelling 
Reform by no means proves that they favor it, — 
perhaps they have not taken the matter seriously ; 
in Pater's phrase, it has not greatly impressed 
them. — Edr. The Dial.] 



BOOK PUBLISHERS AND SIMPLIFIED SPELLING. 
(To the Editor of The Diai*) 

Will you permit me to express my cordial agreement 
with Professor Shorey's views on the question of English 
spelling, as set forth in your issue of November 1. Any 
attempt to bring about changes more rapidly than they 
come by the unconscious process of linguistic evolution 
can only be a source of anarchy. I think our leading 
publishing houses have done a great service in standing 
out against the movement at a time when temporary 
excitement might easily have persuaded them that the 
tide was going that w-iy. W. H. Johnson.

Reminiscences of a Vice-President.* 



Most readers of Vice-President Stevenson's 
volume will wish, we imagine, that he had held 
himself more strictly to his main title and given 
more fully delineated pictures of the characters 
of local or national interest with whom his long 
legal and political career has brought him into 
contact. In his constant deviations from this 
path he covers much territory already traversed 
by various other writers fairly well known to 
the general reader ; and the result is an inevi- 
table slackening of interest. The story of the 
Mormons in Illinois, the Burr-Hamilton and 
other early American duels, the foundation of 
the Smithsonian Institution, the preaching of 
Peter Cartwright, the Lincoln-Douglas debate, 
and a few other items which might be men- 
tioned, are somewhat tiresome subjects unless 
the writer has wholly new material to produce, 
through personal relation to the events in 
question or through the discovery of hitherto 
unknown sources. 

During the author's early years of profes- 
sional life, the practice of the law in the less 
popidous districts of Illinois still retained some 
of the peculiar backwoods flavor which has 
added so much interest to the story of Lincoln's 
career. The range over which a lawyer might 
be asked to extend his activities is well illus- 
trated by a request which Mr. Stevenson, then 
twenty-two years of age, received from a client 
in a divorce case. The opposite side had secured 
a continuance to the next term of court, and 
Mr. Stevenson's client, the plaintiff, seemed 
deeply disturbed. He asked for a confidential 
interview, during which he stated that he had 
suddenly married the defendant during a fit of 
anger toward an excellent young lady whom he 
had really loved, and for whom his old love had 
returned in full force when it was too late. He 
was duly cautioned against the impropriety of 
allowing anything of this to become known, but 
was assured that he would regain his freedom 
at the next term of court and could then take 
up the broken thread again if he so desired. 
But here came the further dismal revelation 
that another had entered the field, and unless 
he could be held in check all might be lost 
before the divorce was granted. Mr. Stevenson

Papers of a General Nature — Political, Historical, and Retro- 
spective. By Adlai E. Stevenson. Illustrated. Chicago:

assured him that all this was beyond his prov- 
ince ; when the client suddenly hitched his chair 
up close and said : " You are a good-looking 
young fellow, and rather a glib talker, and I '11 
give you this hundred dollars if you'll cut 
that fellow out until I get my divorce." An 
indignant refusal brought the rejoinder, " Why, 
I thought a lawyer would do anything for 
money." 

Among miscellaneous anecdotes of legal prac- 
tice, Mr. Stevenson relates the retort of Curran 
to a judge who is said to have uttered the insult- 
ing taunt, " I could put you in my pocket, sir." 
" If you did," was Curran's reply, " you would 
have more law in your pocket than you ever had 
in your head ! " The author need not have gone 
abroad, for the same kind of retort in still more 
striking form is related of Alexander H. Stephens 
in his contest for a seat in the House of Repre- 
sentatives, in 1843. " I could swallow him 
whole and never know the difference ! "' con- 
temptuously said Judge Walter T. Colquitt, who 
had been called to the stump to check the little 
Georgian's too effective campaign. " Yes, and 
if you did," was the instantaneous retort, " there 
would be more brains in your belly than ever 
will be in your head." We leave it to the 
literary source-monger to determine whether 
Stephens got his idea out of the simple facts of 
the situation, or from Curran, — or, as has been 
suggested, from " Flibbertigibbet " in Kenil- 
worth : " Why, thou little Hop-the-gutter, thou 
art as sharp as vinegar this afternoon ! But tell 
me, how didst thou come off with yonder jolter- 
headed giant whom I left thee with? I was 
afraid he would have stripped thy clothes and 
so swallowed thee, as men peel and eat a roasted 
chestnut." " Had he done so," was the retort, 
" he would have had more brains in his guts 
than ever he had in his noddle." 

As a judge of men, Mr. Stevenson is over- 
charitable. There is scarcely a word of serious 
personal criticism of any contemporary, and we 
find very kindly mention of some whose stand- 
ing at the bar of public opinion has been seri- 
ously shaken. He puts himself down unreserv- 
edly in favor of William J. Bryan as the great- 
est living orator and the most gifted man he has 
ever known. If it be a prerequisite of really 
great oratory to carry conviction, one might 
readily challenge this estimate. It is almost ex- 
clusively by his oratory that Bryan is known to 
his fellow countrymen, and in three great tests 
they have overwhelmingly rejected his advice. 
One can but recall the emphatic assertion of 
Quintilian, " No one pleads worse than the orator

who himself pleases while his case displeases. 
For the source of the pleasure is necessarily aside 
from the case." If " the greatest living orator " 
is one who so signally lacks the power to con- 
vince, then Mr. Stevenson has indeed done well 
to head his chapter " The Lost Art of Oratory." 
His tribute to Cleveland, with whom he was 
associated first as Assistant Postmaster-General 
and later as Vice President, is strong and sin- 
cere . ' ' No incumbent of the Presidency was ever 
less of a time-server than Cleveland. Expediency 
was a word scarcely known to his vocabulary. 
Recognizing alike the dignity and responsibility 
of the great office, he was in the highest degree 
self-reliant. None the less he at all times availed 
himself of the wise counsel of his official advisers. 
In matters falling within their especial province, 
their determination was, except in rare instances, 
conclusive. In no sense was his mind closed 
against the timely counsel of his friends. Far 
from being opinionated, in the offensive sense of 
the word, the ultimate determination, however, 
was after having taken counsel of himself." As 
a guest at his home for some days during the 
campaign of 1892, the author mentions espe- 
cially his quality as a tender and considerate 
husband, a kind and affectionate father. " It 
has never been my good fortune to cross the 
threshold of a more delightful home." And yet 
men with good memories can recall the fact that 
twenty-one years ago political malice stooped 
low enough to try to turn a presidential election 
by circulating all over the country, through 
underground channels, the assertion that Presi- 
dent Cleveland was making his home wretched 
by drunkenness and personal cruelty ! 

It would be easy to fill several pages of The 
Dial with the humorous incidents which the 
author has collected for his readers ; but we 
shall close with a story concerning Thaddeus 
Stevens, told by Mr. Stevenson on the authority 
of James G. Blaine, who related it to him one 
day when passing a certain house on Pennsyl- 
vania Avenue, known as a high-toned gambling 
establishment. Blaine was passing the house 
during his first term in Congress, when Stevens 
emerged from its doors and greeted him. Just 
then a negro preacher stepped up and asked 
Mr. Stevens for a contribution toward a new 
church. Taking a roll of money from his vest 
pocket, he handed a fifty-dollar bill to the 
preacher, and turning to Mr. Blaine solemnly 
observed, 

" God moves in a mysterious way 
His wonders to perform ! "

The Religioxs and Morals of the 
World.* 



Dr. Hastings has won well merited fame as 
a dictionary maker. He plans wisely, marshals 
his forces well, holds himself modestly in the 
background, preserves a juste milieu, and 
pleases his public. His " Dictionary of the 
Bible" (1898-1904) appealed very strongly 
to a large class of modern theologians. It was 
learned, lucid, cautiously critical, and moder- 
ately conservative. While its contributors occu- 
pied very much the same position on Old 
Testament subjects as the scholars who wrote 
for Professor Cheyne's "Encyclopaedia Biblica," 
they did not carry the same methods of critical 
investigation quite as unhesitatingly and regard- 
less of results into the New Testament. This 
corresponded in temper and attitude with the 
prevailing mood in large sections of the church. 
The " Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels," 
a notable work which followed in 1906-1907, 
strengthened the favorable impression. It 
showed the same skill in handling the material, 
and the same ample erudition, while it pre- 
sented the founder of Christianity neither quite 
as a mere man and a prophet of his people, 
subject to the common conditions of human life, 
nor altogether as the incarnate god of ecclesi- 
astical dogma. The one-volume " Dictionary 
of the Bible " (1908) gave further evidence of 
the great ability in this field possessed by the 
editor of " The Expository Times." 

The most original and ambitious enterprise, 
however, that Dr. Hastings has yet undertaken 
is the " Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics," 
of which the first volume now lies before us. 
It will comprise from ten to twelve huge vol- 
umes of about ten thousand pages. According 
to editorial announcement, it will contain arti- 
cles " on every religious belief or custom, on 
every philosophical idea, and every moral prac- 
tice," and also on " such persons and places as 
are famous in the history of religion and mor- 
als." It will " embrace the whole range of the- 
ology and philosophy, together with the relevant 
portions of anthropology, mythology, folk-lore, 
biology, psychology, economics, and sociology." 
Acknowledgments are made to half a hundred 
scholars for their assistance as counsellors. 
Over two hundred appear as authors of articles 
in this volume. Among them are such men as 
Achelis, Bousset, Geffcken, Jacobi, Jeremias,

ever, furnishes the most of them, and they are 
mainly specialists of distinction. Hundreds of 
others will, of course, contribute to the suc- 
ceeding volumes. Surely, everything has been 
done to make this a great encyclopaedia. 

In reading through the three hundred and 
more articles included in this volume, the re- 
viewer has indeed been unable to suppress a 
query whether, in spite of the abundance of 
well-digested information and mature reflection 
offered here, it was really expedient to give so 
large a scope to the work. We were greatly in 
need of an encyclopaedia of religion. The vast 
material brought together, in recent years, by 
the comparative study of religious phenomena, 
was nowhere available to the general public. 
Even good text- books failed to include Chris- 
tianity among the religions of the world, and 
therefore necessarily gave a one-sided and 
wrong idea of the religious development. Pos- 
sibly it would have been a service of more 
immediate value, and more general usefulness, 
if Dr. Hastings had confined himself to a pre- 
sentation, within narrower limits but in a com- 
petent manner and in a proper spirit, of the 
varied expressions of man's religious life. He 
would have found it, even so, sufficiently diffi- 
cult to give an article on " every religious 
belief or custom." 

There can be no question, however, that by 
including ethics and philosophy, geography and 
history, biology and economics, Dr. Hastings 
has been able to place religion in its natural 
setting, as it were, and to make it more intelli- 
gible as an expression of man's life. This 
extension of the scope also justified him in call- 
ing to his assistance experts in various sciences 
and independent thinkers whose statements have 
not passed through the alembic of the theological 
mind. 

In religion, ideas, customs, and institutions 
are important, but the personal element counts 
for most. On the one hand, divine personalities 
— gods, heroes, angels — challenge the religious 
interest; on the other, human personalities, 
prophets, priests, and saints. Such an ency- 
clopaedia as this should be rich in religious 



biography. Every important god should appear 
under his own name. That is not done here. 
One often has to hunt him up in articles deal- 
ing with all sorts of things besides theology. If 
he is discussed at length somewhere, his name 
should appear in its proper place, with an exact 
cross-reference. There seem to be nineteen 
biographical articles. There are three Jews, 
Abravanel, Acosta, and Akiba ; two Arabs, Al 
Jilani, and Abd al Razzak ; one Persian, Arda- 
shir ; classical antiquity supplies six, iEschylus, 
Alexander of Abonoteichos, Alexander the 
Great, Anaxagoras, Apollonius of Tyana, and 
Aristotle ; India two, Ananda and Akbar ; and 
the Christian church five, Abelard, Adelard, 
Ambrose, Anselm, and Aquinas. Amyraut, 
Arius, and Arminius should have had separate 
biographies, and many others discussed inciden- 
tally ought to have been given special articles. 
In the well-written article on Apollonius of 
Tyana, Mr. Canney might have made more of 
the knowledge of India which Damis unmistak- 
ably displays. When a man is known as Alex- 
ander of Abonoteichos, readers naturally like to 
know where that place was. They should have 
been told to look up Inebole on the Black Sea. 
The article on Abyssinia, by Littman, derives 
special freshness and value from the author's 
recent expedition to this country. In reference 
to the Falashas, a view differing from his is 
taken by MacCulloch (article Agaos), who 
denies that they are Jews by descent, and re- 
gards them as proselytes before the introduction 
of Christianity. It is not safe to operate with 
the Pelasgians as Keane does (Aborigines, 
Africa.) Eduard Meyer has shown that they 
were probably only the pre-Hellenic inhabitants 
of Thessaly. Gray rightly concludes that the 
Achaemenians were Mazda-yasnians, not Zo- 
roastrians He might have mentioned that the 
very fact of their being buried in tombs is suffi- 
cient to prove this. Smerdis and Arses should 
not have been left out of the list. History 
cares for facts, not for fictions of legitimacy. 
The theory adopted by Keane (Africa), that 
the Hamito-Semitic stock originated in Africa, 
is of all the most plausible. Paton's article on 
Ammi is a model of its kind, and that on Am- 
monites excellent ; only, there is no evidence 
that " when the rite of child sacrifice was prac- 
ticed in Israel, it was always in the name of 
the Melek " rather than in the name of Yah we, 
nor that Milcom actually demanded such sacri- 
fices. Noldeke treats with his usual mastery 
the religion of the Arabs immediately before 
Muhammad.

In the judgment of Mills, the Ahunaver is a 
hundred years younger than the Gathas ; but 
he does not intimate his present view as to their 
date. Yasna XIX. is not the origin of the 
Philonian Logos, and may be Sasanian. Sbder- 
blom, in his careful article on the Ages of the 
World (Zoroastrian), thinks that the Mazday- 
asnian tradition which places Zarathushtra in 
the seventh century can scarcely have put him 
many centuries too late. Xo key has yet been 
found to the chronology of the A vesta. The 
article on iEgean Religion, by Hogarth, is 
written with sufficient knowledge and fine in- 
sight ; and it is well illustrated. There should 
be such pictorial representations of the gods 
wherever extant monuments supply them. 

The treatment of such movements as Adop- 
tianism. Apollinarianism, Amvraldism, and 
Anabaptism is characterized by objectivity and 
fairness. Mr. Glothlin does not seem to be 
acquainted with the remarkable development of 
the Anabaptist churches in Italy, as shown in 
the published archives of the Inquisition ; nor 
does he do justice to Denck. It is sincerely to 
be hoped that Dr. Hastings may see fit to 
devote a special article to this man of genius 
whose opinions were as far in advance of his 
age as his character shone by contrast with some 
of his better-known contemporaries. McGiffert 
gives a careful summary of the tendencies of 
life in the Apostolic Age. This age he closes 
with the end of the first century. To the present 
writer he seems to crowd the reign of Domitian 
with literary productions that clearly belong to 
the second century. The article on Apologetics 
is itself a curious example of this jeu <T esprit, 
and another interesting specimen of the same 
kind is the article on Apostolic Succession. 

It is a characteristic of this encyclopaedia 
that certain topics are treated from different 
points of view by different writers, or that the 
various phases are assigned to different men. 
Many hands have been at work on such articles 
as those on Adoption, Adultery, Ages of the 
World. Ancestor- Worship, Anointing, Archi- 
tecture, and Art. Special mention should be 
made of the important articles on Mithraic art 
by Cumont. Muhammadan art by Strzygowski, 
Persian art by Jackson, and Christian art by 
Brown. There are a few fine illustrations of 
Christian, Egyptian, and Muhammadan art at 
the end of the volume. One wishes there had 
been more. 

The editorial work deserves the highest 
praise. Disturbing errors are rare. Houtsma's 
Enxykloprrdie des 1*1 am should not be quoted 



" Moh. Encyc" (p. 14). In articles on Mu- 
hammadan subjects, the dates of the Christian 
era should always be given. There is no reason 
why the reader should be obliged to reduce 
dates from one era to another.

A Musical, wizard of the North.* 

We hear a great deal about nationalism in 
music. The Italian melody has played a signifi- 
cant part in the development of the art ; the 
German contrapuntal harmony has shown itself 
to be an investiture for a deeper and larger 
view of life : and now the Russian and the 
Hungarian have made dazzling additions to our 
musical resources. Nor have we by any means 
reached the end. From the rugged North 
comes a contribution well calculated to arouse 
our curiosity and lead us on to admiration. 

Yet it seems easy to make altogether too much 
of nationality. After all, it is hardly the most 
important fact in Wagner's life that he was 
born a Teuton, or in Tchaikovsky's that he was 
born a Slav. So also we consider too curiously 
about genealogies. A great man is truly his 
own ancestor ; he creates his own environment ; 
he finds his followers ; he is the founder of his 
race and fortune. It would seem that too much 
stress has been placed upon local color, so called, 
and the peculiarities indigenous to native music 
everywhere. The composers have made use of 
folk songs and folk dances, but thev have not 
allowed themselves to be fettered by the limita- 
tions inevitably belonging to these. No art has 
been more universal than music. The most 
characteristically national writers have used sub- 
jects that had arisen in lands other than theirs. 
When Schumann and Tchaikovsky each gave 
Byron's " Manfred M a musical setting, perhaps 
a nobler artistic product than the original, local 
color receded into the distance : and Wagner, 
certainly as national as any composer, used 
Norse material in his epoch-making work rather 
than the home-bred version of the great story. 

The national song is really music in the im- 
mature and immediate stage. It springs from 
the life of the people in its youth. It is the 
first natural expression of emotion, and there- 
fore has all the characteristic elements of race 
and locality-. It has the charm and suggestive- 
ness that belong to a limited experience which 
has its realizations before it. which is full of

fears and expectations, and which gives an im- 
aginative hue to the sober facts of the daily 
round. It reflects the skies and the landscape 
that gave it birth ; it has the narrowness and 
the intensity and the superstition of the youth- 
ful and developing consciousness. A reflection 
upon its own processes follows, and this reflec- 
tion means both a loss and a gain. The naive 
melodiousness, the spontaneous reproduction of 
story or feeling, vanishes as if it would never 
return. The processes of the art grow multi- 
form and complex ; they are curious and inge- 
nious structures ; but the fresh charm is there 
no longer. The age of elaborate contrapuntal 
combinations has set in, and the musical edifices 
reared are such that it seems impossible ever to 
surpass them. The whole movement, however, 
leads up to a return of the melodiousness that 
characterized the first stage ; the difference now 
is that the command of the resources of the art 
accompanies the creation of the song. The local 
color and the nationalism are made subservient 
to a larger and a deeper purpose ; absolute 
music becomes a genuine expression of life's 
universal experiences, and takes its place with 
the other arts that have told the great world- 
story to mankind in ways that allure and 
enchant. 

Not all nations have been so gifted as to be 
able to present the faith and aspiration of the 
race in music. The Anglo-Saxon, for some 
reason not here to be inquired into, has appar- 
ently been debarred from this accomplishment. 
The Scandinavian has stepped upon the stage 
later than the others, but he seems to be mak- 
ing good his claim to a place. Gade, Svendsen, 
Sinding, Nordraak, Kjerulf , and above all Ed- 
vard Hagerup Grieg, have entered the charmed 
circle, and are altogether likely to stay there, 
established citizens of the realm. 

Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born at Bergen 
in Norway, on the 15th of June, 1843. His 
family was of importance ; his maternal grand- 
father had been mayor of the city. His father 
was the English consul in Bergen, and on the 
paternal side the family were of Scottish ante- 
cedents, a certain Alexander Greig of Aberdeen 
having left his country for Norway during 
the troublous times of the Stuart Pretender. 
The mother was an accomplished musician, who 
had studied in England and Germany. The 
son remembered particularly her fine perform- 
ance of a Beethoven fantasy with orchestra, at 
a concert in his native city. This mother de- 
termined that her son should be musical, and 
she succeeded beyond her most ardent expecta- 



tions. The young student showed remarkable 
attainment, and when he was twelve years of 
age he brought to school a manuscript with the 
superscription, " Variations on a German Mel- 
ody for the Piano, by Edvard Grieg, Opus 1." 
The teacher, however, with pedagogical astute- 
ness perhaps too common, seemed to take a sin- 
gular offense at such use of the boy's energies. 

At this time the ideas of the youth were not 
definitely turned in the direction of music, but 
he intended to become a minister of the gospel, 
a herald of the truth as he considered it. The 
decisive moment, however, was at hand. One 
day, when Edvard was about fifteen years old, 
the famous violinist, Ole Bull, made a visit to 
the Griegs. He heard the boy play, looked over 
his writings, and on his persuasion it was decided 
to send Edvard to the Conservatory at Leipsic. 
He had the thorough and systematic instruction 
of Richter, of Hauptman, of Reinicke ; but his 
thoughts and imaginings went out toward the 
romanticism of Chopin and Schumann, who 
remained throughout his life strong inspirations 
in his work. He also had help from Moscheles, 
who gave him great encouragement. Sir Arthur 
Sullivan was a fellow-student, and the young 
Norwegian found it necessary to toil long and 
diligently to keep the pace set by his confreres. 

He continued under the influence of Ole Bull, 
and formed a friendship with Richard Nordraak, 
a Norwegian composer, with decided national- 
istic tendencies, who died at the early age of 
twenty-four. He had also made the acquaint- 
ance of Kjerulf, whose songs have the Norse 
accent and flavor. Together these men were 
agreed in giving to their music the form and 
substance which belonged to the picturesque 
peninsula giving them birth. In 1867 Grieg 
married his cousin, Nina Hagerup, and gave con- 
certs with his wife in Christiania, his residence 
for about eight years. The so-called national 
movement in music, however, soon lost the 
interest attending its beginning, and Grieg 
found himself in a war with jealousies and medi- 
ocrities. He gained the adhesion of his coun- 
try's great men ; Bjornson and Ibsen recognized 
in him a kindred spirit. He early attracted the 
attention of Liszt. In December, 1868, the 
famous player wrote him : 

" It gives me great pleasure to tell you of the sincere 
enjoyment I derived from a perusal of your sonata 
(Opus 8 ) . It bears witness to a strong talent for com- 
position, a talent that is reflective, inventive, provided 
with excellent material, and which needs only to follow 
its national inclinations to rise to a high rank. I com- 
fort myself with the belief that you will find in your 
country the success and encouragement you deserve;

nor will you miss them elsewhere; and if you visit 
Germany this winter I invite you cordially to spend 
some time at Weimar that we may become acquainted." 

The praise from Liszt was entirely spontaneous, 
the statement that Grieg had sent to the virtuoso 
some of his compositions being incorrect. After- 
wards, while Grieg was in Rome, the composers 
met ; and in a letter home the Norwegian 
dreamer has this to say : 

"I had fortunately just received the manuscript of 
my pianoforte concerto from Leipsic, and took it with 
me. Besides myself, there were present Winding, 
Sgambati, and a German Lisztite, whose name I do not 
know, but who goes so far in the aping of his idol that 
he even wears the gown of an abbe; add to these a 
Chevalier de Concilium, and some young ladies of the 
kind that would like to eat Liszt, skin, hair, and all; 
their admiration is simply comical. . . . Winding and 
I were very anxious to see if he would really play my 
concerto at sight. I, for my part, considered it impos- 
sible; not so Liszt. ' Will you play ? ' he asked, and I 
made haste to reply, ' No, I cannot.' (You know I have 
never practiced it.) Then Liszt took the manuscript, 
went to the piano, and said to the assembled guests, with 
his characterietic smile, ' Very well, then, I will show 
you also that I cannot.' With that he began. I admit 
that he took the first part of the concerto too fast, and 
the beginning consequently sounded helter-skelter; but 
later on, when I had a chance to indicate the tempo, he 
played as only he can play. ... In conclusion, he 
handed me the manuscript, and said, in a peculiarly 
cordial tone, ' Keep steadily on ; you have the capability, 
and — do not let them intimidate you.' " 

This last admonition Grieg took greatly to 
heart. It encouraged him to pursue the unusual 
tenor of his way ; it led him to make more of the 
peculiar spirit of his country's music ; it gave 
him confidence in the artistic creed which he had 
now clearly formulated, and which became his 
guide during the remainder of his life. He used 
the abundant material of folk-music furnished 
by Norway, as other great composers had done 
before him with folk-music of their lands. He 
took the many peasant songs and dances and 
glorified them. He used them for the delinea- 
tion of national life and traits. As Coleridge 
made a new thing out of the ballads of England 
in his " Ancient Mariner," so Grieg made bal- 
lads and orchestral pieces of remarkable merit 
and novelty out of the peasant melodies of Nor- 
way. His work, of course, was not confined to 
such efforts. He was a free musician of the 
modern type, and his best music belongs to no 
time or country. He lived in the great era of 
Norway's literary activity ; he numbered the 
first men of his time among his friends. He 
has set to music the weird and extraordinary 
story put forth in Ibsen's " Peer Gynt," and he 
began the setting of " Olaf Trygvason " by 
Bjornson, perhaps the noblest subject which 



Norway's history affords. Olaf Trygvason Car- 
ry le declares to be '• still a shining figure for us, 
the wildly beautifullest man in body and soul 
that one has ever heard of in the North." 

Grieg has left compositions of every kind, but 
like his masters, Chopin and Schmann,his power 
is essentially lyric, and his piano pieces, his 
chamber music, and his songs embody the hopes, 
the moods, the aspirations of his time and people 
in exquisite and permanent forms. Norway's 
scenery, her history, her home life, her intense 
absorption in the questions and dreams of the 
modern epoch, are reflected in his music. He 
had the audacities characteristic of his nation 
and period ; but his was a sane and steadfast 
mind, and his work in consequence is uplifting 
and wholesome. 

He spent the greater part of his life in his 
native town or its neighborhood. He won the 
appreciation of his contemporaries ; the German 
Emperor with his usual cordiality did him honor ; 
he conducted his music in other countries be- 
sides his own. He was, unfortunately, an inva- 
lid, and his accomplishment is therefore less 
than it might have been ; although it may, 
through these apparent misfortunes, have gained 
in refinement and sympathy. When the good 
fight was ended, he received generously the 
recognition that belongs to one who has done 
valiant service and added to the joy and eleva- 
tion of his fellow men. 

The present edition of Mr. Henry T. Finck's 
book on " Grieg and his Music " is almost a 
new work. It presents much additional mate- 
rial. It contains a number of letters from the 
composer to the author. It is an enthusiastic 
discussion of Grieg's place among musicians ; 
it is written in the writer's entertaining man- 
ner ; it is thorough and conscientious. We may 
not agree with Mr. Finck in all the claims he 
makes for his hero, but his arguments are cal- 
culated to convince. He makes one statement 
which we cannot help quoting : 

"If I am to be called uncritical because of my 
abounding enthusiasm for the best products of Grieg's 
genius, uncritical let me be called. The older I get the 
more I become convinced that the alleged • critical ' 
faculty of our times is a mental disease, a species of 
phylloxera threatening the best works of genius. Let 
us enjoy the fresh grapes from which the harmless wine 
of musical intoxication is made, leaving the raisins to 
the analysis and the critical commentators. Grieg's 
music is as fresh and inspiriting as on the day when it 
was composed; most of it is music of the future." 

Mr. Finck evidently believes in the apprecia- 
tion as distinguished from the criticism ; and 
in this we think he is right. He has given the

Mesmerism and Christian Science.* 

The connection of the two systems incorpor- 
ated in the title of Mr. Podmore's book, " Mes- 
merism and Christian Science," is justified in 
the sub-title," A Short History of Mental Heal- 
ing"'; and it is as an admirable historical con- 
tribution that the work will find its place. In 
deed, the account of the life of Mesmer and of 
the further vicissitudes of his system maintains 
so admirable a perspective that it may well be 
regarded as the most reliable accessible history 
of the subject. It is a curious aspect of Mes- 
mer's own view of the phenomena which he so 
inadvertently aroused, that the very details 
which he ignored, and which in turn were set 
aside by several of the examining commissions 
(for whom " imagination " was an adequate 
explanation for the whole range of their obser- 
vations,) are the very ones which proved histori- 
cally influential and scientifically significant. 
In the first place, the discovery that the subjects 
upon whom Mesmer exercised his " magnetic " 
influence were really in an abnormal mental 
state, fell to one of his successors ; and then, 
when a rational interpretation seemed inevitable, 
the development of affairs was distorted by the 
discovery that the " somnambules " (as they 
were then termed) had supersensitive powers, 
could read their own and others' physiologies, 
and by this method practise a new variety of 
mental healing. 

Here too lies the bond of connection between 
the " mesmerists " and the " spiritualists '; for 
the " sensitives " of the former became the 
" mediums " of the latter, while the doctrine of 
a magnetic fluid or radiation was once more 
revived in the theories of Reichenbach. The 
spiritualistic interest soon absorbed the thera- 
peutic ; and the demonstration of occult and 
transcendent powers seemed alone adequate to 
prove either the reality of the hypnotic state or 
the truth of the theories to which the observa- 
tions gave rise. With the reinstatement of the 
hypnotic phenomena on a rational basis, hypnotic

suggestions were again utilized for curative pur- 
poses ; and in this practice the demonstration of 
the dominant importance of suggestion became 
the central and the most valuable result. With 
this recognition, " mental healing *' as a psycho- 
logical procedure was justified alike in theory 
and practice ; and with the growth of experience, 
the large role of suggestive measures as applied 
to normal individuals in the normal state was 
overwhelmingly established. 

The last stage in the development was to 
formulate these principles, and, as it happened, 
to give them a pronounced religious setting. 
With this movement once inaugurated, the trend 
of its development proved to be largely deter- 
mined by the personality and the methods of its 
leader, Mrs. Eddy. The peculiarities of her be- 
lief and the astounding scope of her influence do 
not loom as large in the critical historian's per- 
spective as they did in the actual unfoldment of 
the spectacular drama which we of this genera- 
tion have had the privilege of witnessing. It is 
curious that among these notions is a violent 
antipathy to " animal magnetism," which Mrs. 
Eddy regards as the incarnation of as much of 
evil as her system permits her to recognize. Yet 
throughout this story, with its many ramifica- 
tions, the demonstration of the actual cures 
effected remains the positive support of each 
theory in turn ; so that Mr. Podmore is justified 
in holding together the diverse strands of his his- 
tory by the common interest in mental healing. 

Mr. Podmore is already favorably known as 
the historian of modern spiritualism and as the 
author of several works bearing upon psychical 
research. Though he is inclined to admit the 
possibility (if not the actual demonstration) of 
supersensuous forms of psychical manifestation, 
he is both cautious and critical in his admis- 
sions, and with a few exceptions — which, how- 
ever, are to be regretted — he does not allow 
his personal view to detract from the objective 
presentation of his material.

"A Still, Strong Man."* 



One of the striking contrasts of our political 
history is that between Grover Cleveland as he 
appeared in 1884^ — especially to the Republi- 
cans, brought up in fear of the very thought of 
Democratic rule in national affairs, — and the 
Grover Cleveland portrayed in Mr. Parker's 
" Recollections." The writer well remembers

how, though he had been nurtured on " The 
Nation," and had no fear of independent voting, 
and determined as he was not to vote for Blaine, 
he could yet not bring himself to vote for the ob- 
scure man against whom scandalous charges had 
been brought, and who seemed to have little to 
recommend him to the confidence of the country 
for the supreme gift of the people. Good men 
trembled when the returns came in, showing that 
Cleveland had been elected, fearing that the un- 
skilled pilot would rim the ship on the rocks, 
that the results of the Civil War would be lost. 

These fears seem childish, now that we have 
come to know that masterful pilot, his sturdy 
patriotism, his lofty ideals, his steadiness in 
action, his great ability ; but they were very real 
then. One of the greatest of Grover Cleveland's 
many services to the country was his clearing 
away forever of the conviction, held by number- 
less conscientious Republicans, that the Demo- 
crats would not be loyal to the settlement of the 
great struggle between the North and the South, 
that they could not be trusted with the control 
of the government. When his administration 
had manifested its fine temper, that bogey was 
destroyed, and the two parties could meet on 
equal terms as contestants for power. 

Mr. Parker's book is not intended as a formal 
biography, but it answers every purpose of a 
biography from the political side, and it presents 
the real Grover Cleveland with great skill. The 
author was thrown into close relations with 
President Cleveland during his first administra- 
tion, and was depended on by him until his death 
as adviser, as the medium for communicating 
with the public, as energetic and skilful in doing 
what Mr. Cleveland himself could not do in gain- 
ing newspaper cooperation and support for the 
government. He thus held Mr. Cleveland's con- 
fidence for the rest of his life, and from the 
intimacy thus maintained he is able to show us 
the real man as perhaps no other living person 
could. 

The early history of Mr. Cleveland is given 
briefly but sufficiently. His struggles were 
those of many a poor clergyman's son, the one 
disappointment having been his inability to 
secure a college education on account of the 
burden resting upon him of supporting his 
mother and sisters. The same cause kept him 
from enlisting in the army ; his two brothers 
went as soldiers, and he burdened himself with 
debt for many years to furnish a substitute for 
himself. His rise to publie confidence and pro- 
fessional success in Buffalo, and his phenomenal 
victory in New York as candidate for the gov- 



ernorship, though almost unknown to the people 
of the State, are described with sufficient fulness. 

President Cleveland never, when in active 
political life, quite gained popularity with the 
people. He was very reserved, very much op- 
posed to any line of conduct that might look as 
if he were trying to gain popular favor, too 
sturdily independent to bend to popular demands, 
too sensitive in political and personal honor to 
use office or influence to advance his own inter- 
ests or those of his friends. Many instances of 
this are given, from which we select a charac- 
teristic one. 

" One day during the last winter of his life, when in 
one of his reminiscent moods, he surprised me by saying, 
' Parker, it has always been said that it was something 
of a drawback to a man, if he wanted anything, to have 
been one of my friends; and I guess that in some respects 
this judgment was about right.' Continuing, he ex- 
plained : ' I simply could not bring myself to the point 
of using the public service, or of being open to the charge 
of using it, for personal ends. It would, however, be 
unjust to accuse me of discriminating against my friends, 
as my record shows; but I would rather, a thousand 
times, go to my grave with the reputation I have gained 
in this respect than to have had anybody say with truth 
that I had used official patronage for the payment of 
private debts." 

Differing in feeling and practice from some men 
of high position, he insisted that his parlor and 
his table were his own, and declined to use them 
for furthering political plans or interests. 

That Mr. Cleveland possessed personal qual- 
ities which endeared him to all who were brought 
into friendly contact with him, comes as some- 
thing of a surprise to those who knew only of 
his rugged honesty and his violent controversies 
with Congress and with many of the leaders of 
his party. Probably no other president has 
ever bound so closely to himself the men whom 
he chose as members of his cabinet. Every 
man of them remained his intimate personal 
friend until death. There seems to have been 
a charm in his simple manhood and his sym- 
pathetic nature that won all who came within 
the circle of personal relations with him. And 
as different as was the man Cleveland from the 
austere self-contained President, so different 
was the ponderous literary style of his public 
documents from his playful and self-revealing 
letters to his friends. 

Among the portions of the book most valu- 
able to the student of history is that which 
gives the inside story of the activities of Cleve- 
land's friends to make him the candidate of his 
party in 1892. Rarely are the details of any 
important campaign given as frankly as these 
are given by Mr. Parker ; and rarely is there

a campaign in which there is so little for the 
most high-minded to be ashamed of. The whole 
management was highly creditable to Mr. 
Cleveland and to his friends, and is very inter- 
esting as a revelation of character as well as of 
the methods of political campaigning. Equally 
interesting is the story of Mr. Cleveland's 
selection of his cabinet officers and leading offi- 
cials ; of the famous Venezuela message which 
came so dangerously near involving us in a 
war with England, and is regarded by many 
of Cleveland's admirers as his greatest official 
mistake ; of his attitude towards those in his 
own party who were pursuing the false gods of 
free silver and populism. All is told in a 
straightforward way that carries conviction. 
Much as Grover Cleveland has come to be ad- 
mired as one of our best presidents, this book 
will increase admiration for him both as presi- 
dent and as man. Charles H. Cooper. 



Recent Fiction.* 



Mr. De Morgan's new novel (his fourth) is en- 
titled " It Never Can Happen Again," which gives 
an easy cue to the reviewer. He has only to say 
" Let us hope that it can," or " See that it does n't," 
according as his opinion is favorable or unfavorable, 
and there is a whole judgment in a nutshell. For 
our own part, we should unhesitatingly employ the 
former phrase, as a feeble expression of gratitude 
for these seven hundred pages of ingenious inven- 
tion, stamped with the truly creative mark as far as 
character is concerned, replete with the humor that 
lights up the depths of life, and rich with the fruits 
of a ripened intelligence brought to bear upon a 
wide range of human concerns. Mr. De Morgan's 
new novel is his longest ; if it is not quite his best, 
it is so good that we shall not seem ungrateful by 
engaging in any invidious comparisons. One of the

pensity to quips of thought and paradox, as it is 
called, misleads you and spoils your talk." This 
might be made the text of an adverse criticism, for 
few books are so largely made up of "quips of 
thought " as are those of this writer, but at the worst 
they are no more than the exhibition of a mannerism 
which cannot obscure the deep human sympathies 
underneath, and which, although it demands from 
the reader perpetual agility, never fails to justify 
itself as essential to the texture of the narrative. As 
in two of its predecessors, the opening gambit of 
the new novel is a series of moves taken by a child 
in the London slums and the child's more or less 
disreputable relatives and associates. In this case 
the child is a girl named Lizerann, not "for short," 
like Alice, but by way of phonetic transcription. She 
is a brave little thing of seven, speaking a dialect 
which is accurately reproduced, and lavishing a 
wealth of affection upon her " daddy," who once 
sailed the seas, and is now a blind beggar. Even 
this calamity does not spare him from the buffets of 
fate, for presently he is run over by a carter's wagon 
and taken to the hospital with crushed limbs. Indi- 
rectly, this disaster is the means of bringing kindly 
protection to both father and child, and of surround- 
ing their remaining days with a tenderness that 
softens the intolerable pathos of their close. For in 
the end a motor-car gets what is left of this father's 
life, and the child dies a victim of tuberculosis. We 
soon realize that she is not to grow up and provide 
the story with a heroine, as Alice did, but that the 
leading interest is to be created about a group of 
quite different people. These people, whom we 
first meet at a country house, include among their 
number the stately daugter of the family, Judith 
Murgatroyd, and Alfred Challis, a successful novelist 
and playwright. There are several other figures of 
interest, besides chits and bores, but these two, 
together with the author's wife (who is not of the 
party, and reputed to be impossible) are the chief 
characters of the novel. Judith, who is a vain and 
selfish creature, exerts her arts upon Alfred and 
fascinates a part of his nature, while the other and 
better part of it remains loyal to his own bourgeois 
establishment. On the other hand, the wife nurses 
a few sparks of pique at her husband's fancied 
neglect into a flame of resentment, fanned to fury 
by her own misconstruction of trivial happenings, 
and by the over-candid sympathies of a prurient 
gossip of whom she makes a confidant. Things get 
worse and worse between husband and wife, until 
the latter takes refuge with her mother, and the 
former is fairly driven into a passion for Judith the 
temptress. When the crisis approaches, Alfred and 
Judith are just about to carry out a plan of elope- 
ment and marriage, and the very motor-car which 
is carrying them away runs over the blind beggar 
and knocks Alfred into an unconsciousness which 
lasts for several days. But how, the perplexed 
reader will ask at this point, how could Alfred plan 
marriage with another woman when he already had 
a wife ? Thereby hangs the whole of Mr. De

Morgan's tale, which is a complicated and whimsi- 
cal illustration of the English law prohibiting mar- 
riage with a deceased wife's sister. Alfred's wife 
i> this sort of a wife ; and when she deserts him she 
takes the position that their marriage has never been 
legal, and upon this theory she defies him to claim 
possession of their children. Now these happenings 
are so timed that the climax is reached just when 
the House of Lords is on the point of relaxing in its 
stubborn opposition, and of legalizing such marriages 
retrospectively as well as for the future. When 
Alfred is speeding away in the motor-car with Judith, 
their haste is due to the fact that unless they are 
married at once the action of the Lords, now assured, 
will confirm the legal character of Alfred's previous 
marriage and make his wife and children legitimate. 
So the chauffeur whose reckless driving checks the 
escapade proves to be a dens ex machind in the 
literal sense. There are still other complications, 
wheels within wheels, involving the intricacy of the 
marriage laws, at which the author pokes all sorts 
of satirical fun ; but we should despair of describing 
them with any degree of brevity. Suffice it to say 
that the wife relents when she hears of her husband's 
accident, and the domestic bond, so nearly snapped, 
is restored in full strength. The title of the novel 
is now explained, for such a case as is here described 
is no longer possible under English law. The author 
appends to his tale an interesting note from which 
we make the following quotation : 

'• When, to my great surprise, I published four years since 
a novel called ' Joseph Vance," a statement was repeated 
more than once in some journals that were kind enough to 
notice it. that its author was seventy years of age. Why 
this made me feel like a centenarian I do not know, espe- 
cially as it was ahead of the facts. But that was its moral 
effect. Its practical one was to make me endeavor to set it 
right. ... Li the course of my attempts to procure the 
reduction to which I was entitled, I expressed a hope that 
the said author would live to be seventy, and. further, that 
he would write four or five volumes as long as his first in 
the interim." 

The hope has now been fulfilled, for the author 
has just passed his seventieth birthday. Our own 
hope is that he may become a centenarian in fact 
as well as in moral feeling, attaching to it only the 
condition that no year of the coming thirty may be 
without its book. 

" The Men of the Mountain," Mr. S. R. Crockett's 
latest tale, is unexpectedly compact and vivid in 
quality, besides being concerned with a theme quite 
different from those previously chosen by this fertile 
writer. It is a tale of the Franco-Prussian War, 
not handled, however, in the conventionally theat- 
rical manner, but having a real basis of life, and 
presenting an aspect of the struggle almost unknown 
to the average reader. No battles are described and 
no political crises are exploited, but we are instead 
given an intimate account of what the disorders of 
the Terrible Year meant to the simple folk of the 
Jura and the adjacent Swiss border. The smuggling, 
the raiding, the sharpshooting, and the general 
lawlessness of this region are brought home to us in 
a series of vivid episodes, all centring about a 



Genevan minister (with an Edinburgh schooling in 
divinity), who is a true pastor of his scattered flock, 
and whose simple God-fearing life commands the 
tribute of our respect By way of contrast, we have 
a German military chaplain, whose rough humor 
and masterful bearing offer unfailing entertainment. 
A pair of heroines are provided ; one of them is the 
minister's sister, the other is a country school mis- 
tress who turns out to be an heiress. There is also 
a villain, who promises well at first, but is after- 
wards spoiled by an attack of repentance. This 
seems to us rather a mean trick. But the author 
has, on the whole, done better in this book than in 
most of his others, and we must not be too severe 
upon his indulgence in the sentimental. 

The stories of the Canadian Northwest which 
Mr. Harold Bindloss writes with such frequency 
and ease are so palpably similar that we sometimes 
wonder how they can continue so to hold our inter- 
est. For interesting they are, even to the newest of 
them, "The Greater Power," which is the veriest 
replica of its predecessors. Here again is the hero 
who wrests victory from defeat in the struggle with 
nature, and wins a woman's love by sheer deter- 
mination and an exhibition of the qualities of simple 
manhood. The scene is British Columbia, the task 
accomplished is the reclamation of a mountain val- 
ley by a daring work of engineering, and the enemy 
overcome is a knot of unscrupulous speculators in 
land. It makes a varied and virile tale no less de- 
serving of praise than the half dozen of its sort that 
have come before. 

There is good romantic stuff in " The Castle by 
the Sea," which is the latest invention of Mr. H. B. 
Marriott Watson. A Londoner, seeking a quiet 
place for literary work, rents a castle on the Devon 
coast for the summer. The owner is supposed to be 
in foreign parts, but in reality is hiding in and about 
the castle, a subject of anxious pursuit on the part 
of sundry creditors. His tenant finds anything but 
the peace he had looked for in his new quarters, for 
mysterious hangers-about and weird nocturnal dis- 
turbances engage his attention from the start, and 
the pursuit of letters languishes. Ghostly walkings 
or burglarious visitations seem to be the alternative 
theories upon which to account for the disturbances 
which vex his nights and perplex his waking hours. 
Presently he identifies his landlord, sympathizes with 
his difficulties, and harbors him in secret. For some 
reason, the creditors seem to have an inordinate de- 
sire to gain possession of the property, and their 
motive is at last revealed when the fact transpires 
that the estate has valuable deposits of copper. The 
mystery is skilfully worked up until the close, when 
the conspirators are thwarted, and Sir Gilbert comes 
into his own. There are several interesting ladies, 
summer visitors in the neighborhood, and one of 
them is charming enough to be quite adequate as a 
horoine, and to supply the sentimental interest which 
the reader naturally expects. Mr. Watson's style is 
as good as his invention, and the sum total of the 
effect is decidedly pleasing.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Mr. Thomas Nelson Page has become a victim 
of the Zeitgeist, and has deserted his chosen field 
of Southern romance to plunge into the welter of 
industrial and political life as it exists in the 
American city of to-day. We cannot say that his 
move has been ill-advised, for he has produced a 
thoroughly readable novel, albeit one that exhibits 
several loose ends, and is rather disjointed in con- 
struction. But he has become sufficiently familiar 
of late years with the problems of city life to discuss 
them intelligently, and he brings wholesome moral 
sympathies together with a fine indignation to bear 
upon their treatment. His city is not named, but 
his descriptions point with some closeness to Chicago, 
and the conditions he describes are chiefly related 
to the labor question in connection with the traction 
companies, and to the corrupt alliance of politics 
with vice. His types are fairly familiar, including 
the good magnate and the bad one, the walking 
delegate, the corporation lawyer, the political boss, 
the sycophantic churchman, the worldly woman of 
society whose luxury comes from grinding the faces 
of the poor, the settlement worker, and the idealist 
(a Jew), who becomes the martyr of the people's 
cause. We have also, of course, the magnate's 
daughter for a heroine and the earnest young 
reformer for a hero, both of which figures are more 
humanly natural than is usually the case. Mr. Page 
steers clear of melodrama, and does not force the 
note of conflict between duty and affection. Nor 
does he outrage all the probabilities by resorting to 
bathos at the close and making the wicked suffer a 
change of heart. His hero is a rather commonplace 
person whom we like all the better for not indulging 
in heroics; while John Marvel, the Christian 
preacher, is hardly made prominent enough to jus- 
tify the use of his name for a title. 

When we first make the acquaintance of Martin 
Eden, who is the latest embodiment of Mr. Jack 
London's conception of manly character and the 
latest projection of his notions about society in par- 
ticular and the universe in general, his command of 
speech is somewhat circumscribed. M Excuse me, 
Miss, fer buttin' in that way. I guess the real facts 
is that I don't know nothing much about such things. 
It ain't in my class." This is not surprising, because 
Martin, who is twenty-one, has hitherto associated 
chiefly with sailors and hoodlums. But it is a trifle 
surprising to find, a few weeks later, that his speech 
has taken on such a fashion as this : " Beauty has 
significance, but I never knew its significance before. 
I just accepted beauty as something meaningless, or 
something that was just beautiful without rhyme or 
reason. I did not know anything about beauty. 
But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to 
know. This grass is more beautiful to me now that 
I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry 
of sun and rain that makes it become grass." The 
cause of this quick metamorphosis is a girl, combined 
with a series of attacks upon the public library, and 
readings that range from Madame Blavatsky to 
Herbert Spencer. Having realized that there is a 



higher life than that of the hoodlum, he aims to 
attain it by way of authorship. He scribbles assidu- 
ously, refuses the opportunities for honest toil that 
his well-wishers provide, starves himself to pay the 
postage on his manuscripts, and finds, with an 
amazement that deepens into bitterness, that they 
come back to him in a monotonous procession. 
Whereupon he delivers himself of sundry diatribes 
against the sickly culture that editors and publishers 
seem leagued to promote. Finally, the tide turns, 
his wares find a market, and he rolls in wealth. But 
the girl who had been the vitalizing influence in his 
life is by this time scorned as a product of the 
stupefying educational mill and an embodiment of 
the bourgeoisie. He has read Nietzsche, and found 
in himself the traits of the superman. He is also 
by way of being a contradictory blend of socialist and 
anarchist. Spurning the maiden whose eyes are at 
last opened to his true greatness, scorning the clamor- 
ous publisher who now waylays him at every turn, 
despising the trade which has brought him worldly 
fortune, he writes no more, but cannily unloads all 
his juvenile effusions upon the market, distributes 
largess to the humble companions of his time of ad- 
versity, and then takes passage for the islands of the 
Pacific. But even the dream of a Tabitian paradise 
palls upon him after a few days of the voyage, and 
he ends the whole miserable business of life by drop- 
ping out of the port-hole one dark night. It is just 
as well. Such turbulent egotism as his could never 
find any real satisfaction in existence, and such de- 
fiance of the collective wisdom of mankind could not 
contribute to society anything of value. It is unfor- 
tunate that Mr. London could not invest his hero 
with the attributes that awaken sympathy, so that 
we might at least mourn the abrupt termination of 
his career. As it is, the author merely satisfies our 
curiosity, and leaves us wondering at the perverted 
idealism which makes havoc of Martin's ambitions. 
And there is not a little satisfaction in knowing that 
he is not to live to make miserable the heroine, who 
is, despite Martin's (and the author's) scorn of her, 
a sensible and attractive young woman, far more 
worth while than the man who has outgrown her in 
his own conceit. 

In one respect, u The Hungry Heart," by Mr. 
David Graham Phillips, is a resetting of the old 
" triangular " situation that has been done to death 
by hordes of modern novelists. More seriously, it 
is a protest, after the fashion of " A Doll Home," 
against the convention that considers a woman a 
mere plaything for some man, to be indulged in her 
whims, but never to be admitted into intelligent 
companionship. Unfortunately, Mr. Phillips, who 
can write verbosely and expound a thesis with a good 
deal of vehemence, cannot shape consistent charac- 
ters, and cannot avoid the pitfalls of vulgai'ity and 
sensationalism. He keeps our sympathies constantly 
shifting. At first they are with the neglected wife, 
and the husband deserves only indignatiou. Then 
the lover appears, and for a time shines in so white 
a light that we are almost made to condone the wife's

faithlessness. But presently we have to revise our 
judgments all round, for the lover is transformed 
into a despicable creature, the husband into a patient 
heroic soul worthy of anybody's love, and the wife 
into a rather shrewish person of unstable purpose 
and violent passions. When the forbidden fruit 
upon which her " hungry heart " is fed turns to dust 
and ashes in her mouth, she looks longingly at the 
substantial fare she has scorned, and is glad to 
return to it at the request of her wronged but com- 
placent husband. The element of vulgarity is not 
missing from the story, but it is less grossly repellant 
than in some of the novels that Mr. Phillips has pre- 
viouslv published. But he still nurses his old griev- 
ance against the refinements of civilized society, and 
the weapon of his warfare is a weaver's beam. 

When "The Autobiography of Nicholas Worth " 
was appearing serially in " The Atlantic Monthly," 
we took it at its face value as a truthful record of 
personal experience. Now. to our considerable sur- 
prise, it is called " The Southerner," and published 
as a novel. This change of style, however, does not 
seem to call for any radical readjustment of our atti- 
tude toward the book, for. whether its tale be actu- 
ally true or not, the spirit of truth is in the narrative 
from beginning to end, and the fine idealism which 
inspires it is just what it was before. It is the life- 
history of a man of the South, to whom the Civil 
War is no more than a memory of childhood, and 
whose manhood energy has been devoted to the 
building up of a new civilization upon the ruins of 
the old. He looks hopefully to the future, not re- 
gretfully toward the past, and he realizes that the 
tradition of the old days, demanding that deference 
be paid to the sentiments and prejudices of a van- 
ishing generation, is the chief obstacle in the path 
of progress. He encounters this obstacle, embodied 
in the politicians and •• colonels " of the old regime, 
at every stage of his career : and it causes him many 
a disheartening set-back. But his faith i? strong, 
and his patience adequate, and he sees the new or- 
der gradually unfolding in politics, industry, and 
education. The story of this man's struggle for the 
betterment of his fellows, whether it be pieced to- 
gether by fancy, or be literally the record of expe- 
rience, makes one of the most genuine of books ; it 
combines sincerity with insight, and deserves to be 
taken to heart by serious readers both North and 
South. 

Jason sought the golden fleece, and succumbed 
to the charms of Medea : the modern •* Jason " of 
Mr. Justus Miles Forman's romance undertook the 
chivalrous quest of tracking a boy who had been 
kidnapped in Paris, and found his fate in the young 
woman who was responsible for the boy's detention. 
This was not altogether nice of Jason, whose real 
name was Sainte-Marie. because the adventure was 
embarked upon for the sake of the beaux yeux of 
the boy's sister, and what he should have done was 
to return successful and claim his reward. On the 
other hand, the boy was not exactly kidnapped, 
because he had been deceived by his uncle (a wily 



villain) into believing that his family were angry 
with him, and was the willing guest of Medea, the 
object of his calf-love. The enchantress was herself 
a nicer girl than one might imagine, and her chief 
misfortune was her father, who was a shady adven- 
turer. This is the complication set forth in Mr. 
Forman's story, which is ingeniously contrived and 
vivaciously related. It is an intensely Parisian 
story, written by one who knows intimately and 
loves deeply the cheerful City of Light. 

Historical novels about Cromwell are apt to be 
interesting, and, although their name is legion, we 
have taken up " Big John Baldwin," by Mr. Wilson 
Vance, with pleasurable anticipations that have not 
been disappointed. The story is in the journal 
form, as written from time to time by its hero, who 
is a sort of John Ridd of the Fen country. He is 
huge of build, masterful of disposition, and always 
lovable. He is pig-headed enough to refuse the 
king's favors, and to defy Cromwell. Especially in 
the matter of the Irish massacres, he is plain 
spoken in his speech with the Lord General, and 
thwarts him in an attempt to capture Prince Rupert 
by treachery. The heroine twists him about her 
fingers, and teases him to the top of her bent; but 
this particular agony is not unduly prolonged, and 
her maiden heart is irrevokably yielded up to him 
midway in the narrative. After the Protectorate is 
firmly established, the hero, wearying of wars, seeks 
a home in Virginia, whither he removes with house- 
hold and retainers, establishing a manorial estate 
upon the upper Potomac. In the fulness of time, 
some thirty years later, he dies leaving the long- 
winded but not unreadable journal for the instruc- 
tion of his descendants. Mr. Vance has copied the 
conventional pattern of Roundhead style with fair 
success, and invested his book with something of 
the garb of its period.

the superficial likeness in being French, have beneath 
all their disparity the essential agreement of a 
skeptical attitude toward life. Their negations were 
of different kinds. Fabre was a priest who saw 
through the shams of his profession ; Fontenelle, 
cynical in everything else, foil in love with the

scientific truth which later was to obsess modern 
thinking; Huysman's rebound into the Catholic 
faith came after he had run the gamut of the world's 
pleasures and found them dust and ashes. Me'rime'e 
was the man of the world utterly weary of the 
shows thereof ; while Maeterlinck, like Huysman, 
found relief in his maturity from the haunting fatal- 
ism of his earlier plays in a kind of Emersonian 
idealism. And Anatole France remains a master of 
that exquisite irony which bites, yet is lightened by 
art, sympathy, and charm of style. Unlike as the 
six are, they are of the fellowship of Doubt, each in 
his respective day and generation. They are thus 
symptomatic, and so properly grouped. The final 
summary of the modern philosophic pose is keen 
and wise, and the book as a whole has a literary 
quality unusual in works of its kind, which makes 
it agreeable reading ; its theme assures stimulation, 
for there is something fascinating about men who, 
even when they interpret humanity in terms of 
pessimism, unite persuasive eloquence of expression 
with intellectual power. True beacons they may 
not be ; but they shed light in their own fashion, if 
only to warn us away from the rocks of casuistry 
and the treacherous waters of hypercriticism. 



A London haunt Takin S advantage of the issue of a 
and its literary second edition of his learnedly anti- 
associatwns. quarian work on " The Literary His- 
tory of the Adelphi and its Neighborhood" (Duffield) 
Mr. Austin Brereton adds a few interesting particu- 
lars and writes a new Introduction. The name 
" Adelphi " seems to have been applied since 1772 to 
a block of buildings erected by the brothers Robert 
and James Adam, famous architects of their time, 
who signed their architectural drawings with this 
Greek word meaning " brothers." The rambling edi- 
fice in question stands on the bank of the Thames, 
between the Strand and the river, not far from Char- 
ing Cross. Mr. Brereton has delved into the ancient 
history of this spot, and even has the hardihood to 
ask the reader to accompany him back to the thir- 
teenth century, when Durham House, town residence 
of the Bishop of Durham, stood on the ground now 
covered by the Adelphi. With incredible industry 
he has brought together a multitude of historic and 
literary references to the locality, succeeding even in 
knitting connection between it and Shakespeare, to 
say nothing of Dickens, Hood, Lamb, Hazlitt, 
De Quincey, Garrick, Goldsmith, Johnson, Pepys, 
and a host of others — a very pretty exercise in lit- 
erary research, and furnishing opportunity (if de- 
sired) for any number of enlarged and emended 
editions of one's book. Incidentally, Mr. Brereton 
compliments us Americans on our acquaintance with 
the lore of old London streets, while he refers to the 
Londoners as knowing nothing about their own city. 
One wishes that he had made it a little clearer ex- 
actly what is at present designated by the name 
Adelphi ; for its application appears loose and elas- 
tic. The fact that the author himself lives at " 3 



Men and 
manners of 
old Florence. 



Adam Street, Adelphi, W. C," may help to explain 
his eager interest in this particular neighborhood. 
The book has many illustrations from old prints and 

other sources. 

Whether Dr. Guido Biagi writes in 
his native Italian or in English, he is 
master of a fine literary style, and is 
sure to be engaging. Moreover, as librarian of two 
of the oldest collections of books in Florence, he has 
access to a large amount of rare material. He un- 
derstands how to ransack among old books and 
parchments, among dusty archives and forgotten 
records, and to extract from them all sorts of choice 
bits in a way to make them appeal to the imagina- 
tion. Therefore his latest book, " Men and Manners of 
Old Florence" (McClurg),is not only a highly inform- 
ing work but a highly entertaining one. Although not 
a connected narrative, its five essays deal with sub- 
jects that give us more than passing glimpses into 
Florentine life at its most interesting period — the 
six centuries between the thirteenth and the nine- 
teenth. From one chapter, we learn something of 
the life of the early Italian merchants, before they 
had won fortunes, and while they were still laboring in 
their shops and warehouses, striving for the achieve- 
ment of riches and nobility for their families. Even 
in those primitive days, we find abundant evidence 
of that natural courtesy and love of refinement and 
beauty which led those early merchants to spend the 
first money they could spare upon the beautifying of 
their houses and gardens, the collecting and order- 
ing for pure love of art, of pictures and illuminations 
and manuscripts, thus forming the nucleus of many 
a famous library or gallery of art. In another chap- 
ter we have an alluring picture of that easy mirthful 
life, that dazzling splendor of art and poetry, that 
thoughtless gaiety which is summed up in the word 
Renaissance. In another essay, the longest of all, 
we are given the life-story of a woman who was a 
famous beauty and a poet of some merit in her day, 
a woman who figured under her own or fictitious 
names as the heroine of countless songs, tales, and 
sonnets — Tullia of Aragon. Dr. Biagi explains 
the position of Tullia, and of others of her class, by 
the somewhat surprising statement that " Intelligent 
sympathy was rarely looked for in the family, for 
the housewife of this time was either a fear-inspiring 
virago with a masculine mind, capable of protecting 
her virtue by sheer force of arms, or else she was a 
creature wholly absorbed in domestic matters, with 
no understanding for anything beyond her prayers 
and her pantry. Thus men of letters, who sought 
for charm of mind, for a beauty less austere, who 
wanted a Muse for their verses and a companion for 
their merry feastings, turned to the trained and ac- 
complished courtesans, regarding them somewhat as 
one regards a fair flower whose scent and beauty 
one enjoys without inquiring how and where it was 
grown." The forty-nine illustrations of the book are 
of unusual excellence, many of them having never 
been published before.

Darwin's most hshed in the " .Life and .Letters, 
famous book. occurs this passage : u In June 1842 
I first allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a 
very brief abstract of my theory in pencil in 35 
pages ; and this was enlarged during the summer of 
1844 into one of 230 pages, which I had fairly 
copied out and still possess." These two abstracts, 
one of 1842 and the other of 1844, are now printed 
together as u The Foundation of the Origin of 
Species " (Putnam). The essays are edited and an 
introduction is furnished by Francis Darwin. The 
1842 essay is in Darwin's most elliptical style; in 
many places it is absolutely unintelligible, and must 
always have been so to anyone but the writer. It 
clearly is simply a worker's outline notes, preliminary 
to a careful setting forth of the subject. The very 
careful and thorough editing which it receives can 
make it no more than this. It is interesting chiefly 
for two reasons : one, because the outline is Dar- 
win's — we see how the master worked ; the other, 
because it, in connection with the 1844 essay, shows 
how his ideas changed and developed in the twenty 
years from 1839 when he read Malthus to 1859 
when the " Origin " appeared. The 1844 essay is 
much easier and more satisfactory reading than the 
earlier outline. It is a far more carefully prepared 
statement of the subject, which was originally written 
as a sort of " insurance policy " on Darwin's ideas as 
to the origin of species. In event of his sudden 
death it was intended that this essay should serve as 
the basis of a presentation of his ideas to the public, 
to be expanded by a competent editor. Happily, 
the occasion never came to make this use of the 
essay. It served in Darwin's own hands as the 
nucleus in the preparation of the 4 * Origin." As a 
piece of book-making the present volume displays 
that excellence which one associates with the products 
of the Cambridge ( England) University Press, from 
which the book is issued. The volume forms an 
interesting addition to existing Darwiniana.

with the world-conqueror and his helpers. " Napo- 
leon's Marshals" (Little, Brown, & Co.), the work 
of Mr. R. P. Dunn-Pattison, a writer who is both a 
soldier and a scholar, is superior in both matter and 
manner to the general mass of this literature. It is 
neither vulgar gossip nor ambitious theorizing, but 
an honest effort to place before the reader the lead- 
ing experiences and the personal peculiarities of each 
of twenty-six remarkable men, in such a manner that 
each will leave a distinct and separate impression in 
the memory ; a difficult goal to reach, it is true, and 
one which has led to some perilously unqualified 
statements. But the slips are unimportant, and the 
book is in the main an admirable one. A succinct 
and comprehensive Introduction sketches the history 
of France during the Napoleonic period ; a table 



termed a " Synopsis of the Marshals " notes for each 
the date of his birth, the date of his reception of the 
Marshal's baton, his titles, and the date and manner 
of his death. Berthier, Massena, Davout, Lannes, 
Soult. Ney, and Bernadotte, are listed as the really 
great names, the others as owing their eminence to 
accident as well as merit. It would be interesting 
to discuss the author's clear-cut characterization of 
each separate hero, but it is perhaps more worth 
while to note some general statements : that every 
Marshal but four was a trained soldier; that though 
most of them rose rapidly from humble positions, 
the French army of those days was so peculiarly 
managed that the non-commissioned officers were 
better commanders than the holders of commissions 
in many other armies : that these men had enjoyed 
advantages in the school of war almost unprece- 
dented in history ; that they were picked and trained 
(to quote our present author's phrasing of a popular 
qualification) by " him whom nature had adorned 
with the greatest intellect that the world has yet 
seen." The new book is a real acquisition to the 
literature of its class. 



The story of Robert College in Constantinople 
mfs^ionarv was founded by Christopher R. 

college. Robert, and was guided for years by 

its first president, Cyrus Hamlin; but no man is 
responsible in a larger degree for its marvellous 
influence in the near Orient than Dr. Hamlin's son- 
in-law, George Washburn of Boston, who was its 
president from 1872 till 1903, besides serving as a 
teacher there for some years before and after that 
period, whose history of the College, with the rather 
unsatisfactory title "Fifty Years in Constantinople," 
is issued from the press of Houghton Mifflin Co. 
Dr. Washburn writes with the unconscious power 
of a man absorbed by his theme ; so that a book 
which is absolutely without literary ambition, and is 
to a large extent statistical information, becomes a 
story of absorbing interest. The College was opened 
in 1863, with four students, three English and one 
American : and through the years since then — 
years of heroic struggle made harder by Turkish 
folly, Bulgarian recklessness, Russian cupidity, 
English statecraft, French and German jealousy, 
earthquake, plague, and fire — it has grown to an 
attendance of over four hundred students of every 
race and nation, and to an influence second to that 
of no educational institution in the world. Says Sir 
William Ramsay in his " Impressions of Turkey ": 
" I have come in contact with men educated in 
Robert College, . . . Greek, Armenian, and Pro- 
testant, and have everywhere been struck by the 
marvellous way in which a certain uniform type, 
direct, simple, honest, and lofty in tone, has been 
impressed upon them, . . . and it is diametrically 
! opposite to the type produced by growth under the 
' ordinary conditions of Turkish life." The narra- 
tive is increased in value by an Introduction dealing 
J with the history of Turkey for the period in question.

THE DIAL 



Nov. 16, 



An essayist who The torch of Charles Lamb flickers 
is clever, but pleasantly in the hands of Mr. E. V. 
not too clever. Lucas, whose new volume of essays, 
"One Day and Another" (Macmillan), contains 
the whimsically cheerful commentary on to-day and 
yesterday in England that we have learned to look 
for from the author of "Listener's Lure " and "Over 
Bemerton's." It is a piece of very real good fortune 
for readers who care for quietly human books, that 
Mr. Lucas has managed to escape the burden of 
needing to appear breathlessly clever — a burden 
which weighs so heavily upon most of his contem- 
poraries who write essays. In the briefest of his 
papers is a sense of leisure which is one of their chief 
charms. Like his delightful hero of five-and-fifty 
in "Over Bemerton's," Mr. Lucas is a looker-on 
at things Edwardian through later- Victorian spec- 
tacles, and is always reminiscent even when he 
is most modern. " A Rhapsodist at Lord's " is 
Francis Thompson ; but the rhapsody is pn a game 
seen by the author of "The Hound of Heaven " in 
the seventies. There is motoring in one of the 
papers, but the real theme is coaching and Dickens's 
coachmen. In spite of his fondness for the records 
of yesterday, Mr. Lucas avoids the " sadness of the 
backward look " very skilfully — too skilfully, per- 
haps, for some of his older readers whom his masters 
have trained to enjoyment of the gentle melancholy 
of remembrance. But if an essayist to-day were 
too obviously a laudator temporis acti, he could 
hardly be popular. And if Mr. Lucas were not 
popular, he would write fewer books — in which 
case all classes of his readers would be the poorer ; 
for if he sometimes chronicles the smallest of small 
beer, it is always with a charm for which we are 
grateful. 

No good deeds are done in the world, 

£*o£?« 2£. no di r ine lif e is lived in * sim p ] y that 

criticism may lay hold of them and 
serve them up as the food of thought. However 
much freedom we may choose to claim in dealing 
intellectually with even the most sacred things, we 
have yet occasion to remember that there may be 
much more vital ends of persuasion and inspiration 
in the use of them by other minds. If a brand may 
have fallen here and there from a fire that is giving 
light and heat through a wide range, we may restore 
it to its right position, and in so doing add a little to 
the first ministration ; but we still have opportunity, 
with all standing about it, to gather comfort from 
the blaze. Familiar language slowly wears out to 
many minds ; its imagery grows faint, its connections 
are lost. The story told again, in simple words with 
closer relations, may quicken insight and awaken 
feeling. The life of Christ, as given by the Evan- 
gelists, is fragmentary ; rehearsed once more in plain 
speech and with unquestioning faith, it may gather 
fresh impulse and call out new trust. This is the 
purpose and this the effect of the little book entitled 
"The Divine Story: a Life of Christ for Young 
People " by the Rev. Cornelius J. Holland, a devout 



and scholarly priest of the Catholic faith. The direct- 
ness, confidence, and sincerity of the author call out 
kindred feelings in the reader. The secondary 
changes in a familiar path through the forest or the 
meadow may make it pleasanter to the foot and re- 
store its appeal to the feelings. Such a service has 
Father Holland rendered for many quiet disciples, 
bringing back the faith of life to its native intrinsic 
quality of a divine revelation. 



Wvttivtet of Memories of his boyhood home have 
village life come flooding the soul of Mr. Jacob 

in Denmark. A gjj^ until } le nas f elt move d to 

write another book of an autobiographical character 
— a sort of supplement to "The Making of an 
American." This time he calls his book " The Old 
Town" (Macmillan), and devotes a half-score of 
chapters to half-humorous, half-serious, and often 
more than half-pathetic, descriptive and anecdotic 
accounts of the joys and sorrows, the excellences 
and defects, the lovable eccentricities and amusing 
whimsicalities, of the " stalwart Jutes " dwelling in 
and about the old Danish village of Ribe. With 
pardonable pride he touches, in passing, on the cor- 
diality and respect with which he, the runaway and 
scapegrace of years ago, was received upon revisit- 
ing the scenes of his youth. Honored by having his 
health drunk to by old King Christian, decorated 
with the latter's much-coveted cross, and invited to 
dine with Crown Prince Frederik (as the present 
King was then styled), Mr. Riis naturally feels that 
he, the black sheep and the dunce, as he calls him- 
self, of his class at school, has made a record that 
compares not unfavorably with that of the undistin- 
guished good boys who always knew their lessons 
and obeyed the master. Naturally also he is now 
torn with a divided loyalty, between admiration for 
his American hero and ex-President, and hereditary 
allegiance to the King who so won his heart by unex- 
pected kindnesses and marks of honor. The book 
has numerous drawings, often more spirited than 
artistically excellent, and is very good reading 
throughout. 

Pictures of "Army Letters from an Officer's 

army life in Wife " (Appleton), by Mrs. Frances 
the far West. jyj A Roe, is a collection of descrip- 
tive and narrative sketches from the pen of a young 
and open-eyed woman, recently married (in the 
beginning of the book) to a West Point graduate, 
and accompanying him to his first military post. 
Whether the letters are all real letters, written and 
mailed to actual correspondents, one may doubt, 
partly from their bearing no more definite date than 
the month and year ; but they manifestly describe 
actual experiences of a lively and varied character. 
Army stations in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming 
are the successive scenes of the narrative, which 
covers a period of seventeen years, from 1871 to 
1888 ; and besides the more ordinary occupations 
and incidents there are buffalo-hunting, trout-fishing, 
the excitement of a horse-thief trial, the discomfort

and alarm of a sand-storm, the merry-making of a 
Christmas in garrison, and many other things, 
amusing and otherwise ; but apparently no battles 
or sieges, forced marches or hurried retreats. In 
short, it all seems to have been a prolonged picnic 
on the plains for those concerned, to judge by this 
vivacious account of it. It acquires added interest 
from being, as the writer says, "a life that has 
passed — as has passed the buffalo and the antelope 
— yes, and the log and adobe quarters for the 
Army." A frontispiece portrait of Mrs. Roe, in 
military costume and with her dog Hal, and numer- 
ous drawings of a spirited character, serve to com- 
plete the book's varied attractions. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The John Lane Co. send us a second edition (which 
seems to be no more than a reprint of the first, pub- 
lished just a quarter of a century ago) of ■ The Coun- 
tess of Albany," a fascinating biographical study by 
" Vernon Lee." The new edition has, however, several 
portrait illustrations that did not accompany its prede- 
cessor. 

From The State Company, Columbia, S. C, we have 
another Civil War book — " Butler and His Cavalry in 
the War of Secession, 1861-1865," by U. R. Brooks, 
who when a boy enlisted in M. O. Butler's command 
and for four years followed the Confederate guidons. 
The book, which is well printed, contains much that 
will be of value to historians, but the material is poorly 
arranged. It is a soldier's scrapbook containing the 
war reminiscences of numerous individuals, addresses, 
resolutions, official papers, and clippings from news- 
papers. The collection is for the most part interesting, 
and its value lies in the light it throws on Confederate 
Army life. 

We have frequently had occasion to praise the series 
of " English Readings," published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. It is a series exceptionally attractive in 
appearance, and the volumes are edited with much 
more than the average judgment and intelligence. Two 
recent volumes in this series are " Old Testament Nar- 
ratives," edited by Professor George Henry Nettleton, 
and " Selections from the Critical Writings of Edgar 
Allan Poe," edited by Professor F. C. Prescott The 
latter volume includes the three essays by which Poe is 
best known as a critical writer, his study of " The 
American Drama " (1845), and a number of his briefer 
criticisms. 

Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co. publish a revised edition 
of their " Gems of German Song," a collection of over 
half a hundred lyrics, the majority of them unapproach- 
able masterpieces. The same publishers also send us 
a collection of " Sacred Songs for High Voice," num- 
bering about half as many examples as the collection 
previously named, and notable for the fact that not a 
single composer of the first work is represented in the 
contents. Only one name of even secondary signifi- 
cance — that of Gounod — is included in the list. This 
does not mean, of course, that the composers repre- 
sented are not estimable writers, or that their perform- 
ance is not creditable, but we cannot help thinking of 
" Die Allonackt," for example, and noticing the dif- 
ference. 



Notes. 



"My Pets," newly translated from the French of 
Alexandre Dumas by Mr. Alfred Allinson, and embel- 
lished with a series of pictures, is a recent publication 
of the Macmillan Co. 

" Swinburne's Dramas " is the title of a volume edited 
by Dr. Arthur Beatty, and published by Messrs. Thomas 
Y. Crowell & Co. Only three of the dramas are given 
— the two Greek tragedies and " Mary Stuart." There 
is an introduction, a bibliography, and a slender outfit 
of notes. 

Two more volumes in the edition of the writings of 
M. Anatole France, published by the John Lane Co., 
give us " The Merry Tales of Jacques Tournebroche " 
and " Child Life in Town and Country," translated by 
Mr. Alfred Allinson ; and " Penguin Island," translated 
by Mr. A. W. Evans. 

An attractive single-volume edition of " The Poems 
of Oscar Wilde " is published by Messrs. John W. Luce 
& Co. It is an authorized edition, and, as far as our 
observation has gone, a complete one. At the same 
time we have from Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons a new 
edition of Wilde's " De Profundis," edited by Mr. 
Robert Ross. 

" Eloquent Sons of the South " is a two-volume col- 
lection of examples of Southern oratory, from Patrick 
Henry to Henry W. Grady. The volumes are small, 
but they seem to have required the services of three 
editors — Messrs. John Temple Graves, Clark Howell, 
and Walter Williams, — and they are sent us by the 
Chappie Publishing Co., Boston. 

" Art in Great Britain and Heland," by Sir Walter 
Armstrong, is a volume in the series entitled " Ars 
Una : Species Mille," published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. A complete general history of art is 
projected in this series, and a dozen or more volumes 
are already announced. The illustrations are small, 
but very numerous, and the comprehensiveness of this 
feature is the most marked characteristic of the volume. 

The St. Louis Society of Psychology has undertaken 
the publication, by subscription, of a translation of 
" Hegel's Larger Logic," as made by the late Henry C. 
Bookmeyer. This will be the first complete publica- 
tion of the work in English, and will fill either two or 
three volumes, at eight dollars a set. The manuscript 
has been carefully revised by Mr. Louis J. Block, and 
a special introduction has been written by Dr. William 
T. Harris. The work will contain engraved portraits 
of the author, the translator, and the editor. 

An interesting and valuable publication is announced 
by the Dodge Publishing Company in a series of repro- 
ductions of typical examples of the leading schools of 
painting from the collection in the National Gallery of 
London. The unique feature of this series is that the 
paintings selected are faithfully reproduced not only in 
line and composition, but in color and tone, so that the 
student or art-lover has before him what is practically 
a reduced facsimile of the original. The collection 
begins with the earliest Italian masters, coming down 
through the periods of Botticelli, Perugino, Correggio, 
and Titian, and the Flemish and German schools, to 
the more modern English and French painters. The 
explanatory and critical text is by such well-known 
authorities as Kenedy, Brockwell, and Lippmann. The 
series will be complete in seventeen parts, each contain- 
ing about thirty pages of text, with six colored plates.

William De Morgan's Great Novels 

It Never Can Happen Again 

NOW READY 

MR. DE MORGAN'S new novel is a masterpiece of construction and intimate 
knowledge, and in some respects a greater novel than any of his earlier ones ; 
its aspect is as sound, and the book is more subtle. 

The plot itself completely holds the attention ; the stage is full and the actors 
are many. The classes represented include every scale of English society brought 
together with extraordinary dexterity. There are two main themes. One is the 
love of Blind Jim for his little daughter Lizarann, and here Mr. De Morgan is at 
his best — no other living author can depict as he can the lower orders of cockney 
society. The second main theme is the account of the doings of Sir Titus Scropp, 
novelist, Marianne his wife, and Judith Arkroyd, with stage ambitions, daughter of a 
wealthy baronet, perhaps the most fascinating woman Mr. De Morgan has yet drawn. 
The book is entirely convincing — it is Mr. De Morgan at his best, and will be 
read years hence when most of the productions of the day have been long forgotten. 

($1.75.) 

Joseph Vance Somehow Good 



In this, his first novel, Mr. De Morgan tells a 
touching story, yet full of humor, of life-long love 
and heroic sacrifice. While the scene is mostly in 
and near the London of the fifties, there are some 
telling glimpses of Italy. ($1.75.) 

" The book of the last decade ; the best thing in fiction 
since Mr. Meredith and Mr. Hardy ; must take its place as 
the first gTeat English novel that has appeared in the twen- 
tieth century.'' — Lewis Melville in New York Times 
Saturday Review. 

" If the reader likes both ' David Copperfield ' and ' Peter 
Ibbetson,' he can find the two books in this one." 

— The Independent. 

Alice=for=Short 

The scheme of Alice-for-short, which might 
paradoxically be called a genial ghost-and-murder 
story, is utterly different, yet humor and humanity 
again dominate. It is the story of a London waif, 
a friendly artist, his friends and family. The reap- 
pearance in Nineteenth Century London of the long- 
buried past, and a remarkable case of suspended 
memory, give the dramatic background. ($1.75.) 

" Really worth reading and praising. If any 
writer of the present era is read a half century hence, 
a quarter century, or even a decade, that writer is 
William De Morgan." — Boston Transcript. 




The dramatic story of some modern English 
people in a strange situation. Its purpose and feel- 
ing are intense, yet it is all mellowed by humor, and 
it contains the author's freshest and most sympa- 
thetic story of young love. ($1.75.) 

" A book as sound, as sweet, as wholesome, as wise, as 
any in the range of fiction." — The Nation. 

" A higher quality of enjoyment than is derivable from 
the work of any other novelist now living and active in 
either England or America. Absolutely masterly. The 
plot is extremely ingenious and complicated." — The Dial. 

"Why all this Popularity ?" 

asks E. V. Lucas, writing of these novels in the 
Outlook, and he answers, De Morgan is " almost 
the perfect example of the humorist, certainly the 
completist since Lamb . . . there is hardly a single 
page that is free from a smile. . . . Humor, how- 
ever, is not all. There must also be enough dramatic 
interest to hold the reader, enough fidelity to the 
fact in the character-drawing to persuade. ... In 
the De Morgan world it is hard to find an unat- 
tractive figure even among the less admirable . . . 
the charm of the young women. . . . All brave and 
humorous and gay, and all trailing clouds of glory 
from the fairyland from which they have just come."

Happy Hawkins 

By ROBERT ALEXANDER WASON 

This atory of the big-hearted, lovable, whimsical Wes- 
terner has made its author's reputation and is proving 
the most popular novel of the season to give a man for 
Christmas. 

" His story is so good," says the Nation, " and he tells 
it with such a fine capacity for knowing how to do it, that 
every page does, indeed, hold the interest in a grip that is 
at first surprise, then admiration, and at last positive

This is the much-discussed, greatest novel of the great 
English novelist. " It is masterly," says the Outlook. " a 
really profound study of motive and character. Like ' Tess 
of the D'Urbervilles.' it deals boldly with the problems of 
passion, and may offend in this way, but like that book, 
also, it is essentially dramatic." $1.25 net; postage, 12c.

A Great Scientific Work that is the Book of the Day. 

After Death —What? 

Spiritistic Phenomena and Their Interpretation 

By CESARE LOMBROSO, Author of "The Female 
Offender," " The Man of Genius," etc. 

The most important contribution in years to the litera- 
ture of psychical research, scientific and profound, and 
yet, says the New York Sun, "an entertaining and ex- 
tremely readable account of spiritualism in its more 
modern form, that is to say, as it appears under the 
investigation of professors of psychology." 

"Professor Lombroso's book," says the Boston Trans- 
cript, "is certain to be widely read, quoted from, and 
commented on not only by reason of its author's acknowl- 
edged eminence, but because it deals largely with Eusapia 
Palladino, the most talked about medium in the world." 

Professor Lombroso's death three days after the pub- 
lication of the book, and Signora Palladino's present visit 
to America, have added a unique and dramatic interest 
1 to the volume.

able. The book has already aroused unusual discussion 
abroad and will clearly be the most widely discussed book 
of its class in this country this winter. " Professor James," 
says the New York. Times, " has at last encountered a 
foeman worthy of his steel — both as a thinker and as a 
master of clean cut and luminous expression." " His 
criticism of American life," says the Nation, "is extra- 
ordinarily keen." Beady about December 1.

Lieutenant Ernest H. Shackleton's own narrative 

The Heart of the Antarctic 

A Complete Record of His Antarctic Voyage of 1907-1909

at the present time. It is not merely made up of newspaper articles and fragmentary sketches, but it is Lieutenant 
Shackleton's own account of an unusually successful expedition, carefully planned and carried out. Outside of the 
important scientific facts and discoveries revealed in the book, it is full of exciting adventure, wonderfully illustrated, and 
is undoubtedly the greatest work of exploration of the year.

THE BIG NOVEL OF 1909 

ROBERT HICHENS' GREATEST NOVEL 



Bella Donna 



A Powerful Story 
of the Desert and 

the Wo nderful 
Valley of the Nile. 



"Again Robert Hichens has taken his reader to North- 
ern Africa. This time to the Nile Valley and its sands, 
its rocky wilderness and the ruins of millenniums. Here 
his rich imagination has developed one of those Anglo- 
Oriental romances in the weaving of which he has proved 
himself a past-master. Again the reader may enjoy the 
vivid coloring of his pen pictures of the desert. His de- 
scriptive powers have lost none of their force. In this 
latest work of his, ' Bella Donna,' the artist shows him- 
self worthy of the author of ■ The Garden of Allah.' "

very cold. Almost one can feel the thin sharp winds blowing off these remote monsters. The text, which is charmingly 
written, strengthens the illusion. ... It is in very simple, modest fashion that the work done by the three climbers is 
recorded. Mr. Mumm has, too, a capitally light touch, so that the story of his Himalayan campaign, though devoid of 
dramatic episodes or anything that savors of wild adventure, is somehow very interesting and amusing. As for the pictures, 
they are. as we have already indicated, a source of profound joy by themselves. . . ." — Tribune (New York).

TWENTY- ONE YEARS AGO 



Charlotte Porter and Helen A. Clarke issued the first number of POET 
LORE — which they still edit. 

Their object was to publish a genuine magazine of letters. The prospect 
did not look encouraging, but they possessed the courage of their convic- 
tions and the magazine was started. 

To-day POET LORE is recognized throughout the world as maintaining 
the highest literary standard of any publication in America. — A complete file 
is practically unobtainable and certain numbers sell at $4.00 and $5.00 each. 

POET LORE has become indispensable to the true student. Every article 
it prints is a permanent addition to the literature of the subject it discusses. 

A particularly notable feature is the unabridged translation of some foreign 
play in each issue. POET LORE is always the first to discover genuine merit 
and introduce it to the American literary public. The first translations of 
Maeterlinck, D'Annunzio, Gorki, Strindberg, and Sudermann — to mention 
only a few of its discoveries — appeared in POET LORE. 

During 1909 its plays have been Hebbel's Agnes Bernauer, Hauptmann's 
Hannele and Before Dawn, de Curel's Beat of the Wing, Hervieu's In Chains 
and Hennique's Death of the Due d'Engbien. 

POET LORE is published bi-monthly at $1.00 a copy and $4.00 a year. 

After January 1, 1909, the subscription price will be increased to $5.00 a year. 

Three sample copies will be sent for $1.00 to those who desire to consider 
the possibility of becoming subscribers. This amount will be refunded if 
you do not care to retain the copies sent, or, if you subscribe, it will be 
credited on your first subscription. 

This offer expires December 31, when the yearly subscription price becomes 
$5.00, and the price for all single copies $1.00 each.

by the famous Japanese artist, Yoshio Markino, and with an essay by the 
artist. Large type, heavy paper. 8vo. Cloth, uncut edges. $5.00 net. 
A delightful blending of description, history, and narrative, giving in fullest 
sense the " local color " of the Imperial City, that great centre of art, religion, and 
history. Mr. Potter has done full justice to his very difficult subject, and it is 
doubtful if a better account of modern Rome, revealing in it also the ancient and mediaeval city, can be found. 
Mr. Markino, the artist, has brought to his task that keen perception of contrasts and that trained eye for color 
that are peculiar to the oriental.

The Friday Literary Review 

of The CHICAGO EVENING POST claims the attention of every 
one who reads books in America. 

C Book criticism in general is either commercial or academic. The 
Friday Literary Review offers criticism which is neither commercial nor 
academic. It takes books as the vital record of contemporary thought 
and spirit, and recommends them in the degree that they are likely to 
serve, interest, or amuse the intelligent secular reader. 

d Books are more than merchandise. The Friday Literary Review does 
not praise a book because it will sell. It is not governed by its advertisers. 
Neither does it toady to popular opinion. 

C Books are more than academic documents. The Friday Literary 
Review does not believe in labored reference to the opinion of the past. 
It defers to the right spirit and to intellect, not necessarily to tradition. 

C The Friday Literary Review does not address its reviews to author or 
to publisher. It addresses its reviews to the intelligent person who is 
interested in the new books, whether that person be professional or busi- 
ness man, professional woman or housewife. 

d. All the new books published in America are reviewed in its columns 
in classified groups. Each week a full-page exhaustive criticism is made 
of the book whose special importance entitles it to be considered The 
Book of the Week. 

CL Shan F. Bullock, the Irish novelist, communicates London literary 
views in every issue. A New York publisher gives exclusive New York 
news under the pseudonym of Bayswell. 

C Vital literary topics are focused, and discussed at length, in the regular 
editorial. 

C A special feature peculiar to the Friday Literary Review is the Maga- 
zine Critique, in which the significant articles of the day are singled out 
and discussed. 

€L Special care is taken in sifting and presenting the gossip of the literary 
world. 

C Two representative opinions of the Friday Literary Review are as 
follows : 

C Wtn. Lyon Phelps, professor of English Literature at Yale University, 
says : " The book reviews and literary comments please me immensely by 
their penetration, their originality and by their humor. ... I think that 
these supplements cannot fail to be of immense benefit in increasing 
thoughtful interest in literature." 

C John Spargo writes: " I can truthfully say that no publication of its 
kind has given me the same amount of satisfaction and pleasure that I 
have derived from your literary supplement." 

«L THE CHICAGO EVENING POST FRIDAY LITERARY 
REVIEW is an illustrated magazine supplement completely devoted to 
books. Together with the regular Friday issue of the newspaper, it will 
be sent to any address in the United States outside Chicago

TAMAM 



By CHARLES CHILTON MOORE 

Neale Publishing- Company, New York. $1.50. 

" A very big thought in a very unusual and sometimes classic 
book." — Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in the iVew York Journal. 

" Quite unlike other books, and not amenable to classifica- 
tion, ' Taraam ' presents a series of studies of the inner life and 
of psychological experience intertwined with pictures of the 
outer side of life, varied with pleasing descriptions of natural 
scenes, and all bound together with a thread of intense emotion 
afforded by the love of a strong, deep-natured man and a 
woman of equal strength of feeling. The author does not even 
give these two people names, and they pass in and out of the 
scenes almost as weirdly as if they were ghosts deeply colored 
with human passions. The book has a certain quiet strength 
combined with refinement of feeling, and is very well written. 
The title is a Persian word, meaning oblivion." — The New 
York Times, Jan. 30. 

"Some of the musings on life and death and sorrow and 
mystery are beautifully expressed, full of melancholy and 
pathos." — Louisville Courier- Journal. 

" The book is evidently written by a poet and a dreamer, and 
will be best appreciated by such;" — Philadelphia Book News.

LITTLE STORIES OF QUEBEC 

By JAMES EDWARD LeROSSIGNOL 

Six stories of a high literary quality, humorous and pathetic, drawn from the lives of the habitants of old Quebec Province — 
those strong and simple people made famous by Gilbert Parker and the poet Drummond. Our author has reflected truthfully 
their simplicity of life, their unaffected reverence for sacred things, their extreme conservatism, and their general bonhomie, 
which makes them beloved by all who know them. 

"One of the most charming gift books of the season, both in form and contents, is 'Little Stories of Quebec' The chief 
characteristic of the stories lies in their quaint and subtle humor. They are also fresh with a new and delightful human interest, 
atmosphere, and the throb of pathos which we associate with French Canadian literature is keenly felt. We see the villager, his 
wife, the farmer, the lumberman, drawn with the fine sensitiveness of an artist's pen. Best of all is the village Pere, who covers 
every soul in his isolated parish with fatherly solicitude, and fails to understand himself."— The Post. 

" ' Father Grandmaison' will probably be by many considered the gem of the collection, and its delicate pathos and grace have 
retained with ourselves the first place as our favorite. The decorations and illustrations by Laura Miller are extremely well 
executed, and add greatly to the literary attractions of the volume."— The Montreal Star.

ENGLISH POEMS: The Elizabethan Age and the Puritan Period By Walter c. bronson 

So favorable has been the reception accorded " The Nineteenth Century" and " The Restoration and the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury" that the present volume needs little introduction. It follows the same general plan as its predecessors, with the added 
advantage of an especially fascinating field —the most spontaneous and exuberant period of English poetry. The notes contain 
elucidations of difficult passages and illuminating commentary — the index and bibliography are unusually elaborate and detailed.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PRAYER By anna louise strono 

A systematic investigation from the point of view of modern psychology of the mental processes involved in prayer. Prayer 
is described as the result of the " conflict between different selves." This conflict in turn is eliminated by the prayer process. 
Numerous examples from actual observation of children add vividness to the work, which has a deep philosophic interest and 
throws lig'ht on present-day religious problems. 125 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net 75 cents, postpaid 83 cents. 

THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER By james edward Rogers 

This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper, and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been 
made. The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question, the subject of discussion being treated as one of 
concrete fact, and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of 
getting acquainted with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment. The book discusses in succession the following topics: 
The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper; The City and the Newspaper; The Nature of the American Newspaper; The 
Influence of the American Newspaper, and the Causes of that Influence. 228 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.00, postpaid $1.10. 

BIBLICAL IDEAS OF ATONEMENT: Their History and Significance 

By ERNEST DeWITT BURTON, JOHN MERLIN POW1S SMITH, and GERALD BIRNEY SMITH 

This book sets forth the content of the biblical teachings upon the subject of Atonement, and suggests the point of view from 
which these conceptions may profitably be studied at the present day. The attitude assumed toward the records throughout is 
that of historical interpretation rather than of theological systematization. Consequently, the effort is to discover precisely what 
ideas of atonement are reflected by the biblical laws, institutions, and utterances. The authors employ the historical method 
throughout. To trace the history of an idea is to discover the forces that have co-operated to produce it and to transform it from 
age to age. The history of the idea is thus its best explanation. Yet as many readers will desire, not only a historical statement 
of what was believed and taught by the prophets and teachers of old, but also some indication of the value of those teachings for 
the present day, the closing section of the book (Chap, xii, xiii) is devoted to this aspect of the matter. 338 pages, 12mo, cloth ;

INTRODUCTIONS TO 
NOTABLE POEMS 

By HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE 
Author of "My Study Fire," "The 

Life of the Spirit," "Poems Every 
Child Should. Know." etc. 
The present volume is a collection 
of some of the greatest poems 
of the English language — poems 
which everyone ought to know, 
which most people would be glad 
to know, but in its entirety a col- 
lection which, as a matter of fact, 
most people do not know. Each 
poem is introduced by a graceful 
essay which not only throws light 
upon the life of the poet, the sub- 
jectof the poem, thecircumstances 
under which it was written, etc.. 
but which also gives the results of 
the latest and ripest criticisms. 
Illustrated with twelve portraits.

SOME WONDERS OF 
BIOLOGY 

By WILLIAM H. THOMSON, M.D., 

Author of " Brain and Personality," 

" What Is Physical Life? " etc. 
Fortunate indeed is the man in the 
street when some scientist like Dr. 
Thomson, who is eminent in his 
own profession, writes about the 
subject which he has studied all 
his life, and which he knows. And 
especially fortunate is the man in 
the street when the specialist 
possesses, like Dr. Thomson, a 
graphic and pungent style, apt- 
ness of illustration, an ability to 
explain and illuminate, and to 
torn a dry-as-dust discussion into 
an absorbingly interesting narra- 
tive. Then the reading of such a 
book as " Some Wonders of Bio- 
logical Science," which deals with 
tacts and weighty problems, be- 
comes not a duty, but a matter of 
enjoyment. Here the average in- 
telligent man can learn something 
on questions about which he inevi- 
tably thinks and speculates, most 
often mistakenly, for these ques- 
tions are discussed clearly and 
without technicalities, not by some 
enthusiastic and misinformed mid- 
dleman, but by a scientist who 
stands high in his profession, and 
whose word is not only of great 
interest, but great weight.

A GUIDE TO MODERN 
OPERA 

By ESTHER SINGLETON 
Author of "A Guide to the Opera," 

Illustrated with Portraits of 
Famous Operatic Stars 

Miss Singleton's M A Guide to the 
Opera," has enjoyed a deserved 
success for a long time . It repre- 
sents thoughtful and painstaking 
work, and it gives the reader a 
more careful and complete ac- 
count of the history of each opera, 
the story and the music, than any 
popular book published. In writ- 
ing a new volume. Miss Singleton

comprehensive plan in describing 
the newest operas. As a result this 
book contains more information 
about the text and the music of

TREMENDOUS TRIFLES 

By GILBERT K. CHESTERTON 
Author of " Heretics," " Varied Types," etc. 
Mr. Chesterson is unquestionably one of the most brilliant essay- 
ists of the day. He is startlingly original, for his ideas are always 
in opposition to those commonly held : but no matter how unheard 
of and startling his hypotheses, he can back them up with subtle 
arguments, flashes of humor, and sheer cleverness until the reader 
is wholly fascinated. He is said to be the most brilliant talker in 
England ; and as his essays are nothing but written talks, a new 
volume of them appeals mightily to all literary-minded people.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



THE SONG OF SONGS 

Translated by Thomas Seltzer. 
By HERMANN SUDERMANN 12mo. Cloth. $1.40 net; by mail $1.55. 

Sudermann's many dramas and novels may be regarded as merely preliminary studies for this, his masterpiece. It is the story 
of a beautiful girl animated by high ideals and beset by temptations on every side. Lilly suggests, remotely, Daudet's Sappho 
and Dumas's Camille, in a nobler embodiment. Alone in the world, loving and sympathetic by disposition, she encounters suc- 
cessively sordid poverty, wealth and libertinism, false love, dazzling bohemianism, perfect bliss, then commonplace Philistinism. 
How she threads her way over high peaks and through dark valleys, how she resists and how she succumbs, are the actuating 
springs of a novel incomparable in this decade. 

HUMAN EQUIPMENT: ITS USE AND ABUSE 

( In The Art of Life Series ) 

By EDWARD HOWARD GRIQQS 

This new book deals with the problem, so acutely important in our money-mad society, of the right use of things— the relation 
of man, both individually and collectively taken, to the tools and equipment of civilization. Its central thesis forms a trenchant 
criticism of the persistent superstition that lavish expenditure in careless luxury benefits society. The author shows, both by 
economic argument and historic example, that all use of the power money represents for what is either useless or harmful, forces 
some one to work harder somewhere in the social structure, and unchecked is paid for at a terrible price in the end. Incidentally, 
there is an illuminating discussion of the causes of panics — those " clearing-houses in which we pay our bad debts." The style is 
peculiarly forceful and convincing, and the book is full of wise suggestions for the conduct of life. 



12mo. Cloth. 50 cents net ; by mail 55 cents. 



BACK TO HAMPTON ROADS 

A supplementary volume to " With the Battle Fleet." 

By FRANKLIN MATTHEWS Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth. $1.50 postpaid. 

This completes the authoritative story of the cruise of our Fleet, taking up the narrative at San Francisco, where " With the 
Battle Fleet " ends. Mr. Matthews was one of the few civilians who went all around the world with our Fleet. He tells of the visits 
to China, Japan, Hawaii, Philippines, Australia and New Zealand; the countries, people, government; the business, customs, 
politics. As our horizon widens a need is created for such a book as this, for it enables us to understand much of the feverish 
striving in the antipodes.

THE AMER ICAN ACADEMY. 

A good many persons, both in England and 
America, have toyed at times with the notion 
of founding an Academy which should repro- 
duce the familiar French model in one or the 
other branch of the English-speaking world. It 
has been an interesting speculation, and, when 
coupled with the attempt to make a suitable 
selection of names deserving of academic dis- 
tinction, has proved almost as fascinating as 
the attempt to make a list of the hundred (or 
some other number) best books. Either subject 
is one upon which almost everybody feels quali- 
fied to express a judgment, and readily lends 
itself to popular discussion. Ten years ago, 
what we called " the Academy game " was 
started first in this country, under the direction 
of a now long defunct literary journal, and an 
American Academy was constituted by grace of 
popular vote. The results of this plebiscite 
method were about as irrational as might have 
been expected. Mr. James Whitcomb Riley 
and Mr. Richard Harding Davis were elected 
to membership (much to their own astonish- 
ment, we may presume), while Colonel Hig- 
ginson and Charles Eliot Norton were left in the 
outer darkness. " Mark Twain " received more 
votes than Mr. Henry James, and Frank Stock- 
ton more than Edmund Clarence Stedman. 
Moreover, as we pointed out at the time, the 
American list was entirely made up of men of 
letters in the narrower sense, whereas its French 
prototype included only nine representatives of 
belles-lettres in the total of forty names. 

This newspaper Academy was, of course, 
only a matter for jest ; but it so happened that 



440 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



steps were being taken at the same time toward 
the organization of an academic body that should 
be really representative of American leadership, 
and not alone in the narrow field of literary 
achievement. The first step was taken in 1898, 
when the American Social Science Association 
nominated a small group of leaders to form the 
nucleus of a National Institute of Arts and 
Letters. The men thus nominated proceeded 
cautiously to enlarge their membership, eventu- 
ally raising it to the number of two hundred 
and fifty, set as a limit. The next step was 
taken when the Institute, thus brought into 
existence, set about the organization of an 
Academy. The academicians were to be mem- 
bers of the Institute, and were to be fifty in 
number. The method of selection was carefully 
considered, and was as follows : Seven mem- 
bers were chosen by vote of the Institute ; these 
seven elected eight others ; the resulting fifteen 
elected five more, and the twenty thus brought 
together added ten others to their number. By 
similar procedure, the membership was still 
further raised until the limit was closely ap- 
proached. There the matter rests; and thus 
the American Academy has come into existence, 
" not with observation," but none the less the 
embodiment of highly significant fact. 

The best justification for the method em- 
ployed, and the all-sufficient excuse for the 
being of the Academy, is found in the roll of 
its membership. The following list gives all the 
names up to the present date, including those 
of deceased members.

Here are sixty-two names altogether, forty-five 
of them the names of living men, and the col- 
lective distinction of the list is deeply impressive. 
One may miss a well-known name here and there, 
and one may have doubts concerning the academic 
quality of a few of the names included ; but the 
membership of the Academy as a whole is clearly 
representative of what is best in our intellectual 
and artistic life. A third of the names, more 
or less, belong to belles-lettres proper ; the re- 
maining two-thirds represent approximately the 
other fields of distinction recognized by the 
French Academy, and the fine arts other than 
literature, which the French Academy hardly 
recognizes at all. 

This account of the organization is timely be- 
cause, although the Academy has had an unob- 
trusive existence for some five years, it is to 
be more definitely and officially launched within 
the next few days. Following the precedent of 
the American Academy of Sciences, incorporated 
in 1863, it is about to obtain a charter by Act 
of Congress which will emphasize its national 
character. The annual meeting required by its 
constitution will be held December 13-14, at 
Washington ; a reception by President Taf t will 
be a feature of the occasion, and the papers read 
will be published as the first annual volume of 
proceedings. 

It would be futile to attempt to indicate the 
probable course of the activities likely to be 
undertaken by the new Academy. One natur- 
ally inclines to quote from Matthew Arnold's 
classical essay on " The Literary Influence of 
Academies," and we have no doubt of the desir- 
ability of our possessing " an institution owing 
its existence to a national bent toward the things 
of the mind, towards culture, towards clearness, 
correctness, and propriety in thinking and speak- 
ing, and . . . which creates ... a force of 
educated opinion," an institution which will tend 
to maintain a " high, correct standard in intel- 
lectual matters," which will discourage every 
" orthographical antic," every form of " ignor- 
ance and charlatanism," every manifestation of 
" the provincial spirit." Whether our own 
Academy will make for these ends, and for the 
promotion of that " urbanity " which we as a 
people so sadly need, remains to be disclosed. 
It is at least a cause for satisfaction that such 
a start has been made, seemingly in the right 
direction.

RICHARD WATSON GILDER. 



Mr. Gilder died on the eighteenth of November, 
at the age of sixty-five ; and American literature is 
the poorer by one of its most conspicuous represen- 
tatives. Born at Bordentown, N. J., February 8, 
1844, he was the son of a clergyman who afterwards 
conducted a private school on Long Island, and in 
this institution the boy acquired the rudiments of 
his education. Aside from this elementary instruc- 
tion, his education was self-acquired. He learned 
to set type when a child, and at the tender age of 
twelve was editor and publisher of a newspaper. 
In 1860 he joined with two other youths in the 
publication of a campaign newspaper in the interests 
of Bell and Everett- In 1863 he enlisted as a pri- 
vate in a Philadelphia company. After the war, he 
studied law, but soon abandoned it for journalism, 
becoming editor of two Newark newspapers. In 
1870 he edited u Hours at Home " for a few months, 
and later in that year joined with J. G. Holland in 
the editorship of u Scribner's Monthly," then just 
established. In 1881, when Mr. Holland died, the 
magazine was reorganized, re-named ''The Century," 
and Mr. Gilder became editor-in-chief. It is by this 
title that he has been known to the country at large 
for nearly thirty years. As a man of letters he is 
classified among the poets, although his prose work 
is by no means inconsiderable. His verse fills many 
small volumes, and is of sufficient importance to 
insure him a high rank among the men who fall 
just short of being reckoned the major poets of 
America. It is verse that lacks somewhat in sub- 
stance and virility, that rarely strikes the inevitable 
lyric note, but that appeals strongly to the cultivated 
intelligence by virtue of its qualities of intellectual 
distinction, artistic feeling, and exalted idealism. 
But Mr. Gilder has been much more than a man of 
letters, and he is cherished as an example of the 
good citizen by thousands who very likely have 
never read a page of his poetry. Wherever his 
home might be. in New York or in the Berkshires 
or near Buzzard's Bay, he always felt himself a 
member of a community toward which he had social 
obligations. Perhaps the most important civic work 
done by him was as chairman of the New York 
Tenement House Commission ; but mention must 
also be made of his activities in connection with 
civil service reform, with kindergarten and settle- 
ment work, and as president of the City Club of 
New York. He also did stout service for literature 
and art in his work for the Copyright League, the 
Authors' Club, and various art associations, local 
and national. He was one of the first members 
chosen for the American Academy of Arts and Let- 
ters, of which we speak elsewhere in this issue. 
Personally, he was one of the most companionable 
and lovable of men, and few are privileged to enjoy 
such friendships as were his. We do not particu- 
larly mean by this his intimacy with public charac- 
ters — of which Grover Cleveland and Joseph 



Jefferson are perhaps the most conspicuous exam- 
ples — but the relations which he established with 
countless lesser persons, who knew him well enough 
to know how genuine was his nature, how unfailing 
were his sympathies, and how absolute was his 
devotion to goodness and truth and beauty. Those 
who now mourn his untimely death will grieve for 
him more as a personal friend than as a lost public 
leader ; and to say this is to offer the best tribute 
to his memory. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Mr. Gilder's most lasting monument, with 
all his varied activities and achievements, will un- 
doubtedly be the half-hundred and more volumes of 
the magazine he so successfully edited from its 
establishment in 1881 to the day of his death. If 
there are such persons as "born editors," he was 
one. He had taste, industry, literary instincts, and 
many practical qualities not easy to define but indis- 
pensable to the successful purveyor of literary 
wares. He had a keen sense of values, and was ever 
on the alert to secure the worthiest and best (mean- 
ing the best for his purposes) in the literary market 
A reported utterance of his concerning the chances 
of a young and unknown writer with the editors of 
leading periodicals is of interest. u The new writer," 
he asserted, " has every chance. The competition 
for good matter is too great to allow an editor to pass 
over any manuscript without consideration. The 
hope of every editor is that he may be able to secure 
some new light in the literary sky. He is so anxious 
to do this that he often exaggerates the discovery of 
some slight talent He is always discovering that 
he has made mistakes in the past, and I have said 
that an editor's hell is paved with the manuscripts 
which he has rejected, but which he wishes he bad 
accepted. He has turned them down only to find that 
some other editor has discovered genius in them. 
The result is that he is afraid he may miss finding 
the spark of genius in the new manuscripts before 
him, and he often gives the new writers too much 
chance." There is, undoubtedly, truth in this ; yet 
we fancy Mr. Gilder, if pressed, would have testified 
that his editorial remorse was less frequently called 
out by the things he had turned down and wished 
he had accepted than by the things he had accepted 
and wished he had turned down. It was George 
William Curtis, we believe, who said that an editor 
was nearly always right in declining a manuscript 

The late Dr. William T. Harris, who died 
last month at the age of seventy-four, fell just short 
of being a philosopher or a poet beeause he chose to 
be an educator — or was turned into the pedagogic 
path by the fate that seems so inexorably to decide 
for us what we shall do and be. Born in Connecticut 
and educated at Phillips Academy, Andover, and at 
Yale, he won his laurels as educator at St. Louis, 



442 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



whose public school system he planned and directed 
with distinguished success. His twenty years' ser- 
vice as U. S. Commissioner of Education increased 
his fame, and meantime his writings and lectures on 
philosophy and literature, as well as on education, 
brought him recognition as a thorough scholar and a 
profound thinker. Not the least of his titles to re- 
nown was his mastery of the Hegelian philosophy, 
of which he became noted as the leading exponent 
in this country. He founded the Philosophic Society 
of St. Louis, was prominent in the Concord School 
of Philosophy, and started the "Journal of Specula- 
tive Philosophy." Noteworthy among his published 
works is "The Spiritual Sense of Dante's Divine 
Comedy." Since 1900 he had been the editor-in- 
chief of Webster's Dictionary, whose recent re-issue 
in much enlarged and improved form as " The New 
International," shows unmistakably the touches of 
his master-hand — most conspicuously, perhaps, in 
the novel two-story page with its object-lesson in dif- 
ferentiation and judicious subordination. The end 
crowns the work, and, in this instance, the work 
crowns the end of Dr. Harris's useful life. 

The Augustan age of juvenile literature 
will always be the age of our childhood. No subse- 
quent period has equalled it ; no future era will be 
comparable with it. A correspondent of a New 
York newspaper, referring to the late sixties of the 
nineteenth century, makes the assertion (amazing to 
those of us who chanced to be born in that golden 
age ) that " there were few children's books then, 
and most of them were of little account." What a 
mistake ! There were the absurdly delightful " Rollo 
Books " — absurdly delightful, because written in 
that didactic, condescending tone that ought to have 
repelled — and the ever-enchanting fairy tales of the 
Grimm brothers, and the splendid "Arabian Nights" 
(in wisely abridged form), and " Robinson Crusoe," 
and " The Swiss Family Robinson," and Miss Edge- 
worth's stories for children — some of them not half- 
bad reading, forty years ago — and a goodly num- 
ber of other books that, either by design or accident, 
made a strong appeal to wide-eyed youth. Later 
generations of children have sung the praises of 
Henty and Fenn and the long-winded writer of the 
" Elsie Books," and more besides ; but they are de- 
cidedly not the gods of our childhood. The poly- 
chromatic series of fairy books of Mr. Andrew Lang's 
manufacture may get themselves read, perhaps even 
with rapturous delight, by children who had not the 
good fortune to be born forty years ago ; but not all 
the colors of the rainbow will give his volumes the 
charm (for us ) of the immortal Grimm stories. 

Books that must re read in childhood, or 
the chance of enjoying them to the full will be for- 
ever lost, are unfortunately withheld from thousands 
of our hungry-souled, wide-eyed little ones, by rea- 
son of poverty or parental unwisdom or some cul- 
pable neglect from some quarter. Who that has 



read and re-read in infancy the delightful fairy 
stories of the Grimm brothers can doubt that his 
whole after-life was made richer and more significant 
than if these delightfully real and at the same time 
marvellous tales had been kept from him until he 
had reached years of so-called discretion ? The 
Lincoln (Nebraska) Public Library is doing good 
work in guarding, so far as may be, the children of 
that city from the calamity here indicated. "We 
all realize," writes the librarian in her latest Report, 
" that children are losing much pleasure and missing 
things that will be a source of regret to them all 
their lives if certain books are not read." (The 
meaning here is better than the syntax.) " The 
city superintendent of schools appointed a committee 
composed of three high-school teachers of English, 
three grade principals and the librarian to select a 
list of books that would be required reading for the 
seventh and eighth grades. These books were not 
to be books for information and instruction, but they 
were to instill a love of good literature and be valu- 
able from the cultural side." An excellent move ; 
but how much better it would be if the home and 
the parents could in every instance do what the 
library and the librarian and school-teachers are 
seeking to effect ! 

o • • • 

Writing down to the reader's level is 
pretty sure to be resented by the reader, and by 
children not less than by their elders. In one of the 
books of the present season — Dr. George Hodges's 
" Garden of Eden " — the unfortunate attempt has 
again been made to re-tell some of the grand old 
Bible stories in language supposed to suit young 
readers. Charm and mystery and poetic truth are 
thus ruthlessly made to give place to flat incredibility 
and tiresome absurdity. The fact that the King 
James version of the Bible is in English such as was 
never spoken in everyday life is nothing against it 
as a work of literature. Homer's wonderful epics, 
with all their naturalness and directness of appeal, 
are written in Greek such as was never used by any 
branch of the Hellenic race — as Professor Mahaffy 
reminded us a year ago in his Lowell Institute 
lectures. Dr. Hodges must be able to recall, as so 
many of us can, the nameless charm and the unap- 
proachable majesty of the Old Testament language 
as it falls on young and but half-understanding ears. 
Nor does the child wish to understand wholly ; some 
margin must be left for the imagination. The poetry 
of the Bible, and in fact all poetry, appeals to chil- 
dren largely through the mere sound of the words 
— their rhythm and stateliness and their unusualness. 
Common language and words of one syllable the 
child can have in abundance without seeking them 
in poetry and romance. 

The public library and the grateful 
farmer is the theme of an editorial note in a 
recent issue of " New York Libraries," a monthly 
journal just entering on its second year of intelligent 
service. A wealthy farmer living in the neighbor- 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



443 



hood of a small city library had been disposed to 
look upon this purveyor of literature as a superfluity 
and a passing fad. But in a moment of sore per- 
plexity and pressing need, when one of his valuable 
cows was sick and likely to die, the scornful farmer 
humbled his pride and sought counsel of the libra- 
rian, if perchance the latter might know of some 
book in his collection treating of bovine ailments and 
prescribing a remedy for such cases as the one in 
question. Surely enough, the desired work on vet- 
erinary science was soon forthcoming ; its advice 
was followed, and the cow's life was saved. The 
farmer was properly grateful, and when, soon after- 
ward, he fell sick, and, despite his nearness to the 
library, failed to find a cure for his disease, it was 
discovered, at the opening of his last will and testa- 
ment, that he had left seventy-five thousand dollars 
to the institution that had saved his cow's life. As 
a fitting sequel to this true story, the editor makes 
room for a list of about seventy of the best books on 
agriculture now available for public libraries, a list 
selected by Professor Tuck of the State Agricultural 
College at Cornell, and undoubtedly trustworthy 
and valuable. ... 

Political oratory as literature does not 
appeal to most readers with irrisistible attraction. 
Patrons of public libraries, especially where the 
open-shelf system prevails, must have noticed how 
seldom the volumes of even Burke's and Webster's 
speeches are missing from their places. And when 
we come to contemporary statesmen, the call for 
their public utterances, printed and bound, is even 
less clamorous. Some of Lincoln's addresses, nota- 
bly his Gettysburg oration (which is not an example 
of political oratory at all), make excellent reading, 
and are read to some extent ; but the ordinary effec- 
tive harangue, however witty and telling it may have 
sounded to its hearers, proves to be woefully un- 
stimulating when read in cold print. The eye is not 
caught by the same tricks that captivate the ear. 
Nevertheless, the publishers of Mr. Winston Spencer 
Churchill, M. P., are planning an issue of some of 
that brilliant parliamentarian's speeches, and the 
volume is likely to contain many clever thoughts 
cleverly expressed ; for this gifted son of a talented 
American mother (and of a distinguished English 
father) has the art of expressing himself both pun- 
gently and picturesquely. But the ordinary reader 
gets all the printed politics he wishes from his daily 
newspaper. ... 

Library activity in the Blue-Grass State 
is displaying new energy, and the hope is cherished 
there that before long a library commission will be 
established and that there will be a rapid increase 
to the now scanty number of free public libraries. 
It is almost twenty years since the first library com- 
mission was appointed, in Massachusetts. The 
country at large soon B caught on " to the idea, and 
since 1890 thirty-two other states have followed the 
good example. Of these, no fewer than eight are 
in the South, and within the present year as many 



as five of our commonwealths — namely, North 
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Illinois — 
have fallen into line with the enlightened and pro- 
gressive majority. At a late meeting of the Ken- 
tucky Educational Association Mr. William F. 
Yust, librarian of the Louisville Public Library, and 
president of the Kentucky Library Association, 
gave an address on ' ; What a Library Commission 
will do for Kentucky." This address, now printed 
(and, we infer, obtainable of Mr. Yust) narrates the 
progress of the library commission movement, and 
tells what those interested are doing and hope to do 
for Kentucky. 

The market value of Meredith manu- 
scripts is indicated by the recent sale of three of 
them to Mr. J. P. Morgan. The autograph manu- 
scripts of " Diana of the Crossways," " Lord 
Ormont and his Aminta," and " An Amazing Mar- 
riage " were secured by Mr. Morgan for eight 
hundred pounds — not a remarkably high price 
compared with that commanded by the manuscripts 
of several of his predecessors in English fiction. A 
Dickens or Thackeray or Scott autograph novel 
would easily bring much more than one of Mere- 
dith's. It was a curious whim of this author to 
leave these literary treasures to an old servant, who 
can hardly have known their value in the market, 
nor have cherished them for their literary excel- 
lence. But he lost little time in converting the bequest 
into cash, and one can only hope that the middle- 
man did not get the lion's share of the shekels. 
What a blessing for this ancient retainer that his 
master did not use a typewriter ! Sad will be the 
lot of autograph-hunters when this machine shall 
have entirely driven out the pen. 

The humbug of de luxe editions has seldom 
been carried to such monstrous absurdity as in a 
recent instance that has caused some stir in the 
book-world of New York. A certain resident of 
that city, more opulent than wise, was persuaded to 
subscribe to a luxurious issue of the works of a 
certain book-writing ex-president of the United 
States, and was to pay sixty-six hundred dollars 
for the magnificently-bound set of volumes. But 
whether the gilt and the tooling were not lavish 
enough, or whether the reading matter proved dis- 
appointing, the fat-pursed and fat-witted subscriber 
demurred at the size of the bill and sought relief in 
the courts. The only comfort, however, that he 
derived from that source took the form of a rather 
caustic observation from the judge to the effect that 
anyone who would pay such a price for the books 
of even the author in question must be an incom- 
petent. . . • 

Washington Irving's escape from law to 
literature forms the subject of a very interesting 
note by Mr. George Haven Putnam, printed in the

arranged to have a desk in the law-office of his 
brother, John Treat Irving. One morning he 
" came into his brother's office actually dancing 
with glee. ' Brother John/ he said, ' here is a fool 
of a publisher willing to pay me a thousand dollars 
a year for doing nothing. I shall not bother myself 
further with the troubles of the law ;' and ... in 
his satisfaction he actually kicked over his desk." 
The " fool of a publisher " was Mr. Putnam's 
father ; and the bargain he made with Irving proved 
highly advantageous to both parties. The house of 
Putnam has rendered distinguished service to the 
cause of letters, but seldom a greater one than in 
recalling Irving from the uncongenial pursuit of the 
law, and saving him to literature. 



FROM LIT ERAR Y LONDON. 

(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
We are now in the very height of the London 
publishing season, and I am sorry to say that so far 
not a single vital book has been added to our liter- 
ature. The book of the moment is Sir Ernest 
Shackleton's work, "The Heart of the Antarctic," 
which is being distributed simultaneously in every 
country in the world. One great London store, — 
and that an American one, for it is owned by Mr. 
Selfridge, — has devoted a window to a display of 
this work, and has draped piles of the volumes with 
flags in a manner that cannot fail to attract notice. 
The two huge volumes will doubtless have a good vogue 
among those who are interested in Polar Exploration. 
Meanwhile extensive negotiations have been going 
on over Commander Peary's book. Rival publishers 
have not shown any great eagerness to pay the large 
sum demanded, the fact being that the unfortunate 
controversy between Commander Peary and Dr. 
Cook has, it is felt, minimized the selling quality of 
Commander Peary's book, which would otherwise 
have received an enormous ovation here. 

The books that are most conspicuous in the ordi- 
nary bookshops in London at this moment are what 
are known as color-books. The invention of the 
three-colored process of printing, and its develop- 
ment by Mr. Carl Hentschel, have been responsible 
for the existence of a wonderful array of these pro- 
ductions. They have usually been books descriptive 
of countries or of cities, such as Venice and Rome. 
I have received four such books on Venice and five 
on Rome, for example ; and a fifth, entitled " The 
Color of Rome," has just reached me. But the 
business of producing illustrated guide-books in 
color seems to be rather overdone, in spite of the 
fact that the demand has been great and the sales 
very remunerative. The color-books of the season 
are now mainly in the realm of imagination. Mr. 
Arthur Rackham, the most popular of our illustra- 
tors in color, this year has five books, of which the 
most beautiful in my eyes is his edition of " Grimm's 
Fairy Tales," published here by the Constables; 



although much is to be said for a translation, by 
that accomplished journalist Mr. W. L. Courtney, 
of Motte-Fouque''s " Undine." There are many 
other books illustrated in color ; for example, there 
are no less than four color books of Shakespeare's 
Plays, issued on both sides of the Atlantic by the 
firm of Hodder & Stoughton, which has now started 
an American business, as your advertisement col- 
umns testify. Booksellers tell me that this firm's 
edition of FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 
with illustrations by Edmund Dulac, is selling here 
the best of all their books. Apart from such works, 
a walk through half a dozen London bookshops 
during this month of November conveys no definite 
impression of literary activity. 

The Omar Khayyam Club of London has just had 
its fiftieth dinner. The Club was started seventeen 
years ago, by a few friends. It limited its members 
to fifty-nine, in consideration of the fact that Edward 
FitzGerald published his great poem in the year 
1859. Now its membership is completed, and it 
has kept up its meetings with amazing vitality. Its 
guests, from year to year, have included nearly all 
the most eminent men of the day. The present 
Prime Minister of England, and the late Mr. John 
Hay, your Ambassador to St. James, have been 
among the guests. A new list of its members has 
just been circulated, and this indicates that all our 
leading writers have retained their membership. 
At our November meeting, Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton 
was one of the wittiest of the speakers. In speak- 
ing of the interest which the Club appropriately took 
in wine, he told us that one of his nonconformist 
friends had assured him that when Christ turned 
water into wine at a marriage feast it was into a 
non-alcoholic beverage. " I cannot imagine," said 
Mr. Chesterton, " any such wilful waste of divine 
power." 

We often hear complaints on this side against the 
American copyright law. It has not given English 
authors all that they hoped for, yet I had a concrete 
example furnished to me the other day of what it 
had done in a branch of literature not usually very 
remunerative — biography. Few more interesting 
series of books have been published in my time than 
Macmillan's " English Men of Letters." The first 
series, it will be remembered, was edited by Mr. 
John Morley, now Lord Morley of Blackburn. It 
included biographies of great writers of the past by 
some of the great writers of the Victorian era. After 
along interval of years, the firm of Macmillan issued 
a " New Series " of the " English Men of Letters," 
but without Lord Morley 's name as editor. It is 
no disparagement of the talent of these younger 
writers to say that they lack the scholarship and in 
many cases the fine qualities of style of their prede- 
cessors. Yet, curiously enough, they received, I am 
told, exactly double the amount for their work ; and 
of this, fifty per cent was due to American copyright, 
the advantages of which came to us in the interval 
between the two series.

How much the English public really loves a lord, 
in spite of the attack upon the House of Peers that 
is now absorbing our attention, may be instanced by 
the treatment of our English newspapers of Lord 
Rosebery. Considered impartially, Lord Rosebery 
is a man of but very moderate talent. His brief 
occupancy of the position of Prime Minister of 
England was a great fiasco. As a writer of books, 
he has not the slightest importance. His " Napoleon : 
The Last Phase " was by no means a brilliant sum- 
mary of the events it recorded. The other day he 
gave a lecture at Lichfield upon Dr. Johnson, in 
which he said the wrong thing at every turn. He 
declared, for example, that Johnson was a typical 
John Bull ; and he spoke contemptuously of " Ras- 
selas." Now we all know that Johnson was not a 
typical John Bull, and that " Rasselas " is an English 
classic. Yet such is the curious sycophancy of 
English journalism that our newspapers take Lord 
Rosebery seriously at every turn ; they praise his 
dull books, and quote his utterances as if they were 
semi-inspired. The other day they were full of the 
fact that he had been down Fleet Street visiting the 
haunts of Dr. Johnson. Now there would be no 
harm whatever in his lordship paying a visit to Fleet 
Street, quite privately, but it was a pity that he 
should have taken two or three newspaper acquaint- 
ances with him. The result was, it was told all over 
the world the next morning that Lord Rosebery had 
dined at the "Cheshire Cheese," in "Wine Office 
Court, Fleet Street ; and thus one more lift is given 
to a fiction already too popular, especially with 
American visitors to London. There is not the 
slightest evidence that Dr. Johnson was ever in the 
" Cheshire Cheese." They will there show you his 
portrait, and a seat with a brass plate telling you 
that here he sat ; but the " Cheshire Cheese " is not 
once mentioned in Boswell's Life of Johnson, and 
there is no good reason why Johnson should have 
visited it any more than fifty other taverns that were 
in these regions in his day. Johnson, like most 
men, had his favorite taverns ; and although I 
should be happy to believe that the " Cheshire 
Cheese " was one of them, I decline to do so upon 
the one existing scrap of evidence. This piece of 
evidence is that of old Silas Redding, who fifty years 
ago declared, when a garrulous old man, that he had 
been informed that Johnson was in the habit of fre- 
quenting this tavern. Johnson's one extant house, 
in Gough Square, Fleet Street, is now used as a type- 
foundry. Its frontage is very much what it was in 
Johnson's day. It would be a fine thing if some 
rich man would buy this house and present it to the 
British nation. It would be excellent to have a 
Johnson Museum in London, in this centre. But 
as far as I am concerned, I am more interested in 
the project of a Johnson statue for London. I want 
it to be of colossal and imposing proportions, and I 
want it to stand looking up Fleet Street, although this 
would involve having its back to the church in which 
Johnson worshipped for many years. In that church 
of St. Clement Danes, they still show you the pew 



in a gallery which the great man was wont to occupy. 
Some day, if ever I have the leisure, I propose to 
get together a strong committee, of names that will 
command respect, and set to work to collect no less 
than £3,000, in order to be able to commission this 
statue. Some of my friends in America may begin 
at once to save up their dollars for this meritorious

COMMUNICA TION. 



SPELLING REFORM AND SCHOLARSHIP. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I should be much troubled if Professor Matthews 
really thought, as intimated in his communication in 
your last issue, that I misrepresented Professor Louns- 
bury. The spelling reform has always been a sort of 
" merry war." My mild jests at the " death rattle " 
and the " epicedium " of the movement may pair off 
with the " acanthology " of jibes at the ignorance of his 
opponents which I collected from Professor Lounsbury's 
pages, and which he doubtless would not wish us to take 
too seriously. It is true, however, that whatever satis- 
faction Professor Lounsbury may profess at the progress 
already accomplished, the general tone of his book is 
that of a prophet denouncing a perverse generation 
which will not receive the gospel. This was obviously 
all that my banter meant. 

I am confident that Professor Lounsbury believes that 
I had not the slightest intention of sneering at his 
scholarship, which is not questioned, and is not confined 
to the history of English spelling. But his argument 
seemed to claim for that special form of scholarship the 
same kind of peremptory authority in this matter that 
we concede to a chemist or a geologist in their special- 
ties. And my rejoinder was, and is, that the cases are 
not parallel. Spelling reform is not and cannot be made 
a matter of pure science, still less of historical English 
philology, especially when its advocates admit that they 
do not hope for a thoroughgoing and scientific reform. 
It involves many nice questions of taste, literary feeling, 
psychology of education, and practical consequences, in 
the decision of which the judgments of all thoughtful 
men, whatever their specialties, are entitled to consider- 
ation — even the opinions of those pariahs, the teachers 
of dead languages. An acquaintance with the past 
vagaries of English orthography is a formidable contro- 
versial weapon against opponents who are naive enough 
to suppose that it has never varied. Professor Louns- 
bury uses it with great skill. But it does not justify 
him in assuming the tone of an expert in mathematics 
or physics addressing himself to laymen. The advisa- 
bility of now confusing the virtually established practice 
of a generation, not to say a century, is not proved by 
descriptions of the confusion that reigned in the past. 
Many things were done in the past that would not be 
considered good precedents now. The necessity for 
knowing the detail of the past history of a question de- 
pends on the logical connection of past and present in 
the given case. In this case it is very slight.

RECOLLECTIONS OF A NONAGENARIAN.* 



Anyone who can look back over three-quarters 
of a century has the satisfaction of knowing that 
he has witnessed in that time more signal achieve- 
ments in the arts and sciences, and in human 
progress generally, than have been effected in all 
the centuries of history before his birth. Mr. 
John Bigelow, who has just completed his ninety- 
second year, may well consider his reminiscences 
sufficiently memorable to deserve publication. 
In three ample volumes, of nearly 2000 pages, 
he gives to the world his." Retrospections of an 
Active Life," from infancy to his retirement, 
in 1867, from the diplomatic service, with a 
half-promise to continue the narrative down to 
the present time if life and strength are spared 
him. 

We owe it to one of Mr. Bigelow's daughters 
that the " Retrospections " were made to include 
the writer's memories of his boyhood, memories 
which she had written down from dictation for 
the benefit of her own child, but which seemed 
to their author unworthy of a wider reading. 
But he acknowledges that his recollection of 
those very early incidents is fuller and clearer 
than of many subsequent and far more import- 
ant events ; and certain it is that he has revived 
those distant days with so much of realism, and 
even of romance, that the earlier chapters of his 
book far excell, in interest for the general reader, 
the subsequent pages with their faithful record 
of public and political affairs that have long since 
ceased to be of the nature of burning issues, and 
can strongly appeal to those only whose mem- 
ories or whose chosen studies invest the facts 
with a living significance. 

Bristol, now Maiden, or Malden-on-Hudson, 
in Ulster County, New York, was Mr. Bigelows 
birthplace, and there he received what he felt to 
be the best part of his education. Twice he went 
away to school, and afterward studied at Trinity 
College (then Washington College), Hartford, 
and at Union College, Schenectady, where he 
took his bachelor's degree ; but the little coun- 
try school at home was, he says, the only edu- 
cational institution where he was " conscious of 
receiving any thorough or conscientious in- 
struction " from his teachers. The American 
college standard in his youth was, as everyone

Bigelow. In three volumes. Illustrated. New York: The

knows, not high. Of the home influences at 
Bristol we learn considerable. A capable, sen- 
sible mother, and a father who successfully con- 
ducted ship-building and farming at the same 
time, and was known as " a good provider," 
reared their children in accordance with early 
New England principles. In the following pas- 
sage the author touches on the religious side of 
this upbringing : 

"I have said that my parents were Presbyterians. 
They were more than that: they were New England 
Presbyterians. They were more than that: they were 
Connecticut Presbyterians, and they meant to be just as 
good as a Connecticut Presbyterian can be. They were 
very strict about keeping the Sabbath. They ordinarily 
commenced their Sabbath Saturday afternoon, and not 
infrequently tried to make us remember that the 
Sabbath had commenced before our half-holiday had 
expired. They were not ascetical at all; on the con- 
trary, they were always cheerful and sensible. They 
had, however, been brought up to distrust the influence 
of worldly pleasures and to estimate the moral efficacy 
of self-denial at a much higher figure than their own — 
or anybody else's — children ever did." 

The book makes it clear that Connecticut 
Presbyterianism did not long meet the spiritual 
demands or answer the insistent queries of this 
child. Of his secular education it has already 
been said that formal instruction constituted no 
great part of it. The libraries, poor enough 
though they were, of the two colleges he attended, 
furnished him far more of intellectual food and 
stimulus than did the class-room exercises, and 
he seems always to have been a voracious and 
retentive reader. After graduation from Union 
College at eighteen, he chose the law for his pro- 
fession, and obtained his legal training chiefly 
in a New York office, there being no law schools 
in those days. But the lure of literature — 
more immediately, of journalism — turned him 
aside from a promising practice in 1849, and he 
became part owner and joint editor, with the 
poet Bryant, of the New York " Evening Post." 
Bryant's influence on the young journalist may 
be judged from the following : 

" In looking back upon my past life, I have been fre- 
quently impressed with a sense of my obligations to the 
superior standards by which I had from time to time 
the privilege of gauging my conduct. For full twenty 
years after my daily intercourse with Mr. Bryant ter- 
minated by my retirement from the Evening Post and 
absence from the country, I would find myself fre- 
quently testing things I had done or proposed to do by 
asking myself, How would Mr. Bryant act under similar 
circumstances ? I rarely applied this test without re- 
ceiving a clear and satisfactory answer. The influence 
which Mr. Bryant exerted over me by his example — 
he never gave advice — satisfies me that everyone 
undervalues the importance of his own example. In 
ordering our own' lives, we are unconsciously ordering

the lives of everybody else; for a wave of influence once 
projected by us never sleeps even when it has washed 
every shore." 

Memories of our great statesmen of the early 
and middle nineteenth century are scattered 
through Mr. Bigelow's volumes. Webster he 
heard speak in 1837 on the condition of the 
country : and he recalls the orator's presence 
of mind in calming an incipient panic in the 
crowded hall by raising his hand to invoke quiet 
and assuring the audience that nothing had 
broken but their own patience and the thread 
of his argument. John Quincy Adams was 
invited by the New York Historical Society to 
deliver an address in celebration of the jubilee 
of Washington's first inauguration, and his dis- 
course, occupying two hours, is regarded by 
Mr. Bigelow as "the most impressive speech" 
he ever heard. It was the matter, not the 
manner, of this scholarly effort that won the 
hearer's favor ; for Adams lacked the eloquence 
of Webster, Everett, and other noted speakers 
of his time. Xaturally enough, there is a good 
deal of political history and reflection mingled 
with these reminiscences of famous statesmen 
and the times in which they lived. Always 
independent in his politics, Mr. Bigelow was a 
Democrat in early life, of the M Barnburner," 
not the " Hunker," variety ; he took an active 
part in the election of Silas Wright to the gov- 
ernorship of New York, and was appointed by 
him an inspector of Sing Sing Prison, where he 
helped to effect some much-needed reforms. He 
joined the Free-Soil movement, worked for 
Fremont's election to the presidency, and even 
wrote a campaign life of that unsuccessful can- 
didate. 

In the autumn of 1858 Mr. Bigelow went 
with his family to Europe for a nineteen-months 
sojourn, and he devotes a long and most inter- 
esting chapter to what he did and saw and 
heard in France, Italy, and England. His 
deliberately-formed opinion of Gladstone, as 
recorded in his diary, is noteworthy. 

" I think it will be found that Mr. Gladstone's power, 
like the late Daniel Webster's, consists more in his 
skill in using material than in his ability to provide it; 
that he is a manufacturer rather than a producer, and 
his wonderful faculty of clothing and adorning an idea 
or doctrine that has been put into his hands has tempted 
him to the publication of a great deal of learned non- 
sense, which would never have seen the light if he had 
anything like the same capacity for discovering truths 
that he has for propagating them when discovered. . . . 
But as a member of the Government he has been 
brought into contact with and partially into a state of 
dependence upon the Liberal party, who are counselled 
by two or three of the most ingenious and philosophic 



politicians in England. They supply him with ideas, 
and he is fascinated by the scope afforded his resources 
for their development and propagation." 

Soon after returning from Europe, Mr. 
Bigelow severed his connection with the " Even- 
ing Post " in order to devote himself to literary 
pursuits more attractive to him than journalism. 
The immediate project on which he had fixed 
his mind was a biography of Fenelon ; but more 
urgent claims appear to have engrossed his 
attention, and the book on the Archbishop of 
Cambray remained unwritten. The appoint- 
ment as Consul-General at Paris, followed in 
three years by promotion to a higher office in 
the same capital — that of Minister to France — 
together with the distractions of the Civil War, 
may well have upset any prearranged plans. 
Mr. Bigelow's eminent service to his country in 
defeating the Confederate scheme for having 
a navy built in France, with the French Em- 
peror's sanction or connivance, has long been a 
matter of history, and the full account of the 
affair may be read in his book, " France and 
the Confederate Navy.*' That our country had 
at Paris, in that critical time, so loyal, so alert, 
and so thoroughly capable a man to guard its 
interests, was indeed fortunate. 

The " Retrospections," as they proceed, give 
place more and more to the author's wide and 
highly interesting correspondence with public 
men of distinction — that is, to their letters, 
only a few of Mr. Bigelow's being printed. 
Especially full and frequent are the letters 
from Charles Sumner, an intimate and valued 
friend. One trait of Sumner's, a very human 
weakness, the author takes occasion to note. 

" Sumner cannot bear to have anyone talk as though 
anything could be found in books about literature and 
literary men that he did not know. I have seen him 
snap up poor Bemis, one of his satellites, and Mr. 
Lyman also, in a most ferocious way, for attempting to 
quote a book to him, as if he did not know it already. 
Indeed, such are the only occasions in my long acquaint- 
ance with him when he has ever appeared unamiable. 
But he was then an invalid of a kind that excuses 
everything." 

Of Lincoln, whom the author warmly ad- 
mired and energetically supported, he thus 
records his impressions : 

" He seemed to me, nor was it in the least strange that 
he did, like a man utterly unconscious of the space which 
the President of the L'nited States occupied that day in 
the history of the human race, and of the vast power 
for the exercise of which he had become personally 
responsible. This impression was strengthened by Mr. 
Lincoln's modest habit of disclaiming knowledge of 
affairs and familiarity with duties, and frequent avowals 
of ignorance, which, even where it exists, it is well for 



448

a captain as far as possible to conceal from the public. 
. . . Lincoln's greatness must be sought for in the con- 
stituents of his moral nature. He was so modest by 
nature that he was perfectly content to walk behind any 
man who wished to walk before him. I do not know 
that history has made a record of the attainment of any 
corresponding eminence by any other man who so habit- 
ually, so constitutionally, did to others as he would have 
them do to him. ... St. Paul hardly endured more 
indignities and buffetings without complaint." 

Mr. Bigelow's almost life-long intimacy with 
Tilden, whose literary and financial executor he 
finally became, his activity in establishing the 
New York Public Library on its broad-based 
Astor, Lenox, and Tilden foundations, his mani- 
fold public services rendered and numerous 
offices held, his literary work, and many other 
matters, must be left to the book itself, and to 
its hoped-for sequel, to disclose. If a fault is 
prominent in his work, it lies in his too modest 
suppression of himself in favor of his many 
illustrious correspondents. More of his own 
way of looking at things, and less of his friends' 
epistolary account of them, would have been 
welcome. He even carries this complaisance so 
far in one place as to devote forty pages of fine 
print to a translation of Montalembert's essay 
on " The Triumph of the Union," and the three 
volumes together contain far less of his own 
writing than of his friends'. The result, in the 
bulk and cost of the work, is not eminently sat- 
isfactory. Of the author's easy and unstudied 
literary style, little need here be said. Its easi- 
ness is perhaps sometimes carried a bit too far 
in that familiar form of expression known to rhe- 
toricians as " construction according to sense." 
In so voluminous a work misprints and slips of 
the pen are to be expected, and are found. One 
curious error, if it be an error, puzzles the reader. 
Describing a ball at Buckingham Palace, the 
author writes, or the printer prints : " I had the 
satisfaction of seeing Lord Lytton and Disraeli 
among the onlookers — the only well of literary 
eminence present that I recognized." Is this a 
veiled and far-fetched allusion to Spenser's « well 
of English undefyled," or is it only a misprint 
of well for men f In another place, where the 
famous marbles collected by the Marquis of 
Campana are under discussion, the Italian word 
marchese is repeatedly used as equivalent to 
marchioness, and vice versa. The many por- 
traits and other illustrations in the book pleas- 
antly arrest the reader's attention, and in general 
(barring the almost unavoidable minimum of 
minor blemishes) the work is a credit to all con- 
cerned in its production.

Farthest South.* 



When the future historian writes his account 
of Arctic and Antarctic explorations, he will put 
down the year 1909 as the annus mirabilis. 
He will record the discovery of the North Pole 
and of the South Magnetic Pole ; he will recount 
how the finding of the South Pole dwindled to 
a paltry tantalizing century of miles ; and if the 
Charcot Expedition, which has been in the South 
Polar regions for two years, and from which some 
news is daily expected, is successful, he will end 
his chapter by telling how the two great white 
spots on the globe, which for over a century 
have lured explorers to victory or to death, have 
been placed, like Keats's scientific rainbow, in 
the dull catalogue of common things. And, not 
least in his history of this wonderful year of 
Polar research and discovery, he will place the 
account of the British Antarctic Expedition led 
by Lieutenant Ernest H. Shackleton. Though 
Lieutenant Shackleton did not reach the coveted 
spot, he came within a hundred miles of it, and 
his party has the honor of having located the 
South Magnetic Pole. To that list of worthies 
who since 1773 have been sailing farther and 

farther south in search of the ultimate degree, 

Captain James Cook, von Bellingshausen, Wed- 
dell, Balleny, Wilkes, Ross, and Borchgrevink, 
— must be added the name of the persistent 
young Englishman who has furthered our knowl- 
edge about the vast waste places beyond the 
Southern Cross, and has pushed human endur- 
ance to the uttermost that his end might be 
attained. 

Lieutenant Shackleton 's two massive volumes 
entitled "The Heart of the Antarctic" are 
conveniently divided. The first volume relates 
the story of the expedition ; the second records 
the various scientific data gathered by the ex- 
plorers. These data, narrating what was done in 
the domains of geology, biology, magnetism, 
meteorology, and physics, will have but little 
interest for the reader who is more concerned 
with the manner of getting the material than he 
is with the matter itself. Of the manner — the 
heroic efforts and the almost Promethean suf- 
fering of the men who made the remarkable 
journey — the first volume is sufficient for the 
most greedy lover of a tale of daring-do. The

author is one of those venturesome spirits who, 
called by a keen thirst for scientific knowledge, 
by a love of adventure, and by the " lure of 
little voices," is fitted by nature to seek " the 
mysterious fascination of the unknown." More- 
over, Lieutenant Shackleton has known these 
alluring regions since 1901, when he accom- 
panied Lieutenant Scott on the notable " Dis- 
covery " expedition. Unfortunately, however, 
the author was invalided before the mission was 
ended ; but his experience awakened in him a 
keen desire to outdo the efforts of his comman- 
der and to lead his own party into the land 
beyond the limits of the Great Ice Barrier 
plain. His story of his effort is peculiarly his 
own. Though the account of the final dash for 
the South Pole makes up but a bare fourth 
part of the book, it is impressive in its very 
roughness, for the author wrote it daily under 
almost inconceivable conditions, and publishes 
it without rubbing off a particle of the " rust 
that rather adorns and preserves " the original 
story. 

Much of the first volume recounts the prepar- 
ations made for the undertaking. These seem- 
ingly minor details make for a general interest 
in reading the book, for the reader soon sees that 
even the slightest oversight may mar the work 
of months or undermine the outcome of the 
general result. When the reader is finally 
launched on the " Nimrod," however, and is in 
winter quarters at McMurdo Sound, he finds 
himself in the heart of the book. Here, in 1908, 
one division of the party ascended the volcanic 
Mount Erebus and surveyed its various craters. 

" In the spring and summer of 1908-9 three sledging- 
parties left winter quarters ; one went south and attained 
the most southerly latitude ever reached by man, another 
reached the South Magnetic Pole for the first time, and 
a third surveyed the mountain ranges west of McMurdo 
Sound." 

The main result of the southern sledge-journey 
was that the party ascertained that 

■ A great chain of mountains extends from the 82nd 
parallel, south of McMurdo Sound, to the 86th parallel, 
trending in a south-easterly direction; that other great 
mountain ranges continue to the south and south-west, 
and that between them flows one of the largest glaciers 
in the world, leading to an inland plateau, the height of 
which, at latitude 88° South, is over 11,000 feet above 
sea level. This plateau presumably continues beyond 
the geographical South Pole, and extends from Cape 
Andre to the Pole." 

The Great Ice Barrier is still a mystery, but 
Lieutenant Shackleton concluded from his ob- 
servations that it is composed mainly of snow. 
The " Northern Party " of the expedition, in 
addition to discovering the Magnetic Pole, cor- 



rected the existing map of Victoria Land. The 
results obtained by the " Western Party " seem 
to be of minor importance. 

The view of Mount Erebus from the 
Nimrod 's winter quarters is unequalled by any 
Arctic sight. These vivid glows from the vol- 
cano, with "the huge steam column that rises 
from the crater into the cold air shot up at times 
to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet before spread- 
ing out and receiving its line direction from the 
air-currents," and with the moon rising in the 
eastern sky so that the column " projected on 
the disc of the moon, with the great cloud 
travelling upward, not quietly, but impelled by 
force from below," must be a view that would 
encourage only the artists of the Titanic. This 
part of the expedition, aside from its scientific 
aspects, apparently impressed the party as the 
most stupendously grand and picturesque sight 
in the Antarctic land. 

The " Southern Party," with Lieutenant 
Shackleton in command, began its southward 
march on October 29, and returned to quarters 
March 4, with the terse report " We have done 
our best." For this part of the task the most 
careful preparations had been made. The much 
advertised automobile was found impracticable, 
the wheels sinking to the body of the car and 
making progress impossible. Instead of the 
usual outfit of dogs, the author had procured 
eight Siberian ponies, trusting that their hardi- 
ness would withstand the rigors of the far South, 
and in case of shortage of food they would not 
be unacceptable as meat. Four of the animals 
soon succumbed, and the other four were par- 
tially disabled. Hence the final stage of the 
journey was made by man-power. On Novem- 
ber 26 the party passed the " farthest South " 
previously reached by man. Here Lieutenant 
Shackleton makes this impressive entry : 

" It falls to the lot of few men to view land not pre- 
viously seen by human eyes, and it was with feelings of 
keen curiosity, not unmingled with awe, that we watched 
the new mountains rise from the great unknown that lay 
ahead of us. Mighty peaks they were, the eternal snows 
at their bases, and their rough-hewn forms rising high 
towards the sky. As the days wore on, and mountain 
after mountain came into view, grimly majestic, the con- 
sciousness of our insignificance seemed to grow upon us. 
We were but tiny black specks crawling slowly and 
painfully across the white plain, and bending our puny 
strength to the task of wresting from nature secrets 
preserved inviolate through all the ages." 

On January 9 the party spent its last day 
outwards. 

" We have shot our bolt, and the tale is latitude 88° 
23 / South. ... At 4 A. M. we started south, with the 
Queen's Union Jack, a brass cylinder containing stamps

and documents to place at the furthest south point, 
camera, glasses, and compass. At 9 A. M. we were 
half running and half walking over a surface much 
hardened by the recent blizzard. We hoisted her 
Majesty's flag and the other Union Jack afterwards, 
and took possession of the plateau in the name of his 
Majesty. . . . There was no break in the plateau as it 
extended toward the Pole, and we feel sure that the 
goal we have failed to reach lies on this plain. We 
stayed only a few minutes, and then, taking the Queen's 
flag and eating our scanty meal as we went, we hurried 
back. . . . Homeward bound at last. Whatever re- 
grets may be, we have done our best." 

Lieutenant Shackleton's account of the gnaw- 
ing hunger endured by the men when on their 
southern trip makes one of the most intense bits 
of reading in the book. " During the last weeks 
of the journey outward," he writes, " and the long 
march back, when our allowance of food had 
been reduced to 20 ounces per man a day, we 
really thought of little but food." Could the 
explorers have satisfied their hunger with their 
eyes, by viewing the crude though wondrously 
beautiful color-schemes of the Antarctic, they 
would have been fully satisfied. Marston, the 
artist of the expedition, places the colors before 
us in startling combinations. 

" Bright blues and greens are seen in violent contrast 
with brilliant reds ; and an accurate record of the colors 
displayed in a sunset, as seen over broken ice, would 
suggest to many people an impressionistic poster of the 
kind seen in the London streets. Words fail one in an 
attempt to describe the wildly bizarre effects observed 
on days when the sky was fiery red and pale green, 
merging into a deep blue overhead, and the snow-fields 
and rocks showed violet, green and white under the 
light of the moon." 

These almost unearthly landscapes are repro- 
duced with remarkable effect in the color-plates 
of the book. To speak of them in detail, or of 
the many wonderful photogravures, and the inter- 
esting maps and charts, is not necessary here. 
The mechanical features of the volumes are dig- 
nified and pleasing, as befits the impressive and 
thrilling character of the narrative. No one 
reading it will question its author's title to a 
place in the ranks of the Great Explorers.

Mr. James and Mr. Pennell in Italy.* 



Certainly there is no book among those issued 
for this holiday season prouder in its garb, yet 
clothed in perfect taste, than the volume of 
" Italian Hours," by Mr. Henry James, printed 
at the Riverside Press. From the moment one 
glances at the rich cover, with its decoration 

* Italian Hours. By Henry James. With illustrations

suggestive of Italian mosaic, one is sure of this 
much at least : a feast for the eyes. Neither 
the publishers, who provide the unexcelled 
printing for which they have a reputation, nor 
the illustrator, who produced the original crayon 
drawings from which the thirty-two full-page 
pictures are reproduced in color, disappoints 
one's expectations. Frankly, we like better 
the earlier styles of illustration associated with 
Mr. Pennell's name. We cherish even to-day 
a livelier enthusiasm for his drawings and 
etchings in black-and-white. Yet his colors 
command excellent effects, and we turn the 
pages here with vivid interest. The " Colon- 
nade of St. Peter's, Rome " conveys admirably 
the due impression of sweep and space ; the 
charm of romantic distances is not lacking in 
his "Castel Gandolfo." Mr. Pennell renders 
something of the grandeur of the Perugian 
prospect, and very much of the massive beauty 
of an Etruscan gateway to that wonderful little 
city. The pictures much more than justify 
themselves as glosses of the text by Mr. James. 
And if the illustrations most handsomely com- 
plement the text, nothing could be more appro- 
priate than the stateliness of the book as a 
whole — the dignified page, the fair paper, the 
wide margins. Of these mechanical details it is 
impossible not to take note ; yet one prefers not 
to insist upon them. They are not calculated 
to distract one's attention from the printed 
word : only to dignify that word. That is as it 
should be, in good book-making. 

" Italian Hours " consists of a collection of 
some score of travel-papers composed in the 
years 1872-1909. Most of the essays seem to 
belong to the seventies and eighties. " The 
chapters of which this volume is composed have 
with few exceptions already been collected, and 
were then associated with others commemorative 
of other impressions of (no very extensive) ex- 
cursions and wanderings," writes Mr. James in 
his preface. Thus the reader will recognize the 
opening chapter on Venice, and a later one en- 
titled " Italy Revisited," as hailing from that 
familiar volume published twenty-five years ago 
in Boston, " Portraits of Places." The novelty 
of the present volume consists in the fact that 
" the notes on various visits to Italy are here for 
the first time exclusively placed together," to 
quote, once more, the preface. " I have not 
hesitated to amend my text, expressively," the 
traveller adds. There has, however, been little 
attempt to bring the chapters " down to date," 
unless it be in the addition of papers recording 
later impressions. This is not a substitute for

Baedeker : " The fond appeal of the observer 
concerned is all to aspects and appearances — 
above all to the intimate face of things as it 
mainly used to be." 

So many of these Italian hours are given to 
Venice, there can be no great harm in the re- 
viewer's almost neglecting the rest, which the 
reader will not fail to enjoy for himself. We 
wish to quote a few sentences from the first 
chapter of all, dated 1882. This is not the first 
chapter in point of time, however. " An Early 
Impression " is of ten years' older vintage. Mr. 
James writes thus of Venice in 1882 : 

" Everyone has been there: it is not forbidden how- 
ever to speak of familiar things. There is nothing new 
to be said about her certainly, but the old is better than 
any novelty. It would be a sad day indeed when there 
should be something new to say. ... 1 do not pretend 
to enlighten the reader; I pretend only to give a fillip 
to his memory." 

Mr. James is too modest in this self-judgment. 
With more space available, it would be a grate- 
ful excercise to copy here some of his " certain 
little mental pictures." As it is, one need only 
observe that nothing can be much more interest- 
ins: to the amateur of Jacobean literature than 
to read one impression after another, to note the 
enthusiasm of that dated 1872 (with its state- 
ment about " the mere use of one's eyes " being 
happiness enough), and the circumstance that 
the later James is one for whom Gautier's 
" visible world " is far from being adequate, in 
any literary sense. " Dear old Venice," he 
writes in 1899, " has lost her complexion, her 
figure, her reputation, her self-respect, and yet, 
with it all, has so puzzlingly not lost a shred of 
her attraction."' The "certain little mental 
pictures " become increasingly technical, increas- 
ingly complex : that much is certain. 

One of the anecdotes of Mr. Meredith which 
went the rounds at the time of his death, not so 
many months ago that the anecdote itself can 
be forgotten, is his remark upon the younger 
author's book, " The American Scene." " I 
enjoyed it immensely," said Mr. Meredith, or 
words to that effect. " But it is not really an 
' American scene ' at all : only a most delightful 
tour of Henry James's insides." One does not 
quite wish to apply the criticism to the present 
volume, and yet — when the time comes to 
evaluate these travel-sketches of a subtler sort, 
one is prompted to quote, without consciousness 
of malice, one of Mr. James's own sentences, 
occurring in " Roman Neighbourhoods." " The 
great thing in art is charm, and the great thing 
in charm is spontaneity." The dictum which 
the man of letters applies as a test of Domeni- 



chino's painting might indubitably be applied, 
with meet reverence, to his own prose. " Spon- 
taneity ": the word is a good one ; the thing 
itself is excellent. Perhaps it is more than one 
has a right to ask from so masterly an analyst 
of men and of places.

The Ships and Sailors of Old Salem.* 

There is still magic in the name of the old 
city of Salem, once the commercial emporium of 
New England, now the outpost of summer villas 
of merchant princes, following the windings 
of the coast from Marblehead to Bar Harbor. 
The lover of romance associates it with "The 
House of the Seven Gables," the birthplace of 
its author, and the Custom House where in the 
interims of signing invoices and bills of lading he 
conceived the scheme of " The Scarlet Letter." 
The student of popular frenzies of superstition 
finds rich material in that wave of witchcraft 
which swept over Salem Village, and wonders 
why Cotton Mather and Judge Sewall did not 
recommend a vigorous application of the strap 
as a corrective of juvenile animosity towards 
estimable old ladies, instead of swallowing their 
absurd stories of pin-pricking, broom-riding, and 
evil-eye fixing. The lover of sane architecture 
still delights in studying the impressive colonial 
mansions, with their stately doorways and old- 
fashioned gardens which are among the most 
attractive features of the sedate old city. The 
musician recalls that Billings wrote the first 
American composition in his Salem tannery and 
chalked the notes of " Majesty *' on the hides, 
and that General Oliver scored his " Coronation" 
there, little dreaming that the Christian world 
long after his death would rejoice in its exultant 
strains. Scientist and sailor have preserved the 
memory of the Salem Bowditch who first reduced 
navigation to an exact science and whose work 
is still the vade mecum of mariners the world 
over. The name of Salem recalls to the histo- 
rian its Puritan settlement only eight years after 
the Pilgrim settlement of Plymouth colony, its 
glorious place in Revolutionary annals, and the 
romantic stories of lords and ladies who thronged 
the baronial mansion on Folly Hill, of dignified 
colonial governors, of Crowinshield mysteries 
and Derby exploits, of dames' school teachers, 
"marms" who sold molasses candy and the

famous iron pears baked in New Orleans mo- 
lasses, and of the reduced noble lady who re- 
trieved her fortunes by the invention and sale 
of " Black Jacks " and " Gibraltar s," of which 
Hawthorne was so fond, and which are still to 
be obtained of her descendants in Salem streets. 
To the collectors of " antiques " the name sug- 
gests blue willow-ware and Chippendales, shell 
sugar-bowls and lustre pitchers, venerable 
high-boys, four-posters, and davenports, the 
private treasures in old garrets and public treas- 
ures in the East India Museum and in Essex 
Institute. 

Salem thus presents diversified interests, 
according to the mood of the visitor ; but it has 
been reserved for Mr. Ralph D. Paine, mousing 
among the dusty archives, to present Salem from 
its most fascinating point of view and one not 
generally considered and mostly forgotten. He 
has recalled in his book, " The Ships and Sailors 
of Old Salem," the crowning glory of the North 
Shore outpost, — for Salem ships and sailors, 
traversing uncharted seas in quest of gain and 
opening up new marts of trade, bringing honor 
to the flag in open naval engagement, or swoop- 
ing down upon the enemy and devastating him 
in privateer attack, sum up its greatest achieve- 
ments in commerce and romance, enterprise and 
heroism. It was Salem that first sent the 
American ensign into distant unexplored waters 
— to Japan, China, the Philippines, Guam, 
Sumatra, Arabia, the African coast, the Cape 
of Good Hope, the islands of the South Seas 
if not of all Kipling's seven seas. It is fortu- 
nate that Salem institutions have preserved the 
records of these achievements, but it is more 
fortunate still that Mr. Paine conceived the 
idea of ransacking dusty shelves and dingy 
chests, and securing these fascinating stories 
and making them public before they were de- 
faced by time or their hiding-places were for- 
gotten. His skilful hands have done the work 
well. He does not intrude himself unnecessa- 
rily upon the reader, but introduces the old 
pioneers of maritime adventure and lets the 
skippers and their crews tell their own stories 
in their own unvarnished way. And what 
marvellous yarns they spin ! Again truth is 
stranger than fiction. It is not necessary to 
go to Marryat, Dana, Connolly, or Jacobs, for 
" thrillers " of the sea. Their sea-pictures of 
the fancy are outdone by these broad glowing 
canvases upon which the old captains, priva- 
teers, and pirates too, have told their stories. 
As the author says, " The materials for the plot 
of a modern novel of adventure may be found 



condensed into a three-line entry of many an 
ancient log-book." 

The maritime story of Salem is an epic, and 
one of the most interesting in American history ; 
for Mr. Paine's volume is not alone a study in 
Salem records, it is a valuable contribution 
to the national history. These journals, logs, 
and documents of the sturdy old captains not 
merely show what an important part they 
played in the commercial development of the 
whole country and in defence of the flag at 
their mast-heads, they are tales of high adven- 
ture, romances of the sea, short stories which 
may be solidly enjoyed by all who love the 
ocean — and who have not at some time longed 
for a " life on the ocean wave " and a " home 
on the rolling deep"? It is a bulky epic of 
thirty-one cantos and over six hundred pages, 
richly illustrated with cuts and facsimiles ; but 
no one need be deterred from reading by its 
length. It is a human document of entrancing 
interest. In these chapters Mr. Paine and his 
old sea-dogs tell the stories of those match- 
less clippers whose sails flecked every sea, and 
with whose disappearance the ocean has lost 
something of its picturesqueness ; of battles 
fought with the pirates of the Spanish Main ; 
of the privateers of 1776 and 1812, who so 
materially reduced the naval strength of Great 
Britain ; of the pioneers of distant seas ; of the 
old frigate Essex, which Salem shipbuilders 
gave to the government, and which fought so 
gallantly for " free-trade and sailors' rights "; 
of the first voyages to Japan ; of the first arrival 
of an American ship at Guam, our accidental and 
serio-comic possession ; of Nathaniel Bowditch 
and his" Practical Navigator"; of South Sea voy- 
ages ; and of the romantic career of Frederick 
Townsend Ward, the young Salem soldier who 
became a Chinese mandarin. And to these Mr. 
Paine has added the logs and diaries of such 
famous ship-masters as Bertram, Russell, Derby, 
Crowninshield, Little, Silsbee, Cleveland, and 
others, interesting sidelights on Endicott and 
Hawthorne, and appendixed historical docu- 
ments of great value. 

They were a hardy, robust, heroic lot, these 
old skippers, with something of the Puritan 
spirit manifesting itself in their remorseless dis- 
cipline and sometimes harsh treatment of those 
who fell into their hands or were not prompt in 
obedience. But they played an important part 
in upbuilding Salem when New York and Boston 
were hardly known on the seas, and in main- 
taining the honor of the flag. There are still 
remnants of the old ships in Salem harbor, and

the warehouses which were piled with Salem's 
wealth in the old days, though rotting away, still 
stand on Salem wharves as if gazing out at sea 
and wondering why the old clippers are no longer 
rounding up from the under-world and heading 
to their doors with their treasure ; but the story 
of its achievements and of its pristine glory has 
been preserved by Mr. Paine in permanent 
form and told in masterly fashion. There are 
few more engaging books for a winter evening 
around the fire than this record of " the brave

The Old New York axd the New.* 



It is natural that the year of the Hudson- 
Fulton celebration should yield a full crop of 
books about New York. The great city stopped 
to take breath and consider its historic past ; 
the rest of the country went down to help the 
New Yorkers make holiday. And the canny 
publisher noted the chance to be timely, to con- 
vert the quickened interest in New York, Dutch 
and American, into a market for his wares. 
Three at least of these recent books about New 
York are of a character to appeal strongly to 
the holiday book-buyer, searching for something 
worth while in substance and attractive in ap- 
pearance to bestow upon his friends. 

The first of them is a faithful study of the 
manners and customs of the Dutch founders of 
New York, so entertainingly misrepresented by 
Washington Irving and rather neglected since 
his day. Miss Esther Singleton brings to her 
latest research a valuable background of related 
information ; for she has already written a book 
about Dutch and Flemish furniture, and an 
interesting account of " Social New York under 
the Georges." Her " Dutch New York " fairly 
bristles with facts, documentary evidence, curi- 
ous details culled from inventories, letters, and 
legal records ; but they are all characteristic 
and interesting, logically arranged and suc- 
cinctly related, so that they hold attention. 
Miss Singleton has very little to say of the 
geography of old New York, and not much of 
its commercial relations ; it is the e very-day life 
of the transplanted Dutch burghers that she

tries to reconstruct. They were just that, she 
explains ; bringing with them to their new 
homes all their native customs and cherished 
possessions, — their massive " Kasten," with 
Delft and porcelain and silver to fill them, 
their voluminous and numerous petticoats and 
baggy breeches, their big ruffs and jewelled 
head-dresses, Great and Little Masters to hang 
on their walls, even tulips and hyacinths to 
plant in their gardens. 

The very earliest settlers, of course, enjoyed 
no such luxuries. Miss Singleton devotes a 
preliminary chapter to their experiences, mostly 
taken verbatim from letters and diaries. A 
chapter on " New Amsterdam Housekeeping " 
details the daily life of the women, thoroughly 
old-world in its laborious devotion to cleanli- 
ness. There is also a chapter on servants, who 
certainly had a rough time of it in New Am- 
sterdam, in spite of all the law could do in their 
defence ; and one on education, flattering neither 
to schools, masters, nor pupils. Religion re- 
ceives due attention, as do the curious and elabo- 
rate marriage customs which contrast oddly 
with traditions of Dutch thrift. One of the 
longest chapters in the text, and the majority of 
the illustrations, are devoted to the Dutch fur- 
niture. There are also several reproductions of 
old prints and of the paintings of the period. 
A handsome photogravure of Mayor Cornelius 
Steenwyck forms an appropriate frontispiece. 

There are plenty of books about modern New 
York, but " The New New York " stands out 
among them, distinguished by the personality 
of both author and illustrator. Dr. John C. 
Van Dyke is an able and eminent art-critic, 
while his wonderful study of " The Desert " 
suggests more definitely what he will do here. 
Mr. Joseph Pennell's position as etcher and 
illustrator needs no comment, and some of his 
best work has had New York for its subject. 
For " The New New York " he has made a 
hundred sketches in black-and-white, and two 
dozen or so in pastel. These last are far less 
effective than the uncolored drawings ; the 
method seems ill-adapted to most of the sub- 
jects chosen. But at least they add variety, — 
and surely variety is one of the chief qualities 
in any true picture of the new New York. In 
his preface, Dr. Van Dyke thus states the 
point of view agreed upon between author and 
illustrator as most significant : the representing 
of "the life and energy of its people projected 
upon the background of its commerce. ' In 
other words, they find New York interesting 
because it " just grew," and is still growing ;

[Dec. 1, 



because it is essentially busy, hurried, crowded 
— a tremendous commercial force, with sky- 
scrapers, bridges, tunnels, all on a vast and 
magnificent scale commensurate with its power 
and vitality. This thesis is brilliantly elabo- 
rated in an introductory chapter. There follows 
one entitled " Seasonal Impressions," full of 
subtle understanding of color, material and 
spiritual. Some of the other chapters are not 
as good. The impression made by a city is far 
more complex than that of a desert. Some- 
times Dr. Van Dyke loses his way in New York. 
We are reminded of a statement in Mr. G. W. 
Steevens's "The Land of the Dollar": "The 
truth is that New York yields no impression. 
... It dazzles and it astonishes, but it does 
not make a picture." Certainly it does not 
always make a picture for Dr. Van Dyke. 
Sometimes it generalizes itself into any city ; 
for example, much of the chapter on " Shops 
and Shopping " would apply equally well to 
London or Chicago. Often, too, a little picture 
is heavily framed in vague generalization. 

" It is usually a more well-to-do class of people seated 
in the carriages and cabs than walks upon the side-walk, 
and perhaps it represents fashion or society better, since 
neither of them cares much for going about on foot in 
New Fork." 

One loses interest in a paragraph beginning with 
so obvious a statement, but Dr. Van Dyke has a 
bad habit of beginning paragraphs in that way. 
We wish that he had been more consistently the 
artist, and less the omnivorous observer, con- 
scientiously attempting to absorb everything that 
New York has to show him. But if occasionally 
" The New New York " strikes the level of mere 
information, as a whole it moves on a much 
higher plane, forming a significant, if over- 
weighted, impression of our New World metro- 
polis, with its unique conception of municipal 
beauty, realized and to be realized in years to 
come — for the new New York is still very much 
in the making. 

Last in our present group, we have " The 
Wayfarer in New York," a small but very com- 
prehensive anthology, with a sprightly essay from 
Mr. Edward S. Martin, deftly contrived to put 
the reader in the mood for enjoying the extracts 
— whether or not compiled by Mr. Martin is 
not indicated. These are grouped geographi- 
cally, under headings named fr6m the different 
quarters of the city ; and, roughly speaking, 
chronologically, for they run from the Battery 
progressively to the Bronx, — that is, from the 
old New York to the new. The compiler, who- 
ever he be, has appreciated the fact that de- 



scription, however picturesque, palls, and has 
made human interest the basis of his selection. 
The result is a vivid panorama of city life as 
our novelists, poets, newspaper reporters, histo- 
rians, and other " wayfarers " have interpreted 
it, with many intentions and in varying mood.

The Charm of China.* 



In writing a book on China, Mr. William 
Edgar Geil was wise in concentrating upon what 
has always been the great mystery of China — 
its Great Wall. This mystery Mr. Geil explored 
in the spirit of one profoundly impressed with 
his subject. There are times when he is almost 
lyrical in what he writes of this more than tenth 
wonder of the world, — for in his interpretation 
it is really more wonderful than all the " nine 
wonders " together. He has not attempted 
a sober scientific treatment of his subject, — 
although his pages reveal no lack of scholarly 
equipment, abundant accumulation of material, 
and a first-hand acquaintance with Chinese lit- 
erature. He has chosen, rather, to blend his 
material into a narrative imbued with the charm 
of a fervid and enthusiastic style. The result is 
a dramatic and highly entertaining book. The 
author made the entire journey over the Great 
Wall, and his readers share in his admiration of 
its extent, its circuitousness, and the numberless 
interesting details of its origin and history. 
Thus " The Great Wall " becomes almost per- 
sonified as the hero of a wonderful tale, and its 
builder, China, is individualized as some one of 
vast importance and achievement. He exalts 
them, indeed, into a sort of epic dignity. " The

rhapsodic phrase, " extends from the Yellow Sea 
past the Yellow Kiver to the Yellow Sand, and 
thence on to the Big White Water. From the

when looking westward. And many considera- 
tions pass through the mind. Will the Yellows 
go to the Whites and submerge them ? Will it 
be from Yellow to White ; or will it be that the 
White will become Yellow and that these people 
will ultimately predominate? Most of our 
thoughts, as we rode toward beautiful Kiayiikan, 
were about the movements of nations. We 
thought in empires." Mr. Geil's thoughts are 
indeed spacious, and though he does not make 
the Great Wall particularly a vantage-ground 
from which to speculate upon the future of the 
Chinese, he does hint that its vastness, even in 
decay, speaks of a people whose power has never 
slept. 4 * Once the Great Barrier had three mil- 
lions of soldiery behind it. Suppose these came 
once again to man the towers, with Maxims on 
the turrets and seige guns behind the Wall! 
Who would dare attack ? But suppose they 
march forward, who can defend ? " Mention 
must be made of the pictures, which are so num- 
erous and so truly illustrative that they are in 
themselves a vivid presentation of this more than 
vivid book. 

The charm of China is as potent now as ever 
to inspire books on the wonders, the mysteries, 
the anomalies, and the surprises of that far- 
eastern land. In Miss (or Mrs.) E. G. Kemp's 
handsome work entitled M The Face of China " 
we have the impressions and observations of a 
wide-awake and rather courageous woman who 
has twice journeyed through the central prov- 
inces, and has thrown herself on the courtesy 
and chivalry of the natives without finding her 
confidence misplaced. The soul of the far East 
she leaves it to others to study, and. if they 
«/an, to reproduce: while she is content, as she 
says, to set down faithfully the things she has 
seen, and thus perhaps induce some of her 
readers to visit the country for themselves. 
Also, as her title-page tells us, she gives rt some 
account of the new schools, universities, mis- 
sions, and the old religious sacred places of 
Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism." Most 
interesting and praiseworthy is China's immense 
respect for education, even for its own pedantic 
system, and still more so its now growing esteem 
for Western learning. The marvellous com- 
petitive examinations for scholarly rank and 
title — physical endurance tests they ought 
rather to be called — are described by the au- 
thor, who has herself inspected the cells where 
the aspirants for honors suffer and even die 
in the three-days and nine-days intellectual 
combats. Cheerfully bright pictures of many 
colors, varied with sepia drawings, all of decided 



artistic merit, are supplied with lavish hand, 
and render still more attractive a very invit- 
ing book. A glaringly misquoted line from 
Browning is the only slip of the pen we have 
discovered. 

Mr. Mortimer Menpes has provided drawings 
— sixteen elaborately colored, and sixty-four in 
black and white — for one of his handsome 
" Crown Series " of large-page books, this time 
on M China," with text by Sir Henry Arthur 
Blake. The text of the book, with its modicum 
of geographical and historical matter, and its 
descriptions of Chinese manners and customs, 
some of them already well known to the western 
world, is little more than an excuse for the illus- 
trations ; but these are life-like and worthy of 
careful study. The subjects are well adapted to 
color-printing — to its defects as well as to its 
excellences. The clearness and apparent faith- 
fulness of drawing, in the colored and uncolored 
pictures alike, reveal great care and skill. 
Occasion is taken to insert Lady Blake's ad- 
dress as president of a women's conference at 
Shanghai, in 1900, for the discussion of the 
home life of the women of China. Also extracts 
are given from the Eeport of the Singapore 
Commission appointed to consider the opium 
question. Both the author and the commissioners 
whom he quotes are evidently inclined to regard 
the protest against opium-importation as simply 
one more " unconsidered outburst of European 
sentiment." The book is an art work of merit, 
and (no negligible item to many buyers) of 
modest price. 

" Court Life in China," by Professor Isaac 
Taylor Headland of the Peking University, gives 
itself largely to the praises (not undeserved) of 
the late Empress Dowager. Her obscure origin 
was naturally kept as secret as possible in her 
lifetime, but the author has discovered, he says, 
that she was one of the several children born to 
poor parents, and that in her childhood she car- 
ried the babies on her back, a la chinoise, and 
amused them with the simple toys sold at a cash 
or two apiece. Her lamented selection to grace 
the imperial court, where it was supposed she 
would ever afterward be dead to all the outside 
world, and her subsequent memorable experi- 
ences and achievements, are chronicled at length. 
In a chapter devoted to the reforms instituted 
by her, the author presents the opium question 
under a quite different light from that thrown 
on it in the book we have just noticed, and he 
regrets that the reformer's life was not spared 
until her beneficent plan had been completely 
carried out. The book also eulogizes the late

Emperor; but as the author was in a position 
to obtain full knowledge of what he wrote, there 
is little reason to dispute him. Chinese education 
is naturally a subject that interests him, and one 
in which he succeeds in interesting the reader. 
From Mrs. Headland's notebook he has drawn 
for information on Chinese women, and between 
them both they have made an excellent and an 
instructive book. It is well illustrated. 

Mrs. Archibald Little has lived among the 
Chinese and has written several books about 
them. Her latest study of social conditions and 
peculiar customs in the Celestial Kingdom is 
entitled " In the Land of the Blue Gown." She 
well says that " each nation gets accustomed to 
its own short-comings, and has wide-open eyes 
for its neighbours'," and she views the back- 
wardness and the ignorance of China with a tol- 
erance born of adequate consciousness of western 
defects and abuses. A welcome departure from 
most books on China is found in her long 
chapter devoted to " Life on a Farmstead," 
occupying more than a quarter of the entire 
volume. There is much that is primitive and 
delightful in Chinese rural life. A chapter on 
" Little Known Border Tribes," and one de- 
scribing an anti-footbinding crusade, which 
seems to have met with some success, are also 
among the book's novelties. We are told that 
in 1906 the movement for unbound feet had 
progressed so far, thanks to official favor and 
imperial edict, that some ladies of fashion went 
to the extreme of stuffing their shoes to make 
their feet appear larger than they really were ; 
and that at a crowded meeting in Shanghai a 
committee of Chinese men of influence took over 
the management of the reform from the foreign 
ladies who had hitherto directed it. Though 
foot-binding may still linger among the ignorant 
poor in remote districts, this abuse is thought 
by the author to have received its death-blow. 
Pictures from photographs are generously pro- 
vided. 

Under the simple title, " The Chinese," Mr. 
John Stuart Thomson has written a book of 
readable quality, pleasantly enlivened with inci- 
dents and anecdotes, and provided with numer- 
ous illustrations and a map. The opening 
chapter on " Daily Life of Foreigners in China " 
and the next following on " The Portuguese and 
Camoens in China" are a little apart from the 
author's main subject ; but when he proceeds to 
describe " Incidents of Daily Life among the 
Chinese," and to give examples of " Chinese 
Humor," he hits on some matters that are dis- 



tinctive and worth while. One must, however, 
question his assertion that "half of the false hair 
used in America and Europe is gathered in 
China." Considerations of color and quality 
make this doubtful — although it really matters 
not at all, one way or the other. As an example 
of Chinese humor it is related that one Huan 
" had refused to join the local Triad Society in 
organizing opposition to an unpopular but pow- 
erful magistrate. He thereupon was asked for 
his reasons, and replied that he had ten. ' And 
what are they ? ' ' Two wives and eight chil- 
dren.' " There is a very western, not to say 
American, flavor to that ; but the essence of 
humor is much the same all the world over. Mr. 
Thomson's opinion of the late Empress Dowager 
differs widely from Mr. Headland's. He speaks 
of her " banyan-like shade " and her " obstruc- 
tionist " policy, and ascribes to her character- 
istics that are far from admirable. A chapter 
on " Chinese Art and Literature " — too big a 
subject for even an entire volume — contains 
some striking proverbial and epigrammatic 
native utterances. Speaking of the late ineffec- 
tive Opium Conference at Shanghai, the author 
says : " We shall have other conferences, and 
America will call them until Britain keeps her 
word." 

A third edition of Mr. E. H. Parker's " John 
Chinaman, and a Few Others" has made its 
appearance, nearly eight years after the book's 
first issue. It is of an anecdotal and amusing 
character, and (if one may credit the assertion 
of the writer himself) has met with cordial 
welcome as a banisher of dull care. In his 
preface to this edition the author writes : "I 
am proud to say that several scientific and pro- 
fessional men personally unknown to me have 
written to thank me for having contributed a 
mite to the gaiety of nations in publishing ' John 
Chinaman '; and I have reason to believe that 
at least one of them uses it as Darwin is stated 
to have used Mark Twain's ' Innocents Abroad,' 
— as a means of securing sleep in a jolly frame 
of mind when he feels overwrought." At any 
rate, Mr. Parker has lived in China, has min- 
gled with the natives, and has studied their 
humors. He divides his matter into sixteen 
chapters, and each of these into numerous sub- 
sections, with plenty of dialogue and anecdote, 
so that his pages have that open, inviting look 
that all readers for pleasure know how to value. 
Pictures, too, abound, and a glossary is added 
for the benefit of those who like to have foreign 
terms convey a definite meaning.

A Pageant or Fair Women.* 

" Still with their fires Love tipt his keenest darts ; 
As once they drew into two burning rings 
All beams of Love, melting the mighty hearts 
Of captains and of kings." 

The type of woman to which Tennyson here 
has reference is the type that inspires not only 
the poet but the biographer. The famous woman 
is oftenest interesting because of the world's 
perennial interest in the theme of romantic love. 
The charming ladies whose sprightly memoirs 
are here under discussion possessed many and 
diverse talents, but they were all bountifully 
endowed with one — the talent for V amour. 
They loved, perhaps not wisely, but with enthu- 
siasm. They craved, also, position and power ; 
and not infrequently they won them, shaping the 
affairs of men and the events of history. From 
them to the modern woman militant, striving to 
overcome mere man by physical force, horsewhip- 
ping prime ministers and scuffling with the po- 
lice, is a far cry indeed. We point the contrast, 
without favoring the methods and manners of 
either class. 

In the portly volume with the expressive 
title " Enchanters of Men," Miss Ethel Col- 
burn Mayne has gathered together twenty-three 
typical examples of fascinating femininity 
grouped under five headings — " The Royal 
Mistress," "The Courtesan," "The Royal 
Lady," " The Star," and " The ■ Egeria.' " In 
point of time, these charmers range from Diane 
de Poitiers and Bianca Capello, of the sixteenth 
century, to Jenny Lind and Evelina Hanska of 
the nineteenth. Strange company most of these 
enterprising ladies are for our virtuous Scandi- 
navian songstress. The writer herself seems to 
be conscious of the incongruity ; to her mind 
there is a lack of spice in Jenny Lind's exem- 
plary history, as compared, for example, with

that of Ninon de Lenclos, of Lola Montez, and 
of Adrienne Lecouvreur. The book contains a 
generous amount of reading matter, and por- 
traits of all but one of the " enchanters," with 
Lord Byron and Henry of Navarre thrown in 
as congenial company. 

One of the most seductive, and in some re- 
spects most amiable, of the " enchanters " por- 
trayed in Miss Mayne's work has been chosen by 
Mr. H. Noel Williams as the subject of a much 
more elaborate study in his " Madame du Barry." 
This author of nearly a dozen books on famous 
French women has made himself so well known 
to readers of such memoirs that it will here suf- 
fice to say that the du Barry is treated with all 
his wonted diligence of research and entertain- 
ing style of narration. This last of the left-hand 
queens of France appeals to us by virtue of a cer- 
tain goodness of heart and magnanimity of sen- 
timent. Three times she interceded to save con- 
demned persons from death ; she was a generous 
giver, even when her means were small ; she was 
always moved to indignant protest by the sight 
of cruelty or the neglect of suffering ; and she 
was free from malice, and " had the virtue, rare, 
especially amongst her own sex, of never speak- 
ing ill of anyone." There is no lack of material 
from which to put together an account of this 
successful aspirant to the " glorious dishonor " 
of being a king's mistress, and her latest biog- 
rapher appears to have made good use of his 
predecessors' labors. He closes his preface by 
thanking the Art Reproduction Company for 
assistance in selecting the portraits that appear 
in his volume, although the most diligent search 
fails to discover any but the frontispiece like- 
ness, the same, by the way, that is found in 
Miss Mayne's book — the simpering miniature 
executed by Richard Cosway. 

The portraits that may have been intended for 
the preceding volume appear in large numbers 
in another book by the same author, entitled 
" The Rose of Savoy." On the 7th December 
1697, Marie Adelaide of Savoy, being then 
twelve years and a day old, was united in mar- 
riage to Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy, 
grandson of Louis the Fourteenth ; and by him 
she became, in 1710, the mother of " the 
prettiest child in the world " (as she described 
him in a letter) , the future Louis the Fifteenth 
of France. In his ample volume the prolific 
Mr. H. Noel Williams has told the story of this 
royal marriage, with its preliminaries and se- 
quels, and has embellished the whole by the 
insertion of many portraits of contemporary 
celebrities. As there have come down to us

[Dec. 1, 



accounts of various flirtations and coquetries 
indulged in by this Rose of Savoy — even in- 
cluding an affair with the Abbe de Polignac — 
it is safe to conclude that her serious-minded 
spouse endured some unpleasant quarters of an 
hour before the two were cut off by an untimely 
death in 1712. " It would be difficult," says 
the author, " to find two persons more dissimilar 
in character than the young people who thus be- 
gan their married life when their united ages 
scarcely exceeded thirty years." The young 
wife, who was an excellent mimic, went so far 
as to bring ridicule on her unhappy husband by 
her mimetic performances, which contributed to 
the gayety of the court, but not to the serenity 
of him who had espoused the Rose of Savoy. 

Treating of the same period and the same 
court as the last-named book, the posthumous 
and not quite completed work of the late Mme. 
Charles Vincens ("Arv&de Barine"), "Madame, 
Mother of the Regent," gives a cleverly- written 
account of a German princess married against 
her will to a French prince suspected of poison- 
ing his first wife and more than suspected of not 
leading a highly virtuous life. She survived 
her husband by twenty-one years, and lived to 
see herself a decidedly important personage as 
mother of the Duke of Orleans, Regent upon 
the death of the Grand Monarch and before 
Louis the Fifteenth had attained to manhood. 
Although the writer has been complimented for 
her rare gift of making her various historic 
characters live and breathe before the reader's 
eyes, it is to us of the twentieth century a some- 
what artificial, not easily imaginable, set of roy- 
alties and courtiers and king's mistresses and 
sycophantic hangers-on that make their exits 
and their entrances in this thoroughly French 
drama of the late seventeenth and early eight- 
eenth century. The translation, from the pen 
of Madame Charles Bigot, is commendably 
fluent and readable ; and she has, one infers, 
supplied the brief closing chapter left unwritten 
by the author. Twenty-four illustrations, mostly 
portraits, are scattered through the book. 

By a coincidence not unusual in the book- 
world, another elaborate treatment of the same 
theme as that of the preceding volume appears 
at the same time. This is Mr. Ernest F. 
Henderson's lavishly illustrated and engagingly 
written volume, " A Lady of the Old Regime." 
In his pages the corpulent Elisabeth Charlotte 
(Liselotte they called her at home, in Heidel- 
berg) appears as a very human, far from fault- 
less, but extremely companionable sort of person; 
and she is made to paint her own good-natured 



looking portrait from frequent passages out of 
her familiar correspondence. " There are many 
places in the Bible," she once wrote, " that say 
one must mortify the body ; the Old and the 
New Testaments are full of it. But I think it 
is enough to bear patiently the evil that comes 
to us from the hand of God without torturing 
ourselves. I never could endure La Trappe." 
A contemporary diarist, quoted by Mr. Hender- 
son, records the satirical epitaph composed on 
Madame : " Here lies idleness, the mother of 
all vice." But if she lacked energy and indus- 
try, partly for physical reasons (she complained 
in later life that it made her puff like a buffalo 
to walk across the floor), she succeeded, in her 
passive Germanly phlegmatic way, in being a 
good deal of a personage. Evidently her 
strength was to sit still. 

From the practised pen of Mr. Francis 
Gribble there comes a readable and far from 
superfluous volume entitled " Chateaubriand 
and his Court of Women." An adequate life of 
this interesting man has hitherto been lacking 
in English, if not also in French itself. Doubt- 
less the Memoires d 1 Outre-tombe have gener- 
ally been felt to cover the ground sufficiently 
well ; but the recent discovery of many letters 
and other documents bearing on Chateaubri- 
and's life has, as Mr. Gribble is justified in 
thinking, made it possible and desirable to pro- 
duce a biography. The title he has chosen is 
explained in the author's preface, where he says : 
" It seems to follow that the time has come 
when a synoptic view of that career may at last 
be taken with some hope that the resulting 
picture will at once approximate to exactitude, 
and bring into due relief those romantic epi- 
sodes in it to which Chateaubriand himself 
appears to have attached the most importance. 
What those episodes were may be inferred from 
the fact that, alike as a pilgrim to the Holy 
Land and as Secretary of State for Foreign 
Affairs, he wrote that his sole ambition was to 
' win glory ' in order that he might ' lay it at a 
woman's feet.'" His "court of women" in- 
cludes Madame Recamier, Pauline de Beau- 
mont, the Duchesse de Berry, and many others. 
The chapter devoted to his American travels is 
of especial interest to American readers. Por- 
traits of Chateaubriand and five of his " court " 
are included in the volume. 

In Mr. Edgcumbe Staley's " Famous Women 
of Florence " there reappears one of the " en- 
chanters of men " included in the first book in 
the present group, Bianca Capello — or Bianca 
de' Capelli, as Mr. Staley writes the name,

though he prefers to call her Bianca de' Medici 
in his chapter narrating her history and her 
connection with Francesco de' Medici. The 
other characters selected as types of Florentine 
womanhood are Beatrice de' Portinari, " the 
type of the New AVoman in the dawn of the 
Renaissance "; Lucrezia de' Tornabuoni, " the 
most exalted exponent of the over-riding power 
of woman for good "; Simonetta de' Cattanei, 
" the perfect model of woman's physical 
charms "; Giovanna degli Albizzi, " the exam- 
ple of a duteous daughter, the sympathetic wife 
of a man of fashion, and, with him, the highest 
standard of the civilization and refinement of 
the Renaissance "; Alessandra de' Machingi, 
the pathetic example of a shadowed life and a 
noble patience ; and Lisa de' Gherardini, a per- 
son of happy nature and smiling face. These 
women, selected out of many that have appealed 
to the author in the course of his Florentine 
studies, have each a separate chapter, and are 
in most cases represented by a portrait. Index 
and bibliography give evidence of care in the 
book's making, although a list of fifty-five errata 
is also proof of carelessness in some quarter.

Everyone who loves a beautiful book will delight 
in the volume on " French Cathedrals," by Mrs. 
Elizabeth Robins Pennell. illustrated by Mr. Joseph 
Pennell, which appears in uniform binding with 
their " English Cathedrals " (Century Co.). Natur- 
ally, the illustrations receive first praise. One 
hundred and eighty-three of them, the title-page 
says there are ; but more important than their 
number is the fact that the French Government has 
acquired the original drawings for the Luxembourg. 
Pen-drawings, wash-drawings, and etchings are re- 
produced in black and white, or black and tint. 
Various in scope, from details of screen or doorway 
to vistas of nave or transept and distant views of 
u tower and town," they present a series of views 
of each cathedral which gives a full impression from 
without and from within. One learns from them 
not only the features with which each great structure 
faces the world, as it were consciously, in the tra- 
ditional view, but their unconscious and intrinsic 
character, surprised from unexpected points and 
revealed in the moods of different atmospheres. It 
is for further revelation of this essential character 
that the text is most admirable. Mrs. Pennell never 
wrote more charmingly, with reminiscence personal 
enough, never intrusively so. But more than fluent 
style and ample knowledge — which, though she 



disclaims the technician's skill, is adequate to the 
reader's need — is the fact that she feels her 
churches. " There are churches," she says, " as 
there are men, who seem to impose on one the 
necessity, or at least the desire, to record the effect 
made by their personality, or individuality, in the 
course of long and close intimacy." These impres- 
sions are "deep and vivid " with her, and she records 
them sincerely and therefore convincingly. She 
sees in the French cathedral a democratic institu- 
tion, not shut off, like the English in its close, but 
"the centre of the town and town life." "The 
people are as out of place in an English cathedral 
as in Buckingham palace ; in a French cathedral or 
church they are as much at home as in their own 
cottage or garret." Her characterization of each 
famous edifice is penetrating, a challenge for agree- 
ment or disagreement. Amiens "has a serenity 
which is more in keeping with the spirit of Greek 
than of a Gothic beauty." Notre- Dame-de-Paris, for 
all its Gothic perfection, is "a church without a 
soul." Rheims " the magnificent " is " made for 
princes and princely rites," but she " cannot imagine 
anyone praying well at Rheims." She recurs most 
often to Chartres, the " House of Prayer," where 
" long lines of prophets and saints, in garments of 
flame, seem to set the cathedral all aglow with the 
fiery fervor of their love and praise." A necessary 
sequel of her love for the churches is her hatred of 
the " restorer." " A church," she says, " like a man 
or woman, ought to look the part it has played." 
Consequently the restorer, who removes the wrinkles 
of experience, is a falsifier. One cannot say a better 
word for text and illustrations than that they are 
worthy of each other, — competent, sincere, beauti- 
ful. The binding, in French blue cloth, half gilt, 
with the tracer}' of a rose window on the cover, is 
appropriate, if somewhat severely plain. 

To travel with Mr. Howells would indeed be the 
perfection of journeying, and it is hard to suppress 
a pang of envy for any friend whom he happens to 
refer to as his companion. But, fortunately, Mr. 
Howells has that grace with his pen which includes 
himself among the realities he presents, and makes 
the illusion of listening to him, instead of reading, 
quite easy. In "Seven English Cities" (Harper), 
he is as gossippy and entertaining as ever. Liverpool, 
Manchester, and Sheffield receive his first attention ; 
and he insists that in spite of the cavalier treatment 
these places usually receive from travellers, they are 
" worthy to be seen and known." A doubt with re- 
gard to Liverpool may still linger in the mind of the 
reader, for Mr. Howells scarcely justifies anything in 
it except St. George's Hall ; but that may be only 
because, as he says, most of his memories of the place 
have been acquired since his visit. Or it may be 
because he is too much occupied in holding up the 
mirror to the " fond behavior of arriving Ameri- 
cans." But Manchester, with its parks, old-fashioned 
mansions, and dignified public buildings, and 
Sheffield, with its " dead forest " of chimneys, its 
Dukeries, and its Manor pathetic with memories of

Mary Queen of Scots, evidently deserve his plea. 
York, however, holds him longest. Here he is 
haunted less hy the " clutter of incidents " of Eng- 
lish history than hy Roman associations, and " never 
can get enough " of the windows of the Minster. 
Marston Moor eluded him, hut he was compensated 
by " the civility from everyone which had so ineffec- 
tively abetted his search." After a glimpse of Dur- 
ham, " where the mediaeval atmosphere is in perfect 
repair," he reaches Boston, a city in some respects 
unworthy of its New England descendant, especially 
in its ignorance of the places hallowed by the 
Pilgrims. Aberystwyth and Llandudno, Welsh 
watering-places with beautiful curving beaches and 
a perpetual supply of negro minstrels, complete the 
sacred number of his visitations. The Welsh he 
finds, not, according to their reputation, the " prize 
liars of the universe," but truthful — although volu- 
able, — amiable, and admirably co-educated. The 
closing chapter on English character will cause some 
discussion. Are the English, as Mr. Howells thinks, 
really more courteous than Americans, and also more 
loyal, more united, and more charitable? The 
volume is furnished with an abundance of half-tones, 
which not only really illustrate it, but are accomodat- 
ingly placed just where they are wanted. 

Mr. George Wharton Edwards has found in 
" Holland of To-day " a most congenial and remu- 
nerative field for his artistic endeavor. He knows 
the country and its people thoroughly, and is evi- 
dently an enthusiast on the subject of things Dutch. 
He has made for his book — for he is its author as 
well as illustrator — a series of beautiful studies of 
Dutch types in color, other less elaborate but no less 
artistic black-and-white sketches of figures, and 
many interesting drawings of Dutch cities, villages, 
canals, and farm-houses. The plates are not mere 
illustrations, — they are pictures, each a thing of 
beauty, and altogether setting forth a view of 
Holland which is striking, individual, inviting, and 
impressive. Considered as a picture book, this 
deserves to be one of the most successful of the 
season's output. It is unfortunate that Mr. Edwards 
chose to write the text to accompany his pictures ; 
and more unfortunate, since he has so chosen, that 
his work should not have been skilfully edited. The 
impression left by the pictures is vivid, clear-cut, 
salient ; the text is a confused and confusing mass 
of detail, the interesting parts jostling the common- 
place, the arrangement illogical, a point of view 
fatally lacking, the effect incoherent. " Art, Ancient 
and Modern," for example, is the heading of one 
chapter, — a comprehensive enough topic, one would 
think, to fill the eighteen pages allotted to it. But 
the fishing industry, horse-racing, yacht clubs, 
cycling, skating, and marriage customs in Holland, 
are among the other subjects treated in that chapter. 
The book is full of information, undoubtedly reliable ; 
but it overwhelms the hapless reader, who will turn 
with relief to the pictures, cheerfully forgiving Mr. 
Edwards his literary shortcomings for their sake.

Mr. Robert Haven Schauffler's magazine sketches 
of various German cities have been gathered into a 
volume entitled " Romantic Germany " (Century 
Co.), for which half-a-dozen German artists furnish 
illustrations in color and black-and-white. " In the 
surfeit of books on Germany," says Mr. Schauffler 
in his preface, " one subject has been strangely 
neglected, and that is — the land itself." And so 
he writes of the picturesque old towns, with their 
Gothic houses, mediaeval courtyards, and turreted 
ring- walls, — towns that make one think of Germany 
as the land of the Nibelungenlied and Grimm's 
Fairy Tales, of gnomes and giants, of romance and 
poetry and magic. Dantzig, Rothenburg, Hilde- 
sheim, Meissen — all have distinct personalities for 
Mr. Schauffler, and he delineates their characters 
and interrelations most delightfully, as only a tried 
and discerning friend could do. Most of the older 
German cities, he explains, " are coy, and cover 
their charms with a cheap new veil." But for Mr. 
Schauffler the veil hides no secret charms ; he 
understands them all, and makes them concrete for 
his readers, until they feel with him as if they were 
" walking bodily through the pages of Grimm." The 
pictures are in many styles, but all have been chosen 
with reference to the romantic note. Tested by 
novelty of view-point and charm of style, Mr. 
Schauffler's book has few rivals among recent vol- 
umes of travel-sketches. 

A new and enlarged edition of Mr. John Muir's 
" Our National Parks " (Houghton) gives opportu- 
nity to express further appreciation of that remark- 
able work. Mr. Muir has suffered much at the 
hands of the " forty mile a day " tourist, but he still 
thinks that " the tendency nowadays to wander in 
wildernesses is delightful to see." Certainly his 
descriptions of the wild parks of the West, from the 
flower-covered tundras of Alaska to the sculptured 
walls of the Grand Canon, will incite a genuine 
desire to wander in them. The Yellowstone Park 
he would have us know as he does — mountains, 
geysers, geology, and all — even to the climbing of 
Electric Peak in a thunder-storm, when " every hair 
of your head will stand up and hum and sing like 
an enthusiastic congregation." Of the Yosemite he 
writes still better, for it is his home and his pride. 
In this " Paradise that makes even the loss of Eden 
seem insignificant," he knows every rock, the name 
and habit of every stream and bird and flower. 
From his own experience he can say of the trees : 
" To learn how they live and behave in pure wild- 
ness . . . you must love them and live with them, 
as free from schemes and cares and time as the 
trees themselves.'' Both laughable and pathetic is 
the story of his disappointment when he failed to 
persuade Emerson to spend a night with him under 
the stars. " The mountains are calling," he said ; 
"run away!" But the "indoor philosophy" of 
Emerson's friends objected. " Mr. Emerson might 
take cold," and they consigned him to the hotel. 
u And to think," reflects Mr. Muir, " of this being 
a Boston choice ! Sad commentary on culture and

the glorious transcendentalism !" Mr. Muir is the 
prophet of the American forests, and it is for us to 
see that he is our Isaiah with regard to them, 
and not our Jeremiah. His closing chapter, on the 
American forest, ought to be known by every citi- 
zen. The wantonness of destruction, the inadequacy 
of our laws, and the whole u bad, black business," 
is set forth with clearness and force, but without 
vituperation. This is as near as he comes to unduly 
strong language : " God has cared for these trees, 
saved them from drought, disease, avalanches, and 
a thousand straining, levelling tempests and floods ; 
but he cannot save them from fools, — only Uncle 
Sam can do that." In the new edition, maps and 
tables increase the book's usefulness, and there are 
many half-tone illustrations showing forests, moun- 
tains, the Alpine flora of the Sierras, their beautiful 
trout streams, and a few of the native denizens of 
the Western wilds. 

Miss Helen A. Clarke, author of " Browning's 
Italy " and " Browning's England," has proved her 
interest in the environment of the poets of her own 
land by a study of " Longfellow's Country " (Baker 
& Taylor Co.). From the quaintly-colored print of 
colonial houses and a scarlet-coated goodman on the 
cover, to the last of the well-printed octavo pages, 
the book is satisfying both to the eye and the mind. 
The fact that the subjects of many of the numerous 
half-tones are familiar adds to their interest. The 
subject-matter insures both popularity and apprecia- 
tion by students ; for not only does Miss Clarke do 
justice to the geographical phase of her subject, 
describing with especial vividness the beauties of 
the Acadian country and of old Cambridge, but she 
presents accurately the sources of most of the poems. 
Though " no Skald in song has told " the story of 
••The Skeleton in Armor," the "Saga of Eric the 
Red " is reviewed for possible suggestions and pos- 
sible references to the New England coast, and to 
the reader's gratification the legends from which 
Hiawatha grew are repeated in full. If Miss Clarke 
makes it evident that Longfellow was not " slavishly 
accurate as to the succession of events " — or even 
as to the events themselves — she gives us all the 
more reason to credit him with originality. It may 
be disappointing to know that the Acadians did not 
live as ideal a life as Longfellow depicts, that the 
schooner wrecked on Norman's Woe was not the 
Hesperus, and that Paul Revere did not "stamp 
the earth" of the Charleston shore waiting for his 
signal. But on the whole the author adds more to 
the romance of the poems than she takes away, and 
the familiarity which results from her study breeds 
new love and admiration. 

The role of author-illustrator is a difficult one, 
too often played badly ; but Mr. Ernest Peixotto is 
competent for it, as he proves anew by his skilful 
conduct of his readers M Through the French Pro- 
vinces " (Scribner). Sometimes he takes them by 
motor-boat, sometimes by motor-car, but always in 
the pleasant company of a traveller alert to discover 
picturesqueness hidden in out-of-the-way corners, 



and able to impart his enthusiasms with the pen as 
well as with the tools of his own craft. His literary 
work is not at all remarkable, — only the graceful 
and agreeable relation of personal experiences and 
impressions, many of which are visualized, naturally 
with much more force and finish, in the illustrations. 
As an artist, Mr. Peixotto's first interest in rural 
France seems to be architecture ; for nearly every 
picture represents a building or a group of buildings. 
Motor-boat excursions down the Seine from Poissy 
to Rouen and up the poplar-fringed Oise, trips to 
gay Parisian suburbs like " Robinson " or to little- 
known chateaux near Fontainebleau, motor journeys 
through the provinces, with stops at towns like 
Limoges, Carcassonne, Cordes, and Chinon, com- 
prise Mr. Peixotto's inviting itinerary. The material- 
minded tourist will be glad to know that Mr. 
Peixotto is an epicure as well as an artist ; he does 
not forget to tell which inns are comfortable, as well 
as which are picturesque. Indeed, his strong insist- 
ence on creature-comforts is a little amusing, though 
we refer to it here merely to call attention to the 
diversity of interests covered by his book. 

The county of Worcestershire is the subject of one 
of those beautiful color-books that English artists 
and publishers are uniting nowadays to produce in 
great profusion. In this instance, Mr. Thomas 
Tyndale is the illustrator, Mr. A. G. Bradley his 
literary coadjutor, and Messrs. Maemillan Co. are the 
publishers. There are twenty-five alluring glimpses 
of English villages and country-sides, which go far 
to support Mr. Bradley's theory that Worcestershire 
deserves more than it gets of the tourist's attention ; 
and there is a map to freshen one's geographical 
memory and at the same time to suggest feasible trips 
through the county. The text is a conventional 
resume", historical and descriptive in about equal 
measure. As the storm-centre of the Civil Wars, 
Worcestershire has a romantic past affording ample 
material for the historical survey. Topographically, 
the river Severn and the Malvern hills lend it a cer- 
tain distinction. Mr. Bradley does not deal much 
in superlatives, which is no doubt one important 
reason why his descriptions are pleasing. Again, he 
wisely assumes no responsibility for exhaustiveness, 
particularly where architectural or industrial details 
are concerned, but follows a leisurely course of his 
own, along the Severn and the Avon, and traverses 
more hastily the less picturesque north-east section, 
loitering in the little villages along the way to point 
out what he finds significant or characteristic in each 
of them. And in the same spirit of individualism 
Mr. Tyndale's pictures are painted. 

A picturesque glimpse of a rarely visited portion 
of Northern Africa, namely, the state of Tripoli, is 
afforded by Mr. Charles Wellington Furlong's 
"The Gateway to the Sahara" (Scribner). Mr. 
Furlong is fortunate in having a very definite object 
in view, and more fortunate in having achieved it. 
Here is no ill-assorted guide-book miscellanea, no 
mass of unrelated detail passed on from an author 
bewildered by his conglomeration of notes, to a

reader certain to be even more bewildered. Instead, 
there is real insight into the unique fascination of 
the most unspoiled of the Barbary capitals, pictures, 
full of color and atmosphere, of its life and of the 
strange peoples who inhabit the oases and plateaus 
of Tripoli* The story of the Greek sponge-divers 
and of the esparto-pickers is told with vivid detail ; 
and the same power to vitalize a narrative charac- 
terizes the account of a journey across the Sahara. 
Mr. Furlong has pointed, drawn, and photographed 
Tripoli, besides writing about it ; and he has done 
all four things well. One of the important figures, 
both in pictures and text, is naturally the camel — 
" dignified, patient, defiant, imperturbable." Mr. 
Furlong understands the camel as he understands 
many other things oriental, and the chapter on 
" Camel Traits " is one of his cleverest. In this, as 
throughout the book, the transcription of Arab 
stories and proverbs adds greatly to the effect of 
local color. 

The cathedral is always the heart of its city — 
the magnet that draws and holds the tourist. Its 
charm is too complex to be quickly exhausted. Each 
new angle of vision reveals fresh wonders, wrought 
by many minds and hands, in many periods. Some- 
what thus does Miss Esther Singleton justify her 
choice of subject for the latest addition to a well- 
known series of compilations edited by her, — "Fa- 
mous Cathedrals as Seen and Described by Great 
Writers " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) . It was of course 
impossible to include in one volume all the notable 
cathedrals; so Miss Singleton has added to those 
universally agreed upon as the most celebrated, 
others that will offer to the reader the greatest pos- 
sible variety of instruction and pleasure. A still 
more varied programme is secured by mingling 
architectural, descriptive, and historical selections, 
and including a few impressionistic pictures, like 
Mr. Arthur Synions's of Bourges, and Gautier's 
of St. Isaac. Each selection is accompanied by an 
excellent photograph of the cathedral in question. 
Altogether Miss Singleton has achieved an excellent 
handbook, interesting in itself and well adapted to 
introduce its readers to more detailed and less 
alluring studies of cathedral lore. 

Book lovers who have an eye for richly-colored 
pictures, and are the better pleased if the scenes are 
grand and wonderful, will find their taste abund- 
antly satisfied by the volume on Kashmir written by 
Sir Francis Younghusband, British Resident at 
Srinagar, and illustrated with seventy-five full-color 
reproductions of paintings by Major Molyneux. 
These views of the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, 
with wooded valleys or blue mountain streams or 
masses of gorgeous flowers in the foreground, are so 
lavishly and strikingly beautiful that they would be 
condemned as melodramatic if the text did not bear 
them out. Sir Francis's writing is much more 
than a gloss for the pictures, and fully describes the 
entire region, including its history, government, 
industries, and resources — especially its resources 
in the matter of recreation and sport. One cannot 



close the book without exclaiming with Bernier, " In 
truth, the kingdom surpasses in beauty all that my 
warmest imagination had anticipated." The volume 
is a thick octavo, bound in dark red, half gilt, with 
a border suggestive of the designs of elaborate 
Indian textiles. (The Macmillan Co. ) 

Holiday Editions of Standard Books. 
Surely no richer tribute could be paid by the 
artist brotherhood to a poet's memory than this cen- 
tennial year has brought to Edward FitzGerald. At 
least five beautiful editions of the Rubstiy^t have 
been published within three months ; two of them 
ranking among the few most notable illustrated 
books of the year. A gold-and-white cover with 
fantastic and beautiful symbolic decorations is in 
harmony with the almost fairy-like beauty of the 
edition of Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton, for which 
Mr. Edmund Dulac has made the illustrations. The 
same artist's pictures for the " Arabian Nights " 
suggest what he will do here ; but in the newer 
illustrations the element of grotesqueness is mini- 
mized, and the atmosphere of wonder and enchant- 
ment, of beauty, mystical, oriental, multi-colored, is 
enhanced. There are twenty pictures, some inter- 
preting a stanza, some a line or a phrase. These 
are separately mounted on vellum-finished paper 
within rich gold borders that have the effect of 
frames. The text of the poem is printed in large 
clear type on pages with more formal decoration. 
In every respect the volume is mechanically worthy 
of the art which the illustrator has expended to 
make it a thing of beauty. — The " FitzGerald 
Centenary Edition" (T. Y. Crowell & Co.) is 
illustrated and decorated by another master of the 
craft, Mr. Willy Pogany. His designs, richly im- 
aginative, very original, and full of oriental imagery 
and atmosphere, form an interesting contrast with 
those of Mr. Dulac. Mr. Pogany has lettered each 
stanza of the poem in a style suggesting Arabic 
characters, and made for each a special border in 
several colors. — The familiar designs of Mr. Gil- 
bert James, with their quaint formality and curious 
detail, are the distinguishing feature of a third edi- 
tion of FitzGerald's masterpiece, published by the 
Messrs. Macmillan. The pictures are reproduced 
in full color, and there are borders and other deco- 
rations in tint. An introduction and notes by Pro- 
fessor Reynold Alley ne Nicholson, lecturer in Persian 
at Cambridge University, gives to this edition 
scholarly as well as artistic distinction. — A less 
pretentious edition comes from the Messrs. J. B. 
Lippincott Co., with introduction, notes, and a life 
of Omar, by Mr. Joseph Jacobs, and illustrations 
and borders by Mr. Frank Brangwyn. The deco- 
rative work is very interesting, but the strong real- 
ism of the illustrations makes them rather repulsive 
to at least one reader. — Finally, we have another 
small edition, with Mr. Gilbert James's illustrations 
reproduced in tint, from Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. 
Like all this publisher's editions, it is attractively 
printed ; it is on hand-made paper, and the board

covers are Japanese in effect, if Japan was not 
actually the source of the material used. 

Of all Aubrey Beardsley's decorative work, his 
drawings for the " Morte D'Arthur " are generally 
conceded to be the finest. The original edition 
containing them was issued some sixteen years ago, 
in two volumes, and has, of course, long been out of 
print. All the original designs and illustrations are 
now reproduced in a one-volume edition (Dutton), 
limited to fifteen hundred copies printed from type. 
At present the popular taste runs to colored illus- 
tration, which modern processes of color-printing 
have made possible in such perfection ; but black- 
and-white has a charm of its own, and Beardsley's 
reputation as one of the greatest artists in that me- 
dium is unquestioned. It is unnecessary to speak 
of his style, but readers unfamiliar with the first 
edition of the u Morte D'Arthur " will like to know 
that the present work contains twenty full-page 
illustrations, besides numberless chapter headings, 
page borders, head and tail pieces, and incidental 
decorations. As in the original edition, the text is 
that of Caxton, with modern spelling, and there is 
an introduction by Professor Rhys. The cover is 
embellished with a floral design by Beardsley, 
printed in gold on green cloth. 

Two illustrated editions of Poe's " Tales " com- 
memorate the centennial year of the author's birth. 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons issue them in a vol- 
ume uniform with their illustrated edition of Poe's 
poems published last fall, and with two dozen half- 
tones from drawings by the same artist, Mr. Fred- 
erick Simpson Coburn. Mr. Coburn has already 
shown his ability to interpret Poe pictorially, and 
here as elsewhere the spirit of his drawings is in 
tune with the " grotesque and arabesque " humor of 
the text. — ''Selected Tales of Mystery" (Lippin- 
cott) is the title chosen for the other edition, which 
is a stout royal oct?vo volume, sumptuously printed 
in large type, and strikingly illustrated in color by 
Mr. Byam Shaw. The cover design at once strikes 
the dominant notes of Mr. Shaw's work ; it is intense 
in coloring, intense in realism, subtle in suggestion. 
No half-hearted appreciation of Poe's genius is pos- 
sible to the reader of this edition. He will shiver 
and thrill perforce to the horror of Poe's grewsome 
inventions. He may dislike Mr. Shaw's pictures ; he 
may decide that they disregard too much the mys- 
ticism of Poe. and make the horror of the tales too 
earthy. But he cannot fail to get a vivid and vital 
impression of some sort, that will, in one way or 
another, vivify and vitalize his impression of Poe. 
And that is one important mission of the illustrator's 
art. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson, author-illustrator, has be- 
taken himself and his camera to the Maine woods, 
and, following the trail broken by Thoreau on his 
three trips to the northern wilderness, has brought 
back some beautiful photographs of rushing streams, 
lonely log-camps, forest-bordered lakes, and wood- 
land glens, with a few of campers and canoemen for 
variety. These, reproduced in half-tone, with a 



photogravure for frontispiece, comprise the illustra- 
tive material in a new holiday edition of Thoreau's 
"The Maine Woods" (Crowell). Nextto"Walden," 
this is probably Thoreau's most popular work. Mr. 
Johnson's landscapes make a delightful accompan- 
iment to the descriptions ; but it seems a trifle pre- 
sumptuous to people Thoreau's wilds with figures 
obviously of to-day, quite unrelated to Thoreau and 
his narrative. A less heavily begilded cover would 
also, in our opinion, harmonize better with Thoreau's 
style and the taste of his admirers. Print and paper 
are excellent. 

A dainty holiday edition of Lowell's famous 
country idyl, ■ The Courtin'," comes from the press 
of Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. A note of intro- 
duction explains how the poem came into being 
quite by accident, and was finished to meet the 
demands of its admirers for an end that did not 
exist. The full text of the poem is printed on 
pages decoratively bordered ; and then follow pic- 
tures in color by Mr. Arthur I. Keller, illustrating 
it line by line. Finally, there is the facsimile of an 
original manuscript of the poem made by the author 
for a book of autographs. End-papers gay with 
Cupids and a novel cover complete a thoroughly 
artistic gift-book. Mr. Keller's work is, as usual, 
full of life and humor, and exquisite in finish and 
coloring. His incidental decorations are particularly 
clever in conception. 

Quaint pictures, redolent with Christmas fun and 
frolic, gay in spirit and in coloring, old-time in flavor 
and very English, are the feature of a new edition 
of Washington Irving's " Old Christmas " (Dodd), 
that classic account of an old-fashioned English 
Yule-tide. The stage-coach and its passengers, the 
village choir, the Christmas balk and the Christmas 
dinner — all are depicted by Mr. Cecil Aldin with 
wonderful spirit and much humor. On the front 
cover the stage-coach, its Christmas travellers laden 
with Christmas bundles, puts one immediately in the 
holiday mood — the right mood, surely, for enjoying 
what is to come. Even the small decorations are 
managed in a thoroughly original way. Altogether 
this is the most Christmas-like edition of " Old 
Christmas " that we remember to have seen. 

Illustrated Books of Fiction. 
Prominent among the season's illustrated novel- 
ettes is Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin's " Susanna and 
Sue " (Houghton). There are pictures in color by 
Mrs. Alice Barber Stephens, and delicately wrought 
chapter-headings by Mr. N. C. Wyeth, besides an 
especially designed cover and the inevitable page- 
borders. But the main thing is the story, which, if 
it is not one of Mrs. Wiggin's happiest efforts, is 
still thoroughly delightful, with its quaint and un- 
usual setting, — a Shaker village in Maine, — its 
charming child heroine, and its simple, straightfor- 
ward answer to one of the great questions of life. 
Susanna married in haste, and, having long repented 
at leisure, she suddenly decided to revolt. She chose 
as refuge a Shaker settlement, where she and her

little girl lived for several months, entering into the 
wholesome, if drab-colored, life of the community 
which brought queer questions to the child's lips, put 
new thoughts into the mother's heart, and finally 
sent her back, at Thanksgiving time, to the husband 
and son she had abandoned. The simple Shakers 
are drawn with thorough understanding, and little 
Sue is, like all Mrs. Wiggin's children, a very real 
and a very lovable child. 

Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour has chosen "The 
Lilac Girl " as the title of his annual novelette for 
1910, and the publishers (Lippincott) have bound 
it in lilac, with lilacs on the end-papers and title- 
page, besides appropriate marginal drawings and 
pictures in color. The tale, like all Mr. Barbour's, 
is unalloyed romance. The hero, being engaged in 
prospecting for gold, gets a fleeting glimpse of the 
heroine on the rear platform of an overland express, 
is mistaken by her for a train-robber, tells her that 
he loves her, inquires her name, promises to come 
for her, and receives as a pledge of her faith " a 
faded spray of purple lilac," all within a space of 
five minutes. And after many strange complica- 
tions and stranger coincidences, he keeps his word, 
and wins the somewhat capricious heart of the Lilac 
Girl. The tale is at once sufficiently brief, improb- 
able, and cleverly told, to make an hour or so pass 
pleasantly, and the setting is pretty enough to ensure 
the book's being a popular gift " from Him to Her." 

" Where the Laborers are Few " (Harper) is the 
title of a delightful new " Old Chester Tale," which, 
with flowers on the cover, trees, brooks, and corn- 
fields in the page-margins, and three illustrations 
by Mrs. Alice Barber Stephens, makes a decidedly 
inviting gift-book. Dr. Lavender, Willy King, and 
the Jay " girls " reappear in the new story, whose 
chief character is a one-legged ex-trapeze-performer, 
stranded in Old Chester by an accident to his one 
remaining " limb," as the Jay girls chastely put it. 
When he appeared poor little Miss Jane Jay sud- 
denly discovered that there was more in life than 
genteel poverty, afghans to knit, and pet cats to love 
and to mourn. What she did when the ex-trapeze- 
performer limped gayly away from Old Chester is 
left to the reader's imagination. 

Pictures in color by Mr. Stanley M. Arthurs, and 
a preface " setting forth how and why the two tales 
are one," comprise the distinctive features of a holi- 
day reprint of " Posson Jone' " and " Pere Raphael," 
both prime favorites among Mr. George W. Cable's 
many delightful Creole stories. Mr. Cable explains 
how he found " Posson Jone " practically ready- 
made one day in Royal Street, New Orleans, and 
how, after being " kept many years in the closest 
companionship of Jules and the Parson by the flat- 
tering willingness of public audiences to hear their 
episode recounted," he finally " accused his blithe 
hero of having another story, as you might say, con- 
cealed on his person," — and the sequel ensued. Mr. 
Arthurs's pictures are spirited, and the cover has the 
decorative touch that is expected of the artistic 
gift-book. (Scribner.) 



Appropriately adorned with blue blossoms on 
cover and page-borders, Mrs. Frances Hodgson Bur- 
nett's " The Land of the Blue Flower " (Moffat, 
Yard & Co.) has the right appearance, as well as 
the right message, for Christmas. For the blue 
flower is the symbol of peace and good-will ; in the 
land where it flourished there was no time to be 
angry or worried or idle or jealous ; no place for 
gloom or misery. The allegory is simply and prettily 
told, and its symbolism runs quite in the trend of 
much modern thought. Mr. Sigismond de Ivan- 
owski furnishes a very beautiful frontispiece. 

" The Star of Love " (Appleton), by Mrs. Florence 
Morse Kingsley, is a novel based upon the Biblical 
story of Esther. Mr. Arthur E. Becher has made 
eight paintings to accompany it, which are repro- 
duced in full color, and chapter headings in black- 
and-white. In outline, the story follows closely the 
Biblical narrative, which is amplified into an absorb- 
ing romance by the introduction of much picturesque 
detail and effective dialogue. The author is a close 
student of sacred history, and her first novel, as well 
as several succeeding ones, had a Biblical theme ; 
though she is probably best known for that clever 
little commentary on the mysterious movings of 
Providence, " The Transfiguration of Miss Philura." 

Under the striking caption, "The Ruinous Face " 
(Harper), Mr. Maurice Hewlett retells the familiar 
tale of Helen of Troy as the tragedy of a beautiful 
woman hungering for spiritual love, which, because 
of her overwhelming beauty, never came to her. Mr. 
Hewlett brings to this short story all the subtlety, 
suggestiveness, and finish that make his novels nota- 
ble. Page borders, and reproductions of three fam- 
ous paintings of the too-fair Helen, are the decorative 
features. 

Admirers of the rather obvious humor of " Josiah 
Allen's Wife " (Miss Marietta Holly) — and they 
are legion — L will rejoice to hear that, having fol- 
lowed the fortunes of Samantha at Saratoga, St. 
Louis, and around the world, they may now hear 
•' Samantha on Children's Rights." Samantha's 
wit and wisdom on the rearing of the young are 
displayed in the course of a story full of children 
and fathers and mothers, whose varied relations are 
laughable one minute and tragic the next. As 
usual, Samantha recounts her experiences in spelling 
bewilderingly phonetic. (Dillingham.) 

Holiday Art Books. 
One more token of a genius come too late into his 
own is furnished by a beautifully illustrated quarto 
volume entitled "Simeon Solomon, an Appreciation," 
by Mrs. Julia Ellsworth Ford (New York : Frederick 
Fairchild Sherman). To the average reader, the 
name of Simeon Soloman conveys nothing ; yet in 
his own time Rossetti and Swinburne befriended 
him warmly, and Burne-Jones spoke of him as " the 
rising genius," and called his designs " as imagina- 
tive as anything he had ever seen." The wonderful 
promise of his early work was never fulfilled ; the 
same vivid imagination that marks his drawings

THE DIAL,

became, in his daily life, a restless fancy that led him 
into all sorts of dissipation, wrecked his friendships, 
and brought his career to a tragic close. Like 
Rossetti, Soloman was a poet-painter. His " Vision 
of Love Revealed in Sleep " has lately been twice 
reprinted, and his exquisite illustrations for "The 
Song of Songs " have appeared in a volume prepared 
for publication by Mrs. Ford. Now we have the 
"Appreciation," with numerous excellent reproduc- 
tions of Solomon's art, — particularly of the ideal 
heads in chalk or pencil, of which he was so prolific 
in his second period, — and selected passages from the 
" Vision," with a critical introduction. All this indi- 
cates the awakening of popular interest, which Mrs. 
Ford's quarto will at once stimulate and gratify. 
There are twenty-three full-page reproductions in 
tint, which fully exhibit the strength and the weak- 
ness of Solomon's achievement. Except possibly in 
a dominant note of sadness, the artist's marred life 
does not in any way affect his work, which suggests 
that of Burne-Jones, at the same time that it is 
strongly original. Both the drawings and the poem 
will well repay the attention which Mrs. Ford asks 
for them, and which her competent criticism and 
well-proportioned exposition do much to focus. 

Each year Miss Elisabeth Luther Cary becomes 
more widely known as an art critic with a keen 
appreciation of many types of work, and a sugges- 
tive and stimulating manner of imparting her ideas 
and opinions. Her latest work, " Artists Past and 
Present" (Moffat, Yard & Co.) contains a dozen 
" random studies " of as many artists, from Jan 
Steen to Miss Mary Cassatt. Most of them, how- 
ever, are contemporary, — the only quality they 
have in common. One of the best sketches is that 
of Carl Larsson, the Swedish painter, with its 
pleasant mingling of biography and criticism. 
Alfred Stevens is treated almost entirely with refer- 
ence to his color-schemes and his emphasis on 
costume ; Jacques Callot — to go back to a seven- 
teenth century engraver — is utilized for a study in 
temperament. An essay on " One Side of Modern 
German Painting " deals with its " resolute indi- 
vidualism, a determination to express the inner life 
of the artist, his temperament and predilections and 
his mood, at whatever cost of technical facility." 
That on " Two Spanish Painters " harks back to 
last winter's exhibitions of the work of Sorolla and 
Zuloaga. All are keen, penetrating, appreciative, 
aud sensible. Three or four illustrations in tint 
accompany each study, and, with a tasteful cover, 
make the volume as attractive in appearance as it 
is stimulating in content. 

"Christmas in Art" (Duffield) is the work of 
Mr. Frederick Keppel, the well-known connoisseur 
of prints and engravings. The many illustrations are 
chiefly reproductions of rare prints of the Nativity 
by fifteenth and sixteenth century artists ; but there 
are some more familiar pictures. Each is accom- 
panied by a paragraph of comment, skilfully con- 
trived to bring out its essential quality or especial 
point of interest. The text discusses, in rambling, 



informal fashion, the pictures and their artists, 
Christmas music and poetry, and quaint Christmas 
customs in many lands. 

Illustrated Nature Books. 

" Dutch Bulbs and Gardens " (Macmillan), with 
pictures in color by Miss Mima Nixon and text by 
the Misses Una Silberrad and Sophie Lyall, is natu- 
rally a book to delight all lovers of flowers and 
gardens ; but the story of bulb-growing in Holland 
is entertaining enough to make a much wider appeal, 
and the authors have taken full advantage of that 
fact to introduce a variety of interests besides the 
horticultural one. The best time to see the gar- 
dens, it seems, is in June, when the great mass of 
the flowering is over, and individual beauties can 
be noticed, when the tall hedges are green, and the 
iris, ranunculus, early gladioli, and many lilies, in 
addition to the spring bulbs, are in bloom. And the 
way to see them is not in a hasty carriage drive, 
but in a leisurely walk with the bulb-grower through 
his domains. Then you will see not merely im- 
pressionistic splashes of wonderful blue or pink or 
yellow ; but also the flowers. Of course the authors 
have visited the bulb-district many times and in 
different seasons. Miss Silberrad writes of the 
present-day aspects of the subject, while Miss Lyall 
tells of the hyacinth and tulip trades in their prime. 
The pictures, in generous number, show us the bulb- 
gardens in all their glow of multi-colored splendor, — 
until we quite forget Miss Silberrad's stern reminder 
that the blossoms are a mere incident, to be ruthlessly 
mown down before their beauty is spent ; for the cul- 
ture and sale of the ugly brown bulbs is the sole 
reason for the existence of so much loveliness. 

Did the acquiring of a spade and a garden bring 
the " Hermit " who writes of " The Garden in the 
Wilderness " ( Baker & Taylor Co.) facility with the 
pen? If so, it must be conceded that for literary 
purposes the spade is more potent than the sword. 
The title of the book is misleading, in respect that 
the author is a woman, and married, and in respect 
that the location of her garden is not a wilderness. 
To be literal, the " Hermit " and her husband are 
artists who met over a bowl of nasturtiums in a New 
York studio, who fell in love, wedded, and moved 
into the country. Her stories of Mr. Schweine- 
hunden the gardener, Vagrant the dog, Marcus 
Aurelius the txirtle, and other country friends, are 
most entertaining. There is plenty of sentiment, 
too ; but the ground-work of the little volume is 
garden-lore. A dainty green binding with nastur- 
tium design, and many half-tones, in addition to 
drawings by the Hermit and " Bentley," illustrate 
the beauties of the garden. 

Anthologies and Year-Books. 
Mr. E. V. Lucas, indefatigable maker of antholo- 
gies, has this year edited a companion volume to 
" The Ladies' Pageant," that happy assembling of 
real and imaginary heroines. He calls it " Some 
Friends of Mine: A Rally of Men" (Macmillan).

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



On the whole, the new book has less of the charac- 
teristic Lucas quality than any of those that have 
preceded it. Perhaps Mr. Lucas does not think 
playful fancy suitable to the consideration of stern 
masculinity. At any rate the nomenclature of his 
portrait gallery is straightforward and unadorned, 
and he has almost entirely excluded fictitious char- 
acters, going to writers like Vasari, Charles Lamb, 
Mr. C. J. Apperley, Mr. S. Baring-Gould, George 
Borrow, and Dr. John Brown, for keen characteri- 
zations of actual persons. A large part of this 
material will be absolutely new to the average 
reader, who will find this volume, if the least witty, 
far from being the least interesting of the Lucas 
anthologies. 

From the wide fields of English and American 
poetry Mr. Willis Boyd Allen has industriously 
culled some of the numberless tributes to the modest 
violet ; and they are gathered in " The Violet Book " 
(George W. Jacobs & Co.). Its pages are strewn 
with " pale violets " and masses of " deep violets " 
adorn its cover. It is a pity that so pretty a con- 
ception should be marred by a tasteless frontispiece 
— which also appears on the cover of the volume. 
"The Book of Christmas," published by the 
Macmillan Co., is an anthology of prose and poetry, 
attractively grouped and entitled, in the fashion that 
has recently brought the anthology again into popu- 
lar favor. A graceful introduction by Mr. Hamilton 
W. Mabie analyzes the Christmas spirit and suggests 
what a true " Book of Christmas " should stand for. 
Scattered through the little book are a dozen appro- 
priate reproductions from the Old Masters, and an 
ornamental title-page for each group of quotations 
has been drawn by Mr. George Wharton Edwards. 

Miscellaneous Gift-Books. 
Two beautiful illustrated volumes from the presses 
of the Tandy-Thomas Co. are based, respectively, on 
the text of " Thanatopsis " and the words of our 
national anthem — if " America " is our national 
anthem. For the latter, Mr. Walter Tittle has 
designed pages richly illuminated and lettered in 
the style of an old missal, to contain the title of the 
volume — "My Country" — a dedication, and a 
brief account of the author and the song. A col- 
ored portrait of Francis Smith follows, and the 
stanzas of the song in facsimile of the author's 
handwriting, framed in illuminated borders. For 
each line of each stanza there is an illustration, or, 
more accurately, a picture suggested by the words. 
Many of these are faithful treatments of some 
striking American scene, — the statue of Liberty in 
New York harbor, Niagara Falls, the Garden of 
the Gods, the Capitol at Washington, — each set 
within an illuminated border. — The pages of 
" Thanatopsis " are of Italian handmade paper, in 
a brown tint. On them are mounted thirty etchings, 
after designs by Mr. Walworth Stilson. Half are 
illustrations ; the others contain the hand-lettered 
text of the poem sorrounded by appropriate decora- 
tions. The book is of quarto size, simply bound in 



brown boards, with parchment back. Mr. Stilson's 
landscapes are varied and beautiful ; and they are 
all full of the solemn majesty that is the dominating 
note of the poem. 

Readers of Miss Mary Caroline Crawford's " St. 
Botolph's Town " published last year, will be glad 
to know that she has continued the history of old 
Boston — why should we not say young Boston? — 
from the dawn of the Revolution, where she left it, 
until the town became a city and thereby entered 
upon another epoch. The new book, therefore, 
covers the formative period, "when the peculiar gen- 
ius of Boston was beginning to find itself in art, in 
politics, and in civic life." Miss Crawford does not 
say much about politics, and the artists rather than 
the arts are her concern. Pursuing much the plan 
of "St. Botolph's Town," she has made seventeen 
related, yet independent, studies of men and move- 
ments. The illustrative material is varied and in- 
teresting : it includes old prints and engravings, por- 
traits, and modern photographs or drawings of his- 
toric sites. " Old Boston Days and Ways " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.), as interpreted by Miss Crawford 
with accuracy, vivacity, and the novelty due to the 
use of a considerable body of new material, are cer- 
tainly not wanting in interest for readers of to-day. 

Several years ago, Mrs. Anna Benneson McMahan 
offered to holiday book-buyers a fanciful little 
volume, telling, with imagined detail, the story of 
the presentation of Shakespeare's "Midsummer 
Night's Dream " at the Christmas revels before 
Queen Bess and her court. This year, in somewhat 
similar vein, she relates " Shakespeare's Love Story," 
weaving into her idyllic picture of his romantic 
adventure such of the sonnets as suit her purpose. 
She does not mean, she explains, to propound a new 
" theory " of their origin ; only to show that, read 
thus in connection with his life, they show him as 
capable of inspired love making as he was of in- 
spired poetry. The publishers, Messrs. A. C. Mc- 
Clurg & Co., have devised a very pretty setting for 
the book. The illustrations are printed separately 
in tint on thin paper, and framed, as it were, in 
tinted borders ; while cover and end-papers carry 
out the same color scheme. 

Fourteen exquisite volumes comprise the output 
of Mr. Thomas B. Mosher for the present holiday 
season. The smaller books include Milton's " Ode 
on the Nativity," Eugene Lee-Hamilton's " Mimma 
Bella," Mr. Austin Dobson's "Proverbs in Porce- 
lain," Browning's " Rabbi Ben Ezra," Baudelaire's 
"Poems in Prose," Pater's "The Child in the 
House," Olive Schreiner's " The Lost Joy," Henley's 
" Rhymes and Rhythms," and " A Little Book for 
John O'Mahony's Friends," by Mrs. Katharine 
Tynan. The five larger books (none of them incon- 
veniently large) are, " Silhouettes," by Mr. Arthur 
Symons ; " A Wayside Lute," by Miss Lizette W. 
Reese; " Felise: A Book of Lyrics," by A. C. Swin- 
burne ; " The Land of Heart's Desire," by Mr. W. B. 
Yeats ; and Francis Thompson's posthumous essay 
on Shelley. Here is good literary fare indeed, and

garnished in a way that appeals to the most fastidious 
taste. As we have often said before, these are the 
ideal books for modest Christmas remembrances. 

Two books of sermons suggested by the life of 
Christ have been issued in illustrated editions. 
"Bethlehem to Olivet" (T. Y. Crowell & Co.), by 
that well-known writer on religious themes, Dr. J. 
R. Miller, is described in the sub-title as " The Life 
of Jesus Christ Illustrated by Modern Painters." 
In reality, however, Dr. Miller has presupposed on 
his reader's part a knowledge of the facts of the 
Bible narrative, and, using them merely as points 
of departure, brings out the message of each incident 
for the world of to-day. For each chapter there is 
a suitable illustration from the work of some noted 
painter. — "With Christ in Palestine " (R. F. Fenno 
& Co.) contains four addresses by Rev. Dr. A. T. 
Schofield, of London, all suggested by a recent trip 
through the Holy Land, and illustrated by photo- 
graphs of the country. 

" The Seven Ages of Childhood" (Moffat, Yard) 
is a book of pictures by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith, 
with verses to accompany them from the versatile 
pen of Miss Carolyn Wells. Miss Wells's verses 
are neat and witty, and Miss Smith's pictures, which 
include large pictures in color and many dainty little 
groups at the top and bottom of the pages, are quite 
as charming as usual. 



The Season's Books for the Young. 



The following is a list of all children's books published 
during the present season and received at the office of 
The Diax up to the time of going to press with this 
issue. The titles are classified in a general way, and 
brief descriptions of most of the books are given. It 
is believed that this list will commend itself to Holiday 
purchasers as a convenient and trustworthy guide to 
the juvenile books of 1909.

Notes. 



" Divorce: A Study in Social Causation," by Professor 
James P. Lichtenberger, is a recent monograph in the 
historical series of Columbia University. 

Carlyle's " Past and Present," with an introduction 
by Mr. G. K. Chesterton, is added by Mr. Henry 
Frowde to the series of " The World's Classics." 

The late Edward Caird's " Essays on Literature," 
first published in 1892, is now reprinted by the Mac- 
millan Co., without change of text, as far as we have 
observed. 

" Hamlet " and " The Tempest " are the two latest 
volumes in " The New Hudson Shakespeare," as edited 
by Messrs. E. C. Black and A. J. George, and published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Professor Martin Schutze of the University of Chi- 
cago, whose " Hero and Leander " has been well received 
by the leading critics, is now completing a poetic drama 
dealing with the subject of Judith and Holofernes. 

Dr. Paul Carus has translated a selection from the 
rhymes of Angelus Silesius, and made an attractive 
little book which is issued by the Open Court Publish- 
ing Co. Both German text and English version are 
given on the same page. 

The reported serious illness of Herr Bjornson lends 
interest to the announcement that his last novel, "Mary," 
published about two years ago, is now added, in a transla- 
tion by Miss Mary Morison, to the English series issued 
in uniform shape by the Macmillan Co. 

Prescott's " Conquest of Mexico," Macaulay's 
" Speeches on Politics and Literature," Trotter's " The 
Bayard of India" (Sir James Outram), and George 
Smith's " Life of William Carey " are the latest edi- 
tions to " Everyman's Library," published by Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. 

From England comes the announcement that King 
Edward has knighted Frederick Macmillan, the present 
head of the English publishing house of Macmillan & 
Company, and a director of The Macmillan Company 
of New York. Mr. Macmillan is the son of the original 
founder, Daniel Macmillan. 

Mr. Rutger B. Jewett, manager of John Lane Com- 
pany, has lately completed an arrangement with Mr. 
Eden Phillpotts by which John Lane Company will, in 
future, be Mr. Phillpotts' publishers in America. The 
first of Mr. Phillpotts' novels to be issued under this 
arrangement was " The Haven." 

" A College Text-Book of Geology " is added to the 
" American Science Series " of Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co., the authors being Professors Thomas C. Cham- 
berlin and Rollin D. Salisbury. It makes a stout 
volume of nearly a thousand pages, amply illustrated, 
and maintaining in every respect the high standard of 
the series to which it belongs. 

Mr. E. Byrne Hackett, who for the past three years 
has been in charge of the publishing department of 
The Baker & Taylor Co., recently severed his con- 
nection with that firm to take charge of the affairs of 
the Yale University Press, with offices in New York 
City. Mr. W. B. Parker, who has had a varied pub- 
lishing experience, will take charge at The Baker & 
Taylor Company. 

Professor J. E. Spingarn's " Critical Essays of the 
Seventeenth Century " is now completed by the publi- 
cation of a third volume, covering the last fifteen years 



1909.]

of the period, and including examples of ten writers, 
among them being Temple, Wotton, Blackmore, Con- 
greve, and Collier. There is a bibliography of the sub- 
ject, and an index to the entire work. Mr. Henry 
Frowde is the publisher. 

A volume of " Reminiscences and Sketches " by Mr. 
Charles Forster Smith, mostly reprinted from periodi- 
cals, is published by Messrs. Smith & Lamar, Nashville. 
Its two dozen numbers include papers upon literary and 
scholastic worthies, on literature and education, and on 
Southern life and character. We note with particular 
pleasure the essays on Charles Kendall Adams and 
Richard Malcolm Johnston. There are a dozen por- 
trait illustrations. 

The celebrated virtuoso Herr Eugen d' Albert has been 
enlisted by the Oliver Ditson Co. to edit their selection 
of the piano compositions of Beethoven for the " Musi- 
cians' Library." The first volume, now published, gives 
us five of the earlier sonatas and a group of seven 
" Bagatelles." A second volume, with examples of the 
later work, will follow, as we are informed concerning 
its contents by the prefatory essay, which discusses the 
selections in both volumes. 

Mr. T. Werner Laurie, the London publisher, an- 
nounces a series of new novels, equal in excellence to 
the long-established six-shilling book of fiction, and 
procurable for the modest sum of two shillings. The 
initial volume in this new venture is to be a story of 
London and Paris by Miss Florence Warden, with the 
title " The Empress of the Andes." Sales three times 
as large as those of the old-time novel will be necessary 
to secure the same profit to author and publisher. 

The " American Publishing Company," doing busi- 
ness at Middlebury, Vermont, issues the following 
announcement : " The Xew Physics. Sound. By 
Joseph Battell. ' Truth crushed to earth shall rise 
again. The eternal years of God are hers.' This book 
demonstrates that sound is corpuscular. The demon- 
stration is complete in every particular. 8vo. 335 
pages. Price 81.25." Possibly some significance may 
be discovered in the fact that this contribution to sci- 
ence comes from the Green Mountains. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. send us the following 
modern language texts : " Deutsche Patrioten in Russ- 
land zur Zeit Napoleons," by E. M. Arndt, edited by 
Professor W. A. Colwell ; " Les Maitres de la Critique 
Litte'raire au XIX. Siecle," being essays by some dozen 
of authors, selected by Professor W. W. Comfort; and 
" L'Age d'Or de la Litterature Frangaise," by Mile. 
Louise Delpit. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a 
volume of " Exercises in French Composition for Schools 
and Colleges," by Mr. William Koren. 

The death, on the 19th of Xovember, of the Rev- 
erend John Bannister Tabb, of Baltimore, removes an 
interesting figure from our literature. Father Tabb had 
a varied career, beginning active life on a blockade- 
runner in the Civil War, and ending it a Roman Catholic 
priest. It was during his first attempt to run the 
blockade that Father Tabb was captured and imprisoned 
at Point Lookout, Maryland, where he made the ac- 
quaintance of Sidney Lanier, a fellow prisoner; this 
was the beginning of a strong friendship between the 
two men. Like Lanier, Father Tabb was passionately 
fond of music, and was himself a musician. As a poet, 
Father Tabb confined himself to the shorter forms of 
lyrical verse. Many of the most characteristic of his 



poems are collected in his volume of " Later Lyrics," 
published by John Lane Company. For a year or more 
before his death, Father Tabb was totally blind ; and this 
affliction was the subject of some of his most touching 
and expressive verses. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish the following 
English texts: " The Essays of Elia," edited by Mr. 
H. E. Coblentz ; Ruskin's " Sesame and Lilies," edited 
by Dr. Charles R. Gaston; and Goldsmith's two famous 
poems (with Gray's " Elegy "), edited by Miss Rose M. 
Barton. Other English texts are "Xarrative and 
Lyric Poems for Students " (Holt), edited by Professor 
S. S. Seward, Jr. ; " Selections from Byron, Wordsworth, 
Shelley, Keats, and Browning" (American Book Co.), 
edited by Messrs. C. T. Cope land and H. M. Rideout; 
and De Quincey's " The Spanish Military Nun " and 
" Revolt of the Tartars " (Frowde), edited by Mr. V. H. 
Collins. 

The richness of illustration which gives " The Inter- 
national Studio " foremost place among present-day art 
magazines is emphasized anew in the latest bound vol 
ume of that periodical, just sent us by the John Lane 
Company. A more varied and interesting feast for the 
art-lover than that set forth in these four hundred pages 
could not easily be found. Every page contains one or 
more half-tone reproductions, and there are twenty-one 
plates in full color. A leaning toward the more bizarre 
tendencies in modern art has always been apparent in 
"The International Studio," yet it is not allowed to 
become predominant. We are especially glad to note 
the increasing attention which American art affairs are 
now receiving in this notable periodical. 

Mr. Emerson Venable has compiled, and the Robert 
Clarke Co. has published, a work called " Poets of 
Ohio," containing not only representative selections, but 
also notes and biographical sketches. Ohio has had 
thirty-three poets deemed worthy of inclusion in this 
volume, and many of them are of more than local 
renown, as may be shown by mentioning the names of 
the Cary sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Piatt, T. B. Read, W. D. 
Howells, and Miss Edith M. Thomas. Altogether, Ohio 
makes almost as creditable a showing in poetry as in 
politics. The book is dignified in appearance and in 
editing, but we must confess that it opens up to the 
imagination an alarming vista of a future procession of 
commonwealths exploited in similar fashion. 

" The Best of the World's Classics " is the title given 
to a ten-volume compilation of extracts from the great 
writers of the world, now published by Messrs. Funk & 
Wagnalls. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge figures as the 
editor of this latest effort to popularize literary culture, 
with Mr. Francis W. Halsey as his assistant, which we 
take to mean that Mr. Halsey has done the lion's share 
of the work. The volumes, which are of pocketable 
size, are devoted one each to Greece and Rome, two 
each to the Continent and America, and four to Great 
Britain and Ireland. There is, of course, no perspective 
in such an allotment, but we never expect it in compila- 
tions of this class. The entire representation of " other 
countries " of the Continent (besides France, Germany 
and Italy) is provided by Erasmus, Cervantes, Ander- 
sen, Turge'nieff, Djsen, and Tolstoy — a queerly- 
assorted half-dozen. The contents of these ten volumes 
are of course good literature, and as such to be recom- 
mended; but they are also for the most part snippets, 
and as such to be avoided. Only prose selections are 
included.

" The portrait [Abraham Lincoln] is an admirable one, and the etch- 
ing is as striking and strong as those which have preceded it. The 
rugged strength of the martyred President's face is well shown and the 
deep lines of care that furrow the brow are significant of the period of 
storm and stress." — New York Herald.

" Mr. JACQUES REICH, 1 Madison Ave., N. Y. 

"Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of seeing your etching of Abraham 
Lincoln, when I took it to be framed for the President, and it is the best 
likeness of him. ... I am the only living body guard of Abraham 
Lincoln, and every feature and expression of the face of that great man 
is as clear to me today, as when he was living. I would love so much to 
have one of those etchings if you will kmdly tell me how I can get one.

THE SONG OF SONGS 

Translated by Thomas Seltzer. 
By HERMANN SUDERMANN nmo. Cloth. $1.40 net; by mail $1.55. 

Sudermann's many dramas and novels may be regarded as merely preliminary studies for this, his masterpiece. It is the story 
of a beautiful girl animated by high ideals and beset by temptations on every 'side. Lilly suggests remotely, Daudet's Sappho and 
Dumas's Camille, in a nobler embodiment. Alone in the world, loving and sympathetic by disposition, she encounters successive- 
ly sordid property, wealth and libertinism, false love, dazzling bohemianism, perfect bliss, then commonplace Philistinism. How 
she threads her way over high peaks and through dark valleys, how she resists and how she succumbs, are the actuating springs of 
a novel incomparable in this decade. 

HUMAN EQUIPMENT; ITS USE AND ABUSE 

fin the Art of Life Series.) 
By EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS 12mo. Cloth. 50c net; by mail 55c. 

This new book deals with the problem, so acutely important in our money-mad society, of the right use of things — the relation 
of man, both individually and collectively taken, to the tools and equipment of civilization. Its central thesis forms a trenchant 
criticism of the persistent superstition that lavish expenditure in careless luxury benefits society. The author shows, both by 
economic argument and historic example, that all use of the power money represents for what is either useless or harmful, forces 
some one to work harder somewhere in the social structure, and unchecked is paid for at a terrible price in the end. Incidentally, 
there is an illuminating discussion of the causes of panics — those "clearing-houses in which we pay our bad debts." The style is 
peculiarly forceful and convincing, and the book is full of wis ^suggestions for the conduct of life. 

BACK TO HAMPTON ROADS 

A supplementary volume to " With the Battle Fleet. " 
By FRANKLIN MATTHEWS Illustrated. nmo. Cloth. $1.50 postpaid. 

This completes the authoritative story of the cruise of the Fleet, taking up the narrative at San Francisco, where " With the 
Battle Fleet " ends. Mr. Matthews was one of the few civilians who went all around the world with our Fleet. He tells of the visits 
to China, Japan, Hawaii, Philippines, Australia and New Zealand; the countries, people, government; the business, customs, 
politics. As our horizon widens a need is created for such a book as this, for it enables us to understand much of the feverish 
striving in the antipodes.

THE SURVIVAL of MAN 

A Study in Unrecognized Human Faculty 
By Sir OLIVER LODGE 

JUST PUBLISHED 

" I have just finished reading the advance sheets for my review," 
writes H. Addington Bruce, author of "The Riddle of Personality." 
••As you know, I don't accept the spiritistic hypothesis. But I have read 
no book since Myers's ■ Human Personality ' that so nearly persuaded 
me. I have not hesitated to give it my unqualified endorsement." 

" The author gives an account," says the Preface, " of many of his 
investigations into matters connected with psychical research during the 
last quarter of a century, with an abridgement of contemporary records. 
His inquiry, following the lines of the Society for Psychical Research, 
began with experimental telepathy ; but the largest section of the book 
treats of automatic writing, trance speech and other instances of tem- 
porary lucidity — for in this department of the subject he considers that 
the most direct evidence for continued personal existence and posthu- 
mous activity will most likely be found.

A new idea in the treatment of history 

KENTUCKY IN THE NATION'S HISTORY 

By ROBERT McNUTT McELROY 

Professor of History in Princeton University. 

Ten years of research preceded the writing of this work and explain the very large proportion of its material now 
first made generally available. The public and private collections of Kentucky, searched for the first time by 
a diligent historian not limited to the needs of a strictly state-history, proved wonderfully productive mines of 
invaluable fact. 

Dr. McElroy frequently was able to develop considerable areas of practically virgin soil, besides adding materially 
to many historical pictures and incidents of renown ; in this way, for example, he enlarges our knowledge even of 
the much-exploited Louisiana Purchase, and the foreign plots growing out 'of the question of the navigation of the 
Mississippi, which led up to it. He furnishes new and interesting material with reference to the Aaron Burr conspir- 
acy; the much studied career of Henry Clay ; the conquest of " the Northwest Territory " by George Rogers Clark, etc. 

The famous Kentucky Resolutions of 1798. the original text from which Calhoun and his fellow nullifiers claimed 
to draw their inspiration, are carefully studied in the light of contemporary documents and newspapers ; and a fac- 
simile of the original, so often misquoted, is presented. 

In brief, this work is one of distinguished original research, of broad and deep perspective, and of permanence. 

Illustrated with maps and historical portraits. 8vo. $5.00 net. By mail $5.40. 



AMERICAN PRIMITIVE 
MUSIC 

By FREDERICK R. BURTON 
The first general survey of the whole subject. A

ERNEST H. SHACKLETON, C.V. 0. 




A COMPLETE RECORD OF THE SHACKLETON 
ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 1907-1909 



2 vol*. Royal 8vo. Cloth, $10 net, per set. 



With twelve full-page color plates, and over 
three hundred marvellous illustrations from 
photographs actually taken by members of 
the expedition, and with three colored maps. 

NOTHING could be more timely than the publication of this 
•wonderful work by a real discoverer whose achievements 
have placed him on a plane with such explorers as Peary and 
Cook. Although his goal lay in the opposite direction, and his 
path led into a much less explored section, he succeeded in locating 
the South Magnetic Pole and came almost within sight of the 
South Pole. 

This is the first exhaustive book on a subject that is creating a 
veritable sensation in all parts of the civilized world at the present 
time. It is not merely made up of newspaper articles and frag- 
mentary sketches, but is Lieutenant Shackleton r s own account of a 
wonderfuUy successful expedition, carefully planned and executed. 
Outside of the important scientific facts and discoveries revealed in 
the book, it is full of exciting adventure, wonderfully illustrated, and 
is undoubtedly the greatest work of exploration and travel of the year.

Religions, Ancient and Modern 

A series of brief monographs upon various systems of religion, each by an eminent author. 

8vo. Cloth. 40 cents net per volume. 
No religion lies in utter isolation from the rest, and the thoughts and principles of 
modern Christianity are attached to intellectual clues which run back through far pre- 
Christian ages to the very origin of human civilization, perhaps even of human existence. 

ANIMISM. By Edward Clodd, author of " The Story of Creation." 

This book is a fascinating sketch of pre-human elements in religion. It is the religion of fear — 
the belief in the activity of evil spirits is the seed of superstition, the source of magic, the spell of sacri- 
fice and bribe to appease the gods. It still lurks in the ritual of modern churches. 

PANTHEISM. By J. Allanson Piction, author of " The Religion of the 

Universe," "The Mystery of Matter," etc. 

Spinoza was the great prophet of Pantheism, which declares that every real thing is God, but this 
does not mean that God is everything that seems to be. 

HINDUISM. By Dr. L. D. Barnett, of the Department of Oriental Literature, 

British Museum. 

The religious creeds and processes of 207,000,000 of Hindus must exert an enormous influence upon 
human society at large. It is well worth a half hour's reading to inquire into the ideas which govern the 
worship of The Great Unseen in India. 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT CHINA. By Professor Herbert A. Giles, LL.D., 

Professor of Chinese at Cambridge University, England. 

An epitome of Chinese morality and religion. " The problem of the universe has never offered the 
slightest difficulty to Chinese philosophers. Before the beginning of all things, there was Nothing. In 
the lapse of ages Nothing coalesced into Unity, the Great Monad. After more ages, the Great Monad 
separated into Duality, the Male and Female Principles in nature ; and then, by a process of biogenesis, 
the visible universe was produced." 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT GREECE. By Jane Harrison, Lecturer at 

Newnham College, Cambridge, England. 

Greek religion is now studied as part of the spiritual history of the human race, not merely as 
mythology. The object of this book is to give an answer to the question, " What in Greek religion is 
characteristically Greek?" 

RELIGION OF BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. By Theophilus G. 

Pinches, late of the British Museum. 

Belief in many Gods was the faith of the people inhabiting the Tigris and Euphrates valley from 
the dawn of history until the Christian era began. This period may be roughly estimated at about 5000 
years. There must be some vitality in an idea which can hold its place for 5000 years. 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT SCANDINAVIA. By w. A. Craigie, M.A., 

Taylorian Lecturer in Oxford University, England. 

The days of the week bear witness to the great gods Thor and Odin. The practice of hero wor- 
ship appears to have been known among the Scandinavians, and the Prose Edda and the Sagas contain 
many counterparts of the mythology of Rome. 

MAGIC AND FETISHISM. By Alfred C. Haddqn, Sc.D., F.R.S., 

University Lecturer in Ethnology, Cambridge, England. 

There can be no doubt that magic practices can act by suggestion through fear and fascination upon 
human victims. The psychology of magic explain this power of suggestion and hypnotism on backward 
people, practised by ignorant or criminal persons.

Religions, Ancient and Modern — Continued 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT EGYPT. By W. M. Flinders Petrie, D.C.L., 
LL.D., Professor of Egyptology, University College, London, England. 
The purpose of religion to the Egyptians was to secure the favor of the gods. There is but little trace 

of negative prayer to avert evil or deprecate evil influences but rather of positive prayer for concrete favors. 

CELTIC RELIGION. By Professor Edward Anwyl, Professor of Welsh at the 

University College, Aberystwith. 

As prehistoric archaeology has come to throw more light on the early civilization of Celtic lands, it 
has become possible to interpret Celtic religion from a thoroughly modern viewpoint. 

MYTHOLOGY OF ANCIENT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. By Charles 

Squire, author of " The Mythology of the British Isles." 

Celtic tradition reflects the religious conceptions of our earliest articulate ancestors. Many fascinat- 
ing side issues are briefly touched upon in this little book. 

ISLAM. By Ameer Ali, Syed, M.A., CLE., late Judge of His Majesty's High 

Court of Judicature in Bengal. 

This little book vibrates with sincerity. It is an explanation of Mohammedanism from the inside. 
The latest born system is Islam and its cardinal principles are the same as those of Christianity. It proves 
that the eternal principles of human conduct constitute the vitalizing force of all great world religions. 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT ROME. By Cyril Bailey, M.A., Baliol College, 

Oxford, England. 

Men's natural surroundings and occupations influence their religion. Domestic worship was the 
historical and logical origin of the Roman religion. Rome was an agricultural community and the 
institutions of Rome, legal as well as religious, all point to the household (familia) as a religious unity of 
organization. 

JUDAISM. By Israel Abrahams, M.A., Lecturer in Talmudic Literature in 

Cambridge University, England. 

The psychology of the Jew is here sketched by a master hand and Judaism is presented as life 
rather than as a creed or a church. 

PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND NATURE OF RELIGION. By 

James Leuba, Bryn Mawr College. 

An exposition by an acknowledged authority on the nature of mental power and its relation to the 
origin of religion. 

RELIGION OF ANCIENT PALESTINE. By Stanley A. Cook, MA. 

The aim of this book is to furnish a fairly self-contained description of general religious conditions, 
particularly in the latter half of the second Millennium, B.C. The facts have been secured from external 
and non-biblical resources. 

SHINTO, THE ANCIENT RELIGION OF JAPAN. By w. G. Aston, 
C.M.G.. D.Lit. 

It is well to know something of the early spiritual food of a nation which in these latter days has 
reached a full and vigorous manhood. 

EARLY CHRISTIANITY. By S. B. Slack, MA. 

To sketch early Christianity is a difficult task, because most readers will begin with their beliefs 
already formed. When a reader starts with an open mind, he is usually grateful for any new information 
he acquires, but in this case old ideas must first be eradicated before new ones can be implanted. 

MYTHOLOGIES of ANCIENT MEXICO and PERU. By Lewis Spence. 

In this study of Mexican and Peruvian mythology, the reader is introduced into a sphere of the most 
fascinating interest, — the attitude towards the eternal verities of the people of a new and isolated world. 

EARLY BUDDHISM. By T. W. Rhys Davids, LL.D., Ph.D. 

The dominant creed of a large fraction of mankind must possess much interest for the student of 
psychology. Phenomena of a similar kind, though not quite the same, are well authenticated in the 
lives of all men of deep religious experience.

WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS. 

An exceptionally sane and well-informed 
article upon the shortcomings of our newspaper 
press is contributed by " an independent journal- 
ist " to the last issue of the " American Journal 
of Sociology." The writer is fully sensitive to 
the evils of our current practice, but does not 
indulge in that wholesale condemnation which 
weakens the force of so many attacks upon 
journalistic methods. His point of view is 
stated in the following sentence : " The same 
newspaper arouses your enthusiasm at one time, 
so that you write, or are tempted to write, to the 
editor warmly thanking him for his noble efforts, 
and provokes your anger and disgust at another 
time, so that you are ready to denounce it at the 
breakfast table as a poisoner of the public mind 
and an enemy of decency and truth." It is just 
as well to see both sides of the shield, and to 
recognize the indispensable service which even 
the " yellowest" of newspapers may perform for 
us, as well as to deplore its sensational or vicious 
tendencies. Unless we bestow praise where 
praise is due, our indictment will be quashed by 
the common sense of the average reader. 

The plea upon which journalists excuse most 
of their aberrations from truth and decency is 
that they are giving the public what it wants, 
and that not otherwise may they keep their 
heads above water in the struggle for existence. 
At least, not otherwise may they conduct profit- 
able business enterprises, and secure the circu- 
lation in which, even if got by questionable 
methods, lies all their potentiality for good. 
The plea is a specious one, and is often allowed 
without very close scrutiny ; our present writer 
takes the bull by the horns, and asks if the pub- 
lic really does want the things which are dear to 
the heart of a great many of our reckless press- 
men. " Does the public demand fabrication, 
misrepresentation for the sake of effect, sensa- 
tionalism in the news columns?" "Can it be 
supposed that readers are attracted by crazy, 
silly, and grotesque headlines, by headlines that 
bear no relation to the text, by a ridiculous mis- 
use of words ? " "To let correspondents drool, to 
fill space with empty interviews, to say a thing 
three times over, is not to give the public what 
it wants. Whatever we may choose to blame

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



the public for in the shortcomings of the great 
newspaper, there is not the least ground for 
debiting it with a preference for dull verbiage, 
for inflated egotism in correspondents, for the 
multiplication of words. The notion of some 
publishers or editors that a paper without 
bedlamite headlines, without inane and empty 
1 despatches,' with excruciating and misdirected 
« humor,' would lose circulation, is devoid of all 
foundation in experience." All these things 
may attract for the moment, but they soon 
become a weariness to the sense ; and even the 
meanest intelligence, although dulled by use, is 
likely to revolt against them after their novelty 
has worn off. We cannot carry credulity so far 
as to believe that any considerable body of 
readers will, in the long run, prefer a " faked " 
account to a truthful one, an imaginary to a real 
interview, a spurious illustration to an authentic 
one (or even to none at all), or a blotched and 
unsightly page to one whose contents lend them- 
selves to continuous reading. 

The truth of the matter seems to be that most 
of these atrocities have been forced upon an over- 
acquiescent public, and that the only demand for 
them is a demand that has been artificially 
brought into being by insistence and iteration. 
That the appetite for these things grows by 
what it feeds on, is true only within limits ; that 
it can prove a lasting appetite, is contrary to the 
most elementary psychology. Taste may be 
spoiled, and intelligence blighted, by such de- 
vices ; but they will hardly create a fool's para- 
dise of self-satisfaction. Our writer's alterna- 
tive recommendation for the discredited form- 
ula is to " trust the public," to " credit it with 
sanity and fairness." There could be no per- 
manent loss in the substitution of the new motto 
for the old one, although there might be some 
sacrifice for the time being. " Temporary loss 
there might be in a given case, as in rejecting 
improper advertisements, or in losing the pat- 
ronage of an industrial Bourbon and arrogant 
plutocrat. But in the end independence, in- 
telligence, reasonable courage, integrity, and 
efficiency bring their reward in journalism as in 
everything else." 

The same shallow plea of giving the public 
what it wants is put forward by our theatrical 
managers no less plaintively than by our news- 
paper proprietors. The fruition of this policy, 
as far as the newspaper case is concerned, has 
been an almost complete loss of public confi- 
dence in the trustworthiness of news columns and 
in the sincerity of editorial comment. Leader- 
ship has been abdicated, and journalism is con- 



ducted with an eye single to the demands of the 
counting-room. In the theatrical case, the 
process of demoralization has gone still farther, 
and the " pocket nerve " itself shows signs of 
becoming affected. The public has long been 
given what it wanted, in pursuance of the short- 
sighted plan of appealing only to its caprices and 
of artificially stimulating its lower instincts, 
until now it plainly shows signs of not wanting 
the fare offered, and of being incapable of digest- 
ing anything more nutritious. The popular 
stage, long since declared bankrupt of ideas and 
of morals, now seems to be facing bankruptcy 
of the material sort that gives pause even to its 
commercialized managers. Its devices pall upon 
a public that has been sedulously diverted from 
the permanent things of the drama, and the 
apathy is loudly bewailed as the basest of in- 
gratitude toward those who have sought only to 
please it. The drama will again come to its own, 
we make no doubt ; but its regeneration will not 
be accomplished in a day. The reformation will 
begin when its sponsors learn to make self- 
respect, rather than box-office receipts, the pre- 
vailing motive in their activities. 

The pernicious influence of the attempt to 
give the public what it wants, instead of giving 
it what it ought to have, may be seen in other 
activities than those of journalism and the 
drama. And always we find the same resort to 
artificial stimulation in unworthy directions. 
As we have said before, taste grows by what 
it feeds on, within certain limits ; but when fed 
upon garbage, it ceases to grow at all after a 
while, then revolts at the offering, but finds that 
it has lost its appetite for better food. The sort 
of music that is found lying about the piano in 
the average household of young people, the 
slangy and silly speech which these young 
people affect and which is all they have at their 
command, the false and highly-colored fiction 
which is the staple of their reading, — these are 
all familiar results of the deplorable aim of giv- 
ing the public what it wants. It is an aim 
shared in by many classes of caterers, and the 
acquisition of the dollar is the chief apology 
offered for its pursuit. 

When the public itself becomes the caterer, 
as in the case of park concerts and free libra- 
ries and schools, there is no shirking the respon- 
sibility involved, for the plea that "one must 
live " may not here be urged. Democracy 
becomes an exquisite absurdity if it be taken to 
mean that in these matters there is to be no 
guidance, no attempt to uplift the general taste, 
no function higher than that of supplying an

untrained demand. This is too large a subject 
for discussion in a single paragraph, and we 
will merely note our belief that here the public 
often fails lamentably in its duties. This is 
especially true in the matter of public education, 
which for so long has yielded to the twofold 
clamor for the practical and the agreeable that 
a whole generation has already been weakened 
in fibre and another generation is at present 
undergoing the same lax training based upon 
the same shallow pedagogy. A misty philoso- 
phy, a doctrinaire method, and an infusion of 
philistine ideals, are everywhere doing their 
enervating or disintegrating work in our schools. 
The public is getting what it wants, or what it 
thinks it wants, to its own undoing as far as the 
real purposes of life are concerned, and the pro- 
test of sanity is that of a voice crying in the 
wilderness. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The question of a British Academy of 
Letters is discussed again by the London "Times," 
which is prompted thereto by a correspondent who 
thinks it high time such an institution were estab- 
lished. Advocates of a British Academy are wont 
to point to the French Academy as in itself a suffi- 
cient argument for a similar society in Great Britain. 
But the French Academy is a natural and spontane- 
ous growth, starting in 1629 in a series of informal 
meetings of eight men of letters in Paris, and form- 
ally recognized and permanently established six 
years later, by Cardinal Richelieu, for the control of 
the French language and the guidance of French lit- 
erary taste. How is such a body to be created in 
cold blood in England ? And, if created, who would 
recognize its authority ? The French have a genius 
for organization in art and letters ; they carry their 
political instinct, or it carries them, into those 
domains ; but their over-Channel neighbors, with all 
their genius for organization in governmental 
matters, and their respect for civil authority, are 
intolerant of dictation or control in art and letters, 
as is rather clearly and amusingly illustrated by 
their fretful chafing under the yoke of a censorship 
of plays. The " Times " is inclined to think that a 
British Academy, like many clubs, would be carried 
on and controlled by bores and busy idlers, because 
other men would be too engrossed with their own 
more pressing affairs to give their time ; and these 
bores would crown the books of bores, not from cor- 
rupt motives, but from a natural affinity for boredom 
and all its works. There seems at present little 
danger that the free scope of individual genius, or 
even the pyrotechnic tendencies of the most startling 
eccentricity, will soon be hampered and suppressed 
by any such arbiter of taste as that immortal Forty 
so powerful in the French aristocracy of letters. 



The retirement of an independent journal- 
ist, the reliquishment of his chosen task on the part 
of Professor Goldwin Smith, has attracted an amount 
of attention that would have been highly flattering 
to a man susceptible to flattery. No publicist's pen 
has ever earned a better right to honored repose than 
that of this sturdy octogenarian citizen of the world. 
Characteristic indeed was the inscription he chose 
for that handsome seat of polished stone which in 
the early days of Cornell University he, the former 
Regius professor of history at Oxford, and at that 
time the honorary professor of history at Cornell, 
caused to be built under a wide-spreading tree on 
the campus. " Above all nations is humanity " ran 
the legend on its back. The humanist who devised, 
6r selected, that inscription also gave to the infant 
library of the young college his own collection of ten 
thousand volumes, sending back to England for the 
books when he discovered the sore need of Cornell. 
But the publicity given to the act by the American 
press disgusted him, and he complained that he was 
being made ridiculous in the eyes of England, where 
it would be held as utterly absurd to speak of his 
modest collection as a " library." Like all men with 
the gift of penetration and a command of language, 
he has made his enemies ; but one strongly suspects 
that he prefers the anathemas of the unintelligent to 
their commendation. It is greatly to be hoped that 
cessation from routine work on Professor Smith's 
part will not mean a total suspension of writing 
activity. 

The vogue of the colored illustration, 
which was spoken of by our London correspondent, 
in our last issue, as so marked a feature of this sea- 
son's holiday publications in England, may perhaps 
be attributed not entirely to the artistic merits of the 
pictures, which are often slight, but more correctly 
to the relief experienced by the eye in passing from 
the monotonous and trying black-and-white of the 
printed page and the ordinary illustration to the 
varied and often restful colors found in Nature. 
Oculists now assure us that the harmful effect of the 
at present ubiquitous moving-picture show is due, not 
to the " flickering " of the scene, but to the strain 
caused by too-long contemplation of white light 
broken only by black lines and surfaces. The vibra- 
tions coming from the illuminated screen are con- 
stant ; whereas in viewing a landscape, or a football 
game, or the performance of a play, the optic nerve 
responds to color-vibrations of great variety of rapid- 
ity, differing perhaps by hundreds of trillions in a 
second. Therefore, unless the kinetoscope people 
take a hint from the photographers and illustrators 
in color, the nervous headaches and the partial 
paralysis of the organs of vision now complained of 
by those who have contracted the moving-picture 
habit will seriously affect the profits of the business. 
But it is likely to be many a day before either the 
colored illustration or the colored moving film will 
be artistically unexceptionable, however commend- 
able from a hygienic point of view.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



The origin of an old song, the song known to 
thousands, if not to millions, as " Old Grimes," is 
now revealed in Mr. Dwight C. Kilbourn's " History 
of the Bench and Bar of Litchfield County, Con- 
necticut." Those who have heard the quaint rhymes 
sung in childhood will recall their comic mingling 
of Old Grimes's virtues and the peculiarities of his 
person or costume, as — 

" He lived in peace with all mankind, 
In friendship he was true ; 
His coat had pocket-holes behind, 
His pantaloons were blue." 

The authorship of the song is now traced to a 
source sufficiently distinguished to excuse, if excuse 
be needed, this brief paragraph on the subject. The 
Hon. Albert G. Green, of Rhode Island, United 
States senator, and otherwise noted, studied law in 
his youth at the law school then flourishing in the 
town of Litchfield. A fugitive slave from Virginia 
— who had taken the name of his former master, 
William Grimes — was the proprietor of a small 
barber-shop in the same town ; and at the negro's 
request that Mr. Green should make some verses for 
him, the young man, who was an inveterate rhyme- 
ster on all sorts of themes, turned out the doggerel 
known now for nearly a century (for that was in 
1812) as "Old Grimes." The runaway slave's 
later years were spent in New Haven, where he is 
said to have shaven and shorn the Yale students as 
he formerly had the Litchfield law students. He 
is also said to have published a pamphlet sketch of 
his life, with a portrait, and to have died at New 
Haven about 1859. 

A NEW DEPARTURE IN READING-ROOMS win8 the 

admiring approval of visitors to the new Smith 
College Library, which, through the generosity of Mr. 
Carnegie, of alumnae and friends, and of the trustees 
of the Rockefeller Education Fund, now furnishes 
the students and faculty with the facilities so long 
conspicuously absent at that institution of learning. 
The reading-room in question is not the general 
reading-room, and is not the reference room, nor 
the periodical room ; but it is a far more inviting 
apartment, designed to attract readers who read for 
the pure love of good literature, and not because 
certain books or chapters are " prescribed." The 
atmosphere is that of the private, not of the public, 
library ; the books on the wall-shelves are standard 
authors, and will eventually number about twenty- 
five hundred volumes presented by classes or by 
friends of the college. This quiet sanctum, with its 
"still air of delightful studies," might well receive 
a more distinctive, more aptly descriptive name than 
that of " Standard Authors Room "; but such at 
present is its designation. It was furnished by 
Mr. Clifford Gallagher, of Boston, in memory of his 
daughter Edith, of the class of 1907. It is not 
impossible that Mr. Gallagher's wise generosity may 
have effected more for the cause of literature at 
Smith than if he had given ten times as much money 



in founding a professorship for the teaching of those 
English authors who now make their mute appeal 
from the shelves of the Standard Authors Room. 

A poet as his own parodist is not met with 
every day in the week. A Poe parody on the 
already much-parodied " Raven " has apparently 
come to light in a New York auction-room. At 
Anderson's recently there was sold a copy of the 
first edition of "The Raven and Other Poems," 
uncut and "in the original wrappers," and having 
with it a manuscript copy of verses in the same 
metre and style as " The Raven." These verses 
are thought to be in Poe's handwriting and also to 
be of his own composing. They certainly have the 
Poe swing or " lilt." There are eight stanzas, 
which have now found their way into print, and of 
which the first may here be reproduced as a sample. 

" Leave it not so dark, uncertain ! lift again the fallen cur- 
tain! 
Let us once again the mysteries of that haunted room 

explore ! 
Hear once more that fiend infernal, that grim visiter (sic) 

nocturnal ! 
Earnestly we long to learn all that befalls that bird of 
yore. 

Oh, then tell us something more.'' 

The despairing " Nevermore " of the original poem 
duly reappears at the end of several of the stanzas 
of this parody or sequel. 

• • • 

Father Tabb, the blind poet, whose death was 
briefly noted in our last issue, left behind him the 
memory of a sweet and strong and beautiful person- 
ality. His exquisite bits of verse, always sententious, 
often whimsical, but touched with true poetic feeling, 
are known to thousands and have received the tribute 
of high praise on both sides of the Atlantic. Less 
familiar may be his Lamb-like fondness for the 
harmless pun. Like Lamb, he could make his own 
misfortunes the subject of a merry jest, but was care- 
ful never to wound with his wit the sensibilities of 
others. One day, when his sight was failing with 
alarming rapidity, he told his students (at St. Charles's 
College, near Ellicott City, Maryland) that he was 
planning to go to Baltimore and intended to take his 
two weakest pupils with him — which stirred high 
hopes in the breasts of the smaller boys. But these 
hopes were disappointed, though the promise was 
kept, for Father Tabb went unattended to consult 
an oculist. . . . 

A TROLLEY LIBRARY FOR WORKING PEOPLE is 

forcibly advocated by Mr. Henry F. Marx, librarian 
of the Easton (Pa.) Public Library. His plan 
somewhat resembles that already in successful oper- 
ation in Washington County, Md., and more than 
once approvingly noticed by us. Instead of a book- 
wagon, such as now makes its periodical expeditions 
from Hagerstown, Mr. Marx would have his wheeled 
library take the form of an electric car, which, as 
he believes, could for a small outlay be purchased 
and equipped with several thousand volumes of 



1909.] 



THE D1AJL

suitable literature ; and then, in order to give the 
hard-working tax-payer a proper return for his 
money, Mr. Marx would have his electrically pro- 
pelled library run in on sidings near large depart- 
ment stores and mills for the noon hour, to meet 
the convenience and attract the attention of book- 
hungry employees. Pennsylvania, with its 3644 
miles of street railway, he thinks easily able to in- 
stitute a trolley-car free circulating library system. 
To furnish this service an hour and a half daily to 
busy mill hands and shop girls, and others similarly 
occupied, would cost, estimates Mr. Marx, S557 a 
year, including mileage of sixty-six miles a week, 
lighting, heating, wages, and repairs. If this esti- 
mate is correct, and if it includes cost and care of 
books, one can hardly think of a better use to which 
library funds could be applied. 

Tax-remission for educational purposes may 
at first have a strange sound to those who are more 
familiar with tax-raising for the same praiseworthy 
ends. Professor David Y. Thomas, of the University 
of Arkansas, pleads forcibly, in the November 
*' North American Review," for the repayment to 
the Southern States of the sixty-eight million dollars 
collected as a cotton tax in 1861-1868. The con- 
stitutionality of the tax, which varied at different 
times from one to three cents a pound on this lead- 
ing agricultural product of the South, has often been 
seriously questioned ; and since our government has 
before now paid back other doubtfully legal tax 
levies, and since also it would now be difficult if not 
impossible to hunt up all the cotton-tax payers, or 
their heirs, the writer urges the Congressional appro- 
priation of the amount of this tax as a Lincoln 
Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Southern 
Education. Such a procedure, commendable at any 
time, would be especially fitting in this Lincoln cen- 
tennial year. 

Scotland's recapture of a rare edition of 
Burns's early poems is reported from Boston, 
where, at the auction sale of the library of the late 
James Brown, the Boston publisher, an octavo vol- 
ume entitled " Robert Burns's Poems, Chiefly in the 
Scottish Dialect," and printed by John Wilson at 
Kilmarnock in 1786, when the poet was twenty- 
seven years old, was knocked down at SI 025 to Mr. 
George Clark of Kilmarnock. The buyer, recently 
come from his home in the Burns country, chanced 
to hear of the impending sale of this rare and valu- 
able book, and made haste to secure the treasure for 
the sake of restoring it to its proper home. Of this 
one item of plunder, at least, wrested from Europe 
by American wealth, our national conscience is now 
clear. 

The abuses of dialect-writing are touched 
upon in a short and well-conceived article (" Dialect 
in Fiction," by Mr. W. Harold Thomson) in a late 
number of "The Author." The excessive strain put 
upon the plain reader by some ultra-dialecticians is 
justly deprecated by the writer of the article. 



" Dialect suggested," he well says, " is in every way 
more artistic than dialect written phonetically, and 
I think I am correct when I say that he who writes 
most broadly is he who knows least about it. In- 
deed, any attempt to reproduce on paper the exact 
pronunciation and intonation of a man speaking in 
the vernacular must almost certainly be unsuccess- 
ful ; and should it be successful no good purpose is 
served, for the reader is irritated by the difficulty 
of construing sense from the printed words, and the 
writer, being the unconscious cause of this irritation, 
is made to suffer." How many readers must have 
been vexed by the persistence of some writers in 
indulging in dialectic forms that appeal only to the 
eye ! Why, for example, is "vittles " preferred by 
them to " victuals " ? Such senseless practices make 
their stories look more like the tracts of the Simpli- 
fied Spelling Society than a contribution to literature. 

The new versus the old in library manage- 
ment has been pithily expressed by Chicago's new 
librarian, Mr. Henry E. Legler. " The old-fashioned 
idea of the duty of a librarian," he is reported as 
saying in a discussion of his own theories, which are, 
one hopes, soon to be put into practice, " was to save 
the books. The modern notion is that it is his busi- 
ness to get the books worn out. The books are our 
capital. We cannot afford to let this capital lie idle 
on the shelves. We must put it out at interest. 
The three great problems of the modern library are 
— first, distribution ; second, distribution ; and third, 
distribution." This is excellent, provided only the 
wearing-out process does not so far outstrip replace- 
ment that the readers shall be reduced to the neces- 
sity of seeking intellectual sustenance in the calf- 
bound volumes of the U. S. Government Reports, in 
the Proceedings of the Society for the Promotion of 
Pedantry, or in the occasional publications of the 
Simplified Spelling Board. 

A NEW PLAY BY MADAME SARAH BERNHARDT, 

who has written plays before this, besides trying her 
hand at painting and sculpture and memoir-writing 
and tiger-taming and heaven knows what not, is 
announced for production at the Theatre des Arts 
in Paris. The play was written in the summer vaca- 
tion of the wonderful woman who for the preceding 
eleven months had been acting eight or nine times 
a week in other people's plays ; and it has not yet 
received a name. Those who have witnessed her 
" Adrienne Lecouvreur," thrown off in a mood of 
dissatisfaction with the long-established version of 
that actress's history, will not doubt that Mme. 
Bernhardt's vacation has been spent to good purpose.

Library methods of handling municipal sta- 
tistics are coming into vogue among the more wide- 
awake communities. The scientific, if sometimes 
painfully rigid, classification of all printed matter, the 
perfecting of the card-catalogue, and the elaboration 
of the reference and cross-reference system of index- 
ing, have greatly aided those who would like to be 



504 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



able to legislate intelligently and wisely and progres- 
sively. The latest bureau of municipal statistics is 
to have its abode at the University of Illinois, where 
Professor James W. Garner, head of the department 
of political science and a member of the Urbana 
City Council, has been appointed by a convention of 
Illinois mayors as organizer and director of the new 
bureau. The increasing adoption by governmental 
bodies of what are virtually modern library methods 
for keeping themselves informed of what is being 
done and what it is best to do in matters of civic 
administration, is an involuntary and a sincere com- 
pliment to the leaders in library science. 



FROM LIT ERAR Y LONDON. 

(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 
Nothing has yet been published, I think, either in 
the English or American newspapers, concerning Mr. 
Swinburne's literary remains; although it has been 
hinted that Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton will write 
his life. As a matter of fact, I do not believe the 
book will ever be written. Mr. Watts-Dunton has 
undoubted genius, and would make a beautiful book 
upon his friend ; but one of his talents is a talent for 
procrastination. He waited years before he pub- 
lished his charming novel " Aylwin." Any other 
writer would have sent it into the world years be- 
fore. " Aylwin " has been a tremendous success in 
this country, and I suppose also in America. I 
believe I am right in saying that in a series of well- 
printed shilling books which have sold to the extent 
of many thousands in England, " Aylwin " has sold 
best of all. Then Mr. Watts-Dunton promised us 
another novel, which it was understood at least two 
years ago was quite ready for publication. He ar- 
ranged with another publisher for a volume to be 
called by the picturesque title "The Old Familiar 
Faces," which would have introduced us to many of 
his old friends whose obituaries he wrote in " The 
Athenaeum," brilliant little monographs that some of 
us have taken pains to convey to our scrap-books. 
In view of these facts, it does not seem likely that 
Mr. Watts-Dunton will ever really carry out his in- 
tention of writing the biography of his good friend 
and brother poet. 

Meanwhile I am in a position to state — and here 
make, I believe, the first announcement of the fact 
— that there will be two volumes of Mr. Swinburne's 
essays given to the public at an early date. One 
of these is a volume devoted to some of Shakespeare's 
great contemporaries ; for Mr. Swinburne's interest 
in the Elizabethan Dramatists was profound. There 
was no subject upon which he so delighted to con- 
verse in that pleasant library of his in which it was 
my privilege to discuss the subject with him. His 
window overlooked the garden of the house at Put- 
ney, and there were points at which it recalled to 
me 0. W. Holmes's library overlooking the Charles 
River at Boston, where also I have been. The sec- 



ond volume of Mr. Swinburne's writings will consist 
of a gathering together of his various uncollected 
papers, including the masterly essay on Dickens 
that he wrote for the " Quarterly Review," his first 
signed contribution in that great periodical. Among 
other Dickens matter in this volume will be the 
essay that Swinburne wrote as an introduction to 
" Oliver Twist," for a new edition of Dickens pub- 
lished in New York. 

This does not exhaust my store of information 
concerning Mr. Swinburne and his posthumous 
works. Apart from the two volumes that I have 
referred to, there are to be no less than seven little 
books which will for the present be privately printed 
by Mr. Thomas Wise, the well-known collector of 
London. Only a few copies have been printed from 
type, and I do not suppose that more than two 
copies have reached America. The series contains, 
for example, a prose romance entitled " The Mar- 
riage of Mona Lisa "; there is another, also in prose, 
entitled " The Portrait "; and a third prose volume 
is entitled " The Chronicle of Fredegond." There 
are also before me — I count them of priceless 
value — four little pamphlets containing ballads. 
One is entitled "Margaret"; a second, "Lord 
Scales "; a third, " Lord Soules "; a fourth, "Border 
Ballads." No doubt these seven little books will 
ultimately be given to the public — probably in a 
single volume ; but they are practically unobtainable 
to-day. I think, therefore, that many of Swinburne's 
admirers will be glad to see one of these ballads 
printed in The Dial, although it is of considerable 
length. It may be remembered that, as a North- 
umbrian, Mr. Swinburne was brought up in that 
border-land between England and Scotland which 
inspired this aspect of his poetry. 

DURIESDYKE. 

A BALLAD. 

The rain rains sair on Duriesdyke, 

Both the winter through and the spring ; 

And she that will gang to get broom thereby 
She shall get an ill thing. 

The rain rains sair on Duriesdyke, 

Both the winter and the summer day ; 

And he that will steek his sheep thereby 
He shall go sadly away. 

" Between Crossmuir and Duriesdyke 
The fieldhead is full green ; 
The shaws are thick in the fair summer, 
And three wellheads between. 

" Flower of broom is a fair flower, 
And heather is good to play." 
she went merry to Duriesdyke, 
But she came heavy away. 

" It 's I have served you, Burd Maisry, 
These three months through and mair ; 
And the little ae kiss I gat of you, 
It pains me aye and sair. 

" This is the time of heather-blowing, 
And that was syne in the spring ; 
And the little ae leaf comes aye to red, 
And the corn to harvesting."

The first kiss their twa mouths had, 

Sae fain she was to greet ; 
The neist kiss their twa months had, 

I wot she laughed fu' sweet. 

" Cover my head with a silken hood, 
My feet with a yellow claith ; 
For to stain my body wi' the dyke-water, 
God wot I were fu' laith." 

He 's happit her head about wi' silk, 

Her feet with a gowden claith ; 
The red sendal that was of price, 

He 's laid between them baith. 

They did not kiss in a noble house, 

Nor yet in a lordly bed ; 
But their mouths kissed in the high heather, 

Between the green side and the red. 

" I have three sailing ships, Maisry, 
For red wheat and for wine ; 
The maintopmast is a bonny mast, 
Three furlongs off to shine. 

" The foremast shines like new lammer, 
The mizzenmast like steel ; 
Gin ye wad sail wi' me, Maisry, 
The warst should carry ye weel." 

" Gin I should sail wi' you, Lord John, 
Out under the rocks red. 
It 's wha wad be my mither's bower-maiden 
To hap saft her feet in bed ? 

'' Gin I should sail wi' you, Lord John, 
Out under the rocks white, 
There 's nane wad do her a very little ease 
To hap her left and right." 

It fell upon the midwinter, 

She gat mickle scaith and blame ; 
She 's bowed hersell by the white water 

To see bis ships come hame. 

She 's leaned hersell against the wind, 

To see upon the middle tide ; 
The faem was fallen in the running wind, 

The wind was fallen in the waves wide. 

" There's nae moon by the white water 

To do me ony good the day ; 

And but this wind a little slacken, 

They shall have a sair seaway. 

" O stir not for this nied, baby, 
stir not at my side ; 
Ye '11 have the better birth, baby r 
Gin ye wad but a little abide." 

Readers of The Dial will perhaps be interested 
in seeing the following hitherto unpublished lines 
by Mr. Swinburne, which form a dedication to the 
faithful friend of years whose full name is Walter 
Theodore Watts-Dunton. Ten copies of this little 
dedication have been printed by Mr. Wise, of 
London, for the benefit of his friends ; and the orig- 
inal MS., I believe, is in the possession of a citizen 
of Chicago, Mr. Wrenn.

Three times each year we open our paper with a 
lively expectation that a certain number of our 
acquaintances will have changed their designation 
from plain " Mr." into " Lord " or " Sir." The 
three occasions are the late Queen's Birthday, May 
24th ; the present King's Birthday, November 9th ; 
and the first of January of each year. The New 
Year's honors, as they are called, are generally 
understood to be restricted to official persons ; but 
in May and November we may always look to see 
well-known names. My interest in these is mainly 
restricted to literature. Were it discreet, one could 
reveal some astonishing facts with regard to people 
who have not got titles but want them, and others 
who have been offered titles and have refused them. 
Three of the leading English novelists of our day, 
for example, have all refused a knighthood. Yet it 
is hardly a secret that there are several novelists 
flourishing among us who would almost give their 
ears to be possessed of one. The list that has 
recently been sent out contains one name generally 
esteemed alike in English literature and English 
journalism. This is Dr. Robertson Nicoll, now Sir 
Robertson Nicoll, or Sir William Nicoll as he will 
prefer to be called. His title is a recognition of his 
stalwart defence of Mr. Lloyd George's Budget; 
but it is as an acute literary critic and scholar that 
I most admire the new knight. His knowledge of 
nineteenth-century literature is probably greater 
than that of any living contemporary, and some day 
we shall see good evidence of this in the successive 
volumes of his history of that period. The first 
volume will not appear for at least two years, how- 
ever. 

I do not attach much importance to the subject of 
the best-selling books; for the best-selling books, at 
least in this country, are usually the worst written. 
But it may interest American readers to know of cer- 
tain books that have been reprinted in this country 
duringthe past few days. They include Sven Hedin's 
and Shackleton's well-known volumes ; also, several 
of the color books that I named in my last letter, 
including the Omar Khayyam of Dulac. There is 
also a brisk sale for Mr. De Morgan's new novel, 
the inordinate length of which seems not to have 
deterred the book-buyer. Mr. Kipling's latest vol- 
ume also is having an extraordinary sale.

A biography of Timothy Flint, pioneer, missionary, 
author (1780-1840), will be issued shortly by the 
Arthur H. Clark Co. of Cleveland. It is the work of 
Professor J. E. Kirkpatrick, of Washburn College, 
Topeka, Kansas, and will be the first published life of 
a man who was an important factor in the early history 
of the central, southern, and western parts of the United 
States. The author, by diligent research work, has 
brought to light a great deal of new material pertaining 
to the early history of the Lnited States, and the book 
should prove a distinct addition to our permanent his- 
torical data.

A Great Mind in the Making.* 

The Emerson centenary, in 1903, was marked 
in the book world by the publication of a com- 
plete annotated edition of Emerson's works, and 
it was intended to supplement his more formal 
writings with the journals whose daily entries 
he drew upon for the raw material — and not 
seldom, too, for the finished fabric — of his 
lectures, which were afterward further elabor- 
ated for appearance in book form. Mr. James 
Elliot Cabot, the literary executor of the Con- 
cord sage, felt himself too old to undertake the 
editing of these journals, which cover more than 
half a century, and desired Emerson's son, Dr. 
Edward Waldo Emerson, to assume the task. 
" Only take time enough," he said ; " do not al- 
low yourself to be hurried." The request was 
complied with, and, assisted by Emerson's grand- 
son, Mr. Waldo Emerson Forbes, the editor has 
now issued two volumes of generous extracts 
from the earlier journals, bringing this remark- 
able autobiography of a mind (or, rather, of a 
soul) down to the end of 1832 — the writer's 
thirtieth year. 

Emerson's old friend and schoolmate, William 
H. Furness, has written of him that he never 
played as other boys play, but that he dwelt 
apart and sought his recreation in books and 
self-communing and the sympathetic enjoyment 
of Nature. " It was as natural for this boy to 
write," says his son and editor, in introducing 
his copious journals, " as to another to play ball, 
or go fishing, or experiment with the tools of a 
neighbour carpenter, or feel out tunes on a musi- 
cal instrument." As was to have been expected, 
there is frequent self-scrutiny and some self- 
upbraiding in the young student's diary ; but 
intellectual dissipation appears to be the worst 
offense he has to charge himself with as he con- 
templates the range and variety of his reading 
and speculation. He also regretted that he 
found it so difficult to meet his fellow-men on 
a common ground of sympathy and under- 
standing. The subordinate place that a person 
of rare endowments united with somewhat 
over-delicate sensibilities commonly finds him- 
self obliged to take in general company was far 
from being the position to which he felt himself 
entitled. The following confessions, written in 

* Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson. With annota- 
tions. Edited by Edward Waldo Emerson and Waldo Emerson 
Forbes. Volume I., 1820-1824. Volume II., 1824-1832. Illus- 
trated. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



his twenty-first year, reveal the writer's noble 
discontent. 

"... I must further say that every comparison of 
myself with my mates that six or seven, perhaps sixteen 
or seventeen years have made, has convinced me that 
there exists a signal defect of character which neutralizes 
in great part the just influence my talents ought to have. 
Whether that defect be in the address, in the fault of 
good forms, — which, Queen Isabella said, were like 
perpetual letters commendatory — or deeper seated in an 
absence of common sympathies, or even in a levity of the 
understanding, I caimot tell. But its bitter fruits are a 
sore uneasiness in the company of most men and women, 
a frigid fear of offending and jealousy of disrespect, an 
inability to lead and an unwillingness to follow the cur- 
rent conversation, which contrive to make me second 
with all those among whom chiefly I wish to be first. 

" Hence my bearing in the world is the direct oppo- 
site of that good-humoured independence and self- 
esteem which should mark the gentleman. Be it here 
remembered that there is a decent pride which is con- 
spicuous in the perfect model of a Christian man. I am 
unfortunate also, as was Rienzi, in a propensity to laugh, 
or rather, snicker. I am ill at ease, therefore, among 
men. I criticize with hardness; I lavishly applaud; I 
weakly argue; and I wonder with a 'foolish face of 
praise.' " 

Intimately revealing and profoundly significant 
are such fragments of self-examination, and for 
the sores and bruises of many an aspiring and 
stumbling young reader there will be found 
in them a most soothing balm. Again, such 
passages as the following, the utterance of an 
eighteen-year-old boy, have a wonderful way of 
striking a responsive chord. The same thought 
is expressed by George Eliot in the ripeness of 
her genius, but her words are winged with a 
force and insight no greater than that com- 
manded by the youthful Emerson. 

" Never mistake yourself to be great, or designed for 
greatness, because you have been visited by an indistinct 
and shadowy hope that something is reserved for you 
beyond the common lot. It is easier to aspire than to 
do the deeds. The very idleness which leaves you leis- 
ure to dream of honour is the insurmountable obstacle 
between you and it. Those who are fitly furnished for 
the weary passage from mediocrity to greatness seldom 
find time or appetite to indulge that hungry and boister- 
ous importunity for excitement which weaker intellects 
are prone to display. That which helps them on to emi- 
nence is in itself sufficient to engross the attention of all 
their powers, and to occupy the aching void. Greatness 
never comes upon a man by surprise, and without his 
exertions or consent. No, it is another sort of Genii 
who traverse your path suddenly; it is Poverty which 
travels like an armed man; it is Contempt which meets 
you in the corners and highways with a hiss, and Anger 
which treads you down as with the Hghtning. Greatness 
is a property for which no man gets credit too soon; it 
must be possessed long before it is acknowledged." 

A year later he writes again in the same vein, 
acknowledging his strong desire to take a high 
rank " in the innumerable assembly of men," 



1909.]

but also admitting that " every young man is 
prone to be misled by the suggestions of his own 
ill-founded ambition, which he mistakes for the 
promptings of a secret Genius." The arch foe 
to the realization of greatness this indefatigable 
youth finds to be " the demon Indolence."' 

Passages utilized by Emerson in his lecture 
writing have been, as a rule, omitted in the 
editing of his journals : but it is impossible to 
turn the pages without chancing on many a 
familiar or favorite thought whose more mature 
expression is to be found in one of the essays or 
addresses. More than once the great law of 
compensation moves him to reflection. At the 
age of nineteen we find him writing in this 
strain : 

•• Thus knowledge is a good; but it must be acquired 
in different ways, and there is no single way which com- 
bines the advantages of all the others. The advantages 
which one man enjoys by access to unusual sources of 
improvement do, by some necessity, deprive him of 
admittance to other sources equally rare and rich. Is 
he opulent, and commands the privileges of hbraries 
and schools ? he wants that vigour and eagerness to use 
them which Necessity gives. Is he a traveller and borne 
by the winds to every foreign clime, and does he trans- 
act affairs amidst the famous ruins of each continent ? — 
then his taste has been uncultivated and he views them 
all with indifference. Has he wit and industry sufficient 
to grasp all knowledge ? — poverty shuts up with iron 
bars every avenue to him." 

Eight years later, with his heart vibrating to 
the iron string of self-reliance, he sets down 
some admonitions against self-distrust. " I 
have sometimes wished," he confesses, " I had 
not some acuteness or minuteness of observation 
that seemed inconsistent with dignity of char- 
acter ; but thus to wish seems to me now to be 
false to one's-self, to give up a tower in my 
castle to the enemy which was given me as a 
bulwark of defence." And thenceforth he scorns 
to imitate, scorns to be a secondary man, as he 
expresses it. 

The editor has closed the record of every 
year or two with a list of authors or books men- 
tioned or quoted in the journals of that period. 
In those early years Milton and Shakespeare 
were conspicuous favorites, with the Greek poets 
and philosophers in high esteem. In fact, the 
great thinkers of whatever age or race early 
claimed his attention. His reading was wide, 
and must have been somewhat desultory ; hence 
his confession of intellectual dissipation as his 
" cardinal vice."' The charm exerted upon him 
by so many branches of learning and literature, 
and also by the fine arts, is thus touched upon 
in a letter (copied in his journal of 1827) to 
his Aunt Mary. 



■ It seems to me lately that we have many capacities 
which we lack time and occasion to improve. If I read 
the Bride of Lammermoor, a thousand imperfect sugges- 
tions arise in my mind, to which could I give heed, I 
should be a novelist. When I chance to light on a verse 
of genuine poetry, it may be in a corner of a newspaper, 
a forcible sympathy awakens a legion of little goblins in 
the recesses of the soul, and if I had leisure to attend 
to the tine tiny rabble, I should straightway become a 
poet. In my day dreams, I so often hunger and thirst 
to be a painter, beside all the spasmodic attachment I 
indulge to each of the sciences and each province of 
letters. They all in turn play the coquette with my 
imagination, and it may be I shall die at the last a for- 
lorn bachelor jilted of them alL" 

That Emerson had not only some vague long- 
ing to be a painter, but also some skill as a 
draughtsman, is one of the pleasant revelations 
of his early journals, which are occasionally 
adorned with human heads in pen-and-ink, 
sometimes from living models, and sometimes 
probably from fancy. A few of these essays 
in art are reproduced in the published volumes, 
and though hastily executed they are by no 
means the scrawls of a wholly ungifted hand. 
The passion for poetry is evinced not only in 
quotations and allusions, but more interestingly 
in frequent bits of metrical composition from 
the writers own pen. Some of these early 
verses have been polished and preserved in the 
published " Poems," but the greater part were 
allowed to serve their purpose merely as exer- 
cises in poetic expression. These specimens of 
draughtsmanship and of versification make one 
inclined to dispute what his old schoolmate, 
already mentioned, says of him in the Cabot biog- 
raphy. *' Ralph and I used to sit together," 
writes Mr. Furness. " I can see him now, at 
his copy-book ; quite a laborious operation it 
appeared, as his tongue worked up and down 
with his pen. But then, thank Heaven ! he 
never had any talent for anything, — nothing 
but pure genius, which talents would have over- 
laid." Rather it was the genius and not any 
one of the talents that soon got the upper hand 
and gave to the world genuine Emersonian es- 
says and poems, instead of characterless por- 
traits or novels or other productions of mere 
talent. 

The high esteem in which Mary Moody 
Emerson stood with her nephew is abundantly 
proved by the care and thought bestowed upon 
his letters to her, letters which he often copies 
into his journal together with her letters to him. 
She had, as Emerson expressed it, " the fatal 
gift of penetration," and promptly made herself 
hated by many of those whom she met, because 
she could see through them at once, and prob-

ably scrupled not to make them aware of their 
transparency. The value to her nephew of her 
example and admonitions becomes increasingly 
evident as we study the letters that passed 
between them. The originality and force re- 
vealed in her epistolary style are in every way 
admirable. 

The family portraits and other illustrations 
included in these first two volumes are wisely 
chosen and of decided interest. That the later 
volumes, covering the years from 1833, when 
Emerson first visited Europe, down to the time 
of his full maturity, will contain more that is of 
literary excellence, is what may be confidently 
expected ; yet the freshness and young hope and 
eager acquisitiveness that so agreeably meet one 
in the earlier journals have a charm that must 
necessarily be wanting in the later.

The Charm oe Paris.* 



When one comes regretfully to the last page 
of Mr. E. V. Lucas's latest book, "A Wan- 
derer in Paris," an invitation to him takes form 
in one's mind : " The readers of The Dial re- 
quest the pleasure of Mr. Lucas's presence in 
New York and Chicago, for the purpose of ren- 
dering such pen-pictures as he has given us of 
Paris and London, and of the picturesque cities 
of Holland. R.S.V.P." 

Our invitation should include Mr. Walter 
Dexter, whose paintings, reproduced in color, 
add greatly to the charm of the volume. 
They have the exquisite carelessness acquired 
by infinitely careful workmanship. 

To grasp and retain the very essence of the 
charm of the places he visits, and to convey an 
intimate sense of that quality to his readers, — 
this is the difficult task Mr. Lucas accomplishes. 
His books are not for the specialist, though the 
specialist should enjoy them ; nor for the tour- 
ist's valise, though they are in a sense guide- 
books, idealized guide-books. The catholic in- 
terests of their author embrace the diverse tastes 
of a multitude of readers. Each fancies that his 
own Paris or his own London is that phase of 
which Mr. Lucas is especially the partisan. The 
only class of readers who might quarrel with 
Mr. Lucas are butchers and sewer-contractors ; 
for he insists that the tourist's partiality for visit- 

* AWandekebinParis. ByE. V.Lucas. With sixteen 
illustrations in color by Walter Dexter, and thirty-two repro- 
ductions from works of art. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



ing the abattoirs and the sewers of Paris is a joy- 
less one. But then, probably, few butchers and 
sewer-contractors read Mr. Lucas. His risk of 
unpopularity is, after all, slight. 

For the rest of us, little is wanting. Descrip- 
tions of pictures and statuary often fail to carry 
their message ; but in this book we are planted 
squarely in front of them, spectacles on nose, 
and if we don't see them the faidt is our own, 
not Mr. Lucas's. The boulevards and bridges- 
— those wonderful bridges of Paris — are not 
seen from a distance, dimly ; we cross and recros* 
them, arm in arm with our delightful guide. 
The public buildings are historic monuments, 
but they have vitality also ; we are told what 
happened in them yesterday, and what is going 
on to-day. The quays are full of delight to us, 
whether we are looking on while Charles Nodier 
slips a book into those capacious pockets, "quarto 
size," or whether we watch the gamin of to-day 
dive into the Seine. We fairly feel the thrill of 
the bargain-hunter in the shops. And as for the 
cafes, — well, one may be envious of dinners long 
since eaten ; the sinfulness of envy is confined 
to its present and future tense. 

Mr. Lucas has the gift of discrimination 
among words. Notre Dame, says he, is " to- 
ward evening, in the gloom, mysterious and a 
little sinister "; the old districts offer " alluring 
prospects of narrow streets and high and ancient 
houses ; — over all, that sense of thorough insan- 
itation which so often accompanies architectural 
charm in France and Italy and which seems to 
matter so little to Latin people." And here 
Mr. Dexter's work supplements that of Mr. 
Lucas with insight and sympathy. Alluring 
indeed are the streets in which he has set up his 
easel. His buildings are faithful because they 
are suggestive, leaving something to the reader's- 
imagination or his memory. The Parisiennes 
who cross his boulevards are dainty and viva- 
cious — and half an inch in height. 

Unpretentious, Mr. Lucas never seeks to im- 
prove the ultimate expression ; he often culls 
from Carlyle, and on occasion from others. 
Pater and Lowell present us to Monna Lisa. 
As to the Venus of Milo, Mr. Lucas speaks 
for himself : 

" You see her before you all the way along her cor- 
ridor: she stands quietly and glirmneringly beckoning 
at the very end of it, alone, before her dark red back- 
ground. Why the Venus of Milo is so radiantly satis- 
fying, so almost terribly beautiful, one cannot explain • 
but there it is. It is a cold beauty, but it is magical too; 
it dominates, controls. And with it there is peace. The 
strangest thing of all is that one never misses the arms. 
It is as though arms were a defect in a perfect woman." 



1909.] 



THE DIAL 



509 



And of the Winged Victory : 

" It is on the first landing of the Escalier Daru, at 
the end of the Galerie Denon, that one of the most 
splendid things in the world is to he found: it has 
been before us all the way along the Galerie Denon, 
that avenue of noble bronzes, the first thing that caught 
the eye. Everyone has seen photographs or models of 
this majestic and exquisite figure, but it must be studied 
here if one is to form a true estimate of the magical 
mastery of the sculptor. The Victory is headless and 
armless and much mutilated ; but that matters little. 
She stands on the prow of a trireme, and for every one 
who sees her with any imagination must for all time be 
the symbol of triumphant and splendid onset. The 
figure no doubt weighs more than a ton — and is as light 
as air. The • Meteor ' in a strong breeze with all her 
sails set does not convey a more exciting idea of com- 
manding and buoyant progress. But that comparison 
wholly omits the element of conquest — for this is 
essential Victory as well." 

As we wander through the Louvre, or in the 
streets, with Mr. Lucas, he arrests us with 
odd unexpected bits of information, recalled by 
chance encounters. We pass a group of copyists 
in one of the galleries, and he tells us that the 
authorities of the Louvre have five hundred 
unfinished copies in their hands abandoned by 
their authors so thoroughly as Dever to be in- 
quired for again. In all Parisian streets where 
signs are hung, the golden key is prominent. 
Mr. Lucas therefore invites us to reflect for a 
moment on the proportion of locksmiths to the 
population of Paris ; since their pretty symbol 
is seen everywhere. 

" The reason of their numbers is not very mysterious, 
when we recollect that practically everyone that one 
meets in this city, and certainly all the people of the 
middling and working classes, live in fiats, and all want 
keys. The streets and streets of small houses with which 
East London is covered are unknown in Paris, where 
every facade is but the mask which hides vast tenements 
packed with families. No wonder, then, that the 
serrurier is so busy. 

" Another sign which probably puzzles many English 
people is that of the stoppeur. Bellows's dictionary does 
not recognize the word. What is a stoppeur, and what 
does he stop ? I discovered the answer in the most 
practical way possible; for a Frenchman, in a crowd, 
helped me to it by pushing his lighted cigar into my 
back and burning a hole in it, right in the middle of the 
coat, where a patch would necessarily show. I was in 
despair, until the femme de chambre reassured me. It 
was nothing, she said : all that was needed was a stop- 
peur. She would take the coat herself. It seems that 
the stoppeur's craft is that of mending holes so deftly 
that you would not know there had been any. He 
ascertains the pattern by means of a magnifying glass, 
and then extracts threads from some part of the garment 
that does not show and weaves them in. I paid three 
francs, and have been looking for the injured spot ever 
since, but cannot find it. It is a modern miracle." 

Mr. Pater or Mr. Lowell would have described 



the Venus of Milo or the Winged Victory as well 
as Mr. Lucas. But would they have discovered 
the function of a stoppeur f 

Mr. Lucas, visiting the Mint, coins a word ; 
" mintners " he calls the employees. With one 
of them this pleasant conversation is reported : 

" An Englishman's perhaps indiscreet questions as to 
what precautions were taken to prevent leakage amused 
the guide beyond all reason. ' It is impossible,' he said ; 
1 the coins are weighed. They must correspond to the 
prescribed weight.' • But who,' my countryman went on, 
in the relentless English way, 'checks the weigher?' 
' Another,' said the guide. ' But a time must come,' con- 
tinued the Briton, ' when there is no one left to check — 
when the last man of all is officiating : how then ? 7 
Our guide laughed very happily, and repeated that there 
were no thieves there; and I daresay he is right. ' Per- 
haps,' I said to the English inquisitor, ' perhaps, like 
assistants in sweet-shops, they are allowed at first to 
help themselves so much that they acquire a disgust for 
money.' He looked at me with eyes of stone. I think 
he had Scotch blood. ' Perhaps,' he said at last." 

If the present reviewer has chosen to quote 
Mr. Lucas at his lightest, rather than at his 
best, the reviewer and not Mr. Lucas should be 
accused of trifling. His serious and eloquent 
periods are more frequent than his contagious- 
humor; and he often shows himself a sharp 
critic. On the whole, it may be as well for us 
if he postpones his visit to America. There are 
still Rome and Florence for his wanderings.

In Old Virginia.* 



Virginia : surely the name is one to conjure 
with. Around the name of what other State of 
the Union cling so many romantic associations ; 
so many memories of dramatic achievement ; 
such an atmosphere of chivalry and gentlemanly 
leisure — all the more seductive because so very 
far removed from the atmosphere of this twen- 
tieth century. Most of us, if the truth were 
told, would not exchange the twentieth for the 
eighteenth century ; but an occasional visit has 
all the charm of a vacation in some beautiful 
secluded valley. Therefore we owe a debt of 
gratitude to Mrs. Sale, and to her publishers, 
for the glimpses they have given us into the 
homes and lives of the men and women of the 
Ancient Commonwealth. Books such as this 
have also a more serious value. They gather 
together the rapidly- vanishing records of an age

that is gone, to be moulded some day# by the 
master mind, into a history of the period. An 
English reviewer has described those who per- 
form this useful service as the hod-carriers of 
history. The characterization is apt, though it 
sounds a little ungracious. The true historian 
is born but once in a great while ; and most of 
us must be content to toil upward with the bricks 
that he may some day call for. If the bricks 
are judged worthy, that should be a sufficient 
reward. 

As historic bricks, one can find nothing but 
praise for Mrs. Sale's records, — though it 
would be idle to anticipate the judgment of the 
master-builder. The only regret one feels is 
that she did not crowd more of them into her 
hod. It is tantalizing, for instance, to be told 
that Colonel Landon Carter, of Sabine Hall, 
was on terms of intimacy with the most dis- 
tinguished men of his time, and that his corre- 
spondence, which has been carefully preserved, 
is interwoven with the names of Washington, 
Lafayette, Lee, and Randolph, — and yet be 
given no glimpse into this most interesting cor- 
respondence. 

The author of this entertaining book writes 
with an enthusiasm which betrays her into some 
faults of style. The reader is carried along on 
a sea of superlatives that sometimes leaves him 
breathless. One may forgive " this superb old 
Commonwealth" and "this God-gifted region 
in which every loyal American proudly feels a 
personal share," but it strains one's powers of 
appreciation to be told of " a surpassingly lovely 
wooded roadway," with " exquisite glimpses of 
the river " leading to an " incomparable green- 
sward "; of a mansion that " graces superbly 
one of the choicest river sites," and of the 
" incomparable ceiling decorations " of another. 
But in spite of such defects the reader will find 
many things to repay him in the perusal of 
Mrs. Sale's book, — even though he should be 
a native of Virginia and think that he already 
knows a good deal of the history of his State. 
Nothing could be more charming than the homes 
of Virginia — except their gracious inhabitants. 
Virginian hospitality is something more than a 
tradition, and those who have not been privileged 
to enjoy it to-day may at least gather from these 
pages what it meant in the time of our grand- 
fathers. These stately halls echoed the voices 
of men and women whose names stood for all 
that was most worthy in the commonwealth. 
They were gentlemen and gentlewomen in the 
truest sense of the term. Their hospitality was 



as boundless as it was sincere ; and it was exer- 
cised in an environment that was peculiarly their 
own. These were homes indeed. 

One is helped to a keener appreciation of the 
character and quality of the manors of Colonial 
Virginia by the many well-chosen and admir- 
ably reproduced illustrations with which this 
book is equipped. For these, and for the gen- 
eral make-up of the volume, the publishers are 
deserving of much praise.

Books about Famous Men.* 



Napoleon asked his secretary, Las Cases, 
when they were starting for St. Helena, " What 
can we do in that out-of -the- world place ? " 
What he actually did do, the degree of influ- 
ence that he still exerted, from his island prison, 
on the fortunes of France, and so to some ex- 
tent of Europe, is told in sufficient detail, and 
with constant reference to published and man- 
uscript sources of information, by M. Philippe 
Gonnard in his profusely illustrated volume 
entitled " The Exile of St. Helena." But the 
purpose of the book goes further than this : what 
the author has primarily tried to do is to deter- 
mine the share Napoleon had in generating the 
so-called "Napoleonic legend," — that is, the 
legend that he was the disinterested advocate of 
the principles of 1789; that, himself a Liberal, 
he became Dictator only from sheer necessity ; 
that, wishing for peace, he was repeatedly 
forced into war by the European coalition ; that 
he supported and proclaimed the law of nations, 
and so on. This " Napoleonic legend," so at 
variance with many historic facts, the author 
thinks may be traced to its source in the writ- 
ings and reported sayings of the St. Helena exile. 
" The conclusion to which one comes after such 
a study as this," says the author in closing, " is 
that the man of St. Helena equalled the man of 
Austerlitz. He realised there the political mis-

takes he had made, and, as far as it was in his 
power, he endeavoured to make up for them." 
The argument is well handled, and the book 
may be read with profit and pleasure in connec- 
tion with Lord Rosebery's work, " Napoleon : 
the Last Phase," which the French author fre- 
quently cites. M. Gonnard's competent trans- 
lator is unnamed, but deserves at least a closing 
word of praise. 

A decadent kingdom tottering to its fall, and 
hurried over the precipice by a brilliant but irre- 
sponsible and morally worthless ruler, is the 
subject of the late R. Xisbet Bain's readable and 
scholarly volume on " The Last King of Poland, 
and his Contemporaries." It is a department 
of eastern European history made familiar to 
the author by his previous studies and writings, 
and he, better than almost any other English 
scholar, was fitted to undertake the reading and 
critical study of the numerous Polish, Russian, 
and other authorities on the deeds and misdeeds 
of Stanislaus Poniatowski. Of course it is no 
picture of puritanic virtues and austere living 
that we are called upon to contemplate ; the con- 
spicuous position that Catherine II. occupies in 
the canvas is a sufficient assurance of that. 
Among the episodes (more amusing and perhaps 
more instructive than the main events) which en- 
liven the narrative is one in which the sorrows 
of an underpaid royal librarian, Reverdil, are 
serio-comically narrated by the librarian-author. 
Insufficient shelving, no charging system, no 
classification, poor lighting, and extreme exi- 
guity of income, were among the ills afflicting 
this royal library : while its custodian was 
obliged to marry two of the King's cast-off mis- 
tresses (but not simultaneously) in order to 
retain his unenviable position. Portraits of 
Stanislaus, the " Prince Charming " of the story, 
and of celebrated contemporaries, are liberally 
supplied. 

Sir Horace Rumbold's late diplomatic experi- 
ence, as British Ambassador to the Emperor of 
Austria, has qualified him to write understand- 
ingly of that monarch and his court. " Francis 
Joseph and his Times " is the title of a beauti- 
fully printed, well illustrated, and agreeably 
written volume from Sir Horace's pen. The 
public and the private life of the Emperor are 
passed in review, his entrance on the scene being 
prepared for by five chapters of historical matter 
from the close of the eighteenth to the middle 
of the nineteenth century. In dealing with 
royalties, as with women, the natural impulse is 
to be to their virtues very kind and to their 



faults a little blind ; and this amiable impulse 
the author has indulged. But the aged ruler is 
surely a majestic figure. One wishes that Sir 
Horace might have thrown some light on the 
tragic fate of Crown Prince Rudolf, but the sad 
event of now twenty years ago is only briefly 
touched upon. The ties of politics and race 
uniting the Austrians and the Germans are 
regarded by the author as a" baneful bond," 
and he views with not unnatural English appre- 
hension a possible welding together of all central 
Europe " under the hard, unscrupulous lead of 
the most aspiring of Powers." The German 
bogy dies hard. 

" The Iron Cardinal," by Mr. Joseph MeCabe, 
modestly disclaims any pretensions to complete- 
ness as a biography, but, as indicated by its 
sub-title, " The Romance of Richelieu," contents 
itself with examining the authenticity of certain 
romantic legends that have become associated 
with Richelieu's name. In other words, this 
hero of the elder Dumas and of G. P. R. James 
is dragged with all his trappings of romance 
about him into the search-light of history ; and 
the result is the representation of a Richelieu 
rather less darkly repellant and ruthlessly ambi- 
tious than is the common conception of him. He 
has suffered, pleads the author, from two unfor- 
tunate circumstances : " He was born into an 
age of national lawlessness, and it took a gener- 
ation to destroy it "; and his deeds and char- 
acter have been made the fruitful subject of 
many memoirs from the hands of his enemies, 
while those who knew him best and were not 
prejudiced against him have left no written tri- 
bute to his memory. The complete life of this 
wonderful man remains to be written, is in fact 
even now in process of writing by the French 
historian M. Hanotaux. Meanwhile this less 
serious and far less voluminous study of his 
character, with its many portraits and other 
attractive features, is welcome. 

Petrarch's fame, as Miss Maud F. Jerrold 
remarks in the preface to her " Francesco Pe- 
trarca, Poet and Humanist," was long that of a 
poet, his claims to consideration as a humanist 
being obscured by the beauties of his lyric verse. 
The purpose of her book is to do equal justice 
to the author of those Latin studies which are 
now attracting increasing attention, and to the 
composer of the exquisite sonnets whose modern 
imitators have, by their exaggeration of Pe- 
trarch's faults of taste, thrown some shadow of 
disfavor upon their model. Accordingly, in a 
dozen narrative and critical chapters she tells

the story of his life and work, drawing freely 
for illustration on his vernacular verse and Latin 
prose, but condescending to the reader's possible 
unfamiliarity with those tongues by supplying 
translations, apparently her own in most in- 
stances. The influence of Petrarch on English 
poetry, with the old argument from the Prologue 
of the " Canterbury Tales " to demonstrate the 
probability of a personal meeting between 
Chaucer and his Italian contemporary, is treated 
in a chapter on " Petrarca's School. ' The secret 
of Petrarch's charm as a man, the author finds 
in the fact that his character shows " a total lack 
of the obvious and the consistent, and this it is, 
perhaps, which makes him so perennially inter- 
esting. There is nothing flatter in life than the 
people who are so like themselves, of whom we 
can predict what they will say and do on all occa- 
sions, and the line of conduct they are sure to 
pursue." A more careful avoidance of the tau- 
tology illustrated by the last sentence would have 
made still more excellent this scholarly treat- 
ment of an interesting theme. The appended 
bibliography, alphabetically arranged, is to be 
commended. 

One needs only to look upon the portrait of 
Corot to feel the charm of his naturalness and 
unaffected goodness. In Mr. Everard Meynell's 
" Corot and his Friends " this endearing quality 
of the man is emphasized, and the reader is 
spared the jargon of the studio and the technical 
criticism of the expert. To Robaut's voluminous 
work on Corot and to the intimate reminiscences 
of MM. Dumesnil and Silvestre the author 
acknowledges his large indebtedness. In the 
compass of three hundred openly printed pages 
he has brought together all that the desultory 
student of art history needs to know of this 
French painter, and the text is illustrated with 
a good number of half-tone prints from his 
masterpieces. These mechanical reproductions 
do but scant justice to the peculiar excellences 
of the originals, but they may at least spur on 
the reader to make the acquaintance of those 
originals. Some of Corot's attributes as artist 
and man are reflected in a friend's account of 
him : " He is simple, good, and altogether free 
from the vices of genius. He is so sweet and 
gentle that he hesitates to awake a dozing model. 
He is extremely gallant towards women, ex- 
tremely good-natured with children. . . . He 
has often said to me, ' When I find myself in 
one of Nature's beautiful places, I grow angry 
with my pictures.' Perhaps the trials of his 
youth, the long contest made against his genius, 
had left some bitterness in his spirit." 



Books about Famous Womex.* 



The lives of actors, and perhaps even more 
of actresses, are likely to be full of interesting 
and often racy adventures and experiences, and 
their biographies have always made good read- 
ing. In her copious octavo on " The Incom- 
parable Siddons " Mrs. Clement Parsons has got 
together a great amount of entertaining matter 
relating to the English stage of a century and 
more ago, the histrionically gifted Kemble 
family, and the brightly shining light of that 
family, Mrs. Sarah Kemble Siddons. To be 
sure, there are no scandals to lend their wicked 
allurement to the pages of such a life as Mrs. 
Siddons's, — and, indeed, one of her earlier biog- 
raphers, Thomas Campbell, has complained 
that from a memoir-writer's point of view his 
subject was all " piety and purity," and had, like 
the happy nation, no history. " Dear good Mrs. 
Siddons ! " he exclaimed ; " she was a very angel, 
but devils make better stuff for biography." 
Almost as much as Queen Victoria, says Mrs. 
Parsons, she evoked the plain man's respect for 
a good and great woman. The author's studies 
for her "Garrick and his Circle" have paved 
the way to this second contribution to stage 
history, and the lack of any recent and detailed 
work on her chosen subject makes her book 
timely and acceptable. The long list of works 
consulted, and the footnotes, appendices, and 
index, are evidences of thoroughness and care 
on the writer's part. Eight portraits of Mrs. 
Siddons, with other illustrations, are provided 
for the adornment of the volume. 

A literary puzzle, fascinating to not a few 
students of Carlyle, has been the guessing of the 
original of " Blumine " in " Sartor Resartus." 
Jane Welsh, Kitty Kirkpatrick, and Margaret 
Gordon have all been suggested. Some plausi- 
bly maintain that each has contributed a feature

or two to a composite '• Blumine "; but Mr. 
Raymond Clare Archibald, in his exhaustive 
researches on the subject, now published in a 
book entitled " Carlyle's First Love," throws 
out Kitty Kirkpatrick altogether, as never hav- 
ing inspired a tender sentiment in Carlyle's 
breast, and makes " Blumine " a compound of 
the other two, of whom he proceeds to set forth 
all that is known or knowable about the fair 
Margaret. In addition to printed and manu- 
script sources of information, the author has for 
several years been gathering scraps of knowl- 
edge from persons dwelling in various quarters 
of the globe ; and if we have not now the real 
Margaret Gordon before us, it is hopeless to 
expect that we ever shall have. Interesting and 
full of character she must have been to attract the 
young Kirkcaldy schoolmaster ; and her extant 
and already published letters to him further 
demonstrate her possession of uncommon attri- 
butes. A frontispiece portrait, done in colors 
from a miniature, pictures her physical charms 
at the age of twenty-five ; and other illustrations 
are inserted in the body of the book. 

For a second time within a few years, the 
pathetic fate of the young and fair and innocent 
Lady Jane Grey has been made the subject of 
careful historical study. " The Nine Days' 
Queen/' by Mr. Richard Davey, is written with 
studious regard to the philosophy of history, the 
causal connection of earlier with later events. 
It was by reason of a remarkable chain of con- 
spiracies that poor Httle Lady Jane, sorely 
against her will, found herself exalted, at six- 
teen years of age, to the perilous height of 
Queen of England — for nine days. AVhat 
these conspiracies were, and how they resulted 
in the tragedy of an innocent girl's execution, 
is duly set forth by Mr. Davey. The volume 
has two portraits of Lady Jane, strangely un- 
like each other, with portraits of contemporary 
celebrities. 

It is only necessary to look at Hayter's por- 
trait of Mrs. Norton to understand why she has 
been an object of unusual interest both to con- 
temporaries and to posterity. In " The Life of 
the Honourable Mrs. Norton," by Miss Jane 
Gray Perkins, her vehement personality is again 
presented, portrayed largely by herself in the 
many letters, some of them never before pub- 
lished. which her grandson has placed at the 
author's disposal. It is to do her the justice 
which Miss Perkins believes she has never before 
received, that this fresh narration of her wrongs 
and of her vigorous protest against them is 
added to the already existing accounts of her 



eventful life. The generous space allowed her 
to tell her own story in the form of intimate 
letters is a striking and admirable feature of the 
book. A glimpse of her also through the eyes 
of John Van Buren (son of Martin) is thus 
afforded : " She was very gracious to him and 
he admired her conversation, but her beauty was 
so unlike the fragile loveliness of his own country- 
women that he was not entirely pleased with 
' that superb lump of flesh,' as Sidney Smith 
once jokingly called her." A Ust, two pages 
long, of her novels, poems, songs, and miscel- 
lanies, is appended. Seven portraits of this 
famous granddaughter of the famous Sheridan 
are provided, to complete the reader's conception 
of her. 

Varied and sometimes uncommon have been 
the experiences on two continents of Lady St. 
Helier, as related in her " Memories of Fifty 
Years." Born in Munich, of Scotch parents, 
reared in the far North of Scotland, married 
first to the second son of Lord Stanley of 
Alderley, and after his death to Sir Francis 
Jeune (afterward Baron St. Helier), she gained 
a knowledge of the world ranging from a rough 
Nevada mining camp which she was the first 
woman to visit, to the brilliant society that fre- 
quented her drawing-rooms in Harley Street. 
She calls her delightfully readable book her 
" first literary effort," and confesses that she 
has published it "with the greatest diffidence," 
bespeaking her readers' charitable indulgence 
for what she fears is "a very rash attempt to 
provide them with a little amusement." Not- 
abilities without number are encountered in her 
pages, always making their entrance without 
flourish of trumpets, and generally adding much 
to the interest of the scene. She speaks, in pass" 
ing, of her first meeting Motley — "at my 
Aunt Louisa's (Lady Ashburton) one evening 
at dinner, and as he came into the room it 
seemed almost as if the most magnificent Van- 
dyck you could imagine had stepped out of its 
frame." A few portraits, including the author's, 
and some sketches by Mr. Harry Furniss and 
Sir Frank Lockwood, add to the interest of this 
unassuming but very attractive volume. 

Convenient length and a readable style are 
the chief merits of Mr. C. C. Dyson's " Madame 
de Maintenon." The excuse for adding one 
more to the almost countless volumes inspired 
by that remarkable woman is thus given : "For 
the benefit of those who have neither the money 
to buy nor the time to study such voluminous 
records of life at the Court of Louis the Great, 
the author, having weighed the evidence for

and against disputed points, has extracted from 
the mass of superfluous matter the leading traits 
of her character and the most interesting epi- 
sodes of her life, and put them together in a 
concise form, hoping to give a clear conception 
of Mme. de Maintenon and her career to the 
present generation, who for the most part have 
but an indistinct idea of her personality, and 
still more so of the scope of her great work St. 
Cyr." In the weighing of evidence, the scales 
tip in favor of Mme. de Maintenon, the book 
being warmly eulogistic from beginning to end. 
Frequent portraits help to sustain the interest, 
a list of twenty-six leading French authorities 
precedes the narrative, and a short index is 
appended. 



Some Recent Books of Travel.* 



A family flight by motor-car through Dalmatia, 
Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia is briskly de- 
scribed and copiously illustrated in Mrs. Frances 
Kinsley Hutchinson's " Motoring in the Balkans." 
Something of the breathless speed of the petroleum 
chariot is felt in the exhilarating style of the narra- 
tive, "which whirls the reader from Trieste down along 
the coast of the Adriatic as far as Cetinje, and then 
northward again, but further inland, to Vienna. 
The Leader, the Cautious One, the Enthusiast, the 
Gentle Lady, and Madame Content, are pleasant 
characters, and the whole journey is sufficiently 
idealized and dramatized and disencumbered of the 
commonplace to make it into a very inviting book. 
Nearly fifteen hundred miles were covered in forty- 
eight days, thirty-six towns were visited, and no end 
of fine scenery was viewed. The pictures, a hundred 
and eighteen in number, made from photographs 
taken by the author, are in an agreeable brown half- 
tone, and as they are on inserted leaves the reading

pages are free from the eye-wearying gloss that mars 
so many process-illustrated books. Mrs. Hutchinson 
is already favorably known through her earlier work, 
"Our Country Home." 

In a handsome volume entitled " Travels in 
Spain " Mr. Philip Sanford Marden tells the story 
of a springtime journey from Gibraltar, or really 
from Tangier on the African side of the strait, across 
the Spanish Peninsula and ending at Monserrat. It 
is encouraging to intending travellers to be assured 
at the outset that no rancor is harbored in the Span- 
iard's bosom against the victors in the unfortunate 
passage-at-arms of eleven years ago. The announce- 
ment that one is an American is almost always taken 
to mean South American ; but when the error is 
rectified no resentment is manifested. Mr. Marden 
believes his book will meet a felt want on the part 
of visitors to Spain; and it does possess qualities not 
found in Murray or Baedeker. In regard to the 
numerous pictures he says they are all but two of his 
own making. They were, however, made with the 
help of a camera, and therefore call for no comment 
on the illustrator's skill as an artist. To the stay- 
at-home traveller, no less than to him of more adven- 
turous mood, the book may be commended. 

The last book (or next to the last, if we may hope 
for his still unpublished Autobiography) we shall 
have from the pen of the late Jeremiah Curtin, 
learned mythologist and wonderfully gifted linguist, 
has appeared under the title, " A Journey in South- 
ern Siberia : the Mongols, their Religion and their 
Myths," issued by his regular publishers, Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. Not less interesting than the 
narrative itself is the prefatory account of the author 
from the pen of his one-time instructor in mathe- 
matics at Harvard, ex-President Eliot. Leaving the 
book to speak chiefly for itself, we are tempted to 
call attention here to one of Curtin's earliest feats in 
language-learning. Seven months and a half before 
he entered Harvard he did not know a word of Latin 
or Greek ; yet at the entrance examination he offered 
more of each than was required — as Dr. Eliot in-

forms us on the authority of the manuscript Auto- 
biography. That such a linguist (he knew more 
than sixty languages, and spoke all the tongues of 
Europe and some of those of Asia) was the right 
man to make the most of a journey among the 
Mongol tribes, is indisputable. His book is one that 
probably no other person could have produced with 
equal facility. The illustrations are many, and a 
map. with notes and two indices, is supplied. 

Described with the pen of an enthusiast, the 
••Rome" of Edward Hutton should appeal to those 
who are quick to feel the charm of any spot that is 
old in story and romance. Adorned with sixteen 
colored pictures from the brush of Mr. Maxwell 
Armfield, and with twelve uncolored half-tones, the 
volume, as published by the Macmillan Co., forms 
a handy and attractive pocket companion for the 
traveller, and also offers pleasant reading to the 
armchair tourist at his own fireside. It is no 
unsentimental journey that one makes in Mr. Hut- 
ton's company. u I feel," he declares, " the eternity 
of Rome as I feel the brief sweetness of every 
passing moment there : she seems to me as eternal 
and persistent as life, as strangely various, as mys- 
teriously secret. In her name is married domina- 
tion and love. ROMA-AMOR, which none may 
ever divide or separate." Strength rather than 
domination is etymologically suggested by the Eter- 
nal City's name ; but that matters little. The book 
is evidently the mature fruit of a long and loving 
acquaintance with that whereof it treats. 

"Round the World in a Motor-Car" (Kennerly) 
describes the eight-months tour of the globe made 
by Signor Antonio Scarfoglio and two companions, 
from Paris westward to Paris again. The author is 
a young man, apparently in the early twenties (to 
judge by the frontispiece portrait), and he writes 
with the young man's fresh interest in everything 
visible, audible, tangible, or otherwise perceptible. 
There is, too, a juvenile proneness to remarks evi- 
dently intended to show smartness, but really show- 
ing immaturity and crudeness. The publication of 
the book in this country would seem to be rendered 
somewhat superfluous by passages like this : " I do 
not like the Americans as a whole, just as I do not 
like the cheesemonger whom a prize in a lottery or a 
sudden rise in the price of potatoes has made wealthy. 
There is still too much of the herdsman about them, 
and their clothes are still permeated by the smell of 
the soil." This is much as though we should judge 
the people of Italy from the peregrinating organ- 
grinder or peanut-vender that adorn our city streets. 
The book is translated by Mr. J. Parker Heyes, and 
has seventy half-tone illustrations on inserted leaves, 
but no map and no index. 

The antique and the modern coexist, side by side, 
in the wonderful land of Mexico. The automobile, 
the electric street-car and the arc-light have come ; 
but the aboriginal Mexican with his burro, the car- 
gador with his burden, and the old-time village 
priest, have remained. •* Mexico, the Wonderland 
of the South." contains Mr. W. E. Carson's account 



of his travels from the Rio Grande on the north to 
the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the south ; there being 
no lack of strange things and persons and events to 
describe on the way. Among the things to smile 
at is a Mexican restaurant-keeper's attempt to nat- 
uralize the breakfast foods of the United States. It 
can well be imagined that some of our fearful and 
wonderful names for various cereal products strained 
the Spanish language to the breaking point. The 
promise of profit from the development of tropical 
Mexico's exceedingly fertile lands will cheer those 
readers who have invested their money in any of 
the numerous agricultural or lumber or rubber- 
producing enterprises that have already drawn 
millions of dollars to that land of amazing commer- 
cial possibilities (and some actualities). Pictures 
abound in the book, and it is in every way as divert- 
ing as such a narrative could well be. 

Miss Agnes Deans Cameron, who frankly de- 
scribes herself as a school-teacher of twenty-five 
years' experience, has varied the rigors of the 
schoolroom with a summer's jaunt across British 
America, from Winnipeg (the journey really began 
at Chicago) to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. 
"The New North" is the name she gives to her 
account of the expedition. It was an arduous under- 
taking for a woman, but her full-length portrait 
shows her to be no weakling, and the vigorous style 
of her narrative is further proof of her abundant 
vitality. She is a loyal Canadian and delights to 
sing the praises of her native land ; but in claiming 
for Winnipeg a " phenomenal growth " unequalled 
by any city on the continent in the last thirty-three 
years, she goes a little too far. Our great West and 
Northwest can show even more surprising examples 
of rapid growth — Seattle, for instance. Through- 
out her travels, Miss Cameron used her camera to 
as good purpose as her eyes ; and she has adorned 
her book with more than two hundred interesting 
views and portraits. Though heavy to the hand, 
the volume is by no means heavy reading. 

Dr. Wilfred T. Grenf ell, ever busy with head and 
hands in improving the condition of his chosen people 
of chilly Labrador, has collaborated with eleven other 
interested investigators and students in the prepara- 
tion of a substantial volume entitled ;t Labrador : the 
Country and the People." The burden of the work 
has, almost inevitably, been shouldered by Dr. Gren- 
f ell ; while chapters on the history, geology, fauna, 
flora, and other belongings or characteristics of the 
country, have been contributed by Mr. W.S.Wallace, 
Dr. Reginald A. Daly, Mr. Charles W. Johnson, Mr. 
Outram Bangs, Miss Mary J. Rathbun, and others. 
The missionary-doctor's faith in the rich future of 
this sub-arctic region is fairly touching. " Surely 
it will come to pass," he confidently affirms, " that 
one day another Atlantic City will rise amidst these 
unexplored but invigorating wilds to lure men and 
women tired of heat and exhausted by the nerve stress 
of overcrowded centres." Perhaps so ; but not, we 
fancy, until the terrible mosquito of the short and 
fierce Canadian summer has been exterminated. The

book has, among other merits, that of dealing with 
a subject not yet written to death by earlier authors. 
The numerous pictures are an important feature of 
the work. 

Mr. Norman Duncan and Mr. Lawren Harris 
journeyed together from Jerusalem down into 
Egypt, pursuing much the same route as that fol- 
lowed by Joseph in Bible days; and they have put 
their noteworthy experiences into book form, Mr. 
Duncan supplying the narrative and his companion 
the illustrations. " Going Down from Jerusalem " 
succeeds in surrounding itself with the right atmos- 
phere without tiring the reader with landscape 
descriptions. The modest compass of the volume 
is mostly filled with the human element, and many 
types of the desert and the vineyard and the silent 
hills are skilfully presented. Among these the 
" desert detective " is not the least interesting. It 
is indeed a marvellous thing, as the author says, 
that a man should be able to tell whence a camel or 
a wanderer comes — whether from city or moun- 
tain, sandy desert, or hard-bottomed waste — by the 
mere imprint of his feet. Even further than that, 
we are assured that he can determine, from this 
footprint, the weight of a camel's load, the tribe to 
which a man belongs, the manner of his passing, 
whether by stealth or openly, and much more be- 
sides. The many quaint conversations and anec- 
dotes recorded make the book diverting, and the 
pictures contribute much in the way of " local color," 
though executed in black and white. 

The people and the places of old Brittany have 
been visited, partly by automobile, incongruous 
though that may appear, by Mrs. Frances M. 
Gostling, who records her pleasant outing in "The 
Bretons at Home." By following her itinerary she 
feels assured that travellers will gain a better knowl- 
edge of the Province than by spending their time at 
the ordinary tourist resorts, which have ceased to be 
distinctively Breton. A seven-page introduction in 
French by M. Anatole Le Braz commends the book 
to the reader's confidence, and numerous pictures, in 
color and in half-tone, stimulate the interest. It is 
surely a quaint country, unspoiled by modernity, 
where the natives still repair to the graveyard and 
seek the silent companionship of the dead when they 
wish to have a comfortable smoke, to make love, or 
to gossip. The unhackneyed and the unartificial are 
found in Mrs. Gostling's pages. 

The curiosities, antiquities, legends, ruins, natu- 
ral beauties, and other attractions of Northumber- 
land have received sympathetic and rather detailed 
treatment at the hands of Mr. A. G. Bradley in a 
compactly printed octavo entitled " The Romance 
of Northumberland." The first chapter is physio- 
graphical and historical, the last is devoted to an 
account of the battle of Flodden Field, and the 
fourteen intermediate ones take up the chief points 
of interest, one after another. A map precedes, an 
index follows, and sixteen colored and twelve uncol- 
ored illustrations are interspersed. The brightness 
of the colored pictures hardly accords with pre- 



conceptions of the grayness, approaching sombreness, 
of the too-often fog-enveloped regions described ; 
but doubtless even Northumberland has its summer 
days of serenity. As a guide book or travel narra- 
tive of the intensive sort, the work bears evidence 
of diligence and care and minute research. 

An odd whim prompted Mr. Henry Festing Jones 
to dedicated his little book of "Diversions in Sicily" 
to a certain unborn Enrico Pampalone, to whom he 
is to stand godfather as soon as the birth is an ac- 
complished fact. The whimsical dedication, which 
covers three pages, is followed by other things 
whimsical or otherwise diverting in the nineteen 
short chapters of the book. A good deal about 
marionette theatres and the plays there presented is 
entertainingly chronicled, and many Sicilian oddities 
of other sorts are also encountered. Although the 
writer speaks of his sketching in the course of his 
wanderings, he has furnished no specimen of his 
artistic skill, the book being innocent of pictorial 
embellishment. The recent cataclysm and other 
horrors in Sicily are light-heartedly ignored ; in fact, 
a part of the volume appears to have been written 
before iEtna's late outburst, and is here republished 
after appearance elsewhere. 

The hunting parson is more common in England 
than in this country ; but we have at least one Nim- 
rod of the Church, and a lion-hunter at that. The 
Rev. Dr. W. S. Rainsford, the well-known former 
rector of St. George's, in New York, recently spent 
thirteen months in East Africa, hunting big game, 
and his book, " The Land of the Lion," describes in 
detail, and with many pictures from photographs, 
the things he did and saw and heard about in that 
huntsman's paradise. Keen on the scent for game 
though Dr. Rainsford is, it is not the mere butchery 
that engrosses him. Among the divers excursory 
speculations and reflections that the book contains is 
a little homily on the degeneration of the rhinoceros 
under the too-easy conditions of his modern life — 
" surely," concludes the preacher-hunter, " a striking 
illustration, in the animal world, of that universal 
truth we are so prone to forget : that easy times do 
not always make for real usefulness or greatness." 
The literature of African hunting, already abundant, 
is increasing in these days ; but a more variously in- 
teresting book for the stay-at-home general reader 
than Dr. Rainsford's will not soon make its 
appearance. 

The reviewer seldom has an easier or a pleasanter 
task than that of unfolding the merits of Miss Anne 
Macdonnell's " In the Abruzzi " ; for he need do 
little besides quoting a few words from the text, 
and recommending that the twelve illustrations after 
water-color drawings by Miss Amy Atkinson be 
seen. The land is " strange, uncouth, primitive, 
little distant from Rome in mileage, incalculably 
distant in everything else " — especially in having 
no present-day art. " Italy, an Italian sky, an 
Italian climate — for summer here on the heights is 
divine — and no art ! Can the honest Briton at 
his honestest conceive of anything more delightful ? "

But u the picturesque is everywhere, and to an ex- 
travagant degree." After relieving the traveller's 
mind by assuring him that the mountains are much 
saf er than London, since brigandage has ceased and 
there are only occasional wolves, and informing him 
of religion, folk-lore, and ancient art, Miss Mac- 
donnell conducts him from one beautiful spot to 
another, each with its own '' flaunting defiance of the 
ordinary," and many of them unknown because " the 
guide-books dare not star anything so inconveniently 
placed." The people from whom sprang Ovid, 
Michetti, the Rosettis, and d'Annunzio (who " has 
maladies of the spirit which his people have not "), 
are u an old race, and by no means simple. They 
have long and unquiet memories ; and out of the 
past there are survivals and dreams that to-day does 
not readily understand." The volume is a thick 
octavo, modestly bound, and interesting from begin- 
ning to end. 

In the form of newspaper letters, and afterward 
in the shape of a book, Mr. Franklin Matthews has 
already told the story of the Atlantic Fleet's cruise 
from Hampton Roads to San Francisco. The 
account of the remainder of the voyage, from San 
Francisco westward to the original starting-point, has 
now been republished from the New York " Sun," 
with added matter, in a companion volume entitled 
" Back to Hampton Roads." Forty-six thousand 
knots, or nearly twice the circumference of the earth, 
were steamed by the participating war-ships, and 
enough important points were visited to furnish the 
accompanying journalist with material for varied 
and interesting letters home. Life on shipboard, 
too, is made to appear not at all monotonous by the 
resourceful pen of Mr. Matthews. His style in this 
volume is as brisk and jaunty as in its predecessor. 
The book, with its occasional pictures, is all that one 
could ask for in its sort.

Illustrated Editions of Standard Literature. 
Two additions are made this year to the Shake- 
spearian dramas that may be had in beautifully 
illustrated quarto volumes. The latest plays to be 
given pictorial settings are " The Merchant of 
Venice " and " As You Like It," both published, in 
daintily bound large print volumes, by Messrs. 
Hodder & Stoughton. For "The Merchant of 
Venice," Sir James D. Linton has made nearly forty 
pictures. They are richly colored ; costuming and 
accessories are carefully studied ; and as decoration, 
or as suggestions for staging the play, they are very 
successful. As interpretations of the spirit of the 
comedy, they fail; for they are lacking in poetic 
imagination. Mr. Hugh Thomson's delightful pic- 
tures, — daintily colored, elusive in suggestion, 
playful, full of romantic imagination as well as of 
humor, — are all that Sir James Linton's are not, and 
not all that his are. The stage manager would find 



them too slight and simple to be of practical value. 
Indeed, they have nothing to do with a matter so 
artificial as the stage. Pretty Rosalind asleep on a 
bank with woodland elves peering at her beauty ; 
Rosalind with Celia and Touchstone wearily leaning 
against a sturdy Arden oak ; Phebe imploring Rosa- 
lind to love her, while the neglected sheep stare 
stupidly from the nearest hill-side, — no scenes like 
these were ever played outside the magic bounds of 
Arden and men's minds. It is natural to compare 
Mr. Thomson's work in color with Dulac's and 
Rackham's. We miss in it the Oriental richness of 
coloring and detail that characterizes the one, and 
the wonderful densely peopled fairy world that the 
other evokes ; but upon turning back to " As You 
Like It " we perceive a certain suggestiveness and 
lightness of touch, veiled humor and subtlety, which, 
if perhaps not so compelling as the qualities of the 
younger artists, are very charming, and mark this 
volume as a distinct achievement for its illustrator, 
and as one of the choicest gift books of the year. 

A new " Rackham book " has come to be an 
annual event of exceptional interest. This year Mr. 
Arthur Rackham has several illustrated volumes to 
his credit, but all except one are new adaptations 
of old work. The completely new work is to 
be found in a reprint of De la Motte Fouque"'s 
"Undine" (Doubleday, Page & Co.), the text 
adapted from the German by Mr. W. L. Courtney, 
with fifteen full-page pictures in color and many 
decorative bits in black-and-white by Mr. Rackham. 
The M fearsome forest " by the fisherman's cottage, 
and the " crystal vault " of waters to which Undine 
ever returned, the weird beauty of Undine herself, 
and her strange adventures with the knight Huld- 
brand, afford Mr. Rackham exactly the right motives. 
He strikes no new note, and he offers less material, in 
bulk, than usual ; which means that the " Undine " 
is slighter but no less charming than the other 
Rackham books. 

Robert Browning's "Dramatis Personse" and 
" Dramatic Romances and Lyrics " have been illus- 
trated in color by Miss Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale, 
and are published by Messrs. J. B. Lippincott Co. 
in a companion volume to "Pippa Passes" and "Men 
and Women," also illustrated by Miss Brickdale. 
The text generally follows that of the first editions ; 
but the first version of " Saul " is omitted, since that 
poem is included in full in the other volume. The 
illustrations, which are beautifully reproduced, just 
as the text is beautifully printed, emphasize the 
pictorial and sensuous elements of Browning's poetry, 
rather than its deeper significance. The binding is of 
gray buckram, with gold lettering and decorations. 

As "The Water-Babies" is certainly a fairy tale 
for children of all ages, it would indeed be bad logic 
to consider Macmillan's new quarto edition with illus- 
trations in color by Mr. Warwick Goble as exclu- 
sively or chiefly a book for the very young. Mr. 
Goble's style is more like Thomson's than Dulac's 
or Rackham's, — quaint, simple, suggestive, occa- 
sionally a little crude in its attempt to be expressive

without effort. On the whole, it is very well suited 
to depicting water babies, good fairies, " great fish," 
the caves of the sea, and other matters discussed by 
Charles Kingsley. The text is in large, clear print, 
and the plates are separately mounted on tinted 
sheets. 

"Friendship Framed in Flowers," the Misses 
Cowles might have called the reprint of Cicero's 
" De Amicitia " and Emerson's essay on Friendship, 
for which they have decorated the margins, if 
they had chosen to be both explicit and alliterative ; 
but they use only the modest title " Friendship," and 
allow the reader to learn for himself what they have 
added. The editors have provided for each left-hand 
page a quotation on Friendship, from someone who 
had a good saying about it — though they have missed 
some of the best. But in this case the decorations 
are the book. Each page is framed in a flower 
border, one of pansies, the next of ragged robins, the 
next of anemones, etc. They are the perfection of 
conventionalized naturalness, some on gold with line 
borders, some without background. (Putnam.) 

George Eliot's poem of " Two Lovers " is issued 
in holiday dress by Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co., 
with illustrations in color by Mr. Howard Chandler 
Christy. Poet and illustrator do not, at first thought, 
seem happily matched ; but as " Two Lovers " is not 
particularly characteristic of George Eliot, the choice 
of artist becomes more or less an arbitrary matter. 
Mr. Christy's pictures are in his familiar style of 
showing pretty well-dressed women admired by 
handsome well-groomed men. 

Of additions to well-known gift-book series, we 
have the usual quota. There are three new " Chis- 
wick Calendars " (T. Y. Crowell & Co.), described 
more accurately as year-books, with daily quota- 
tions from some classic writer, and a portrait fron- 
tispiece in photogravure by way of ornament. The 
"Thoreau Calendar" is edited by Mrs. Annie 
Russell Marble, the " "Wordsworth Calendar " by 
A. E. Sims, and the " Stevenson Calendar " by Miss 
Florence L. Tucker. — Messrs. Duffield & Co. offer 
in their pretty " Rubric Series " Emerson's " Na- 
ture," Browning's " Pippa Passes," and " Dickens's 
" Christmas Carol." — The new volume in Messrs. 
H. M. Caldwell Co.'s " Great Galleries of Europe " 
is devoted to the Wallace collection. It consists, 
like the rest of the series, of about sixty half-tone 
plates, each accompanied by a few lines of descrip- 
tion. — The Sesame Booklets " boast a long list of 
additional volumes : " Great Thoughts from Rus- 
kin," " Wayside Thoughts from Shakespeare," 
" The King of the Golden River," « Goblin Mar- 
ket," " Gabriel Gent," " Christmas at Dingley Dell," 
"Bardell vs. Pickwick," "The Pied Piper," "The 
Nut-Brown Maid," and " Little Essays Abbreviated 
from Bacon." Each of the tiny volumes contains an 
appropriate frontispiece, and several are fully illus- 
trated. — From the Oxford University Press come 
four volumes in the " Oxford Moment Series." One 
is bound in vellum, one in flowered silk, one in 
plain limp leather, and one in leather embossed with 



a graceful design ; and all may be had in any of the 
four styles thus illustrated. Each has a colored por- 
trait frontispiece and colored end-papers. In this 
dainty form are presented " The Rubalydt of Omar 
Khayyam," " Moments with Dickens," " Moments 
with George Eliot," and " Moments with Robert 
Browning." 

Illustrated Art Books. 

The three volumes in prettily flowered cloth 
binding which are dedicated to the " Modes and 
Manners of the Nineteenth Century " (Dutton), and 
are translated with revisions by M. Edwardes, from 
the text of Dr. Oscar Fischel and Max V. Boehm, 
bring forward the awesome subject of clothes in a 
way not to be ignored. The paradox of ugly gar- 
ments shown in lovely prints is constantly achieved 
by these plates from English, French, and German 
predecessors of " Godey 's Lady's Book." The folly of 
fashions could not have more charming exposition. 
Besides numerous color prints, there are hundreds 
of half-tones, some of them from the paintings of 
David, Ingres, or Goya. The text is not to be 
ignored, either, with its comments, often incisive, 
on history, politics, art, and religion, from 1780 to 
1870. But all subjects, as the Sartor himself has 
told us, lead to clothes ; and the way is pointed by 
slight but daring signs of philosophy. "We knew 
that the Empire costume was the natural outgrowth 
of the teaching of Rousseau ; but had we considered 
that the infinitude of flounces which followed was 
" the fitting accompaniment for the medley of 
chivalry, romance, "Weltschmerz, medievalism, mes- 
merism, and God knows what else, which in 1830 
were all in turn the chief subjects of interest"? 
This sartorial philosophy is not pessimistic, for after 
seeing how much worse the hats of 1810 were than 
those of to-day the reader is encouraged to hope 
that the world is growing more sensible — even 
though slowly. He might like to suggest that where 
the mass of material is so great, an index for both 
illustrations and text would be an improvement, did 
he not perhaps feel that these volumes, like some of 
the women pictured in them, are too pretty to find 
fault with. 

One of the notable art volumes of the year, com- 
bining in unusual degree beauty of illustration with 
brilliancy of authorship, is Mr. Haldane Macfall's 
"The French Pastellists " (Macmillan), edited by 
Mr. T. Leman Hare. The book is quarto size, so 
that the beautifully colored illustrations, which are 
all separately mounted, are large enough to produce 
their full effect. They are fifty-two in number, more 
than half of them exhibiting the work of the master 
in pastels, La Tour. Rosalba, Boucher, Chardin, 
Perronneau, Boze, and le Brun are among the other 
artists represented. If the plates whet one's appe- 
tite for information, the quality of the text gives it 
yet a keener edge. Mr. Macfall writes of the lives 
of the pastellists, the times that moulded their work 
and gave it vogue, characterizes their art and esti- 
mates their significance. His phrasing is epigram- 
matic, suggestive, at times studied to the point of 



1909.]

affectation, but always significant. He has caught 
characteristic anecdotes, names characteristic quali- 
ties, pictures vividly the charm of the age and the 
men of whom he writes. His work is much too 
profound and scholarly to be summed up in any 
brief notice such as this, which can only aim at super- 
ficial description for the guidance of holiday buyers. 
Some of these will remember with pleasure the 
•• Eighteenth Century French Prints " of last year, 
to which the new study is intended as a companion 
volume. 

Part of the satisfaction derived from such a sump- 
tuous folio as Mr. Francis Lenygon's " The Decora- 
tions and Furniture of English Mansions during the 
XVII. and XVIII. Centuries " (Scribner) is that we 
ourselves need not live under such masses of mag- 
nificence. Still, most of us have enough love of 
splendor — atavistic, perhaps — to enjoy seeing the 
pictured presentment of the elaborately worked ceil- 
ings and stairways of Inigo Jones and Sir Christo- 
pher "Wren, the impossibly heavy and ornate tables 
and chairs of William Kent, the chimney-pieces of 
Grinling Gibbons, with their *' fruitages, herbages, 
gumms. beasts, fowls, etc., exceeding natural all 
round," and even the screens and paintings in 
'* Chinese style " for which the wealthy used to spend 
their substance. These striking objects are here set 
before us in full-page photographs tastefully mounted 
on gray paper, or in page after page of admirable 
half-tones. The text imparts no small knowledge of 
the decorative work of the great architects whose 
genius for these lesser things is often overlooked, and 
also of the manufacture of tapestries, carpets, lacquer, 
mirrors, and other accessories. Many of the things 
are very beautiful, especially the walls in natural 
wood ; but many of them would be much more beauti- 
ful if they were more simple. 

History. 
St. Paul's Cathedral, like its neighbor "Westminster 
Abbey, has furnished materials for many books ; 
and it has been supposed that Dean Milman's 
u Annals " would have precluded any attempt at 
another comprehensive history of the great cathedral. 
But the Rev. William McDonald Sinclair, D.D., 
Archdeacon of London, Canon of St Paul's, and 
Honorary Chaplain to the King, finds a raison d'etre 
for his " Memorials of St. Paul's Cathedral " 
(Jacobs) in the fact that Milman's u Annals " were 
published in 1868, and since that year many changes 
have taken place in the great cathedral, and many 
reforms have been instituted in the religious life 
which centres therein ; so that the " Annals " can no 
longer be accepted as an accurate description of the 
St. Paul's that now is. Many of the reforms were 
due to the energy of the present Dean, Doctor 
Gregory, for whom the author has great veneration, 
expressed not only in the dedication of the book to 
him, but in many ways throughout the volume. For 
the early history of the cathedral the author has 
drawn chiefly upon Milman's u Annals," but with- 
out neglecting other valuable books on St. Paul's 



and its famous architect. For the later period, 
embracing the last half-century, he has been priv- 
ileged to have access to the diaries of the late Robert 
Green, Dean's Verger, extending over forty-eight 
years of service at St. Paul's. Three chapters of 
the book are devoted to extracts from these diaries, 
with additions and explanatory notes by the author. 
The book is both a history and a guide-book, and 
contains many valuable biographical notes of the 
Bishops of London, Deans, organists, and others 
associated with the life of the great Cathedral. The 
numerous illustrations, by Louis Weirter, include 
ground-plans of St. Paul's so arranged as to com- 
pare its size with St Peter's, Rome, and with the old 
St. Paul's ; and various details of Sir Christopher 
Wren's masterpiece of architecture. 

The substantial look of Mr. H. B. Wheatley's 
"Hogarth's London" (Dutton), with its sensible 
binding, will remind many of us of our first sets of 
Dickens and Thackeray ; and not inappropriately, 
since Hogarth did for London with his engravings 
what the novelists did later with their stories. Mr. 
Wheatley has not attempted to supersede in any way 
Mr. Austin Dobson's authoritative work on Hogarth, 
but has only elaborated a sub-topic. In the thirty 
years since he first considered the subject, he has 
learned much of the life of eighteenth-century Lon- 
don in mansion and tavern, church and court-room, 
theatre and hospital ; and he divides what he has to 
say, apropos of the pictures, under these heads. The 
pictures given in the very excellent reproductions 
are wisely selected, partly from well-known engrav- 
ings and paintings, and partly from rare ones. The 
interpretations are in many cases quoted from Ire- 
land's " Hogarth Illustrated." Mr. Wheatley does 
not despise the absorbing question, " Who was this 
meant for?" but traces many of the caricatures to 
their originals, often with great detail of time and 
circumstance. But after all the detail the reality 
which haunts the reader when he closes the book is 
not that of London, but of Hogarth himself, the 
••unrelenting, uncompromising, uncompassionate " 
moralist who showed London to itself in " one of the 
worst-mannered periods of our history." The vein 
of tenderness in the artist, which has been too little 
emphasized by commentators, is brought out by his 
pictures of the " Shrimp Girl " and of his own six 
servants. 

The France, or rather the Paris, of a bygone age 
is capable of reconstruction out of the innumerable 
memoirs and diaries of contemporary French cele- 
brities, more readily and more accurately than the 
same sort of rehabilitation can be effected for almost 
any other country or capital of either hemisphere. 
'• The Days of the Directoire," compiled from many 
and trustworthy sources of information, with occa- 
sional calls upon secondary authorities of less un- 
doubted reliability, is the product of the diligent pen 
of Mr. Alfred Allinson, and is published in a sub- 
stantial octavo by the John Lane Co. Among the 
half-hundred illustrations occur some curious costume 
plates, selected by Mr. John Colby Abbott. A para

graph, chosen at random, affords a glimpse of Paris 
life under conditions so difficult for us now to realize. 
" The theatres," we read, " were in full swing. 
Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that 
a certain number of houses had never closed their 
doors, not even in the worst days of the Terror, and 
now, in safer circumstances and under more favour- 
able conditions, a score or so were giving regular or 
occasional performances. Never had the play been 
more popular, or audiences more numerous and 
enthusiastic." 

Wit and Humor. 

The bead necessarily escapes somewhat from wit 
pressed into a book, but Mr. William Harvey has at 
least preserved a good Hibernian flavor in his " Irish 
Life and Humour" (Lippincott). The life is not 
described except by Mr. Erskine Nicol's paintings, 
which are reproduced in full color, and show a dozen 
or more of the sons of Erin and one or two of the 
daughters making themselves happy in various char- 
acteristic ways. These homely mobile faces supply 
the impression of actuality needed in a five-hundred- 
page recital of jokes. Not but that the stories are 
good, for they are ; they will even satisfy the person 
who u thinks they will be better than he expects." 
Mr. Harvey does well not to over-introduce them, 
and not to pad them, but to give them " straight," 
with only such explanation as is necessary to their 
understanding. The jokes and stories are not all 
new, and most of them are from books ; but who 
could make a representative collection of which this 
would not be true ? It is enough that they are well 
told, diverting, and convincingly true to life. 

Among the humorous booklets of the season, one 
of the wittiest is ''The New Golfer's Almanac for 
the Year 1910 '' (Houghton), compiled by Mr. W. L. 
Stoddard and sympathetically illustrated by Mr. 
A. W. Bartlett. The aim of the book is to do for the 
golfer ("a large and necessary class") what the 
" Farmer's Almanac " does for the agriculturist, viz.: 
to present him with a grist of useful information, 
and entertaining and instructive reading, assembled, 
in this instance, from the choicest prose and poetry 
to be found in golfing literature. — " Fore ! The Call 
of the Links " (H. M. Caldwell Co.) is a collection 
of humorous verse about golfers and some other 
people, by Mr. W. Hastings Webling. Mr. Webling 
compares golf to life in that " it produces inspiration, 
and inspiration begets poetry." There are many 
illustrations in tint. — Another "large and necessary 
class " is provided for by Mr. Arnold Haultain, who 
once wrote about golf, and now writes " Hints for 
Lovers " ( Houghton), a collection of wise, witty, 
cynical, and suggestive sayings about girls, men, 
women, love, and love-making, beauty, kisses, en- 
gagements, marriage, and other allied subjects. A 
charming pink-and-silver binding is, happily, the 
only decoration. — " Foolish Questions " (Small, 
Maynard & Co.), by Mr. R. Goldberg, is a book for 
everybody who has ever been asked a foolish ques- 
tion. It may also be consulted with profit and 
pleasure by those who have the foolish question 



habit. It suggests many apt and conclusive answers 
to the queries of the " Bromides " whose idea of 
startling conversation is the Inquiry Obvious ; and 
there are illustrations which further elucidate the 
subject. — Mr. Harry Graham's " Deportmental 
Ditties" (Duffield & Co.) explain, in flowing verse, 
the correct and remunerative behavior for every sit- 
uation in life. Whether one is choosing a profession, 
making or receiving a proposal, dancing, is at sea 
or at table, Mr. Graham has entertaining sugges- 
tions to offer. — Mother Goose parodies on the 
humors of bridge, bridge rules in rhyme, limericks 
exploiting the bridge fiend, the novice, the bad loser, 
and other familiar types, make up Miss Mabel Allen 
Avery's "Mother Goose on Bridge " (Syracuse, N.Y., 
Lyman Brothers). For the confirmed bridge 
player, provided he has also a sense of humor, no 
better gift could be devised. — " The Thin Santa 
Claus : The Christmas Yard that was a Christmas- 
Stocking " is the inviting if somewhat cryptic title 
of Mr. Ellis Parker Butler's latest story. A re- 
minder that Mr. Butler is the author of " Pigs is 
Pigs " and " That Pup " will perhaps stand in lieu 
of any further account of his latest effort. — " Wags " 
(A. Wessels), by Mr. Morgan Shepard, is further 
described on the title-page as " The Philosophy of 
a Peaceful Pup." The Pup is optimistic as well as 
peaceful, and his theories of life will cheer and 
amuse all " under-dogs " who read them ; and who 
is not sometimes in the position of "under-dog"? — 
" Lays of a Lazy Dog " (Luce & Co. ) are " interpre- 
ted " by Mr. D. K. Stevens and illustrated by Miss 
Katherine Maynadier Browne. The " Lazy Dog " 
is a pampered Boston bull ; not so pampered, how- 
ever, that he has not had many interesting expe- 
riences. — " A Night Out " (Moffat), by Mr. Edward 
Peple, is the tale of a Persian cat, also pampered, 
who spent one " night out " in plebeian company, 
and came back "the morning after" damaged but 
happy. — Parents and other relatives of brilliant 
children will enjoy the late Rear Admiral Preble's 
collection of children's bright remarks, called " Did 
Your Child Say This?" (John W. Luce & Co.). 
Occasional blank pages headed " What Did Your 
Child Say ? " gives aforesaid parents and relatives 
an opportunity to make choice additions to the 
printed collection. — Finally, " The Airship Alma- 
nac, a Little Light Literature on High Life " tells 
with vivid illustrations, how to get off the earth 
and how to get on again, including much excellent 
advice on how and when to fall, complete list of 
official hospitals of the Agro Club, etc. The author 
is Mr. Lewis Allen, " Master of Starts, Doctor of 
Gravity." (John W. Luce & Co.) 

Holiday Fiction. 
The elaborately wrought cover, and the richly- 
colored prints from paintings by Mr. Howard Pyle, 
draw immediate attention to Mr. James Branch 
Cabell's collection of romances which appears under 
the rather inadequate title "Chivalry" (Harper). 
These ten stories are said to be adapted from " The 



1909.] 



THE DIAJL 



521 



Dizain of Queens, of that noble maker in the French 
tongue, Messire Nicolas de Caen," dedicated to 
Isabella of Portugal in 1470. Inasmuch as indexes 
of Romance literature know no such person, Mr. 
Cabell is likely to receive credit for inventing both 
stories and author ; but that is probably the more 
credit, since it is well done. The stories have to 
do with kings and queens of England, and tell how 
Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III., repented 
her of her bloody deeds when a loyal knight gave 
his life for her ; how Edward I. tempestuously 
wooed Elinor of Castile ; how even Isabelle the 
Cruel, wife of Edward II., had enough of chivalry 
in her heart to forgive the lover who abandoned 
her ; how Henry V. met Katherine of France " all 
in a garden fair," and won her love before history 
spied upon them ; and how many other brave events 
came about. There are tense and tragic situations 
in plenty, and each brings out some heroic sacrifice. 
The tales are told with a fervor which, however 
much it may have characterized the people of the 
time, has not crept into the manner of their chroni- 
cles. But partly for this reason the tales will be 
accepted as breathing the very spirit of " the bleak, 
florid age." The troubadour's part is justly repre- 
sented by many flowing, ardent songs. 

A romance of a few days of Shakespeare's life, 
written by Louise Beecher Chancellor and called 
" The Players of London," brings " the dark lady " 
to life in rather a pretty and ingenious way. Shake- 
speare has written " Romeo and Juliet " for the Lord 
Chamberlain's Company to play before the Queen, 
but at the last moment Philip Condell, on whose 
beauty and grace in the part of Juliet the success of 
the drama depends, is desperately ill. Resolved not 
to fail, Shakespeare and Burbage carry their Juliet 
to Whitehall, where by accident Shakespeare dis- 
covers that the slender actor is not Philip but his 
sister PhyUis. He keeps the secret, and Phyllis 
carries off the play better than her brother could 
have done. But Shakespeare, and later Southamp- 
ton, fall in love with Phyllis, and from the resulting 
complication the imaginary heroine emerges with 
rather more dignity than either of her lovers. If 
the reader is willing that this should be so, he will 
like the story ; if not, he will at least grow wise from 
the careful study of historic background, and will 
gather a possible explanation of some of the sonnets. 
The book is a large octavo, bound in violet cloth, the 
shade of which is repeated in Mr. Harry B. Mathews's 
page decorations. (B. W. Dodge & Co.) 

Compilations, Calendars, and Year Books. 

A compilation, by Mary Minerva Barrows, of 
prose and verse quotations on "The Value of Happi- 
ness " ( H. M. Caldwell Co.) shows a commendably 
catholic taste. A person ought to get a full view of 
the subject when he has before him the sentiments 
of the wise, from St. Angustine to Amiel, and from 
Epictetus to Whittier. No classification has been 
made, with the interesting result that one finds, for 
example, Lydia M. Child, John Fiske, Carlyle, and 



Horace, on the same page. On the whole, the ex- 
tracts lean to the safe and serious, — the name of 
Bernard Shaw and even of Dr. Holmes being notice- 
ably absent. The critic might venture the thought 
that such a compilation would be more valuable if 
the proportion of famous names were greater, and 
those not known or little known were fewer; but 
that would prove that he had not reached that mea- 
sure of contentment which the book is well fitted to 
give. Such contentment, however, is sure to come 
to him from the tinted decorations which enclose 
the text. 

In Mr. Lionel Strachey's selection of " Love 
Letters of Famous Royalties and Commanders " 
(John McBride Co.) the little god of the bow and 
arrows takes up the harp of life and smites on all 
the chords with considerable force. Noticeable is 
the exceeding softness of the stern warrior in suing 
for the favor of his mistress. Marlborough, Nelson, 
Gustavus Adolphus, Moltke, all surrender uncon- 
ditionally to the tender passion. Among the 
" royalties," Henry the Eighth of England, Charles 
the First and Charles the Second, Henry of Navarre, 
and others, are represented by letters — not invari- 
ably to their present or prospective wives. The 
necessary introductory matter to the twenty-one 
series of letters has been supplied by Mr. Walter 
Littlefield. 

Mr. Peter Newell has this fall centred his efforts 
in behalf of the gaiety of nations upon the " Peter 
Newell Calendar" (Harper). Each month has a 
verse and a picture, into which is deftly introduced 
the necessary calendar, the excuse for all this admir- 
able fooling. — Serious-minded readers will like Mr. 
John T. McFarland's calendar " A Year with the 
Master." There is a sheet, printed in two colors, 
for each week of the year, giving the Sunday-school 
lesson, daily Bible readings, and an extract chosen 
from Dr. McFarland's book "Etchings of the 
Master." — " The Farm Calendar " has twelve tinted 
sheets, each with a landscape appropriate to the 
month, and a verse, expressive of farm atmosphere, 
by Mr. John Russell Hayes. (Philadelphia, Pa.: 
Biddle Press.) 

"The Calendar of the Fellowship for 1910" 
(Boston : Bacon & Brown), compiled by Miss Harriet 
Mason Kilburn, is a year-book with a page for notes 
for each week and a corresponding page of selected 
quotations. Miss Kilburn has worked upon the 
theory that the spirit of fellowship is the dominating 
note of the time ; and the quotations that interpret 
this spirit have been drawn from the writers of all 
ages, with a series from Morris's " Dream of John 
Ball " as a thread of connection among them. 

" The Sense and Sentiment of Thackeray " (Har- 
per) has been culled by Mrs. Charles Mason 
Fairbanks from the novels and correspondence. 
Thackeray, as Mrs. Fairbanks notes in her intro- 
duction, has not been generally considered a quota- 
ble writer ; but she finds ample material to fill a 
pocket volume, which is bound in red limp leather, 
with a portrait frontispiece.

[Dec. 16, 



A new anthology for the man who smokes has 
heen arranged hy Mr. Joseph Knight, and is pub- 
lished in a small volume with photogravure frontis- 
piece by Messrs. H. M. Caldwell Co. It is entitled 
"A Smoker's Reveries," and contains verses new 
and old, including many written especially for this 
volume. 

Miscellaneous Holiday Books. 

Hunters who care for the history of their sport 
and have not already possessed themselves of the 
Messrs. Baillie-Grobman's folio edition of " The 
Master of Game " will grow both wise and happy 
over the attractive smaller edition which the same 
editors have prepared of this work (Duffield & Co.). 
This is the oldest English book on hunting ; for the 
original manuscript was written in 1387, and though 
it was by Gaston de Foix and in French, it was 
translated twenty years afterward, with additions, 
by Edward, second Duke of York, in the leisure of 
his imprisonment for unamiable designs on Henry 
IV. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt supplies the foreword 
to this reprint. The prologue argues that through 
the virtues of their sport hunters escape the seven 
deadly sins, and develope " great gentleness and 
nobleness of heart." The editors have shown wis- 
dom in their modification of Chaucerian English ; 
for the text is intelligible, and still spicy with strange 
words. Although many of the points about boar, 
fox, otter, etc., have not been dreamed of in the 
natural philosophy of Agassiz, — for instance, that 
" harts sing in their language " and have " a bone 
within the heart which hath great medicine," — there 
are a few modernly accurate characterizations, such 
as this : " If any beast hath the devil's spirit in him, 
without doubt it is the cat, both the wild and the 
tame." The remaining pages of the two hundred 
are taken up with directions for " finding the hare," 
" moving the hart," making the assembly " that men 
call gathering," and training hounds and mastiffs. 
An elaborate appendix supplies information for 
both antiquarian and hunter. The twenty-four fas- 
cinating illustrations in black-and-white are taken 
from the illuminations of a French manuscript of 
the fifteenth century, which is one of the treasures 
of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. 

The holiday gift-seeker in search of unique and 
out-of-the-way volumes may find what he wants in 
" Angelus Silesius," a selection from the rhymes of 
the seventeenth century German mystic, translated 
in the original metres by Dr. Paul Cams (Open 
Court Publishing Co.). An interesting preface 
introduces the reader to Johannes Scheffler, better 
known as Angelus Silesius. The original version 
of the rhymes is given with the translations. A 
quaint frontispiece reproduced from the first edition, 
rubricated rulings on every page, and an artistic 
cover, together with handy size, are the embellish- 
ments of the volume. From the same publishers, 
in equally attractive form, comes another odd vol- 
ume, " Edward's Dream : The Philosophy of a 
Humorist," translated from the German of Wilhelm 



Busch and edited by Dr. Paul Carus. Readers of 
" Fliegenden Blatter " may be familiar with Busch's 
comic verses and drawings. Even such will enjoy 
Dr. Carus's account of Busch, his discussion of the 
significance of humor, and his " appreciation " of 
Busch's light yet meaningful solution of some of 
the problems of life and philosophy. 

Several books of recipes in attractive form suggest 
themselves as suitable gifts for the perplexed house- 
wife, always searching for some new and attractive 
dish. " ' Dame Curtsey's ' Book of Recipes " (A. C. 
McClurg & Co.) is, like the rest of the same popular 
series, at once practical and comprehensive. There 
are recipes galore, both standard and novel, together 
with much other practical information, supplemented 
by a generous supply of pertinent and attractive illus- 
trations. Handy size and odd binding are the book's 
additional recommendations to those in search of a 
gift.—" The Up-to-date Sandwich Book" (McClurg), 
compiled by Miss Eva Greene Fuller, suggests won- 
derful possibilities for varying luncheon and after- 
noon tea menus, for Miss Fuller has discovered four 
hundred different ways of making a sandwich. The 
recipes are attractively printed on tinted paper, with 
borders in color ; and the cover, gay in hues, is 
adorned by a Parisian young person with a huge 
picnic basket on her arm. — Miss Helen S. Wright 
has turned her attention to reviving a lost art. 
" Old-Time Recipes for Home-Made Wines, Cor- 
dials, and Liqueurs " (Dana Estes & Co.) tells how 
to make awonderful variety ofdelicious old-fashioned 
beverages from tried and treasured formulas. Mar- 
ginal drawings in color and a decorated cover bring 
this book also into the category of gift volumes. 

Mrs. Fanny Purdy Palmer's little volume of 
sonnets (Paul Elder & Co.) is artistically printed 
on hand-made paper, with especially designed 
initials. There are two groups of verses, " Sonnets 
of California " and " Post Meridian," each contain- 
ing fourteen numbers. — A new edition of Mrs. 
Agness Greene Foster's "You and Some Others," 
from the same publishers, contains a number of new 
poems, and all the verses have been rearranged 
under appropriate headings. The decorations of 
Mr. Will Jenkins, and the special typography and 
paper of the first edition, have been retained. 

Another of Wagner's music-dramas, " The Val- 
kyrie," has been retold by Dr. Oliver Huckel in 
blank verse, — a, narrative paraphrase of the drama's 
action, dialogue, and setting that avoids the rawness 
of the usual libretto and at the same time conveys 
more information. Rubricated headings, frontis- 
piece, and decorated binding are the holiday fea- 
tures. (T. Y. Crowell & Co.) 

" Dame Curtsey's Book of Etiquette " (McClurg), 
by Miss Ellye Howell Glover, is attractively bound 
in uniformity with the same versatile lady's sug- 
gestions for " Novel Entertainments " and " Guessing 
Contests." It gives all the latest decrees of Dame 
Fashion by calls, cards, invitations, parties of all 
sorts, and many allied subjects, simply told and 
conveniently arranged for reference.

Some four years ago the Chappie Publishing Co. 
began to collect the favorite songs of the American 
people. " Heart Songs," a five hundred page vol- 
ume, is the result. It contains hymns, rag-time 
tunes, operatic selections, college songs, love-songs, 
sea-songs, lullabies, — in short, songs of all conceiv- 
able kinds, arranged, apparently, in a hit-or-miss 
fashion, to emphasize their wide variety. As some 
twenty-five thousand suggestions were considered in 
compiling the volume, it may fairly be supposed 
to contain at least a few of every one's favorite 
melodies. 

Miss Marguerite Merington, through whose good 
offices " Cranford " has been delightfully drama- 
tized, has now made " The Vicar of Wakefield " 
into a play. A cover with a vignetted picture in 
color of the heroine, and a colored frontispiece, give 
the book a holiday air. (Duffield & Co.) 

An illustrated edition of some of Ben King's fav- 
orite verses is issued by Messrs. Forbes & Co., with 
colored illustrations, floral page-borders, and a gay 
cover. The collection is entitled '• Jane Jones and 
Some Others," and contains all of Mr. King's best- 
known poems. 

Unique among the small books of religious inter- 
est is Miss Eveline Warner Brainerd's compilation 
of " Great Hymns of the Middle Ages," issued 
by the Century Co. in their •' Thumb-nail Series " 
of miniature volumes. The hymns are arranged 
chronologically from the fourth to the seventeenth 
century, with an introduction discussing their origin 
and authorship. The leather cover is stamped with 
an appropriate design, suggesting Fra Angelico's 
angels. — Dr. J. R. Miller's annual volume of sermons 
is this year entitled " The Gate Beautiful " (T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. ). It includes some twenty addresses, 
among them u The Call to Praise," " Guarding Our 
Thoughts." and " What God Thinks of Us." — " Go 
Forward " is the title of a booklet by the same 
author, attractively printed and bound, and illus- 
trated in color (T. Y. Crowell & Co.). — Special 
paper and typography, and an artistically simple 
cover distinguish Miss Edna S. Little's arrangement 
of « The Works of Jesus " (Paul Elder & Co.). The 
Bible narrative of his acts of healing and other mira- 
cles has been chronologically arranged, and is fol- 
lowed by the Sermon on the Mount Christ's own 
summary of his teachings. The Da Vinci head of 
Christ, beautifully reproduced in tint, serves as 
frontispiece. — '* Lead, Kindly Light," by Mr. John 
Sheridan Zelie, is a series of short sermons, or 
•• intimations " from Cardinal Newman's hymn, sug- 
gestive phrases from the poetry serving as chapter 
titles (Dodd, Mead & Co.)— "The Christmas 
Child " (T. Y. Crowell & Co.) is a short story of 
life on a lonely farm in Wales, written by Miss 
Hesba Stretton. There are several illustrations and 
colored page borders. — Dr. Charles E. Jefferson, 
of the Broadway Tabernacle, has written a sermon 
on Christmas giving, which he calls B Christmas 
Builders," and Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have 
published it as a Christmas gift^book, its cover gay 



with holly. — To their daintily bound " What is 
Worth While Series" Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 
have this year added four titles : " What They Did 
with Themselves," by Mr. Ernest Hamlin Abbott; 
•• Until the Evening," by Mr. Arthur C. Benson ; 
" Homespun Religion," by Dr. Elmer Ellsworth 
Higley ; and " Why Grow Old ? " by Mr. Orison 
Swett Marden. — " What Does Christmas Really 
Mean ? " a sermon begun by Mr. John T. McCutcheon 
in a cartoon, and completed by the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd 
Jones, was privately printed last winter, and was so 
well appreciated that it is now reissued in tasteful 
and inexpensive form by Messrs. Forbes & Co. 



Notes. 



" The Book of the Sweet Pea," by Mr. D. B. Crane, 
is published by Mr. John Lane in his series of " Hand- 
books of Practical Gardening." 

A popular edition in a single volume of Mr. A. Henry 
Savage Landor's " In the Forbidden Land " (first pub- 
lished twelve years ago) is now issued by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. 

" Shakespeare's Plutarch," edited by Mr. C. F. 
Tucker Brooke, is an important addition, in two vol- 
umes, to the library of "The Shakespeare Classics," 
published by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 

Mr. Robert H. Schauffler has compiled, and Messrs. 
Moffat, Yard & Co. have published, an " Arbor Day " 
book for schools, containing a great variety of selected 
passages for reading, from many writers of verse and 
prose. 

" A Text-Book of the History of Architecture," by 
Professor A. D. F. Hamlin, is now republished in an 
eighth edition by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The 
revisions incorporated into this new text are few and of 
minor importance. 

The " First Folio " Shakespeare, edited by the Misses 
Porter and Clarke, is enlarged by the publication of 
three new volumes — " Titus Andronicus," " Tymon of 
Athens," and " Anthonie and Cleopatra." Messrs. 
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. are the publishers. 

Two new volumes in the series called " Masters of 
Literature," devoted respectively to Defoe and Carlyle, 
are published by Messrs. George Bell & Sons. The 
former is edited by Mr. John Masefield, the latter by 
Mr. A. W. Evans. Shorter works complete, and lengthy 
extracts from the more bulky books, make up the con- 
tents of these volumes. 

" Light " (Columbia University Press), by President 
Richard C. Maclaurin, gives the substance of a course 
of lectures delivered a year ago at the American 
Museum of Natural History upon the Jessup Founda- 
tion. They are popular in their mode of presentation 
and at the same time abreast of the latest developments 
in the science of optics. 

The John Mc Bride Co. publish a condensed and 
modernized version of "Bradford's History of the 
Plymouth Settlement," edited by Mrs. Valerian Paget. 
Aii introduction gives the history of this " the most 
precious manuscript on earth," as Senator Hoar called 
it, preceding the statement of fact by a rhetorical flour- 
ish that is not particularly profitable. We have grave 
doubts concerning the advisability of such a modified

text as this, but it will prove its excuse for being if it 
really attracts a company of new readers to this 
foundation-document of American history. 

Mr. W. Dawson Johnston, Librarian of Columbia 
University, is preparing for the United States Bureau 
of Education a report on Special Collections in Libraries 
in the United States. It is planned to make the publi- 
cation a record of all special collections in public lib- 
raries which are of extraordinary value either because 
of their completeness or because of the rarity of their 
contents. 

In " Harper's Library of Living Thought " we have 
the following new volumes: " Christianity and the New 
Idealism," by Professor Eucken; "Revelation and In- 
spiration," by Dr. Reinhold Seeberg, and " Paul and 
Jesus," by Professor Johannes Weiss. This " Library " 
seems to be running mainly to theological discussion, 
although literature and science have not been altogether 
neglected. 

Three exceptionally interesting reprints of English 
literature are now published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 
One is a reproduction of the 1768 edition of Gray's 
poems, with a few later pieces. Another is an exact 
reprint of the Keats of 1820, including "Lamia," 
" Isabella," " Hyperion," the great " Odes," and other 
poems. The third is " Peacock's Memoirs of Shelley 
with Shelley's Letters to Peacock," now edited by Mr. 
H. F. B. Brett-Smith. 

Adolph Growoll, long and favorably known for his 
bibliographical and historical work, and for many years 
past the managing editor of the " Publishers' Weekly " 
in New York, died in that city on the seventh of this 
month, aged fifty-nine years. He was the author of 
" The Booksellers' Library and How to Use it," " The 
Profession of Bookselling," " American Book Clubs," 
" Booktrade Bibliography in the United States," and a 
number of other useful works. 

A "mature treatment of history combined with 
simplicity of language and diction " is offered in Pro- 
fessor V. A. Renouf 's " Outlines of General History " 
(Macmillan) as edited, with a few changes of minor 
importance, for American students by Professor William 
Starr Myers. The work has maps and illustrations, and 
provides, by differences of type, for a shorter and a 
longer course. Originally prepared for Chinese schools, 
the book seems well fitted for general use. 

General A. W. Greeley's " Handbook of Polar Dis- 
coveries," first published about fifteen years ago, now 
reappears in a fourth (revised) edition. The author's 
comment upon the subject just now of lively interest is 
as follows: "Phenomenal as was the success of Cook, 
and unsurpassed as were the final marches of Peary, 
the writer from his personal knowledge of the Smith 
Sound environment, and of both explorers, finds himself 
constrained to give full credit to their reports, though 
Cook's are bitterly contested." Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. publish this work. 

We have frequently commented upon the amazing 
industry of Dr. Paul Carus, in his capacity as a writer 
of philosophical books and editor of two philosophical 
periodicals. His industry is impressed upon us anew 
by the little book called "Philosophy as a Science," 
which has just been issued by him through the Open 
Court Publishing Co. This volume, after an introduc- 
tion in which the author sets forth the leading ideas of 
the monistic doctrine which he represents, gives us brief 
summaries of all his published writings, which amount 



to no less than 48 books and 959 editorial articles. All 
of these writings are carefully indexed, which makes it 
possible to find out readily just what Dr. Carus thinks 
about any given subject, and his ideas are apt to be both 
well-considered and weighty. The introductory essay 
is to be particularly commended, because it gives suc- 
cinctly what has been said over-diffusely in many thou- 
sands of pages. 

Three-quarters of a century is a long time, in our 
rapidly shifting American cities, for a business house to 
remain in one location; yet this is the period during 
which Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have had their 
quarters at 254 Washington street, Boston, from whence 
they have lately " gone up higher " — to Beacon Hill, 
with its fine flavor of aristocracy and its genuine Boston 
east winds. The old Cabot mansion, at the corner of 
Beacon and Joy streets, now handsomely and commo- 
diously houses this historic publishing company, which, 
as the successor to the firm of Hilliard, Gray & Co., 
and as the more recent purchaser of the business and 
literary property of Roberts Brothers, has enjoyed an 
increasingly prosperous existence of a century and a 
quarter, being in fact lineally descended from the first 
publishing house established in Boston. More than 
twelve hundred titles are to be counted in the general 
catalogue of the firm, and many a name illustrious in 
our literature graces its pages. We hope the house will 
long continue to prosper and to uphold the best tradi- 
tions of the. American publishing trade.
