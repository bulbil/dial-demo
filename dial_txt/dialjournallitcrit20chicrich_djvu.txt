A PLEA FOR SANITY. 

Matthew Arnold, in one of his recently pub- 
lished letters, contrasted the work which he had 
been trying to do for England with that which 
Renan had sought to do for France. To stimu- 
late the ethical sense of his fellow-countrymen 
was the task to which the great Frenchman 
applied himself, conscious of the fact that intel- 
ligence had outrun morality as an element of 
the national life. Arnold felt that his own 
peculiar task was the obverse of this, since the 
masses of the English people were not so much 
lacking in moral sense as they were deficient 
in the higher sort of intelligence connoted by 
the terms " sweetness and light " of which the 
English critic made so much. Or, to recall 
those other terms about which the finely cul- 
tured mind of the Englishman took delight in 
playing, the English spirit suffered from a 
preponderance of Hebraism over Hellenism. 
This criticism had all the more force for com- 
ing from a thinker whose insistence upon the 
ethical side of life was unfailing, and who 
allotted to conduct, as the weightiest of all hu- 
man concerns, no less than three-fourths of the 
sum total of ideal human effort. 

We suppose that many a thoughtful Amer- 
ican has asked himself which of the two influ- 
ences the moral or the intellectual was the 
more needed in his own country. A prima 
facie judgment would be likely to pronounce 
for the latter, in view of the fact that we are 
primarily an English people, sharing with our 
kinsmen over-sea the common store of English 
sympathies, ideals, and social traditions. But 
upon reflection there comes to mind some 
thought of that added drop of nervous fluid by 
which Colonel Higginson assures us that we 
are differentiated from the parent stock, some 
thought of the alien elements that have been 
injected into our social organism and as yet 
imperfectly assimilated, some thought of the 
national temper that has resulted from our iso- 
lation, our complex history, our unexampled 
material prosperity, and our frank acceptance 
of the great democratic experiment with all 
that it implies. And when we take all these 
things into account, viewing them in the light 
of recent political happenings, of the present 
state of public opinion revealed by press, pul- 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



pit, and platform, of the conclusions reached 
here and there by the philosophical observers 
who look for something deeper than surface 
indications, we are constrained to admit that 
while intellectually all is far from well with us 
as a people, it is still upon the moral side that 
we are most in need of wise counsels and a 
quickening discipline. We need both a Renan 
and an Arnold to spur us to a realization of 
our faults ; but, of the two, we are in the more 
need of a Renan. 

To all serious Americans, whose patriotism 
is too deep an emotion to find expression in 
bluster, to whom the sacred name of country 
how our language needs such a word as 
patrie ! means little unless it stands for so- 
briety, and true dignity, and a passion for jus- 
tice, in a word, for virtue in the highest signifi- 
cance of that term, the political occurrences of 
the last two weeks must have been inexpressibly 
disheartening. That so monstrous a thing as 
a war with England about the disputed boun- 
dary line of a South American state should 
even have been hinted at by irresponsible pol- 
iticians and journalists was sufficiently discour- 
aging ; that it should have received the sanc- 
tion implied by the recent message of the 
President and its reception by the national 
Legislature, and that the popular response to 
these official acts should have been what it has 
been, is saddening in a degree for which it is 
difficult to find adequate words. Above all, the 
new attitude so suddenly assumed by the Presi- 
dent is cause for profound sorrow. That the 
man whose public career has so often won the 
admiration of the judicious should have become 
the aggressive leader of the reckless and the 
unthinking, that the man who has stood so 
steadfastly for the higher morality of political 
action should have ranged himself among the 
advocates of the lower morality of opportunism, 
that the man whom we have loved most for the 
enemies he has made, whom we thought could 
be trusted to stand like a rock in the defence 
of a nobler Americanism than is dreamed of 
in the blatant philosophy of the demagogue, 
that this man of all men should place himself 
shoulder to shoulder with the Lodges and the 
Chandlers and the Morgans, and join with them 
in the insensate jingoism which is their chief 
political stock in trade, is a shock from which 
the sober-minded will not soon recover. The 
verdict of history will, we trust, deal kindly 
with President Cleveland on account of the 
downright manliness with which he has so fre- 
quently put the politicians to shame; but it 



cannot condone this act of concession to the 
men who have brought our country into such 
disrepute, and once more pointed the famous 
Johnsonian definition of the patriot. Were 
there a new Whittier among us, he would be 
justified in writing a new " Ichabod "; were a 
new Lowell to arise, he might fairly employ the 
quaint phraseology of " Hosea Biglow " to sat- 
irize the bellicose spirit that has just received 
so new and unfortunate an impulse. 

The field of THE DIAL is not that of political 
discussion (except incidentally, in reviewing 
books upon political subjects), and we leave to 
authorities upon constitutional history and in- 
ternational law the easy task of showing that 
the Monroe Doctrine is not a part of the law 
of nations, and that the Cleveland Doctrine is 
not the Monroe Doctrine. But we feel it our 
duty, as an organ of serious thought, to protest 
against the spirit of recklessness that has taken 
possession of the public mind in dealing with 
these grave matters, against the false concep- 
tion of national dignity that seems generally 
prevalent, against the popular intolerance ac- 
corded by the American Demos to any expres- 
sion of opinion not in agreement with its pre- 
judices of the moment. We appeal to the 
intellectual sanity and sober second-thought of 
our readers to aid in stemming the tide of mis- 
apprehension concerning our national rights 
and duties in relation to other countries. We 
urge upon every clear-headed observer, upon 
every student of political science, whether lay 
or professional, to express himself with no un- 
certain utterance upon this vastly-important 
subject. Every university professor, every 
member of the literary fraternity, every news- 
paper not abandoned to sensationalism, every 
preacher who can get away from his theology, 
every influential citizen of every community, 
should exert his influence in a way that, even 
though immediate danger be past, will aid in 
correcting public sentiment and in preventing 
the recurrence of a popular furor so opposed 
to the peace and dignity of our country and to 
the welfare of the world. It is easier, doubt- 
less, to swim with the current of the emotional 
politics of the hour, or to stand aloof with a 
cynical disregard of the vagaries of popular 
sentiment ; but neither attitude is worthy of the 
high-minded American, and neither is possible 
to one having a full consciousness of what it 
means to be a citizen of the Republic whose 
mission is more deeply significant for the future 
hopes of mankind than that of any other nation 
known to history.

THE DIAL 



THE BRITISH AUTHORS' APPEAL. 

On the day before Christmas there was printed 
in the London papers an address from British au- 
thors to their American brethren, pleading for a 
union of effort in behalf of peace between the two 
countries. The appeal was signed, it is stated, by 
thirteen hundred names including those of Sir 
Walter Besant, Hon. John Morley, Mr. John Rus- 
kin, Sir Edwin Arnold, Mr. George Meredith, Prof. 
W. E. H. Lecky, Sir Wrn. M. Conway, Mr. R. D. 
Blackmore, Mr. William Black, Mr. Alfred Austin, 
Mr. Hall Caine, and Mr. Rider Haggard. Only 
portions of the address have as yet reached this 
country ; these are as follows : 

"At this crisis in the history of the Anglo-Saxon 
race, there are two paths. One leads we know not 
whither, but in the end through war, with all its accom- 
paniments of carnage, unspeakable suffering, and hid- 
eous desolation, to the inevitable sequel of hatred, bit- 
terness, and disruption of our race. It is this path we 
ask you to join us in an effort to make impossible. Not 
on the grounds of political equity do we address you, 
but we are united to you by many ties. We are proud 
of the United States. There is nothing in our history 
that has earned us more glory than the conquest of the 
vast American continent by the Anglo - Saxon race. 
When our pride is humbled by a report of something 
that you do better than ourselves, it is also uplifted by 
the consciousness that you are our kith and kin. 

" There is no anti- American feeling among English- 
men. It is impossible there can be any anti-English 
feeling among Americans. For two such nations to 
take up arms would be civil war, not differing from 
your calamitous struggle of thirty years ago, except that 
the cause would be immeasurably less humane, less 
tragic, and less inevitable. 

" If war should occur between England and Amer- 
ica, English literature would be dishonored and disfig- 
ured for a century to come. Patriotic songs, histories of 
victory and defeat, records of humiliation and disgrace, 
stories of burning wrongs and unavenged insult these 
would be branded deep in the hearts of our people. 
They would so express themselves, in poems, novels, 
and plays, as to make it impossible for any of us who 
live through the fratricidal war to take up again the for- 
mer love and friendship for the united Anglo-Saxon race 
that owns the great names of Cromwell, Washington, 
Nelson, Gordon, Grant, Shakespeare, and Milton. There 
is for this race such a future as no other race has had 
in the history of the world; a future that will be built 
on the confederation of sovereign States living in the 
strength of the same liberty. 

" We appeal to all writers in the United States to 
exercise their far-reaching influence to save our litera- 
ture from dishonor and our race from lasting injury." 

The address in full will be awaited with much 
interest in this country. The reaction in public 
sentiment has probably rendered unnecessary any 
formal response, though there is little doubt as to 
what the spirit of that response would be. Nor can 
this manly and brotherly appeal fail of being a 
great influence for good in any future emergency 
threatening the peaceful relations of the two coun- 
tries. 



BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORLD'S CONGRESS 
PUBLICATIONS. 



Ever since the close of the World's Congress season, 
inquiries have been received from different parts of the 
world for definite information concerning the publica- 
tions which have been or will be made of the proceed- 
ings of the World's Congresses held at Chicago under 
the auspices of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the 
World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 ; and such in- 
quiries still continue. While no general and complete 
publication of the proceedings of the Congresses has 
yet been obtained, many special publications relating to 
particular Congresses have been issued in various quar- 
ters, but no full list of such publications has hitherto 
appeared. I have therefore thought it well to prepare 
and send to THE DIAL a brief Bibliography of the 
World's Congress Publications which have thus far come 
to my knowledge, believing that such an account would 
be of much interest, not only to the nearly six thousand 
active participants in the Congresses, but also to the 
much larger number of those who attended the sessions 
or were otherwise concerned in the proceedings. These 
publications have been issued so quietly and separately 
that very few persons can have obtained any adequate 
idea of their number and extent. In addition, thou- 
sands of articles have appeared in the public press, from 
which volumes might be compiled, showing that by com- 
mon consent the World's Congresses of 1893 were the 
crowning achievement of what Prof. Max Miiller calls 
"the mighty Columbian Exposition." 

For convenience of reference and inquiry, the several 
publications are classified in the departments of the 
Congresses to which they respectively belong, and the 
entries are arranged not in chronological order but in 
the alphabetical order of the various departments, and 
are consecutively numbered.

the World's Congress Programmes, prepared and printed 
for the several Congresses, make a volume of 1002 oc- 
tavo pages. Most of these Preliminary Publications- 
and Programmes are now out of print. 

These special publications relating to the various Con- 
gresses have tended rather to increase than to satisfy 
the demand for a general and complete publication of 
the proceedings. Those who took part in a Congress 
in one of the departments naturally have a desire to 
know what was accomplished in the other Congresses, 
not only of their own department, but also of the whole 
great series which opened on May 15 and closed on 
October 28 of the Columbian year. 

For the most part, the publications which have thus, 
far appeared represent the self-sacrificing zeal of inter- 
ested societies. In many cases, the editions are limited 
to the needs of the members, leaving none to supply the 
general public. In some cases, as the list shows, the 
publications are not in suitable form for international 
use. Hence, while enough has been done to secure the 
historic perpetuity of the immense work accomplished 
in the World's Congresses of 1893, the need still re- 
mains for an appropriate Governmental edition of the 
proceedings of the various Congresses for distribution 
among the governments, colleges, universities, and lead- 
ing public libraries of the countries which participated 
in the World's Columbian Exposition. This is required 
alike by the general welfare of the American people 
and the just obligations of international courtesy.

THE LAW AND LOGIC OF RECON- 
STRUCTION.* 

In the preface to his work on " Reconstruc- 
tion during the Civil War," Mr. Scott informs 
his readers that he intends to write the polit- 
ical history of the period of Reconstruction, and 
that the present work is merely preliminary to 
that undertaking. It will be found an exceed- 
ingly suggestive and stimulating contribution to 
the study of American politics. In dealing with 
the colonies prior to the Revolution, the author 
shows how constantly they kept in view the 
idea of their absolute separateness and equal- 
ity, and with what tenacity they clung to the 
principle of local self-government. These ideas 
continued to dominate them during the period 
of the Stamp Act and that which followed, 
covering the Congresses of 1774 and 1775. 
Prior to 1776, the idea of a union of the col- 
onies found no favor whatever ; and when the 
course of the mother country finally compelled 
them to consider the question of their common 
defense, the policy of surrendering their sep- 
arateness and sovereignty in any degree to the 
necessity of union was accepted with manifest 
hesitation and reluctance. Mr. Scott shows the 
strength and persistency of this feeling in deal- 
ing with the Articles of Confederation, the 
Ordinance of 1787, the formation of the Con- 
stitution, and the Virginia and Kentucky Reso- 
lutions of 1798-9 ; and it now seems an acci- 
dent that the Constitution was ever ratified. 
When adopted, it was everywhere understood 
to be a compact ; and this word was not intro- 
duced by Calhoun at a later period, as asserted 
by Mr. Webster, but, like the term " confed- 
eracy," was a part of the current speech of the 
time. " One cannot read the writings of the 
days which followed the adoption of the Con- 
stitution," says Mr. Scott, " and fail to see that 
secession from the Union, or rather the with- 
drawal and resumption of the states, of the 
delegated powers, was the remedy in contem- 
plation of the generation which made the Con- 
stitution ; that it was regarded as the logical 
and natural remedy, and as the only remedy." 
If the Constitution had been construed by the 
people as the creation of an indissoluble union, 
its ratification would have been impossible ; and 
it is not surprising that from the beginning of

the government to the year 1861 threats of Dis- 
union, sometimes in the North and sometimes 
in the South, were not unfrequently heard, and 
that at no time during this period was the pub- 
lic mind free from apprehension on the subject. 
In dealing with the relation of the states to 
the general government, Mr. Scott devotes sev- 
eral chapters to the formation of parties and 
the strife between the Federalists and Repub- 
licans which resulted in the triumph of Jeffer- 
son. These chapters are particularly instruct- 
ive and interesting : but the growth of the idea 
of union kept pace with that of state sover- 
eignty. This is shown in his discussion of the 
Missouri Compromise of 1820, and in the great 
speech of Webster in reply to Hayne in 1830, 
which voiced the growing sentiment of union 
and gave it a fresh impulse by his masterly and 
eloquent presentation of the subject. In his 
inaugural address of 1861, anticipating the tri- 
umph of our arms, Mr. Lincoln declared that 
" no state, upon its own mere motion, can law- 
fully get out of the union ; that resolves and 
ordinances to that effect are legally void ; and 
that acts of violence, within any state or states, 
against the authority of the United States, are 
insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to 
circumstances." Mr. Scott quotes these words, 
and the resolution of July 22, 1861, that " this 
war is not waged in any spirit of oppression, or 
for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or 
purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the 
rights or established institutions of those states, 
but to defend and maintain the supremacy of 
the Constitution, and to preserve the union with 
all the dignity, equality, and rights of the sev- 
eral states unimpaired ; and that as soon as 
these objects are accomplished the war ought 
to cease." The Emancipation Proclamation of 
January 1, 1863, showed the irresistible march 
of events, and how completely the President 
yielded to the popular demand respecting the 
abolition of slavery. On the 8th of December 
following he issued his proclamation of amnesty, 
providing a plan of reconstruction by which 
any seceded state might be restored to its place 
in the Union through the action of one-tenth of 
its voters, as shown by the presidential election 
of 1860. This became known as the presiden- 
tial plan of reconstruction, which Mr. Lincoln 
never relinquished, and which was afterwards 
followed by President Johnson. Mr. Scott 
gives an admii-able sketch of the debates on this 
plan : on the bill that followed, which passed 
both Houses and embodied the congressional 
plan of reconstruction; and on the refusal of 



12 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



the President to sign the bill, and the vigorous 
and incisive protest of Senator Wade and 
Henry Winter Davis against his action. These 
debates are now matters of history ; but they 
awakened among the people at the time the 
most profound interest and solicitude, because 
they were understood to involve the vital issues 
of the war. That wide differences of opinion 
prevailed on the question of reconstruction was 
by no means surprising. It was a new ques- 
tion. Such a blending of the principle of local 
self-government and national union as was em- 
bodied in the Constitution of the United States 
had never been known. When its complicated 
mechanism was suddenly disrupted by an un- 
expected catastrophe, the minds of men were 
necessarily bewildered in dealing with the work 
of its restoration. It seemed as difficult as had 
been its formation, and a precedent for action 
was alike wanting in either case. But the ques- 
tion had to be met, and it demanded a solution 
in the midst of a terrific struggle involving the 
life of the nation. 

Three distinct plans of reconstruction were 
submitted to Congress, the first of which was 
inaugurated by Lincoln and championed by 
him with zeal and pertinacity while he lived. 
Mr. Scott correctly says of it : 

" It could not have had its origin in any provision of 
the Constitution, for a new government was to be im- 
posed upon the state and not created by the people of 
the state; it was not therefore a popular government: 
it was to be created, ostensibly, by a small fraction of 
the people, one-tenth; it could not therefore be a gov- 
ernment of the majority, nor a republican form of gov- 
ernment: and it was to be inaugurated and indefinitely 
controlled by the army, and therefore was in violation 
of the Constitutional principle which subordinates the 
military to the civil power." 

The next plan of reconstruction was sup- 
ported by those members of the Republican 
party in Congress who maintained that the 
states were in the Union in spite of secession, 
but that their people by secession had forfeited 
their federal rights, and were subject to the 
supreme authority of Congress. Of this plan 
of reconstruction Mr. Scott says that if its 
champions had followed it to its logical con- 
clusion they would have had to concede that 
under any circumstances, those of reconstruc- 
tion included, their right of self-government 
had survived inviolate, and therefore that their 
restoration depended upon themselves. And 
he shows that no help could be found in the 
clause of the Constitution declaring that " the 
United States shall guarantee to every state in 
this Union a republican form, of government "; 



for a guarantee implies a pre-existing govern- 
ment which had ceased to be republican, while 
all the seceded states had governments repub- 
lican in form, which had been recognized as 
such by the United States from the beginning. 

Of the third plan of reconstruction, which 
was finally adopted by Congress, Mr. Scott 
says : 

" Much more manly and less dangerous were those 
who asserted that the seceded states, by the act of seces- 
sion and by maintaining this secession by force of arms, 
had placed themselves outside of the Union, and had 
become mere territories over which the federal govern- 
ment might exercise the rights of conquest. They knew 
well that any policy which had for its foundations the 
inequality of the states, the interference of the federal 
government in the affairs of a state within the Union, 
the subordination of the civil to the military power, and 
the abrogation of the rule of the majority, had no coun- 
tenance from anything within the four corners of the 
Constitution, and was in violation of the spirit as well 
as of the tenor of the bond of union. . . . This view 
placed the states without the pale of the Union and the 
Constitution; it made their soil conquered territory, to 
be disposed of as the United States should think fit, 
and making the rebels belligerents, handed them over 
when conquered to the mercy of the federal govern- 
ment." 

But Mr. Scott, nevertheless, condemns this 
plan quite as unsparingly as the two preceding 
ones. Taking his stand against all schemes of 
reconstruction as unwarranted by the Consti- 
tution, he believes the rebels, when conquered, 
had no duty to perform but to return to their 
allegiance, and that the government had no 
right to prescribe any conditions whatever. He 
emphasizes the words of Lincoln : " No state, 
upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get 
out of the Union." This is undoubtedly true ; 
but he does not say that it cannot do this un- 
lawfully. That an unlawful act cannot be done 
lawfully, is a simple truism ; but the effect or 
consequence of such act presents another ques- 
tion. The saying, " Once a state, always a 
state," is a mere legal fiction, like the state- 
ment of Chief Justice Chase that the govern- 
ment is " an indissoluble union of indestructi- 
ble states." The history of the world gives no 
account of an indestructible state, or an indis- 
soluble confederacy of states. Time and chance 
pertain to everything that is human. Mr. Scott 
evidently agrees with a great party leader of 
the reconstruction period, that there was " no 
power in the federal government to punish the 
people of a state collectively, by reducing it to 
a territorial condition, since the crime of trea- 
son is individual, aud can only be treated indi- 
vidually." A rebellious state would thus be- 
come independent. If her people could right- 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



13 



fully be overpowered by the national authority, 
that fact would at once re-clothe them with all 
their rights. Congress could prescribe no con- 
ditions, because this would be to recognize the 
states as territories, and violate the principle 
of state rights. This view made our war for 
the Union flagrantly unconstitutional ; for if 
the crime of treason was " individual," and 
could only be treated " individually," the Fed- 
eral government had no right to hold prisoners 
of war, seize property, and capture and confis- 
cate vessels ; for every rebel was in the full 
legal possession of his political rights, and 
could only be prevented from exercising them 
through a judicial conviction of treason in the 
district in which the overt act was committed. 

Mr. Scott misconceives the character of the 
plan of reconstruction he so earnestly con- 
demns. While it does not recognize the re- 
volted districts or states in the Union, it deals 
with their people as subject to the authority of 
the United States. As citizens of the United 
States, they could no more escape their obliga- 
tions than they could run away from their own 
shadows. Through their treason and rebellion 
they lost their rights under the Union, but the 
Union lost none of its rights over them. They 
did not and could not destroy the Union, or 
even abandon it, but simply forfeited their 
rights under it and thus subjected themselves 
to the coercive authority of the nation. When 
they ceased to be a mere mob, and became pub- 
lic enemies, this fact did not, as Mr. Scott sup- 
poses, " do away with their character as crim- 
inals and render punishment after subjection 
out of the question," because the law of nations 
determines the rights of nations in such cases, 
and one of these rights is the right of self- 
preservation. 

We admit that if the rebellion had been 
nipped in the bud, or had been abandoned be- 
fore it assumed its gigantic proportions, no 
reconstruction of the government would have 
been necessary. The punishment of the leaders 
might have been demanded, but nothing else 
would have been required but the return of the 
people in revolt to their allegiance. But when 
the conflict ceased to be any longer a mere 
insurrection against the national authority, and 
took upon itself the character of a war with a 
foreign power, as the Supreme Court of the 
United States decided, the insurgents became 
public enemies, and when conquered were the 
conquered enemies of the United States and 
subject to the power of the conqueror, accord- 
ing to the laws of war applicable to such a con- 



flict. The nation had the right to prescribe 
just such conditions as it saw fit, looking to 
indemnity for the past and security for the 
future. In doing this it violated no article or 
clause of the Constitution, but was governed 
by the laws of war recognized by all civilized 
governments, and by the Constitution itself. 
Nobody violated it but the parties who defied 
its authority and compelled the nation to defend 
itself against the attempt upon its own life. 
To argue that the men who carried on this 
work of devastation for four years in the name 
of State Rights should be allowed at the end 
of the conflict to set up State Rights as a bar 
to their accountability and a reason for their 
unconditional restoration to power, was a mock- 
ery of justice and an affront to common sense. 
It is perhaps superfluous to say that the bias 
of this volume is Southern. This is shown in 
the author's treatment of the Missouri Com- 
promise, of the Virginia and Kentucky Reso- 
lutions of 1798-9, and the question of Recon- 
struction. The work, however, is written in a 
spirit of fairness, giving the argument on both 
sides of important questions, and thus helping 
the reader to a just conclusion. It will serve 
a good purpose in the political education of the 
people. GEORGE W. JULIAN. 



THE PROCESSES OF CELL-LIFE.* 



Professor Patrick Geddes has lately pro- 
posed the name Bionomics to designate what 
has been vaguely termed the science of organic 
evolution. In this sense, Bionomics would be 
the science which treats of the changes and 
adaptations in living beings, and the laws that 
govern them. This term Bionomics seems to 
me a very desirable one, and the science which 
it covers is one that draws material from every 
conceivable source of human knowledge. The 
fact that all our knowledge is human, and must, 
if expressed at all, be stated in terms of human 
experience, brings all of it into some bionomic 
relation. The central question in Bionomics 
is that of the ancestry of the various groups, 
and the influences which have caused them to 
become what they are. The central idea in the 
study is that of life-adaptation ; and no influ-

ence which can affect life in any way falls out- 
side the range of bionomic science. 

For the last fifteen years the most fruitful 
line of research in the whole range of Bionom- 
ics has been that of the life processes of the 
cell, collectively known as ITaryokinesis, and 
in the relation of the cell-structures and func- 
tions to the laws of heredity. For the last 
fifty years, since the discoveries of Schleiden 
and Schwann of the cellular structure of ani- 
mals (1846), it has been recognized that the 
bodies of the higher animals, or metazoa, may 
be considered each as a colony or alliance of 
one-celled animals. These are bound together 
in relations of mutual help and mutual depend- 
ence. This alliance permits growth and spe- 
cialization, increase in size and strength with a 
physiological division of labor among the differ- 
ent parts, each organ being made of coordinate 
cells gathered together into tissues. From each 
of these organized beings or aggregations of 
cells, single cells are thrown off for purposes of 
reproduction. These germ-cells (ovum, sperma- 
tozoon) are in origin and nature similar to the 
tissue cells of which the body is composed. 
Each, again, is essentially similar to the one- 
celled organisms, or Protozoa, the supposed 
ancestors of the many-celled types. The many- 
celled body is derived from the ovum by a series 
of successive divisions, or cleavages ; the egg- 
cell dividing into two, four, eight, and so on, 
until a very large number of cells is produced. 
These remain together, building up tissues and 
organs, until a period of maturity of the com- 
pound structure is reached. Then other germ- 
cells are detached, which pass through similar 
cycles of growth. Among the descendants of 
each egg-cell, as stated by Professor Wilson, 
" a certain number assume the character of the 
original egg-cell, are converted into ova, and 
thus form the point of departure for the follow- 
ing generation. Every egg is therefore derived 
by a continuous and unbroken series of cell- 
divisions from the egg of the preceding gen- 
eration, and so on backward through all pre- 
ceding generations ; it is normally destined to 
form the first term in the series of cell-divisions 
extending indefinitely forward into the future." 

In this point of view, the egg and the com- 
pound individual into which it develops stand 
each as a link in an unbroken chain of life, 
extending backward to life's beginning, what- 
ever that may have been. For as each living 
e gg-cell is cast off from living cell-structures 
by processes of life, death has nowhere inter- 
vened in any series which is now extant. These 



chains of life tend to diverge, one from another ; 
while the destruction of those links in the chain 
of organisms not fitted to the conditions of life 
tends by exclusion toward the perpetuation of 
those better adapted. 

In some low types, the egg is capable of cell- 
division and growth (Parthenogenesis) without 
the addition of the male element. Cross-fer- 
tilization (Amphimisis) with its mixture of 
hereditary materials derived from different 
sources, is so useful in evolution that it has 
virtually superseded Parthenogesis. Its im- 
portance lies in this : that it is the chief factor 
in promoting individual variation. Through 
the survival of favorable variations result 
higher adaptation and specialization. In most 
compound animals, the egg is incapable of 
division or cleavage until it has been fertilized 
by a germ-cell of the opposite sex, similarly 
derived from the tissues of a living body. Fun- 
damentally, the egg and sperm-cell are alike in 
origin and character, and each bears the same 
relation to the phenomena of heredity. The 
ovum, by processes of adaptation, has become 
in the higher forms immovable, and charged 
with food substance. The sperm-cell is active, 
and carries only its hereditary material and the 
protoplasm necessary to its motion and main- 
tenance. 

All cells, whether germ-cells or not, consist, 
omitting minor details, of protoplasm and nu- 
cleus. In the protoplasm a network of jelly- 
like substance in a fluid the actions of cell- 
life take place ; while the nucleus, itself inert, 
presides over or directs the results of these 
actions. Both Protoplasm and Nucleus are 
elaborate structures, not mere chemical com- 
pounds, and in each the function depends upon 
structure and not on chemical composition. In 
the loops and bands of the chromatin, the es- 
sential part of the nucleus, rests in some way 
the plan of the growing organism, the ances- 
tral directive force, according to which the or- 
ganism must develop. In each case of cell- 
division, an elaborate mechanism (centrosome, 
asters, etc.) is developed in the protoplasm, by 
means of which the chromatin is subdivided, 
each of its elaborate loops and tangles being 
equally shared between the two daughter cells 
formed by self-cleavage. By this means each 
resultant cell is like its mother cell in essential 
respects. But again, as an absolutely equal 
division is unknown in nature, each daughter- 
cell has in some minute degree its own pecu- 
liarities, its own individuality, apparently re- 
sulting from inequalities in the chromatin. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



15 



These individual qualities, hidden in the de- 
termining chromatin, will reappear in the com- 
pound animal or individual into which the 
germ-cell develops. 

When the egg or sperm cell is mature and 
ready for fertilization, it differs from the or- 
dinary cells from which it is derived by con- 
taining only half the usual amount of chroma- 
tin or hereditary material. It is, therefore, so 
far as heredity goes, a half-cell, containing only 
half the architect's plan, or hereditary direct- 
ive force, according to which its development 
is to be governed. The process of fertilization 
is the union of two half-cells, by which each 
half contributes its share of hereditary material. 
These become mingled together in the nucleus 
of the fertilized ovum, or cleavage-cell. This 
is then a new individual, and in its develop- 
ment it proceeds along the lines indicated by 
the mixed chromatin, and the forces of hered- 
ity somehow resident in this. This mixture of 
characters shows itself in the resultant individ- 
ual. In this sense, the individual begins life 
as a mosaic of ancestral fragments, diverse and 
sometimes contradictory as to details, with a 
fundamental basis of unity in the traits of spe- 
cies and race which have come down from many 
ancestors unchanged, and changeable only by 
very slow accretions or modifications. 

Professor Edmund B. Wilson has rendered 
a great service to teachers and students in the 
publication of the splendid series of micropho- 
tographs of these different processes. Hitherto 
the student has had access only to descriptions 
and diagrams. The latter are always too ex- 
plicit for his best uses, inasmuch as they go 
beyond nature to someone's theory of what na- 
ture should be. In the forty photographic 
plates in Professor Wilson's atlas, all phases of 
changes in the ovum are shown as they appear 
in fact, with only the small source of error aris- 
ing from the processes of staining. These are 
accompanied by an admirably lucid text with 
many diagrammatic figures explanatory of the 
plates. DAVID STARR JORDAN. 



FOLK SOXGS AND STORIES OF THE

ume, " Bahama Songs and Stories," that it is 
not at all the equal of Heli Chatelain's " An- 
gola Tales." It is, however, an interesting and 
valuable contribution to folk-lore. 

The lovely Bahamas are, strangely, but lit- 
tle known. They comprise more than three 
thousand islands, most of which are very small. 
The Main Island is from fifty to one hundred 
miles long and from one to ten miles wide, 
with little hills that rise to one hundred feet 
in height covered with pine-trees of great size. 
Seaward from it are the cays, a chain of islets, 
repetitions in miniature of the main island, 
with smaller hills and stunted growth of shrubs 
and little trees, and with cocoa palms. Beyond 
them lies the reef. Island, cays, reef, all are 
coralline in origin. Color abounds everywhere : 
the vegetation is intensely green, the sea deeply 
blue, the coral sand dazzling white. And here 
there lives a curious population, pretty equally 
composed of blacks and whites, with the former 
slowly but constantly gaining. Thus our author 
describes the land and the people. After a 
brief but helpful sketch of their life and their 
ways, he presents their songs and their stories, 
songs and stories of negroes, negroes speak- 
ing English, but English of a quaint cockney 
sort, quite unlike the dialects among our South- 
ern negroes. Funny indeed is it to find these 
descendants of Africans dropping and misplac- 
ing their Ti as if London born and bred. " Hall 
right, 'e 'as 'is 'ogs 'ere," would be quite a pos- 
sible sentence among the Jamaica blacks. And 
their "vwas," "vw'en," "vwalk" are quite 
Wellerian. 

Of songs, our author has collected forty 
specimens, presenting music with the words. 
All of the pieces are religious in sentiment, 
more or less sombre in sentiment and rendi- 
tion, more or less grotesque in form and ver- 
bal content. Common among these negroes is 
the practice of sitting up all night to sing, the 
occasion being either joyous or doleful. Mr. 
Edwards describes the service of song

mony, makes such peculiarly touching music as I have 
never heard elsewhere." 

In an appendix upon Negro Music the author 
brings together a considerable amount of data 
and presents a bibliography of the subject. 

Thirty-eight Bahama stories are given. Many 
of them are very imperfect in sense and dis- 
jointed in structure. This may be the result 
of the fact that children, and not adults, are 
the usual narrators. There are two kinds of 
tales recognized, "old stories" and "fairy 
stories." The former are chiefly animal tales, 
analogous to the "Br'er Kabbit " stories of 
" Uncle Remus." The latter are chiefly of re- 
cent introduction from English sources. Rather 
curious is the variability of dialect ; the same 
word may be quite differently pronounced in 
successive sentences. The stories usually be- 
gin and end with some set formula. The open- 
ing is generally : 

" Once it vwas a time, a very good time, 
De monkey chewed tobacco an' 'e spit white lime." 

To which may be added : 

" T wa'nt my time, 't wa'nt you time ; 'twas old folks' time." 

The ending generally is : 

" E bo ban, my story 's en'; 
If you doan believe my story 's true 
Has my captain an' my crew. 
Vw'en I die, bury me in a pot o' candle grease." 

The three first lines are fixed ; the fourth va- 
ries. Space does not permit a detailed study 
of the stories. The variant of the " Tar Baby " 
story is curious. So is Story XX., where we 
have " Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves " done 
into Bahama. " Big Claus and Little Glaus " 
is terribly mangled, but has a quaint and 
original termination. Most of the fairy stories 
have peculiarly tragic terminations. As a sam- 
ple of dialect and of the old stories, we cite 
" B'Helephant an' B'Vw'ale " : 

" Now dis day B'Rabby vwas walkin' 'long de shore. 
'E see B'Vw'ale. 'E say, ' B'Vw'ale ! ' B'Vw'ale say, 
' Hey ! ' B'Rabby say, < B'Vw'ale, I bet I could pull 
you on de shore ! ' B'Vw'ale say, You cahnt ! ' B'Rabby 
say, < I bet you free t'ousan' dollar ! ' B'Vw'ale say, 
Hall right ! ' 'E gone." 

Brother Rabbit goes to find Brother Elephant, 
and makes a similar bet with him. Then, se- 
curing a strong rope, he succeeds in setting 
them against each other, both of them thinking 
that they are pulling against him. The rope 
breaks. 

" B'Vw'ale went in de ocean and B'Helephant vwent 
vay over in de pine-yard. Das v'y you see B'Vw'ale in 
de ocean to-day, and das vy you see B'Helephant over 
in de pine bushes to-day."

EURIPIDES THE RATIONALIST.* 

Naturally, a new book from Professor Ver- 
rall is suggestive, stimulating, compelling re- 
luctant assent at times, as often, again, 
arousing eager opposition. He writes, as 
usual, to break with accepted beliefs, and upon 
a question well worthy of discussion. That 
the present essay, "Euripides the Rationalist," 
is particularly fragmentary, and anything but 
final, its author would probably be the first to 
declare. Still, every real student of Greek 
drama indeed, every serious student of liter- 
ature should turn its leaves. 

It is universally conceded that Euripides' 
plots have nearly all a serious structural weak- 
ness. Doubtless every reader since Aristo- 
phanes has objected particularly to the long 
explanatory prologues, and to the spectacular 
finale wherein the " god from the machine " 
cuts the knot which the dramatist, or his char- 
acters, failed to untie through the natural in- 
evitable progress of the action. It has been 
noted, often, that these divine apparitions are 
much less vigorous and realistic than the hu- 
man characters. It was not left for Mr. Ver- 
rall first to point out, either, that all the men 
and women in, for instance, the " Hippolytos" 
are heroic, while all the divinities are ignoble. 
That such a drama seems a covert but deliber- 
ate attack upon the very existence of the pop- 
ular gods, has also been often remarked. 

Euripides was certainly not in personal nor 
artistic harmony with the popular theology of 
his time. He was forced into outward con- 
formity with it by the whole environment, the 
traditions, the limited materials of his art. 
Compared with his greatest rivals, he was a 
realist, yet was obliged to accept the machinery 
of romance : or, as Mr. Verrall would say, an 
earnest atheist, he was compelled to respect 
the conventions of a pulpit ! But Mr. Verrall 
advances far beyond these secure positions, 
and plants his standard boldly, declaring that 
Euripides used the drama chiefly, and persis- 
tently, for this one purpose of breaking down 
all belief in myth and miracle, in the inspira- 
tion of Delphi, in the very existence of Apollo 
and Athena. 

Mr. Verrall applies his tests, in detail, only 
to three plays altogether : The " Alcestis," the 
" Ion," the " Iphigenia in Tauris." In general, 
he attempts to divide each drama into a central

plot, wherein purely human motives and ac- 
tions leave no room for the marvellous, and a 
tableau before, or after, or both, which satis- 
fied the popular conservatism, while at the 
same time impressing upon every thoughtful 
mind the helplessness, the dishonesty, the un- 
reality, of the people's gods. As to the 
" Ion," Mr. Verrall in 1890 worked out this 
theory much more fully, in an annotated edi- 
tion and translation. Here he seems to the 
present reader to have an unanswerable argu- 
ment in the main. Apollo is indeed a shame- 
faced and baffled liar at the end of the play, 
a brutal libertine from the beginning. Here, 
certainly, Euripides hardly retains any pre- 
tense of belief at all. His spectacular Pallas, 
at the close, only silences for the instant, at 
best, the voice of common-sense and right im- 
pulse. Apollo himself fails to appear, and no 
serious attempt is made to excuse his absence 
or his previous behavior. 

Yet even here Mr. Verrall seems over in- 
genious in his detailed reconstruction of what 
Euripides, as he thinks, meant to show us 
really took place. Still less can we promptly 
agree that Alcestis evidently fainted only, from 
hysterical excitement, under the delusion of a 
doom appointed her. Heracles, to Mr. Verrall, 
is but a drunken braggart, who, entering the 
tomb, found the lady awake, and escorted her 
quietly back to the palace. If this were all 
quite evident, it should have been evident long 
ago. Milton, for instance, should have seen 
that " sad Electra's poet," he who brought back 
" Alcestis from the grave," was but a scoffer ! 

We are not quite willing, then, to have our 
poet's consistency, his single-minded devotion 
to a cause, defended at such a terrible cost. 
We do not believe the creative imagination, the 
artistic delight in his work, could coexist so 
long in Euripides with pure scientific agnosti- 
cism. Disbelief, to be inculcated by " innu- 
endo" (Mr. Verrall's favorite word), corrodes 
the soul itself, as examples like Lucian, Vol- 
taire, and Swift remind us. 

But we think Mr. Verrall will be compelled 
by compulsion from within at least to 
apply his method to the whole list of extant 
plays, or at any rate to most of them. The 
study will be by no means barren, even if the 
final verdict on the main question be "Not 
proven," or even " Not probable." Especially 
interesting are his sketches of the many-minded 
keen-witted critical audience to which Euri- 
pides appealed, the reminders that the poet 
was not merely heard once, but read and dis- 



cussed all the year round, in general, the 
attempt to reconstruct the fifth century Athe- 
nian conditions. For all the imagination, the 
literary taste, the open-mindedness of Mr. Ver- 
rall, classical scholarship has abundant cause 
for gratitude. 

Like his rival in iconoclasm, the German 
Wilamowitz, Mr. Verrall often sallies into the 
field before his forces are quite assembled and 
fully under control. Thus, a straggling argu- 
ment on page 172 tells us " the Medea was one 
of a group which gained not only a prize, but 
the first." In our meagre and fragmentary 
knowledge on such matters, hardly any one fact 
is more interesting than that in the historic 
year 431 B.C. JEschylus' son, the heir of his 
art, was placed first, Sophocles second, while 
Euripides with the Medea took the third or 
" booby " prize ! 

Professor Verrall's style is not so clear, 
bright, and graceful as Mr. Jebb's ; and the 
subtlety of his arguments makes this doubly 
apparent. " No one who is accustomed to lit- 
erary composition will doubt that the Phoe- 
nissce did not originally conclude with the de- 
parture of CEdipus," etc. (p. 242). Everyone 
accustomed to literary composition will see 
clearly that the third negative bewilders nearly 
every mind. 

Lastly, hasty readers may be warned that 
the general thesis will be found in the preface, 
while the final summing-up is on pp. 259-60, 
attached, perhaps by accident, to a very ingen- 
ious brief essay which has little essential bear- 
ing on the rest of the book. At any rate, 
these last paragraphs should be marked off as 
Epilogue. WILLIAM C. LAWTON.

tinctly formal transaction, and, at the same time, 
on the life of Christ as giving vital relations. The 
two conceptions mutually exclude each other. When 
he is to us the way, the truth, the life, the growing 
source of a spiritual experience, we cannot attach 
much importance to any alleged reconciliation under 
a violated law. Being reconciled with God, we 
have no feeling left for any formal conflict between 
us. Hence, it has happened, while the dogma of 
salvation in Christ has lost ground, the fact of sal- 
vation in Christ has correspondingly gained ground. 
The thoughts of men are more than ever turning to 
him, and are laying hold of his life and words with 
unusual insight. 

" Jesus as a Teacher," by Prof. B. A. Hinsdale, 
is a sober, substantial, well-digested book. It em- 
braces knowledge, perception, and feeling. While 
its perusal would be profitable to most readers, it 
would be especially profitable to the better class of 
Sunday-school teachers. It holds itself more aloof 
from the merely formal side of truth, and gives 
itself more freely to its vital aspects than one would 
expect it to do as arising in the interests of peda- 
gogy. The volume carefully presents the circum- 
stances which imparted character to the teachings 
of Christ, as well as a full consideration of his spirit 
and method. It embraces a second part, " The 
Making of the New Testament." 

It is not easy to give an adequate conception of 
the book entitled " Christ's Idea of the Supernat- 
ural." Each reader, as in testing a fruit of an un- 
usual flavor, must pronounce upon it for himself. 
There is so much individuality in it that it will 
please and instruct different persons very differently. 
To many, it may easily become a manual of heav- 
enly things. It is pervaded by a tone of very pos- 
itive spirituality. The thought and the feeling are 
so closely interwoven that the reader must share 
them both, if he is to catch the impulse of the au- 
thor. The line of presentation, like the path of a 
bird in flight, must be seen as it is evolved, as it 
escapes the eye almost at once. There is a great 
deal of beauty as well as of force in the volume. 
The author moves with alert and sympathetic steps 
along the lines of spiritual affinity. 

In spite of much difference, the work is not 
unlike " Studies in Theologic Definition," a book 
also marked by insight and strong conviction. The 
purpose of both authors is to readjust our religious 
conceptions to the allotted conditions of knowledge. 
Both feel painfully the fact that religious convic- 
tion has lost ground in many minds by that which 
ought rather to have purified and strengthened it. 
The ruling idea by which Dr. Denison would recon- 
cile the natural and supernatural, the earthly and 
the divine, is that of coordination the coOrdir.a- 
tion by which each living thing is put in vital rela- 
tions to the very different things which surround it. 
As physical life links together in one experience the 
organic and inorganic, so does a higher spiritual 
life lay hold of the sensuous facts beneath it and 
the supersensuous ones above it. This conception 



is handled in a wide facile way, and is made very 
fruitful. The idea which Mr. Palmer finds equally 
pregnant is that the finite and the infinite are not 
opposed to each other, but that the infinite fully 
contains the finite. So the two are, and have been, 
in perfect reconciliation. Our exaltations of God 
have often been a driving of him out of his own 
word and works, the building up of an abstraction 
in place of an apprehension of concrete facts and 
a divine history. This conception the author de- 
velops with fulness and skill, and so will render a 
vital service to those who can readily accompany 
him. One feels, in reference to both these authors, 
that they thread the jungle with such swift and 
sturdy steps because they follow a path that wont 
and use have made familiar to them. In the light 
or out of the light, they escape, by the habit of their 
own minds, the entanglements and wanderings 
which others experience. This certainty of thought 
is a perfectly normal product in all higher, more 
complex, and spiritual themes. A bird gets the 
knack of the air by flying. We learn how thought 
and perception and feeling spring up and flow to- 
gether by standing where the full streams of life 
lie at our feet. We can easily believe that both 
books, flowing as they do from a vital experience, 
will carry refreshment and vitality with them. 

We cannot speak with as much confidence of the 
next volume, " The Christian Consciousness." To 
give such a definition to Christian Consciousness as 
to make it a distinct and productive source of power 
in human life, and to trace its way onward fertil- 
izing the thoughts and feelings of men, constitutes 
a most difficult task. We do not think that the 
author has attained that firmness in the original 
idea, or that clearness in the sequence of events 
under it which are necessary to render the discus- 
sion stimulating and fruitful. The things devel- 
oped do not turn with sufficient definiteness on the 
theme proposed. 

" The Preacher and His Place " is a volume of 
lectures delivered at the Yale Theological Seminary. 
These lectures, in common with most of the courses 
which have preceded them, cling pretty closely to 
the peculiar practical wants which lie before the 
preacher in our time. These courses have been 
delivered by those who are in actual service, and 
supplement rather than continue the seminary work 
in Homilities. This fact is indicated in the present 
course by the titles of the several lectures. The 
first four titles are : " The Preacher and the Past," 
" The Preacher and the Present," " The Preacher 
and his Message," " The Preacher and other Mes- 
sages." The lectures of Dr. Greer are enjoyable. 
The style is pleasing and perspicuous ; the subject- 
matter is interesting, and the temper serene. They 
are penetrative without being profound, earnest 
rather than fervid, and progressive while marked by 
no radicalism. They carry the mind forward with- 
out jar, evoking general acquiescence, and render 
the vision more clear and pleasurable in many direc- 
tions. They will be profitable to most ministers.

THE DIAL 



" College Sermons " is made up of discourses de- 
livered by Professor Jowett to the students of Bal- 
liol College, during his long term of service. They 
are admirably fitted to do college men good. They 
express the wise, sober convictions of a well-trained 
mind, earnest and devout in its temper, and regard- 
ing religious belief and action chiefly on their prac- 
tical side. Supported by the personal confidence 
and reverence which Professor Jowett commanded, 
they must have been a very direct and irresistible 
means of good. The temper of the discourses, as 
became a scholar, is eminently liberal and charita- 
ble. Their purpose, pursued in a simple, unimpas- 
sioned way, is to sober, widen, stimulate, and 
strengthen the thoughts of young men. They are 
especially suited for this work. They are in sym- 
pathy with a large and purified life. The editorial 
work of this volume has not been very thoroughly 
done. 

These six books, taken collectively, like many 
others that have come before us, show no decay in 
the Christian spirit. They all involve an effort 
a vital and prosperous effort to restate religious 
truth, and readjust it to the new and better condi- 
tions which have come to it. This is not weakness, 
but strength; not decay, but growth. The large 
adaptability of our faith and the emboldened and 
higher spirit which it so readily assumes are con- 
spicuous in such discourses as these of Professor 
Jowett a man of ripe scholarship, sober thought, 



and wide life. 



JOHN BASCOM. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. Stuart J. Eeid's life of Lord 
John Russell is one of the best of the 
interesting series of political biogra- 
phies (" Queen's Prime Ministers " Harper) of 
which the author is general editor. A finer subject 
could, of course, hardly be desired. From the days 
when Napoleon was changing the map of Europe 
almost at his will until the time of our own Civil 
War, Lord John Russell was in the House of Com- 
mons, and prominent from the first ; and this splen- 
did service was crowned with five years more of 
distinguished service as Earl Russell in the Foreign 
Office and as Prime Minister. During this whole 
career Lord John was the champion of the Whig 
principles of religious toleration and equality, and 
of the participation of the people in the government 
through widened suffrage and reformed representa- 
tion in Parliament. Himself a member of one of 
the proudest families of England, he outran even 
the bulk of the Whig party in his zeal for reform. 
In these days it is difficult to realize the exclusive- 
ness of the aristocratic spirit that prevailed among 
the ruling class at the beginning of this century. 
Men of broad culture, open minds, and patriotic 
impulses feared the overthrow of all the barriers 
against revolution if any slightest change were made 



in the institutions of the land. Lord John Russell 
identified himself with reform movements at the 
outset ; the cause of parliamentary reform was so 
peculiarly his own that he was chosen to introduce 
the great measure of 1832, although not yet of cab- 
inet rank. The beginnings of popular education 
were made or fostered by him against the strenuous 
opposition of his own class. So, though his vision 
was not always clear, and he sometimes was found 
opposing what he ought by his own principles to 
have favored, his influence in bringing England out 
from the aristocratic and mediaeval conditions pre- 
vailing before 1832 into the democratic equality of 
to-day was very great. The fault of Mr. Reid's 
book is one that is almost inseparable from the 
biographical method of writing history, especially 
when the writer is a thorough admirer of his sub- 
ject. While the statements of the book are in the 
main correct and the point of view is the right one, 
yet the concentration of attention upon one actor 
necessarily magnifies his part in events. Although 
the author points out the mistaken judgments and 
acts of his hero, there is not enough allowance made 
for the work of others. Especially defective is the 
treatment of the relations of England and America 
in our Civil War. Mr. Reid sees in the Alabama 
question only a petty quarrel in which we were 
over-sensitive and England was in no way at fault ; 
but that she preferred to humble herself rather than 
be on hostile terms with us. Lord John Russell, 
who was Foreign Secretary at that time, was not 
wont to tamely yield the rights and prestige of En- 
gland without compelling reason, nor was this con- 
sistent with England's past. 

It is often rather unjustly supposed 
that a critic ought not to make his 
appearance in imaginative literature 
unless he can show how the thing should be done by 
example as well as by precept. But there is no real 
reason to suppose that Herr Nordau, for instance, 
could write better plays, even from his own stand- 
point, than Dr. Ibsen, or better novels than M. Zola. 
If one read " The Right to Love " and " The Com- 
edy of Sentiment" (F. Tennyson Neely) without 
knowing that they were by the great scourge of 
contemporary literature, one would not trouble much 
to consider one's impressions. They are both of 
that kind of literature which used to be mildly con- 
demned as aping French wickedness, but which is 
now a favorite form with several popular moral- 
ists of our time. The first is a drama which shows- 
how an unfaithful wife finds the path of unfaith- 
fulness not so smooth as she had imagined; the 
second is a novel which presents a German profes- 
sor in love with a bold-faced but charming adven- 
turess. Both allure to virtue (in a measure) by 
showing the thorns on the rose-bush of vice. Neither, 
on the whole, does much more : the drama gets 
along without real characters or situations, the novel 
has no real atmosphere. Both have certain good 
points, the idea of finally giving the unrepent-

ant wife the position of housekeeper to her hus- 
band is quaint, to say the least ; and one rushes 
through the tale of the professor's intrigue, with a 
great desire to know how he is going to get out of 
it. Speculating upon these works as being written 
by the same hand which turned out " Degeneration," 
we are led to wonder whether Herr Nordau be not 
really an ornament, albeit a modest one, of the lit- 
erature of imagination rather than of the literature 
of knowledge. But, to tell the truth, this is a mat- 
ter upon which many people have made up their 
minds some time since. 

Even those who have never read the 
"Breitmann Ballads " by Mr. Charles 
G. Leland and there must be some 
such can hardly fail to catch from " Hans Breit- 
mann in Germany " (Lippincott) a flavor at once 
distinct and genial. The hearty self-confidence, 
impossible in one who is not sure of himself and 
his readers, the strange fact that the dialect is never 
tiresome, the clear refreshment of the relapses into 
good German, these make a sort of quaint toning 
in which one perceives pleasurably the humorist at 
work, gravely subduing and bringing under control 
the great mountainous jokes and scattering the 
smaller ones with a winning artlessness. But the 
book has its other vein also, so that one goes com- 
fortably along, enjoying the conversation in prose, 
enjoying the ingenuously extempore verse, some- 
times warmed by a glow of genuine warm-hearted- 
ness, sometimes surprised by the sudden appearance 
of a quaint moral coming so seldom and so unex- 
pectedly that one is rather pleased than vexed. 
Even the tarry-at-home would enjoy the book ; but 
to another the all-penetrating influence of the Vater- 
land brings a sudden revival of connection with the 
high-pitched roofs and the winding streets, with the 
beautiful gardens and the well -remembered bier- 
lokals, of the hundreds of characteristic things that 
remain with everyone, the mention of one of which 
is enough to bring back on a sudden the old-time 
feeling of inverted homesickness. A curiously at- 
tractive book, doubtless much of its charm lies in 
the constant temper of the scholar and the man of 
culture beneath the cheerful features, displayed in 
the frontispiece, of the sympathetic humorist. It is 
to be hoped that it will be favorably reviewed and 
widely read, for upon such circumstances, we are 
given to understand, hangs the appearance of more 
volumes of the same kind. 



The history 
of Bohemia. 



It is a pity that the history of Bo- 
hemia is so little known and appre- 
ciated by the English-speaking peo- 
ples. ^ Americans especially should know and admire 
a nation that, centuries earlier, stood for the princi- 
ples of Plymouth Rock and American liberty. In 
Bohemia those same political and religious princi- 
ples worked out their natural result in a high-spirited, 
cultured, and freedom-loving people. But Bohemia 
was small ; greedy neighbors were powerful ; the 



all-dominating Papacy marshalled its armies to 
crush out by force the alien and dangerous spirit 
of a people that chance had brought under the do- 
minion of one of its sons ; division and religious 
strife entered to weaken and paralyze the effective 
energies of the Bohemians themselves; and thus 
the land of John Hus became the Bohemia of to- 
day. Before the Thirty Years' War, nine-tenths 
Protestant, all opposition to the Church was ruth- 
lessly suppressed and Protestantism disappeared. 
Two histories of Bohemia have lately been written, 
with the double purpose of giving to the English- 
speaking descendants of Bohemia in America a 
knowledge of their motherland, and of opening to 
others the stirring story of Bohemia's struggles and 
achievements. The first is an elaborate work of 
seven hundred and fifty pages by Robert H. Vick- 
ers, published by C. H. Sergei & Co., Chicago. It 
is furnished with maps, illustrations, and index, and 
can be commended as a thorough treatment of the 
subject. The other work is less pretentious, being 
a compilation under the title of " The Story of Bo- 
hemia," by Frances Gregor (published by Cranston 
& Curts, Cincinnati). This volume also has illustra- 
tions, but lacks an index. It gives a full outline of 
the history in about half the compass of the larger 
work. 

Biographical Romantic and entertaining as fiction

Susan cooiidge. Migs gusan Coolidge) gat hered into 

a volume called " An Old Convent School in Paris, 
and Other Papers" (Roberts). The characters 
who figure in these sketches are real personages, 
and the author seems to have had access to sources, 
in the shape of diaries, memoirs, and autobiogra- 
phies, not commonly accessible. These being used 
with much literary art, a remarkably picturesque 
series of narratives is the result. The subject in 
each case is some person of high social or political 
distinction. The first two papers have to do with 
a Polish princess of the eighteenth century ; the 
third with that terrible woman-emperor, Catherine 
II. of Russia. At her death, a sealed manuscript 
was found among her papers an autobiography of 
the early years of her married life, written in her 
own hand, and addressed to her son, the Grand 
Duke Paul, great-grandfather of the present Czar. 
At first kept in the imperial archives and guarded 
with scrupulous care, this manuscript finally, in some 
unexplained manner, was copied, found its way to 
Paris, and into print. One of the copies, rare and 
hard to come by, has served Miss Cooiidge as basis 
for " The Girlhood of an Autocrat." A story of 
English official life in India bears the title " Miss 
Eden," the authority being three volumes of de- 
lightful letters written by the sister of Lord Auck- 
land, Governor-General of India; the concluding 
paper takes us into the French court of Louis XIV. 
through the memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon. 
The book is one to instruct as well as delight, and 
is suited to readers old or young.

Lotto " (Putnam) will hardly prove 
Italian Painting, interesting reading to the average 
person. It is not, strictly speaking, a biography, 
but " an Essay in Constructive Art-Criticism," as the 
secondary title tells us. The matter of it has been 
of more moment to the author than the style of it. 
The author has had something to say, and has not 
cared too much about how he has said it. So, begin- 
ning with a catalogue of facts, as though he were 
a German instead of an American, he ends with a 
conclusion, logical enough, if it does not meet with 
entire acceptance. He has reconstructed the mas- 
ters and influences of Lorenzo Lotto, and incident- 
ally overhauled the history of early Venetian art to 
prove (what is undoubtedly true) that the Bellini 
were not the only teachers in Venice in Lotto's 
early days, and that there was a large following of 
the now-neglected Vivarini from whom Lotto de- 
scended, rather than, as formerly supposed, from 
the Bellini. What this book proves about Lotto and 
the early Venetian school is perhaps not so import- 
ant as the method taken to prove it. We are here 
brought face to face with the working of the Higher 
Criticism in art the scientific method of arriving 
at the authorship of pictures. Mr. Berenson, since 
the death of Morelli, has become its high priest ; 
and while people may smile as they please about 
the art-criticism which consists in measuring ears 
and finger-nails and studying draperies and back- 
grounds, it is yet the only accurate basis upon which 
the study of ancient painting can rest. Moreover, 
Mr. Berenson has modified the method of Morelli, 
and is not flinging aside all the views of the past 
as " antiquated rubbish." Where he establishes a 
new view, he does it with a reason and with a mas- 
tery of facts that few will venture to dispute. In- 
deed, Mr. Berenson is to be treated seriously and 
with respect, not sneered at, as was the unjust fate 
of his learned forerunner, Giovanni Morelli. It is 
understood to be his ambition to rewrite the his- 
tory of Italian painting ; and, if we take his " Lo- 
renzo Lotto " aright, the book is merely to show us 
the method whereby he proposes to execute his 
larger task. A new and critical history of Italian 
art is much needed ; and if every important Italian 
painter is treated with the thorough study that char- 
acterizes the present volume, we shall have an 
epoch-making work. 

The sight of Mr. E. L. Godkin's 
shapely volume of " Reflections and 
Comments " (Scribner) calls to mind 
Matthew Arnold's curt comment in his recently pub- 
lished Letters : " Far the best paper here is the 
< Evening Post,' written by Godkiu." Few culti- 
vated Americans, we fancy, will gainsay Mr. Ar- 
nold here at least very flatly. Mr. Godkin's writ- 
ing has long been a potent social and political force 
in this country ; and in so far as it lies in the way 
of the journalist qua journalist to do good in the 
society he lives in, he has done it. The volume is 



A volume of

made up of thirty-three articles selected from the 
author's contributions to " The Nation " during the 
past thirty years. Those have been chosen, of 
course, which seemed to him of most permanent 
value ; and while their prevailing tone is social and 
literary, political themes have not been avoided. 
Among the titles we note : " The Short-Hairs " and 
" The Swallow-Tails," " Organs," Panics," " John 
Stuart Mill," " Role of the Universities in Politics," 
" Physical Force in Politics," " The Evolution of 
the Summer Resort," " Tyndall and the Theolo- 
gians," etc. Ranging in tone, as in theme, from 
grave to gay, the volume shows Mr. Godkih at his 
best and Mr. Godkin is, as we all know, an engag- 
ing as well as a sound and scholarly writer. Some 
of the papers, it may be fairly said, are literature, 
not journalism. 

The census of 1890 indicated that 
there were at that time in the United 
States 1,535,597 persons who were 
born in Scandinavian countries or were children of 
Scandinavian parents. An enumeration to-day, tak- 
ing into account grand-children and great-grand- 
children, would show upwards of two million of 
representatives of this blood among us, these being 
scattered through every state and territory of the 
Union. Professor Rasmus B. Anderson, the well- 
known champion of the Northmen, has recently 
published a volume of nearly five hundred pages, 
well-arranged and well-indexed, which he calls a 
" first chapter " in the history of Norwegian Immi- 
gration, from 1821-1840. There were very few 
Scandinavians in the United States before 1821. 
In the years between that time and 1840, six main 
settlements were made: one in Orleans county, 
New York ; one in LaSalle county, Illinois ; one in 
Chicago ; three in Wisconsin ; besides a number of 
smaller colonies elsewhere. Himself the son of 
immigrants of 1836, Mr. Anderson has gathered a 
vast fund of information about the Norwegians, 
showing in some measure the contribution which 
they have made to the history of the world, and 
especially to that of the United States of America. 
The privations of the pioneers are well set forth, 
and a large number of biographical sketches are 
given, which, interspersed with pictures of individ- 
uals, of homes, and of public buildings, will be of 
great service to the thoughtful historian of later 
years, who, looking at the cosmopolitan population 
of this country, attempts to show what each race- 
element has contributed to its upbuilding. Others 
have presented the claims of the Scotch, the Irish, 
the Scotch-Irish, the French, the Huguenots as a 
special branch of French, the Dutch, the Pennsyl- 
vania Dutch, the Germans, and the Welsh, and this 
new volume will be welcomed as a valuable addi- 
tion to the growing literature of American popula- 
tion. A creditable list of the names of prominent 
persons of this Norwegian descent might be made ; 
but far more satisfactory is the feeling, which many 
share with Mr. Anderson, that the stock has been

uniformly excellent, and welcomed everywhere dur- 
ing the busy three-score years and ten since the first 
stragglers came to cast their lot in the Western land. 
Occasionally in the volume there are indications of 
what might be written in a " second chapter," but 
the pioneer historian is the one who is especially to 
be commended, for the collection of material from 
the older citizens, who are fast dying out, is far 
more difficult than the compilation of facts about 
the life of the period since 1840. The book is pub- 
lished by the author, at Madison, Wis. 

Mr. 0. W. Nixon's narration of 
" How Marcus Whitman Saved Ore- 
gon" (Star Publishing Co., Chicago) 
is the work of an enthusiast rather than an histo- 
rian, and is a collection of newspaper sketches rather 
than a book. The story of Marcus Whitman, with 
reference both to his ride to save Oregon and to 
the tragedy at Waiilatpui, has already been ade- 
quately told, and in much better English, by Mr. 
Barrows, in his volume on Oregon for the " Com- 
monwealths Series." The present work, although 
based upon tradition mainly, is substantially cor- 
rect in its statements ; yet there is an atmosphere 
of rhapsody for the hero and of disparagement for 
those whom he overcame which is not historical. 
Mr. Barrows has given the true setting of the story 
with regard to Daniel Webster, and it is not neces- 
sary to belittle him in order to magnify Whitman's 
great service. The proof-reading of this work is very 
careless, and the author's English is most slovenly, 
while his dates are occasionally incorrect for stand- 
ard events. The " Introduction," by another hand, 
illustrates one of the abuses of bookmaking. If the 
book is worth anything, it should go on its own 
merits ; and this introduction by the Rev. Frank W. 
Gunsaulus does not help it. It would be difficult to 
put into four scant pages more bad English, mixed 
figure, and distortion of historical proportion. One 
knows not what to say of such a statement as this 
concerning Whitman : " He was more to the ulte- 
rior Northwest than John Harvard has ever been to 
the Northeast of our common country." 

Few works of equal length have 

Stories of the i-\ t t ^i i r 

Wagner operas, called torth so large an amount of 
comment and criticism as the eleven 
operas of Richard Wagner. The author has been 
discussed as poet, as musical composer, as drama- 
tist ; his theories have been recklessly assailed and 
as recklessly praised ; his character and career as a 
man have been in turn lauded and decried. A cat- 
alogue of a Wagner library, compiled by an en- 
thusiastic bibliographer and published some years 
ago, had already reached three large octavo vol- 
umes, and many additions have since accumulated. 
A new book on Wagner, covering new ground, 
would seem to be almost impossible ; yet such an 
one has just come to hand in Mr. H. A. Guerber's 
" Stories of the Wagner Operas " (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.). The charm of the book is in its adherence 



to the simple aim expressed by its title. No at- 
tempt is made to discuss the " music of the future," 
to discourse of aria parlante or leit-motif, nor even 
to deal with the author's biography except so far 
as it concerns the choice of his subjects and the 
sources of his inspiration. The stories of the Wag- 
ner music dramas are here retold in straightforward 
and attractive prose, according to the same princi- 
ple that has made Mr. Guerber's other books so pop- 
ular. The illustrations, one for each story, are of 
uncommon beauty, some being copies of familiar 
designs by the best masters, and others being ap- 
parently drawn specially for this work. 

A volume from The appointment of Lord Acton as 
Fronde's successor Regius Prof essor of History at Cam- 
at Cambridge. bridge, to succeed Froude, aroused 
much interest last winter, and not a little curiosity 
to know more of his life and work than had pre- 
viously been made public. For many years it has 
been noticeable that when English scholars have 
spoken of Lord Acton, it has been in terms of the 
greatest respect, although he has published hardly 
anything. On June 11, he delivered his inaugural 
lecture at Cambridge, and this is now printed in a, 
small volume called " A Lecture on the Study of 
History " (Macmillan). A single lecture, of course, 
cannot provide sufficient material to justify so great 
a reputation as that which Lord Acton has so long 
enjoyed, but as far as it goes it shows that in him 
Freeman and Froude have found no unworthy suc- 
cessor. It reveals wide reading and philosophic 
breadth of manner, although there are indications 
that the writer has not fully digested his vast stores 
of information. The notes, which are about twice 
as voluminous as the text of the lecture proper, ad- 
mit us perhaps too freely into the secrets of his 
workshop. It would be interesting to know who is 
responsible for the bad proof-reading of this vol- 
ume, which has necessitated a list of no less than 
forty-three errata ; even in the list itself we have 
detected two errors and one unintelligible correction.

of the immense debt of Shakespeare

study has been undertaken by Dr. Mary Augusta 
Scott, who has aimed to bring together, with suit- 
able annotation, the titles of the many Elizabethan 
translations from Italian into English. She has 
already collected, she informs us, " more than one 
hundred and sixty translations from the Italian, 
made by ninety or more translators, including nearly 
every well-known Elizabethan author, except Shake- 
speare and Bacon." In a pamphlet entitled "Eliza- 
bethan Translations from the Italian," now pub-

America, Dr. Scott presents a first instalment of 
the fruits of her research, in the shape of a cata-

logue of English versions of Italian novelle. Trans- 
lations of poetry, plays, metrical romances, and 
miscellaneous books are reserved for enumeration 
in the subsequent papers. The present publication 
may be described as an expansion of Warton's 
chapter on " Translation of Italian Novels." The 
subject is one of much importance to students of 
English literature, and we shall await with interest 
the further papers promised by Dr. Scott. She 
already estimates that one-third of the extant Eliza-

one way or another." 

A century of the Under the title of The Constitution 
Constitution of the of the United States at the End of 
the First Century" (Heath), Mr. 
George S. Boutwell publishes a manual presenting 
the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of 
Confederation, the Northwest Territorial Ordi- 
nance, and the Constitution of 1787 ; the last- 
named document accompanied with annotations, 
section by section, giving the decisions of the Su- 
preme Court relating thereto, and followed by a 
copious and convenient analytical index of its vari- 
ous provisions. A chapter on "the progress of 
American Independence and its basis in the law of 
England " gives a clear summary of the events 
which evidence the growth of the disposition toward 
independency, beginning in the seventeenth century, 
and illustrating the evolution of the idea out of the 
principles of the British Constitution. This chap- 
ter is a valuable contribution to our national history. 
Succeeding chapters take up, clause by clause, the 
provisions of our Constitution, stating in familiar 
language the purport and effect of the judicial opin- 
ions in which these provisions have severally been 
expounded. The manual will be of value to con- 
stitutional students, and will doubtless interest a 
large circle of non-professional readers of our con- 
stitutional history.

the various departments, which are printed at the

Bullock, of The Finances of the United States 
from 1775 to 1789, with especial reference to the 
Budget." The Revolutionary period is of such im- 
portance that it has frequently been chosen for spe- 
cial investigation by students of American financial 
history ; but on the other hand the mode of proced- 
ure in making appropriations, which is the particu- 
lar subject of Mr. Bullock's inquiry, has usually been 
neglected by American writers on finance. This 



essay gives evidence of much patient research among 
governmental records and possesses interest for the 
student as showing the development of budgetary 
methods in America.

A volume of enter- i . i * < . < j i 

taming dog-stories, easil 7 the chief est of dog-lovers, as 
is most apparent from the fact that 
he fills columns of his most esteemed political and 
literary journal, " The Spectator," with dog-stories. 
From the hundreds of these stories, Mr. J. St. Loe 
Strachey has made selections for a volume of " Dog 
Stories" (Macmillan). However, we cannot com- 
mend the editor's work very highly. The introduc- 
tion is of little value, and the classification clumsy : 
e.g., he separates the " syllogistic " dog from the 
" reasoning " ! Again, the stories on pages 208-9 
plainly belong under the heading, Dogs and Lan- 
guage ; and the story on page 198 is clearly not a 
dog-story at all, but a cow-story. The only thing 
of any very serious scientific interest in the volume 
is Sir John Lubbock's two letters on teaching dogs 
to read. This book, however, is not meant for the 
scientist, but for the dog-lover, to whom it will ap- 
peal most effectually by its many very interesting 
narratives of actual experiences. 

Mr. Frank Samuel Child's An Old

acter in Fairfield, Conn. New England towns have 
borne a conspicuous part in the moulding of our so- 
cial life and political institutions ; and few of them 
have won a more honorable distinction in this direc- 
tion than the one that is here described. The au- 
thor has gleaned his material from the best public 
and private sources, and his little book is brimful 
of that saving spirit of old-time American patriot- 
ism which such societies as the Daughters of the 
Revolution tend (or should tend) to perpetuate.. 
The work is plentifully illustrated with photogra- 
vure plates of Fairfield views and worthies. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Half a dozen of M. Zola's short stories, put into ex- 
ceptionally finished and accurate English by Mr. W. F. 
Apthorp, make up a small volume entitled " Jacques 
d' Amour " (Copeland & Day) . The other stories are 
" Madame Neigeon," Nantas," " How We Die," " The 
Coqueville Spree," and The Attack on the Mill." The 
publishers have made a striking book of this collection 
by imitating (although in cloth covers) the common 
French style of lettering for the outside of their paper- 
covered publications. The effect is so pretty that we 
hope to see more of it. 

There are good names, such as those of Dr. Garnett

very fair pictures as well; but the volume includes 
nothing striking, unless it be the amusing screed about 
current literary criticism, which takes the form of " a 
letter to the editor," and is signed " The Yellow Dwarf." 
Messrs. Copeland & Day are the American publishers 
of this quarterly magazine. 

The annual bound volume of " St. Nicholas " and 
the " Century " magazine are at hand, no less attract- 
ive than the broad shelf-full of their predecessors. The 
" St. Nicholas " volume is in two parts, covering a whole 
year, while the " Century " volume is for the six months 
ending last October. The former has articles by Pro- 
sessor Brander Matthews, Mr. Rudyard Kipling, Mr. 
Theodore Roosevelt, and others; the latter gives us a 
large section of Professor Sloane's " Life of Napoleon " 
as its chief feature, flanked by all sorts of timely and 
readable contributions in the shape of essays, descrip- 
tive papers, stories, and poems. 

" Langland's Vision of Piers the Plowman," trans- 
lated into modern English prose by Miss Kate M. War- 
ren (Imported by Putnam), provides university exten- 
sion circles and amateur students of our literature with 
an excellent introduction to the work of Chaucer's great 
contemporary. While the book makes no pretence of 
being more than a compilation, it is praiseworthy for 
the careful use that has been made of the best author- 
ities, and for the quality of its language. The style of 
the translation is modeled to a considerable extent upon 
the Biblical English of Wyclif, although obsolete words 
are but sparingly used. The apparatus of introduction, 
notes, and appendices supplies the beginner with the 
essentials, and the book as a whole may be said to ac- 
complish its modest purpose in a very satisfactory 
manner. 

Many poets miss their proper audience for being too 
voluminous or too widely dispersed in unrelated tomes. 
No greater service can be done for such a poet than the 
preparation of a careful and choice selection from his 
various books the service done, for example, by Ar- 
nold for Byron, by Mr. Stopford Brooke for Shelley, 
by Professor Woodberry for Mr. Aubrey De Vere, or 
by Mr. Swinburne for himself. An exquisite example 
of this sort of service is afforded by Mrs. Meynell's se- 
lection of examples from the poems of Mr. Coventry 
Patmore. " Poems of Pathos and Delight " the book 
is called, and is a book of delight in more senses than 
one. Mrs. Meynell's preface is brief but adequate, the 
comment of one true poet upon the work of another. 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish the volume in this 
country. 

Miss Lily Lewis" Rood"is~the~authorl)f a brochure 
sketch of M. Pavis de Chavannes, her treatment being 
sketchy but sympathetic, anecdotal and mildly crit-

hand-made paper by Messrs. L. Prang & Co. There 
are several illustrations, including a portrait of the ar- 
tist and the decorative printing for the Boston Public 
Library. 

We noticed Dr. Tracy's " Psychology ofl^Wdhood'' 
when it first appeared, expressing the opinion, which we 
see no reason for retracting or modifying, that it is one 
of the best studies of the child that American students 
have produced. The new edition (Heath), which is 
much improved in its mechanical form, presents no new 
features calling for comment. The bibliography, which 
is one of the best features of the book, has been brought 
up to date, embracing 105 titles. 



" Eugenie Grandet," translated by Miss Ellen Mar- 
riage, is the latest volume of the Macinillan edition of 
Balzac. " The Fortunate Mistress " fills two volumes, 
numbered twelve and thirteen, in the Dent edition of 
Defoe, which Mr. Aitkin is editing so acceptably. In 
the Lippincott edition of Smollett, we have, also in two 
volumes, a reprint of " The Adventures of Count 
Fathom." The Lyric Poems of Sir Philip Sidney," 
edited by Mr. Ernest Rhys, is the newest volume in 
this charming Dent series of " The Lyric Poets." All 
of these books are manufactured in a highly tasteful 
manner. 

The edition of Scheffel's " Ekkehard " just published 
by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. is one of the prettiest 
things of the season, and one for which lovers of the 
best literature should be unusually grateful. Of the 
work itself, we need not speak; it is simply one of the 
greatest historical novels ever written. This edition is 
in two volumes, with some charming illustrations, and 
all the notes of the latest German edition. The trans- 
lation is an old one, revised by Mr. Nathan Haskell 
Dole, who also contributes a highly readable introduc- 
tory account of the author. 

" My Double, and How He Undid Me," by the Rev. 
Edward Everett Hale, is almost as well established 
among our short-story classics as " The Man without a 
Country " itself. Messrs. Lamson, Wolffe & Co. have 
just made of it a very pretty booklet, tastefully old- 
fashioned in get-up, and including both a portrait of 
the author and a preface written especially for this edi- 
tion. We note that Dr. Hale promises a new story, to 
be entitled " A Man without a City," to be brought out 
by the same publishers. 

Messrs. Way & Williams publish a charming reprint 
of Shelley's translation of the " Banquet " of Plato, with 
decorative initials and title-page by Mr. Bruce Rogers. A 
heavy-faced type, a well-proportioned page, and a taste- 
ful buckram cover, are the chief mechanical features of 
this edition of this little classic, which will be highly 
prized by lovers of Plato and of Shelley alike. As one 
of the two most characteristic examples of Shelley's 
prose, it was well worthy of this separate publication. 

A collection of fifty original charades has been pub- 
lished by the members of St. Agnes Society, Ogdeus- 
burg, N. Y., in a dainty little volume entitled " Guess 
Again." The charades are for the most part very good, 
and the book can be cordially recommended to those 

who are interested in this form of entertainment In 

this connection we may mention a similar volume con- 
taining over a hundred original charades by Mr. Her- 
bert Ingalls, entitled " The Boston Charades," and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Lee & Shepard. 

" Poets' Dogs " is the latest of the anthologies, and 
is edited by Miss Elizabeth Richardson (Putnam). The 
idea of the book seems amusing at first, but is amply 
justified when we examine the selections, which range 
from the " Odyssey " to " Geist's Grave " and " Owd 
Roa." On the cover is stamped as a quaint device " The 
little dogs and all." 

The Macmillan miniature edition of Tennyson now 
includes volumes headed, respectively, by "Locksley 
Hall " and " A Dream of Fair Women," each booklet 
containing besides a group of poems chronologically as- 
sociated with the titular pieces.

scientific thought and investigation. Dalton, Rennell, 
and Maxwell have already found treatment in this ad- 
mirable series, and we now have volumes on Liebig, 
Lyell, and the Herschels. Mr. W. A. Shenstone is the 
author of the first, Professor T. G. Bonney of the second, 
and Miss Agnes M. Clerke of the third of these satis- 
factory books. Faraday, Davy, Pasteur, Darwin, and 
Helmholtz are soon to appear in the series. Of a still 
more popular sort is the science contained in Sir Robert 
Ball's " Great Astronomers " (Lippincott), which gives 
us about a score of sketches from Ptolemy to Adams, 
the whole beautifully illustrated. 

The " Mermaid " series of old English dramatists, 
having rounded its first full score of volumes, enters 
upon what we hope may become a second score with a 
selection from Chapman, edited by Mr. M. L. Phelps. 
Selection was an easy matter in this case, for in no other 
Elizabethan dramatist is the distinction between good 
and inferior work so marked as it is with Chapman. 
The volume contains " All Fools " the two Bussy d'Am- 
bois plays, and the two Byron plays, a selection that 
way nothing less than inevitable. Mr. Phelps writes a 
scholarly introduction, but makes a lower estimate of 
the value of Chapman's work than we are disposed to 
accept. Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Lowell came much 
nearer justice, in our opinion, than does the present 
editor. (Imported by Scribner.) 

The Cambridge Edition " of " The Complete Poet- 
ical Works of Oliver Wendell Holmes " (Houghton) is 
similar in all mechanical respects to the " Cambridge " 
Longfellow, Whittier, and Browning, except for the 
lesser mimber of pages and the consequently thicker 
paper. There is an etched portrait, a biography by Mr. 
Scudder, with notes and indexes. We have so often 
before praised these editions that we need now do no 
more than refer to what we have said of the earlier vol- 
Times of the series. Few books accomplish their pur- 
pose as completely as these, or are so satisfactory in 
every way. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. send us a new and very attractive 
school edition of Messrs. Greenough and Kittredge's 
" ^neid," Books I. to VI. The illustrations are par- 
ticularly well-chosen and interesting, while the notes 
include many references to parallel passages in English 
poetry. From the same publishers we have a little vol- 
ume of " Selected Lives from Cornelius Nepos," edited 
by Dr. Arthur W. Roberts. Dr. W. B. Owen has 
edited for Messrs. Leach, Shewell & Sanborn the first 
book of Cicero's " De Oratore," making a neat and 
useful text-book. While on the subject of Cicero, we 
may also mention Dr. W. Peterson's translation, with 
notes, of the speech in defence of Cluentius. (Mac- 
millan.) 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish "A German Reader 
for Beginners," by Professor Charles Harris. The se- 
lections are grouped according to their difficulty, and 
include several lengthy pieces. A vocabulary permits 
this book to be used without the aid of the dictionary. 
From the American Book Co. we have an edition of 
Stifter's "Das Heidedorf," edited by Mr. Max Lentz; 
and a volume of "Bilder aus der Deutschen Litera- 
tur," by Professor J. Keller. The latter work is an 
elementary history, with selections. We may also 
note in this connection the " Three German Tales " 
(from Goethe, Zschokke, and Kleist), edited by Mr. A. 
B. Nichols (Holt); and Dr. Max Poll's edition of 
"Emilia Galotti" (Ginn). Each of these books has an 
introduction and notes. 



The Lady of the Lake," edited by Dr. Homer B. 
Sprague; "The Vicar of Wakefield," under the same 
editorial supervision ; and " Select Minor Poems of 
John Milton," edited by Mr. James E. Thomas, are 
three recent additions to the " Studies in English Clas- 
sics " of Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. Messrs. May- 
nard, Merrill & Co. send us, in their " English Classic " 
series, More's " Utopia," and a selection from Lamb's 
essays, both anonymously edited, and hence open to 
suspicion. A far better book than any of these is Pro- 
fessor O. F. Emerson's edition of " Rasselas," published 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

Two school editions of Cicero's " De Senectute " have 
just come to us. One, by Professor Frank E. Rockwood, 
is published by the American Book Co.; the other, edited 
by Mr. E. S. Shuckburgh and Dr. James C. Egbert, 
is a volume in the " Elementary Classics " series of 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co. Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish, 
in their " College Series of Greek Authors," " Eight 
Orations of Lysias," edited by Dr. Morris H. Morgan. 
We may also mention, in this connection, Mr. John H. 
Huddilston's " Essentials of New Testament Greek," 
published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

Professor Ralph M. Tarr's "Elementary Physical 
Geography " (Macmillan) is a book so attractive in ap- 
pearance, and so modern in method, that it should make 
instant appeal to the progressive educator. For one 
thing, it is a book like other books not the ungainly 
and unwieldy quarto of which most children think when 
the word "geography" is mentioned. Much is gained 
by the octavo form, and little or nothing lost. Physical 
maps, fortunately, do not need the acreage of paper de- 
manded by maps of the ordinary sort. It is hard to find 
a place for physical geography in the school curriculum; 
the high school does not want it, and the grammar school 
is not up to it. Such a book as Professor Tarr's, at any 
rate, is distinctly a manual for the secondary school. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

New editions of Mr. L. B. Seeley's " Horace Walpole 
and His World " and " Fanny Burney and Her Friends " 
are among the latest importations of Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

" La Recherche de 1'Absolu," translated by Miss Mar- 
riage, with a preface by Mr. Saintsbury, is the latest 
addition to the acceptable Dent-Macmillan edition of 
Balzac in English. 

Messrs. Putnam's Sons publish in their pretty leather- 
covered " Fly Leaves " series Thackeray's " Novels by 
Eminent Hands," and "The Echo Club" by Bayard 
Taylor, with a prologue by Mr. R. H. Stoddard. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole has translated half a dozen 
short tales from the Italian of Signor Giovanni Vergo, 
and published them through the Joseph Knight Co. in a 
neat volume. " Under the Shadow of Etna " is the title. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have just published a 
selection from the poems of Mr. Austin Dobson, with 
illustrations by Mr. Hugh Thomson. " The Story of 
Rosina and Other Verses " is the title of this charm- 
ing volume. 

" The Proverbial Philosophy of Confucius " is a year- 
book from the Chinese classics, compiled by Mr. F. H. 
Jennings, and prefaced by the Hon. Pom Kwang Soh, 
Korean Minister of Justice. Messrs. Putnams are the 
publishers.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



A reader of THE DIAL wishes to find a short poem, 
published some years ago, based on the farewell of 
Andromache (JSneid, Book III.), of which he can re- 
call but one line : " Her grief is more than I can bear." 
Can anyone identify the poem from this fragment ? 

The concluding volumes of the charming Aitken- 
Dent edition of Defoe (Macmillan) will include the rare 
" Due Preparations for the Plague," and a number of 
pamphlets relating to Captain Avery, Jack Sheppard, 
Jonathan Wild, and other pirates and robbers, now re- 
printed for the first time. 

Messrs. Scribner's Sons' popular " Thistle Edition " 
of Stevenson's works is now completed, the final volume 
(the sixteenth) being devoted entirely to poetry. This 
edition is distinguished by some forty new poems 
(seventy pages), written principally during Stevenson's 
life in the South Seas, from 1888 to 1894. 

The " Extension Bulletins " of the University of the 
State of New York are doing valuable work as adjuncts 
to popular education. The latest issues (October and 
November) are devoted, respectively, to " Study Clubs " 
and " Extension of University Teaching in England and 
America." The latter work is by Dr. James E. Rus- 
sell, of the University of Colorado. 

" Stepniak," the Russian revolutionist, was run over 
by a railway train near London, on the 23d of Decem- 
ber, and instantly killed. His real name was never 
divulged to the English public, and the current news- 
paper statements that it was Dragornanoff are without 
foundation. "Stepniak" visited Chicago about four 
years ago, and gave a lecture before the Twentieth Cen- 
tury Club. He was a forcible writer and speaker, and 
the command of English displayed in his books is re- 
markable. 

The new international magazine, " Cosmopolis," the 
first number of which is to appear in January, will deal 
with the literature, politics, and drama of England, 
France, and Germany. Each writer will use his own 
language, and his remarks will be confined to his sub- 
ject in so far as it affects the country which he repre- 
sents. On the English side, Mr. Andrew Lang has 
promised to contribute the literary, Mr. Henry Nor- 
man the political, and Mr. A. B. Walkley the dramatic 
material. Mr. Fisher Unwin is the English publisher 
of the magazine. 

That genial and wholesome family journal, " The 
Outlook," announces that hereafter one of its issues 
every month will be a " magazine number " that is, 
will be enlarged, abundantly illustrated, and otherwise 
made more like a monthly magazine than a weekly 
paper. A series of papers on " The Higher Life of 
American Cities " is promised as one feature of these 
" magazine numbers." Dr. Albert Shaw will write of 
New York, Mr. Melville Stone of Chicago, Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale of Boston, Mr. Talcott Williams of Phil- 
adelphia, Miss Grace King of New Orleans, and the 
Rev. John Snyder of St. Louis. 

A Paris correspondent gives these interesting particu- 
lars regarding the library of the late Ernest Renan: 
"The complete catalogue of Renan's library has just 
been published. It will be well to add it to the writer's 
own works, for it is the bibliography of what he accom- 
plished. Renan was not a bibliophile, and doubtless he 
took comparatively little interest in the form of a work. 
Books were for him above all tools. In turning over 
the leaves of his catalogue you enter really into the 
laboratory where all his life long he pursued unremit- 



tingly his scientific work, without rest, without discour- 
agement, with an imperturbable faith, the faith of his 
youth in the future of science. The Oriental and Bib- 
lical collection is incomparably rich. It includes more 
than three thousand works. There are to be found all 
the books, reviews, and pamphlets which he consulted 
for his exegetical, philological, archseological, and his- 
torical studies. These books Renan loved as the com- 
panions of his great labors. He often expressed the 
hope that after his death they would not be dispersed. 
It is his family's wish that that desire should be ful- 
filled. They would like to dispose of the library as a 
whole, or at least not to let the richest portion of it 
namely, the Oriental collection be sold by auction." 



MR. WATSON'S SONNET TO AMERICA. 

towering daughter, Titan of the West, 
Behind a thousand leagues of foam secure, 
Thou toward whom our inmost heart is pure 

Of all intent, although thou threatenest 

With most unfilial hand thy mother's breast, 
Not for one breathing space may earth endure 
The thought of war's intolerable cure 

For such vague pains as vex to-day thy rest. 

But if thou hast more strength than thou canst spend 
In tasks of peace, and find'st her yoke too tame, 

Help us to smite the cruel, and befriend 
The succorless, and put the false to shame : 
So shall the ages laud thee, and thy name 

Be lovely among nations to the end.

The Literary World of October 5 

says : 

" We are deeply impressed from 
month to month with the value of the 
REVIEW OF REVIEWS, which is a sort 
of Eiffel Tower for the survey of the 
whole field of periodical literature. 
And yet it has a mind and voice of 
its own, and speaks out with decision 
and sense on all public topics of the 
hour. It is a singular combination of 
the monthly magazine and the daily 
newspaper. It is daily in its fresh- 
ness; it is monthly in its method. It 
is the world under a field-glass. If 
we were the teacher of a school we 
should use the ' Review of Reviews ' 
as a reader, and so make it do duty 
as an illustrated text-book in current 
history." 



The only way to describe adequately the REVIEW OF 
REVIEWS is to put several copies into your hands ; for 
it is so entirely different from all other magazines that 
one cannot form an idea of its timely interest and com- 
prehensive value without reading it. 

The RE VIE W OF RE VIE WS, as its name implies, gives 
in readable form the gist of the best articles in the other 
magazines all over the world, generally on the same date 
that they are published. With the recent extraordinary 
increase of worthy periodicals, these careful reviews, sum- 
maries, and quotations, containing the kernel of period- 
ical literature, are alone worth the subscription price. 

Aside from these departments, the editorial and con- 
tributed features of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS are 
themselves equal in extent to a magazine. The Editor's 
" Progress of the World " is an invaluable chronicle of 
the happenings of the thirty days just past, with pictures 
of the men and women who have made the history of the 
month on every page. 

The brilliant character sketches, fully illustrated, of 
such notable personalities in every country and sphere 
of action as Pope Leo, the Czar of Russia, Mr. Gladstone, 
Thomas Edison, whoever is for the month most spe- 
cially prominent, are of absorbing interest. 

If anything really notable occurs in the economic, 
political, or literary world, the reader of the REVIEW 
OF REVIEWS will find it discussed immediately not 
after waiting two months by the writer best fitted to 
do so. 

Thousands of letters prompted by an introduction to 
the REVIEW OF REVIEWS, often from celebrated, and 
always from discerning people, have been merely varia- 
tions on the themes, "the magazine is indispensable, " 
"the REVIEW OF RE VIEWS is invaluable," "no Amer- 
ican citizen should be without it," "it is a liberal educa- 
tion," etc., etc.

GRAND WINTER CRUISES 

BY THE MAGNIFICENT 

TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS 

OF THE 

HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE. 

FOR several years past the Hamburg- American Line has arranged cruises at certain seasons, 
placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces, and affording them all 
the comforts and luxuries of modern life. These cruises have become so popular with the 
American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service. 

THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin -Screw Express Steamer FURST BISMARCK, 
Captain Albers, sailing from New York January 28, 1896, to MADEIRA, the MED- 
ITERRANEAN, and the ORIENT. 

Touching at Madeira, Gibraltar, Algiers, Genoa, Villefranche (Nice), Tunis, Alexandria (Cairo 
and Pyramids), Jaffa (Jerusalem), Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Malta, Messina, Palermo, Naples, 
Genoa, and return to New York. 

The cruise from New York to the Orient and return to New York will occupy about ten weeks. Pas- 
sengers desiring to prolong their stay in Europe before returning to America may leave the excursion 
upon touching at Genoa the second time and take any one of the Hamburg- American Line's Express 
Steamers from Hamburg, Southampton, or Cherbourg, to New York, up to August 1, 1896. 

Ever since the childhood of the human race the Mediterranean coasts have played the most important 
part in the history of advancing civilization. Greece has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and 
poetry, Rome has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft, Egypt has filled our 
souls with thrills of awe and wonderment, the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig- 
ious fervor. All along the blue Mediterranean Sea we find the indelible imprints of man's past, the glo- 
rious monuments of antiquity. The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes, not in artistic 
reproduction, but in all its realistic grandeur and glory. The memories of such a trip, the sights of the 
scenery of the most remarkable events of man's history, will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every 
beholder. 

THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin-Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA, Cap- 
tain Vogelgesang, sailing from New York January 25, 1896, to the WEST INDIES 
and the SPANISH MAIN. 

The Itinerary will be: From New York and Old Point Comfort to Port au Prince (Hayti), May- 
aguez (Porto Rico), St. Thomas, St. Kitts, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, 
Trinidad, La Guayra (for Caracas) and Puerto Cabello ( Venezuela), Kingston (Jamaica), Havana, 
Key West, Old Point Comfort, and New York. 

This tour lasts about four and a half weeks, and offers American tourists a most attractive and com- 
fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters. 

A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure, recalling many a famous 
exploit of dead-and-gone worthies. But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely 
palm-covered beaches, of beautiful scenery and strange peoples, offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible 
fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses. In cruising from port to port in these en- 
chanted seas, among verdant and flower-clothed islands, nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful 
mood, and life in the tropics at its best. It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine any attribute of an 
ideal winter resort not found among these " Fortunate Isles." 

CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE. 



TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST.

" The TSest ^American tffovel of the Year." 

THE RED REPUBLIC. 

A Romance of the Commune. By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS, author of The King in Yellow," In the 
Quarter," etc., etc. 12mo, ornamental cover, $1.25. 

" ' The Red Republic ' stands head and shoulders above any American novel of the year. There are in it wonderfully 
impressive pictures of the days of the Commune. I know of no book fiction or history in which the savage cruelty of the 
mob, the pitilessness of irresponsible power, the pathos of headless armies marching to death, are so vividly described. It has 
blood and it has viscera. And the thing lives." Commercial Advertiser. 

"Mr. Chambers showed in ' The King in Yellow ' that he had the clue to the secret. This work shows that he is nearer 
that secret now. He has already earned a place among the men of whom things are ' expected,' and he can do what few men 
can do he can tell a story." JAMES L. FORD in New York Journal. 

" Why is the book so good, and so difficult to lay down unfinished ? " New York Recorder. 

" By far the most notable book of the week. Last season American letters were enriched by two very original and very 
remarkable books, viz., ' Chimmie Fadden' and ' The King in Yellow.' ' The Red Republic' is, I think, the one sort of his- 
torical novel which has a chance of living very far into the next century. ... A wonderfully real and intensely vital picture of 
the Commune. There is in the book a fine quality of romance which carries you along to the last page in a pleasurable state 
of excitement. ... A book that will hold your attention from the first page to the last. ... I do not think one need hesi- 
tate to call ' The Red Republic ' the best American novel of the year." VANCE THOMPSON.

THE SCHOLAR AND HIS FUNCTION 
IN SOCIETY. 

In the last issue of THE DIAL an urgent plea 
was made for serious thought and sober judg- 
ment in the matter of the grave international 
complication with which we were suddenly con- 
fronted at the approach of Christmas-tide, and 
which seemed to evoke in many quarters a spirit 
of recklessness creditable neither to our mor- 
ality nor our intelligence as a nation. With- 



out attempting to discuss the political questions 
concerned, we emphasized the need of delibera- 
tion in all such matters, and stated as our posi- 
tion that in a dispute involving, as the Vene- 
zuelan controversy does, delicate questions of 
international usage and historical investiga- 
tions such as only the well-equipped scholar 
can undertake, it was the part of sobriety and 
self-respect to maintain a decent reserve, await- 
ing the final verdict of the trained specialist, 
and provisionally deferring to the judgment of 
those alone whose authority can have any real 
weight. Our modest " plea for sanity " has 
called forth a number of communications, most 
of them in sympathy with the attitude of THE 
DIAL, but a few breathing the "amazement 
and indignation " aroused in patriotic breasts 
by our tame and spiritless views. 

We are not concerned to reply to these angry 
outpourings, for they are all beside the mark. 
Those that make elaborate arguments about 
the boundary line of Venezuela discuss a sub- 
ject upon which we have expressed no opinion, 
and in which we take but a feeble interest. 
Those that denounce our utterances as " trea- 
sonable " and " unpatriotic " have yet to learn 
the meaning of the words " fidelity " and " pa- 
triotism." " Our true country," as Lowell once 
wrote, " is that ideal realm which we represent 
to ourselves under the names of religion, duty, 
and the like. Our terrestrial organizations are 
but far-off approaches to so fair a model, and 
all they are verily traitors who resist not any 
attempt to divert them from this their original 
intendment." We are happy to note that the 
opening weeks of the new year have brought 
much testimony to the existence among our 
fellow-countrymen of a nobler patriotic passion 
than is known to the philosophy of the jingo, 
and that hundreds of weighty utterances have 
voiced the sentiments of justice and humanity 
and civilization, justifying our appeal almost 
before it was made. 

There is, however, one aspect of the recent 
discussion, as of most public discussions in 
which fundamental principles are concerned, 
that seems to call for thoughtful consideration. 
The greatest fault of democracy is that it so 
often presumes to decide upon questions which 
in their very nature are to be decided upon 
intelligently only by experts. Every philosoph- 



38 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



ical writer upon democratic institutions, whether 
sympathizing with them or not, has put his 
finger upon this weak spot, and found in it the 
greatest menace to the permanence of popular 
government. A sound decision upon almost 
any problem of political science, of economics 
or finance, is within the reach of specially dis- 
ciplined minds alone, and the opinion of the 
unthinking masses upon such matters has just 
as much or as little real weight as an opinion 
upon the special problems of engineering, or 
chemistry, or physiology. This doctrine, of 
course, will never receive the assent of the dem- 
agogue, whether he be a political schemer, or a 
legislator chosen by popular vote, or the editor 
of a newspaper conducted upon modern com- 
mercial principles. It is the business of all 
these people to pretend that their opinions 
upon the delicate problems presented by the art 
of government are as good as anybody's, and 
probably a little better ; their stock in trade is 
an infinite self-assurance, and their method the 
method of flattery, either rank or insidious, 
according to the particular vanities or suscep- 
tibilities of their hearers. 

For many years these artful manipulators of 
public opinion, in pursuit of their ad captan- 
dum policy, have sedulously labored to devel- 
op the antagonism always latent between the 
masses and the men of scholarship. The pro- 
cess is by no means peculiar to this country, 
but has probably been more successfully car- 
ried out with us than elsewhere, in consequence 
of the innate irreverence of the American na- 
tional character, its unpleasant self-assertive- 
ness, and the superficiality of the educational 
influences under which it has in large part been 
shaped. A curiously mythical notion of the 
scholar and his function in society, as unlike 
the reality as anything that could well be im- 
agined, has come currently to be held, and in 
perfect good faith, by a large proportion of our 
population. One can hardly take up an Amer- 
ican newspaper without coming upon many a 
covert sneer at the scholar and his modes of 
thinking, upon many an expression of ill con- 
cealed contempt for his impracticability and 
his idealism. He is spoken of as if he were 
some curious sort of stuffed animal, exhib- 
ited in the glass case of some university or 
other institution of learning. That he has 
opinions upon the subject to which he has de- 
voted a lifetime of thought is, of course, a fa- 
miliar fact, for he sometimes has the temerity 
to state them in public ; but that they should 
be taken seriously by the plain sensible man of 



affairs, who lives in the world and rubs against 
it every day, is too extraordinary a proposition 
to be considered. 

This singular distortion of view has received 
so frequent illustration of late years that ex- 
amples seem hardly necessary. The history of 
our national economic and financial policy since 
the Civil War is an almost unbroken record of 
fatuous ignorance, and empirical experimenta- 
tion, and insolent disregard of the best estab- 
lished inductions of science. The only ade- 
quate analogy is that offered by a man who 
barely escapes with his life from a succession 
of diseases, each the result of some act of reck- 
lessness, and each dealt with in accordance with 
the rules of some new quackery or some time- 
honored superstition. That there is such a 
thing as the scientific treatment of disease, and 
that imminent disease may be averted by the 
precautions suggested by scientific knowledge, 
are the last propositions that such a man will 
admit. And the body politic seems to fare in 
much the same way, for your Demos is firm in 
his prejudices, and distrusts above all things 
else the pedantry of the university professor 
or other variety of trained practitioner. " What 
can he know about politics ? " some one said 
of Lowell, a few years before the death of our 
great American scholar ; " he never made a 
stump speech in his life." " What can he know 
about the tariff ? " says the self-confident wool- 
grower of the authoritative writer upon eco- 
nomic science ; " he never raised a flock of 
sheep in his life." 

The application of these illustrations to the 
Venezuelan controversy is obvious enough. 
That controversy presents leaving its ethics 
out of the question two special problems, one 
of international law and one of statesmanship. 
The first problem is concerned with the rela- 
tion of the Monroe Doctrine to the body of in- 
ternational law and usage, together with the 
question of the legitimacy of an application of 
that Doctrine to this particular case. The sec- 
ond problem is concerned with the possible 
menace to our national safety resulting from a 
slight enlargement of a small English colony 
in a corner of South America. Both of these 
problems belong preeminently to the domain 
of the scholar, and upon neither of them is the 
opinion of the " man in the street " likely to 
have any value. Now the judgment of com- 
petent authorities upon both of these problems, 
in this country as well as in Europe, is sub- 
stantially unanimous as far as the essential ele- 
ments are concerned. That judgment runs 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



39 



counter to an opinion, or rather a sentiment, 
that seems to have a somewhat widespread 
currency among our population, a sentiment 
based mainly upon prejudices of the baser sort, 
and inflamed by the pernicious zeal of time- 
serving politicians and journalists. What 
should be the attitude of the sober-minded to- 
ward this division of opinion ? It seems to us 
that but one rational answer to such a question 
is possible. The voice of a man who has made 
the subjects concerned the study of his life- 
time, who can bring to bear upon the problems 
the full weight of historical scholarship and 
scientific method, must surely outweigh the 
voices of many thousands of butchers and 
bakers and candlestick-makers, however suc- 
cessfully they may ply their respective crafts. 
It is only where really competent opinion is 
divided, as in the case of the fierce discussion 
about acquired characteristics and heredity 
which just now divides the biologists into two 
opposed camps, that the layman is at all justi- 
fied in taking sides, and even in such a case a 
modest suspension of judgment is for him the 
more fitting part. " The majority is always 
wrong " is the vehement utterance of one of 
Dr. Ibsen's characters, reflecting, doubtless, 
the view of the dramatist himself in one of his 
moods of angry individualism. Without ac- 
cepting this as a complete induction, we may 
say that history shows the majority to have been 
often wrong, at least, and honors the minority 
that has stood for justice and right. And we 
may add that the minority, when it really is 
right, and stands patiently steadfast, nearly 
always in the end brings around to its own way 
of thinking the wrong-headed majority. 



THE STAGNATION IN RUSSIAN 
LITERATURE. 

The close connection between politics and letters, 
which has been a distinctive characteristic of the 
intellectual life of Russia, was never more strikingly 
illustrated than at the present time. The confusion, 
uncertainty, and haziness of the political situation 
are fully reflected in the literature of the country. 
The land which has produced Tourgue'nieff, Gogol, 
Dostoievsky, Saltikoff, and Tolstoi, is now without 
a single definite literary school or movement. Tol- 
stoi, to be sure, lives and writes. His latest novel, 
" Master and Man," whose success outside of Russia 
has not been very decided, has proved disappointing 
to the progressive youth of Russia. While every- 
thing Tolstoi publishes is eagerly read and widely 
discussed, the ideas which he represents are no longer 
dominant. There is little sympathy with the cult of 



individual self-improvement and altruism ; progress 
is generally expected to take the form of a change 
in the economic, political, and educational conditions 
of Russia. Tolstoi is indifferent to external reforms, 
and insists that character alone is essential. He 
exhorts individual men and women to be unselfish, 
brave, and truthful, and has no hope of improvement 
through any other agency. Nearly all his recent 
works, including " Master and Man," enforce this 
moral ; and hence most of his readers, while admit- 
ting the literary power and charm of his latter-day 
fiction, declare that Russia no longer finds in it that 
inspiration and that aid which Tolstoi afforded it 
in the days when his doctrines enjoyed considerable 
popularity. There is considerable interest in the 
new novel which Tolstoi is understood to have 
nearly ready for publication. It deals with the life 
of Siberian convicts, and shows that moral regen- 
eration is not imposssible even under the worst con- 
ditions, provided love in its most unselfish form is 
present to guide and comfort the victims. Accord- 
ing to reports in the Russian press, the heroine of 
the new novel is a young woman unjustly accused 
of having poisoned a rich merchant with whom she 
lived in illicit relations, while the hero is the foreman 
of the jury which convicts the woman. This fore- 
man falls in love with the supposed murderer, and 
follows her to Siberia. Whatever the artistic merits 
of this new story may prove to be, its " moral " will 
be essentially the same as that of " Master and 
Man," and it cannot be taken as expressing the 
present sentiments and aspirations of Russia. Tol- 
stoi is powerful, but he stands virtually alone. The 
progressive elements of Russia recognize his sin- 
cerity and moral greatness, but decline to follow 
him. He is not a leader of men, and his writings 
do not impel his readers to action along the lines 
indicated by him. 

The younger writers of fiction, having no special 
doctrine to preach, turn to actual life for their 
material, and find it colorless, vague, poor, unstable. 
Being, most of them, extremely realistic, their novels 
naturally reflect the emptiness and confusion of the 
life they depict. The most successful of them 
Mamin, Chekhoff, Korolenko, and others still 
continue to describe peasant life ; but a number 
have abandoned that field and turned their attention 
to the aristocratic classes and the high life of the 
capital. This departure is deemed very significant 
by the best Russian critics, for ever since the eman- 
cipation of the serfs the "Populist" movement in 
Russia has attracted the finest writers, and the life 
and labor of the people the peasantry and the city 
proletariat have furnished the themes for their 
productions. This literary movement has coincided 
and corresponded with the revolutionary Populist 
movement, which sent thousands of the most cul- 
tured and refined youths into the villages and fac- 
tories, to live and work with the common people for 
the sake of disseminating liberal political ideas 
among them and scattering the seeds of revolution. 
Now, however, the revolutionary movement is prac- 



40

[Jan. 16, 



tically dead in Russia. The young men and women 
no longer go among the people as propagandists 
and conspirators against the powers that be, while 
terrorism has been abandoned as wasteful and futile. 
The desire of the progressive minority to be useful 
to the masses is as intense as it has ever been, but 
the methods have radically changed. Literature 
has not as yet adapted itself to these new conditions, 
and it is at present colorless, barren, and vapid. 

The high hopes of the reformers having been 
dashed by the reactionary attitude of the Czar, con- 
stitutional and political changes, while still secretly 
yearned for, have ceased to form the staple of dis- 
cussion. But it would be an error to suppose that 
no improvements at all are expected in Russia. The 
present government is apparently determined to 
demonstrate that absolutism is not incompatible 
with true progress, and a number of important re- 
forms seem to have been decided upon. Perhaps 
the most important task undertaken by it is univer- 
sal popular education. There is a veritable educa- 
tional crusade in Russia at present. The Provincial 
Assemblies, the press, official and voluntary socie- 
ties, all talk about the means of raising the popular 
intelligence. Thousands of new schools are pro- 
posed for villages, night schools, libraries, lectures, 
and reading rooms are being organized in the cities, 
popular editions of national and foreign authors are 
being undertaken, and the young men and women 
of the country are turning their attention to this 
sphere of activity. Higher education is not neg- 
lected. A medical college for women has been au- 
thorized by the government, and several new com- 
mercial colleges have been opened for graduates of 
female gymnasia. A warm controversy has arisen 
in regard to the character of the proposed common 
schools. The Conservatives insist on religious train- 
ing and on the control of the schools by the clergy. 
They want none but priests as teachers, and plainly 
intimate that secular education would prove a source 
of the greatest danger to absolutism. Secular 
teachers, they say, would disseminate revolutionary 
heresies and undermine the foundations of Church 
and State. Moreover, mere intellectual training, 
instruction in the " three R's," they argue, will be 
of little utility either to the masses or to the govern- 
ment. Honesty, loyalty, sobriety, and strong prac- 
tical sense, are virtues entirely unrelated to the abil- 
ity to read and write, and the government ought not 
to encourage education that is not spiritual, moral, 
Christian. On the other hand, the Liberals naturally 
insist on complete separation between the schools 
and the Church, and they point to the tendencies in 
the civilized world at large as sustaining their view. 
The government has not interfered with this discus- 
sion, but it is feared that it will finally take the side 
of the Conservatives. 

Economic and judicial reforms are also among 
the probabilities of the near future. New land- 
banks for the pesantry are planned, and in certain 
Provincial Assemblies it is proposed to organize 
legal bureaus to which the peasants could apply for 



free advice. The monopoly of the sale of liquor, 
which the government has experimentally intro- 
duced in a few provinces, appears to have worked 
well, and the disappearance of all private saloons 
is regarded as a great reform by all Russian writers 
except the few who claim that the nobility, rather 
than the government, ought to enjoy this monopoly. 
In short, reform, though not of a political or con- 
stitutional nature, is in the air. People are in a 
state of expectancy. They are hopeful, and yet skep- 
tical. They believe that something will be done by 
the present government, and they are eager to lend 
a hand and cooperate in anything really conducive 
to national welfare ; at the same time, they fear that 
the reactionary spirit presiding over these reform- 
atory movements may emasculate and deflower the 
most promising of the reforms. 

Under these circumstances the literary life can 
hardly be very vigorous. Publicists and economists 
manage to extract some comfort from the dim pros- 
pects and possibilities of progress, but the lot of the 
novelists and story-tellers is hard indeed. The 
present is dismal and chaotic, and they are not even 
sure that they are on the eve of a new era. Real- 
ism has always been supreme in Russian fiction, but 
even realism needs definite human documents and 
an active life full of movement, interest, and strug- 
gle. Stagnation, indefiniteness, confusion, are fatal 
to it. All is talk at present in Russia ; there are 
no types or things worthy of study and portrayal. 
The Tourgue'nieff atmosphere has vanished ; the ter- 
rorist and revolutionary days are over ; the enthu- 
siasm of the Populist propogandists has spent itself. 
No one knows what the future will bring. Tolstoi 
alone, as said above, unconcerned and indifferent, 
with a firm faith in the saving quality of his phil- 
osophy of life, is able to write and preach in the 
form of semi-realistic fiction. He has his ideal, 
source of inspiration, and message, and he finds 
sermons in stones and lessons in everything.

UNAUTHORIZED EDITION OF MURRAY'S 

MYTHOLOGY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The literary notices of THE DIAL are so uniformly 
accurate and just that I read with some surprise, in the 
issue of December 16, your mention of the new edition 
of A. S. Murray's "Manual of Mythology"; one might 
readily infer from it tliEtt the book had been carefully 
revised by the author. In a recent letter Mr. Murray 
says: " Since the preparation of the second edition of the 
Manual, so long ago that I was but a young man then, 
I have had nothing whatever to do with the book in any 
shape or form." Moreover, the authorized publishers 
of the American edition are Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons ; on the conduct of the Philadelphia publisher who 
has taken Mr. Murray's book without authorization, and 
has had it revised without consulting him, each reader 
will pass judgment for himself. j\ W. K.

THE IJIFE AND TIMES OF CORREGGIO.* 

It has always seemed somewhat odd that a 
painter of Correggio's genius should have lived 
and worked in the centre of Italy, in the bright- 
est period of the Renaissance, without creating 
notice for himself or his art, outside of his local 
province, until long after his death. No con- 
temporary writer mentioned him ; Ariosto over- 
looked him ; Vasari could get little exact data 
about him, and had to write the first life of 
him from hearsay. In 1552 Landi said of 
him that he was " a painter nobly formed by 
nature herself rather than by any master," and 
Titian at Parma with Charles V. praised his 
Cathedral frescoes ; but the man's life was still 
unknown. Baldinucci added nothing to the 
Vasari biography but eulogy, and it was not 
until the eighteenth century that Tiraboschi 
published documentary evidence about the 
painter and tried to get at the facts of his 
life. In our century much has been written 
about him : Pungileoni published new docu- 
ments, Meyer sifted all the old material into 
new form, Morelli straightened out the attribu- 
tion of his pictures ; and now the director of 
the Parma gallery, Dr. Corradi Ricci, comes 
forward with more new documents in a large 
handsomely-illustrated folio which finally sums 
up all the recorded life of the painter. 

Students of history will take up Dr. Ricci's 
book with eagerness, and they may put it down 
with some shade of disappointment. It doubt- 
less contains all there is to be known about 
Correggio, but the gist of it was already known. 
And those "new documents" to which the 
writer has had access, and which were to throw 
new light upon the painter, are neither very 
important nor very illuminating. Dr. Ricci 
has written a sound critical and historical ac- 
count of Correggio the best yet published 
but it revolutionizes no old theories and estab- 
lishes no new point of view. It collects, cor- 
rects, amends, and in that way doubtless gets 
at the truth of matters ; for the writer seems to 
have no conception of Correggio that requires 
a distortion of probability. He gives the facts 
as they are known, and his inferences from them 
are neither far-fetched nor illogical. For this 
his readers will thank him. There is so much

Friends, and his Times. By Corrado Ricci. Translated from 
the Italian, by Florence Simmonds. New York : Imported 
by Charles Scribner's Sons. 



theory-forming and fact-straining in modern 
historical writing, that a plain common-sense 
statement is refreshing. 

The facts of Correggio's early life are practic- 
ally unknown, and this accounts for the " isolated 
genius " theory advanced by various writers. 
The absence of record was to them evidence 
enough that Correggio had neither teachers 
nor education, and that he sprang up suddenly, 
like a fountain in the desert, by virtue of in- 
herent force. Neither the tale of his childish 
ignorance nor that of his great learning has any 
basis in historic statement. He wrote a good 
hand and painted magnificent pictures : that is 
positively all we know about his learning. It 
is fair to suppose, however, that he could have 
done neither without some cultivated intelli- 
gence. He probably received the education of 
the youths of his time. His native town and 
province were quite as awake to the intelligence 
and learning of the Renaissance as other Ital- 
ian towns and provinces ; there was building, 
carving, and painting there as elsewhere in 
Italy, and the young Correggio was probably 
just as susceptible to the spirit of the age in the 
Emilia as the young Raphael in TJmbria. 

Correggio was born in 1494, of respectable 
but not rich or noble parents. His first mas- 
ter in painting was doubtless some local artist, 
like his uncle, or Antonio Bartolotti degli An- 
ceschi ; but this is not positively known. There 
is no record of his apprenticeship in art, save 
what shows in his early works. These are 
reminiscent of Ferrara and Bologna, but it can- 
not be inferred that he was a pupil of Fran- 
cesco Bianchi-Ferrari, or of Francia, or of 
Costa. His first important picture, painted 
when he was twenty, was the " Madonna of St. 
Francis," now in the Dresden gallery. In it 
one meets with many resemblances to well- 
known artists. Mantegna's " Madonna of Vic- 
tory," now in the Louvre, seems to have been 
studied by the young painter. The pose of the 
St. Francis Madonna, the outstretched hand, 
the black-and-white of the pedestal, the drapery, 
the foreshortening, the children, all indicate a 
study of the great Paduan. Yet Mantegna died 
when Correggio was twelve years of age ; he 
could not have been the latter's master. The 
young Correggio was merely influenced by 
Mantegna's work. And other influences were 
evidently upon him at the same time. The St. 
Francis and the St. Catherine in the Dresden 
picture are strong reminders of Francia, and, 
though Dr. Ricci will not admit it, the picture 
shows the influence of Leonardo da Vinci. The

figure of John at the right belongs to the Lom- 
bard school of Leonardo. The Madonna's 
smile, the heavy eyelids, the oval face, the con- 
tours, the light-and-shade, are all borrowed 
from the same source ; and that foreshortened 
hand and arm may be seen in the " Madonna 
of the Eocks" in the Louvre, as well as in 
Mantegna's " Madonna of Victory." The Lom- 
bard tinge is again noticeable in Correggio's 
" Bolognini Madonna " at Milan, and in other 
early works. There is no record that Correg- 
gio ever was in Milan or ever saw Leonardo. 
It is highly probable, however, that he had seen 
and studied some Lombard pictures ; for dur- 
ing his youth Parma was at one time subject 
to Milan, and Milanese painters had been there 
yes, Leonardo himself for a brief visit. 

The study of Correggio's masters and early 
influences ends where it begins, in conjecture. 
Like most young painters, he probably swung 
here and there until he found his own mind 
and path. He was not a life-long assimilator 
like Raphael, but a man of peculiar individ- 
uality, who always remained Emilian in art, 
though at first swayed by the great men of the 
times. It was natural that he should admire 
Leonardo, Francia, Costa, Dosso, and Man- 
tegna ; and that he followed the last-named in 
his frescoes for the Convent of S. Paolo at 
Parma, there can be little doubt. These fres- 
coes were done in 1518, and Correggio was at 
that time living in Parma. In 1519 he re- 
turned for a year to his native town of Correg- 
gio, and then came back to Parma to do the 
frescoes of S. Giovanni Evangelista, at the re- 
quest of the Benedictines. The fresco in the 
dome of this church marks something of a de- 
parture not only in Correggio's life but in Ital- 
ian art. It had been the practice in the com- 
position of large spaces to cut up the area into 
squares, triangles, and architectural niches, 
and to fill these with separate pictures ; but Cor- 
reggio invented a composition of colossal pro- 
portions, and threw the whole dome into one 
picture, showing Christ ascending in the cen- 
tre of the dome with the apostles and angels 
below him in a vast circle. And here in this 
fresco the grace of Correggio is as nothing to his 
strength. The figures of the apostles are almost 
like Michael Angelo's, so powerful are they in 
line and form, while that charm and sweetness 
so characteristic of his later altar-pieces are 
hardly noticeable. 

It was in 1520 that Correggio's marriage 
took place, and about this time that he painted 
the "Marriage of St. Catharine," the "Ma- 



donna della Cesta," and the " Descent from the 
Cross." In 1523 he began painting the fres- 
coes of the Parma Cathedral, and these occu- 
pied him until his death. He completed the 
great fresco in the cupola, and it seemed to 
receive almost instant recognition from his 
townspeople. Vasari was the first outsider to 
write about it, Correggio's immediate pupils 
(and after them the Carracci) copied it, Titian 
praised it, and still Correggio was only a 
local celebrity. For all Titian's praise, Venice 
did not know him ; for all Vasari's words, Flor- 
ence did not know him. Barocci, the later 
Bolognese, the Venetian Tiepolo, helped them- 
selves to the Parmese frescoes ; but it was not 
until the eighteenth century that Correggio 
really came to be ranked among the very great 
masters of Italy. 

Between 1524 and 1530, his large altar- 
pieces the three large ones at Dresden, the 
" St. Jerome," and the " Madonna della Sco- 
della " at Parma were painted. His technique 
at this time was so perfect that he could thor- 
oughly express his meaning, and all his joyous- 
ness and delight in physical life were poured out 
regardless of his religious subjects. Grace, 
charm, movement, rhythm of line and color, 
light-and-shade, all blended with splendid hand- 
ling to make great art. Correggio was at his 
height. His mythological pieces were done in 
the last years of his life, with the exception of 
the " Antiope " and the " Education of Cupid." 
Those years were destined to be few. His wife 
died in 1528, and after 1530 there is no trace 
of him at Parma. He was evidently at his na- 
tive town of Correggio, a few miles away, where 
he died March 5, 1534, aged forty years. 
There is no reason whatever to suppose that he 
died in poverty and neglect, as was formerly 
stated. In fact this latest biography makes it 
clear that he died wealthy and respected. 
Where his ashes repose, no one knows. They 
have his alleged body at Correggio, and his 
alleged skull is in the Academy at Modena ; 
but both relics are bogus the skull being that 
of an old woman instead of a young man. 

These outline facts are about all that is 
known of Correggio the man. Correggio the 
painter has been well and thoroughly studied 
in his works, and though Dr. Ricci's estimate 
of his genius and style is very good, it is not a 
novel estimate. Correggio was a painter of 
striking individuality, but his isolation from 
the leaders of the Renaissance did not neces- 
sarily produce his individuality ; he was simple, 
almost child-like, in his thought, having little

THE DIAL 



43 



care for the religious, the classic, or the intel- 
lectual ; but his alleged lack of education did 
not necessarily produce his simplicity. It was 
a part of his nature to regard all things for 
what they looked rather than for what they 
meant, and to see all things as form and color 
rather than as symbols of ideas. Nothing could 
have greatly changed that point of view. In 
a way, he was material and sensuous, given to 
form and color for their own sake, and to 
human beings for their humanity's sake. The 
problems of good and evil, of sin, death, and 
the hereafter, never concerned him. To live 
and be glad in the sunlight, to be simple, frank, 
natural, and graceful, apparently made up his 
sum of existence in art. He would have no 
solemnity, no austerity, no great intellectuality. 
Nothing tragic or mournful or pathetic inter- 
ested him. He was in love with physical life, 
and he told his love with all the sentiment of a 
lover. That he sometimes nearly precipitated 
sentiment into sentimentality, is true. He 
barely escaped it, and his followers were lost 
in it. It was the imitation of Correggio that 
produced the insipidities of painters like Carlo 
Dolci and Sassoferato. 

That Correggio, technically, should have 
been so perfect, living as he did shut off from 
Florence and Venice, is more remarkable than 
his peculiar mental attitude, since craftsman- 
ship is seldom well-taught if self-taught. Yet 
Correggio was somehow extremely well taught. 
His composition was occasionally involved and 
bewildering, but his drawing was nearly fault- 
less and his movement excellent. His light- 
and-shade has never been surpassed by any 
painter, ancient or modern, his color was rich 
and harmonious, his atmosphere omnipresent 
and enveloping, his brush-work sure and 
spirited. Indeed, it was the technique of his 
art, rather than the spirit of it, that first drew 
the attention of painters to his work, and they 
made it known to the world. 

Dr. Ricci has written a book that is the 
better for coming from a candid mind and a 
careful student. He has told us all there is to 
tell about Correggio, and that, too, in a concise 
and readable style. He might have followed 
ancient fables and made a more bulky biogra- 
phy, but it is matter for rejoicing that he has 
not done so. He has adhered to the records, 
and if he has found few new data about Cor- 
reggio it is all the more to his credit that he 
resisted the modern tendency to create hypo- 
theses and postulate them as proven fact.

LESSONS IN MUNICIPAL, GOVERNMENT.* 

Mr. Albert Shaw's valuable book on " Mu- 
nicipal Government in Great Britain " pre- 
pared us for a thorough piece of work in his 
handling of Continental European cities ; and 
in this expectation we are not disappointed. 
His solid volume of five hundred pages is clear 
and systematic in treatment and is packed with 
information. Porter's " Human Intellect " was 
said by a student of philosophy to be a book 
calculated to give one a headache at thought 
of the author's vast reading implied in it. Mr. 
Shaw's work in like manner is obviously the 
essence of countless reports and other inter- 
minable documents. But it is the essence. And 
it is illumined by a painstaking and loving 
study of this most modern of subjects in polit- 
ical science. 

The nine chapters form really a discussion 
of five related topics. The first two chapters 
nearly half the book are devoted to Paris 
and the French municipal system in general. 
This is taken as the type with which other sys- 
tems are to be compared. Municipal institu- 
tions in France were powerfully affected by the 
French Revolution, and early reached an ad- 
vanced development. The results have been 
very interesting and instructive, and it is 
largely from them that the impulse has been 
given to the rest of the continent. The third 
and fourth chapters relate to Belgium and Hol- 
land, Spain, and Italy. The next three cover 
the subject in Germany, and the last two in 
Austria and Hungary. Russian and Scandi- 
navian cities are not considered. 

The comprehensive nature of the work will 
be seen by a mere enumeration of the topics 
treated in discussing France. The author 
speaks of public order, streets, paving, light, 
transit, water, drainage, sanitation, bridges, 
schools, libraries, savings banks, and pawn- 
shops. He also analyzes the structure and work- 
ing of government by which all these services 
are administered. Some of the distinctive facts 
in the study of Paris are worthy of notice. 
One of them, and one that has an important 
bearing on the great development of that city, 
is the fact that Paris is the national capital. 
Hence the general government has a close re- 
lation to its civic life, as is the case, indeed, 
with the capital cities of most nations. Our 
own city of Washington is governed directly 
under the Congress of the United States, with

[Jan. 16 r 



little or no home-rule. The Paris police is man- 
aged by a department of the national adminis- 
tration. But that is also the system in Lon- 
don. And the recollection of the Commune of 
1871, to say nothing of previous insurrections, 
will make France hesitate long before entrust- 
ing the preservation of public order in Paris 
to local control. In the management of na- 
tural monopolies, such as gas and street tran- 
sit, the city follows methods which should make 
Americans begin thinking. No perpetual, or 
virtually perpetual, franchises are granted. All 
are subject to careful conditions, which include 
adequate compensation to the public treasury, 
specified services and prices, constant govern- 
mental supervision and control, and ultimate 
reversion of plants to public ownership. In 
many cases these services are owned and ad- 
ministered directly by the city. Public edu- 
cation, especially in technical lines, is exceed- 
ingly elaborate. There is no newspaper war 
on " fads " in Paris. It is recognized that 
taste, knowledge, and manual skill return their 
cost many fold. Accordingly, the most careful 
instruction is given in all forms of hand-work 
and in the fine arts. Manual training in the 
use of tools for boys, in needlework and the do- 
mestic arts for girls, in music and drawing for 
all, is given special attention. At the same time 
there are distinct trade-schools of many kinds, 
and high-schools of science, literature, classics, 
and engineering. 

The German system of local government is 
not radically different from the French. In 
each the fundamental part is the council. This 
is chosen by the people, and in turn selects the 
administrative staff. Of course Paris is an 
exception, as in that city the civic administra- 
tion is in the hands of the national government. 
And on the other hand, in Germany munici- 
pal suffrage, unlike the French and American 
systems, is usually limited to those possessed 
of some amount of property. The three-class 
system of Prussia, for instance, is simply this : 
Those who pay taxes on large amounts of prop- 
erty, amounting to one-third the whole, form 
the first class ; those who pay on the next third 
form the second class; the remainder of the 
tax-payers form the third class. Each class 
elects a third of the city council. Obviously, 
the number of voters in the third class greatly 
outnumbers those in both the others combined. 

In all the continental cities, Mr. Shaw finds 
efficiency, economy, and trained intelligence 
characterizing municipal administration. He 
finds the ward politics, which is so familiar to 



us, entirely wanting. He finds city administra- 
tion a profession the German cities calling a 
mayor from some other city, just as one of our 
universities would call a president. He finds 
corporate privileges dealt with primarily for 
the benefit of the municipality, and so most 
carefully hedged about with restrictions. He 
finds better paving, better sanitation, better 
care for education, better municipal bookkeep- 
ing, than in American cities. 

The Germania of Tacitus has been thought 
by some to have been a political tract, intended 
to show what Rome ought to be by painting 
some other country as possessing the virtues 
which Rome lacked. One is almost tempted 
to consider Mr. Shaw's optimistic picture of 
European cities as made on a similar plan. 
Nearly everything he depicts is something which 
we do in exactly the opposite way, and with 
just the opposite results. To be sure, we have 
great difficulties. Our cities grow very rapidly. 
But those of Germany, since 1871, have grown 
at the same rate. We have universal suffrage. 
But so has France. We have, it is true, a more 
heterogeneous population than European cities ; 
but that is not enough to account for our short- 
comings. And Americans cannot do better 
than to make themselves thoroughly familiar 
with Mr. Shaw's vivid exposition of how city 
government ought to be conducted, as seen in 
Europe. Almost any American city will show 
more or less plainly how it ought not to be done.

A GREATER BLACKSTONE.* 



Admiration and gratitude are the mental 
states that rise into consciousness when one 
inquires of himself what impressions have been 
made by perusal of the marvellous and monu- 
mental work on the sources of English law, 
" The History of English Law before the Time 
of Edward I." Seldom are analysis and criti- 
cism asked for on the results of investigations 
whose penetration and accuracy are vouched for 
by so distinguished and truth-compelling names 
as those of Sir Frederick Pollock and Profes- 
sor Maitland : the one, professor of jurispru- 
dence at Oxford ; the other, professor of the 
laws of England at Cambridge. Yet even with- 
out the generous avowal by the senior author,

in a brief prefatory remark, one would soon dis- 
cover that these stately volumes bear through- 
out the distinguishing characteristics of the 
learning and genius of the Downing Professor 
of Laws at Cambridge. And those who know 
Professor Maitland's work in other publica- 
tions will be glad that it is so, for they must 
all have long since recognized that for a most 
happy ability to combine the functions of inves- 
tigation and interpretation, he is without a peer 
in the field of political science. His painstak- 
ing and patient examination of original mate- 
rial, his dextrous insight, his calm and undog- 
matic judgment, may be found in other men ; 
his logical marshalling of the vast array of 
facts, in others ; and his lucid and fascinating 
manner and language, in others again ; but it 
is a rare combination which brings all these 
together in one man, and which has made Pro- 
fessor Maitland the master in his field. All 
these characteristics of his former work appear 
again in these his latest volumes, and prompt 
the reader to the wish, with which he leaves 
them, that this great scholar may live to give 
the world the history of later English law. 

The first two hundred pages of the work are 
devoted to a general sketch of the law for the 
period prior to 1272, under the headings Anglo- 
Saxon Law, Norman Law, the Age of Glan- 
vill, the Age of Bracton, and Roman and Canon 
Law. Eleven hundred pages more discuss the 
Doctrines of English Law in the Early Middle 
Ages, under the headings, Tenure, Sorts and 
Conditions of Men, Jurisdiction and the Com- 
munities of the Land, Ownership and Posses- 
sion, Contract, Inheritance, Family Law, Crime 
and Tort, and Procedure. This mere list of 
capital headings will show how admirably the 
whole subject is conceived of for presentation. 
The chapter on the age of Glanvill is rich in 
suggestion. Nowhere else is so clearly traced 
the growth of the jury system, from its sources 
in the Frankish inquisition, through the assizes 
of the reign of Henry II. No student who has 
painfully tried to work out these assizes in the 
pages of Stubbs but will be thankful for this 
simple exposition of the whole matter. It is, 
however, unfortunate that while the text is 
without flaw in its distinction of the great pro- 
prietary assize the Grand assize from the 
four possessory or petty assizes, the index fails 
one completely. There is no entry whatever 
under the title Proprietary Actions, although 
reference should certainly be made to I. 126- 
128, 333, II. 62-79, 136, 140. The same dis- 
tinction is worked out in the doctrinal portion 



of the treatise, under the head of Ownership 
and Possession, in the discussion of seisin and 
writs of entry. As an illustration of the felici- 
tous manner in which these archaic subjects are 
handled it may suffice to cite the following pas- 
sage in regard to the transition from assize to 
jury: 

" In a little time we have these four and only these 
four petty assizes. Only in these four instances does 
the writ, which is the first step in the procedure, the 
original writ, direct the empanelling of an inquest. Trial 
by jury, in the narrowest sense of that term, trial by jury 
as distinct from trial by an assize, slowly creeps in by 
another route. The principle from which it starts is 
simply this, that if in any action the litigants by their 
pleadings come to an issue of fact, they may agree to 
be bound by the verdict of a jury and will be bound 
accordingly. In course of time the judges will in effect 
drive litigants into such agreements by saying 'You 
must accept your opponent's offer of a jury or you will 
lose your cause'; but in theory the jury only comes in 
after both parties have consented to accept its verdict. 
An assize, other than a grand assize, is summoned by 
the original writ: it is summoned at the same time that 
the .defendant is summoned and before his story has 
been heard; a jury is not summoned until the litigants 
in their pleadings have agreed to take the testimony of 
the country ' about some matter of fact. In course of 
time the jury, which has its roots in the fertile ground 
of consent, will grow at the expense of the assize, which 
has sprung from the stony soil of ordinance; even an 
assisa when summoned will often be turned into a jury 
(yertilur injuratam) by the consent of the parties; but 
still trial by jury, if we use this term in a large sense, 
and neglect some technical details, is introduced by the 
ordinances of Henry II. as part of the usual machinery 
of civil justice." 

In the chapter on Bracton the growth of the 
system of royal courts is treated in the same 
suggestive manner, and one sees, as from a 
bird's-eye view, the branching off from the 
Curia Regis of Exchequer, Common Pleas, 
King's Bench, Chancery, Parliament, and Privy 
Council. Only in the matter of the earliest dis- 
tinction between Common Pleas and King's 
Bench is there failure to put it quite as clearly 
as Mr. Pike did six months earlier in his "Con- 
stitutional History of the House of Lords." 
The chapter on the canon law is very brief, but 
sheds much light. The influence of Roman law 
is shown to be partly by way of repulsion, 
partly by way of attraction. English lawyers 
were moved, not only to bring their own law 
abreast of the foreign rival by recourse to its 
native forces of progress, but also by imitation 
and incorporation of the stranger. Stress is 
laid upon the accident of a divergence of En- 
glish and continental law from one another, as 
the one shook off the Roman influences which 
the other accepted. 

The book abounds in new view-points for 



46

[Jan. 16, 



old ideas. Thus, the failure to discover the 
judicial trial by battle in Saxon England, as in 
other Germanic countries, is accounted for by 
the persistence of extra-judicial fighting. Only 
in those lands where a central power was strong 
enough to forbid the latter could the judicial 
duel have place, " thus combining the physical 
joy of battle with the intellectual luxury of 
strictly formal procedure." Scutage, which 
many think of as introduced in 1159, is prob- 
ably of much earlier date, and even under Ed- 
ward I. the tenant-in-chief who failed to attend 
would be rated, after the campaign ended, in 
a levy which included, not only the traditional 
scutage, but a heavy fine. It " seems clear 
that the tenant-in-chief 's duty of providing an 
armed force is not commuted into a duty of 
paying scutage." So, again, in the chapter on 
Tenure, it is shown in regard to alienation that 
" we must start not from the absolute inaliena- 
bility of ' the fief,' nor from the absolute alien- 
ability of * the fee simple,' but from ... an 
indeterminate right of the lord to prevent alien- 
ations which would seriously impair his inter- 
ests." The Gordian knot that has been tan- 
gled out of free men holding by unfree tenure 
is thus resolved, while we wonder that it was 
not done long ago. 

" The tenure is unfree, not because the tenant ' holds 
at the will of the lord ' in the sense of being removable 
at a moment's notice, but because his services, though 
in many respects minutely defined by custom, cannot be 
altogether denned without constant reference to the 
lord's will. . . . The man who on going to bed knows 
that he must spend the morrow in working for his lord, 
and does not know to what kind of work he may be put, 
though he may be legally a free man, free to fling up 
his tenement and go away, is in fact for the time being 
bound by his tenure to live the same life that is led by 
the great mass of unfree men ; custom sets many limits 
to his labours, custom sets many limits to theirs; the idea 
of abandoning his home never enters his head; the lord's 
will plays a large part in shaping his life." 

One finds in the discussion of the County, as 
is expected, a fuller presentation of the view 
of the suitors in the county court, first brought 
forward by Mr. Maitland in Volume III. of 
the " English Historical Eeview." This is, in 
brief, that attendance at court was a burden, 
and not a privilege, and that it fell, not on free- 
holders as such, but upon certain units of land, 
by no means equal in area. When this appor- 
tionment was made he does not pretend to say, 
although in the review article he guessed at the 
reign of Henry I., but he maintains his main 
thesis with force. 

So vast an achievement can be only touched 
in a review. The charm of the whole work 



lies in the absence of any dogmatism, and in 
the continual presentation of the variety and 
irregularity of mediaeval life. Here are no 
beautifully symmetrical theories to maintain, 
but only a careful collocation of an immense 
body of facts, and an attempt to discern in 
them the lines of movement toward the England 
of to-day. The work has been grandly done, 
once for all, we surmise, as to the substance of 
it, although new discoveries may alter details of 
the picture. The whole work is a great credit 
to the publishing houses that put it forth. Our 
only criticism is on the inadequate index, of 
which we have already spoken. Additional 
omissions noted are Droitural Actions, II., 
379 ; and as citations under topics already en- 
tered, Barns' Part, II., 375 ; Bastard, II., 373-

THE STORY OF THE "ALABAMA."* 



A surviving officer of the Confederate crui- 
ser " Alabama," Lieutenant Arthur Sinclair, 
has prepared, chiefly from his own recollec- 
tions, an account of the career of that famous 
vessel, and this is now published in a substan- 
tial illustrated volume of some three hundred 
and fifty pages. It is essentially a personal 
narrative, readable though not literate in style, 
good-tempered though one-sided ; yet, with its 
many faults, a distinct contribution to the per- 
manent literature of the Civil War. For it is 
the statement of an eye-witness of and active 
participant in some of the more stirring and 
memorable sea episodes of that eventful period. 

It is, of course, hardly to be expected that a 
strictly impartial statement of the " Alabama's " 
character and position, or of her adventures 
and achievements, should come from one of her 
own officers. Lieutenant Sinclair naturally 
believed in the vessel and in her mission ; and 
that is enough for the purposes of his narra- 
tive. It is told with an attractive frankness, 
and apparently with a desire to write fairly and 
truthfully as to disputed points. These, how- 
ever, appear but incidentally ; the chief por- 
tions of the work are given to an account of 
the vessel's career and to descriptions of life on 
board. 

The " Alabama " began her work of destruc-

tion in the summer of 1862. The Confederate 
cruisers had already, in their raids in the North 
Atlantic, demonstrated their capacity for mis- 
chief to the commerce of the United States, 
and it was decided to build larger and more 
formidable vessels and extend the field of their 
operation. In pursuance of this plan, secret 
agents of the Confederate government, acting 
as private purchasers, negotiated with the 
Lairds of Liverpool for the vessel which was 
first known as the " 290 " and soon became the 
** Alabama." She made her trial trip and es- 
cape from the Mersey barely in time to avoid 
detention, the agents of the United States hav- 
ing obtained evidence of her true character and 
laid the same before the British government. 
Sailing as a simple despatch boat, under the 
British flag and an English master, she soon 
reached her rendezvous at the Azores, where 
she was transferred to the command of Captain 
Semmes and his officers, and received her ar- 
mament and stores. The question of a crew 
became a pressing one, as the men on board 
had been shipped simply for a trip to the Azores, 
and were ignorant of the true character and 
purposes of the vessel. The test of their read- 
iness to enlist under the new flag was soon made. 
Our author thus describes the scene : 

" The officers are all in full uniform of an attractive 
shade of gray, with a redundancy of gold lace shock- 
ingly inappropriate to marine traditions. . . . The men 
are mustered aft to ' call ' of boatswain, and Semmes, 
mounting a gun-carriage, reads his commission from the 
President of the Confederate States as commander. 
. . . The ' stops ' to the halliards at the peak and main- 
mast head are broken, and the flag and pennant of the 
young nation float to the breeze. . . . Our Captain ad- 
dresses the men in a few curt but eloquent and persua- 
sive words, making known the character of the vessel and 
the purpose of the cruise. The paymaster has brought 
amidships his shipping list, and, like the rest of us, 
awaits the result of our gallant commander's speech. 
But the suspense is easing. One by one the groups dis- 
solve, and Jack, hat in hand, presents himself at the 
capstan and signs the articles, till eighty-five men have 
been secured." 

Thus began the memorable two-years cruise 
of the " Alabama," during which she sailed 
75,000 miles and visited almost every quarter 
of the globe the West Indies, Gulf of Mex- 
ico, Brazil, Cape of Good Hope, China Seas, 
Ceylon, Cape Town, and the English Channel, 
shifting rapidly from place to place so as to 
do the utmost damage and inspire the utmost 
terror by the unexpectedness of her attacks 
upon our merchant ships. She overhauled and 
examined several hundred vessels ; those be- 
longing to neutrals received an apology and 
went on their way, those having neutral cargo 



were released on ransom-bond, and those of the 
United States were plundered and burnt. There 
were fifty-seven of the latter, for which Great 
Britain paid, according to the terms of the 
Geneva award, $6,750,000. 

The author gives some very interesting pic- 
tures of life on shipboard, which decidedly 
lacked the monotony of the ordinary humdrum 
sea-life. The seamen all had double pay and 
a double allowance of daily grog, and seem to 
have been on the whole a hearty and efficient 
lot of fellows. Some good anecdotes are told 
of Semmes, the commander, who was usually 
referred to by the under officers as " Old Bees- 
wax " an appellation probably bestowed on 
account of his tenacity in holding fast to a 
chase. He had, it seems, a sardonic sort of 
humor, which often showed itself in a rather 
rough " guying " of the captured Yankee skip- 
pers who had vainly tried to outsail him. All 
the officers were, it appears, exceptionally fine 
and amiable men as mild-mannered, in fact, 
" as ever scuttled ship." It was the custom, 
on sighting a Yankee merchantman, to ap- 
proach under cover of the United States or 
English colors. If the prey became suspicious 
and attempted to escape, a blank shot, or, that 
failing, a solid one, usually brought her to. She 
was boarded, night or day, in all weathers ; the 
crew and available stores, and always the chro- 
nometer and flag, were brought off ; and then 
the vessel was fired. If near land, the captured 
crews were put ashore. Lieutenant Sinclair 
takes some little credit to the " Alabama " for 
materially increasing in this way the population 
of the Azores. It often happened, however, that 
the cruiser found it necessary to play the host 
to so many involuntary guests that she became 
uncomfortably crowded, and the opportunity 
to strike a bargain with some foreign ship to 
take them off was a welcome one. The strange 
crews slept on the open deck, but were pro- 
tected by awnings from sun and rain ; the au- 
thor says they were invariably well treated, 
their officers being accommodated as far as pos- 
sible at the officers' mess of the " Alabama." 
Not infrequently the pleasing prospect of double 
wages and grog twice a day tempted the pris- 
oners into the " Alabama's " service. As for 
the chronometers, they accumulated so rapidly 
that Lieutenant Sinclair soon had to give up 
his daily task of winding them. 

The justification offered for the " Alabama " 
is, of course, that by damaging and threatening 
Northern commerce she drew off the United 
States war vessels from their work of block-

ading Southern ports, and thus materially aided 
the prospects of the Confederacy. She was 
often pursued by United States cruisers, but 
usually evaded them, sometimes running into 
neutral ports and escaping by her superior 
speed. She was a very swift vessel, having 
both steam and sail power. Her armament 
was considered a powerful one, and our author 
is evidently proud of her fighting qualities. 
" She was a fighting ship," he says, " and under 
no circumstances, within reasonable odds, con- 
templated avoiding battle." Yet the truth is 
that the only real fight in which she engaged 
was the one in which she was sent to the bottom. 
A similar fate had been visited by her, it is true, 
upon the United States gunboat " Hatteras " 
the year before in the Gulf of Mexico ; but 
this affair can hardly be classed as a fight. 
The " Alabama " lured the " Hatteras " to her 
side in the night, while purporting to be, and 
announcing herself to be, a British ship ; and 
suddenly, while the small boats of the " Hat- 
teras " were being lowered to come on board 
the " Alabama," the latter opened her broad- 
side in the darkness, sinking the gunboat in 
thirteen minutes. The entire career of the 
" Alabama " was, in fact, that of a sea-rover 
rather than a battle-ship, and her commander's 
fame as a sea-fighter must rest upon the one 
engagement in which he was defeated. 

Lieutenant Sinclair's descriptions of the two 
affairs referred to are worth quoting, as being 
the report of an eye-witness. The first relates 
to the sinking of the " Hatteras." 

" It is dark, the enemy being but indistinctly seen. 
' '. ' .^ e enem y has now come up. She hails us: ' What 
ship is^that ? ' ' This is her Britannic Majesty's steamer 
Petrel,' is the reply. . . . Our crew have lock-strings in 
hand, keeping the guns trained on her, and awaiting the 
command to fire. The two vessels are so near that con- 
versation in ordinary tones can be easily heard from one 
to the other. For a time the < Hatteras ' people seem 
to be consulting. Finally they hailed again: 'If you 
please, I '11 send a boat on board of you,' to which our 
executive officer replied, Certainly, we shall be pleased 
to receive your boat.' When the boat is about half-way 
between the two vessels, the signal is given, and sky and 
water are lighted up by our broadside . . . About six 
broadsides were fired by us. The enemy replied irregu- 
larly. Then she fired a lee gun, and we heard the quick, 
sharp hail of surrender, accompanied by the request that 
our boats be sent to her immediately, as she was sinking. 
The whole thing had passed so quickly that it seemed to 
us like a dream." 

In June, 1864, the "Alabama" put in at 
the harbor of Cherbourg, France. The ship 
was to undergo repairs, and officers and men 
were to have a leave of absence. Three days 
later, the United States war steamer " Kear- 



sarge," under command of Captain Winslow, 
entered the harbor. Immediately on the arrival 
of the " Kearsarge " Commander Semmes for- 
warded to Winslow, through the United States 
Consul, a challenge to fight the " Alabama " 
outside the harbor and beyond the limit of 
French waters. The news was flashed over 
cables and wires, and on Sunday, the llth, 
Cherbourg was filled to overflowing with sight- 
seers, while throughout the world people awaited 
eagerly the result of the naval duel. 

" Our ship, as she steams off shore for her antagonist, 
hull down in the distance and waiting for us, presents a 
brave appearance. The decks and brass-work shine in 
the bright morning sunlight, from recent holystoning 
and polishing. The crew are all in muster uniform, as 
though awaiting Sunday inspection. They are ordered 
to lie down at their quarters for rest, while we approach 
the enemy. A beautiful sight the divisions stripped 
to the waist, and with bare arms and breasts looking 
the athletes they are. The decks have been sanded 
down, tubs of water placed along the spar-deck, and all 
is ready for the fray. The pipe of the boatswain and 
mates at length summons all hands aft; and Semmes, 
mounting a gun-carriage, delivers a stirring address." 

The two vessels steamed some eight miles off 
shore, and, approaching within a mile of each 
other, the "Alabama" delivered a broadside, 
from her starboard batteries. The battle was 
carried on with the contestants circling round 
a common centre. A hundred-pound percus- 
sion shell was early lodged in the " Kearsarge" 
near her screw, but failed to explode. Soon 
after the vessels closed to point-blank range 
the " Alabama " was pierced by a shell at the 
water line. Seeing that his ship was sinking, 
Semmes struck his flag. The officers and crew 
were picked up by the " Kearsarge " and by 
the English yacht " Deerhound," as the " Ala- 
bama " settled under water. 

" The ' Alabama's ' final plunge was a remarkable 
freak, as witnessed by the writer about one hundred 
yards off. She shot up out of the water bow first, and 
descended on the same line, carrying away with her 
plunge two of her masts, and making a whirlpool of 
considerable size and strength." 

Two of the author's best chapters are given 
to the incidents of this memorable sea-fight, 
and will not be overlooked by the reader of 
this interesting volume. The illustrations in- 
clude pictures of the " Alabama " and " Kear- 
sarge," and portraits of Semmes and his offi- 
cers. That of the famous commander, taken 
the day after the Cherbourg fight, shows a 
striking face, thin, careworn, but bold and 
crafty, almost sinister, in expression. The 
appendix contains biographical sketches of all 
the officers, and a general muster-roll of the 
ship's crew. CHARLES H. PALMER.

More of the 
Napoleonic 
revival. 



The literature of the " Napoleonic 
revival " seems destined to show us 
the Emperor from every conceivable 
standpoint, ere the movement completes its course. 
His career has been discussed by historians, moral- 
ists, and military critics ; and his portrait has been 
drawn, or redrawn, by memoirists of every shade 
and variety of opinion and bias, from the hero- 
worshippers down to the malignant Barras. In Con- 
stant's account of "The Private Life of Napoleon" 
(Scribner), we are permitted to see the great man 
through the eyes of his valet de chambre an op- 
portunity that will be eagerly grasped by the large 
class of American readers whose biographical crav- 
ings and standards are reflected in the newspapers. 
We do not mean to impliedly underrate the uses 
and merits of Constant's book, or of the class of 
books to which it belongs. Constant contributes to 
our knowledge of his master very much as men like 
Pepys and Boswell and the virtuoso of Strawberry 
Hill contribute to our knowledge of their times ; 
and the hardiest wiseacre will scarcely impeach the 
historical services of that immortal trio of gossips. 
Constant's book is a rich repository of the sort of 
information that helps us to see the Emperor as his 
daily associates saw him. The author was for four- 
teen consecutive years, from the opening of the 
Marengo campaign to the departure from Fontaine- 
bleau, in constant attendance upon his master, " as 
inseparable from him as his shadow "; and the por- 
trait he draws is vivid, human, and incontestably 
accurate. The vogue of these Memoirs when they 
first appeared, in 1830, was very great; and the 
recent reprint in France has been favorably re- 
ceived. The present translation, admirably done 
by Elizabeth Gilbert Martin, and published in four 
shapely volumes by Messrs. Scribner's Sons, is, we 
believe, the first English version ; and the reader 
will find it decidedly one of the most entertaining 
and graphic of Napoleonic works. Constant brings 
us perhaps nearer to Bonaparte the man than any 
other memoirist of the period has done. A readable 
introduction is furnished by M. Imbert de Saint- 
Amand, who, as usual, is quite unable to deny him- 
self a passing allusion to his " Martyr Queen," as 
he is pleased to style her. Marie Antoinette's suf- 
ferings in the Temple, her high bearing in adver- 
sity, and the stoicism with which she met her fate, 
have blinded romantic and chivalrous minds to the 
ugly fact that this " Martyr Queen " was the centre 
of the vile court ring whose sins previous to the 
Revolution, and whose selfish and insensate policy 
during the Revolution, are as fairly chargeable with 
the excesses of the Terror as the fanaticism and 
blind devotion of the Terrorists themselves. The 
world has so long been accustomed to hold up its 
hands in execration of the political cruelties and 
drastic expedients of that intrepid band of patriots, 
that it has well-nigh lost sight of its services of 



the fact that it saved France from anarchy, from a 
relapse into the fatal gripe of the old order, perhaps 
from the fate of Poland. Louis XVI. was the real 
martyr of the Ancien Regime. With mistakes and 
weaknesses enough, he had no crimes to expiate save 
those of his predecessors. 

The Anglomania which has so long 
disquieted patriotic souls in this coun- 
try has at last fairly given way be- 
fore the tidal wave of Anglophobia evoked by the 
" sturdy Americanism " of a recent state paper. 
Despite this widespread change in the national sen- 
timent, however, there seems to be a class of our 
countrymen who still perversely decline to recog- 
nize hostility to England as a test of patriotism, and 
who even doubt the wisdom of injecting into our 
foreign policy an infusion of the temper of Donny- 
brook Fair. To such peace-loving souls the little 
olive-branch wafted to us over the troubled waters 
in the shape of a book on America by that genial 
Briton, Dean Hole, should prove a welcome and 
timely token. The book is the outcome of the au- 
thor's recent lecturing tour in the States in aid of 
the fund for the restoration of Rochester Cathedral ; 
and we are glad to learn that the pecuniary result 
of the mission was the reverse of disappointing. 
Replying to his English critics who had questioned 
the propriety of " sending round the hat " in Amer- 
ica for an object that should be regarded as a " na- 
tional duty " at home, the Dean concludes pretty 
forcibly : " We had done what we could (at home), 
and I saw no signs of ' national duty ' coming for- 
ward to complete our unfinished work. ... In pre- 
ferring to spend the surplus of five hundred pounds 
which I brought home upon the cathedral, rather 
than in appropriating it to myself, I fail to appre- 
hend that I have acted ' hardly in consonance with 
the dignity of the nation and of the national church.' " 
The Dean writes in his usual chatty, facetious vein, 
skimming lightly over a variety of subjects : our 
clubs, hotels, railways, theatres, churches, horticul- 
ture, our cities and their various forms and degrees 
of misgovernment, etc., treating us and our ways 
with unfailing good-humor save, indeed, when he 
comes to consider our newspapers. " All who love 
America," he says, " must protest against these de- 
gradations. . . . There is no excuse for the piling 
up of the agony, for the proclamations in huge and 
hideous type of the most abominable crimes, for a 
procession of bad men and bad women on the front 
of the stage, as though these actors were of all the 
most important, and as though this ' rogues' march ' 
down the hill to perdition were much more inter- 
esting to the public than the march of intellect, the 
progress of industry, the advancements of science, 
the ascents of religion and of truth." That the 
Dean's book will be widely read in this country goes 
without saying, and it will repay reading if only 
for the novel pleasure of seeing ourselves fairly, 
and for the most part gratifyingly, reflected in a 
mirror held up to us by an English hand.

A journal especially if it be a wo- 
n's - ^ usually an artificial and 
often a morbid piece of writing. 
Such is not the character, however, of "The Jour- 
nal of Countess Franchise Krasinska," just trans- 
lated from the Polish by Kasimir Driekonska, and 
published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. This 
Polish Countess the great-grandmother of Victor 
Emmanuel is the most artless and unsophisticated 
of creatures. Beginning her journal at sixteen and 
keeping it up for two years, she discourses of her- 
self and of things about her with the utmost free- 
dom from bias. She says that she has heard more 
than once that she is pretty, and adds : " Some- 
times, looking in the mirror, I think so myself." 
There are four daughters in the household, and all, 
when they reach the age of sixteen, are taught to 
add to their daily prayers the request for a " good 
husband " a very natural supplication, they think, 
since the husband must take the place of the pa- 
rents, and it is " very right to ask God that he shall 
be good." Not until she is sixteen does this eight- 
eenth-century young woman ever have any money 
to spend, or ever receive a letter through the post- 
office addressed directly to herself. The latter 
event makes the day "forever memorable," and 
the letter and its envelope are preserved as an 
" eternal souvenir." When she is about eighteen, 
the Countess meets Duke Charles, favorite son of 
the King of Poland. It is a case of love at first 
sight on both sides ; and the Countess having no 
reserves from her journal, we get a very pretty 
story of the wooing and wedding. The last words 
of the journal are : " I am sure of my husband's 
faith and love." Alas, that this confidence should 
have been so shaken by years of inconstancy ! 
Continual sorrows took away her strength and her 
wish to write any more ; after a time, however, the 
old affection returned, and the lady's life ended, 
not in the splendor once dreamed of, but in a happy 
home. Both the King and Queen of Italy are the 
great-great-grandchildren of Frangoise Krasinska. 



Memories of 
Paris. 



Mr. F. Adolphus's " Memories of 
Paris " ( Holt ), is an exceedingly 
readable book. In the opening chap- 
ter the writer describes the Paris of forty years 
ago, before the Haussmann reconstruction ; and he 
passes thence to a recital of his recollections of the 
city under the Empire, and during and immedi- 
ately after the siege by the Germans. The entry 
of the latter is graphically described, as are the 
later scenes incident to the rise and fall of the 
Commune this chapter making one realize how 
perfectly capable modern Paris is of repeating, 
under due conditions, the revolutionary excesses of 
a century ago. The Communards of 1871 were, 
in capacity for evil and the brute instinct of de- 
structiveness, plainly no whit behind the ferocious 
rabble by means of which the Jacobin extremists 
swayed, saved, and dishonored the great Revolu- 
tion. Among other dramatic episodes of the time, 



the author witnessed the pulling down of the Ven- 
dome Column one of the many insensate perform- 
ances of the latter-day Sans Culottes. The first 
attempt had failed, the great structure steadily 
resisting the strain of rope and windlass. But after 
an hour's delay, says the author, " I had become 
conscious, after a particularly savage jerk on the 
ropes, that the line between the chimney and the 
statue was no longer exactly straight. Slowly 
very slowly the statue swerved past the chimney ;. 
slowly the great column bowed towards me never 
did anyone receive so superb a salutation ; slowly 
it descended, so slowly that it almost seemed to hesi- 
tate : in a great haze of spurting dust it fell. . . . 
With a wild rush and frantic shouts, the people 
dashed past the sentries into the Place Vendoine, 
leaped upon the dislocated fragments, and howled 
coarse insults at them." Allowing for a rather pro- 
nounced tendency to overcolor in his more dramatic 
passages, we think Mr. Adolphus (who was evi- 
dently at Paris as a press correspondent) may be ac- 
cepted as a trustworthy narrator. An amusing chap- 
ter is devoted to Mr. Worth, and another to General 

Boulanger. 

A remarkable Whoever buys " Macaire, a Melo- 
performance dramatic Farce " (Stone & Kimball) 

of genius. because it is by Robert Louis Steven- 

son and William Ernest Henley, will be apt to won- 
der a little, after he has read it, how those distin- 
guished men of letters happened to bring it to pass. 
The work may perhaps have had peculiar antece- 
dents : it may have been written for the stage and 
been refused ; it may possibly have been written for 
a wager ; it may have been written for the " Chap- 
Book," in which we believe it has appeared ; it may 
even have been written only for fun. These mat- 
ters, however, are not before the general reading 
public (curiously enough, too, in these days of the 
omniscient literary gossip), and the average reader 
will take the book for whatever he finds between its 
covers. Thus regarded, without adventitious props, 
" Macaire " is a remarkable performance of genius. 
In a book written in collaboration, there is usually 
some curiosity as to what was written by which. In 
this case we note a comparison that came out of one 
of Mr. Henley's poems, and a curiously un-English 
use of the word " one " which was kindly lent by 
Mr. Attwater of " Ebb Tide " fame ; otherwise it is 
hard to say which author was most responsible. If 
Mr. Gilbert had never written, it would probably 
have been different. The traditional Macaire is 
certainly a character with opportunities ; it would 
seem on the face of things that Stevenson at least 
might have incarnated him once more, might have 
given us a new reading of the character, might have 
put in a form to be remembered that vague con- 
ception of intellect, effrontery, and un-morality. 
But it was not to be ; and all that can now be done 
by the reader if he be, as we are, a lover of Ste- 
venson and an admirer of Henley is to drop the 
book silently into the river of oblivion, trusting that 
no Astolpho will ever find it necessary to rescue it.

" A Manual of Public International 
. Law " (Macmillan), by Thomas Al- 

f red Walker, Lecturer at Cambridge, 
England, is designed as an introductory text-book 
" for the use of students commencing to read Pub- 
lic International Law." Its simple plan is the pre- 
sentation of the rules that have been established by 
the agreement of modern nations, in the form of 
propositions, tersely stated, eighty-six in number. 
For example, No. 41 is : " The final touchstone dis- 
tinguishing belligerent from neutral, is willing sub- 
jection to belligerent or to neutral control." No. 
60 is : " It is the duty of a neutral ruler to refuse 
the right of passage across his territory to belliger- 
ent troops." Each proposition is illustrated by com- 
mentary, at greater or less length, generally based 
on and illustrating one or more historical incidents, 
nearly all of which are of great interest. Mr. 
Walker's novel plan of teaching this frequently dry 
subject will no doubt be well received. His style is 
far from dry, and his book is agreeably readable. 
He adheres to the term " law " as applied to interna- 
tional usages, though agreeing that they " lack alike 
determinate lawgiver, determinate sanction, and de- 
terminate enforcing court," because each nation 
adopting those usages treats them as law, and fur- 
nishes them a sanction by voluntarily observing 
them. Very many of the precedents cited by Mr. 
Walker as authorities are drawn from the interna- 
tional complications in which the United States has 
participated ; and references to American decisions 
and American commentaries are frequent Story 
being styled " the great American judge." Indeed, 
the pages of this English commentator bear abund- 
ant testimony to the great part which our republic 
has played in modifying former international usages 
and aiding to establish the progressive modern rules ; 
for we have taken the lead in many instances in 
the work of introducing them. 



Miscellaneous Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
writings of have done readers a great a very 

Waiter Bagehot. grea t service in republishing the 
miscellaneous writings of Walter Bagehot. Five 
volumes of their neat and inexpensive " Silver Li- 
brary " are devoted to this purpose, and include all 
of Bagehot that the general reader wants, aside 
from the " English Constitution " and " Physics and 
Politics," both of which works are easily procurable. 
Three volumes of literary studies, one of biograph- 
ical studies, and one of economic studies, make up 
the set. There is a portrait of the author, and a 
sympathetic memoir by his friend, Mr. R. H. Hutton. 
Bagehot was not always right, but he never failed 
to be interesting. In one of his essays, contrasting 
Shakespeare with Milton, he says : " The latter, 
who was still by temperament, and a schoolmaster 
by trade, selects a beautiful object, puts it straight 
out before him and his readers, and accumulates 
upon it all the learned imagery of a thousand years ; 
Shakespeare glances at it, and says something of his 
own." So the average critic, writing of Shelley, or 



Be'ranger, or Scott, gives us, as a rule, the conven- 
tional judgments that have been accumulating for 
years ; whereas Bagehot always " says something of 
his own." And, even if we dissent from this some- 
thing, it somehow sets us to thinking along new 
lines, and we are glad that Bagehot said it. Mr. 
Hutton, in editing this series of volumes, has made 
considerable use of the notes prepared by Mr. For- 
rest Morgan for the edition of Bagehot published 
a few years ago by the Travellers' Insurance Com- 
pany, of Hartford. That edition contained, also, 
the longer works, which the present one does not ; 
but, on the other hand, Mr. Hutton has added a 
number of papers that Mr. Morgan failed to include. 

Mr. Gilbert M. Tucker's modest vol- 
on "Our Common Speech" 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a collection 
of six good but disconnected essays on matters of 
linguistic interest ; and is not so much a handbook 
to be consulted at need as a book to be read and 
enjoyed. The book is more in the line of Trench 
and R. G. White than of Sievers and Sweet ; but 
this does not prevent its being a scholarly, albeit 
popular, piece of work. Mr. Tucker's interest is in 
present usage and past meanings. Although he 
gives no indication of great breadth of reading, he 
is well equipped as far as familiarity with the dic- 
tionaries is concerned, and he realizes perfectly just 
what he can do best. His two papers on Diction- 
aries are very convenient : the first gathers a good 
deal about the old dictionaries which is new, doubt- 
less, even to many students ; while his remarks on 
later dictionaries are eminently sensible. Start- 
ing from this lexicographical standpoint, we have 
the first essay in the book on the necessity of using 
words exactly and correctly, and the last on Amer- 
icanisms (chiefly on the subject of Briticisms), with 
a good bibliography. These four essays have some- 
thing of an enduring interest, and will probably be 
a stimulant and a guide to just the readers they are 
intended for. More entertaining than important is 
the essay on " Degraded Words ": those familiar 
with the principle in question will be interested in 
Mr. Tucker's collection of examples ; those who have 
never thought of change of meanings in language 
will probably fail rightly to estimate its import. 
Lastly, the paper on the English of the Revised 
Version, although its points are well taken, is rather 
fragmentary, and, on the whole, ephemeral. The 
book is easily and pleasantly written, and will prob- 
ably be enjoyed by the student and the more general 
reader. 

The antique Mr - Laurence Hutton, well known to 
of Sports and readers of " Harper's Magazine, is 
Festivals. prepared to affirm that the facts set 

down in " Other Times and Other Seasons " (Har- 
per) have " never hitherto been gathered together in 
any single volume." This may or may not be the 
case : more important is it that, such as they are, 
these little collections of information about football,

golf, tobacco, St. Valentine's day, and so forth, are 
just the things to interest and please many people. 
Bits of antiquarian lore, out-of-the-way quotations 
from good literature, reminiscence of old-time cus- 
toms, all this, and much else, makes very pleasant 
reading, and admirably serves the purpose for which 
the volume was intended. Mr. Hutton is a large 
reader, even of books which seem stupid to the 
world at large ; and everyone knows his cleverness 
at getting something out of almost anything. In 
the present case he has pored over many rare vol- 
umes and gathered much recondite learning ; he 
also deals genially with the " Badminton Library," 
as even with the " Century Dictionary." His bits 
of information, both quaint and commonplace, are 
displayed and arranged with a bland humor quite in 
keeping with the picture of himself that forms the 
frontispiece of this pretty little book. 

"Charm and Courtesy in Letter- 
2*""*; Writing" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a 

pleasant and useful volume, pleas- 
ant to those whose letters are by nature charming 
and courteous, and useful to those who hitherto have 
had little thought of either courtesy or charm when 
they had occasion to communicate with others by 
the medium of the public post. Of the latter class 
there are almost too many in the present era of 
printed letter-heads and postal cards, and if one 
could be certain they were amenable to kind treat- 
ment it would be wise to do one's best to help cir- 
culate Miss Callaway's book. Whether or not it 
succeeds in softening the manners of those who 
might be helped by it, the book is pleasant reading, 
especially for those who have no pressing need of it. 
It is easily written, with a slight conventionality of 
sentiment, and a semblance of method (as wine-jelly 
is sometimes moulded into the form of a verte- 
brate), but not enough to do any harm. The au- 
thor has extracted many good letters from episto- 
lary literature, and shows a pleasant appreciation of 
them, which, it is to be hoped, she will convey to 
many readers. 

An unusually bright and suggestive 
sheaf of silhouettes of foreign travel 
is Mr. W. D. McCrackan's pretty 
booklet, " Little Idyls of the Big World " (Joseph 
Knight Co.). Mr. McCrackan is the author of 
several serious historical books ; and his " Idyls," 
with not a little of sparkle and lightness of touch, 
show a vein of thought and sentiment that lifts them 
considerably above the common run of travel pic- 
tures. A few of the titles are : " Pontifex Maxi- 
mus," " A Riot in Rome," " A Woman of Paris," 
" A Sunday in Vienna," " The Sultan's Prayer," 
"At the Manoeuvres," "Self-Government," etc., 
the last-named paper giving a graphic account of 
the meeting of the inhabitants of a Swiss canton to 
vote on the adoption of a new constitution. There 
are several illustrations, including a photographic 
plate of Bastien Le Page's beautiful portrait of 
Jeanne D'Arc.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Professor H. Graetz's " History of the Jews," issued 
by the Jewish Publication Society of America, has been 
brought down to the present time by publication of a 
fifth volume, which covers the period from the Chmiel- 
nicki persecution in Poland (1648) to the year 1870. 
The work is not, however, completed, for a supplemen- 
tary volume is promised, to include a memoir of the 
author, a chronological analysis of Jewish history, an 
index to the entire work, and a series of maps. The 
Society also offers a prize of one thousand dollars for a 
story upon a Jewish subject suited to young readers. 
From twenty thousand to thirty thousand words is the 
stipulated length, and particulars of the competition 
may be had from Miss Henrietta Szold, 708 West Lom- 
bard street, Baltimore. 

In his account of " The Minute Man on the Frontier " 
(Crowell), the Rev. William G. Puddefoot recounts his 
experiences as a frontier missionary in the Western 
States. The author writes in a " breezy," off-hand way, 
and his book will doubtless prove entertaining to readers 
interested in the various phases of Western frontier life. 
It contains a number of interesting photographic plates ; 
and there is a frontispiece portrait of Mr. Puddefoot, 
with his signature in^ac simile. 

" The Warwick Library of English Literature " (im- 
ported by Scribner) is a new series of books, under the 
editorship of Professor C. H. Herford, each of which 
is to " deal with the development in English literature 
of some special literary form, which will be illustrated 
by a series of representative specimens, slightly anno- 
tated, and preceded by a critical analytical introduc- 
tion." The first volume of this series, with an intro- 
duction by Mr. Edmund K. Chambers, is devoted to 
" English Pastorals," from the sixteenth to the eight- 
eenth century, and has just been published. Volumes 
to follow will deal with such subjects as " Literary Crit- 
icism," Letter- Writers," "Tales in Verse," "English 
Essays," and "English Masques." The several vol- 
umes are in the hands of competent scholars, who may 
be trusted to carry out acceptably the excellent idea of 
which the series is an embodiment. 

A translation of Dr. Lassar-Cohn's " Laboratory Man- 
ual of Organic Chemistry," made by Dr. Alexander 
Smith (Macmillan), provides American students with 
an extremely useful " Compendium of the methods ac- 
tually used in the laboratory in the prosecution of organic 
work." What variations from the original have been 
embodied in this version have received the sanction of 
the author, and may be considered improvements upon 
the German text. We have also received a treatise on 
" The Fatty Compounds " (Longmans), by Mr. R. Lloyd 
Whiteley; and a little book on "Practical Proofs of 
Chemical Laws " (Longmans), by Mr. Vaughan Cornish. 

The Cid " of Corneille, edited by Professor F. M. 
Warren, is the latest addition to Heath's Modern Lan- 
guage Series. Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish, in their 
series of modern language texts, " Les Pre"cieuses Rid- 
icules " of Moli&re, edited by Mr. M. W. Davis; and a 
volume of sketches of travel, called " Places and Peo- 
ple," edited by Dr. Jules Luquiens. The latter is an 
old book, with new numbers added, seven chapters in 
all, from such writers as Dumas, Scherer, " Loti," and 
Taine. "En Wagon" and "C'Etait Gertrude," two 
little parlor comedies by M. Verconsin, are edited by 
M. Baptists Me"ras for Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.

LITERARY NOTES. 

" The Critic " of New York celebrates its fifteenth 
birthday with its issue of January 18. We heartily 
congratulate our younger contemporary on its years 
and honors. 

Colonel Thomas W. Knox, the well-known traveller 
and writer of books for boys, died on the 6th of Jan- 
uary at his rooms in the New York Lotus Club, at the 
age of sixty. 

Henrik Jseger, who wrote the best biography of Dr. 
Ibsen thus far published, and was afterwards engaged 
in the preparation of a history of Norwegian literature, 
died last month in Christiana, at the age of fifty-one. 

The friends of Mr. Edward J. McPhelim, one of the 
best literary and dramatic critics ever connected with 
journalism in Chicago, will be grieved to learn of the 
violent attack of insanity that befell him on the seventh 
of this month, while a visitor in New York. 

Messrs. Way & Williams have received from Mr. 
Morris's " Kelmscott Press " their artistic edition of 
Rossetti's "Hand and Soul." Only 541 copies were 
printed for both England and America; and a good 
portion of them were sold in advance of publication. 

Volume XLV. of the " Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy " (Macmillan) extends from Pereira to Pockrich. 
It includes noteworthy studies of the two Pitts, but 
little else of marked interest. The P's do not seem to 
have included as many great Englishmen as the other 
letters of the alphabet. 

The many friends of the late Eugene Field will be 
glad to learn of the new and uniform edition of his com- 
plete works, announced by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. It will be in ten volumes, each with a photogra- 
vure frontispiece. Besides the regular edition, there 
will be a special numbered edition of a hundred sets, 
printed on Japan paper. 

It is stated that the " American Men of Letters " se- 
ries is to be extended in the near future to include vol- 
umes upon Bayard Taylor and Hawthorne, the former 
by Mr. A. H. Smyth, the latter by Mr. G. E. Wood- 
berry. Hawthorne, it will be remembered, is the one 
American included in the " English Men of Letters " 
series, edited by Mr. John Morley. 

The first annual meeting of the Central Modern Lan- 
guage Conference was held in the Lecture Hall of the 
University of Chicago, on the 30th of December and 
the two days following. As the aims of this Confer- 
ence have already been set forth in THE DIAL, it will 
suffice to remind our readers that the increasing interest 
in modern languages in the West and Southwest seemed 
to make such a Conference desirable. The success of 
this first meeting proved the correctness of that belief. 
There were present teachers and professors from most 
of the Western States, representing the Universities 
of Chicago, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Louisiana, 
the Northwestern University, Washington University, 
and many other institutions. A programme of twenty- 
three numbers, including papers on literary and linguis- 
tic topics in German, English,' and French was listened 
to by an audience of from sixty to one hundred and 
fifty persons, mostly specialists. Such discussion as the 
brief time permitted followed the papers; and further 
measures of importance with regard to the future of the 
organization were taken. Propositions for cooperation 
having been received from the American Modern Lan- 



guage Association, the Conference determined to re- 
solve itself into the " Central Division " of that Asso- 
ciation. This division will maintain its own organization, 
and meet at least twice in three years, with the expec- 
tation that the National Association will meet the third 
year at some point in the Central District, when there 
will be a joint session. Publication will be controlled 
by a joint committee from the two societies, and one 
membership fee gives to members of the Central Divis- 
ion the right of membership in the Association. The 
latter organization has decided to meet at Cleveland 
next year. The officers of the Central Division for the 
ensuing year are: Prof. W. H. Carruth, University of 
Kansas, President; Prof. C. A. Smith, University of 
Louisiana, Prof. E. T. Owen, University of Wisconsin, 
and Prof. G. T. Hench, University of Michigan, Vice- 
Presidents; Prof. H. Schmidt- Wartenberg, University 
of Chicago, Secretary. 

Of the appointment of Mr. Alfred Austin as succes- 
sor to the line of English poets laureate, perhaps the 
best that can be said is that there have been worse ones. 
It is the contrast between him and those whom he im- 
mediately follows, that makes the appointment so unac- 
ceptable to the public and inauspicious to him; for in 
the brilliancy of the two great names that have given 
the title its chief glory, it will be hard for Mr. Austin's 
light to show more than a doubtful glimmer. The 
new laureate is already sixty years of age. He took 
his degree at the University of London in 1853, and 
began life as a barrister, but soon turned to literary 
and journalistic work. For many years he has been 
one of the best-known " leader writers " in London, and 
for ten years edited " The National Review." He is a 
Roman Catholic in religion and a Conservative in poli- 
tics. His first poem, " Randolph," was published when 
he was in his nineteenth year. He has been a prolific 
writer, his collected works in verse, published by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co., filling six volumes. His latest vol- 
ume, " In Veronica's Garden," has appeared since the 
new year; and from it, as a favorable example of his 
lyric power, and as particularly pertinent at the present 
time, we give an extract which re-echoes in no unworthy 
strain the old song of peace and good- will: 

" But not alone for those who still 
Within the Mother-Land abide, 
We deck the porch, we dress the sill, 
And fling the portals open wide. 

" But unto all of British blood 

Whether they cling to Egbert's Throne, 
Or, far beyond the Western flood, 
Have reared a Sceptre of their own, 

" And, half -regretful, yearn to win 

Their way back home, and fondly claim 
The rightful share of kith and kin 
In Alfred's glory, Shakespeare's fame, 

" We pile the logs, we troll the stave, 
We waft the tidings wide and far, 
And speed the wish, on wind and wave, 
To Southern Cross and Northern Star. 

" Yes ! Peace on earth, Atlantic strand ! 

Peace and good-will. Pacific shore ! 
Across the waters stretch your hand, 
And be our brothers more and more I 

" Blood of our blood, in every clime ! 

Race of our race, by every sea ! 
To you we sing the Christmas rhyme, 
For you we light the Christmas-tree."

VISIONS AND SERVICE. 

Discourses preached in Collegiate Chapels by the Right Rev. WILLIAM LAWRENCE, Bishop of 

the Diocese of Massachusetts. 16ino, $1.25. 

Bishop Lawrence gathers under this felicitous title a group of discourses which cannot fail to attract general 
attention. They are thoughtful, sympathetic, vivid appeals to the good sense, the sweet reasonableness, and seri- 
ous thought of men. Young men, especially, will respond to the direct, manly, stimulating qualities of this book, 
though its interest and helpfulness are by no means restricted to them. The discourses are short, specific in aim, 
and are pleasantly charged with the agreeable, winning element of the writer's personality. 

JOAN OF ARC. 

By FRANCIS C. LOWELL. Large crown 8vo, $2.00. 

Mr. Lowell has made a thorough, impartial study of the career of the Maid of Orleans, and he presents the 
results in a book which cannot fail to impress readers by its evident effort to get at all the facts, and to state them 
in a way that will cause his book to harmonize in some good degree with the Life of Joan of Arc, which will event- 
ually form the standard and final account of her. Mr. Lowell's review of the trial scene gains great value from 
his experience as a lawyer, and the whole book will be found worthy of very careful study. 

BAYARD TAYLOR. 

In the series of American Men of Letters. By ALBERT H. SMYTH. With a Portrait. 

16mo, gilt top, $1.25. 

This is a careful, appreciative, sympathetic account of the literary career of Bayard Taylor, whose large and 
highly diversified achievements entitle him to an honorable place in the ranks of American Men of Letters. The 
hardships, struggles, indomitable perseverence and steady growth of Taylor's literary life are well described ; and 
the crowning touch of pathos is added in his sudden death at the moment of assured success, when, by virtue of 
his achievements in letters and his high character, he held the office of United States Minister at Berlin. 

THE SPIRIT IN LITERATURE AND LIFE. 

By JOHN P. COTLE, D.D. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

This book will in some good degree commemorate the spirit and service of Dr. Coyle, by whose death the pul- 
pit of America lost one of its noteworthy figures. It is a strong, thoughtful book, worthy to rank with Dr. Gordon's 
volume on " The Christ of To-Day," which has made so profound an impression, and with Dr. Denison's deeply 
interesting study of " Christ's Idea of the Supernatural." In other words, it is a book representing well the type 
and tendency of modern religious thought. 

THE PARSON'S PROXY. 

A Novel. By KATE W. HAMILTON, author of " Eachel's Share of the Koad." 

16mo, $1.25. 

Mrs. Hamilton here tells a tale of the Southern mountain region, where primitive conditions still hold. 
Thither a young preacher comes to live; but the hero of the story is a rough native who injures the parson, and 
afterwards thinks he must atone for it by taking his place. He preaches once or twice while the parson is recov- 
ering, and becomes a thorough Christian ; and later makes a supreme sacrifice in the preacher's behalf. The dia- 
lect and dialogue are good and faithful, and there is a manliness about the tale that wins the reader's admiration. 
It is a vigorous, readable novel, and may well enjoy a good degree of popular favor.

*#* " I resolved to put into print any verses of hers which I could find, such as would sustain her poetical reputation, or be of substantial 
interest as showing the growth of her mind. I looked carefully through the materials which she had left behind her ; found many things which I 
remembered, and others of which I knew little or nothing ; and perceived that the amount of her unpublished verse was considerably in excess of

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



MOVEMENT. 

By E. J. MABBY, Member of the Institute and of the Academy 
of Medicine ; Professor at the College of France ; author of 
"Animal Mechanism." Translated by EKIC PRITCHAKD, 
M.A. With 200 illustrations. Vol. 73, International Scien- 
tific Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

The present work describes the methods employed in the 
extended development of photography of moving objects at- 
tained in the last few years, and shows the importance of such 
researches in mechanics and other departments of physics, 
the fine arts, physiology, and zoology, and in regulating the 
walking or marching of men and the gait of horses. 

THE SUN. 

By C. A. YOUNG, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of Astronomy in 
Princeton University. New and revised edition, with nu- 
merous illustrations. International Scientific Series. 12mo, 
cloth, $2.00. 

Since the original publication of this book, in 1881, great 
advances have been made in our knowledge of the sun ; and 
although, in subsequent editions, notes and appendices have 
kept the work fairly up to date, the author has deemed it best 
to thoroughly revise it, embodying the notes in the text, and 
rewriting certain portions. This edition is therefore repre- 
sentative of the solar science of to-day, including important 
spectroscopic discoveries which have been made during the 
revision. 

THE SONGS AND MUSIC OF FROEBEL'S 
MOTHER PLAY. 

Prepared and arranged by SUSAN E. BLOW. Fully illustrated. 

Vol. 32. International Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This is the second and concluding volume of Miss Blow's 
version of Froebel's noted work which laid the foundation for 
that important branch of early education, the kindergarten. 
The first volume, " The Mottoes and Commentaries," may be 
designated as the Teacher's or Mother's book, and "The 
Songs and Music," the present volume, as the Children's book. 
In the latter, many of the pictures have been enlarged in parts 
to bring out the details more distinctly. New translations are 
made of the songs, eliminating the crudities of poetic compo- 
sition that have appeared in the literal imitations of Froebel, 
and new music is substituted where the original has been dis- 
carded. 

APPLETONS' HAND-BOOK OF WINTER RE- 
SORTS FOR TOURISTS AND INVALIDS. 

New Edition, December, 1895, revised to date. With Maps, 
Illustrations, Table of Railroad Fares, etc. 12mo, paper 
cover, 50 cts. 
This standard manual gives complete information as to 

winter sanitariums and places of resort in the United States, 

the West Indies, the Bermudas, the Sandwich Islands, and 

Mexico. 

THE DOG IN HEALTH AND IN DISEASE. 

By WESLEY MILLS, M.D., D.V.S., author of "A Text-Book 
of Animal Physiology," "A Text-Book of Comparative 
Physiology," etc. New edition, revised and enlarged. 
With colored plate, 43 full-page cuts, and numerous other 
illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $2.25. 

" The library of everyone interested in the dog should contain a copy 
of this work." American Stockkeeper. 

_" Altogether the work is one of great use to the breeder and the vet- 
erinary student, and one that should find a place in every dog-man's 
kennel-shelf and library." Forest and Stream. 



A SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE. 

By M. HAMILTON. No. 183, Town and Country Library. 

12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 

A singularly brilliant study of fashionable life in England 
and country life in Ireland, by a new writer of the greatest 
promise. The general theme, a woman's unselfish loyalty, is 
suggested with great adroitness. This is one of the cleverest 
social studies of the day. 

SUCCESSORS TO THE TITLE. 

By Mrs. L. B. WALFORD, author of " Baby's Grandmother," 
etc. No. 184, Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 
cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

Readers of the best contemporary fiction know how to ap- 
preciate this popular author's lightness of touch and unfailing 
humor. 

STONEPASTURES. 

By ELEANOR STUART. 16mo, cloth, 75 cents. 
This graphic picture of quaint characters belongs to the 
class of specialized American fiction which has been headed 
by the work of Miss Wilkins, Mr. Cable, Colonel Johnston, 
Mr. Garland, and others. The author has studied the pecu- 
liar and almost unknown life of the laborers in a Pennsylvania 
mining and manufacturing town with a keenness of observa- 
tion and an abundant sense of humor which will give her book 
a permanent place among the genre studies of American life. 

COURTSHIP BY COMMAND. 

By M. M. BLAKE. 16mo, cloth, 75 cents. 
This interesting historical romance presents Napoleon in a 
new light. 

THE STORY OF THE INDIAN. 

By GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL, author of "Pawnee Hero 
Stories," " Blackfoot Lodge Tales," etc. The first volume 
in the Story of the West Series, edited by REPLEY HITCH- 
COCK. With 16 full-page Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The object of this series is to preserve the picturesque and 
individual types of a life in the real West which is rapidly 
fading away, and to offer the romantic stories of the Indian, 
explorer, cowboy, miner, soldier, and other representative fig- 
ures in a permanent form. Mr. Grinnell's intimate personal 
knowledge of his subject has enabled him to draw an admir- 
ably graphic picture of the actual Indian, whose home life, 
religious observances, amusements, together with the various 
phases of his devotion to war and the chase, and finally the 
effects of encroaching civilization, are delineated with a cer- 
tainty and an absence of sentimentalism or hostile prejudice 
which impart a peculiar distinction to this eloquent story of 
a passing life.

THE YOUNG PERSON. 

It is a well-known principle of pathology that 
interference with the normal activity of an or- 
gan results in functional perversion. The 
atrophy that follows upon the disuse of one 
organ may have for a concomitant the exces- 
sive development of others, with some form of 
degeneration as a consequence ; or the over- 
stimulation of one may be accompanied by a 
weakening of all the others, leading in the end 
to dissolution. In either case, whether the dis- 
turbing physiological factor take the shape of 
a forced activity here or a suppressed activity 
there, the result is some development of dis- 
tinctly morbid type. Now the analogies be- 
tween the organism of the individual and the 
larger social organism are always instructive, 
if philosophically dealt with, and the thought 
of the past thirty or forty years has been par- 
ticularly fruitful in applications of this method 
of comparison. The whole modern science of 
sociology, for example, may be described as an 
expansion of this fundamental idea, and gets 
its most trustworthy results from the intelligent 
discussion of these analogies. It is our pur- 
pose just now to apply to one aspect of literary 
activity the method in question, and to ask if 
it may not have some instruction for the critic 
of contemporary literature. 

That reverence is due to the young is one of 
the most venerable of critical maxims. It has 
been knocking about in literature ever since 
its embalmment in one of the satires of Ju- 
venal, and perhaps for longer than that. It 
has very noticeably influenced the literary pro- 
duction of the present century, but it has not 
always been wisely apprehended and applied. 
Let us take a moment to see what has been 
done with this precept in the case of the two 
greatest literatures of our time the French 
and the English. In both instances there has 
been at work a sub-conscious instinct that has 
sought to keep from the contemplation of youth- 
ful minds certain parts of human life and cer- 
tain phases of human emotion. But the instinct 
has worked itself out in curiously different 
ways. French books have become sharply dif- 
ferentiated into books for the Young Person 
and books for the full-grown man or woman. 
English books, on the other hand, have nearly

all been written, until very lately, with the 
Young Person carefully in view, and, it would 
often seem, without any consideration for any 
other class of readers. These two theories, car- 
ried to extremes, have been productive of the 
most ludicrous results, exemplified, in the one 
case, by the school - girl editions of " Tele- 
maque " which carefully substitute amitie for 
amour ; in the other, by such an anecdote as 
has recently gone the rounds of the newspapers, 
revealing the fact that a popular magazine of 
wide circulation in this country does not per- 
mit any mention of wine to be made in its 
pages. And both of these theories, even when 
kept within bounds, seem to us to have led to 
an abnormal condition of things in the litera- 
tures that have respectively practised them. 

We all know Matthew Arnold's hard saying 
about the French people that they have de- 
voted themselves to the worship of the great 
goddess of lubricity. This remark was never 
meant to be taken without qualification, as many 
passages of Arnold's critical work show plainly 
enough. It may be sufficient to instance his 
judgment of George Sand, pronounced upon 
hearing of her death. " She was the greatest 
spirit in our European world from the time that 
Goethe departed. With all her faults and 
Frenchisms, she was this." The warmest ad- 
mirers of that woman of genius will feel that 
something more than justice is done her by this 
bit of eulogy, but they will also feel that the 
man who uttered it must have had strong 
grounds for what harsh things he at times felt 
bound to say about modern French literature. 
That literature doubtless gives undue promi- 
nence to one particular form of passion, and 
doubtless sins against the proprieties more fre- 
quently and more conspicuously than any lit- 
erature ought to do. To revert to the patho- 
logical figure of our introductory paragraph, 
French literature seems, in its treatment of the 
relations of the sexes, to have suffered a sort of 
fatty degeneration, and erotic pates defoie have 
entered too largely into the daily diet of its con- 
sumers. It seems to us quite clear that one of 
the causes of this abnormal development must 
be sought for in an unnatural separation of 
books for the Young Person from books for 
the Gallic adult. Since (in theory, at least) 
the Young Person is never supposed to see the 
books written for his elders, there is no need 
of writing them virginibus puerisque^ and all 
restraint and all reticence are thrown to the 
winds. 

The English theory, of course, has been as 



far removed from the French theory as possi- 
ble. Taking for granted that the Young Per- 
son is quite as likely as anybody else to read 
a book of any sort, all books (broadly speak- 
ing) have been written with his needs and lim- 
itations in view, and the result has been an 
emasculated literature, from which discussion 
of certain subjects has been excluded by as ef- 
fective a taboo as was ever practised among 
the South Sea Islanders. Newspaper cant and 
the censorship of the circulating libraries have 
so narrowed the scope of nineteenth-century 
English literature that the future student of 
Victorian manners and morals will have to go 
outside of literature to get the facts in proper 
perspective. These remarks apply with equal 
force to the English literature produced upon 
our own side of the Atlantic. The suppres- 
sion of natural literary activity thus indi- 
cated has been correcting itself of late, and in 
the usual violent way. Unless atrophy has 
gone so far as to prove fatal, nature usually 
contrives to reassert herself, and throws the 
whole organism into disorder by so doing. The 
last few years have brought realism and plain- 
speaking back into English literature, and with 
a vengeance. The dovecotes of hypocrisy have 
been fluttered by ominous birds of prey, and 
the sober-minded, who have all along viewed 
with apprehension the attempt to keep English 
literature in a strait- jacket, have stood alter- 
nately amused and aghast at the antics with 
which it has celebrated its newly-acquired lib- 
erty. 

The problem is certainly a vexatious one. 
The example of one nation shows us the bad 
effects of ignoring the Young Person ; the ex- 
ample of another furnishes an instructive les- 
son in the consequences of deferring to him 
overmuch. Unbounded license is an unques- 
tionable evil ; the cramping of ideals, on the 
other hand, leads to a reaction almost equally 
evil. Whether the one course be pursued or 
the other, freedom of literary expression will 
find its stout champions, as it has already found 
them in both countries, from Moliere to Mr. 
Swinburne. We do not want a revival of eigh- 
teenth century grossness. Mr. Gosse says, in 
a recent critique, that with Mr. Hardy's latest 
novel " we have traced the full circle of pro- 
priety. A hundred and fifty years ago, Field- 
ing and Smollett brought up before us pictures, 
used expressions, described conduct, which ap- 
peared to their immediate successors a little 
more crude than general reading warranted. 
In Miss Burney's hands, and in Miss Austin's,

the morals were still further hedged about. 
Scott was even more daintily reserved. We 
came at last to Dickens, where the clamorous 
passions of mankind, the coarser accidents of 
life, were absolutely ignored, and the whole 
question of population seemed reduced to the 
theory of the gooseberry bush. This was the ne 
plus ultra of decency ; Thackeray and George 
Eliot relaxed this intensity of prudishness ; 
once on the turn, the tide flowed rapidly, and 
here is Mr. Hardy ready to say any mortal 
thing that Fielding said, and a great deal more 
too." 

Fortunately, we are not yet forced to take 
" Jude the Obscure " as typical of our century 
and literature, although atrocious faults of 
taste displayed by that book do not stand alone 
to represent their class. And we cannot agree 
with Mr. Gosse in saying that to censure such 
outspokenness " is the duty of the moralist and 
not the critic." If criticism has any most im- 
perative duty, it is precisely the one so airily 
disclaimed by this self-constituted spokesman 
for the craft. And there is not much pallia- 
tion for such an offence as Mr. Hardy's in the 
prefatory danger-signal which describes the 
book as " a novel addressed by a man to men 
and women of full age." This is the French 
theory over again, and might be used to cloak 
all of the French excesses. It seems to us that 
the real solution of the problem presented by 
the Young Person must take the form of a 
compromise, and that a compromise is possible 
that shall mean neither a loss of virility in lit- 
erature nor the exposure of the immature to 
corrupting influences. We need, first of all, 
to clear our minds of cant on the subject of the 
supposed ignorance of the Young Person. The 
Frenchman knows perfectly well that his theory 
does not work, and that boys and girls read the 
books they are not supposed to read. The En- 
glishman knows equally well that his theory 
works no better, and that boys and girls who 
do not get a knowledge of life from literature 
get it in other and usually worse ways. Why 
should we not admit right away that our edu- 
cation is not as frank as it ought to be ? With 
this admission we might couple the plea, on the 
one hand, for less prudishness than we have 
been accustomed to put into books likely to 
fall into the hands of the Young Person ; while 
sternly insisting, on the other hand, that all 
literature should be clean, that grossness is a 
thing unpardonable in itself, and not merely 
for its degrading influence upon a certain pos- 
sible class of readers. Some such middle ground 



as this should be found safe for all the interests 
concerned ; it should result in a literature both 
strengthened and purified, not losing from view 
the needs of the Young Person, but rather ac- 
cording them a more rational consideration 
than they have had hitherto. 



TO WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, DRAMATIST. 

(After having read Henrik Ibsen, dramatist. ) 

Forgive me, ample soul, in whom man's joy 
Finds room for laughter, as his grief for sighs, 
If e'er I leave thee for an hour's emprise 

Where live but souls made sick with life's annoy. 

I bartered Time's best coin without alloy, 
And sailed with him within an inlet's rise 
Where stricken ghosts, with tragic voice and guise, 

Made thy world seem a dire fantastic toy. 

O Ocean, take me back to thee, and fill 

My sails once more with elemental breath 
With wind that haunts thy choric world- wide spell ; 
Some truth may say, " All 's well," or " All is ill," 
But on thine azure line 'twixt life and death 

The whole of truth speaks clear: "All shall be well."

CLASSIC SLANG. 

It is a matter of current observation and remark 
that the slang of to-day is orthodox literature to-mor- 
row. But it is not so commonplace that modern slang 
can often " point with pride " to most aristocratic line- 
age away back in classic Greek and Latin. Literature 
repeats itself, as well as history, and everything else ; 
for they all come from the human soul, itself an eternal 
unity of variety. This bond between past and present 
may be illustrated by a few examples out of many. 

We moderns are not the first to find things which 
" make us tired," for Virgil, speaking doubtless from a 
rich personal experience, complains that " Juno makes 
earth and Heaven tired." His description of a city 
riot, in which he says " rocks fly," is twin brother to the 
reportorial railway strike, wherein coupling-pins always 

"fly." 

Cicero might have been a Roman from Cork, when 
he speaks of " a power of silver and gold " ; and he is 
forever " t'rowing Cataline out " (of the city). 

Caesar says that Ariovistus "had taken to himself 
such airs that he seemed unendurable." 

Our word " business," which is so convenient to piece 
out conversational poverty with more or less legitimate 
uses, is a prime favorite with both Cicero and Caesar. 
The following phrases are quite Chicagoese : " An op- 
portune time for finishing the business " (of destroying 
the enemy's fleet) ; " What business had Caesar in 
Gaul ? " " They undertook the business " (of arresting 
the Allobroges), etc. 

Xenophon gives us in Greek the same phrase as 
Cicero in Latin, for he says, " Tissaphernes threw out 
others " (of the refugees from the city) . He seems 
like an elder brother when he declares, " I made a 
find," and " They were like to wonder."

JUSTICE TO THE MODERN JEW.* 

Mrs. Frances Hellman's English translation 
of M. Leroy-Beaulieu's " Israel among the Na- 
tions " will doubtless be widely read in this 
country. The fame of the original work as the 
best, because the fairest, most searching, and 
most critical, study of what is vaguely styled 
and more vaguely known as the Jewish Ques- 
tion has preceded and paved the way for Mrs. 
Hellman's admirable version ; and there are 
just now obvious reasons why Americans espe- 
cially should wish to understand this Jewish 
Question, and to qualify themselves to judge 
of its possible bearing upon their own present 
and future. The main conclusion, probably, 
that the American reader will draw from M. 
Leroy-Beaulieu's book is the comfortable one 
that there is for us no Jewish Question the 
conditions which gave rise to that question and 
tend to perpetuate and inflame it in the Old 
World not obtaining here. Antisernitism and 
Jewish particularism are the outwardly dissim- 
ilar but really cognate blossoms of a tree for- 
eign to our soil, and unable, when transplanted, 
to flourish in our social and political atmos- 
phere. The Jew's troubles in the Old World 
and the chronic " Question " concerning him 
have been and are rooted in and bound up with 
his peculiar status a status primarily thrust 
upon him from without, and secondarily of his 
own creation. In every land in which for the 
past fifteen centuries the son of Jacob has 
pitched his tent he has been perforce the man 
without a country, the intruder, a stranger 
within the gates of the Gentile, in fine, the 
man of a race and a religion distinct from the 
dominant ones about him. Always isolated, 
usually threatened, and often persecuted, he has 
naturally tended (to quote an expression of 
Tolstoi) to curl back upon himself and retreat 
into the shell of his own exclusiveness. Given 
these conditions, and the Jewish Question arises 
of itself. In America the Jew is placed in a 
new environment. For the first time since he 
began his wanderings, he finds himself at home 
actually in a country he can call his own 
unchallenged, where his claim to citizenship is 
flawless, and where his blood and faith are nat- 
urally matters of relative indifference to a

Sons. 



mixed and cosmopolitan community. Our na- 
tional bond is neither racial nor religious, but 
the broader and humaner one of national con- 
sciousness ; and we have hitherto freely ex- 
tended the right of citizenship, with all that the 
term implies, to whomsoever comes to us be 
he Jew or Gentile, bond or free and says, as 
Ruth said to Naomi, " Thy people shall be my 
people." This the Jew has done ; and that he 
now comes to us largely a suppliant, with his 
hereditary gabardine rent and tattered by bit- 
ter blasts of race hatred and persecution, should 
not constitute his least claim upon our hospi- 
tality ; nor should the fact that he alone, of all 
our transplanted fellow- citizens, may in general 
be said to have left no fatherland behind him, 
and brought no ancestral patriotism with him, 
constitute the least warrant of his whole-hearted 
acceptance of his adopted country. A soil that 
has never been darkened by the walls of the 
Ghetto may well be doubly dear to him. For 
the oppressed Jew of Europe, the promised 
land lies no longer Jordanwards ; he turns his 
wistful gaze to the far West, to the shores of 
the new Canaan beyond the Atlantic, at whose 
portals stands Liberty with flaming torch light- 
ing the way for the oppressed of all nations. 
And this new promised land once reached, why 
should he need much time to become attached 
to it ? " It would not surprise me," says M. 
Leroy-Beaulieu, " if, on disembarking, those 
Jews were to feel like pressing their lips to the 
ground, as did their forefathers on reaching the 
Holy Land." If there is ever to be a Jewish 
Question in this country, it must be primarily 
the result of our own apostasy of our failure 
to maintain those sublime humanitarian prin- 
ciples which it is France's greatest glory to 
have first proclaimed to the world, and which 
the founders of the American Republic, touched 
with the optimism of their era and nerved by 
its faith in the intrinsic virtue and high terres- 
trial destinies of mankind/stamped freely upon 
their institutions and confidently left to the 
guardianship of posterity. Generous France, 
the France of Turgot and of Condorcet, first 
bade Ahasuerus "Rest"; despotic Russia, at 
the close of our nineteenth century, bids him 
take up his wanderer's staff anew. Pelted by 
the pitiless storm of a new persecution, he bends 
his steps westward ; and his almost pathetic 
readiness, when he reaches our shores, to be of 
us, to be like us, to master our ways and our 
tongue, and to respond like other men to the 
fusing influence of universal liberty and toler- 
ance, indicate that an American Jewish Ques-

tion, should it ever arise, will spring from a 
seed of our planting, not of his. 

Turning now to our author, let us glance at a 
few of his leading facts and positions ; and first 
as to the numbers and distribution of this Sem- 
itic remnant which is pointed out as the potent 
source of the evils that afflict modern society. 
There are at this period of Israel's greatest 
dispersal seven or eight millions of Jews scat- 
tered among five or six hundred millions of 
Christians and Moslems the Kussian Empire 
holding about one-half of all the Jews in the 
world. Surely the Son of Jacob, looking about 
him and noting the vast complexity of social 
phenomena ascribed to him as the efficient 
cause, may well say, with ^Esop's fly, " What 
a dust do I raise ! " Israel's centre of gravity 
is in ancient Poland, Russia, Roumania, and 
Austro-Hungary, this district forming a res- 
ervoir of Jews whose overflow, always tend- 
ing westward, is now vastly increased, and 
threatens to sweep old European and the young 
American states with a long tidal wave of Jew- 
ish immigration. As the numbers and import- 
ance of the Jews in western Europe increase, 
so does the prejudice against them increase. 
Hence has arisen Antisemitism a threefold 
conflict of creed, race, and class. Rooted in an- 
tiquity, and partly an atavistic trait, Antisemit- 
ism flourishes afresh under favoring conditions ; 
and, being cradled in the new empire of the 
Hohenzollern, it naturally " plays the pedant," 
proses learnedly from the Kathed&r^ and cov- 
ers its barbarous gospel of race-hatred with a 
modern scientific veneer. While religious an- 
tipathy of the vulgar sort counts for little in the 
movement, one of the main charges brought 
against the Jew is that he is the born enemy 
of " Christian civilization "; that he is at work 
through a thousand occult agencies, noiselessly 
sapping the foundations of the City of God, 
and undermining the fair fabric of Christian 
traditions and institutions. Antisemitism is 
thus the counterpart of Anticlericalism ; it is 
another Kulturkampf, this time instituted by 
the Clericals as a tactical manoauvre, in the 
heart of the struggle between the new Empire 
and the Romish hierarchy, against the foes of 
" Christian civilization." Sprouting from this 
germ, the tree of Antisemitism has spread and 
flourished until its baleful shadow has dark- 
ened western Europe the German-Ultramon- 
tane war-cry, " Make front against the New 
Jerusalem," being echoed widely in Protestant 
Germany, in Catholic France and Austria, and 
in orthodox Russia, until Catholic or Sectarian 



Slav, Latin, Teuton, and Magyar would seem 
to have united in this singular movement to 
put an end to what Antisemitism terms the 
" judaising " of European states and societies. 
Essentially, these vague and grandiose charges 
against the Jew amount to the sufficiently ab- 
surd one that he is the author as well as the main 
disseminator of what is termed the spirit of 
the age, of the modern practice of summoning 
belief to the bar of reason. That this charge 
is out of all accord with the facts of history 
let us add, with the real stature of the modern 
Jew is plain. That the rationalistic temper 
budded in the stifling atmosphere of the Ghetto, 
and that the spirit of free inquiry was cradled 
behind the bars of the Judengasse, is a propo- 
sition, one would think, to stagger even the 
trained credulity of a Pastor Stoecker ; and, as 
our author observes, it would surely have sur- 
prised Voltaire and Diderot to be told that they 
were only the unconscious agents of the Jews. 
Small wonder is it that the liberal Israelite, 
quick to discern his advantage, has ostenta- 
tiously accepted the reproach hurled at him 
from Lutheran pulpits and Russian tribunals, 
and decked his brow with it as with a garland. 
But let Israel be content with its matchless 
glory of having given to the world its religion, 
its Decalogue, its sublime ideal of human duty. 
One sees, indeed, many scientific Jews, but no- 
where a Jewish science ; and inquiry shows us 
that, in modern times, the Jew has been mainly 
receptive, not originative ; the broker of ideas, 
not the author of them. " Look at them," said 
a friend of the author, " see how quickly and 
with what squirrel-like agility they climb the 
first rungs of any ladder ; sometimes they suc- 
ceed in scaling the top, but they never add to 
it a single round." Without wholly accepting 
this disparaging estimate, may we not agree 
with M. Leroy Beaulieu that, in the main, the 
genius of the modern Jew lies in a certain unique 
facility of adaptation, a talent for grasping the 
varying gifts, of different races and blending 
them into an eclectic whole which is unlike each 
yet contains a tincture of all ? That there is 
in high and exceptional cases a new and unique 
flavor superadded, the lover of Heine, of Men- 
delssohn, or of Spinoza may well claim. But 
the origin of the modern world lay neither in 
the Jew nor in the Jewish spirit. " It was due 
to the spirit of analysis, of research, to the sci- 
entific spirit, whose first teachings came to us, 
not from Judea, but from Greece ; and though, 
at a later day, the Jews or the Arabs brought 
them back to us, they have none the less ema-

nated from the Greeks." In all the world there 
is no man more stubbornly conservative than 
the talmudic Jew ; and the new light that shot 
in a thousand prismatic rays of verse and prose 
from the " burning and far-shining spirit of 
Voltaire " penetrated with the utmost difficulty 
the chinks in the walls of Ghetto and Juden- 
gasse. Well may Jewish rabbis, viewing with 
sorrow the sceptical tendencies of their dis- 
persed flock, hurl back at the Gentile the charge 
of having secularized or " paganized " modern 
society, and say to him, as Nathan said unto 
David, " Thou art the man." The reply which 
the Russian novelist has placed upon the lips 
of the accused Lithuanian Jew may well be 
sadly repeated by many of the latter's co-relig- 
ion iste, in the West as well as in the East : 

" Our children have no longer our beliefs ; they do 
not say our prayers, nor have they your beliefs; no 
more do they say your prayers ; they do not pray at all, 
and they believe in nothing." 

Neither the distinctive merits, then, of mod- 
ern civilization, nor the defects of those merits, 
are of Jewish origin. Let us not reverse the 
roles of Jew and Gentile. 

" Despite the statements of certain Semites, or cer- 
tain Antisemites both tending equally to exaggerate 
the importance of Israel it is not the Jew who has 
emancipated Christian thought, but Christian thought, 
or, if you prefer, Aryan thought, that has emancipated 
the Jew. . . . Scepticism, nihilism, materialism, so far 
from being Jewish products, are, in the Jews infected 
by them, but a sign and a consequence of the closer union 
of races ; they bear witness to the contact of the Jew 
with ourselves." 

Then there is the National Grievance. Not 
content with de- christianizing his neighbors, 
the Jew, it seems, threatens to de-nationalize 
them ; and this, in our century, when national 
feeling counts for so much, is an unpardonable 
sin. In an evil hour for the sons of Abraham, 
there was discerned, at the bottom of the Jew, 
the Semite the natural antagonist of the 
Aryan, the blood-foe of that precious deutsche 
Kultur complacently held by the naive philoso- 
phy of history of an ultra-Teutonic school to be 
the nurse and mother of modern civilization. 
This profound discovery made, and a weak 
point in the lines of the liberal attack present- 
ing itself, the signal for a new Judenhetze was 
sounded summoning the defenders of German- 
enthum to make front against Judenthum. The 
slogan sounded in Germany soon found, as we 
have seen, an echo beyond her borders ; and 
once more the ominous cry " Hep ! Hep I " or 
its modern euphemism, warned the startled Jew 
of his old fatal status as a stranger the root 
of every charge brought against him since the 



Babylonian captivity. Antisemitism decks itself 
and hides its vulgar origin with the specious 
theory of a pinchbeck social philosophy ; and 
at the heart of this philosophy one detects the 
old tribal notion that identifies nationality with 
race. 

It is urged that " since every nation is 
founded on unity of race, and since the Jews 
are a separate race, they can never belong to 
any nation." Confronted at this primitive 
stage of his argument with the fact that not a 
single modern nation, not even Germany, can 
justly lay claim to unmixed blood, to a national 
basis of race-unity, the Antisemitic philoso- 
pher widens his concept, and urges that, after 
all, these superficially diverse ethnic elements 
constituting modern nations are really homo- 
geneous elements, rays diverging from a com- 
mon centre, branches of the noble Aryan oak. 
But is it true that none but Aryan elements 
have entered into the composition of modern 
nations ? What of the underlying strata of Eu- 
ropean pre-historic races of Cro-Magnon or 
of Neanderthal which must have been sim- 
ply covered over, and not obliterated, by Indo- 
European deposits? 

" Nothing warrants the belief that we are all Aryans; 
the Frenchman or the German who prides himself on 
his pure Indo-Germanic blood, may have descended 
from the cave-dwellers. In fact the existence of an 
* Aryan race ' at the present time is perhaps as purely 
imaginary as the existence of a ' Latin race.' " 

Again, what becomes of this notion of a 
sharp and antagonistic confrontation of Jew 
and Aryan upon which Antisemitic theory 
depends, when we consider that, while it is 
certain that alien blood, pagan or Christian, 
flows freely in Jewish veins, it is also certain 
that Christian nations have, on their side, a 
marked strain of Jewish blood? Shem and 
Japhet, supposed to be incapable of blending, 
have already blended. There is probably not 
a single modern nation that is quite free from 
admixture with the Semite ; while some of 
them, like Spain and Portugal, have absorbed 
so much Jewish blood that they have become 
" completely impregnated with it." Germany 
is not exempt ; and an ironical destiny may 
have so ordered it that the Teutonic current in 
the veins of indignant Pastor Stoecker himself 
is faintly perfumed with thefastor Judaicus. 

" Israel has been like an island whose borders, swept 
by the waves, have crumbled piecemeal into the ocean, 
until more than once it seemed threatened with com- 
plete submersion. Of all the descendants of Jacob, only 
a small part, perhaps even only an infinitesimal minor- 
ity, has remained faithful to the religion of its fathers. 
The great majority of the twelve tribes have accepted

the yoke of the Cross; they have long since become 
merged in us; the waters of baptism have swept them 
out among the nations of the world. We Christians 
can never be sure that we do not number among our 
ancestors some unrecognized Northern or Southern 
Jew." 

We cannot here follow further M. Leroy- 
Beaulieu's elaborate argument, nor even glance 
at his interesting chapters on the Physiology, 
the Psychology, and the Genius of the modern 
Jew. His views are by no means always flat- 
tering to the latter ; but they are always broad, 
well-considered, and based on the freest and 
fullest scrutiny of facts. One point upon which 
he constantly insists, and which may be per- 
haps taken as the key-note of his eloquent plea 
for a humaner view of the Jewish Question, 
is the truth that the Jew of to-day that is, the 
Jew of the marked type generally objected to 
is what he is largely because of the life we 
have so long forced him to lead. The virtues 
which we accuse him of lacking could scarcely 
have blossomed under the rod of persecution. 
If he is the child of the Talmud, he is none the 
less the child of the Ghetto ; and it is to the 
latter parent that most of his objectionable 
traits may be traced. Antisemitism has little 
chance even of a hearing in this country, as 
recent events have proved we trust to the sat- 
isfaction of Herren Stoecker and Ahlwardt. 
To us, we believe it is no idle boast to say, the 
most " philosophical " Antisemite is simply a 
Jew-baiter with a doctrine ; and the only part 
of that doctrine with which we need concern 
ourselves is refuted by our daily experience of 
our Hebrew fellow-citizens. E G j^ 



THE MEDUEVAL, UNIVERSITIES.* 

Dr. Rashdall has written a good book on a 
great subject. The origin, growth, constitu- 
tion and government, the ideals and studies, 
students and teachers, relations and influence, 
of the universities of the middle ages, are 
themes that can never lose their interest for 
educated men. With beginnings so obscure 
that they are likely to remain a subject of con- 
troversy, growing up in ways that often defy 
the most learned and acute minds to explain 
them, encountering all sorts of difficulties and 
dangers both within and without, and marked 
by the characteristic facts of their time and

ford College, Oxford. In two volumes. Oxford: At the

country, these institutions at once so far met the 
higher needs of men for the present, and so far 
adapted themselves to changing conditions, that 
they attained to the greatest usefulness and in- 
fluence in medieval times, and continued into 
the modern era. In his very first paragraph, 
Dr. Rashdall shows that he grasps the dignity 
of his theme. 

"Sacerdotium, Imperium, Studium are brought together 
by a mediaeval writer as the three mysterious powers, or 
' virtues,' by whose harmonious cooperation the life and 
health of Christendom are sustained. This Studium ' 
did not to him, any more than the ' Sacerdotium ' or the 
' Imperium ' with which it is associated, represent a 
mere abstraction. As all priestly power had its visible 
head and source in the city of the Seven Hills, as all 
secular authority was ultimately held of the Holy Ro- 
man Empire, so could all the streams of knowledge by 
which the Universal Church was watered and fertilized 
be ultimately traced as to their fountain-head to the 
great universities, especially to the University of Paris. 
The history of an institution which held such a place in 
the imagination of a mediaeval historian, is no mere sub- 
ject of antiquarian curiosity; its origin, its development, 
its decay, or rather the transition to its modern form, 
are worthy of the same serious investigation which has 
been abundantly bestowed upon the Papacy and the 
Empire." 

In his preface the author briefly refers to 
the origin and growth of his book, describes 
his ideal or plan, and indicates the sources of 
his materials and the extent of his obligations 
to others. Like many other works of English 
scholarship, this book originated in a univer- 
sity prize essay, which was won in 1883. At 
first the author intended nothing more than 
such a revision and expansion of the essay as 
would justify its publication in book-form ; but 
he continued his labors until twelve years were 
gone, and his essay had been expanded into 
1400 octavo pages. His plan is " to describe 
with tolerable fulness the three great archetypal 
universities Bologna, Paris, Oxford and 
to give short notices of the foundation, consti- 
tution, and history of the others arranged in 
national groups." Even of the three great uni- 
versities, he does not profess to have written a 
history. Referring to the others, he says : 

" The condensed treatment of seventy-three univer- 
sities in 316 pages has of course rendered that part of 
my work of little interest, except for purposes of refer- 
ence ; but to have ignored all but the most famous Stu- 
dio, would have left the reader with a very inadequate 
impression of the extent and variety of the mediseval 
university system, and of the importance of the part 
which it played in the making of civilized Europe. 
Moreover, it would have been impossible to write satis- 
factorily the history of even one university without an 
acquaintance with the documents of all the rest. The 
great defect of university histories has been the non- 
application of the comparative method. As matters

stand, even students will probably skip the greater part 
of Vol. II., part i. The general reader will perhaps 
find most that will interest him in Vol. II., part ii." 

Volume I. opens with a discussion of the 
question, What is a University ? This is fol- 
lowed by a longer chapter on Abelard and the 
Renaissance of the Twelfth Century. Then 
come a few pages devoted to Salerno, which in 
university history is little more than a great 
name. An extended chapter of 180 pages is 
devoted to Bologna, and Paris fills out the vol- 
ume. The universities of Italy, Spain, France, 
Germany, Bohemia, and the Low Countries, of 
Poland, Hungary, Denmark, and Sweden, and 
of Scotland, comprise the 316 pages described 
by the author in the quotation given above. 
Volume II., part ii., is devoted principally to 
Oxford, but it contains also an account of Cam- 
bridge, and two other chapters of a general 
character. For Dr. Rashdall's sources, we can 
only refer the reader to his preface and numer- 
ous bibliographies and notes, adding merely 
the remark that he must have spent his twelve 
years industriously to have explored so much 
material. 

The reader who is not already familiar with 
the main facts stated in the first chapter will 
find it necessary to make them at once his sure 
possession. The notion that a university means 
a school in which all branches of knowledge 
are taught " has long since disappeared from 
the pages of professed historians." " A glance 
into any collection of mediaeval documents re- 
veals the fact that the word ' university ' means 
merely a number, a plurality, an aggregate of 
persons." In the earliest period in which the 
word is used in a special sense, " the phrase is 
always ' university of scholars,' ' university of 
masters and scholars,' ' university of study,' or 
the like." 

" It is particularly important to notice that the term 
was generally in the middle ages used distinctly of the 
scholastic body, whether of teachers or scholars, not of 
the place in which such a body was established, or even 
of its collective schools. The word used to denote the 
academic institution in the abstract the schools or the 
towns which held them was Studium, rather than Uni- 
versitas. . . . The term which most nearly corresponds 
to the vague and indefinite English notion of a univer- 
sity, so distinguished from a mere school, seminary, or 
private educational establishment, is not Universitat 
but Studium Generate; and Studium Generate means, 
not a place where all subjects are studied, but a place 
where students from all parts are received. Studium 
Generate became common at the beginning of the 13th 
century, when it was used as vaguely and indefinitely 
as the English term Public School or the German Hoch- 
Schule." 

The name now implied three characteristics 



" (1) That the school attracted, or at least invited, stu- 
dents from all parts, not merely those of a particular 
country or district; (2) That it was a place of higher 
education, that is to say, that one at least of the higher 
faculties, theology, law, medicine, was taught there ; 
(3) That such subjects were taught by a considerable 
number, at least by a plurality, of masters." 

How the meaning of the name fluctuated, how, 
progressively, it became more definite, and how, 
finally, it disappeared, giving place to univer- 
sity, it would take too much space to tell even 
in the fewest words. 

Most persons who read books of this class, 
if not indeed all of them, will find themselves 
constantly falling upon surprises. Dr. Rash- 
dall himself has found a closer acquaintance 
with the facts resulting in " a certain disillu- 
sionment." " We have often had occasion to 
notice," he remarks in his epilogue, "that 
features of the mediaeval university system 
which have constantly been appealed to as 
binding precedents were really less universal 
and less invariable than has been supposed." 
The following extract shows what he means, 
and also teaches us to beware of pushing gen- 
eralizations too far : 

" The University of London, after being empowered by 
Royal Charter to do all things that could be done by any 
University, was legally advised that it could not grant 
degrees to women without a fresh charter, because no 
university had ever granted such degrees; we have seen 
that there were women-doctors at Salerno. We have 
been told that the mediaeval university gave a religious 
education; we have seen that to the majority of students 
it gave none. We have been told that a university must 
embrace all faculties; we have seen that many very 
famous mediaeval universities did nothing of the kind. 
That it eventually came to be considered necessary, or 
at least usual, that they should do so, is due to the event- 
ual predominance of the Parisian type of university 
organization, minus the very peculiar and exceptional 
absence of a Faculty of Civil Law. We have been told 
that the collegiate system is peculiar to England; we 
have seen that Colleges were found in nearly all univer- 
sities, and that over a great part of Europe university 
teaching was more or less superseded by college teach- 
ing before the close of the mediaeval period. We have 
been told that the great business of a university was 
considered to be liberal as distinct from professional 
education; we have seen that many universities were 
almost exclusively occupied with professional education. 
We have been assured, on the other hand, that the 
course in arts was looked upon as a mere preparatory 
discipline for the higher faculties; we have seen that 
in the universities of Northern Europe a majority of 
students never entered a higher faculty at all." 

Different readers will find different parts of 
the book most instructive and interesting. We 
have taken a special interest in the chapters 
and sections of a more general character. " The 
Place of the University [of Paris] in European 
History," "The Studies of Oxford," "The

Studies of Paris," " The Place of Oxford in 
Medieval Thought," "Student Life in the Mid- 
dle Ages," are titles that illustrate what we 
mean. 

In a short chapter entitled " The Numbers 
in the Mediaeval Universities," Dr. Rashdall 
attacks the traditions that assign thirty thou- 
sand students to Oxford, and corresponding 
numbers to Paris and Bologna, when those uni- 
versities were at the summit of their greatness. 
Valuable data for such a purpose are far from 
abundant ; inference must largely take the place 
of registration lists ; but we can see no good 
reason to dispute the general soundness of his 
conclusions, which will be presented in his own 
words. 

" (1) It is improbable that the numbers of either 
Bologna or Paris can ever have exceeded some 6000 or 
7000. At Paris at least it is pretty certain that this limit 
was approached during its period of highest repute 
say, the beginning of the fourteenth century. (If all the 
grammar-boys of the city were added, we should pos- 
sibly have to add some 2000 more.) About the middle 
of the fifteenth century, however, the number at that 
university was probably nearer 3000. In Italy the 
growth of new universities was so rapid and extensive, 
and the decline in the reputation of Bologna so serious, 
that neither Bologna nor any one of its rivals can ever 
have approached the numbers of Paris after an early 
period of the thirteenth century. 

" (2) The maximum number at Oxford was some- 
thing between 1500 and 3000. By about 1438 the num- 
bers had fallen to under 1000. 

" (3) The numbers of Prague before the German 
migration in 1409 may have been 3000 or more; Vienna 
and Leipsic may at one time have had 1000 or 2000. 
The numbers of the other German universities during 
the fifteenth century varied between 100 and 1000, in- 
cluding grammarians. 

" (4) We may add that the population of other minor 
universities in France and elsewhere, wherever ascer- 
tainable, is always numbered by hundreds and not by 
thousands; at Toulouse alone there may have been as 
many as 2000." 

The most serious defect of Dr. Eashdall's 
book is the omission at the close of a summary 
view of the whole field. No doubt such a chap- 
ter would have been a peculiarly difficult one to 
write. Still, it would have given a unity and 
completeness to the work that it now lacks, End 
should have been written. But even as it is, 
the work is incomparably the most valuable one 
dealing with the subject in our language, and 
will at once take its place in libraries, public 
and private, as a recognized authority.

THE HISTORICAL, DEVELOPMENT OF 
ELECTRICITY.* 

The demand for popular scientific literature 
having to do with electricity and magnetism has 
of late been prodigious. A great deal has been 
written to gratify a love for the mysterious and 
sensational, or, on the other hand, to supply a 
little information that might immediately be 
turned to practical purposes. Much of this 
popular writing has been indifferent and of but 
slight value to general readers. The technical 
literature of the subject has been too severely 
scientific and mathematical either to interest or 
profit any except specialists. Electricity in its 
manifold applications is the dominant scientific 
feature of the age ; and yet to the large body of 
thoughtful readers the subject is one shrouded 
with an air of mystery, because so little under- 
stood. The great magazines and periodicals, 
with rare exceptions, seem to avoid the subject, 
not, probably, from lack of interest, but rather 
on account of inseparable technicalities. This 
difficulty is oftener fancied than real, for there 
is much connected with electricity which is sug- 
gestive and filled with absorbing interest. The 
subject only requires humanizing to arouse a 
more intelligent interest in its historical devel- 
opment as a preparation for understanding its 
existing applications. This, Dr. Park Benja- 
min's book on " The Intellectual Rise in Elec- 
tricity " is eminently fitted to do. It is a book 
that will prove a most welcome addition to the 
library of every thoughtful reader. 

This book marks the beginning of a new 
epoch in the literature of electricity, and shows 
that the science has far transcended the sup- 
posed period of its infancy ; for to the extent 
the literature of any science becomes philosoph- 
ical, it approaches the perfection of its develop- 
ment. The layman can scarcely appreciate the 
narrowness of the electrical profession. The 
marvellous development of the applications of 
electricity has scarcely permitted time for phil- 
osophical thought to be directed toward either 
its history or its broader relations. No science 
has ever been so exacting, or had so little to 
do with the strictly material. Devotion to it 
has meant absorption with mere technical de- 
tails. The writer who has presumed to tran- 
scend petty technicalities, and to introduce gen- 
eral conceptions or philosophical allusions, has 
been called irrelevant, unpractical, and out of 
touch with the times. The purely intellectual

[Feb. 1, 



possibilities of the subject have scarcely been 
dreamed of or imagined, and few have pos- 
sessed the courage to attempt to utter them. 
But all this bids fair to be changed, and the 
" Intellectual Rise of Electricity " to receive a 
new impulse. What is urgently needed is that 
laymen acquire such a knowledge of electricity 
as will make its history, the general scientific 
elements underlying the science, living reali- 
ties ; that its devotees rise to broader apprecia- 
tion of literature, history, and philosophy. 

"From the inception of the study of natural phe- 
nomena, the human mind has pursued its development 
along two well-defined lines. At first a phenomenon is 
a mere matter of observation, of sensation ; then, as its 
perception strengthens, the attempt is made to turn the 
occurrence to some practical application, without seek- 
ing to incorporate it into a generalization. This may 
be called the pre-scientific attitude. The true scientific 
spirit develops when the mind passes from mere observa- 
tion to classification, and then on to the higher realm of 
search for causes, for laws. It was when the light- 
nings burst from the clouds and the thunders shook the 
earth that the human mind was awed before the mys- 
terious and uncomprehended powers of nature. In the 
childhood age of the race, the mind saw in such events 
only the manifestation of the terrible powers of su- 
pernatural beings, which the superstitious revered as 
gods to be appeased with sacrifices and placated with 
prayers." * 

The task Dr. Benjamin has addressed himself 
to is to entangle the mingled threads of fact 
and fancy, of mythology and history, and reveal 
the birth of the electrical idea, its growth, and 
tell how later on it blossomed and bore rare 
scientific results. Nor has the author placed a 
false estimate on the value of his subject, when, 
in the Introduction, he says : 

" The intellectual rise in electricity is worthy of his- 
torical investigation, not merely because of the material 
results, actual and potential, which have come from it, 
but because it shows clearly anew the marvellous power 
of the human mind as an instrument of discovery, capa- 
ble of correcting its own errors. Beginning with a sin- 
gle phenomenon, afterwards including effects, all for 
long periods seemingly fortuitous and uncorrelated, 
this rise has involved questions of an interest second 
only to that which mankind has yielded to the great 
issues of life and eternity; questions which challenged 
the human understanding and compelled it to measure 
itself against them." 

The story of the amber and the magnetic 
stone is often repeated in classic lore, and is so 
interwoven with early thought that the history 
of development from these simple facts to the 
dynamo, the telegraph, and the trolley of to- 
day, involves very largely the various stages of 
progress of intellectual growth in general. So 
the author defines the spirit in which he wrote, 
when he says : 

*Albrecht, Getchichte der Elektricilat. 



11 In this research I have felt that it is not so much 
the trials and discoveries made in the great and new 
field of Nature which attract us, instructive and useful, 
even momentous, as they are, not these so much as the 
breathing human beings, who in the far past saw them 
and deciphered them in the light of those other days, 
and of whose light they formed a part; who thought of 
them, and whose thoughts lived on, and became immor- 
tal, and moved downward through generation after gen- 
eration, to us; even as our thoughts, joining theirs, will 
pass through the ages to the generations yet to come." 

Electricity as a science is fully matured, and 
is in no sense in its infancy, except that the 
extent of its possible applications is just be- 
coming realized. Its essential definition, full 
of poetic fancy at first, has now become as 
clearly defined as our notions of gravity and 
of the nature and constitution of matter. We 
speak of electricity to-day as an ether-stress, 
an expression full of meaning to those who 
have thought far enough to grasp its signifi- 
cance. But what a progress from the concep- 
tion of an " amber soul " to " ether-stress " f 
Yet in the interval of time which marks this 
progress, all the intellectual and political his- 
tory of the human race can be written. In- 
stead of being in its infancy, electricity is 
really the oldest of sciences, since possibly the 
first recorded experiment in natural science 
was the electrification of a bit of amber. The 
word electricity comes from the Greek names 
applied to amber, and the significance of this 
term is singularly appropriate. To the poetic 
fancy of the Greek, the amber-gold, elector, was 
an embodied sunbeam. From the amber the 
name passed to a property possessed by it 
that of attracting light bodies ; and now, by a 
most singular coincidence, the imprisoned sun- 
beam energy of coal is released to furnish the 
brilliant arc light, and we still name the agent 
electricity. 

The earliest mention of the electrical prop- 
erty of amber is mostly legendary, and whether 
the property was first discovered by genius or 
accident may never be definitely known. Yet 
it is especially interesting, in these latter days, 
whn women are struggling for fuller recogni- 
tion, to learn that in all probability the discov- 
ery of electricity was due to a woman. The 
Thracian women used amber spindles when 
spinning thread, and these were called " clutch- 
ers," because dust and light substances were 
attracted by them after having been rubbed 
against the garments. 

The lodestone, or natural magnet, has an 
equally interesting history, and a no less ob- 
scure origin of discovery. The simple phe- 
nomena of the magnet and amber were doubly

mysterious to the ancients ; both possess a 
strange power of attraction and repulsion, and 
these tendencies are selective, the amber for 
light bodies only, the magnet affecting naught 
else but iron or its like. Did not such action 
partake of the nature of an intelligence, and 
to what else could it be ascribed than the pres- 
ence of a soul in amber and lodestone ? In such 
attraction and repulsion they recognized both 
Love and Hate, and it becomes easily appar- 
ent that the " Intellectual Rise " here chron- 
icled has touched upon the profoundest con- 
cepts of philosophy. 

A potent charm for the cure of all manner 
of bodily ills was thought to reside in the magic 
amber and lodestone. From the times of the 
Samothracian priests, the medical quack has 
flourished and fattened on the credulous faith 
of people in the miraculous healing power of 
magnetic and electric belts, rings, pills, and 
so on through the list of traps for the unwary. 
It is a singular fact that both in the develop- 
ment of electricity and chemistry the first prac- 
tical application was made in the attempted 
healing of bodily ills. It is difficult to explain 
the vitality of the belief in the healing efficacy 
of magnetism and electricity. This persistence 
certainly is no argument for the healing-power 
of such devices, but is rather evidence of the 
persistence of superstition and belief in dia- 
bolism. 

The passage from poetic speculation to a con- 
crete science did not occur until the close of the 
sixteenth century. In this change, the names 
of Gray and Gilbert stand as landmarks. Bacon, 
Galileo, Hooke, and Boyle, all contributed to 
gather the grains of fact from what had hitherto 
been so largely legendary. Other bodies were 
found to possess the attractive power of amber 
under favorable conditions. Substances were 
divided into electrics and non-electrics, and the 
behavior of such under excitation was studied. 
Magnetic phenomena were carefully studied. 
Later, Otto von Guericke discovered how to 
generate considerable quantities of static elec- 
tricity by a rubbed sulphur globe ; and von 
Kleist was as much dismayed by the shock that 
marked the discovery of the Leyden jar, as the 
world was surprised. Then electrical experi- 
ments became the fad, and monks, nuns, cour- 
tiers, and soldiers were repeatedly and indis- 
criminately shocked. A rich vein of humor 
runs through the descriptions of these times. 
The medical quack took fresh courage, and 
plied the gullible public with vigorous activity. 
We read of the marvellous cures of a certain 



Flemish physician, Van Helmont, who worked 
wonders with the " Balsamick Emanations of 
the Sympathetick Unguent or Powder." Mag- 
netic remedies abounded, which were famed for 
curing even at great distance. Here we note 
the rise of the conception of communication at 
a distance by magnetic or electric means. Tel- 
epathy was firmly believed in, and one may 
readily discern the beginnings of modern hyp- 
notic suggestion in those times. 

But even at that period a wonderful idea was 
slowly taking form in the minds of the more 
thoughtful. Men began to dream of transmit- 
ting intelligence through space, germs of 
thought which have developed into the electro- 
magnetic telegraph and telephone. A great 
generalization remained to be established, the 
identity of the electric spark with the lightning ; 
and with this master-stroke of Franklin the 
chronicle of " The Intellectual Rise in Elec- 
tricity " comes to an end. The final lesson of 
the author is worthy of note : 

" Man-made systems may fall, apostles of degenera- 
tion may find, in the things which make up the environ- 
ment of the hour, signs of impending decay. But he who 
turns to the history of intellectual endeavor in the study 
of nature will learn that when mind thus faces the pu- 
rity of the Infinite, it does not and cannot degenerate. 
Rather will he see in the constant effort to reveal the 
truth an influence always making for good, always 
neutralizing the tendency to evil, always vast in uplift- 
ing power." 

Dr. Benjamin has done his work well. He 
has brought to his task the scientific training 
of the specialist in electricity, the resources of 
a private library considered without an equal 
in the country, and a literary style that is both 
elevated and charming. The work is free from 
mathematics and technicalities, and is as en- 
tertaining as a romance. ^ jy 



THE CAVE-DWELLERS or YUCATAN.* 

The examination of the earth accumulations 
upon the floors of caves in Europe has given im- 
portant evidence to the archaeologist. Ancient 
men used the caverns as homes, and in them 
are found to-day layers and heaps of rubbish 
that accumulated during this occupancy. Bones 
of animals that were used as food, rude tools 
and implements, charcoals of ancient fires, are 
among the objects found. From their evidence 
it is known that in France and England man 
was contemporaneous with the mammoth, the

woolly rhinoceros, the cave-bear, the reindeer, 
creatures now extinct, or found only in dis- 
tricts remote from these ; that man in Western 
Europe was at first a savage, with the crudest 
tools and weapons ; that he was capable of pro- 
gress, and that he made improvement, the steps 
in which may be traced. All this has been 
clearly proved. 

Comparatively little careful exploration has 
been made of American caverns. What has 
been done is quite largely the work of Mr. 
Henry C. Mercer, who has recently studied 
caves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, 
Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The results 
are interesting and important, but cannot be 
presented here. The exploration of these caves 
suggested investigation of those of Yucatan. 
Everyone knows of the curious ruins left in that 
peninsula by the Mayas. A strange culture 
is shown by them and by the relics found with 
them. Was this culture indigenous, growing 
up in Yucatan itself, or was it introduced in 
full development ? Mr. Mercer believed that 
an examination of the caves would solve the 
question. Fortunately, means for the enter- 
prise were not wanting. Mr. John White Cor- 
with offered the funds for the investigation, 
and with Mr. Mercer and a small party of help- 
ers spent some months last year in the field. 
The results of the trip are presented in Mr. 
Mercer's volume on " The Hill Caves of Yu- 
catan." 

The physical geography of Yucatan is at once 
peculiar and simple. The country is largely 
one of limestones, and these are almost honey- 
combed with subterranean channels and cham- 
bers. Of high mountains there are none ; a 
low ridge was the mass in which lay the caves 
examined. It presented no cliffs or rock walls. 
Caves like those of France and England, of 
Tennessee and Pennsylvania, do not seem to 
exist there. Those found are described as 
" A very striking class of underground chambers from 
fifty to three hundred and fifty feet in diameter and 
from fifteen to seventy feet high, more or less brightly lit 
by round openings in the ceiling ten, twenty, and fifty 
feet in diameter. Through these skylights fragments 
of the original crust had fallen, forming piles of loose 
stones on the cave floor. . . . Where the rock pile was 
high enough, banana trees and tropical evergreens grow- 
ing upon it swept the brink of the chasm with their 
boughs, making strange rattlings when the wind blew. 
Sometimes the subterranean groves lay far beneath the 
surface in rotundas inaccessible from above. Then they 
were first seen after a long clamber underground, like 
gardens beneath the vaultings of sombre passages. 
Doves built their nests in high ledges by the skylights, 
and animals found refuge under the rock heaps, where 
Indians had built blinds of loose stones to stalk them." 



Such were the caves to be examined. The 
work was often difficult. The fallen rock 
masses were frequently so numerous, so large, 
and so closely packed, that the excavation had 
to be abandoned long before the original floor 
of the cave was reached. It was soon evident 
that these caves had never been to any great 
extent either homes or burial places. But for 
all that, they contained the evidence sought. 
Yucatan has little surface water, few streams, 
and no great rivers. But underground water 
abounds, and these caves contain a fairly full 
and reliable supply. Man to-day comes to them 
for water, and he must have done the same 
ever since the peninsula has been inhabited. 
Never living here continuously, he has always 
been a frequent visitor and camper. Though 
relics are neither as abundant or varied in the 
earth-layers upon these floors as they are in the 
French caves, they occur, and are ample. 

Twenty-nine caves were visited. " Thirteen 
had archaeological significance ; six yielded val- 
uable, and three decisive, results." The excava- 
tions at Oxkintok, Loltun, and Sabaka showed 
a single layer of rubbish, consisting of pots- 
herds, stone tools and weapons, charcoal, and 
bones of animals and birds, some of which had 
served as food. The objects found do not 
indicate vast antiquity, do not prove the co- 
existence in Yucatan of man and extinct 
species of animals, do not show a progress in 
culture. 

In closing his study, Mr. Mercer arrives at 
three conclusions, which may be stated in his 
own words : 

" First. That no earlier inhabitant had preceded the 
builder of the ruined cities in Yucatan. 

" Second. That the people revealed in the caves had 
reached the country in geologically recent times. 

" Third. That these people, substantially the ances- 
tors of the present Maya Indians, had not developed 
their culture in Yucatan, but had brought it with them 
from somewhere else." 

These conclusions appear justified by the evi- 
dence. It is now desirable that similar studies 
should be made in Central and Southern Mex- 
ico, and in Guatemala and other parts of Cen- 
tral America. Mr. Holmes's interesting study 
of " Early Man in Mexico " appears to show a 
progressive culture in the Valley of Mexico, 
and legends of Nahuatl and other tribes tell of 
successive populations in various portions of 
the Isthmian Area. Examination of caves in 
the regions suggested, such as Mr. Mercer has 
made in Yucatan, might yield most valuable 
results.

SOME PHASES OP THE SCIENCE OF MIND.* 

Different in subject and scope as are the five vol- 
umes included in this review, an important bond of 
community between them is none the less apparent ; 
and this consists of their common bearing upon the 
rigorous study of mental phenomena, that forms one 
of the striking features of contemporary thought. 
For, apart from the anatomists, zoologists, and phy- 
siologists, who are enlarging the facts and interpret- 
ing the results of their own specialties as a self- 
sufficient and independent pursuit, there exists a 
body of students ready to take up so much of these 
data as can be utilized in the exposition and inves- 
tigation of psychological problems. And what is 
true of the relations between the sciences that deal 
with the body and those that deal with the mind, is 
true, though in different ways and degrees, of an- 
thropology and philology, of psychiatry and sociol- 
ogy. Indeed, we may be said to have completed 
the circle of the sciences, beginning with the days 
when all knowledge was one, and that one philoso- 
phy, and slowly developing to the formation of the 
several sciences into independent groups ; and now 
realizing, in the light of this vast accumulation of 
fact-material, the essential interrelation and inter- 
dependence of the many specialties. The various 
sciences represent the directions of our interests 
and the limitations of each man's powers, quite as 
much as they represent groups of facts naturally or 
logically separated from other groups of facts. 

Professor Donaldson's work on " The Growth of 
the Brain " is devoted to a systematic and discrim- 
inating account of the growth-changes in the nerv- 
ous system, accompanying and forming so essential 
a factor of the march from birth to death. To give 
this account its maximum significance, the introduc- 
tory chapters describe the main factors of cell and 
body growth ; and for the proper comprehension of 
the bearing of these changes, a clear and telling 
exposition of the architecture and function of nerve 
tissues is introduced. The volume thus does more 
than it promises, for it gives the facts of brain- 
growth a carefully wrought and attractive setting.

Our knowledge of the nervous system has recently 
progressed quite rapidly, but the records of the pro- 
gress are difficult of access in scattered papers and 
technical journals, and require the elimination of 
contradictory data and accidental variations before 
their significance is revealed. So readable and at 
once so scholarly an account of the essential facts 
of neurology, embodying these recent advances, is 
itself an important acquisition to the literature of 
the subject. 

It is in the results of the main problem under dis- 
cussion that the reader will probably be seriously 
disappointed ; he will find it difficult to carry away 
any very definite conclusion regarding brain changes 
and individual variations in brain structure. He 
appreciates the interpretation of the several tables 
of comparisons of cranial capacity and the like ; he 
realizes the many sources of error and chances for 
misinterpretation and loose inferences in the treat- 
ment of the subject for these are clearly set be- 
fore him ; but he cannot escape the suspicion that 
the positive outcome of the discussion, though not 
to be ignored, is none the less disappointing. For 
this he must blame, not the author, but the present 
condition of the subject. It is in many ways an 
unfortunate time to attempt the grouping of the 
facts into an orderly whole, and particularly to pre- 
sent them in a form suitable for a semi-popular 
scientific series. The many tables and curves, the 
cautious preliminary discussions and careful consid- 
erations of sources of error, it is to be feared, will 
deter the layman, while calling out the admiration 
of the fellow specialist. Pioneer work is necessa- 
rily unsatisfactory from an artistic point of view. 
A quarter of a century hence the time may be riper 
for the preparation of such an essay on the growth 
of the brain as the average reader may desire, but 
will not find in the present volume. However, 
although the keystone will be the most conspicuous, 
the other stones are quite as essential to the strength 
of the structure. 

Before leaving this volume, we must give a mo- 
ment's notice to its sub-title " a study of the nerv- 
ous system in relation to education." The growth- 
changes of the nervous system are obviously funda- 
mental in all that process which we call education ; 
and in the last two chapters of the work, the edu- 
cational bearings of the whole are ably set forth. 
It is true that these educational applications are 
based as much upon other facts as upon those treated 
in the volume, and even more so ; but they tell very 
plainly the lesson that neurology teaches. They 
show how apt we are to exaggerate the importance 
of formal education and technical acquisition, and 
how slight this may be when compared with uncon- 
scious absorption and the unfoldment of natural 
dispositions ; they show that no discussion of the 
effects of educational methods can be considered 
complete that does not take into account the changes 
in the nervous system by which all such processes 
are conditioned. Our knowledge of such relations 
is lamentably imperfect in detail, but the attempt 



74 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



to interpret educational changes in neurological 
terms is in itself most helpful, and gives additional 
importance to the volume under discussion. 

Professor Wilhelm Wundt is widely known to 
English readers as a pioneer and a leader in the 
development of modern psychology and as the foun- 
der of the first laboratory for the experimental study 
of mental phenomena ; yet the present is the first 
volume of his writings to appear in an English trans- 
lation. These lectures on "Human and Animal 
Psychology " were first published over thirty years 
ago, being one of the very earliest contributions to 
the experimental field ; in 1892 the author revised 
and rearranged the older lectures, and from this 
second edition Professors Creighton and Titchener, 
of Cornell University, have prepared their transla- 
tion. Of all of Professor Wundt's writings, this vol- 
ume is best suited for translation, because it is 
adapted to a wider reading public, and covers, in a 
less didactic and detailed manner than his more 
formal treatises, the chief problems of mental sci- 
ence. The first group of lectures considers the facts 
and interpretation of sense-impressions. The dis- 
cussion of the measurement of intensities of sensa- 
tion and of the methods of gaining a knowledge of 
space-dimensions are particularly fully and inter- 
estingly treated. A second group of chapters takes 
up the time-relations of mental phenomena, consid- 
ering the rapidity of mental processes, the range 
of consciousness, the fluctuations of attention, the 
nature of associations, and the like. Besides the 
lectures which treat of the nature of animal activi- 
ties, there are also discussions of abnormal states, 
dreams, hypnotism, and allied phenomena ; of the 
development of the will and its relation to reflex, 
automatic, and expressive movements ; of the funda- 
mental theories connecting bodily and mental states ; 
and more less incidentally of a variety of interest- 
ing psychological problems. 

It is thus apparent that the lectures cover a very 
wide range ; but there is little attempt to give the 
various topics a definite setting in a coordinated 
general conception. In each of the groups of prob- 
lems considered, a few problems are selected as 
typical, and are treated with considerable detail, 
their relations to other almost equally important 
topics being left without notice. This defect is per- 
haps to be ascribed to the lecture form of the work, 
but will often leave the general reader at sea re- 
garding the significance of what he has read. 
Indeed, the reader to whom the volume will be most 
helpful is one who has some elementary acquaint- 
ance with scientific psychology, and is willing to 
make some effort to extend that acquaintance, and 
at the same time demand a readable and impressive 
exposition. This class of readers does not include 
the largest share of those who will be tempted to 
scan the title-page with a view of perusal, but it is 
large enough to sanction the labors of translation ; 
nor should the demands of the rapidly increasing 
number of professed students be ignored. 

The revision of a course of lectures prepared in 



the budding-time of an expanding science could 
hardly have been an easy task ; and the result, as 
the author confesses, is not free from the architec- 
tural defects and compromises inherent in the mod- 
ernizing of an old structure. Distinctly new topics, 
that have come into prominence within recent years, 
are introduced ; other lectures are omitted ; and 
very generally new facts and experiments are sub- 
stituted for the old ones. But in spite of all these 
changes the volume does not adequately represent 
the methods and results of the movement to which 
Professor Wundt has so largely contributed. Wel- 
come as the volume undoubtedly is as an addition 
to the psychological shelves of our libraries, private 
and public, it must be recommended with an explan- 
ation of its relative historical importance, and of the 
plan of its modernization. 

The translation is both readable and accurate 
qualities not so often combined as to need no com- 
mendation ; here and there the harsh Teutonic tech- 
nical phrases are insufficiently disguised, or unusual 
words used when more familiar ones are in vogue. 
But these minor imperfections entirely disappear in 
the general excellence of the whole. 

Professor Ktilpe's " Outlines of Psychology " is a 
product of the Leipzic school of psychology ; the 
author was for several years an assistant to Profes- 
sor Wundt, and dedicates the volume to his master. 
It is in some respects a compendium of Wundt's 
larger work the resemblances of arrangement and 
treatment, of theory and perspective, being many 
and striking, but in the main deserves to be re- 
garded as an original exposition of psychological 
problems from the experimental point of view. It 
is to be regretted that the author has not availed 
himself of the convenience of a preface to explain 
the special purposes of the volume, the class of read- 
ers to whom it is addressed, and the basis of selec- 
tion of the particular problems selected and omitted. 
The " psychologies " of an earlier period were mostly 
expositions of individual systems, or the tenets of a 
school ; more recently a " psychology " has come to 
represent the particular group of problems, treated 
from this or that point of view, in which the author 
is specially interested. It may be seriously ques- 
tioned whether the progress of a science depending 
upon such contributions alone would be rapid or 
certain. It would be foolish to question the right 
of any scientific worker to express his own convic- 
tions upon the main problems of his science in a 
way most satisfactory to himself, and, indeed, a 
frank acknowledgement of this individualistic mo- 
tive upon the title-page would often ward off a 
severe but justifiable criticism of the work ; but 
from the point of view of a disinterested zeal in the 
advance of science it may be confidently maintained 
that a general discountenancing of such works would 
be a wholesome corrective to a natural excess. 
Many a work of ability, and replete with expositions 
of originality and importance, repels rather than 
attracts, because it is entitled " principles " or " out- 
lines " of psychology, instead of " some contribu-

tions to the consideration of selected problems in 
psychology." The matter is not one of title, of 
course (and unwieldy titles are obviously objec- 
tionable); it is a question of the wholesomeness of a 
certain literary tendency that is particularly pre- 
valent in psychology. 

Professor Kiilpe's work is an able example of the 
tendency in question. It represents more than any- 
thing else his individual interests and methods of 
exposition ; able as these are, and interesting as they 
may be to his fellow-theorizers, it may be doubted 
whether they will appeal to that considerable body 
of English-reading students for whom the transla- 
tion was presumably prepared. The work is not 
easy to read nor to describe. To the collegiate stu- 
dent of psychology it will be quite generally puz- 
zling and unsatisfactory ; although the claim is made 
that " experimental psychology is fully within its 
rights when it claims to be the general psychology 
of which we propose to treat," it is surprising how 
few experimental results are described ; unusual 
technical terms and needlessly abstruse classifica- 
tions are constantly introduced. In brief, it is a 
work much better suited to the German than to the 
English mind ; our education demands more atten- 
tion to guidance and instruction than is traditional 
in the academic freedom of a German university. 
We reap the benefit of this in the pains taken by 
our professional writers to be clear and useful. 

The work is divided into three parts, devoted 
respectively to the elements of consciousness, the 
connection between these elements, and the general 
considerations of states of consciousness. Under the 
first head, sensations are considered, first with refer- 
ence to their quality or specific character, and then 
with reference to their intensity. We ordinarily 
restrict the term sensation to the process that be- 
gins with the action of some agency outside our- 
selves and makes us aware of such stimulus ; for 
this, Dr. Ktilpe prefers the term " peripherally ex- 
cited sensation," and treats of the processes of 
memory, imagination, reproduction, and association 
as " centrally excited sensations." A final section on 
the elements of consciousness is devoted to the feel- 
ings, with some slight reference to the will. The 
" conscious elements " are connected mainly in two 
ways : by fusion, illustrated best by the mingling of 
several tone-stimuli into one sensational effect ; and 
by colligation, which finds its best instance in the 
method of our deriving a knowledge of space from 
the combination of touch, movement, and sight. 
The terms " fusion " and " colligation " are used so 
broadly that a consideration of the emotions and 
impulses, of the perception of time and space, of the 
many variations of simple and compound reactions, 
of the phenomena of contrast and optical illusions, 
are all made more or less pertinent to the discus- 
sion. The part dealing with the states of conscious- 
ness discusses attention, self-consciousness, sleep and 
dreams, hypnotism and allied conditions. As already 
indicated, the treatment gives least space to the 
description of facts, and dwells fully upon interpre- 



tations, analysis, and the merits of rival theories. 

Considering the character of the work, the trans- 
lation is more than creditable ; an elimination of 
technical terms and unusual phrases and the didac- 
tic arrangement would have been a departure from 
a literal version, but a relief to the English reader. 
But in consideration of the recent contributions to 
our literature of similar scope, it may be doubted 
whether the translation meets any real need. 

Mr. Stanley's essay on the psychology of feeling 
is a noteworthy and original contribution to a much- 
discussed but obscure problem the origin, signifi- 
cance, and course of development of the emotional 
activities and dispositions. The author's contention, 
as implied in his title, is that the feelings prompt- 
ing to and accompanying actions can be rightly 
interpreted only in the light of an evolutionary hy- 
pothesis and under the principle of serviceability. 
This at once emphasizes the problem as one belong- 
ing to comparative psychology, and sends the stu- 
dent to studying the simpler emotional capabilities 
of children and of the lower animals. On the other 
hand, Mr. Stanley is convinced that the typically 
psychological method is introspection, that feeling 
can be known only by a discriminating and self- 
observant feeler ; in this method, therefore, the first 
place is given to a rigid self-analysis, the results of 
such analysis to be controlled and corroborated by 
observation of less complex personalities than our 
own, as well as of the various historical, social, and 
anthropological variations which the study of man 
furnishes. 

The beginning of all mental life is in the pleasure- 
pain feelings ; these precede cognition, the primi- 
tive organism realizing that its psychic state is dis- 
turbed before it is aware of a something causing the 
disturbance. Indeed, the incentive to cognition is 
the feeling ; " pleasure and pain bring their objects, 
not objects pleasures and pains." Of the two, al- 
though both primitive modes of manifestation, pain 
is perhaps the earlier. Both appear because of their 
serviceability in advancing the good of the organ- 
ism and protecting it from evil, and both develop in 
the line of more and more efficient and far-seeing 
benefit and protection. 

" Further, that pain should be attained where there is 
little actual harm, is good, but to attain pain, and self- 
conservative action before any injury is done, but only 
about to be done, is better. Reaction to potential harm 
is a most important advantageous step. In the earlier 
form of mentality, the animal must actually be in the 
process of being devoured by an enemy before a pain 
reaction is achieved, but in the later representative form 
of reaction there is complete anticipation, and the ani- 
mal can come off with an absolutely whole skin. Ideal 
pains, as fear, anger, and other emotions, are gradually 
substituted for pains which are real in the sense that 
they arise in a positive hurt to the life of the organism. 
The saving which is effected through emotion is most 
important, and this economy is reason for the rise of 
emotion in the strugle of existence. Those animals who 
are able, not merely to react on slight injuries to them- 
selves, but also through fear, etc., to avoid all actual 
injury, have a very manifest advantage."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



As forewarned is forearmed, as experience brings 
wisdom, as the power of prediction is the test of 
science, so the same prudential and anticipating 
advantages furnish the clue for the development of 
the emotions. Fear and desire, repulsion and 
attraction, the avoidance of evil, the seeking of good, 
bring about opposite pairs of emotions, gradualy 
differentiating into more and more forms with the 
increased complexity of the animal organization 
and environment, until in man we have all shades 
and grades of fear emotions, requiring the trained 
powers of an astute observer for their analysis and 
delineation. The portrayal of these differentiations 
of fear and desire, of surprise, hope, dissappoint- 
ment, of anger and despair, make up the central 
portion of the volume, and do not admit of a sum- 
mary statement. 

Mr. Stanley is equally forcible and felicitous in 
his treatment of more complex and peculiarly hu- 
man emotions, as in his analysis of the simpler feel- 
ings common to all living kind concerned in the 
struggle for existence. His analysis of the aesthetic 
and the ethical feelings the two most difficult 
chapters in the psychology of feeling which are 
certain to arouse objections in the minds of many, 
cannot but be suggestive and stimulating to all; 
and in particular the chapter on the " Psychology 
of Literary Style " is cordially recommended to 
students of literature as well as of psychology as 
an attractive bit of psychological analysis. 

Mr. Stanley's views will incite criticism at the 
hands of those who have maintained different views 
of the significance and origin of feeling notably 
in this country of Profesor James and Mr. Mar- 
shall; and his general method will be opposed some- 
what by the claimants for the introduction of ex- 
periment and objective tests throughout the psy- 
chological field. The former will find much food 
for reflection in this evolutionary exposition of the 
subject; and the latter, while convinced that the 
author underestimates the possibilities of experi- 
ment in psychology, will probably admit that its 
application to the emotions is most difficult, and 
will be ready to admit introspection as a legitimate 
method when it is used, as it is in this volume, with 
discrimination, with a recognition of its many 
sources of error, and under the guidance of a mental 
habit formed by familiarity with scientific thought. 

The last volume in our group furnishes an addi- 
tional example of an all too frequent discrepancy 
between title-page and content. The reader, hav- 
ing his appetite aroused by an attractive menu, is 
perhaps unduly annoyed at finding a very simple 
meal, quite wholesome and palatable in itself, but 
very different from what he was led to expect. Had 
Mr. Hoffman entitled his essay " Contributions to 
the study of American picture-writing," he would 
have attracted a more limited public, but would 
have fed this public to its satisfaction. The essay 
touches the fascinating problem of the origin and 
growth of sign-making frequently, but in an irregu- 
lar and unsystematic manner. This problem is fun- 



damentally a psychological one, involving the sur- 
vival of the best-suited modes of communication 
under various primitive conditions, the necessity of 
communication being in turn an outcome of the 
social impulse. The typical forms of sign-making 
must therefore correspond to typical modes of asso- 
ciational and other mental processes ; of these, sym- 
bolism is perhaps the most interesting and most 
efficient. Mr. Hoffman's grouping of signs involv- 
ing this and similar processes is valuable and help- 
ful ; and in general it may be said that the more 
limited purpose of the volume the illustration of 
the principles of sign-making by American picto- 
graphs is successfully accomplished. As such, the 
volume will be welcomed by a rapidly increasing 
number of students and general readers who are 
convinced that the proper study of mankind is man.

the Obscure " known as " Hearts Insurgent " dur- 
ing the period of its publication in a popular maga- 
zine is a book sure to command much attention, 
and to provoke widely diverse expressions of opin- 
ion. When engaged in reading the opening pages, 
it seemed to us that the book bade fair to equal, if 
not to surpass, any of the author's previous achieve- 
ments. There is always something supremely touch- 
ing in the story of a boy of high aspirations and 
exceptional intellectual endowments, struggling up- 
ward to the light under conditions the most adverse, 
and this is the story outlined for us in the begin- 
ning of the book. But as our reading went on, and 
the twilight of the opening chapters deepened into 
the gloom of those that followed instead of flushing 
into the dawn that we had reason to expect, as the 
youth who at first aroused sympathy developed into 
the man who could inspire little besides contempt 
or disgust, as the book became more and more a 
bitter tirade against the fundamental institutions of 
society, and as we realized that its tenor was to re- 
main one of cheerlessness throughout, we must con- 
fess to a feeling of utter disheartenment at the use 
which the author was set upon making of his splen- 
did talent. Ours is not the childish complaint of 
the reader who wants his stories to come out well ; 
we do not dispute the right of tragedy to a con- 
spicuous place in the literature that deals with the 
stern realities of human life, and we are more than 
most writers in sympathy with the moods of the 
pessimist. But between the noble tragedy which 
performs for us the Aristotelian function of purging 
the soul of baseness and such tragedy as Mr. Hardy 
gives us in the present novel, between the proud 
pessimism of a revolted but self-centred spirit and 
the scolding sort of pessimism to which this book 
gives vent, there is a world-wide difference. The 
one is as attractive as the other is revolting to the 
reader of serious temper. The author tells us that 
his book " attempts to deal unaffectedly with the 
fret and fever, derision and disaster, that may press 
in the wake of the strongest passion known to hu- 
manity." Fret and fever he doubtless gives us, and 
both derision and disaster, but to say that he does 
it unaffectedly is the last thing that would occur to 
a reader of wholesome instincts. On the contrary, 
it would be uncharitable not to assume that the 
gratuitous cynicism, and the sullen temper, and the 
moral perversity of the book, were all affected, de- 
liberately and of set purpose. It cannot be, for 
example, that Oxford is indeed to Mr. Hardy the 
city of dreadful night that his Christminster is made 
to appear. To the childish imagination of Jude it 
appeared as a very city of the soul, and the chap- 
ters that present it to us in this aspect themselves 
belie the other chapters in which it takes on so dif- 
ferent a guise. As for the plot of the novel, any 
outline statement would appear merely farcical ; with 
the wealth of observation and episode brought to 
the working-out, it escapes this charge, although 
but narrowly. In characterization it is, of course, 
strong beyond most contemporary novels, and Sue 



is a creation of a charm so elusive yet irresistible 
that she is secure in the affections of the reader, 
although her kaleidoscopic nature is inconsistent far 
beyond the point to which inconsistency as the pre- 
rogative of her sex is admissible. The book is also 
a very plain-spoken one, more than necessarily plain- 
spoken, we think. Will these realists leave nothing 
to the imagination in dealing with the subject which 
above all others makes a decent reticence imperative? 
Mr. Ruskin once wrote of Browning in these 
terms : " The worst of it is that this kind of con- 
centrated writing needs so much solution before the 
reader can fairly get the good of it." Mr. Mere- 
dith's style calls for solution quite as much as 
Browning's ever did, and does not so well reward 
the patience. Whatever may be the insight or the 
robust philosophy of his books, their utterly per- 
verse manner must exclude them from the vital 
literary interests of the great majority of readers. 
This is unfortunate, for Mr. Meredith has better 
stuff to offer us than any of his contemporaries 
among novelists, but it is nevertheless inevitable. 
The rich kernel of his thought is encased in too 
hard a nut for many to crack, and his doctrine is 
likely to remain chiefly esoteric. " The Amazing 
Marriage " is not as hard reading as some of its 
predecessors have been, but is harder than most of 
us like to undertake for pleasure. Between this 
book and Kant's " Kritik," let us say, it is some- 
thing like a toss-up, with the chances a trifle in favor 
of the sage of KOnigsberg. We do not profess to 
have read every line of these two thick volumes, 
but we have caught glimpses in their pages of sev- 
eral intensely-realized individuals, and have as often 
wished that the author might have presented his 
characters with the lucid art of a Balzac or a Thack- 
eray, instead of as in a glass darkly, straining the 
gaze and thwarting the attention. Considered sim- 
ply as a story, the book has but a slender equip- 
ment. An impulsive and eccentric young noble- 
man meets an unconventional girl, and proposes to 
her on the spot. He soon regrets the act, while she, 
never doubting his sincerity, holds him to the word 
which he makes it a point of strenuous honor not 
to evade. The wedding is accomplished, and the 
bride is taken, for her wedding-journey, to a prize- 
fight, described with ghastly exactitude. Immedi- 
ately thereafter the husband deserts her, but can- 
not escape the spell cast over him by her proud and 
vital personality. The rest of the book is devoted 
to a description of the process of soul-subjugation 
to which the hero finally succumbs, only to be 
flouted, and to find that he has cast irrevocably 
away a jewel too cheaply prized. She leaves the 
scene upon some mad errand of mercy to the Span- 
ish rebels, and he finds refuge in a monastery. An 
obtrusive person called Dame Gossip interrupts the 
narrative from time to time, and an equally obtru- 
sive Old Buccaneer, sometime father of the heroine, 
is permitted to bore us every now and then with 
certain maxims left at his death to a wondering 
world.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



One of the most noteworthy features of recent 
English fiction is the revival of interest in the Scot, 
due in part to the writings of Stevenson and Mr. 
Lang, and still more largely to the still later group 
of writers that includes Mr. Barrie, Mr. Watson, 
and Mr. Crockett. Of these three, the latter, to 
judge by what has already been accomplished, rep- 
resents the greatest fertility of invention, as well as 
the most marked literary force. Two recent novels 
by Mr. Crockett appeal to us, as their predecessors 
have done, by their faithful delineation of scene 
and character, their romantic manner, and their 
shrewd humor. Both are human books in a high 
sense, and both enlist the sympathies of the reader, 
holding them to the end. " A Galloway Herd " is 
a story whose scenes are mainly Scotch, although 
predetermined by certain tragic happenings in Lon- 
don, and ending, almost tragically, in the Paris of 
1871 and the Commune. The passages are some- 
what loosely linked together, and one is often puz- 
zled to trace the connection between scene and scene. 
This lack of explicitness is doubtless a fault, as is 
also the intrusion of certain romantic elements not 
quite in keeping with the tenor of the narrative. 
The dialect, too, is a stumbling-block, and makes 
hard reading of far too many pages. That the book 
should, on the whole, compel attention to the end, 
in spite of these shortcomings, is perhaps the best 
tribute that we can pay to its essential charm. We 
should add that the book is an early production, 
now reprinted without the author's sanction. 

" The Men of the Moss-Hags," Mr. Crockett's 
other novel, is " a history of adventure taken from 
the papers of William Gordon of Earlstoun in Gal- 
loway." It deals with the persecution of the Cov- 
enanters, and has many a stirring episode of con- 
flict, and imminent danger, and escape. It is, in- 
deed, open to the reproach of being little more than 
a series of episodes, and its charm is to be sought in 
the faithful finish of its separate scenes rather than 
in the action taken as a whole. The dialect, too, 
makes it difficult reading, but that is a necessary 
evil in a tale of this sort, and we gladly put up with 
the strange speech for the sake of the local color 
and sympathetic delineation. The closing episode 
makes no small demand upon credulity, but the 
story, taken altogether, is not lacking in verisimili- 
tude, and the author has so thought and felt him- 
self into the period of which he writes that we are 
more than once reminded of Scott, without for a 
moment thinking of Mr. Crockett as an imitator. 

Another Scotch story wholly Scotch as to scene, 
and largely so as to character is Mrs. Steel's " Red 
Rowans." The writer herself frankly styles it " a 
love story," and the name is accurately applied. It 
must have necessitated a sharp readjustment of fo- 
us for the writer to turn to another country from 
the India that she knows so well, and a book like 
the present is the last that we should have expected 
from the author of "The Potter's Thumb." In 
some respects the art of "Red Rowans" marks 
an advance upon that of the Indian tales, an advance 



most notable in the matter of construction, although 
in this respect Mrs. Steel has still something to 
learn. We cannot forgive the tragically abrupt 
ending of the story, for the whole tenor of what 
goes before does anything but warrant so startling 
a conclusion. One is almost tempted to think that 
it was adopted in sheer despair, and because a nat- 
ural solution of the complication was found too dif- 
ficult. The story is, in the main, a wholesome piece 
of work, excellent in both description and charac- 
terization. If it has not the extraordinary power 
of " The Potter's Thumb," it is probably because 
its theme is too hackneyed and commonplace to per- 
mit of a like display. But, in any case, the histo- 
rian of our latter-age fiction will have to reckon 
with Mrs. Steel. 

The unfamiliar name of " Aubrey Lee " is at- 
tached to the story of " John Darker." The book 
is an exceedingly amateurish performance, with but 
scant display of constructive skill or rather an 
exasperating absence of it where most needed 
and concerned with people whose characters are so 
self-contradictory that we soon give up the attempt 
to reconcile their curious traits. Yet there is a cer- 
tain crude power in parts of the book that arrests 
attention, and sustains a certain degree of interest. 
It is more than accident that the writer makes oc- 
casional reference to Charlotte Bronte, for many 
passages suggest the peculiar temper of the author 
of " Jane Eyre," and the heroine (who uses the first 
person) succeeds in making herself almost as real 
as her other characters are impossible. The sum 
of it all is that the writer must be a young woman, 
who has had some personal experiences out of the 
common, who has preserved an unusually vivid rec- 
ollection of them, and who has thrown her person- 
ality unreservedly into her pages. 

Mr. Boothby has hardly done well to desert, even 
in part, the Australasian scenes hi which his earlier 
novels have been placed, and " A Bid for Fortune " 
is weakened by being made to cover so much ground. 
It opens with a mystery so well conceived as to 
stimulate the most jaded interest, and speedily de- 
velopes into a promising love-story. But the love- 
story ends in insipidity, and the mystery appears 
too much for its inventor, since he fails to clear it 
up, although he calls hypnotism and other uncanny 
agencies to his aid. The plot is for the most part 
wildly improbable, if not impossible, and the book 
can hardly be called anything better than rubbish 
of a rather clever sort. 

" The Chronicles of Count Antonio " is an ex- 
periment in mediaevalism, and the author has been 
fairly successful in the task of investing his narra- 
tive with the romantic atmosphere of the Italian 
life of some centuries ago. A petty state, its rul- 
ing prince, a noble maiden, and a valiant outlaw, 
are the materials out of which this somewhat la- 
bored book is made. We must confess to having 
found it dull reading, with hardly a trace of the 
sort of romantic interest that the author contrived 
to put into " The Prisoner of Zenda," for example. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

The nature of the subject, of course, precludes the 
introduction of the element of comedy that gives 
zest to such other books as " A Change of Air " and 
*' The Indiscretion of the Duchess," and that makes 
those books so effective. 

The recent revival of interest in the Maid of Or- 
leans has resulted in the production of a consider- 
able amount of romantic fiction, of which the most 
important example is Mr. Lang's " A Monk of 
Fife." The subject is one almost ideally suited to 
Mr. Lang's hand, appealing, as it does, to his deepest 
interests and intellectual sympathies how warmly 
the noble poem in his latest volume of verse may wit- 
ness. The romance before us pretends to be a transla- 
tion of a French manuscript in the Ilatisbons Scots 
College. Whether this pretense be wholly a bit of 
mystification we are not concerned to inquire ; for all 
practical purposes " A Monk of Fife " is an original 
work of Mr. Lang's imagination, although it follows 
historical fact more closely than such fiction is wont 
to do. As to the style of the book, it may be de- 
scribed in Mr. Lang's own words, as " not imitating, 
in manner, the almost contemporary English of the 
* Paston Letters,' or the somewhat earlier English 
style of the Regent Bedford, but merely attempt- 
ing to give a moderately old air to his [Mr. Lang's] 
version of a French which, genuine or imitative, is 
certainly, in character and spelling, antique." The 
story is told in the first person, and is essentially 
the narrative of a young Scotsman, fleeing from his 
own country in consequence of a brawl, and finding 
service with the French at such a time as to be con- 
cerned in the siege of Orleans, and to become 
closely associated with the fortunes of the Maid. A 
pretty love-story after the fashion made so famil- 
iar by the author of " A Gentleman of France " 
runs through the chronicle, and gives it an extra- 
historical interest. The narrative is at times la- 
bored, as the result of a wish to omit no historical 
fact of importance, but is for the most part highly 
readable, giving a vivid impression of the stirring 
life of early fifteenth-century France. 

It is to the France of a later period than this, 
of a period later even than that with which he has 
been in the habit of dealing, that Mr. Weyman 
takes us in " The Red Cockade." The hackneyed 
theme of the French Revolution has for a time, and 
that not altogether happily, diverted the author's 
attention from the ages of Henry IV. and of Riche- 
lieu in which he has shown himself so entirely at 
home. The present story is confined within the 
first year of the Revolution, and its scene is in the 
provinces. At first, it pictures the peasant uprisings 
of the summer and autumn of 1789 ; then the hope- 
less stand taken by the clerical party at Nimes the 
year following becomes the subject of the story, 
bringing it to an effective climax. It is the conven- 
tional and melodramatic view of the Revolution that 
Mr. Weyman gives us, a view that will not bear 
very close historical examination, but that is, of 
course, highly effective for romantic purposes. It 
does not seem, to us, however, that this book is as 



well planned and carefully written as two or three 
of its predecessors. The illustrations leave much 
to be desired ; most of all, perhaps, that the artist 
should have read the text with which he was sup- 
posed to be working. It is a little startling to read 
of the heroine, at a certain critical juncture, that 
her hair was falling loosely over her shoulders, and 
to note the elaborate coiffure given her in the cor- 
responding picture. 

The selection of American fiction made for the 
present review cannot better be headed than by the 
name of Mr. Bret Harte, who this year gives us of 
his largess two full-grown romances. " Clarence " is 
a sequel to " Susy," and reintroduces us to Clarence 
Brant, this time as a Union officer in the Civil War. 
The plot is based on the estrangement between him 
and his wife, resulting from the pronounced South- 
ern sympathies of the aforetime Widow Peyton, and 
leading somewhat tragically to her death. Another 
heroine is introduced to console Clarence in his be- 
reavement and make him happy at the end. Our 
old friend Susy appears once more, as saucy and 
bewitching as ever, and plays an important part in 
the fortunes of the hero. The story is certainly 
one of the best that have been written with the his- 
tory of our Civil War for a background. Mr. 
Harte's other novel, " In a Hollow of the Hills," 
must, we fear, be reckoned among his comparative 
failures. It would impress a reader unfamiliar with 
the bulk of the author's work as striking enough, 
but to the one who views it against the background 
of so many earlier performances of its kind, the 
hackneyed character of the material is only too ap- 
parent, while it displays, in exaggerated form, the 
author's weakness for situations that are made start- 
ling only at the sacrifice of probability. Its kalei- 
doscopic changes are not easy to follow, or to con- 
nect into a coherent work of art. 

Mr. Townsend, to whom we are all indebted for 
the discovery and introduction to polite circles of 
Chimmie Fadden, has essayed, in " A Daughter of 
the Tenements," the conventional novel form, and, 
if a good plot, close familiarity with the scenes and 
types depicted, and genuine human sympathies are 
the elements of success in such an effort, the author 
has certainly achieved it. His plain, almost blunt, 
style savors of journalism rather than of literature, 
but affords just the medium needed for a vivid real- 
ization of the sort of characters with which he has 
chosen to deal, and whose life, both internal and 
external, he knows so intimately. In a word, Mr. 
Townsend offers us realism of a good kind, and de- 
serves our gratitude. His heroine is a very win- 
some young person, his hero is a fine example of 
manhood, and his villain is as despicable as the 
properly -behaved villain ought to be. Even the 
ward politician has, it appears, a human side, and 
is not altogether deserving of the sweeping condem- 
nation bestowed upon him by self-righteous critics. 
If we must find some fault with Mr. Townsend's 
story, it shall be that it is crowded toward the close, 
and leaves us with a feeling that the threads of a 



80 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



rather complex entanglement have not been straight- 
ened out with sufficient deliberation. Mulberry 
Bend, alas, is no more, but this novel will preserve 
the memory of that famous slum, and, what is still 
better, will help the student of the future to recon- 
struct not a little of its variegated and character- 
istic local color. 

" Dolly Dillenbeck " is not the story of a maiden, 
as might be inferred, for Dolly is short for Adol- 
phus, and the name is borne by a gilded youth who 
runs through his fortune in an incredibly brief pe- 
riod, and, after a season of convivial companionship 
with as disreputable a collection of deadbeats as 
Broadway can furnish, ends his wretched career in 
an asylum. He becomes successively famous as a 
" wine-opener," a society-newspaper publisher, and 
a " putter-up " for an actress, before his final dis- 
appearance from the scene, and his story becomes, 
in the clever hands of Mr. James L. Ford, a me- 
dium for the presentation of a good deal of cutting 
satire, and a number of rapid and realistic sketches 
of metropolitan types of character. The book does 
not introduce us to any very desirable society, yet 
the total impression is not as unpleasant as might 
be expected from this description, a fact largely due 
to the flashes of genuine humor that light up the 
pages of the narrative. 

" Rose of Dutcher's Coolly " is a most uncom- 
promising title, and seems to symbolize an unneces- 
sarily stern insistence upon the particular form of 
realism or veritism of which Mr. Hamlin Garland 
has so often made himself so outspoken and unami- 
able a prophet. The title introduces, moreover, a 
novel characterized by several noticeable defects, 
such as an obtrusive didacticism, a repulsive lack of 
reticence concerning those details of the sex prob- 
lem that it should be the first principle of whole- 
some art to avoid, and a style that is often slovenly. 
We may illustrate the latter defect by such sen- 
tences as, " Rose received a note from her asking 
her to come over and see her," and " I would be a 
literary if I were not forced to be a newspaper 
man," which are examples taken almost at random. 
Of the other defects noted, we may say that the very 
nature of one forbids any attempt at illustration on 
our part, while the other is familiar enough to read- 
ers of the author's earlier imaginative work. But 
we are happy to say that Mr. Garland's novel is a 
better one than his theories would rationally account 
for, that the wanton nastiness of a few chapters does 
not prevent the book as a whole from exercising a 
singular power over the reader's imagination, and 
that the faulty style is in part, at least, offset by 
some striking word-painting of the impressionist 
sort, and by a vivid presentation of the vital mo- 
ments in the life of the heroine. At times, as in 
the chapter called " M*son talks on marriage," or 
in the strong description of a storm on Lake Mich- 
igan, the reader ceases to be critical, and frankly 
gives himself up to delight in the display of genuine 
characterization, or poetic observation, as the case 
may be. The story centres about the life of a sin- 



gle person a girl who by sheer force of genius 
rises out of an adverse and benumbing environment 
to shape for herself spiritual freedom. The delinea- 
tion of this character is warmly sympathetic, and 
displays a degree of insight nothing less than re- 
markable. It is in the creation of this character 
that Mr. Garland has achieved his success, a more 
notable success, to our mind, than anything to be 
found in his earlier books. And he may indite 
essays in iconoclasm by the score if he will only now 
and then, by way of proving his quality, project into 
our fiction a few more Roses by any other name 
hailing from Dutcher's Coolly or other localities 
of cacophonous designation. 

" The Red Badge of Courage " is a book that has 
been getting a good deal of belated praise within 
the past few weeks, but we cannot admit that much 
of it is deserved. There is almost no story to Mr. 
Crane's production, but merely an account, in rough- 
shod descriptive style, of the thoughts and feelings 
of a young soldier during his first days of active 
fighting. The author constructs for his central char- 
acter a psychological history that is plausible, but 
hardly convincing. We do not know, nor does the 
writer, that it is what actually does go on in the 
mind of a man who is passing through his baptism 
of fire. It may be retorted that we do not know 
any the more that Count Tolstoi is giving us the real 
thing in his war-stories, or "Stendhal" in the 
" Chartreuse de Parnie," but the descriptions in 
these books at least seem inevitable while we are 
reading them, and Mr. Crane's descriptions do not. 

" A Singular Life " is perhaps the strongest piece 
of work yet done by the author of " The Gates Ajar." 
It is marred by the note of hysterical emotion, from 
which none of Mrs. Ward's books is quite free, and 
parts of it read too much like the unrestrained out- 
pourings of the revivalist or " temperance " lecturer. 
But it has a fine simple theme to build upon that 
of a clergyman who seeks to live the life of Christ 
rather than expound the doctrine by which theology 
has so successfully obscured the essential Christian 
spirit and the idea is worked out in fairly sym- 
metrical form. In one aspect, the book might be 
described as a tragic dramatization of the Andover 
Controversy ; in another, as the story of an Amer- 
ican Brand, devoting himself single-hearted, like 
his Norwegian prototype, to the work of saving 
souls. 

The main impression made by Miss Dougall's 
new novel is that the author has tried to make too 
much of a single slender idea. What might have 
been an admirable short story of thirty pages has 
taken the shape of a rather tedious long story of 
some three hundred pages. The religious motive 
is not lacking in this any more than in Miss Dou- 
gall's other books, but the " Question of Faith " sug- 
gested by the title is not a religious question at all, 
being nothing more than a question of the amount of 
faith that a man should repose in the woman whom 
he expects to make his wife. There is room for 
casuistry in the treatment of such a subject, but the

author avoids using it, and presents her problem in 
a direct and matter-of-fact way that can admit of 
but one solution. When the end is reached, it seems 
as if a great deal of trouble has been taken to set- 
tle a very simple matter, and the sense of disap- 
pointment is inevitable. 

We will bring this already overgrown article to a 
close with some mention of the two most important 
of recent translations of foreign fiction. Herr 
Drachmann, who is foremost among the living story- 
tellers of Denmark, makes his first appearance be- 
fore an English public with a pretty idyllic tale dat- 
ing from his earlier period. " Paul and Virginia 
of a Northern Zone," put into English by the late 
T. A. Schovelin, with the aid of Mr. F. F. Browne, 
is a charming addition to our collection of transla- 
tions from the fiction of the Scandinavian countries. 
The story has the freshness, if not naiveti, that 
gives to so many of the products of Scandinavian 
fiction their peculiar charm, and is so well exem- 
plified in the writings of Herr Lie. The work dates 
from the author's earlier period, before he went the 
way of nearly all the moderns and began to write 
about problems. Its publication should be followed 
by other translations from Herr Drachmann, whose 
place in contemporary Danish literature is a high 
one, if not the highest. 

The transition from romantic idealism to "ten- 
dencious " realism, that has marked the career of 
such Northern writers as Herr Drachmann, Herr 
Lie, Herr Bjornson, and Dr. Ibsen, is equally no- 
ticeable in the strongest contemporary writers of 
Southern Europe. It may be illustrated for this 
occasion by the " Dona Perfecta " of Senor Galdds, 
now translated by Mrs. Serrano. Mr. Howells, from 
whose mintage we cheerfully accept the needed 
word "tendencious" (tendenciosoin Spanish), writes 
an introduction to the translation, saying, among 
other things, the following : " Up to a certain time, 
I believe, Galdds wrote romantic or idealistic novels, 
and one of these I have read, and it tired me very 
much. It was called ' Marianela,' and it surprised 
me the more because I was already acquainted with 
his later work, which is all realistic." But Mr. 
Howells does not admit that the author of " Dona 
Perfecta " has undergone complete conversion, and 
sorrowfully adds : " I am not saying that the story 
has no faults ; it has several. There are tags of 
romanticism fluttering about it here and there ; and 
at times the author permits himself certain old- 
fashioned literary airs and poses and artifices, which 
you simply wonder at. It is in spite of these, and 
with all these defects, that it is so great and beauti- 
ful a book." We are quite disposed to admit that 
the book is both great and beautiful, although not 
exactly for the reasons advanced by our critic with 
a hobby. We should say rather that the book has 
these qualities because its author has had the ro- 
mantic training, and has kept to its essential method 
while at the same time gaining a firmer grasp upon 
the actualities of life. The religious bigotry of the 
provinces is the central theme of this remarkable 



story, and the problem is attacked in the bitterness 
of spirit that comes from close familiarity with a 
phase of life quite as characteristic of an Iowa vil- 
lage as of a Spanish town. The universality of the 
problem makes the book far more than a local study, 
and gives it a place among the half-dozen best works 
of modern Spanish fiction.

imaginary portraits ^ is art of a peculiarly delicate and 
of Sir Thomas More sympathetic kind by which a modern 
and his family. wr it e r is able not only to show us 
how to understand the past, but also to show us how 
the past understood itself. Walter Pater and Rob- 
ert Browning have special gifts for painting these 
imaginary portraits ; but humbler writers, by a fic- 
tion of memoir or correspondence or journal, have 
also succeeded in drawing the great heroes as their 
contemporaries may be thought to have seen them. 
" The Household of Sir Thomas More," a work first 
published about the middle of the present century, 
belongs among the best things of this kind, although 
the author's name, by her own choice, has remained 
almost unknown, not appearing on the title-page of 
any of the numerous editions through which the 
work has passed, nor even being included in the 
recent "Dictionary of National Biography." In 
the Introduction to the new and beautiful edition 
just issued (imported by Scribner), the Rev. W. H. 
Hutton, B.D., supplies the very meagre information 
that the book came from the pen of Miss Manning, 
and that " almost all that her wishes suffer us to 
know is that she was sister of Mr. William Oke 
Manning, to whom she affectionately dedicated the 
fourth edition of her work; that she was never 
married ; and that she was a genuine student and 
an indefatigible writer on historical and literary 
subjects." The style of this book professing to be 
the journal of Margaret, the eldest and best be- 
loved of Sir Thomas More's daughters is in the 
quaint old English spelling and the prose forms of 
composition of the sixteenth century; and every 
detail of the present handsome edition is in keeping 
with these characteristics. The illustrators Mr. 
John Jellicoe and Mr. Herbert Railton have im- 
bibed the spirit of the text ; and the reader, aided 
by their twenty-five illustrations, feels that he does 
indeed see the home of him who was called " the 
best of all the English," with his family, in their 
habits as they lived. 

The volume of " Ballads and Other 
Poems" that completes the new 
" Thistle " edition of the works of 
Robert Louis Stevenson (Scribner) brings with it a 
welcome surprise in the shape of nearly fifty hith- 
erto unpublished pieces of verse. Written for the 
most part during the past five or six years, and re- 
flecting the new and strange environment in which

THE DIAL,

Stevenson found, or nearly found, the peace of soul 
he so long had sought, these poems reveal to us his 
ripest thought upon the vast themes of human life 
and destiny. Their brave undaunted temper is noth- 
ing new to us, nor their frank acceptance of what- 
ever life might have in store. Reading these last 
poems, it becomes more difficult than ever to real- 
ize that the bright spirit that found expression in 
them has left us forever. Here is a noble and 
pathetic quatrain that would have been worthy of 
Lander : 

" I have trod the upward and the downward slope ; 

I have endured and done in days before ; 
I have longed for all, and bid farewell to hope ; 

And I have lived and loved, and closed the door." 

A strain more characteristic of the author is found 
in the following song : 

" Bright is the ring of words 

When the right man rings them, 
Fair the fall of songs 

When the singer sings them. 
Still they are carolled and said 

On wings they are carried 
After the singer is dead 

And the maker buried. 
" Low as the singer lies 

In the field of heather, 
Songs of his fashion bring 

The swains together. 
And when the west is red 

With the sunset embers, 
The lover lingers and sings, 

And the maid remembers." 

One more brief illustration may be given a copy 
of verses written on the leper island of Molokai : 
" To see the infinite pity of this place, 
The mangled limb, the devastated face, 
The innocent sufferer smiling at the rod 
A fool were tempted to deny his God. 
He sees, he shrinks. But if he gaze again, 
Lo, beauty springing from the breast of pain ! 
He marks the sisters on the mournful shores ; 
And even a fool is silent and adores." 



That most interesting and important 

A new Life of the ,, r\ TT 

German Emperor, personage, the German Emperor, is 
the subject of the last number of the 
series of " Public Men of To-day" (F. Warne & Co.). 
The author, Mr. Charles Lowe, has already written 
biographies of Bismarck and Alexander III., and has 
shown in them excellent judgment and great famil- 
iarity with European politics. In the present vol- 
ume we see these qualities to even better advantage, 
for the critical balance is held more evenly ; the 
book shows full appreciation of the Emperor's good 
qualities without the warping effect of the enthu- 
siastic admiration that marred the life of Bismarck. 
The author shows his journalistic training by the 
vividness with which he presents the many sides 
of William's character, but his style suffers from 
the constant effort to be vivid, as well as from too 
great a familiarity with German idiom and mode 
of expression. His figures are sometimes almost 
grotesque, and his choice of words extends from 
current slang to the recondite treasures of the un- 
abridged dictionary. But these are minor blem- 



ishes on an excellent presentation of the early life, 
training, and first seven years' rule of an extraordi- 
nary man. As the author says, the life of a mon- 
arch so near the beginning of his reign must nec- 
essarily be a torso. For this reason he has chosen 
the descriptive rather than the critical method, and 
has presented the Emperor's ideas and motives in 
the words of his own speeches. The picture shows 
William's self-confidence, amounting to an assump- 
tion of infallibility on all subjects ; his extreme self- 
consciousness, his pride, restlessness, despotic ten- 
dencies, his almost insane fondness for his army and 
navy, his incessant speech-making and journeyings 
by land and sea. But it shows also his extraordi- 
nary energy, his versatility, his unceasing effort to 
keep the peace of Europe ; it leaves on us the im- 
pression that beneath the froth of youthful vanity 
there are many solid qualities, though it may not 
persuade us to share the author's conviction that 
William is " gifted with such a striking combina- 
tion of both mind and will as has distinguished no 
occupant of the Prussian throne since it was va- 
cated by Frederick the Great." 

The subjects of Mr. George H. Ell- 
Danger's six brief sketches, entitled 
collectively " Idyllists of the Country 
Side " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), are Izaak Walton and 
White of Selborne, Thomas Hardy and Richard 
Jeff cries, our own Thoreau and Burroughs. Mr. 
Ellwanger, like many other writers, is most enjoy- 
able when his language is simplest ; for he has a 
large vocabulary of odd and unusual words, and in 
reading a book of this sort one does not care to 
keep an etymological dictionary at hand. This love 
of words for their own sake has led to the fault 
of spreading his language, of needless repetition. 
Moreover, he does not always make himself quite 
clear, and his grammar is not immaculate. Not- 
withstanding these blemishes, however, the book is 
an entertaining one ; and although, as the author 
asserts, " an unbounded love for nature and a poet's 
eye . . . are alone the gifts of the gods," yet we 
believe that the first, at least, which often lies dor- 
mant in those who are city born and bred, may be 
developed by much reading of the true nature- 
writers. If Mr. Ellwanger shall have succeeded in 
drawing attention to some of these, his book has 
not been written in vain. 



Some literary 
portrait.** by 

D. G. Mitchell. 



The third volume of Mr. Donald G. 
Mitchell's " English Lands, Letters, 

an( j King8 ( Scribner ) is not less 

readable than its two predecessors. Covering the 
period of Queen Anne and the two Georges, it 
includes, of course, some of the most interesting 
figures in England's literary history : the novelists, 
Richardson, Fielding, Miss Burney, Jane Austen, 
Maria Edgeworth ; the famous group of " The Lit- 
erary Club," consisting of Dr. Johnson and his 
worshippers ; the poets Crabbe, Cowper, and Burns, 
and the illustrious company known as " The Lake 



1896.]

Poets," with Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Lamb as 
its central figures. One is again struck with Mr. 
Mitchell's happy art of characterization, in noting 
how he succeeds in giving in a few lines a more 
vivid impression than the whole of some big biog- 
raphy furnishes. Take, for example, Miss Edge- 
worth : the entire two volumes of her recently pub- 
lished " Life and Letters v contain no such clever 
analysis of her life and work as the five pages de- 
voted to her in this little book. 



In Miss Florence A. Maccunn's brief 
"Life of John Knox'' (Houghton) 
we have an admirable sketch of the 
work of the great Scottish reformer, of the Refor- 
mation in Scotland, and of the miserable failure of 
the brilliant Mary Stuart as both queen and woman. 
The narrative moves straight on, with little of 
praise or denunciation, yet is so presented as to 
make the leading characters live before us, with 
their good and bad traits, their mistakes and their 
successes, and with their motives so far as their 
words or their acts have disclosed them. The 
grand and heroic qualities of Knox are apprecia- 
tively set forth, but the other side is not hidden, 
the side that shows his arrogance, pride, ambi- 
tion, harsh cruelty, and personal hatreds. But with 
all his faults, we are shown his wonderful influence 
for good upon the character of the people of Scot- 
land, perhaps a greater shaping influence than any 
other man has ever exercised over a whole nation. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The historical text-books of Professor Philip Van 
Ness Myers have been favorably known to American 
teachers for many years. They certainly have no supe- 
riors for high school and college use, and it is doubtful 
if they are equalled by any of their competitors. Pro- 
fessor Myers has now issued a " History of Greece " 
(Ginn), upon the general lines of his earlier treatment 
of the subject, but expanded to more than double the 
length. The work is compact, up to date, and abun- 
dantly illustrated with well-chosen maps, diagrams, and 
cuts. " A Short History of Greece " (Macmillan), by 
Mr. W. S. Robinson, is a work of perhaps half the com- 
pass of the preceding, sparingly illustrated, but trust- 
worthy and straightforward as to text. 

A number of the lesser known writings of Defoe are 
collected in volumes fifteen and sixteen of the charming 
Dent-Macmillan edition of that author, and complete 
the publication. Our gratitude for this entirely satis- 
factory set of books should be shared about equally by 
the publishers, the learned editor, Mr. George Aitken, 
and the skilful illustrator, Mr. J. B. Yeats. The books 
form as pretty a series as has been seen for many a day. 

The publication of Parts 23, 24, and 25 of The Book 
of the Fair" (Bancroft Company) brings to its close 
that valuable and handsome work. These instalments 
discuss the special buildings of the foreign governments, 
with their contents, and the work of the World's Con- 
gress Auxiliary. A chapter follows on " Results, Awards, 
and Incidents," and then comes a final chapter on the 



California Midwinter International Exposition, which 
was in some respects an offshoot of the Chicago Fair. 
An index completes the work, bringing it up to an even 
thousand pages. We congratulate Mr. Bancroft and 
his associates upon their work. The publication is not 
without some minor defects, but is, on the whole, ex- 
tremely creditable, and very fully accomplishes its pur- 
pose. 

Professor C. F. Bastable's work on Public Finance " 
is so well known to students of the subject that little 
need be said of the new edition recently published (Mac- 
millan) beyond remarking that the author's revision has 
brought the work fully up to date, adding many new 
facts and figures, new chapters on "The Maxims of 
Taxation" and "Death Duties," and a new subject- 
index. Even so recent a matter as the abortive income- 
tax law enacted by our last Congress is brought into 
the discussion, and offers only one among many illustra- 
tions of the timeliness of the new publication. 

The " Arden " Shakespeare, published by Messrs. D. 
C. Heath & Co., is a new series of texts for school use. 
It is aimed in this edition " to present the greater plays 
of the dramatist in their literary aspect, and not merely 
as material for the study of philology or grammar." 
This is the best of theories upon which to prepare a set 
of the plays, and the names of the editors inspire con- 
fidence. The volumes thus far published include " Ham- 
let " and " Macbeth," both edited by Mr. E. K. Cham- 
bers; " Richard II.," edited by Mr. C. H. Herford; 
"Twelfth Night," edited by Mr. Arthur D. Innis; 
" Julius Caesar," edited by Mr. Arthur D. Innes (can 
this be the same gentleman ?), and " As You Like It," 
edited by Mr. J. C. Smith. We may note at the same 
time the admirable edition of " A Midsummer-Night's 
Dream," edited by Miss Katharine Lee Bates, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn. 

Dr. Charles Waldstein's inaugural lecture as Slade 
Professor of Fine Art in Cambridge University is pub- 
lished in a neat volume of 130 odd pages, by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. Dr. Waldstein, treating his theme 
from the three standpoints of the production, the en- 
joyment, and the understanding of art, sketches what 
may be considered an ideal scheme of organization for 
university art study. The book is a most useful and 
suggestive one; and its point of view is timely. 

" Washington a Model in his Library and Life " 
(Young & Co.) is the outcome of a lecture by Dr. 
Eliphalet Nott Potter, now extended and arranged in 
four parts. Dr. Potter has not the gift of clear and sys- 
tematic presentation, but he has gathered together some 
good material concerning Washington's books and his 
way of regarding them and using them. Several times 
the author touches on an attractive topic the present 
whereabouts of Washington's books; and it is to be hoped 
that he will be able to carry out his plan for treating 
this subject fully and in detail. 

We have frequently had occasion to commend the 
" University " series of manuals, designed for the uses 
of the general reader and university extension student, 
and their excellence has often suggested the painful 
contrast that exists between these books and most of 
the books written for a similar purpose by an Ameri- 
can scholar. Their aim " is to educate rather than to 
inform " this is the keynote of their success, and the 
index of the contrast that we have suggested. Mr. J. 
W. Mackail's " Latin Literature " (Scribner), just added 
to the series, is one of the best of them all a really

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



intelligent and delicately critical account of the whole 
subject within moderate compass. It is the work of a 
pupil of the late William Sellar, reflects much of the 
inspiration of his method, and may be unreservedly com- 
mended. 

A trip to the Mediterranean offers an American the 
happiest means of escaping from the severity of a North- 
ern winter, and the number of persons taking such a trip 
grows yearly. Under the title of " The Mediterranean 
Trip" (Scribner), Mr. Noah Brooks has prepared a 
brief guide-book for the use of travellers, including the 
Azores and Madeira in the itinerary. The book is useful 
as far as it goes, but it has the fault of most American 
guide-books in failing to give the exact and detailed 
information that one is so sure to find in his Baedeker. 
Again, illustrations in such a book are an impertinence 
where maps are lacking, and with maps this book is 
most pitifully supplied. To give the traveller a photo- 
graph of Athens when he wants a diagram of the streets 
is like giving stones for bread a fact that cannot be too 
strongly impressed upon the consciousness of most 
guide-book makers. 

It is safe to say that no prettier book for children has 
been published this season than " The Arabella and 
Araminta Stories," just issued by Messrs. Copeland & 
Day. The stories are by Miss Gertrude Smith, and 
they are embellished by fifteen illustrative designs, the 
work of Miss Ethel Reed. A charming introductory 
poem by Miss Mary E. Wilkins gives the book the hap- 
piest kind of a send-off. The title-page describes the 
book as belonging to the " Yellow Hair Library," which 
indicates, we trust, that it is the forerunner of others of 
like design. 

" Brown Heath and Blue Bells " (Macmillan), a 
dainty booklet of Scottish travel-sketches from the pen 
of Mr. William Winter, forms a welcome addition to 
that graceful writer's familiar series " Shakespeare's 
England," " Gray Days and Gold," and " Old Shrines 
and Ivy." The new volume contains, in addition to the 
twelve Scottish sketches, a half-dozen fugitive papers 
on various themes, besides several personal tributes (to 
Doctor Holmes, George Arnold, Fitz-James O'Brien, 
Jefferson, etc.), added, the author says, " with the feel- 
ing that admiration for fine spirits may fitly consort 
with remembrance of beautiful scenes." The merits of 
Mr. Winter's delicate and lucid prose are familiar to 
our readers; and we need only say of the present vol- 
ume that it fulfils the fair promise of its predecessors. 

A book of French Folly in Maxims " (Brentano) is 
a collection of seven hundred sayings, more or less epi- 
grammatic, gathered from the literature which is most 
happy in such utterances, and translated and edited by 
Henri Pene du Bois. The names of Jules Janin, Co- 
quelin, Paul Bourget, Alexandre Dumas fils, Francisque 
Sarcey, Jules Lemaitre, Joubert, Chateaubriand, Pierre 
Loti, Sainte-Beuve, Ferdinand Brunetiere, Victor Hugo 
are an evidence that there is something beside " Folly " 
in these pages; neither is the sub-title "Of the Stage" 
strictly descriptive. 

The Rev. S. Humphreys Gurteen's volume on The 
Arthurian Epic " (Putnam) is a somewhat unscholarly 
attempt to trace the development of the Arthurian 
stories from their inception to the " Idylls of the King." 
The writer is quite unfamiliar with modern investiga- 
tions on his subject, and the historical part of his book 
is therefore not to be treated seriously. The extended 
comparison between Tennyson and that poet's predeces- 



sors in Arthurian fields resolves itself into this: when 
Tennyson follows Walter Map's lead, he is right;. when 
he strikes out for himself, he is inartistic. The criti- 
cism of " Merlin and Vivien " is a fair sample of Mr. 
Gurteen's critical range. The poem is roundly scored 
on Christian grounds because Tennyson did not make 
Vivien the "female Galahad" that Walter Map in- 
tended her to be. Then follows several pages of proof 
that " Vivien of the Idylls no longer retains this char- 
acter " ! Further comment is unnecessary. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have reissued Mr. Con- 
way's edition of Paine's " Rights of Man " in a separate 
volume. 

" Yeast " and The Water Babies " are the latest addi- 
tions to the Macmillan " Pocket Edition " of Charles 
Kingsley's novels. 

The memoirs of Mr. Locker-Lampson, edited by his 
son-in-law, Mr. Augustine Birrell, will shortly appear 
under the title of " My Confidences." 

Volume X. of the Gibbings-Lippincott edition of 
Smollett's novels, containing " The Adventures of Sir 
Launcelot Greaves," has just been published. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. send us a new edition of 
Mr. Arthur Waugh's " Alfred, Lord Tennyson," the 
most satisfactory life of the poet yet published. 

" Ursole Mirouet," translated by Mrs. Hamilton Bell, 
has just been added to the Dent-Macmillan edition of 
Balzac. " Old Goriot " will be the next volume. 

The United States Book Co. reprints in two paper- 
covered volumes its well-known editions of " The Prose 
Dramas of Henrik Ibsen," including eight of the mod- 
ern plays, translated by various hands. 

The long-promised Life of Agassiz, by his pupil and 
associate Jules Marcou, is about ready for publication 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. They will also issue im- 
mediately " England's Darling, and Other Poems," by 
the new laureate. 

Lord Beaconsfield's " Sybil," and Captain Marryatt's 
" Peter Simple " are the latest works to be reprinted in 
the Macmillan edition of standard English fiction. Mr. 
H. D. Traill and Mr. David Hannay write introductions 
for the respective volumes. 

A chapter on " The Mercantile System," translated 
from Professor Schmoller's " Wirthschaftliche Politik 
Friedrichs des Grossen," is the latest addition to Pro- 
fessor Ashley's series of " Economic Classics," published 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

That clever politico-military brochure, " The Battle 
of Dorking," is reprinted in pamphlet form by Messrs. 
Way & Williams. Older readers will recall its remark- 
able vogue in England and America on its first appear- 
ance twenty-five years ago, and the drift of current 
events seems to make its reappearance hardly less timely 
and pertinent. 

The Rev. J. L. Spalding, Bishop of Peoria, has pub- 
lished through Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. a volume 
of " Songs Chiefly from the German." The work of 
translation is gracefully done, reproducing much of the 
feeling and beauty of the originals. An index of 
authors is lacking to the volume, for which defect we 
find it difficult to account. 

A second volume of the selection of " Lyrical Poetry 



1896.]

85 



from the Bible," made by Mr. Ernest Rhys, has just 
appeared with the Dent-Macmillan imprint. Eccles- 
iastes, the Song of Songs, the Prophetic Books, and the 
Gospel of St. Luke are drawn upon for the contents of 
this volume, which thus supplements the earlier selec- 
tion from the Psalter and Job. 

A new edition of Professor A. E. Dolbear's " Matter, 
Ether, and Motion " (Lee & Shepard) contains three 
chapters hitherto unpublished, and embodies several 
corrections of the former text. The note of mysticism, 
apparent in the earlier edition, is still more pronounced 
in this revision, and puts the book, in part, into the 
category of metaphysical publications. 

The progress of specialization in physical science has 
a striking illustration in the newest periodical publica- 
tion of the University of Chicago. It is a quarterly 
devoted to " Terrestrial Magnetism," and the subject 
gives it a title. It is published under the auspices of 
the Ryerson Physical Laboratory, with much learned 
American and European collaboration. 

The " Journal of Pedagogy," published quarterly at 
Binghamton, New York, is in appearance an unpreten- 
tious periodical, but it takes high rank among our edu- 
cational reviews. Its contents are varied and dignified, 
while its editorial comment is serious in tone, advocat- 
ing, as it does, progressive and praiseworthy ideals. No 
teacher who adds this excellent paper to his list will 
regret having done so. 

" The National Review " has never been as well known 
in this country as the other three great English month- 
lies, partly because no effort has been made to distribute 
it, and partly because it has not had quite the power of 
its older contemporaries to secure the services of the 
greatest writers. But for all that, it is an excellent and 
readable periodical, and we note with pleasure that it is 
now supplied to American subscribers by the publisher, 
Mr. Edward Arnold, who has recently established a 
branch office on this side of the Atlantic. 

" The Auk," which is the official organ of the Amer- 
ican Ornithologists' Union, enters upon the thirteenth 
volume of its new series with the January number. It 
is one of the most creditable scientific periodicals that 
we have, and is of interest to more than ornithologists, 
unless we may give that name to all interested in birds. 
Publication is quarterly, and each issue contains a 
highly-attractive colored plate. Mr. L. S. Foster, 35 
Pine street, New York, is the publisher, as well as the 
agent of the Union for all its other publications. 

The July-September number of the " American Jour- 
nal of Archaeology," just published, contains three pa- 
pers of the American School of Classical Studies at 
Athens, an account of " Some Sculptures from Koptos 
in Philadelphia," an article, by the Rev. John P. Peters, 
on " Excavations at Nippur," and a rich miscellany of 
" Archaeological News." Two of the American School 
papers are by Mr. Edward Capps, of the University of 
Chicago, and treat, respectively, of the chorus in the 
later Greek drama, and of recent excavations at Eretria. 
The " Journal " is published quarterly by the Prince- 
ton University Press. 

On the 25th of January, news was received in this 
country of the death of Alexander Macmillan, the 
younger of the two brothers who founded the great 
publishing house that bears their name. He was seventy 
years of age at the time of his death, and had retired 
ten years previously from active participation in the 
business. He made two visits to this country, the sec- 



ond, in 1869, leading to the establishment of the Amer- 
ican branch of the house. The business is now left in the 
hands of his two sons, Frederick and Maurice, of George, 
his nephew, of Mr. George L. Craik, and of Mr. George 
P. Brett, the latter of these gentlemen representing the 
firm in the United States. An American observer can- 
not help marking the close coincidence of this death with 
that of the senior member of the house of Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 

Mr. Morley Roberts, whom some of our readers may 
possibly know as the writer of a few fairly clever short 
stories, has voiced in " The Saturday Review " his indig- 
nant protest against what he calls the " whining appeal 
to the authors of the United States " framed by Mr. 
Hall Caine on behalf of the London Society of Authors. 
He is kind enough to put aside the point, " which could 
be strongly urged, that there are no authors to appeal 
to on the other side of the Western Ocean," but cannot 
rest under the imputation of having been in any way 
concerned in such a demonstration of friendliness and 
good-will. " Those who sign this precious paper go on 
to say that we are proud of the United States. Sir, we 
might be proud of them ; but to say that we are proud 
of them is to speak most disingenuously. Who can be 
proud of our connection with a politically corrupt and 
financially rotten country, with no more than a poor 
minority vainly striving for health ? ... If our liter- 
ature is the only bond between us and this most ill- 
mannered country, it may be time for us to repudiate 
American copyright before the Americans repudiate it. 
But literature is no real bond, because not one Ameri- 
can in a thousand, no, not one in ten thousand, has had 
his manners made less brutal by the most casual ac- 
quaintance with it." Bravo, Mr. Roberts! If we have 
not heard of you before, we have heard of you now, and 
are not likely to forget the lesson in international amen- 
ity conveyed by the courteous phrases of your disclaimer. 

The first number of " Cosmopolis " has reached us, 
and amply fulfils our expectations. It is a monthly 
review in the three culture-languages, English, French, 
and German, published by Mr. Fisher Unwin. Each 
number is to contain 320 pages, so that the purchaser 
really gets a good-sized English magazine, a good-sized 
French one, and a good-sized German one, all within 
the same covers. Among the contents of this January 
issue are the beginnings of serials by Robert Louis 
Stevenson and Mr. Henry James; an acute critical study 
of "Othello," by Dr. Brandes; a piece of pure litera- 
ture in the shape of " Le Chanteur de KymeY' by M. 
Anatole France; an essay on the Roman death-penalty, 
by Professor Mommsen, and papers by Herr Spielhagen, 
Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Edmund Gosse, M. Edouard Rod, 
M. Francisque Sarcey, and several others. Besides these 
leading articles, there are series of " chronicles " which 
constitute perhaps the most noticeable feature of the 
publication. The political chronicles will appear 
monthly, one for each country; the three dramatic chron- 
icles are to be written tri-monthly; while the literary 
chronicles will be bi-monthly for England and Germany, 
monthly for France. Mr. Andrew Lang and M. Jules 
Lemaitre are the literary chroniclers for France and 
England. We understand that occasional chronicles 
from other countries will appear, thus giving the sub- 
scribers to this periodical a fair conspectus of what is 
.going on throughout the world of politics, literature, 
and art. We have long wished that someone would 
undertake such a publication as " Cosmopolis," and we 
heartily welcome the enterprise.

DR. WILLIAM WRIGHTS NEW BOOK. 

AN ACCOUNT OF PALMYRA AND ZENOBIA. 

With Travels and Adventures in Basham and the Desert. By Dr. WILLIAM WRIGHT, author of " The Empire 
of the Hittites," " The Brontes in Ireland," etc. 8vo, cloth, with 32 full-page engravings and 80 other illus- 
trations. $2.50. 

" Palmyra is chiefly known for its ruins and its traditions of Zenobia's illustrious reign. To both of these Dr. Wright does more justice than 
is commonly expected from travellers' tales. He has occupied himself with original research and the study of inscriptions so that his narrative 
has a very different style from that of the vapid second-hand and tenth-rate literature of the majority of unprofessional travellers. Much enter- 
tainment as well as much information may be found in this modest volume." New York Times (September 15, 1895). 



" A vivid picture of the Palmyra of the present day. ... As the book was written for the most part among the scenes which it describes, its 
narratives have a vividness and local coloring that are not found among many works of travel. . . . His book is well illustrated and the narrative 
full of movement and life." Brooklyn Eagle (September 16, 1895). 

" Dr. Wright is master of a style peculiarly fitted for his purpose. He can tell an adventure as well as Mayne Reid ; paint a historical picture 
as graphically as Froude ; and in the passing announce without ostentation the most striking additions of knowledge, take an occasional tilt at 
some formidable scholar just to keep things lively. He has never been quite so successful as in his last book. Those who know most about Palmyra 
and Zenobia acknowledge that this is the standard work on the theme one which can never be ignored when the subject is discussed. Dr. Wright 
has neglected no source of information, and his own investigations have enlarged considerably the area of our knowledge." British Weekly.

MURRAY BUTLER, A.M., Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy, 
Ethics, and Psychology in Columbia College in the City of

emphasizes the considerations which make for progress and for 
hopefulness.

A UNIVERSITY SYMPOSIUM. 

The rapid growth of some of our larger uni- 
versities has given much prominence, during 
the past few years, to the question whether 
they should retain their present form of organ- 
ization, simply expanding upon the old lines, 
or seek to reconstruct themselves upon a basis 
better fitted to meet the needs of their enlarged 
bodies of undergraduate students. In other 
words, it has become a serious question to de- 
cide whether the system which has worked so 
admirably in dealing with hundreds should not 
give place to some system planned with express 
reference to the wants of thousands. In trying 
to answer such a question, we naturally look to 
the Old World, where universities with thou- 
sands of students are not uncommon, and ask 
if some modification made with the best Euro- 
pean models in view may not be worth under- 
taking in the case of our own larger institutions. 
In this survey of the problem as it exists else- 
where than in the United States, attention is, 
of course, chiefly attracted to Germany and to 
England to the former country, because so 
many of our educators have got their training 
and inspiration there ; to the latter because it 
is a priori probable that the main trunk of the 
English race has developed the university ideals 
most likely to find acceptance in any commu- 
nity the offshoot of that race. The New York 
" Evening Post," in a recent issue, presents a 
very interesting account of the English uni- 
versity system, written with reference to its 
possible adoption, or rather adaptation, in the 
United States. This account is accompanied 
by a collection of views expressed by members 
of the Harvard and Yale faculties, examining 
the subject in its general aspects, as well as 
from a number of special standpoints. While 
these expressions of opinion are far from ap- 
proaching unanimity, they make it evident that 
the existence of a very real and pressing prob- 
lem is felt, and that the English university 
system, or certain features thereof, may turn 
out to offer us the best solution. The feeling 
at Harvard, more noticeably than the feeling 
at Yale, seems to favor the English idea, with- 
out, however, giving any countenance to the 
notion that an acceptance en bloc of the En-

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



glish plan of organization would be either prac- 
ticable or desirable. 

To begin our discussion with a few figures, 
the latest statistics show an enrolment of 3358 
students in the Oxford colleges and halls, of 
2795 students in the Cambridge colleges and 
hostels. Against these figures we may set 3600, 
the total enrolment at Harvard University, and 
2415, the total enrolment at Yale University. 
The problem is, then, quantitatively much the 
same in both countries. At the English uni- 
versities, these six thousand odd students are 
members of something like forty colleges, each 
having its own foundation, its own buildings, 
its own corps of instructors, and its own dis- 
cipline. Trinity at Cambridge has over six 
hundred students ; no other college at either 
university has as many as three hundred, and 
a dozen or more have less than one hundred 
each. We need hardly add the information 
that the colleges have nothing to do with honors 
or degrees, except to prepare candidates for 
these distinctions, as awarded respectively by 
the University Senate at Cambridge, and Con- 
vocation at Oxford. In our two American 
universities, on the other hand, half of the stu- 
dents are enrolled in the special or professional 
schools (which to a certain extent embody the 
English college idea), while the other half be- 
long to Yale College and Harvard College, 
1199 to the former, 1771 to the latter. The 
central difficulty is in these two overgrown col- 
leges, still organized upon a plan admirably 
adapted to the hundreds of a generation ago, 
but not equal to the demands made by the 
greatly increased numbers of the present. 

It will be seen that this educational diffi- 
culty is analogous to the political difficulty with 
which the larger centralized governments of 
to-day are forced to contend. The French Re- 
public, for example, or the English monarchy, 
suffers in a hundred ways from over-centrali- 
zation. A system that was once fairly adequate 
is found sadly wanting in this age of multiplied 
special interests and local self-assertion. The 
elasticity of the federal system, as displayed in 
the United States, Germany, and Switzerland, 
stands in striking contrast to the rigidity of 
the system which heaps all the work of govern- 
ment, in matters both large and small, upon 
the shoulders of a single set of officials. Many 
a philosophical observer in France or England, 
while not blind to the faults of the federal or- 
ganization of the United States, has cast long- 
ing glances in our direction, and recognized 
the fact that our Federal system, in spite of 



the imperfections of its working-out, embodies 
the political ideal toward which the larger gov- 
ernments of the world are inevitably tending. 
This is the real explanation of such experi- 
ments in English politics as county and parish 
councils, and even of the mismanaged Home 
Rule movement. That movement failed, as it 
deserved to fail, because it aimed to institute 
local government in but a single part of the 
United Kingdom, and because it sought to be- 
stow a dangerous degree of political power upon 
the people of Ireland ; but the decentralizing 
principle upon which the movement was based 
is a sound one, and so profound an observer as 
Matthew Arnold gave frequent testimony to its 
validity. Applying our analogy to the educa- 
tional question now under discussion, it will 
readily be seen that the English university rep- 
resents the federal type of organization, while 
the American university illustrates the central- 
ized system, once entirely adequate, but now 
so overgrown as to have become unstable from 
its own weight. And just as it would be theo- 
retically possible for the English government 
to transform itself into an artificial reproduc- 
tion of the system which in the United States 
has been a product of natural growth, so it 
would be theoretically possible for Harvard 
University, let us say, to create a system of 
colleges corresponding, in most of the essential 
respects, to the Oxford colleges which began 
as independent foundations, and afterwards be- 
came merged in the aggregate which is known 
as the University of Oxford. 

This, stated in terms of the broadest general- 
ization, is the question which has now reached, 
both at Harvard and Yale, the stage of discus- 
sion in which an ideal becomes something more 
than a mere counsel of perfection, and is 
brought within the range of the practicable. 
A thoughtful paper by the late Frank Bolles 
may be said to have set the ball of discussion 
rolling, and the expressions of opinion now 
brought together by the " Evening Post " sym- 
posium show us the discussion in its present 
state. The more conservative find many diffi- 
culties in the way of reorganization upon the 
college basis. Their objections relate mainly 
to discipline, the division of endowment funds, 
the duplication of teaching, and the weaken- 
ing of loyalty to the university. These objec- 
tions are all worth considering, but it is evi- 
dent that no one of them offers an obstacle to 
reform in the nature of the case insuperable. 
And it is equally evident that some sort of com- 
promise in all of these matters would be found

necessary. As one of the Harvard instructors 
puts it, there can be no question of adopting the 
English system as a whole, but only a question 
of adapting its best features to our own use. 

In the matter of discipline, our universities 
now occupy a middle ground between the " mo- 
nastic " English methods and the extreme 
freedom allowed to students in Germany. If 
an improvement is to be made here, it should 
probably be in the English rather than the Ger- 
man direction, but need not go to the extent of 
" gating " and compulsory chapel. As far as 
the question of endowments is concerned, it 
should not be impossible or even extremely dif- 
ficult to make an equitable allotment to the 
several colleges, should such be organized. The 
division of teaching should probably not be 
carried nearly as far as at Oxford and Cam- 
bridge, both because the expense of the En- 
glish system is very great, and because the 
range of the student under that system is un- 
necessarily narrowed to the courses he can get 
within the walls of his own college. A wise 
adjustment of this matter of teaching would go 
far to remove whatever force there may be in 
the argument that the English system stimu- 
lates loyalty to the college at the expense of 
loyalty to the university. 

On the whole, the subject seems to be one 
eminently open to discussion, with the balance 
of argument inclining a little toward the col- 
lege idea. The positive pleas made for that 
idea are forcible, to say the least. The pres- 
ent system is said to result in something like 
" social chaos," under which, as Mr. Bolles 
wrote, a man might possibly be " a living, hop- 
ing despairing part of Harvard College," eating, 
sleeping, studying alone, and "not even hav- 
ing the privilege of seeing his administrative 
officers without having to explain to them who 
he is and what he is." This plaint is amplified 
with a good deal of force by the Harvard cor- 
respondent of the " Evening Post," who uses 
the following language : " Plainly, the old- 
fashioned idea of a student's benefiting by 
contact with and the example of his teachers 
and officers outside the lecture-rooms is at pres- 
ent relegated to the past, and the proof of that, 
if any were needed, is to be found in the utter- 
ances of graduates of thirty or forty years ago 
in regard to their teachers, as compared with 
those of graduates of recent years. One hears, 
too, constant complaint that the men are liv- 
ing their lives in smaller groups, coming less 
and less into contact with one another, and so 
leaving Cambridge with a narrower point of 



view than a university-bred man should have, 
while the class organization and fraternal feel- 
ing, long since killed by the elective system of 
studies and the large number of students, is 
soon to be definitely buried by the inevitable 
adoption of a three-years course in some form 
or other." It may be worth while, in closing this 
presentation of an interesting discussion, to call 
attention to the fact that the organization of the 
University of Chicago carries the division of 
faculties and student-bodies a little farther than 
it is carried elsewhere, and that the several 
" halls," which constitute one of the most dis- 
tinctive features of this institution, are, to a 
limited extent at least, like the colleges of an 
English university. That is, they provide a cer- 
tain amount of discipline and self-government, 
of personal relation between students and in- 
structors, and of social intercourse ; and, in so 
far as they provide these things, they approach 
the type that the advocates of the English col- 
lege system have in mind. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE PROBLEM OF THE "YOUNG PERSON" 

IN LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The problem of the freedom of literary expression is, 
as THE DIAL intimates in its last issue, a " vexatious " 
one; but I think it must be more clearly apprehended 
that its vexatiousness lies largely in the fact that it is 
distinctly a two-fold problem: first, as to the scope of 
literary art ; and second, as to its dissemination, or, in 
other terms, the problem of the " Young Person." 

As to the first problem, we must remark that literary 
art, like all art, was in its origin lyric and hortatory; 
the love-song proceeded from and excited to love, the 
war-story was the expression of and incitement to war. 
And, in fact, every representation by early art was 
avowedly to stimulate the action represented, and so if 
the action was evil, the art also was evil. But while lit- 
erary art was primitively excitement and incitement, in 
our day it has attained a high degree of dramatic and 
psychological objectivity, and even depicts innocently and 
artistically the coarsest sexuality. Thus, Zola deals with 
the most licentious subjects without allure, but with com- 
plete artistic objectivity. " La Terre," for instance, is 
a powerfully artistic realization of the typical force and 
significance of the coarsest peasant sexuality, which is 
invested with a certain large aesthetic interest compar- 
able in its kind with that which Millet's paintings throw 
about the peasant as sodden toiler. But Zola should 
make the history of the typical prurient reader of his 
works the subject for a novel. 

Every fact, then, so general as to be of typical sig- 
nificance, objective art can dignify and glorify. Art 
sounds all the depths as well as all the heights of life; 
it treats impartially the lowest animalism and the gross- 
est crime, as well as the loftiest aspiration and the no- 
blest endeavor. The " (Edipus Tyrannus " of Sopho-

[Feb. 16, 



cles, the " Cenci " of Shelley, the " La Terre " of Zola, 
are as truly works of art as the " Paradiso " of Dante, 
the " Imitation " of Thomas d Kempis, or Banyan's 
" Pilgrim's Progress." Purely artistic appreciation of 
any of these carries no influence on the actions and life. 
Objective art is separate from life ; it is a life of its own, 
which stands wholly without the life it feeds on; to it, 
all is spectacle. 

But we come now to the second side of the problem : 
whether the dissemination of all literary art should be 
as universal as its scope. It is an obvious fact, and, 
indeed, a sad one, that art is mostly used for unartistic 
enjoyment, to stir every passion and emotion but the 
aesthetic. Anyone who watches, for instance, the crowds 
at the theatres, must feel this to be true. And so all 
art, literary, graphic, musical, as well as dramatic, is 
continually diverted from its true purpose, and is made 
to minister to reality rather than ideality. That the art 
of a novelist is thus swerved is not that artist's fault; 
that people read " La Terre " and " Jude the Obscure " 
to stimulate their passions rather than their aesthetic 
natures, does not, from one point of view, attach blame 
to the writers. Still, these novelists may well ask 
whether they should not respect the weakness of the 
grand majority to whom their writings may come, or 
whether other and less dangerous subjects may not give 
full development to their creativeness. Goethe knew 
well the universal scope of art, but he did not publish 
his freest productions, keeping them only for a few ap- 
preciative friends. Zola appears to be an honest artist, 
but his novels, spread broadcast, have sown great cor- 
ruption. Readers in general are unable to attain the 
free and calm objective spirit which such art demands ; 
with them, art is the servant of reality; with them, the 
thought of evil becomes an evil thought. While to most 
the thought of murder may not be a murderous thought, 
yet the thought of lust is a lustful thought. It may be 
a reflection on our civilization, but it is still an un- 
doubted fact, that though society has got beyond the 
danger-point as regards such a homicidal novel as Sien- 
kiewicz's " Fire and Sword," it yet feels most evil effects 
from such lustful novels as Zola's " La Terre." While 
we acknowledge that Zolaism, as the art which flinches 
not at any human animalism and sexualism, has a cer- 
tain theoretical vindication, yet we must consider its 
general circulation extremely noxious. It is a bit of 
stubborn Philistinism to decry real art of any kind, but 
it is a matter of common-sense to keep art away from 
those who will only misuse it. HIRAM M. STANLEY.

EMERSON'S IDEAS OF TEACHING LITERATURE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Students of the biographies of great authors must 
have been reminded many times that the curricula of 
colleges and universities were not adapted to the minds 
of expanding genius. Turning aside from the college 
courses, they have often had their souls kindled and 
their imagination aroused by the reading of the best 
literature, or, as was the case with Wordsworth, have 
found in Nature joy and inspiration. This cannot be 
explained by saying that genius must educate itself, 
this is begging the question; genius demands life, and 
this is what universities have not given them in many 
cases. Tennyson found more interest in attending the 
meetings of the Water Club, where he and those gifted 
young men talked " on mind, and art, and labor, and the 
changing mart," than he did in the Cambridge curri- 



culum. What is true of authors has been true of many 
men of less power; this is what those who plead for the 
study of literature in colleges to-day are striving to ob- 
viate they are striving to bring into the lines of col- 
lege men that larger inspiration that comes from a study 
of the works of imagination. 

While many men of genius have felt this lack of 
inspiration, Emerson felt and expressed it in words 
that have in them the very force of the great emanci- 
pator. He experienced the need of it in his own life. 
He has told us of the " idle books under the bench at 
the Latin School," and many of his fellow-students have 
left us accounts of his extensive reading while at Har- 
vard. He knew less about text-books than many, but a 
great deal more about Shakespeare, Bacon, and Milton. 
He was a " dunce in mathematics," but could " console 
himself with Chaucer and Montaigne, with Plutarch 
and Plato, at night." From his earliest days he lived 
in the atmosphere of literature, although he was very 
far from letting any books he might read take away the 
original bent of his own mind. He was a creative 
reader; following his own advice along that line admir- 
ably, he was as far removed as possible from mere re- 
ceptive reading. 

Having graduated at Harvard, Emerson became an 
associate with his brother William in a school for young 
ladies. Many years afterwards, in speaking to some of 
his old pupils, he expressed a deep regret for two things 
that had happened while he was a teacher. " The first 
is that my teaching was partial and external. I was at 
the very time already writing every night, in my cham- 
ber, my first thoughts on morals and the beautiful laws 
of compensation and of individual genius, which to ob- 
serve and illustrate have given sweetness to many years 
of my life. I am afraid no hint of this ever came into 
the school, where we clung to the safe and cold details 
of languages, geography, arithmetic, and chemistry. 
Now I believe that each should serve the other by his 
or her strength, not by their weakness, and that, if I 
could have had an hour of deep thought at that time, I 
could have engaged in thoughts that would have given 
reality and depth and joy to the school, and raised all 
the details to the highest pleasure and nobleness. Then 
I should have shown you (as I did afterwards to later 
friends) the poems and works of imagination I de- 
lighted in; the single passages which have made some 
men immortal. The sharing of a joy of this kind makes 
teaching a liberal and delicious art. What I wonder 
at is that I did not read to you, and attempt to teach 
you to read certain selections of Shakespeare and the 
poets, in which in late years I have had a certain degree 
of success." * 

Dr. Holmes tells us that when Emerson was teach- 
ing at Chelmsford, somewhat later, " one of his modes 
of instruction was to give the boys a piece of reading 
to carry home with them, from some book like Plu- 
tarch's Lives, and the next day to examine them and 
find out how much they retained from their reading." 
It is no wonder that these boys found in him a great 
inspiration. 

In August, 1838, Emerson made the opening address 
at the American Institute of Education in Boston. The 

* This may account for the fact that Emerson was not a 
happy teacher, rather, " a hopeless schoolmaster," as he called 
himself. How many teachers there are to-day worrying their 
lives out teaching grammar and rules of composition, to say 
nothing of other dry-as-dust, when they might be leading the 
young into the enjoyment of the life of literature.

subject was, " The best mode of inspiring a correct 
taste in English literature." I give Mr. Cabot's account 
of the lecture: " The leading thought was that since all 
the colleges in the world cannot make one scholar, any 
more than the physician can make one drop of blood, 
those who are to supervise education must not expect 
much from ingenious methods or urgent appeals, but 
should aim to awaken in those under their charge the 
sense of their own powers and their particular voca- 
tion, and in the way of instruction acquaint them with 
the wealth of their mother-tongue, as the best means 
for calling out their capabilities, whatever these may 
be. The first step towards a revolution in our state of 
society, would be to impress men's minds with the fact 
that the purest pleasures of life are at hand, unknown 
to them; that whilst all manner of miserable books 
swarm like flies, the fathers of counsel and of heroism, 
Shakespeare, Milton, and Taylor, lie neglected. As to 
method, would you inspire in a young man a taste for 
Chaucer and Bacon ? Quote them." This last advice 
sounds rery much like the words of Dr. Corson in " The 
Aims of Literary Study," and can be readily understood 
by all those who have ever heard that great teacher 
read the classic pieces of English literature. 

In 1864 Emerson delivered an address on university 
education. After speaking of defects in the educational 
system at that time, and anticipating the elective sys- 
tem of modern times, he says: "Then the imagination 
must be addressed. Why always coast on the surface, 
and never open the interior of nature not by science, 
which is surface still, but by poetry. Shakespeare should 
be a study in the colleges, as Boccaccio was appointed 
in Florence to lecture on Dante. The students should 
be educated not only in the intelligence of, but in sym- 
pathy with, the thoughts of the great poets. Let us 
have these warblings as well as logarithms." Emerson 
had a faith that everyone is capable of some interest 
in literature. A great number of his lectures were on 
the subject of English Literature. Who can tell how 
much he accomplished, in New England and elsewhere, 
in the way of spiritualizing the lives of people by bring- 
ing them in contact with the best literature, and who 
can calculate what will be the good to come from the 
sympathetic study of literature in the colleges of Amer- 
ica, not the study of philology, nor the study of criti- 
cisms on literature, but the literature itself ?

MODERX NAVAL, WARFARE.* 



Naval men and general readers interested in 
current naval problems will find in Mr. H. W. 
Wilson's new volume, " Ironclads in Action," 
a most useful and informing book. The au- 
thor's aim has been to present, with fair detail 
and with constant reference to the technical 
value and bearing of the facts narrated, a sketch 
of naval warfare during the period of transi- 
tion which has followed the introduction of 
steam that is to say, from 1855, when ar- 
mored ships were first tested in action (at 
Kinburn in the Crimea) and the history of the 
ironclad may be said to have begun. The ques- 
tions which agitate the naval world to-day are, 
despite the practical teachings of the past two 
years, largely open ones, and must remain so 
until brought to the crucial test of a great sea- 
fight, or a series of them, between two first- 
class maritime powers. As Lord Salisbury 
said recently : 

" In respect to armaments, nobody yet knows what 
the torpedo will do in actual warfare. Nobody yet 
knows which is the more important, the big ironclad or 
the swift cruiser. These things can only be decided by 
experience. You can obtain for any particular opinion 
any collection of expert authority you wish to get. . . ." 

While, however, the world's experience of naval 
warfare has been small (perhaps distressingly 
so, from the professional standpoint) since the 
advent of steam and armor, material for induc- 
tion is not wholly lacking ; and this material 
the reader will find intelligently sifted and ar- 
ranged, and attractively set forth, in the work 
before us. In his Introduction, Captain A. T. 
Mahan emphasizes his approval of Mr. Wil- 
son's book by laying down the principle that, 
even in the present period of transition, exper- 
iment, and rapid development, it is to history, 
rather than to theorizing and the tests of the 
proving-ground, that the naval profession should 
chiefly look for guidance. 

" Scanty indications there obtained are worth much 
more than the most carefully arranged programme, in 
which the elements of actual danger, of perplexity re- 
sulting from anxious doubt, of the confusion and chances 
of real battle, cannot be efficaciously represented." 

Nearly two-thirds of Mr. Wilson's opening 
volume are devoted to the naval operations of 
our Civil War, including an instructive chap-

ter on " The Blockade, Blockade- Runners, and 
International Law." The remaining chapters 
in the volume describe severally " The Battle 
of Lissa," " South American Wars (1865- 
70)," " Naval Events of the Franco-German 
War," "Actions off the South American Coast," 
and " The Bombardment of the Alexandrian 
Forts." In Volume II. the author, after a 
brief resume of the French naval operations in 
Tunis and the East, proceeds to give a detailed 
critical account of the maritime phases of the 
recent struggle in the Orient. The opening 
action off Asan and the subsequent sinking of 
the transport Kowshing by the Japanese cruiser 
Naniwa are vividly described, as is the memor- 
able, if not very instructive, fight off the mouth 
of the Yalu. A thoughtful chapter is devoted 
to a prophetic picture of " The Naval Battle of 
To-morrow," and a painful one to " Ironclad 
Catastrophes," in which are recounted the 
tragic episodes of the foundering of the Cap- 
tain, the sinking by collision of the Vanguard, 
the Grosser Kurfiirst, and the Victoria, and 
the loss of the Reina Regente. The work 
closes with an instructive chapter on the devel- 
opment of the British battleship. 

Mr. Wilson's account of the action off Asan 
and of the sinking of the Kowshing (both of 
which events took place before a declaration 
of war had been made) is not favorable to the 
Japanese. It may be remembered that the 
Asan affair arose from a chance meeting in the 
Gulf of Korea of the three Chinese warships, 
the Tsi Yuen, the Kuwan-Shi, and the Tsao- 
Kiang, with the fast Japanese cruisers Yosh- 
ino, Naniwa, and AJdtsusu. According to 
Japanese reports, the Chinese were the aggres- 
sors ; but this time it seems the conflicting Chi- 
nese version is the more probable. According 
to the latter account, the three Japanese ships 
took their opponents unawares, and opened fire 
on them without notice or provocation. At the 
first discharge several shots struck the conning- 
tower of the Tsi Yuen, piercing it, and blow- 
ing to pieces the first lieutenant and a sub- 
lieutenant, while steering-gear, engine-room 
telegraphs, etc., were completely wrecked. Or- 
ders were at once given by the Chinese captain 
to clear for action ; but before anything could 
be done, a second broadside struck the ship, 
working terrible havoc in her upper works, rid- 
dling her hull above water, and placing her 
virtually hors de combat. So searching and 
deadly was the hail of projectiles poured upon 
her by the Japanese quick-firers that not a man 
was left on deck those of the crew who were 



not killed seeking shelter below the armor- 
deck, whence they could not be driven until 
their officers had drawn their revolvers and 
threatened to use them with effect. As soon 
as her hand steering-gear could be got to work, 
the Tsi Yuen, now in dreadful plight, turned 
from her enemies and headed for Wei-hai-wei, 
hotly pursued by the Yoshino, which, for some 
reason not yet clear, finally abandoned the 
chase, allowing her crippled foe to gain shelter 
without further mishap. A European who saw 
the Tsi Yuen on her arrival at Wei-hai-wei 
thus describes her : 

" The vessel presented the appearance of an old wreck. 
The mast was shot through half-way up, the gear was 
torn in pieces, ropes hung loose and tattered. On deck 
the sight was cruel and beggars description. Wood- 
work, cordage, bits of iron, and dead bodies, all lay in 
confusion." 

To this an English officer adds : 

" The slaughter had been awful, blood and human re- 
mains being scattered over the decks and guns. Three 
of the five men working the 4-ton gun in the after-tur- 
ret were blown to pieces by a six-inch shell from one 
of the Yoshino's quick-firing guns, and a fourth was shot 
down while trying to leave the turret. The remaining 
gunner stuck to his post, and managed to load and fire 
three rounds at the Yoshino, and, one shell entering her 
engine-room and another blowing her fore-bridge away, 
she hauled off. The Chinese admiral awarded the 
plucky gunner 1000 taels. One shell struck the Tsi 
Yuen's steel deck, and, glancing, passed up through the 
conning-tower and exploded, blowing the gunnery lieu- 
tenant to pieces, and leaving his head hanging to one of 
the voice-pipes. Huge fragments of armor and back- 
ing had been torn from their fastenings and carried in- 
board, crushing a number of poor wretches into shape- 
less masses, even the upper part of the funnels being 
splashed with blood. An engineer-officer (European) 
was sent for to repair the steam-pipe of the steering- 
engine, and tried to grope his way through the smoke 
of bursting shells and heaps of killed and wounded lying 
on the deck, when a shot struck his assistant and dis- 
embowelled him, covering the engineer with blood. He 
nevertheless managed to reach the steering-engine, and 
repaired the pipe, for which he received a rather hand- 
some reward from the admiral." 

Still more tragic than the fate of the Tsi 
Yuen was that of the Kowshing an English 
steamer of 1355 tons, flying the British flag 
and carrying a British captain and British offi- 
cers, and chartered by the Chinese to convey 
troops to Korea. On July 23 she left Taku, 
having on board 1100 Chinese infantry, two 
Chinese generals, Major You Hanneken, and 
twelve field-guns with a large quantity of am- 
munition. On July 25 (the day of the Asan 
fight) she sighted a large warship, probably the 
Tsi Yuen in retreat before the Japanese, steam- 
ing westward. An hour later four large iron- 
clads, also heading west, hove in sight, and it

was presently seen that the nearest vessel flew 
the Japanese flag. She approached rapidly, 
saluted the Kowshing, and passed her. The 
Japanese vessels appeared to be chasing the 
Tsan CMeng (which had also been sighted), 
and to intend no harm to the Kowshing ; but 
presently the nearest ship signalled the English 
vessel to anchor. The order was obeyed, and 
was followed by a second one, " Remain where 
you are or take the consequences," after which 
the Japanese ship circled and signalled to her 
consorts. As she afterwards drew rapidly nearer 
it was seen that her crew were at quarters, and 
her guns trained on the Kowshing. A boat 
was lowered and sent to the English vessel, 
when it was learned that the challenger was 
the cruiser Naniwa, Captain Togo. The Chi- 
nese on the Kowshing were greatly excited ; 
and, when urged by Von Hanneken and the 
English officers to surrender, replied that they 
would die first, and asserted that if the English 
attempted to leave the ship they should be 
killed. Meantime, the Japanese officers who 
had boarded the Kowshing were told that she 
was a British ship, with the British consul's 
clearance, and that she had sailed in peace and 
in good faith. In reply, the Kowshing was 
ordered to follow the Naniwa ; but this course 
the Chinese, who had set a guard over the an- 
chor, absolutely refused to allow, and Von Han- 
neken, finding argument useless, had the Nan- 
iwa's boat recalled. Placed thus between two 
fires, the foreigners were in no enviable plight. 
The Japanese were clearly determined to take 
or to sink the Kowshing ; and the Chinamen 
were apparently bent on resisting the Naniwa 's 
onset with small-arms. Close upon the return 
of the Naniwa's boat to her ship came the 
warning signal, addressed to the Europeans, 
" Quit ship as soon as possible," this order be- 
ing followed a moment later by the peremptory 
one, " Weigh, cut, or slip ; wait for nothing." 
To obey, in the face of a thousand armed and 
menacing Chinamen, was hopeless ; and the 
Kowshing' s captain signalled back, " We can- 
not." At once the Naniwa got under way, 
blowing a long and ominous blast on her steam 
siren, and hoisting a red flag. Approaching 
to within 500 yards or less of the ill-fated trans- 
port, she discharged a torpedo, firing at the 
same instant with a terrific crash and with mur- 
derous effect a broadside from her five guns, 
two of twenty-eight tons, and three six-inch. 
According to Von Hanneken, the torpedo struck 
a coal bunker amidships. " The day became 
night ; pieces of coal, splinters, and water filled 



the air, and then all of us leaped overboard 
and swam." Other survivors state that the 
torpedo missed, and that the main damage was 
done by a 500-lb. shell which exploded the 
Kowshing's boilers. The transport soon listed 
heavily to starboard, while the deadly Japanese 
fire raked her crowded decks, riddled her sides 
and top-hamper, and searched her vitals. 

" From the Naniwa' s tops, where were mounted Gat- 
lings, and from Nordenfelts and small quick-firers on 
her upper deck, came a hail of small projectiles, tear- 
ing through the dense mass of Chinamen on the Kow- 
shing's deck. The Chinese replied in a futile, though 
gallant manner, by discharging their rifles at the enemy. 
The result could not be long in doubt. The heel of the 
Kowshing became greater, and she sank lower and lower 
in the water, till, about 2 o'clock, an hour from the fir- 
ing of the first shot, her deck was submerged. All this 
time the Europeans, and many of the Chinese who had 
leaped overboard, were in the water, exposed to stray 
shots from the Japanese, and deliberately fired upon by 
the Chinese who were still left on board the sinking 
ship. Bullets began to strike the water on all sides of 
us,' says Mr. Tamplin, the Kowshing's first officer, ' and, 
turning to see whence they came, I saw that the Chi- 
nese, herding round the only part of the Kowshing that 
was then out of water, were firing at us.' " 

The scene that followed the sinking of the 
Kowshing was a terrible one, and, according 
to evidence which the author deems " incontro- 
vertible," a most disgraceful and barbarous one. 
It appears that the Japanese not only made no 
attempt whatever to rescue their drowning ene- 
mies, but deliberately fired upon them in the 
water an act which, to the Western mind, 
no plea short of the direst necessity can palli- 
ate. Mr. Tamplin of the Kowshing, who had 
been picked up by one of the Naniwa's boats, 
testifies that the officer in charge told him that 
he " had orders to sink the Chinese lifeboats, 
and in spite of remonstrances he proceeded to 
do so." Two volleys were fired into them, and 
both were sunk ; and the Naniwa, having com- 
pleted her bloody work, steamed backwards 
and forwards on the scene of her not very cred- 
itable victory until eight in the evening. 

From the Yalu fight, which is described and 
minutely analyzed by the author, the most con- 
tradictory deductions have been drawn each 
naval expert finding in it full confirmation of 
his particular hobby. While it was the first 
time that fleets equipped with modern engines 
of destruction, monster guns, torpedoes, quick- 
firers, went into action, it must be remembered 
that no large first-rate battleships of recent 
types fought at the Yalu. The Japanese vic- 
tory was a foregone conclusion a fact of which 
they themselves were thoroughly aware. Their 
moral superiority alone was enough to decide

the issue ; but in addition to this they had bet- 
ter and newer guns, with speedier and, on the 
average, larger ships. They fought through- 
out by signal, as a compact, organized force ; 
while their opponents were, after the first on- 
set, merely a mob of ships. The gunnery of 
the Chinese was extremely indifferent, their 
heavy guns were antiquated, and they carried 
no large quick-firers thus lacking precisely 
the weapons which would have been most ef- 
fective against the Japanese unarmored cruis- 
ers. The Japanese had, of weapons ranging 
from the 6.8-inch Krupp to the 4.7-inch Arm- 
strong, no less than ninety-four, sixty-six of 
them quick-firers ; while the Chinese had, of 
corresponding calibres, only twenty-seven, prob- 
ably all slow-firers. The numerical disparity 
is virtually increased by the fact that, as a quick- 
firer will discharge in a given time from three 
to six times as many rounds as a slow-firer, 
each Japanese quick-firer was worth three Chi- 
nese guns ; and a rough calculation shows that 
whereas the whole Chinese fleet could fire on 
the broadside, in a space of ten minutes, 58,- 
620 pounds of projectiles, the weight of metal 
discharged in the same period by the Japanese 
was 119,700 pounds, making the artillery pre- 
ponderance of the latter nearly two to one. 
The greater speed of the Japanese vessels gave 
them an advantage comparable to the posses- 
sion of the weather-guage, and enabled them 
to wheel and circle at will around their slower 
antagonists. The number of fires that occurred 
on board the ships of both combatants was a 
striking feature of the battle ; and a propos of 
this we may quote the account of a European 
who served on the large armored ship, Chen 
Yuen (Chinese). 

" In helping to put out one] of those fires I was 
wounded. The fire was forward, on the forecastle, and 
there was such a fierce fire sweeping the deck between 
it and the fore-barbette, that the officer whom I ordered 
to go and put it out declared it to be impossible to get 
there alive; so I had to go myself. I called for volun- 
teers, and got some splendid fellows some of our best 
men, unhappily, for nearly all were killed, but we got 
the fire under. The fire was on the port side, and as 
the starboard fore-barbette gun was firing across it, I 
sent orders that it was only to fire on the starboard 
side, but, as bad luck would have it, the man who re- 
ceived the order, the Number One of the gun, had his 
head shot off just after I had gone forward, and his suc- 
cessor did not know of the order. As I stooped to pick 
up the hose, a shell, or a fragment, passed between my 
wrists, grazing each. Shortly afterwards, I heard a loud 
explosion, and saw a brilliant light behind me, was 
knocked down, and lay unconscious for a while how 
long I do not know. I believe it was the flame from 
the gun which I had ordered to fire only on the star- 
board side, but it may have been a shell exploding, 



though, if so, I ought to have been blown to pieces. 
Anyhow, I was pretty badly burnt, and when I came 
to I sat up leaning on my elbow, and found myself look- 
ing down the tube of the great gun pointing straight 
at me. I saw the end move a little to one side, then to 
the other, up a little, then down: and I waited for years 
a fraction of a second no doubt for the gun to fire, 
for I knew the gunner had taken aim. Then it sud- 
denly occurred to me to make an effort. I rolled over 
on my side, and by great good fortune, down a hatch- 
way some eight feet or so, onto a heap of rubbish, which 
broke my fall; as I fell I heard the roar of the big gun." 

Reviewing his deductions as to the lessons 
to be drawn from the Yalu, Mr. Wilson con- 
cludes that, except as to the danger of fire, the 
engagement has done nothing but emphasize 
known principles, and tends to confirm the 
views of those who hold that " naval science is 
an exact science, and that its issues can be pre- 
dicted." Upon the points where practical in- 
formation is especially needed, such as the use 
and disposal of torpedo-boats in a fleet action, 
or the possibilities of the ram, the Yalu throws 
no light. 

We may fitly conclude our citations with the 
following forecast of " the naval battle of to- 
morrow," admitting at the same time that we 
find some difficulty in entering at all into the 
evident enthusiasm of the writer. 

" Two great lines of monster ships steaming side by 
side, but far apart, whilst the uproar of the cannonade, the 
hail of shells, fills the air. As the minutes pass, funnels 
and superstructures fly in splinters, the draught sinks, 
the speed decreases, ships drop to the rear. The moment 
for close action has come, and the victor steams in on 
the vanquished. The ram and the torpedo, amidst an 
inferno of sinking ships and exploding shells, claim their 
victims. The torpedo-boats of the weaker side in vain 
essay to cover the beaten battleships. Beneath a pall 
of smoke, upon a sea of blood, the mastery of the waters 
is decided for a generation. Such an encounter will 
not lack sensation. To live through it will be a life's 
experience; to fall in it a glorious end." 

Mr. Wilson's book is indispensable to the 
student of naval science, and general readers 
will find its descriptions graphic and its expo- 
sitions lucid. Outwardly the volumes are very 
attractive ; the illustrations are profuse and 
well-chosen, and the maps, charts, etc., all that 
the most exacting could well ask. E. G. J. 



A RECENT decree of the French Education Depart- 
ment has opened some of the French faculties to Amer- 
ican students upon terms so advantageous that the Ger- 
man universities will no longer be likely practically to 
monopolize this constituency. The American bacca- 
laureate degree will hereafter be accepted in France as 
a qualification for admission to these faculties, the old 
restrictions having been largely done away with. MM. 
Berthelot and Bre'al have been particularly active in 
bringing about this change, which has long been urged 
by many American scholars.

RECEXT EDUCATIONAL, LITERATURE.* 



Bishop Spalding's new book on "The Means 
and Ends of Education " has in general the 
same valuable qualities of his earlier works. 
It is marked by clear thinking, deep sympathy, 
reverent faith in God and human nature, high 
ideals of man's worth and work and destiny, and 
so of the teacher's function, and practical ideas 
as to modes of working out these ideals, all 
expressed in a clear and winning style. While 
urging his favorite thoughts with force and 
earnestness, the Bishop is remarkably free from 
those habits of mind, deemed offensive by many, 
which are often associated with the Church- 
man. We have a good illustration of this in 
the catholic chapter entitled " The Scope of 
Public School Education," from which a few 
sentences will be quoted. 

" Unless we bear in mind that the school is but one 
of several educational agencies, we shall not form a 
right estimate of its office. It depends almost wholly 
for its success upon the kind of material furnished it by 
the home, the state, and the church; and, to confine our 
view to our own country, I have little hesitation in 
affirming that our home life, our social and political life, 
and our religious life, have contributed far more to make 
us what we are than any and all of our schools. The 
school, unless it works in harmony with those great 
forces, can do little more than sharpen the wits. Many 
of the teachers of our Indian schools are doubtless com- 
petent and earnest; but the pupils, when they return to 
their tribes, quickly lose what they have gained, because 
they are thrown into an environment which annuls the 
ideals that prevail in the school." 

This protest against an exaggerated estimate 
of the office of the school, and this demand for 
cooperation with the school on the part of the 
home, general society, and the church, are well 
timed. Perhaps we may add that among no 
part of our population are they more needed

than among the Bishop's own co-religionists. 
But to quote again : 

" It is impossible for an enlightened mind not to take 
profound interest in our great system of public educa- 
tion. ... I am willing to assume and to accept as a 
fact that our theological differences make it impossible 
to introduce the teaching of any religious creed into the 
public schools. I take the system as it is, that is, as 
a system of secular education, and I address myself 
more directly to the question proposed: What is, or 
should be, its scope ? . . . I myself am persuaded that 
the real and philosophical basis of morality is belief in 
the power of God. . . . But it is possible, I think, to 
cultivate the moral sense without directly and expressly 
assigning to it this philosophical and religious basis; for 
goodness is largely its own evidence, as virtue is its 
own reward. It all depends on the teacher. . . . We 
must cease to tell boys and girls that education will 
enable them to get hold of the good things of which 
they believe the world to be full; we must make them 
realize rather that the best thing in the world is a noble 
man or woman, and to be that is the only certain way 
to a worthy and contented life." 

" School Interests and Duties " is one of 
those practical books that neither teachers nor 
parents are likely to read too much. The 
sources of the book are shown by its explana- 
tory title : " Developed from Page's * Mutual 
Duties of Parents and Teachers,' from various 
public reports and documents, and from the 
bulletins of the National Board of Education." 
While he is a compiler merely, Mr. King shows 
good judgment and taste in selection and ar- 
rangement. He will not revolutionize the think- 
ing or practice of good teachers, but such 
teachers as read his book will find help and 
encouragement in pursuing the good old ways 
that experience has approved and that can 
never become obsolete. The book has been pre- 
pared with a particular view to reading-circle 
work. 

The leading word in Professor Tompkins's 
titles indicates his point of view. He seeks to 
base the teaching process and the managing 
process on universal ideas. " Science explains 
a group of phenomena by a principle, or law, 
coextensive with the group explained. At least, 
emphasis is given to such a principle. Philos- 
ophy explains a group of phenomena by some 
principle, or law, which extends beyond the 
group explained to all other groups." " The 
Philosophy of Teaching" is devoted to the teach- 
ing process in its wide relations. The great divis- 
ions of the book are : " The Teaching Process," 
" Aim in Teaching," and " Method in Teach- 
ing," the third division receiving principal at- 
tention. This is an outline that is perfectly 
intelligible and coherent. The only question 
that can arise is whether the first and second 



104 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



topics should not be given in the reverse order. 
In the other work, the leading ideas are not 
equally clear. They are : " The Fundamental 
Law," "The Law Creating the Organism," 
and " The Law Executing the Organism." The 
" Law " in question is the " Law of Unity." 
This law is found " within the organism itself," 
or, in the final analysis, " within the spiritual 
unity of the pupil." But how, if the law is in the 
organism, can it evolve the organism and execute 
the organism ? This question, of course, leads 
back to some old contentions about the relations 
of ideas and things. We are quite in sympathy 
with the author's attempt to base school man- 
agement on ideas. We quite agree with him 
in his protest against the wretched empiricism 
of the schools. A person is not equipped for 
school management when he has merely learned 
the catalogue of " do's " and " do not's." " The- 
ory and Practice are organically one, two 
sides of the same process : the process in thought 
and the process in external realization "; " the- 
ory is practice in thought," practice " theory 
emerging from thought," all of which is very 
well put. But the difficulty is organically to 
relate the two. Authors do not always find 
this easy, as the book in hand shows ; and prac- 
tical teachers often find it positively difficult. 
To tell a teacher that he is to manage a school 
with reference to universal ideas, is not to give 
him very much immediate assistance. We have 
never known a teacher in the common schools 
so philosophical, so intelligent, so wise, that he 
did not find much use for the maxim, " Do the 
best you can." And this is the maxim of the 
opportunist, or the empiricist if you will. We 
feel sure that some very intelligent teachers, 
resorting to Professor Tompkins to help them 
in the management of their schools, will, while 
attending to his practical suggestions, have dif- 
ficulty in discovering just where the " philos- 
ophy " comes in. But if the second book is 
the less successful of the two, the author can 
fairly plead that to connect the managing pro- 
cess and universal ideas is much more difficult 
than it is to connect the teaching process and 
such ideas. Once more, we see no reason why 
much pf the matter that is in the second book 
might not with equal propriety, or even more 
propriety, be put in the first one. 

The two new volumes in the " International 
Series " are valuable contributions to the stock 
of kindergarten literature. The " Pedagogics " 
is a translation of fifteen of Froebel's essays, 
collected by Dr. Wichard Lange, and published 
in Berlin in 1861. The translator contributes 



an extended analysis of its contents. While ac- 
knowledging our debt to Dr. Stanley Hall " for 
the wide-spread interest in the United States 
created by his labors in the movement known 
as child study," Dr. Harris certifies : " In this 
book are collected the first great European con- 
tributions to the subject. They are so subtle 
and so suggestive that every teacher should be- 
gin his pedagogical training by reading and 
studying them." The voluminous title of the 
other volume describes its character. In her 
introduction, Miss Blow says that Froebel, in 
the Mother Play, " deciphers all that the child 
feels in cipher, and translates for mothers the 
hieroglyphic of their own instinctive play. As 
a child's book, this little collection of songs 
and games is unique in literature. As a 
mother's book likewise it has no ancestry and 
no posterity. It is the greatest book for little 
children, and the greatest book for mothers, in 
the world. When all women shall have laid to 
heart its lessons, the ideal which hovers before 
us in the immortal pictures of the Madonna 
will be realized, for then, at last, each mother 
will revere and nurture in her child the divine 
humanity." Only an enthusiastic kindergar- 
tener can rise to this high level. 

Mr. Roark has written his " Psychology in 
Education," he says, " for the average teacher, 
and because of the deep interest that the aver- 
age teacher the private in the grand army 
of education is taking in the subject." We 
should say that he has well guaged the reader 
for whom he writes, and that he has written a 
book which is well adapted to his needs. We 
do not remember a book that, everything con- 
sidered, is better worthy of being recommended 
for use in all the places and ways where the 
average teacher may be reached. It is scien- 
tific on the one side and practical on the other. 
It was hardly necessary for the writer to say, 
as he does, " Almost every paragraph was writ- 
ten with the thought constantly in mind, 'What 
application can be made of this in the details 
of every-day school work ? " If we were to 
offer any general criticism, we should say the 
book is over-minute in its division of subject- 
matter. The writer has not invented elements ; 
all the elements that he recognizes exist ; but 
there is reason to think that he has sometimes 
carried his analysis too far for the average 
teacher. We fear that the elaborate division 
which constitutes Chapter II. will produce a 
depressing effect upon the mind of his typical 
reader ; and would suggest to him whether, in his 
next edition, it would not be better to put this

skeleton after his discussion rather than before 
it, or, at least, to insert in this place only the 
main dividing members, leaving the full scheme 
for a later page. Again, we have not found a 
multiplicity of definitions of the same term help- 
ful for the average mind, but rather the contrary 
owing to their leading to confusion. If the 
various groups of definitions are to be retained 
for purposes of critical comparison, they should 
at least be left untouched until the common 
reader has set the main ideas firmly in his mind. 
It is pleasant to see that Mr. Roark knows the 
difference between psychology and physiology. 
He runs some risk of being styled a " faculty " 
psychologist, although he is not so in fact. 
Expecting ourselves to see a reaction from the 
present tendency to throw aside the word " fac- 
ulty " as a psychological term, we are pleased 
to find him saying : 

" Although it is remembered that the mind is a unit, 
and has no divisions, yet the term faculties ' is used, 
because there is no better term by which to express the 
fact that the mind manifests its activity in different 
ways. Dr. Laurie says in his ' Institutes of Education,' 
it seems to me quite unnecessary to abandon the use of 
so useful a word.' Dr. Ladd endorses the term by using 
it, and so does Dr. Van Norden. I am content to be in 
such excellent company, and shall use ' faculties ' as it 
has always been used to name collectively the different 
phases of the mind's activity."

KENAN'S HISTORY or ISRAEL,.* 



The fifth and concluding volume of Kenan's 
" History of the People of Israel " is devoted 
to the period of Jewish Independence and Judea 
under Roman rule. The period covered is one 
of great importance ; during the decades herein 
treated the great religious revolution of the 
Western World was preparing ; Judaism and 
Greece and Rome were in the birth-throes of 
the advent. But beyond the great importance 
attaching to its subject-matter, the volume be- 
fore us has an incidental interest of its own, as 
it is the last, not only of this work, but also of 
the productions of its gifted author's easy pen 
and fertile mind. Renan must have died a 
happy man. With whatever disappointments 
his pilgrimage on earth may have been embit- 
tered, he had the great satisfaction of knowing, 
before death took the pen from his hand, that 
he had succeeded in completing the ambitious 
work of his life. To write the history of nas-

Jewish Independence and Judea under Roman Rule. By

cent Christianity had been the spur of his lit- 
erary and scholarly activity ever since early 
in the sixties. His last work, the history 
of Israel, was in his view the introduction to 
his volumes on Jesus, Paul, the Apostles, the 
Anti-Christ, etc. He was spared to carry out 
his plan to the full ; this fifth part of the his- 
tory of Israel is the final link between the first 
production of his in this critical field, his " Life 
of Jesus," and the last, devoted to the presen- 
tation of the beginnings of Israel. 

The strength and the weakness of Renan's 
method are well known. He writes not as a 
scholar speaking to scholars. He feels that 
he commands a larger audience. He is bril- 
liant in generalizations, epigrammatic in phrase- 
ology. His style is that of a causeur rather 
than of an erudite expositor. His books, for 
this reason, have failed to pass muster before 
the exacting criticism of the German schools, 
of whatever party leanings. It is a mistake to 
suppose that the " higher criticism " welcomed 
in him a sturdy yoke-mate. While Renan ac- 
cepted some of the positions and propositions 
of this school, he was at other times too strongly 
inclined to galvanize old rationalism. He leans 
to rationalistic interpretations of the miracles 
and the miraculous in the biographies of the 
Biblical heroes. This tendency of his is due un- 
doubtedly to his early training under the influ- 
ences of the Catholic Seminary ; but he never 
succeeded in emancipating himself from the 
spell of these earlier ideas, and to the last his 
books show its traces and always where one 
would least expect it. Such surprises, however, 
add spice to his narratives. Renan has been 
called a novelist ; his " Life of Christ " espe- 
cially has been described as belonging to the 
department of fiction. His other works show 
the same ear-marks ; in them the novelist pre- 
dominates over the critic. This verdict is not 
pillared on an opposition to his fundamental 
view on the character and origin of Biblical 
literature. The Dutch and German, and now 
the English, schools of " higher criticism" are 
still bolder than was Renan in denying to the 
Biblical documents an exceptional position 
among the ancient writings on history. And 
yet, the men of these schools have not been less 
insistent in relegating Renan to the ranks of 
brilliant novelists than are the speakers on the 
conservative and orthodox side of the house. 

But this very weakness in the eyes of schol- 
ars constitutes the strength of Renan's method 
in the forum of non-professional readers. He 
writes well and entertainingly. He is never

" dry as dust." Subjects under his touch are 
given bones and muscles and nerves and hearts ; 
and circumstances are endowed with local col- 
oring. What if, occasionally, to turn a pretty 
and striking phrase, he strains a fact too far ? 
The general reader will enjoy the epigram, 
though the German professor will shake his 
head most ominously. 

The volume before us is not to be exempted 
from these strictures. It shows the hand of its 
author. If anything, it lacks brilliancy and 
vim of style. Whether the English version is 
at fault, or the impending shadows of approach- 
ing death had cooled and chilled the impulses 
of the vivacious writer, the impression of a cer- 
tain languor in the movement of the sentences 
and paragraphs becomes confirmed in the 
reader as he proceeds from chapter to chapter. 
Of epigrams there is no dearth, and the old 
habit of misrepresenting facts to bolster a bril- 
liant statement asserts itself time and again. 
The period under discussion gives, it is true, but 
little latitude to a fancy-possessed historian. 
The ground is well explored. Greek and He- 
brew literature of the day is accessible ; the 
material for reconstructing the times as they 
were is abundant. Renan has had in this field 
many predecessors. His book does not advance 
a single new theory or suggest view-points hith- 
erto neglected. And yet the volume is a grate- 
ful addition to the books on the period. For 
it presents to the general reader, in a very at- 
tractive guise, the results of scholarly investiga- 
tions hitherto buried in foreign periodicals and 
inaccessible publications. 

The book is the story of the failure of the 
Maccabean house, and the consequences result- 
ing therefrom. It introduces us into the inner 
life of the Jews, and makes us acquainted with 
their party ambitions and the literature which 
is the precipitate of the religio-political con- 
troversies agitating the Judean world during 
the tottering years of the Maccabean dynastic 
reign. It traces the gradually asserted pre- 
ponderance of Rome in the destiny of Judea 
and Judaism ; it gives us an insight into the 
rise and development of a Judaism denational- 
ized and deterritorialized, its philosophy and 
Messianic outlook, from which Christianity is 
the ripe off-shoot. We are thus in this one 
volume invited to the confidences of the Rab- 
binic schools and the intimacy of the Alexan- 
drian Jewish Platonists. The dual tendency 
of Judaism running toward national exclusive- 
ness, and as strongly toward universal cosmo- 
politanism, is brought out most forcibly a 



dual tendency which explains much in the life 
of Judaism that otherwise seems a riddle. 
Renan has on the whole grasped this dual ele- 
ment most happily, and yet at times he fails to 
remember it. His characterization of the Tal- 
mud and the Talmudic dialectic method is in- 
deed superficial and one-sided, simply because 
he forgets the dualism of Jewish life. Certain 
it is that the Halakha legal rigorism and 
the Haggadah the poetic ethical element of 
Talmudism are not two currents which at no 
time intermingle. The Halakhic Rabbis were 
also the Haggadists. Nor does Renan remember 
that much in the Talmudic discussions is mere 
academic exercise ; the extravagances in method 
and matter are due to school logic, and never 
either had or attempted to have an influence on 
the actualities of religious practice or thought. 
At the period of which this book treats, Tal- 
mudism in this sense was still in its infancy. 
Renan, as many others, unable to pilot their 
craft through the breakers of the Talmudic 
ocean, has not strictly enough kept separate the 
successive stages of the Talmudic process. The 
Talmud seems to him to be almost a personality, 
while it is an encyclopedia of six hundred years, 
in the making of which many generations and 
men had a part. 

Renan's exposition of the differences between 
the politico - religious parties not sects or 
schools the Pharisees, Sadduces, and Essenes, 
is on the whole correct. He has here utilized 
the researches of Jewish scholars. The Phar- 
isees are the party of national independence, 
the party of the learned ; the Sadduces are the 
priestly aristocrats, with little care or under- 
standing for motives beyond those of selfish 
class interest. This general distinction is clearly 
brought out. But Renan fails to connect organ- 
ically with this cardinal difference on the one 
hand the seeming ritualism of the Pharisaic 
" school " which had its origin in the purpose to 
make Jewish family life and the synagogue as 
" holy " as was by law the priestly fraternity 
and the Temple ; or, on the other, the dogmatic 
discussions of immortality, resurrection, and 
providence, which in the national scheme of 
Phariseeism have a bearing totally at variance 
with the ideas ordinarily connoted thereby. 
But even in its imperfect state, Renan's pre- 
sentation will do much to disabuse men of the 
current prejudice that Pharisee and hypocrite 
are exchangeable terms. 

Into other details of this work we cannot en- 
ter. The concluding chapter shows that how- 
ever much Renan may have erred and his schol-

PSYCHOLOGY GONE MAD.* 

The author of " A Scientific Demonstration 
of the Future Life " has made his debut in a 
former work, " The Law of Psychic Phenom- 
ena " (reviewed in THE DIAL of June 16, 
1893) ; and so far as possible he now outdoes 
himself in extreme statements and illogical, or 
rather logic -less, arguments. The so-called 
" scientific demonstration of a future life " is 
based upon alleged thought-transference exper- 
iments, and the general " telepathic " concep- 
tions that are current. As far as there is a sem- 
blance of an argument in the book, it goes about 
as follows : There are two minds, an object- 
ive mind and a subjective mind. The objective 
mind is the one connected with the body and 
exercising the ordinary every -day function 
with which we associate the term rationality. 
On the other hand, the subjective mind dis- 
ports itself quite otherwise ; it is subject to sug- 
gestion, it reasons perfectly and intuitively, has 
a perfect memory, is the seat of the emotions, 
moves ponderable objects without physical con- 
tact, and telepaths freely and vigorously. Fur- 
thermore, as all faculties must be of some use 
here or hereafter, and as the subjective mind 
does not express itself fully and normally here, 
there must be a hereafter ; q. e. d. 

Incidentally to this argument (?) we are re- 
galed by a series of remarkable views. We 
become acquainted with the "subjective mind" 
through " mediums " or " psychics " who are 
suggestible, and thus prove the duality of the 
mind as well as the existence of a soul. Re- 
ligion belongs to the soul, and is therefore 
psychic science. Moses was a psychic ; " he 
subjectively saw the vision of the burning 
bush, and he subjectively ( clairaudiently ) 
heard the voice "; and what he believed to be 
the word of God was " objective Moses talk- 
ing with subjective Moses." The prophets were 
psychics, and "Jesus himself was the most 
stupendous psychic phenomenon the world has 
ever seen." In modern times, mainly through

hypnotism and telepathy, the subjective mind 
has been clearly recognized, and so the highest 
step in the evolution of religion has been 
reached. The possibilities of the subjective 
mind are many and various. " All good music 
is a product of the subjective mind "; bad or 
mechanical music is not. But the subjective 
mind is not to be trifled with : " Psychic phe- 
nomena are never produced except under the 
most intensely abnormal conditions of the phy- 
sical and mental organism "; " all immorality, 
vice, crime, and insanity are the direct results 
of abnormal psychic activity and control over 
the dual mental organization "; " the degree 
of psychic power attainable by anyone is in 
exact proportion to the intensity of his ner- 
vous derangement." Musicians, stenographers, 
typewriters, and compositors all unduly develop 
their subjective powers (and consequently are 
" entitled to shorter hours and increased pay "), 
and are thus liable to nervous and mental dan- 
gers. Anyone who doubts that the author is in 
earnest need only read such a passage as this : 

" Is there any reason to suppose that telepathy is so 
restricted in its field of operations ? Why should it be 
restricted to any two individuals in a group of three or 
more ? As well might one say that the power of grav- 
ity is restricted to two of the heavenly bodies, and that 
because it operates between the sun and the earth, it 
cannot operate between the sun and any other planet. 
As well might one assume that the moon does not shine 
upon the earth, since it is known that the moon derives 
its light from the sun. The logical consequences of 
these two suppositions would be no more disastrous to 
the planetary universe than it is to the mental world to 
suppose that B. cannot telepath to C. because A. can 
telepath to B. In the one case it leads to planetary 
chaos; in the other it leads directly and inevitably into 
the dark and dismal realm of superstition." 

It is difficult to take this effort seriously, but 
everyone who has observed popular reasoning 
upon such topics appreciates the fact that works 
like this have a distinctly pernicious effect. 
They divert interest from profitable channels, 
and bring into disrepute lines of inquiry sim- 
ilar in name but happily different in scope and 
method. Far better the grossest superstition, 
and the most ignorant and crude beliefs, than 
such a senseless parody of the manner and 
methods of science. It is not strange that an 
entire absence of the significance of a fact or 
of the logic of science should occasionally be 
found in combination with the power of putting 
words together in the semblance of an argu- 
ment ; but it is strange that a reputable pub- 
lisher can be found to place his imprint upon 
such a riot of logic- aping extravagances, such 
a protracted mental debauch.

TEACHING THE ART OF WRITING.* 

Between the text-books in rhetoric of even 
ten years ago and the text-books in composition 
of to-day there is a gap which to the teacher of 
English is a safely crossed Rubicon. The past 
decade has seen the practical application of 
what is at bottom not a startling theory : that 
the way to teach a student to write is to make 
him write. The old way of teaching him to write 
by loading him with rhetorical principles has 
lost its hold. Text-books of the present-day 
insist, therefore, that the student shall write ; 
and to be successful now, a text-book must ac- 
cordingly be practical, explicit, and stimulating. 

It is a fact of much significance that some of 
the most distinguished English scholars in the 
country have deemed it worth their while to 
prepare for academies and colleges " Outlines " 
and " Handbooks " and " Foundations " of com- 
position. Among these genuinely successful 
texts is " A Handbook of English Composi- 
tion," by Professor J. M. Hart, of Cornell. 
It is without doubt one of the most interest- 
ing volumes that has been written on the sub- 
ject of writing for many a day. It reads so 
well, in fact, that a teacher might perhaps won- 
der whether it was suitable to use as a class 
drill-book. But, to use stage lingo, it not only 
reads well, it acts well : it stands the test of 
the class-room. Take it through and through, 
it is the best thing of the kind that has ap- 
peared. To justify completely this sweeping 
statement calls for a detailed analysis such as 
would be out of place in THE DIAL. But some 
of the excellent qualities of the book may easily 
be noted. It is written in a style clear, pre- 
cise, and fluent ; its directions are never vague, 
are numerous enough to apply to many cases, 
yet not so numerous as to be confusing ; its 
instances are drawn almost entirely from books 
that every student is likely to have read ; it is 
both sound and original (a sufficiently rare 
combination) in its treatment of the problems 
it sets out to solve. It is, moreover, fully as 
helpful to the teacher as to the student, espe- 
cially to the teacher who has been brought up 
in the inadequacies of the old system and is 
painfully working out his own salvation. Such 
a teacher will find that no conventional dogma 
is overthrown by mere assertion of an opposite 
dogma ; wherever a reason is needed, a reason 
is given. The one possible fault of the book 
is that a student to whom rhetorical issues are

as remote as Venezuela will now and then miss 
the force of a trenchant paragraph. 

The book is in four main parts, the first two 
of which, " Invention " and " Expression," are 
outlined in the table of contents conventionally 
enough. The independent treatment, however, 
begins on the first page, where invention is de- 
fined not as finding out what to say, but as the 
art of putting together what one has to say. 
Under the first head are treated paragraphs 
and the forms of writing (narration, etc.); un- 
der the second, clearness, force, propriety, fig- 
ures. One notes, in passing, the stress laid on 
the necessity of observation ; the careful and 
easily intelligible distinction between will and 
shall ; the proof that our best writers observe 
no distinction in the use of who or which and 
that as coordinate and restrictive relatives ; and 
the much -needed comment on the historical 
present : " The historical present presupposes 
a vivid imagination. Are you sure that you pos- 
sess such an imagination ? Are you really aglow 
over this particular passage ? " The third part 
consists of practical directions in preparing 
compositions for the class-room, together with 
a series of composition subjects suggested by 
means of stimulating questions on familiar 
books. The relation between reading and com- 
position is set forth so plainly here that even 
a careless student must mark the unity that 
runs through his course in English. The last 
part of the book is given up to an interesting 
discussion of the kinds of poetry including 
questions of metre, of oratory and debate 
and to a brief historical sketch of the language. 
The volume is a genuine handbook a book 
for the student to keep close at hand in the 
knowledge that reference to it will always be 
helpful. The general reader, unfortunately, 
has little interest in rhetorical textbooks ; but 
should this one fall into his hands, he will prob- 
ably be led to read a good deal in it before he 
puts it down. MARTIN W. SAMPSON. 



As THE publications of the Browning Society are 
mostly out of print, it has been thought desirable to re- 
produce some of the more valuable critical papers read 
before that organization during the twelve years of its 
existence. Mr. Edward Berdoe has edited a volume of 
such papers, about twenty in number, and prefaced it 
with a brief account of the society and its work. He 
speaks, of course, of Browning as " the greatest En- 
glish poet since Shakespeare," and indulges in other 
critical extravagances, but this does not detract greatly 
from the value of the work, which students of English 
poetry cannot fail to find of use. A second volume is 
promised in case the first proves successful (Macmillan).

MORE BOOKS ON BOTANY.* 



In a recent review, attention was called to the fact 
that in these latter days books dealing with botan- 
ical subjects are appearing with remarkable rapid- 
ity. This statement finds further confirmation in 
the fascicle that has again accumulated for review. 

The completion of Mr. Oliver's translation of 
Kerner's " Natural History of Plants " is a matter 
for congratulation. This important work, in two 
large volumes, appeared almost without notice, and 
American botanists have been agreeably surprised 
to receive an edition of their own. The illustrations 
and typography leave nothing to be desired, and a 
scientific treatise so intelligible to the general reader 
has not appeared in many a day. Although deal- 
ing with a somewhat miscellaneous range of sub- 
jects, and not at all coordinated after the style of a 
text-book, it chiefly emphasizes the newly recog- 
nized and newly named field of " ecology," which, 
freely translated, means plant sociology. The sub- 
jects treated in the first volume have already been 
mentioned in this journal. The second volume, now 
before us, deals with reproduction and the history 
of species. The most brilliant recent advances in 
botany have been in our knowledge of the phenom- 
ena of reproduction, and to have this knowledge 
presented in a popular way is a service to the sci- 
ence as well as to the public. It must be said, how- 
ever, that Kerner's views concerning the reproduc- 
tive processes are faulty in the extreme, and this 
portion of the work should only be read in con- 
nection with Professor Oliver's clear statements 
later in the volume. The story of reproduction 
in plants is now essentially complete in its outlines, 
perfectly uniform in its principles, but wonder- 
fully varied in its expression. In general, in all 
plants there are two kinds of cells specialized for 
reproduction. One kind, the spore, is capable of 
germination alone, and unaided can produce a plant 
body. These spores are not restricted to the lower 
groups, as is so commonly supposed, but are com- 
mon to the highest as well. The " pollen-grains " 
of flowering plants are spores having the same pow- 
ers as the spores of mosses and ferns. The other 
kind of reproductive cell is the gamete, incapable of 
germination alone. Two gametes must coalesce, 
the process being known as the sexual act, and the

resultant cell is then able to produce a plant body. 
Gametes are therefore sexual reproductive cells, 
spores are asexual reproductive cells ; and the fact 
that pollen grains are sexless bodies may be a sur- 
prise to some. Kerner also describes in a most fas- 
cinating way the wonderful devices for securing 
cross-pollination, that almost sensational region in 
the economy of higher plants opened up by Darwin. 
The means of attraction and protection, the marvel- 
lous intricacies of adaptation between flowers and 
insects, the origin and dispersion of species, are all 
chapters of intense interest that deserve more than 
botanical attention. 

One of the notable books that have just appeared 
is Campbell's " Mosses and Ferns." Dr. Campbell 
has long been a student of the " Archegoniatse," so 
named on account of the peculiar female sex organ 
called the "archegonium." These groups of plants 
are the intermediate ones, with the maze of Thal- 
lophytes below them, and the Spermaphytes (" flow- 
ering plants ") above them. This position gives 
them exceptional interest to the student of the evo- 
lution of the plant kingdom. Dr. Campbell pre- 
sents a great body of facts dealing with the embry- 
ology of these forms, and then discusses their genetic 
relationships. The mosses are represented by two 
well-known groups, the liverworts and the true 
mosses. We see now that liverworts have devel- 
oped from the Algae, the so-called " seaweeds " 
among Thallophytes ; that the true mosses have come 
from liverworts, but have led to nothing beyond ; 
that another line of advance from liverworts has 
led to the fern plants ; that the fern plants in turn 
have given rise to the gymnosperms, the group to 
which our conifers belong, but which has led to noth- 
ing further ; while another line from the fern plants 
has developed into our ordinary "flowering plants." 
Such views broaden our conception of the processes 
of evolution, and emphasize the fact that many 
groups of plants represent finished lines so far as 
their present display is concerned, and that the 
" main axis " of evolution is a relatively short one 
after all. 

The Seaweeds have just received treatment at the 
hands of Dr. George Murray, of the British Mus- 
eum. Our ordinary text-books, being compelled to 
give a general account of the plant kingdom, can 
do any special part of it but scant justice. Courses 
in general morphology form the foundation of our 
botanical training, and in these courses seaweeds 
play a very prominent part. This is necessarily so, 
not merely because training begins with them, but 
chiefly because the whole plant kingdom is rooted 
in them, and no proper conception of the higher 
groups can be obtained without their study. No 
general text is full enough to do justice to the sub- 
ject of algae, and Mr. Murray has done valuable 
service in supplying this lack. It is to be regretted 
that he chiefly deals with seaweeds literally ; that is, 
the brown and red forms of our seacoasts. These, 
in a sense, seem to be " finished lines " of algse ; 
while the abounding green algae of the fresh waters

are looked to as the forms from which the higher 
groups have come. 

The most notable event in the domain of syste- 
matic botany is the completion of the great " Kew 
Index." The four large folio volumes of 1300 
closely-printed pages contain a list of the names of 
all flowering plants that have been described up to 
1885, together with their authorities and countries. 
The work is of incalculable benefit to " systemat- 
ists," and is another proof of the sagacity of Charles 
Darwin, who left a bequest to be applied to its pre- 
paration and publication. The amount of biblio- 
graphical work involved is almost beyond computa- 
tion, and could hardly have been possible except 
with the staff and library at command at Kew. 

Physiological Botany is also represented among 
the recent books. This subject has barely been 
introduced into American universities, both from 
lack of properly trained teachers and the time con- 
suming character of the work. What was needed 
was some laboratory guides to show instructors 
how much could be accomplished in very simple 
fashion. That plant physiology, which deals with 
the life phenomena, is of supreme importance, is 
beyond question. The wonder is that we could have 
been content so long with dissecting plant corpses. 
The study of the phenomena of nutrition, growth, 
irritability, reproduction, must be considered funda- 
mental in any biological work. Mr. MacDougal, 
of the University of Minnesota, has supplied us with 
an elementary laboratory guide. Experiments are 
described, one hundred and twelve in number, which 
illustrate the general principles of absorption of 
liquids, movements of water, absorption of gases, 
respiration, and other forms of metabolism, irrita- 
bility, and growth. It is to be hoped that this book 
and others like it will work a revolution in our bot- 
anical teaching, and will help change the point of 
view from the plant as a form and a structure to the 
plant as a thing of life. 

In our swing away from the dead plant, we are 
in danger of losing sight of the fact that physiology 
and ecology are both based upon structure. Plant 
anatomy has been called the " dry bones " of the 
science ; and perhaps it is, but the " bones " are none 
the less necessary. Miss Emily L. Gregory, of Bar- 
nard College, has reminded us that anatomy is still 
to be studied, though the most of us are teaching it 
as an incident to morphology rather than as a sub- 
ject that can stand by itself. Her book is naturally 
divided into anatomy of the cell and anatomy of 
the tissues. The organization of a living cell, espe- 
cially one capable of division, is complex beyond 
any conception of the uninitiated ; and the modifi- 
cation of these cells and their massing into diverse 
tissues will illustrate the possibilities of the com- 
plexity of results that can arise from a unit struc- 
ture. Miss Gregory describes and illustrates the 
prominent facts of plant anatomy, and the book 
will be useful as a reference to those who need direc- 
tion in the demonstration of various kinds of cells 
and tissues. JOHN M. COULTER.

ill 



cle of the Goldfishes " is the longest of the poems, 
and lightly embodies a ripe philosophy of nature 
and man. Probably the verses " On a Bust of Gen- 
eral Grant " will be best remembered and most 
cherished. They limn the character of the " strong, 
simple, silent " captain with the same sympathy and 
unerring judgment that are displayed in the " Com- 
memoration Ode " portraiture of Lincoln. An 
etched photograph of Lowell, jEt. 70, provides the 
volume with an appropriate frontispiece. 

Mr. Henry S. Salt and Mr. Frank B. Sanborn 
have done literature an excellent service in selecting 
from Thoreau's writings a little volume of " Poems 
of Nature." Fifty pieces are thus brought together, 
from " The Dial," " Walden," and other sources. 
Thoreau was not a poet in any finished sense, and 
even his friend Emerson had to admit that " he no 
doubt wanted a lyric faculty and technical skill "; 
but he was a genuine literary force, and the poetic 
aspect of his thought is not without interest. Most 
of his verses were written when he was very young 
from twenty to twenty-five and none of them 
are remarkable ; yet we may say, with one of his 
critics, that there is " a frank and unpretending 
nobleness " about them, and that they have some 
measure of " ripe fulness of thought, gravity of tone, 
and epigrammatic terseness of expression." They 
sometimes faintly suggest Emerson, and sometimes 
Emily Dickinson, and have a nook of their own 
among the works of the Concord School. 

Most readers, we fancy, will be surprised to learn 
that the late Samuel F. Smith, whose " America " 
we all know, was the author of sufficient verse, 
sacred and secular, to fill a volume of three hundred 
and seventy-five pages. Yet such are the dimensions 
of the collection just published, under the editorial 
supervision of General Henry B. Carrington. There 
are in this volume poems for all sorts of domestic 
and public occasions including a number written 
for the famous Harvard class of 1829 all sorts of 
patriotic songs and nature lyrics, all sorts of hymns 
and other sacred pieces. " The morning light is 
breaking" is, of course, as familiar in its way as 
" America," and one cannot help noting the fre- 
quency with which the author prepared new sets of 
words to go with the tunes to which his two best- 
known songs are sung. These pieces are too mod- 
est to challenge technical criticism ; they accomplish 
all that their author expected them to accomplish, 
and we are less sensible, in reading them, of their 
defects as poetry, than of the transparent simplicity, 
kindliness of heart, and genuine religious feeling 
that they embody. Dr. Smith is secure of a place 
in our national affections, and this volume affords 
the best possible memorial of his long, active, and 
helpful career. 

Mr. Henry Stevenson Washburn is, like Dr. 
Smith, the author of one set of verses familiar to 
every American, and his volume is appropriately 
named "The Vacant Chair and Other Poems." 
His work is not unlike that of Dr. Smith, being in 



the main devotional, patriotic, and occasional. There 
is no question of inspiration in such verse as this ; 
it is commonplace in sentiment and pedestrian in 
movement, but it was doubtless pleasant to compose, 
and doubtless gave pleasure to the circle of those 
for whom it was intended. A number of illustra- 
tions add to the attractiveness of Mr. Washburn's 
volume. 

Passing from these collections to Mrs. Stoddard's 
volume, we are in the presence of poetry in a more 
serious sense. It would be difficult to do justice to 
the intensity of noble feeling that throbs beneath 
the stern grave simplicity of these poems. 

" Idle poet, a word with you : 

You sing too much of love's sweet wrong, 
Of rosy cheeks, and purple wine ; 
Give us a loftier song." 

From this reproach, at least, Mrs. Stoddard is free, 
for her song rarely fails to reach into the very heart 
of nature and of life. Let an exquisite lyric of 
" March " witness to one aspect of her thought. 

" Ho, wind of March, speed over sea, 

From mountains where the snows lie deep, 
The cruel glaciers threatening creep, 
And witness this, my jubilee ! 

" Roar from the surf of boreal isles, 

Roar from the hidden, jagged steeps, 
Where the destroyer never sleeps ; 
Ring through the iceberg's Gothic piles ! 

" Voyage through apace with your wild train, 
Harping its shrillest, searching tone, 
Or wailing deep its ancient moan, 
And learn how impotent your reign. 

" Then hover by this garden bed, 

With all your wilful power, behold, 
Just breaking from the leafy mould, 
My little primrose lift its head." 

The impression of Mrs. Stoddard's work, as a whole, 
is a sombre one, but she has the power to compel to 
her mood by sheer force of sincerity; the poetic 
vision is hers in a remarkable degree, and the power 
to impart it. If we may use a figure that seems 
peculiarly appropriate to the occasion, we will say 
that these poems are suggestive of the sea after a 
storm, before the calm has wholly supervened. We 
feel that the waters have been stirred to their depths, 
and that peace has not yet been fully wrought out 
of passion. In all our choir of American singers, 
there is no woman's voice more distinctly individual 
than this, or more compulsive in its appeal. 

In turning from Mrs. Stoddard to Mrs. Fields, 
we pass from turbulence to tranquility of soul. 
" The Singing Shepherd and Other Poems " is a 
sheaf of song preserved from the harvests of some 
thirty years, and winsome with tender hues. A 
quick sensitiveness to all that is beautiful, a strong 
undercurrent of religious feeling, and a fair mas- 
tery of the rhythmical art, are the characteristics of 
the pieces which Mrs. Fields has brought together 
in this her latest volume. As a favorable example, 
we may quote the opening stanzas of " Death, Who 
Art Thou?"

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



" Thus questioned they who watched the .ZEgean Sea 

Stretch up white arms to drag the diver down, 
And they who waked to find Thermopylae 
Scarlet and white with glory overblown. 

" Tears dropped, even then, in that far early world, 

Dropped on the soft face of the fresh-turned earth ; 
And curses gathered by despair were hurled 
By mortal sorrow in her primal birth. 

" But the young runner grasped his wreath, and died ; 

Antinoiis loved, and plunged him in the deep ; 
The goal attained, world's glory and world's pride, 
Life held no more, they said, and sank to sleep." 

The refined feeling and good taste displayed in 
these verses are qualities that they share in common 
with most of the contents of the volume in which 
they occur. 

Professor W. C. Lawton has collected the verses 
that a vagrant and impulsive Muse have from time 
to time constrained him to write, and published 
them in a volume of marked mechanical individ- 
uality. A series of illustrative cuts, happily fitted 
to the various texts, add to the attractiveness of the 
little book. Occasional pieces, classical reminis- 
cences, and impressions de voyage are the chief con- 
tents of a collection distinguished for culture, ideal- 
ity, and a certain naivete that does not detract from 
the general charm. As well as anything, perhaps, 
we like the graceful tribute to the memory of Pro- 
fessor Merriam, from which this extract is made : 

" Far and far away 

The sun is bright on Hellas' hills to-day ; 
And he who best of all our eager race 
The deep-cut word, the artist's line, could trace, 
Has reached the city of the violet crown, 
Only in dreamless sleep to lay him down. 
Too soon completed is his absent year. 
He knows not time nor distance, far or near : 
Perchance in loving thought he is among us here." 

Professor Merriam, it will be remembered, died a 
little over a year ago, at Athens, whither he had 
gone to spend his " sabbatical year " of vacation 
from Columbia College. It is true of Professor 
Lawton's verse that 

" Every chord has rung a thousand times 
To the firm touch of masters new and old," 

but this is no reason why they should remain un- 
plucked by the hands of the younger generation, 
and it is safe to add that they are not likely to suf- 
fer such neglect. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole has practised many 
forms of the literary craft, bringing to them all 
capacity and serious purpose. But none of his other 
ventures (as far as known to us) have been a source 
of quite the satisfaction with which we have read 
his recently-collected volume of verse. It includes 
four sections songs, sonnets, vers de soci&e, and 
pieces "in more serious mood," and it would be 
a pleasure to illustrate them all. Space failing, we 
will be content with a sonnet and this pair of qua- 
trains upon a familiar text from Dante " In la 
sua voluntade e nostra pace." 

" Peace ? Can we find it in this world of trial, 

Where battles fierce and every form of ill 
And pain and sorrow and hard self-denial 
Our checkered lives from birth to death must fill ? 



" Peace ? peace ? How sweet the word and tender I 

Its very sound should wrangling discords still ! 
And I might find it if I would surrender 
Myself and my will to His perfect will." 

It is a pity that one of these lines should be scant, 
but the defect is easily remedied. The sonnet we 
wish to quote is the second of two on " Beethoven." 

" I love the ocean's glorious symphonies 

In nature's everlasting solitudes ; 

The deep adagio of its peaceful moods ; 
Its light allegro when the white-caps rise ; 
Its minor when the sunset zephyr dies ; 

Its mighty major when the storm-cloud broods 

And sweeps the straining harp-string of the woods, 
And far on high the foaming water flies ! 

" So when Beethoven's magic music swells, 
Like voices of the angels heard in sleep, 
My spirit to its utmost depths is stirred 
As though a more majestic sea I heard, 
As though some sunken city's silver bells 
Swung palpitating in the purple deep." 

Mr. Dole's verse has melody rather than harmony, 
fancy rather than imagination, wit rather than hu- 
mor ; but its command of these lighter qualities is 
easy, and its utterance nearly always pleasing. 

Miss Litchfield's volume is well named " Mimosa 
Leaves," for its every page gives evidence of a sen- 
sitive nature, and the tremulous quality of the verse 
is one of its noticeable characteristics. The poems 
mostly short semi-impulsive pieces reveal an 
outlook upon life somewhat saddened, yet tempered 
by a faith that the dark mysteries of sorrow are 
somehow part of a divine plan, and that the heart 
of things is not pain. This attitude finds its fullest 
expression in two poems, " In the Hospital " and 
" Beyond the Hospital," too lengthy to be used for 
illustration. We select instead the characteristic 
stanzas entitled " Courage." 

" Hast thou made shipwreck of thy happiness ? 

Yet, if God please, 
Thou 'It find thee some small haven none the less, 

In nearer seas, 
Where thou may 'st sleep for utter weariness, 

If not for ease. 

" The port thou dreamedst of thou shalt never reach, 

Though gold its gates, 
And wide and fair the silver of its beach, 

For sorrow waits 
To pilot all whose aims too far outreach, 

Towards darker straits. 

" Yet so no soul divine thou art astray 

On this cliff's crown 
Plant thou a victor flag ere breaks the day 

Across night's brown, 
And none shall guess it doth but point the way 

Where a bark went down." 

Miss Litchfield's versification is often faulty, and 
she has not been well-advised in making the ana- 
paestic measure her favorite form. It is the most 
difficult of all our fundamental rhythms, and the 
failure to handle it is conspicuous in the present 
instance. 

That the poetic tradition of California, so welL 
established by Mr. Harte, Mr. Stoddard, and Mr. 
Miller, has not been permitted to lapse with the 



1896.]

passing of those men to other scenes is a fact made 
very evident by such a book as Miss Coolbrith's 
" Songs from the Golden Gate." Her work has 
poetic sensibility and vision, besides command of a 
considerable variety of lyric forms. There are, of 
course, occasional literary echoes in her work, no- 
ticeably in the case of " Oblivion," which is sure 
to recall Christina Rossetti's " Dreamland "; but, 
for the most part, Miss Coolbrith transmutes the 
gold of other singers into metal of her own. We 
cannot do better than quote her lines on "The 
Poet." 

" He walks with God upon the hills ! 
And sees, each morn, the world arise 
New-bathed in light of paradise. 

He hears the laughter of her rills, 
Her melodies of many voices, 
And greets her while his heart rejoices. 

She, to his spirit undefiled 

Makes answer as a little child ; 
Unveiled before his eyes she stands, 
And gives her secrets to his hands." 

A series of drawings by Mr. William Keith, the 
artist of " fields a-thrill with motion and with light," 
provide the book with illustration in a very attract- 
ive and unusual sense. 

Another volume of song, not obviously inspired, 
but at least graceful and refined comes to us from 
California. Miss Shearer's " The Legend of Au- 
lus " includes, besides the long titular poem, a num- 
ber of sonnets, ballads, and lyrics, the breathings 
of a sensitive and delicately-attuned spirit. Every 
poet pictures, at one time or another, some " city 
of the soul " in contemplation whereof is peace of 
mind. Miss Shearer's picture is suggested by the 
romantic wonderland of Shakespeare's creation. 

" What soft enchantment wraps my soul away ? 

The magic juice hath sure been spilt on me. 
Behold the sunken ships within the bay ! 

Prospero weaves his web of glamourie, 

Imprisoned Ariel struggles to be free, 
Miranda with her Prince talks heart to heart. 

This is the isle where I have longed to be, 
Most subtly tinted by the Master's art ; 
Here let me rest, nor ever from these shores depart." 

As for " The Legend of Aulus," it is a narrative 
poem of the early Christian period in Rome, based 
upon a story in the " Gesta Romanorum," sympathet- 
ically conceived, but somewhat pedestrian in move- 
ment. 

Chicago has its share in the poetical product of 
the past few months, for no less than four of the 
volumes upon our list come from men whom the 
Lakeside City claims for her own. She claims Mr. 
George Horton new United States Consul at 
Athens by virtue of his old connection with Chi- 
cago journalism, and of his " Songs for the Lowly," 
published some four years ago. " In Unknown 
Seas," the modest sheaf of stanzas he now sends us, 
embodies suggestions of travel and artistic fancies 
in gracefully-turned phrase, and is a creditable little 
book. Sometimes we come upon a curious semi- 
Swinburnian metrical effect, as in the following 
triplet : 



41 Hum till I come to you, wild honey bees 1 
Bide till I hide in yon, bloom-billowed seas ! 
Save but a cave for me, Hesperides I " 

More frequently we have such a sensuous nature- 
cameo as this : 

" Majestic hills, whose lofty inspiration 
Broods o'er the soul until it upward springs ; 
A languid clime, where passion's exaltation 
Like wine the blood to lyric frenzy stings ; 
And boundless seas that tempt imagination 
Afar from shore to try her petrel wings." 

It was only about three years ago that Mr. Ernest 
McGaffey published his first book of poems, and 
revealed a mind in sympathy with many aspects 
of natural beauty,' full of the lore of bird, and flower, 
and forest. A second volume from the same hand 
now recalls the first, and deepens the impression 
that it made. That the author does not take lightly 
the service of the Muse is evident from such heart- 
felt couplets as the following : 

" Nay ! dive thou deep in Nature's heart, 

And tear her leaves and grass apart ; 
" Wander thou forth in sun and rain 
To tread the paths of joy and pain ; 
" Live, toil, and strive, and keenly scan 

The mystery of thy fellow-man ; 
" And, most of all, know thou the spell 

Of Love's high heaven and dungeoned hell, 
" And then, if on thy natal morn 

A singer's soul was in thee born, 
" Perchance the anguish may be thine 
To touch the lips of song divine." 

If Mr. McGaffey has not quite " touched the lips 
of song divine," he has at least written gracefully 
and melodiously upon a considerable variety of 
themes. He is best in his treatment of nature, and 
there is not as much of nature in this collection as 
we could wish there had been. A favorable exam- 
ple of his work is this stanza : 

" On summer nights the yellow stars 

Shine through the watches held on high, 
Suspended from the countless spars 

Of cloud-fleets anchored in the sky, 
And wafted past upon the breeze 

Slow winding down from distant heights 
There comes the roll of far-off seas 
On summer nights." 

This bit of easy verse is typical of the whole. The 
author is too fluent a writer to touch the deeper 
chords of feeling, and a large fraction of his work 
bears no evidence of the labor limce that no poet 
should spare, even in his least ambitious flights. 

The Rev. F. W. Gunsaulus, in his "Songs of 
Night and Day," has experimented in many forms 
of versification, without attaining to mastery in any 
of them. He is at his best in such a simple strain 
as " Harvest and Hope," from which these stanzas 
are taken : 

" The tall dry reeds that pipe with tune 

What time the lyric breezes come, 
Were erstwhile flower-crowned loves of June, 

Yet in their richer days were dumb. 
" Dear days agone, when all my world 

Of dream and truth and love's desire 
Lay like a blossom closely whorled 
Within a soft green vase of fire

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



" Freed now by blooming, through the days 

Of summer sun and Nature's need 
I blame not any strange delays ; 
Life comes at length to be a seed. 

" Beyond the white and stormful dearth, 

Through snows and rain, comes fairy Spring ; 
Then autumn-seed will greet warm earth, 
And dear old birds again will sing." 

Unfortunately, Mr. Gunsaulus is not often as good 
as this. Much of his work is mere pretentious ver- 
biage, with little display of rhythmical art, and 
some of his pieces are too obviously occasional 
with all of haste and crudity that the term implies 
to deserve preservation. .' 

The modest disclaimer which prefaces " Under 
the Pines and Other Verses " 

"They have no plan, no moral hid, 

No prize for one who delves ; 
They came from out a happy heart, 
And seemed to sing themselves " 

is enough to disarm criticism, even with the critic 
who feels it his first duty to detect flaws of work- 
manship. Having never construed criticism to mean 
that ungrateful task, we are all the more free to 
welcome these simple and unaffected lyrics. They 
breathe many a tender sentiment, and point many 
a minor moral, in verse that is smooth and refined. 
These lines to " September " are as good as any- 
thing that we can select. 

" While autumn days grew brown and old, 
A wizard delved in mines of gold ; 
No idler he, by night, by day, 
He smiled and sang and worked away. 
And, scorning thrift, with lavish hand 
He cast his gold across the land. 

" The maples caught it ere it fell ; 
Witch-hazel turned before its spell ; 
The goldenrod's high plumes of green 
Were feathered with its yellow sheen ; 
While barberry bush and bitter-sweet 
Wore berries golden as the wheat." 

A graver note is sounded in an unusually successful 
paraphrase of the Ninetieth Psalm : 

" Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place 

Through generations past ; 
Before the mountains were brought forth, 

While earth was chaos vast ; 
Thou art from everlasting known 
To everlasting God alone." 

The imaginative note is boldly sounded in " The 
Tower," which prefaces Mrs. Nason's collection of 
poems, and recurs frequently in the pages that fol- 
low. 

" I am the tower of Belus the tower of old am I ! 
Under the rifting lines of the gloaming's tremulant sky, 
Under the shifting signs of the ages circling by, 
I stand in the might of the mighty the tower of Belus, I ! " 

Mrs. Nason's strains are not all trumpet-blasts like 
the above, and we soon come upon contrasting pass- 
ages, such as are offered by a " Slumber Song ": 

" Calm, un impassioned in thy wide dominions, 
Wilt thou relentless stay, and staying keep 
The restful shadows of thy purple pinions 
Aloof from mortals, sweet goddess, Sleep ? 



" We know the twilight brought thy soft caresses, 

But toil forbade us, and we might not rest ; 
We saw white poppies braided in thy tresses, 
We breathed their fragrance, leaning on thy breast ; 

" We dared not stay, lest, drowsy at its coming, 

We mock the midnight and the watch was set ; 
We longed to clasp thee, but some chill, benumbing 
Presence withheld us, and withholds us yet." 

We should like to give other examples of the au- 
thor's strong and melodious work, particularly the 
beautiful poem " Transmigration," or a part of the 
Homeric suggestion entitled "Two Faces," but 
enough has been quoted to illustrate the quality of 
a singer who has been happy in the selection of her 
themes, and singularly effective in finding for them 
suitable expression. The volume is one of the most 
noteworthy of the season. 

Mention of Mr. Savage's " First Poems and Frag- 
ments " has been long delayed, but it shall be none 
the less cordial for that. Mr. Savage is a lover of 
nature in the truest sense ; other minor poets allow 
their fancy to play with nature, and attune them- 
selves to it with more or less of effort, but the pres- 
ent writer penetrates into its deepest moods, and 
writes of it with almost Wordsworthian passion. 
Listen to him for a moment : 

" I have learned 

More from the hush of forests than from speech 
Of many teachers, more of joy at least, 
And that quick sympathy where joy has birth ; 
A thousand times called outward from myself 
By life at every point, ten thousand things 
Speaking at once in tones so sharp and sweet 
Their voice was pain, but pain as life is pain 
Beneath the over-chorus of the sky ; 
In silence finding joy to know myself 
Deep in the heart of nature and the world." 

Mr. Savage's poems are sonnets, groups of quat- 
rains or other stanzas, and snatches of rhymed or 
unrhymed heroics ; they are carefully wrought, for 
the most part, and even when they are not, there is 
always some felicitous phrase to arrest the attention. 
The volume, for a first one, is more than promising ; 
it represents a considerable measure of solid achieve- 
ment. 

A sheaf of sonnets, impressions de voyage, and 
dainty conceits, together with a long poem called 
" The Old-Fashioned Garden," make up the con- 
tents of Mr. Hayes's modest volume. It is nearly 
all good work, albeit conventionalized and literary 
of inspiration, and the title-piece is really a lovely 
poem. We may find room for a single stanza : 

" Nor lacks there music in this lovely close, 

The music of the oriole's soft lute, 
The gush of cadenced melody that flows 

And echoes from the blue-bird's fairy flute ; 
And here beside the fountain's mossy brink 
There rings the lilting laughter of the happy bobolink." 

This stanzaic form almost amounts to a new discov- 
ery. Its effect, repeated nearly fifty times, is inde- 
scribable ; the lengthened closing verse seems to 
react upon the preceding heroics, and to bestow upon 
them a new and entrancing rhythmic movement. 
The characteristic things in Mr. Roche's " Bal-

lads of Blue Water " are long poems descriptive of 
episodes in naval warfare, and cannot be illustrated 
by a brief quotation. Suffice it to say that they are 
stirring, but not noticeable for finish or poetical dic- 
tion. " A Business Transaction " is the amusing 
story of a sea-fight between the French and the 
Dutch, in which the Frenchman, having run short 
of powder, buys a fresh supply from his opponent, 
and fights merrily on until overpowered. 

" The great States-General, solemn folk, 

When old Van Dam came home next day, 
With his prizes in tow, forgave the joke, 
Or never perceived it who can say ? " 

There is some excellent fooling in " A Sailor's 
Yarn," which opens with these stanzas : 

" ' T was the good ship Gyascutus, 

All in the China seas, 
With the wind a-lee and the capstan free 
To catch the summer breeze. 

" ' T was Captain Porgie on the deck, 
To his mate in the mizzen hatch, 
While the boatswain bold, in the forward hold, 
Was winding his larboard watch." 

After this overture we need not be surprised at any- 
thing. 

Mr. Joseph O'Connor writes from experience of 
men and books, and has an eye for a poetic theme, 
but his treatment does not often rise to the height 
of the occasion. " Bringing the Fire from Delphi," 
for example, is a great subject, and calls for less 
pedestrian and commonplace verse than this : 

" They set within Diana's fane a simple stone to say 

Who ran to Delphi and returned within a single day : 

A gallant course ! Who would not wish for strength and skill 

so tried ? 

For loyalty and will to hold the path until he died ? 
For powers so disciplined to do the bests of strong desire ? 
And best of all to run for Man and carry sacred fire ! " 

A number of poems inspired by our Civil War oc- 
cupy the forefront of this collection, and into them 
the author has put much of his best work. 

" Apples of Istakhar " is the title given by Mr. 
William Lindsey to his poems, and explained by 
the following quatrain : 

" Life, like the apples of old Istakhar, 
A fruit half sweet, half bitter-baned doth bring ; 
Shade-cursed and sun-caressed by turns they were ; 
Shade-cursed and sun-caressed the songs I sing." 

Writing of " A Chance Shot," the author says : 

" I shot an hundred arrows carefully, 

And hit not once the disk of yellow gold ; 
I pierced it after, shooting fast and free, 
With hurried aim an arrow bent and old. 

" In vain I labored with an earnest pen 

To tell the truth a sunlit second found ; 
Long after came a careless mood, and then 
A few fit words the prisoned truth unbound." 

The application of this parable to Mr. Lindsey's 
verse is not exactly that he is most successful where 
least careful, for his pages are often marred by neg- 
lect of the most elementary principles of verse- 
writing, but rather that he does not hit the target 
very frequently. It seems to us that he has hit it 
in " The Cross," a sonnet. 



" Two rough-hewn timbers, crossed against the sky ; 
An awful form outside the city gate ; 
A ghastly sign of vengeance and of hate, 
To fright the errant slave's averted eye ; 
The last harsh Couch, whereon pale Crime doth lie, 
Seeking in vain a glance compassionate ; 
Symbol of death most dreadful dealt by Fate, 
Until, one April day, they lift on high 

" A thorn-crowned King, who dies upon a cross, 
Then bows a world before the sign of death, 
The curse is changed to blessing in a breath ; 
Its gleaming red lines knightly shields emboss ; 
On woman's breast it lies ; no day dawns bright. 
But gilds a cross-crowned temple with its light." 

Many of Mr. Lindsey's pieces are in light vein, and 
embody sentimental conceits in a pleasing way. 
And there is a note of sincerity in his work that 
partly atones for the technical shortcomings. 

" The Oaten Stop " series is the title given by the 
publishers to a collection of small volumes of Amer- 
ican verse, announced to appear at irregular inter- 
vals. The first two volumes of this series are at 
hand, being Mr. Richard Burton's " Dumb in June " 
and Miss Zitella Cocke's " A Doric Reed." Mr. 
Burton's pieces are for the most part mere snatches 
of song, in which the graver notes of the " lyric 
cry " are distinctly discernible. 

" There is only rest and peace 
In the City of Surcease 

From the failings and the waitings 'neath the sun, 
And the wings of the swift years 
Beat but gently o'er the biers, 
Making music to the sleepers every one. 
There is only peace and rest ; 
But to them it seemeth best, 
For they lie at ease and know that life is done." 

The author's mind is richly resonant to the notes of 
natural beauty, as the following autumnal stanza 
will illustrate : 

" Now is the year's recessional, for though 

Her robes are richer wrought than in the spring, 
What time the proud procession paced slow 

Up the vast church of Nature's fashioning, 
Soon moans these pulsing pomps left far behind 
Down unillumined aisles the requiem wind." 

Mr. Burton's work is promising, although he has not 
been quite successful as yet in differentiating the 
diction of the poet from that of the prosateur. 

Miss Cocke's verses are upon the level of ordi- 
nary magazine poetry, dealing with familiar themes 
in a way too graceful to give offence, yet never 
arousing more than an emotional ripple. A favor- 
able specimen is "The Comfort of the Pines." 

" I fain would seek that brotherhood, 
The monastery of the wood ; 
Earth-bound and tempest-tossed, yet given 
The blessed calm and peace of heaven ! 

"Tall hooded monks, in solemn band, 
Uplifting prayerful arms they stand, 
Intoning whispered orison 
And glad triumphant antiphon." 

Miss Cocke, like all other versifiers nowadays, 
writes sonnets, and a group devoted to several of 
the great musical composers evinces a genuine love 
of music. She even ventures a sonnet upon the 
sonnet, comparing it successively with a jewel, a

magic flute, a wreathed shell, a rose, and a night- 
ingale. It is very well done, especially the ending, 

" A captive nightingale in golden bars, 
Singing a song of rapture to the stars." 

Three Canadian singers come last upon our list. 
The poems of Miss Johnson derive an adventitious 
interest from the fact that they are written by an 
Indian girl, the daughter of a well-known Mohawk 
chief. As might be expected, these poems are dis- 
tinctly outdoor songs and ballads, and the barbaric 
strain of passion is not lacking. But they have also 
claims to consideration on their own account, for 
they display delicacy of sentiment and felicity of 
expression in a remarkable degree. We open the 
volume almost at random, and come upon such verse 
as this : 

" The velvet air, stirred by some elfin wings, 

Comes swinging np the waters and then stills 
Its voice so low that floating by it sings 

Like distant harps among the distant hills." 

" Velvet air " is a locution of which any poet might 
be proud, and it is but typical of the turn of phrase 
that enables many of these pieces to produce a really 
striking effect. We like particularly " The Flight 
of the Crows," from which one stanza may be taken. 
" O'er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead, 

Till lashed to life by storm-clouds, have they flown ? 
In what wild lands, in laggard flight have led 

Their aerial career unseen, unknown, 

' Till now with twilight came their cries in lonely mono- 
tone?" 

Mr. Douglas Campbell Scott's volume deserves 
far more attention than our space permits upon the 
present occasion, and a few words of emphatic and 
cordial praise must stand for the detailed examina- 
tion of its beauties that it would be a pleasure to 
make. Mr. Scott's poems are mainly nature-lyrics, 
and often attain to marked nobility of imaginative 
diction, as in these lines to Winter : 

" Then heap this sombre shoulder of the world 

With shifting bastions ; let thy storm winds blare ; 
Drift wide thy pallid gonfalon unfurled ; 

And arm with daggers all the desperate air." 

Mr. Bliss Carman, too, deserves better of us than 
this tag-end of an over-grown article, although one 
feels, in the case of his new volume as in the case 
of his earlier one, that his best work is still left un- 
collected. What he gives us just now is something 
less than a score of pieces ; some so lacking in fin- 
ish and lucidity that it seems a pity they should have 
been published, others carefully thought out and har- 
monized, and all charged with poetic energy of high 
potential. "Beyond the Gamut" is a long and 
beautiful poem, musical in theme and treatment, 
beneath which we should hardly be surprised to see 
the signature of Robert Browning. This poem will 
not bear excision, but we may do such violence to 
" Hack and Hew " without serious danger to its 
vitality :

BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS. 



For many years past Miss Eliza 
Allen Starr has been an important 
factor in the intellectual life of Chi- 
cago, having in many ways contributed to the ad- 
vancement of the city in culture. Her work, whether 
as a writer, a lecturer, or a social influence, has 
been quietly and unobtrusively performed, but has 
earned the gratitude not only of the large circle of 
her personal friends, but also of all who have had 
at heart the growth of an interest (so sadly needed 
in Chicago) in the things of the spirit. As a liter- 
ary worker, for example, she has published, in 
" Songs of a Lifetime," one of the most graceful 
and genuine books of verse that have yet come from 
this huge human hive. It is, however, as a lec- 
turer upon the history of art, and particularly of 
Christian art, that her activity has been most note- 
worthy, and it is in connection with this phase of 
her work that she has just published the sumptuous 
volume to which we now wish to call attention. All 
visitors to the Vatican are of course familiar with 
the frescoes of Raphael in the Camera della Seg- 
natura the four symbolical figures representing 
Theology, Poesy, Justice, and Philosophy, with the 
accompanying paintings of the Dispute, the School 
of Athens, Parnassus, and Jurisprudence. Miss 
Starr's book, which is entitled " Three Keys to the 
Camera della Segnatura of the Vatican," and is 
published by the author, gives us half-tone repro- 
ductions of these eight frescoes, with descriptive 
text, and, what is more to the point, includes outline 
drawings intended to serve as "keys " to all of the 
groups except the Jurisprudence, in which all the 
figures but two are purely symbolical. The author 
has taken much pains with her identifications, and 
has followed good authorities for the most part. 
She has accepted a few comparatively recent sug- 
gestions in this matter of identification, the substitu- 
tion of Simonides for the traditional Ovid, for ex- 
ample, in the Parnassus, this upon the authority of 
the late Heman Allen, of Philadelphia. Miss Starr 
lays no claim to credit for original investigation in

her work, " the discriminating, conscientious follow- 
ing of acknowledged authorities heing the only 
ground upon which I could venture to present it to 
the public or to those who have the care of educa- 
tional interests everywhere." " How many stand be- 
fore these pictures in the Vatican," she says, " with- 
out recognizing more than a few prominent person- 
ages, and without any clear idea of the intention of 
the artist in their arrangement, the story of the hu- 
man mind and the grand march of intellect through 
all ages, so wonderfully set forth in them, being, in 
consequence, wholly or almost lost." The " keys " 
now provided will enable a student to examine the 
paintings, or reproductions of them, intelligently, 
and many lovers of art will be grateful to Miss 
Starr for affording them this needed assistance. We 
should add that the work is a quarto, beautifully 
printed, and highly creditable, from the mechanical 
standpoint, to Western bookmaking. 

A romance ^ r ' Samuel Hubbard Scudder is 

from the world widely known in American science 
of butterfly. ag the aut hor of an exhaustive work 
on the " Butterflies of the Eastern United States 
and Canada." Its cost necessarily limits its distri- 
bution and usefulness to the few fortunate ones who 
are able to obtain it. For the benefit of the general 
reader, the author has recast into a single volume 
the most interesting and detachable portion of his 
elaborate treatise, and presented the new work un- 
der the attractive title of " Frail Children of the 
Air" (Houghton). The sections thus severed from 
their context are complete in themselves, while each 
is independent of the rest. As a whole, they con- 
vey a comprehensive idea of the character or history 
of the most conspicuous and lovely group in the 
entire insect tribe. We are wont to consider but- 
terflies as stupid creatures, living their lives, pursu- 
ing their ends, with the smallest stock of sensibility 
and intelligence. But Mr. Scudder corrects this false 
opinion, by attributing to them astonishing quali- 
ties. He goes so far as to treat of the psychology 
of a butterfly, giving an entire chapter to the novel 
subject. He even speaks of their individual tem- 
perament, and of their ability to become compan- 
ionable to humankind, or at least of their attempt 
to become so. They have their playful moods, it 
would seem, in which they sport with each other as 
lambs and kittens do. Some of the species are 
noted for their pugnacious disposition. The Amer- 
ican Coppers (Heodes hypophlceas) Mr. Scudder 
pronounces actually vicious. Some species are timid 
by nature, others fearless, and others cunning. It 
excites a desire to begin an immediate study of 
these flying flowers, to discover for oneself their 
remarkable capacities. The wondrous creatures, it 
appears, have a keen and delicate sense of smell, 
detecting odors unperceived by human beings ; but, 
what is equally strange, their sense of vision is dull. 
They recognize color only in masses, it is supposed ; 
hence the beauty of their wings cannot have resulted 
from natural selection, as Darwin argued. Certain 



species are capable of emitting aromatic odors, 
agreeable and otherwise, and others are able to pro- 
duce clicking or rustling sounds by striking their 
wings together when mentally (?) excited. The 
eggs of butterflies under the microscope reveal fea- 
tures of wonderful beauty. Mr. Scudder even talks 
of the " butterflies as botanists," but then he is an 
enthusiast and few who read this fascinating book 
will wish him otherwise. 



Stories and Matthew Arnold's complaint of the 

sketches of profound Gemeinheit of our Amer- 

New Orleans. j can C j t j e8 must haye been mo difi e d 

by an emphatic exception had he visited New Or- 
leans ; for the Crescent City certainly possesses a 
fair measure of the aesthetic charm which is born 
of a storied past, picturesque traditions, variety and 
richness of local color, and an exterior not yet 
ground down to the purely industrial and utilitarian 
dead level. In her " New Orleans : The Place and 
the People " (Macmillan), Miss Grace King sketches 
the history of her native place, and sounds its praises 
with pardonable enthusiasm. In the first, and to 
our thinking decidedly the best, half of the volume 
the treatment is historical; after this the writer 
lapses gradually into the descriptive, anecdotal, and 
reminiscential, giving her pen the loose rein, and 
leaving the reader little room for doubt as to her 
personal leanings during the " late unpleasantness." 
The opening chapters sketch concisely the history 
of the early Mississippi River explorations, the 
colonization of Louisiana, the founding of New 
Orleans, and the rapidly shifting fortunes of the 
city under the successive French, Spanish, and 
early American domination. An interesting chap- 
ter is devoted to the buccaneers, and a stirring and 
graphic, if slightly flamboyant, one to Jackson's de- 
feat of the British in 1815. The story of New Or- 
leans during the Civil War is entertainingly told, 
due justice being rendered to General Butler's 
somewhat drastic pacificatory measures from 
which, it seems, recalcitrant fair ones were by no 
means exempt, the General ungallantly acting up to 
his famous maxim, " The venom of the she-adder is 
as dangerous as that of the he-adder." " The little 
children in New Orleans," the author says, " when 
they are very good, are treated by their grand- 
mothers, not to the thrilling adventures of Blue 
Beard, but to tales of the Federal General in com- 
mand of the city during the war." The book is ac- 
curate and gracefully written, and the illustrations, 
by Miss Frances E. Jones, are acceptably done. 



Fallacies of 
race theories. 



William Dalton Babington's " Falla- 
cies of Race Theories " (Longmans ) 
is a well-written and interesting little 
book, consisting of seven essays upon historical sub- 
jects, intended to prove that what are usually called 
national characteristics are variable and acquired 
rather than inherited. As a whole, the essays are 
a protest against the extreme view, so well exem- 
plified in Mommsen, that race or national pecu- 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



liarity is the potent factor in history. Babington 
has died since these essays were written, and Mr. 
H. H. G. MacDonnell has arranged the material 
for publication in hook form. In his preface the 
editor says of the author : " He denies . . . [that] 
the present qualities of groups of men [are] almost 
wholly dependent on those of their ancestors long 
centuries before, and . . . have been transmitted 
by heredity down to this generation, from the re- 
mote past. It should be observed, however, that he 
does not enter at all ... into the very different 
question how far merely physical peculiarities are 
transmitted." These statements and quotations suf- 
ficiently indicate the purpose and character of the 
book. In it, many bright things deserving careful 
consideration are said. The argument is, however, 
as extreme as the theories opposed, and will as little 
stand criticism. Hatred of German claims (quite 
justified, we believe) leads to constant tacit admis- 
sion of what in argument he constantly denies viz., 
the existence of some true Germanic characteristics. 
The admission by the editor (and presumably by 
the author) that there exist well marked and hered- 
itary ethnic physical types, necessitates logically the 
admission of associated ethnic mental types. The 
minds of widely diverse physical types must differ. 
That nation is not a synonym of race, everyone 
ought to recognize ; almost everyone but Germans 
do recognize it. Not every man born in England 
will present a definite English type. Many peoples 
have dwelt in England, and are to-day mingled in 
its population. But the physical types of these peo- 
ples still exist ; with each is a mental type equally 
persistent. To underrate this is as great a blunder 
as to overstate it. The book is a deserved rebuke 
to a misused historical method ; but after perusing 
it, the reader will do well to take a little of Beddoe 
and Miss Simcox. 

Most readers will turn to Kenan's 
short eu lgy of his sister (" My Sis- 
ter Henrietta ": Roberts) with more 
curiosity as to Kenan than as to her whom the vol- 
ume especially commemorates. And most readers, 
too, as they go on, will be more interested in Kenan 
than in his sister, and at the end will probably have 
a more adequate idea of him than of her. The 
book has many of the qualities of his genius : it has 
touches of his sensibility, of his creative imagina- 
tion, of his somewhat patronizing analysis; here 
and there it has the glow of his style. But it quite 
fails, we must think, to give us a vitalized concep- 
tion of his sister. His sister, he tells us, was an 
elect soul, a woman of extreme distinction of char- 
acter and fineness of appreciation, a woman distin- 
guished, even remarkable, although unknown. So 
much can the historian inform us in black and 
white ; but it needs more to make us thoroughly 
realize the character of which he speaks, to make it 
alive for us with all the sweetness and power which 
he feels so strongly. And here, curiously enough, 
the great historian has not succeeded. He has not, 



in this short sketch, made his sister live once more 
for us, the exquisite, high-minded woman whom he 
remembers. She remains an abstraction ; we have 
here merely a note, a memorandum, which we must 
take on authority. Aside from this one point, the 
book has a great deal of interest, as we have already 
remarked, for the picture we have in it of the author 
himself. The reminiscences of his early days, of his 
studies, and of the development of his ideas, the old- 
time portrait by Henri Scheff er, the sketches by Ary 
Kenan of his Breton home and of his resting place 
in Palestine, the account of his sister's last days 
and of his own illness, these, taken perhaps rather 
as one would take fiction than as one takes history, 
will give real pleasure to many who can be content 
without the fierce and fiery interest of modern ro- 
mance. For such readers there will be a delicate 
interest in the group of people whom we have here 
the privilege of seeing for a moment, a group 
where there was genius both in science and in art, 
but so very, so curiously, different from anything 
which we American readers are ever likely to know 
from experience. 

Mr. Frank Preston Stearns's "The 
Midsummer of Italian Art" (Put- 
nam), contains five scholarly and 
well-considered appreciations of the works and the 
distinctive gifts, of Fra Angelico, Michel Angelo, 
Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Corregio, together 
with an introductory paper on Mediaeval Italy. Mr. 
Stearns has plainly written con amore, and his work 
throughout bears the impress of delicate observa- 
tion and analysis. The volume contains five pho- 
tographic plates, which impress us (with one excep- 
tion, a lovely head after Leonardo) as being, in 
point of execution, considerably below the merits 
and requirements of the text. Three brief papers 
are appended, in one of which the writer breaks a 
lance, on the subject of the Sistine Madonna and 
the Reading Madonna of Corregio, with that inge- 
nious critic, Giovanni Morelli scouting the latter's 
statements as to the profuse restorations visible on 
Raphael's matchless canvas, and refuting pretty 
effectually his absurd attribution of the Reading 
Madonna to Van Der Werff. With all respect to 
his almost German erudition and conscientious pur- 
suit of truth in his special brand of art-criticism, 
Signer Morelli seems to us to have peered into a 
rather inexcusable number of mares'-nests. Of the 
spirit of paradox, and ambition to upset long-current 
beliefs, we note no trace in Mr. Stearns's pages. 

A ,hort account " Modern German Literature " (Rob-

students," and attempts to tell what a well-educated 
man cares to know about German literature. Per-

haps the author has fairly well accomplished this 
purpose. In view of the admirable translation of 
Scherer's " History of German Literature," how- 
ever, the raison d'etre of the first chapter, entitled 
" The Origins," which in a compass of thirty-seven 
pages reviews the literary history of Germany down 
to the accession of Frederick the Great, may fairly 
he questioned. The treatment is certainly too hrief 
to satisfy even the general reader ; and especially, 
considering the title, the same space devoted to a 
survey of the political, intellectual, and moral con- 
dition of Germany in 1740 would have seemed in 
better proportion. The greater part of the book is 
devoted to Leasing, Goethe, and Schiller. The ac- 
count of them is clear, and shows the author's 
knowledge at first hand. It is said that Grimm 
himself no longer insists upon his theory that the 
first thought of Iphigenie auf Tauris was due to 
Gluck's request for the text of a cantata, and the 
author might well have emphasized the tragic neces- 
sity of " Maria Stuart " rather than its obvious pa- 
thos. The chapter on " Faust " is clear, and should 
prove to the student a useful analysis of the two 
parts of the drama. The treatment of Heine is 
also satisfactory and suggestive. Indeed, it may 
fairly be said of the whole book that the author has 
realized his ambition of being " helpfully suggestive 
to the lovers of pure literature." 



Wild places 
in England. 



The comely volume entitled " Wild 
England of To-day " (Macmillan), by 
Mr. C. J. Cornish, is not unworthy 
of a niche in the library shelves beside the works 
of Richard Jefferies ; and indeed one could easily 
select passages from it that might well have come 
from the pen of the inspired naturalist of Cote 
Farm. There are, even in populous England, patches 
enough of the earth's surface where Nature bids 
man keep his distance ; while since the repeal of the 
Corn Laws, and the consequent rise of what Ricar- 
dians call the margin of cultivation, the increase of 
waste heath and pasture-land has gone on apace. 
The wild places described by Mr. Cornish, under 
such chapter-headings as "The Southern Cliffs," 
" The Pine and Heather Country," " Surrey Scenes," 
" Round the Great White Horse," " In High Suf- 
folk," " Somersetshire Coombs," " Climbing In En- 
gland," etc., range broadly from the Southern Cliffs 
to the Yorkshire Fen. Mr. Speed's drawings are 
mostly spirited and well-conceived, while the purely 
photographic plates are notably good. For a friend 
who loves men like Jefferies and our own John Bur- 
roughs, Mr. Cornish's book will not be amiss. 

Still another school history of the 
United States is added to the recent 
excellent manuals of Messrs. Fiske, 
Thomas, and Montgomery, by three Southern writ- 
ers, Messrs. Cooper, Estill, and Lemmon. The 
present work (Ginn) differs from some of the his- 
tories used in the schools of the South, being schol- 
arly, temperate, and usually fair in the treatment

of disputed points. But the evident desire to avoid 
wounding the susceptibilities or encountering tha 
prejudices of Southerners has made the narrative 
colorless. This is, of course, infinitely better than 
a wrong or partisan coloring. Both sides are pre- 
sented, and presented as if they were both right ; 
the scholar who learns from this book will be able 
to be just to the other section, even if his confidence 
in his own side is not weakened. The authors have 
no special gift at presenting the solid matter of our 
history in such a way as to win the attention and 
interest of children ; and in this respect the book 
suffers by contrast with some of its rivals. The 
style is rather heavy, and the ordinary child of 
thirteen will be repelled by the dry paragraphs that 
would be excellent in a book addressed to adults. 
The maps, illustrations, and pedagogical apparatus 
are good, and will enable the good teacher to get 
excellent results from the book. 



Tennyson ^ n Professor Hugh Walker's study 

Browning, of three " Greater Victorian Poets " 

and Arnold. (Macmillan) the author estimates 

Matthew Arnold along with Tennyson and Brown- 
ing, on the ground that Arnold "is so exquisite 
within his range that he can be placed nowhere ex- 
cept in the first rank." The order of the book is 
to follow the chronological consideration of the poe- 
try of each author, with a treatment of the relation 
of these poets to the spirit and thought of their time. 
Separate chapters are consequently devoted to illus- 
trating and discriminating their feeling for nature, 
the influence of contemporary science upon them, 
their social and political aspects, and finally the re- 
ligious faith and doubt of each, as found in their 
works. The method is that of the expositor, not 
the controversialist nor the appraiser. In general, 
statements are supported by the evidence of liberal 
quotation. The language, too, is clear and suffi- 
ciently exact. There are numerous examples of 
felicity of phrase, in which the point of view is set 
forth in a few vivid words. While the superior 
greatness in range, and possibly in power, of Ten- 
nyson and Browning is acknowledged, Arnold is 
discovered to be the poet of the three whose feeling 
for nature is most unalloyed, who shows most ob- 
viously the influence of the scientific appeal to rea- 
son, whose interest in society is always deep and 
strong, and who reflects most fully the skeptical 
tendencies of his age. He is called " the poet of 
doubt, stretching his hands through the dark towards 
a faint far-away glimmer." No ordinary student of 
the Victorian era will fail to find his vision of these 
poets clearer, and his impressions better defined, 
after assimilating this book.

The book is an exceedingly readable one, lively, 
anecdotal, and picturesque, and a solidly-informing 
one withal containing a store of suggestive, well- 
verified facts as to the economic condition and pros- 
pects of a section of our country that now seems 
destined for a career of prosperous industrial activ- 
ity undreamed of under the past regime. The sal- 
ient aspects of life in this New South are presented 
by Mr. Ralph with a dioramic distinctness that 
leaves the reader with an agreeable sense of having 
journeyed thither himself. The book is profusely 
and charmingly illustrated. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Texts for the study of English literature multiply 
apace. Macaulay's essay on Milton, edited by Mr. J. 
G. Croswell, and Webster's " First Bunker Hill Ora- 
tion," edited by Mr. F. N. Scott, are admirable additions 
to the " English Classics " of Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. Messrs. Ginn & Co. send the most satisfactory 
edition we have yet seen of Defoe's " Journal of the 
Plague Year," edited by Mr. Byron S. Hurlbut. From 
Messrs. Maynard, Merrill, & Co. we have Burke's 
" French Revolution," and the first chapter of Macau- 
lay's " History of England," anonymously edited, and 
therefore open to grave suspicion. Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons publish an excellent edition of Irving's 
"Sketch Book," edited by Mr. W. L. Phelps. "The 
Vicar of Wakefield," with editorship unacknowledged, 
comes from the American Book Co. Messrs. Silver, 
Burdett, & Co. publish as a poetry reader for children, 
" Nature in Verse," compiled by Miss Mary I. Lovejoy. 

A number of German texts for school and college use 
have recently appeared. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
publish " German Historical Prose," edited by Dr. Her- 
mann Schoenfeld; Lessing's "Nathan," edited by Pro- 
fessor H. C. G. Brandt; "Ein Besuch bei Charles Dick- 
ens im Sommer 1857," by Hans Christian Andersen, 
edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bernhardt; and a new edition of 
Mr. L. M. Stern's " Studien und Plaudereien." From 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we have ScheffePs " Trom- 
peter von Sakkingen," edited by Miss Carla VVencke- 
bach; Lessing's "Emilia Galotti," edited by Dr. Max 
Winkler; and Bendix's " Die Hochzeitsreise," edited by 
Miss Natalie Schiefferdecker. The American Book Co. 
send three stories by Herr Heinrich Seidel, edited by 
Dr. Ernst Richard; while from Messrs. Maynard, Mer- 
rill & Co. we have " Das Deutsche Ordensland Preus- 
sen," by Herr von Treitschke, edited by Mr. W. S. Lyon. 

Two volumes of " Coutes et Le"gendes " by H. A. 
Guerber (American Book Co.) are written for beginners 
in French study, with the design of making it more of 
a pleasure and less of a bugbear than it commonly 
proves. The stories are from the folk-lore and fairy 
tales of many nations, and take as wide a range as from 
the English nursery favorite, " Les Trois Ours," to " Une 
Drachme de Langue " the Slavonic version of the an- 
cient story which appears in another form in Shake- 
speare's " Merchant of Venice." Each volume is sup- 
plied with a simple but adequate vocabulary, and the 
books may be recommended as fulfilling their purpose. 

President John M. Coulter of Lake Forest Univer- 
sity addressed the Botanical Seminar of the University 
of Nebraska last May upon the subject of " The Botan- 



ical Outlook." The address is now printed in pamph- 
let form, and in a limited edition, with one of the copies 
of which we have been favored. The main object of 
the address is to indicate the dangerous and the hope- 
ful tendencies of modern botanical research. The for- 
mer are described as the tendencies towards narrow- 
ness, towards certainty, to mistake power of acquisition 
for power to do something, to immature research, and 
to what the author calls " ritualism." The latter are 
the tendencies to regard botany as a biological science, 
to study in the great laboratory of Nature, to specific 
demonstration, to use the imagination, and to regard 
plants as resultants. Upon each of these topics, the 
author delivers himself at length, preaching the sound- 
est of doctrine in the clearest and most forcible way. 

Many students and teachers of history will be grate- 
ful to the Directors of the Old South Work for repub- 
lishing their " Old South Leaflets " in volume form. 
They are bound together, twenty-five leaflets to a vol- 
ume, and two volumes have thus far been sent us. 
There will doubtless be enough for a third volume be- 
fore very long. It is an almost priceless boon to the 
teacher to place in his possession, at so moderate a 
price, these collections of original documents, and the 
good work deserves the most cordial recognition. 

Among recent French texts and manuals we note the 
following: An abridged edition of "Les Misdrables" 
(" episodes and detailed descriptions only omitted "), 
edited by M. A. de Rougemont; a "First Course in 
French Conversation," by M. C. P. Du Croquet; and 
" La Frontiere," a tale by M. Jules Claretie, edited by 
Dr. C. A. Eggert; these three published by Mr. W. R. 
Jenkins. From the American Book Co. we have an 
" Academic French Course," in two volumes, the work 
of M. Antoine Muzzarelli. Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
publish a small volume of " Selections for French Com- 
position," prepared by Mr. C. H. Grandgent; and a 
reader called " Lectures Courantes," with exercises, ed- 
ited by M. C. Fontaine. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

" The Life and Adventures of George Augustus 
Sala " (Scribner) is now republished in a form slightly 
different from the earlier one, and with no indication of 
the fact that it is not a new work. 

" The National Cyclopedia of American Biography " 
makes an authorized announcement of the fact that the 
" Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc," published last 
year in one of the magazines, were written by " Mark 
Twain." 

A new edition of Sir George Dasent's " Tales from 
the Fjeld " that is, from the Norwegian of Asbjorn- 
son with more than a hundred illustrations by Mr. 
Moyr Smith, has just been published by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 

" The Modern Readers' Bible," edited by Mr. R. G. 
Moulton, now includes an edition of " Ecclesiasticus," 
otherwise known as " The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of 
Sirach " (Macmillan). Some readers will rub their eyes 
at this, but Mr. Moulton deserves cordial praise for thus 
directing attention to one of the most important of the 
apocryphal scriptures. 

Madame Stepniak intends to prepare a record of the 
life and work of her husband. Prince Kropotkiii will

and Professor York Powell, Mr. Edward Garnett, and 
Malatesta, the Italian Anarchist, will contribute chap- 
ters, respectively, on " Stepniak " as a critic, " Stepniak " 
as a political writer, and " Stepniak " in Italy. 

" A Tale of Two Cities " and Edwin Drood " are 
brought together in the latest volume of the " dollar " 
Dickens published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. The 
same publishers put together into a single volume of 
their library of standard English fiction what are prob-

" Headlong Hall " and " Nightmare Abbey," with an 
introduction by Mr. Saintsbury. 

The Department of State at Washington has begun 
a series of calendars to aid in the documentary study 
of American history. A Commission has also been es- 
tablished by the American Historical Association to deal 
with materials not in the possession of the Department, 
and thus to supplement the work. This Commission 
consists of Professor J. F. Jameson, Dr. Douglas Brym- 
mer, Mr. Talcott Williams, Professor W. P. Trent, and 
Professor F. J. Turner, all good men and true, from 
whom we may expect work of the most scholarly kind. 

Dr. William H. Furness died at his home in Phila- 
delphia on the thirtieth of January, having reached the 
great age of ninety-three. He was born in Boston, 
April 20, 1802, and got his education in various " dame's 
schools," the Latin School, Harvard College, and the 
Cambridge Theological School. As a child, he went to 
school with Emerson, one year younger than himself. 
He was ordained in Philadelphia in 1825, becoming the 
first regular pastor of the First Unitarian Church. This 
pastorate he retained for just half a century, when he 
retired as pastor emeritus. During the troublous years 
preceding the Civil War, he made himself conspicuous 
as one of the leading champions of the abolitionist cause. 
His numerous writings were mostly of a religious char- 
acter, and had for their chief aim an interpretation of 
the New Testament which accepted the miracles as 
natural occurrences. He also published several trans- 
lations of German prose and poetry. His children in- 
cluded William, an artist who died in early manhood, 
Dr. Horace Furness, our great Shakespearian scholar, 
Mr. Frank Furness, the architect, and Mrs. Wister, who 
has translated and adapted so many German novels. 

In the " Publishers' Weekly " for January 25 may be 
found the annual summary of our literary output that 
has long been a distinctive feature of that indispensable 
journal. We glean from this laboriously-prepared com- 
pilation some facts of interest. The total number of 
book-titles for 1895 is 5469, nearly a thousand more 
than for 1894, and 335 in excess of 1893, the most pro- 
ductive year hitherto known. The year 1895 was one 
for publishers rather than for authors, by which is meant 
that the increase was largely in the direction of reprints 
of standard literature. The figures for the three de- 
partments of literature proper, as compared with the 
corresponding figures for 1894, make a startling show- 
ing. New fiction grew from 573 to 1050, new poetry 
from 133 to 294, and new " literary history and miscel- 
lany " from 208 to 455. We are told that the " new 
woman " or " anti-marriage " novel " reached its climax 
of repulsiveness during the year. The tide that carried 
this hybrid creature to our shores is receding, we are 
glad to note, as rapidly as it rushed in. The American 
literature of this class is as ephemeral as its writers, 
whose audacity alone gave them prominence for the 
moment. No American novelist known to fame needs 
as yet to blush for his literary offspring."

HAVE JUST PUBLISHED: 

THE LIFE OF THOMAS HUTCHINSON, 

Last Royal Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. By JAMES K. HOSMEB, author of " Young 
Sir Henry Vane " and " Samuel Adams " in the American Statesmen Series. With a Portrait of 
Hutchinson, a View of his Boston Home, and a fac simile Letter. 8vo, gilt top, $4.00. 
In this book Dr. Hosmer adds to the obligations under which he placed us by his excellent works on Young 
Sir Henry Vane and Samuel Adams. Hutchinson was the last of the Royal Governors of Massachusetts, and in 
many important respects the best. While loyal to the crown, he was steadfastly true to the best interests of the 
Colony; but because he was a Loyalist he was obliged to withdraw from the country, and very scant justice has 
been done to his sterling virtues. Dr. Hosmer's book is written with admirable fairness and from full informa- 
tion; it adds materially to our knowledge of the Revolutianary era, and restores Governor Hutchinson to his 
rightful place, both as a thoroughly capable magistrate and a thoroughly noble man. 

MORAL EVOLUTION. 

By GEOKGE HARRIS, D.D., Professor in the Andover Theological Seminary. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

CONTENTS: Evolution and Ethics; Personality in Society; The Moral Ideal : The Good; The Moral Law: The

The Christian Ideal: Personal; The Christian Ideal: Social; Degeneration; Personal Regeneration; Social Re- 
generation: Economics; Social Regeneration: Institutions; Ethics and Theology; Christianity and Evolution. 

Anyone interested in studies that relate immediately to the highest welfare of mankind, personal and social, 
cannot fail to see at once that here is a book which challenges, nay, most persuasively solicits, his earnest atten- 
tion; and whoever knows the quality of Dr. Harris's thinking, and the forcible grace of his style, will recognize 
in this announcement the promise of a work of remarkable value and profound attractiveness.

Mr. Robinson, who told so well the story of Vermont for the series of American Commonwealths, and in " Dan- 
vis Folks " reproduced with rare knowledge and skill some phases of the Vermont rural life of two generations 
ago, in his new book proves his right to join the goodly ranks of the out-door geniuses Thoreau, Burroughs, 
Torrey, Bolles, etc. He discusses special aspects of out-door life the year round, as he writes with minute observ- 
ation and a profound interest in Nature.

STUDIES OF CHILDHOOD. 

By JAMES SULLY, M.A., LL.D., Professor of Philosophy of 
Mind and Logic, University College, London ; author of 
"Outlines of Psychology," " The Human Mind," etc. 8vo, 
cloth, $2.50. 

Professor James Sully's delightful " Studies of Childhood," some of 
which have appeared in the " Popular Science Monthly " during the past 
year, are now issued in book form. They make an ideal popular scien- 
tific book. Written by a psychologist, whose other works have won 
him a high position, these studies proceed on sound scientific lines in 
accounting for the mental manifestations of children, yet they require 
the reader to follow no laborious train of reasoning, and the reader who 
is in search of entertainment merely will find it in the quaint sayings 
and doings with which the volume abounds. 

GREENLAND ICEFIELDS, AND LIFE IN 
THE NORTH ATLANTIC. 

With a New Discussion of the Causes of the Ice Age. By 
G. FREDERICK WRIGHT, D.D., LL.D., F.G.S.A., author of 
" The Ice Age in North America," etc., and WARREN 
UPHAM, A.M., F.G.S.A., late of the Geological Surveys of 
New Hampshire, Minnesota, and the United States. With 
numerous maps and illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 
The immediate impulse to the preparation of this volume arose in 
connection with a trip to Greenland by Professor Wright in the summer 
of 1894 on the steamer Miranda. While preparing to make the most of 
this excursion, much difficulty was encountered in collecting the facts 
which one would most like to know concerning this still mysterious 
land. The work, therefore, aims to give within modern limits a com- 
prehensive view of the scenery, the glacial phenomena,, the natural his- 
tory, the people, and the explorations of Greenland. The photographs, 
some sixty in number, are all original, and the maps have been prepared 
to show the latest state of knowledge concerning the region. The chap- 
ters treat of The Ice of the Labrador Current ; The Coast of Labrador ; 
Spitzbergen Ice in Davis Strait ; The Author's Excursions on the 
Coast; The Coast in Detail; The Greenland Eskimos; Europeans in 
Greenland ; Explorations of the Inland Ice ; The Plants of Greenland ; 
The Animals of Greenland ; Changes of Level since the Advent of the 
Glacial Period ; and a final chapter giving a summary of the bearing of 
the facts upon Glacial Theories. The work is of both popular and sci- 
entific interest. There is no other work upon the subject so compre- 
hensive.

truth regarding California as this is." New York Evening Post. 

" To all persons intending to visit the most beautiful and salubrious

. . . a complete and trustworthy guide-book." New York Sun. 

" Deserves hearty approval, and should do much to popularize a sub- 
ject of the greatest interest." New York Tribune.

THE SUN. 

By C. A. YOUNG, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of Astronomy in 
Princeton University. New and revised edition, with nu- 
merous illustrations. Vol. 34, International Scientific Series. 
12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

Since the original publication of this book, in 1881, great advances 
have been made in our knowledge of the sun ; and although, in subse- 
quent editions, notes and appendices have kept the work fairly up to 
date, the author has deemed it best to thoroughly revise it, embodying 
the notes in the text, and rewriting certain portions. This edition is 
therefore representative of the solar science of to-day, including import- 
ant spectroscopic discoveries which have been made during the revision. 

MOVEMENT. 

By E. J. MAREY, Member of the Institute and of the Acad- 
emy of Medicine ; Professor at the College of France ; au- 
thor of " Animal Mechanism." Translated by ERIC PRITCH- 
ARD, M.A. With 200 illustrations. Vol. 73, International 
Scientific Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

The present work describes the methods employed in the extended 
development of photography of moving objects attained in the last few 
years, and shows the importance of such researches in mechanics and 
other departments of physics, the fine arts, physiology, and zoology, and 
in regulating the walking or marching of men and the gait of horses. 

THE STORY OF THE INDIAN. 

By GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL, author of "Pawnee Hero 
Stories," " Blackfoot Lodge Tales," etc. The first volume 
in the Story of the West series, edited by RIPLEY HITCH- 
COCK. With 16 full-page illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" It must not be supposed that the volume is one only for scholars 
and libraries of reference. It is far more than that. While it is a true 
story, yet it is a story none the less abounding in picturesque descrip- 
tion and charming anecdote. We regard it as a valuable contribution 
to American literature." New York Mail and Express. 

"Among the various books respecting the aborigines of America, Mr. 
Grinnell's book easily takes a leading position. He takes the reader 
directly to the camp-fire and the council, and shows us what the Amer- 
ican Indian really is. ... A book which will convey much knowledge 
respecting a race which is now fast passing away." Boston Commer- 
cial Bulletin. 

OLD FAITHS AND NEW FACTS. 

By WILLIAM W. KINSLEY, author of " Views on Vexed Ques- 
tions." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In this timely, forcible, and important book the author aims to show 
how far facts brought to light by modern scientific research modify, 
and how far confirm, the time-honored faiths of Christendom. He 
applies the new tests to those three most vital questions of the hour : 
Does prayer avail ? Was Christ divine ? Is man immortal ? These gen- 
eral subjects, with the many questions which they include, are discussed 
in an entirely modern spirit, with a freshness and range of knowledge 
which render the book instructive, stimulating, and immediately valu- 
able. 

CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY. 

By ENRICO FERRI, Professor of Criminal Law, Deputy in the 
Italian Parliament, etc. A new volume in the Criminology 
Series, edited by W. DOUGLAS MORRISON. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

In this volume, Professor Ferri, a distinguished member of the Italian 
Parliament, deals with the conditions which produce the criminal pop- 
ulation, and with the methods by which this anti-social section of the 
community may be diminished. His view is that the true remedy against 
crime is to remove individual defects and social disadvantages where it 
is possible to remove them. He shows that punishment has compara- 
tively little effect in this direction, and is apt to divert attention from 
the true remedy the individual and social amelioration of the popu- 
lation as a whole. 

THE WRONG MAN. 

By D. GERARD, author of "An Arranged Marriage," "The 
Rich Miss Riddell," etc. No. 186, Town and Country 
Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cts.; cloth, $1.00. 
This is one of the most entertaining books which this writer of whole- 
some, interesting fiction has offered her wide circle of admirers.

THE CRITIC AS PICKER AND 
STEALER. 

Certain of the abuses of contemporary peri- 
odical criticism are energetically set forth by 
Mr. William Knight in the February issue of 
" The Nineteenth Century." Mr. Knight's pa- 
per is entitled " Criticism as Theft," and dis- 
cusses the various forms of filching, more or 
less disguised, by which the journalistic hack 
gets the attention of the public, and profits at 
the expense of those upon whom he preys. The 
author sometimes strains a point to bring the 
abuse with which he is at the moment occupied 
under the category of robbery, as when he says 
that the author who makes a valuable contri- 
bution to literature is entitled to a reward, and 
adds : "If the return of that reward is pre- 
vented by capricious, or ignorant, or reckless 
criticism, the critic has stolen from the author, 
quite as truly as if he had robbed him of his 
purse." But if this practise is not theft, it is 
something quite as bad, and deserves all the 
censure bestowed upon it. " The robbery of 
a just reputation is much more serious than is 
the theft of money, or of material property ; 
and the unjust praise and the false dispraise 
of the critic is one of the worst kinds of theft 
that this world has had to endure." Coleridge 
took much the same view of this matter when 
he thus characterized critics of the wantonly 
malignant type : 

" No private grudge they need, no personal spite : 
The viva sectio is its own delight ! 
All enmity, all envy, they disclaim, 
Disinterested thieves of our good name : 
Cool, sober murderers of their neighbor's fame." 

The abuse becomes even more serious when 
not merely ignorance or reckless flippancy, 
but partisanship or personal bias inspires the 
review of some book. This is what Mr. Knight 
says about it : " Many a review philosophical, 
political, scientific, theological, and literary 
has hitherto been tainted with this bias. An 
a priori judgment has been passed on the mer- 
its of a book which the critic had not read. It 
has been judged by its title, its contents, its 
preface, or its author's name. Every literary 
man must have seen scores of such notices, pert, 
opinionative, shallow, useless ; or, on the other 
hand, fulsome, and therefore worse than use- 
less." We may once more back Mr. Knight's 



130 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



opinion with a passage from Coleridge this 
time a prose selection, but for that none the 
less vigorous in its impeachment. " As soon 
as the critic betrays that he knows more of 
his author than the author's publications could 
have told him ; as soon as from this more in- 
timate knowledge, elsewhere obtained, he avails 
himself of the slightest trait against the au- 
thor ; his censure instantly becomes personal 
injury, his sarcasms personal insults. He ceases 
to be a critic and takes on him the most con- 
temptible character to which a rational crea- 
ture can be degraded, that of a gossip, back- 
biter, and pasquillant: but with this heavy 
aggravation, that he steals the unquiet, the de- 
forming passions of the world into the museum ; 
into the very place which, next to the chapel 
and oratory, should be our sanctuary and se- 
cure place of refuge ; offers abominations on 
the altar of the Muses, and makes its sacred 
paling the very circle in which he conjures up 
the lying and profane spirit." Anyone who 
has occasion to do much reading in contem- 
porary criticism may often discern between the 
lines of a review some such syllogism as the 
following : No person holding certain opinions 
upon politics, or art, or religion, can possibly 
say anything worth heeding upon any subject 
whatsoever. N. N. is a person holding such 
opinions. This book of his upon, let us say, 
hydraulic engineering, must therefore receive 
short shrift and no mercy. This illustrates, it is 
true, an exaggerated form of the evil under dis- 
cussion ; a more common form is that in which 
some unimportant passages in the book, obnox- 
ious to the critic, is singled out for attack, while 
the substance of the work is utterly ignored. 

Another form of current " criticism," which 
comes nearer than those as yet mentioned 
to being theft in the literal sense, is thus de- 
scribed by Mr. Knight: "A critical 'notice,' 
written to display mere deftness or nimble- 
ness of wit, ingenious repartee, power of sar- 
casm or rejoinder, is not criticism at all. Sup- 
pose a nimble - witted person skims a book; 
turning its pages in a listless mood, he finds 
some information that is new to him. He notes 
this, and goes on to read more. He finds some 
errors, and then proceeds to use the informa- 
tion, which he has received from the book itself, 
against its author ; just as a clever surface 
society-talker, wholly ignorant of a subject, can 
often * pick the brains ' of one who knows it, 
while he is speaking, and give him back in a 
torrent of verbosity the very ideas he was slowly 
and modestly expressing." There is a good 



deal of this sort of fraudulent criticism afloat, 
and some writers acquire a critical reputation 
based almost wholly upon the cleverness with 
which they succeed in " showing off " with the 
subject of some book for a text. The passage 
just quoted reminds us of an incident recently 
related. A journalist who had seen a good 
many varieties of life at close quarters spent an 
evening with an eminent novelist. After a 
while, the novelist said to his guest : "I want 
your opinion of a story I have just written." 
The story was read, and approval duly ex- 
pressed. " But," said the journalist, " the sub- 
stance of your story seems strangely familiar to 
me." " Yes," replied the novelist, " you told 
me the story yourself." 

Perhaps the only sort of " criticism " that 
may in the strictest sense be accounted theft is 
that in which the reviewer relies mainly upon 
the reviews already published by others of his 
craft. To parade as one's own the opinions of 
others, to catch the drift of criticism as ex- 
pounded in the more authoritative journals, 
reproducing its leading ideas in slightly altered 
form, is a practice for which no defence is pos- 
sible. The critic who takes his profession se- 
riously will, of course, carefully refrain from 
reading what others have said of a book until 
he has framed his own independent judgment 
of the work in question, and even then will 
have to be constantly on his guard to resist the 
natural impulse to make his dicta conform to 
those which he cannot keep from filtering into 
his consciousness in a hundred insidious ways. 
Even the shifting currents of public opinion 
upon the larger aspects of literary art are a 
constant source of danger to the critic, how- 
ever conscientious he may be. When current 
literature shows a distinct trend toward real- 
ism, or romanticism, or didacticism, or sexual- 
ism, it is difficult to avoid being swayed by the 
movement, however fixed may be the critic's 
canons, and however stoutly he may be pre- 
pared to do battle for the lasting as against the 
ephemeral. We still get a good deal of bell- 
wether guidance, even from the best-intentioned, 
for critics are as gregarious as other people, 
and find it quite as hard to run counter to the 
prevailing literary fashions. 

With one part of Mr. Knight's argument we 
are unable to agree. He condemns the review 
which is frankly descriptive and extractive on 
the ground that it is a theft from both author 
and public ; from the former because it injures 
his sales, from the latter because it deprives 
of the opportunity of knowing, " in its integ-

rity," what the author has to say. It is a cu- 
rious logical twist that can find robbery in the 
act of summarizing a book for readers many 
of whom are too busy to get at it in any other 
way. As far as our observation goes, such 
precis-writing stimulates rather than retards 
the sale of the books selected for treatment ; 
the persons who are content to accept the part 
for the whole are mostly those who would never 
dream of purchasing the book concerned, while, 
on the other hand, the number of those who are 
by a skilful summary made curious to know 
the book, and actually purchase it, make up 
many times over for the few who might have 
become purchasers had it not been for the 
friendly offices of the reviewer in selecting for 
them enough of its contents to satisfy their curi- 
osity. So far are we from deprecating this form 
of review, that we wish there might be a great 
deal more of it. More, perhaps, than from 
any other cause, popular criticism suffers from 
the feeling of the critic that, however lacking 
in knowledge, he is bound to take the judicial 
attitude, and, instead of giving his readers an 
idea of what the book is really like, he must 
express a decided opinion upon its merits. As 
it is obviously impossible for the newspaper 
reviewer, called upon to deal with books upon 
all sorts of subjects, to have an opinion of any 
value concerning most of them, it would be a 
decided improvement for him to remain con- 
tent with the descriptive summary that almost 
any fairly intelligent person can make. In 
other words, the work of judicial and authori- 
tative criticism should be left to the reviews 
that can command the services of hundreds of 
specialists, and are known to entrust to com- 
petent hands the books sent to such reviews for 
examination. 



THE SONNET. 



As, poised on slender stem, some perfect rose 
Unfolds its delicate petals to the air, 
Till lo! a little rounded life is there, 

Amid the sweetness that its breath bestows; 

Even thus, within the sonnet's classic close, 
Beyond whose limits it may never fare, 
The thought should shape itself until it wear 

A rhythmic garb of tumult or repose. 

A sonnet is a lover's laughing song; 
A sigh, a symphony, a lyric brief; 

A throb of mighty music from the sea; 
It seeks the stars, or brook-like bounds along; 
'T is now a cry of passion-throated grief, 
And now an epic in epitome.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"THE MIDSUMMER OF ITALIAN ART."-SOME 

CORRECTIONS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have just finished reading Mr. Frank Preston 
Stearns's "Midsummer of Italian Art," a very enter- 
taining book, noticed in the last issue of THE DIAL. I 
do not wish to criticize the author's criticisms, though 
some of them are sufficiently remarkable, for exam- 
ple, the criticism of Raphael's " Miraculous Draught of 
Fishes " on the ground that the boat is too close to shore 
to catch respectable fish: a singular limitation upon our 
Lord's miraculous powers. But there are some physical 
facts to which attention may be called. 

On page 50, and again on page 80, Mr. Stearns states 
that the " Head of the Medusa," attributed to Leonardo 
da Vinci, is in the Tribune of the Uffizi. It is now in 
the second room you enter, far from the Tribune, and I 
have never seen it there. Was it ever in the Tribune ? 

On page 85 he says that Michelangelo's " David " was 
removed into the Palazzo Vecchio some twenty years 
ago. The only removal recorded by history was its re- 
moval in 1873 to the Accademia, where it now stands. 

On page 96 he says that one of Michelangelo's " Cap- 
tives " is in the Louvre and the other in the Boboli Gar- 
dens at Florence. Both pieces have been in the Louvre 
whenever I visited it, and as far as I can ascertain both 
have been in France since the reign of Francis I. 

On pages 130 et seq. he says, in speaking of the Tombs 
of the Medici, that the statue called " II Pensieroso " 
is Giuliano and the other Lorenzo. All other writers 
reverse this. Have the bones of these worthies been 
changed, or any new light thrown on the subject ? 

On page 233 he states that Raphael's " Dispute on 
the Sacrament " is on the ceiling of the Stanza, and on 
page 234 he states that the altar in the picture is in the 
centre of the ceiling. When I was there last, a few 
months ago, it was still where Raphael painted it, 
firmly frescoed on the side wall, while the ceiling was 
covered with other frescoes equally famous. Has an 
earthquake turned the venerable edifice upon its side ? 

On page 311 he says that from the windows of the 
Antecollegio in the Doge's Palace, where are Tintor- 
etto's " Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne " and Paul 
Veronese's "Rape of Europa," you have a beautiful 
view of the Adriatic and the Lido. When I was there 
you could see nothing from the windows except the 
court-yard of the Ducal Palace. If the rest of the 
building were thrown down (and I have not heard of 
such a disaster) you might see the Adriatic, but as these 
windows, which are on one side, turn away from the 
Lido I do not understand how that could be seen. 

In his preface the author says that he had years of 
study and experience before beginning to write the 
book; but as I read these things, I wonder whether I 
have been wandering in a dream or the amiable author 
has written his book in the comfortable seclusion of a 
New England village without troubling himself to visit 
the places he writes about so well. (j. B. ROSE.

SOME RECENT JAPANESE LITERATURE. 

( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Three or four brief specimens of recent Japanese 
classic literature may possibly be of interest to the con- 
stituency of THE DIAL. The death of Prince Kitashira- 



132 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



kawa naturally called forth many literary memorials. 
One such production may be translated somewhat as 
follows : " Alas ! the water of ' the White River ' is 
gone forever, for man's life is like a floating bubble, 
which soon disappears. We knew such an end would 
come to men; but we did not expect it for the noble 
Prince so soon." 

Another lament over the death of that beloved Prince 
is attributed to the pen of Mr. Konakamura, " one of 
the best living authorities on Japanese classic litera- 
ture." This has been roughly translated as follows: 
" Pitiable is the life of men. It is like the water of a 
flowing stream, which goes, but never returns. Troubles 
of sickness are common to all. Distinctions of rank 
make no difference here. The sad memories of the 
Prince are too many to be conceived of in our hearts, 
too great to be uttered by our tongues." A Japanese, 
writing in " The Japan Evangelist," while commending 
the style of the original of this, condemns the general 
tenor of its thoughts as " quite unsatisfactory as a 
healthy expression of sentiments awakened by such an 
occasion " ; and he goes on to contrast very forcibly the 
despair and pessimism of these two productions with 
the optimism and inspiring hopefulness of Tennyson's 
" Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington." This 
same contrast serves only to emphasize the sharp differ- 
ence between the influences of Christianity and of Bud- 
dhism upon human thought. The latter teaches that 
eternity is oblivion and life a bubble; the former, that 
life is worth living and is full of hope. 

Not at all pessimistic, however, were the poems writ- 
ten by Their Imperial Majesties of Japan, at the New 
Year's poetical fete, on the subject, " Congratulatory 
Poems in Connection with Mountains." I quote from 
the "Japan Mail": 

" The Emperor's poem ran as follows : 
' Ame no shita 
Nigiwti yo kosu 
Tanoshi kere ; 
Yama no oku made 
Michi no hiraketc.' 
" [Happy the age when 
The country prospers ; for then 
Does truth reach the remoteness 
Of remote mountains.] 

" The Empress composed the following couplet : 
' Amatsu hi no 
Hikari wo ukete 
Kurai Yama; 
Mi no hodo-hodo ni 
Noboru Mi-yo kana.' 
" [The rays of the sun 
Of heaven reach to the dark 
Mountain recesses. 
Auspicious age ! Each in 
His sphere happily prospers.] 

"In His Imperial Majesty's poem there is a play on the 
word michi (road, way, truth), while the play in that of Her 
Majesty's turns on the phrase kurai'yama (mountain of rank 
dark mountain)."

" THE Monroe Doctrine and the War Spirit in the

LITERARY ANECDOTES OF THE 
NINETEENTH CENTURY.* 

The initial volume of Dr. Nicoll's " Literary 
Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century," a 
tempting olla podrida of waifs and fragments, 
literary, epistolary, biographical, and anecdo- 
tal, presents, amid a good deal that is mainly 
curious and out-of-the-way, a fair amount of 
important and instructive matter. The work 
was suggested by Nichols's familiar " Literary 
Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century"; and 
the editors intend to provide in it fresh matter 
illustrative of the life and work of British au- 
thors, including the less-known ones, of the per- 
iod, recourse being had mainly to manuscript 
sources, and to inaccessible texts and fugitive 
writings. It is proposed to supply concise biog- 
raphies, letters hitherto unpublished, additions 
from manuscript sources to unpublished works, 
together with a series of full bibliographies of 
the writings of the greater authors rather 
more than a third of the opening volume fall- 
ing under the heading, " Materials for a Bibli- 
ography of the Writings in Prose and Yerse of 
Robert Browning." Illustrations and numer- 
ous fac similes will be furnished in each vol- 
ume ; and only one thousand copies of each are 
to be printed, two hundred and fifty of them 
for America. The book is handsomely made, 
and contains an especially attractive pictorial 
feature in the form of a fine portrait (frontis- 
piece) of William Blake, after a rare plate 
etched by William Bell Scott from Phillips's 
life-size oil sketch. The initial volume includes : 
" The Trial of William Blake for Sedition " 
being a detailed account of the curious episode 
mentioned in Gilchrist's life of the painter-poet, 
together with transcripts of original documents, 
the speech of Blake's counsel, etc.; " Arthur 
Henry Hallam as Advocate of Alfred and 
Charles Tennyson," comprising two hitherto 
unpublished letters written by Hallam to Leigh 
Hunt, one of them enclosing and commending 
the two volumes published by the Tennysons in 
1830, the other concerning mainly Shelley's 
" Masque of Anarchy "; " An Opinion on Ten- 
nyson," by Mrs. Browning ; " Thomas Wade," 
by Mr. H. Buxton Forman, a critical and bio- 
graphical sketch, followed by some fifty of 
Wade's sonnets, together with his longer poems,

" The Contention of Death and Love," and 
"Helena"; " The Landor-Blessington Papers"; 
" A Brief Account of Richard Henry Home," 
by Mr. H. B. Forman, followed by Home's 
" Ballad of Delora," as originally printed in 
" The Monthly Repository "; " Hawthorne in 
the Shadow of Johnson " mainly a pleasant 
little essay on Uttoxeter originally written by 
Hawthorne for "The Keepsake," and after- 
wards embodied by him in a chapter of " Our 
Old Home "; " A Dramatic Scene," by Charles 
Wells, with a biographical note on the author by 
Mr. H. B. Forman ; " A Bundle of Letters from 
Shelley to Leigh Hunt " an interesting and 
representative series, of which the editor says : 
" Not one of them was written in the year when the 
true Shelley was born, the year 1814; only one was writ- 
ten before that year, namely in 1813, the year of ' Queen 
Mab,' the last and best work of the preliminary or por- 
tentous Shelley; and all the rest are alive with the 
heart's blood and intellectual ferment of that unique 
personality that started suddenly into fulness of life 
when it came into contact with a notable personality of 
the other sex, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin." 

The first of the Hallam letters (1831) was 
written, as already said, to Hunt a propos of 
the two Tennyson volumes (" Poems Chiefly 
Lyrical," by Alfred, and " Sonnets and Fugi- 
tive Pieces," by Charles) of 1830. Hallam 
was then at Cambridge, and Hunt was editing 
" The Tatler." The former wrote : 

" Will you excuse the liberty that a perfect stranger 
to you takes in sending you two little volumes of Poetry, 
with which I cannot but think you will be pleased ? 
They are the compositions of two brothers, both very 
young men, and both intimate friends of mine. The 
larger volume was reviewed in the last number of ' The 
Westminster Review ' (I believe by Dr. Bowring) , and 
the high praise bestowed upon it by the reviewer is not 
higher in my opinion, and I hope in yours, than its mer- 
its demand. I flatter myself you will, if you peruse 
this book, be surprised and delighted to find a new 
prophet of those true principles of Art which, in this 
country, you were among the first to recommend both 
by precept and example. Since the death of John 
Keats, the last lineal descendant of Apollo, our English 
region of Parnassus has been domineered over by kings 
of shreds and patches. But, if I mistake not, the true heir 
is found: ' if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance, 
that which you hear you '11 swear you see, there is such 
unity in the proofs. The mantle and the jewel about 
the neck ! The letters whose character is known ! The 
majesty of the creature in resemblance of its father, the 
affection of nobleness, and many other evidences pro- 
claim him, with all certainty, to be the king's son. . . .' 
I do not suppose that either of these poets is likely to 
become immediately or extensively popular : they write 
not to the world at large, which ' lieth in wickedness ' 
and bad taste, but to the elect Church of Urania, which 
we know to be small and in tribulation. Now in this 
church you have preferment, and what you preach will 
be considered by the faithful as a sound form of 
words. . . ." 



The second Hallam letter (1832), thanking 
Hunt for a copy of the " Masque of Anarchy," 
contains an allusion to an episode of Cambridge 
life familiar to lovers of Shelley, and known as 
the Revival of 1829 : 

" While at Cambridge I partook largely in the en- 
thusiasm which animated many of my contemporaries, 
and indeed formed us into a sort of sect in behalf of his 
character and genius. If I have since somewhat tem- 
pered that enthusiasm in so far as it extended to some 
of his peculiar opinions, I have not ceased, and shall not, 
to regard him as one of the most remarkable men and 
greatest poets whom this country has produced. . . ." 

Of the " Landor-Blessington Papers " (let- 
ters, and pieces in verse and prose lavished by 
the poet on his fair correspondent for use in 
her Annuals) the chief constituent is a literal 
transcript from a bundle of papers in Landor's 
autograph. On some of these documents biog- 
raphers have already drawn, and much of the 
verse has been collected into Landor's Poetical 
Works. It may be noted here, touching Lan- 
dor's " Citation and Examination of William 
Shakespeare," the manuscript of which he sent 
to Lady Blessington, in care of N. P. Willis, 
that while her ladyship derived yearly from her 
" Keepsakes " and " Books of Beauty " an in- 
come of .1000 to 2500, she was unable to 
get the " Citation " printed except at the au- 
thor's cost. Some of the letters to Lady Bless- 
ington are rather in the " Boy thorn " vein, 
notably one giving vent to some explosive views 
on social progress a theme, be it said, which 
the writer was singularly unfit to handle : 

"... He (Dr. Verity) tells us, what I cannot think, 
that civilization has always been progressive. If it has, 
it has for ages and ages been in the gout and on crutches. 
The wild North- American hears in dignified silence the 
scoffs of those vile barbarians who deal in slaves. He 
never interrupts the person who is speaking, and re- 
serves all violent gestures for the tomahawk, after a 
solemn declaration of war. Yet a member of the Brit- 
ish or even of the French parliament would have the 
impudence to tell me that his assembly gives evidence 
of higher civilization. The very opposites to the North- 
Americans are the Chinese. In internal policy they far 
excel the Europeans; and altho highly commercial, the 
government consents to lose incalculable revenues rather 
than admit a drug which demoralizes the people. Which 
affords the higher proof of civilization the casting of 
opium into the canals of China or the erection of gin- 
shops in the streets of London ? In fact, no nation is, 
or ever was, half civilized. How the Arts flourished 
in the reign of Elizabeth, and the Sciences in George 
IV.'s ! Yet what odious monsters ! without one vir- 
tue. Henry VIII. was warm in friendship Mary, both 
in love and religion. Nearer our own times, look at 
Swift and Rousseau Moralists ! Philosophers ! Two 
such scoundrels are nowhere to be found outside of roy- 
alty. Henry VIII. and Nero would never have acted 
as Rousseau did, when he permitted the poor girl his 
fellow-servant to be punished for his theft and tho

they might burn seditious sectaries, would never have 
lighted up those sad slow fires which consumed Vanessa 
and Stella. Where and what is our civilization ? . . ." 

And so the testy old lion goes on growling at 
gods and men little reflecting that, but for 
the social progress, with its attendant increased 
freedom of speech and opinion, which he de- 
nied and to which the " scoundrel " Rousseau 
materially contributed, he, Walter Landor, Es- 
quire, one time of Tachebrooke, must infallibly 
have been laid by the heels (to name a very 
moderate penalty) for a tithe of his habitual 
railings at the existing order. Noisy social and 
political malcontents who rail unpunished should 
have the grace to admit that the modern State 
has at least one cardinal virtue tolerance. 
Among the Landor - Bless in gton papers is a 
half-sheet, unaddressed, containing two pun- 
gent stanzas referring to Wordsworth little 
tokens of good feeling toward a brother-poet. 
The first one needs no comment ; the second is 
plainly levelled at Wordsworth's amazing lines, 

"... Almighty God ! 
But thy most dreaded instrument 
In working out a pure intent 
Is man arrayed for mutual slaughter ? 
Yea ; Carnage is thy daughter " 

(to which Shelley also paid his respects in 
" Peter Bell the Third ") in the Thanksgiv- 
ing Ode on the Battle of Waterloo." We sub- 
join the stanzas : 

" Tho Southey's poetry to you should seem 
Not worth five shillings (as you say) per ream, 
Courage ! good wary Wordsworth ! and disburse 
The whole amount from that reluctant purse. 
Here, take my word, 'tis neither shame nor sin 
To hazard . . . throwing all your own stuff in. 

" No more on daisies and on pilewort fed 
By tiresome Duddon's ever troubled bed, 
Lo ! Qrasmere's cuckoo leaves these tranquil scenes 
For cities, shovel hats, and dandy deans, 
And, prickt with spicy cheer and portly nod, 
Devoutly fathers Slaughter upon God." 

Passing to the Shelley letters (to Leigh 
Hunt), we may cite first an eloquent passage 
in one dated at Marlow, 1816, wherein the 
writer dwells painfully on the fatal discrepancy 
between his high humanitarian aims and ideals, 
and his position before the world resulting from 
the view the world not unreasonably chose to 
take of his conduct and opinions. 

"... Next, will I own the Hymn to Intellectual 
Beauty ' ? I do not care as you like.* And yet the 
poem was composed under the influence of feelings 
which agitated me even to tears, so that I think it de- 
serves a better fate than the being linked with so stig- 

*The question (of signature) here alluded to was settled 
thus : the poem appeared in " The Examiner," Jan. 19, 1817 ; 
and, though Hunt had previously announced it to come out 
over the signature " Elfin Knight," it did finally appear over 
that of Shelley. 



matized and unpopular a name as mine. You will say 
that it is not thus, that I am morbidly sensitive to what 
I esteem the injustice of neglect but I do not say that I 
am unjustly neglected, the oblivion which overtook my 
little attempt of ' Alastor ' I am ready to acknowledge 
was sufficiently merited in itself; but then it was not 
accorded in the correct proportion considering the suc- 
cess of the most contemptible drivellings. I am unde- 
ceived in the belief that I have powers deeply to inter- 
est, or substantially to improve, mankind. How far my 
conduct and my opinions have rendered the zeal and 
ardor with which I have engaged in the attempt inef- 
fectual, I know not. Self-love prompts me to assign 
much weight to a cause which perhaps has none. But 
thus much I do not seek to conceal from myself, that I 
am an outcast from human society; my name is exe- 
crated by all those who understand its full import, by 
those very beings whose happiness I ardently desire. I 
am an object of compassion to a few more benevolent 
than the rest, all else abhor and avoid me. With you, 
and perhaps some others (though in a less degree I fear) 
my gentleness and sincerity find favor, because they are 
themselves gentle and sincere; they believe in self- 
devotion and generosity because they are themselves 
self-devoted and generous. Perhaps I should have shrunk 
from persisting in the task which I had undertaken in 
early life, of opposing myself in these evil times and 
among these evil tongues, to what I esteem misery and 
vice; if I must have lived in the solitude of the heart. 
Fortunately my domestic circle incloses that within it 
which compensates for the loss. . . ." 

In a letter from Naples, dated Dec. 22, 1818, 
Shelley draws a comparison between the social 
and human Italy, and what may be termed the 
Byronic or the Goethean Italy, in which the 
chiaroscuro is amusingly strained : 

"... There are two Italics one composed of the 
green earth and transparent sea, and the mighty ruins 
of ancient time, and aerial mountains, and the warm 
and radiant atmosphere which is interfused through all 
things; the other consists of the Italians of the present 
day, their works and ways. The one is the most sub- 
lime and lovely contemplation that can be conceived by 
the imagination of man; the other is the most degraded, 
disgusting, and odious. What do you think ? Young 
women of rank actually eat you will never guess what 
garlick ! Our poor friend Lord Byron is quite cor- 
rupted by living among these people; and, in fact, is 
going on in a way not very worthy of him." 

That his lordship added garlic-eating to his 
other Italian ate iniquities does not appear ; 
but we find Shelley declaring in a later letter 
that " particular dispositions in Lord Byron's 
character render the close and exclusive inti- 
macy with him in which I find myself intoler- 
able to me." Shelley's insensibility to music (a 
strange flaw in one of the most melodious of 
poets) is well known ; and one gathers from the 
following passage that he had, like Tennyson, 
an imperfect appreciation of pictorial art : 

". . . With respect to Michael Angelo I dissent, and 
think with astonishment and indignation of the common 
notion that he equals, and in some respects exceeds, 
Raffaele. He seems to me to have no sense of moral

dignity and loveliness; and the energy for which he 
has been so much praised, appears to me to be a cer- 
tain rude, external, mechanical quality, in comparison 
with anything possessed by Raffaele, or even much in- 
ferior artists. His famous painting in the Sixtine Chapel 
seems to me deficient in beauty and majesty, both in 
the conception and the execution. It might have con- 
tained all the forms of terror and delight and it is a 
dull and wicked emblem of a dull and wicked thing. 
Jesus Christ is like an angry pot-boy, and God like an 
old ale-house keeper looking out of window. He has 
been called the Dante of painting; but if we find some 
of the gross and strong outlines which are employed in 
the most distasteful passages of the Inferno, where shall 
we find your Francesca where the spirit coming over 
the sea in a boat, like Mars rising from the vapors of 
the horizon where Matilda gathering flowers, and all 
the exquisite tenderness, and sensibility, and ideal 
beauty, in which Dante excelled all poets except Shake- 
speare ? " 

The Herculean forms that still loom in their 
craggy grandeur from the smoke-dimmed vault 
of the Sixtine Chapel certainly have little in 
common with the exquisite, aBriform shapes 
which peopled the reveries and haunt the verse 
of Shelley ; and one may reasonably find them 
lacking in grace, and even in beauty. But to 
pronounce the works of Michael Angelo defi- 
cient in majesty of conception and execution 
seems a judgment too hollow to be imputed to 
imperfect sympathy alone. 

A poet of a temper widely different from that 
of Mr. Arnold's " beautiful and ineffectual an- 
gel " was erratic Richard Henry (or Hengist) 
Home, best known, we need scarcely say, as 
the author of " Orion, an Epic Poem." Home 
was a man of varied talents, and, while it can 
scarcely be said of him, as Lamb said of Dek- 
ker, that " he had poetry enough for anything," 
he wrote some good verse that has been unduly 
slighted by the anthologists. We may perhaps 
agree with our editors who predict that " sooner 
or later he, who enjoyed much well-merited 
fame of many sorts in his day, will have ' one 
day more.' ' : In the present volume Home's 
" Ballad of Delora, or the Passion of Andrea 
Como," a romantic production greatly praised 
by Browning, is printed entire. " Delora " 
seems to us a singular mingling of fire and fus- 
tian, elevation and bathos gold and dross in 
pretty even proportions. But there is a fine 
ballad ring, a strain of wild harmony and wilder 
passions, in the quaint stanzas ; and we are glad 
to see them rescued from obscurity. 

Dr. Nicoll's work will probably comprise six 
volumes ; but these will be separately indexed, 
and each may be regarded as complete in itself. 
The slender quota set apart for America should 
be promptly exhausted. Et G> j 4 



THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT OF 
AFRICA.* 



The most important movement of the last 
half of our century, the most far-reaching in 
its influence upon the future of the world, is 
undoubtedly the opening of Africa to civiliza- 
tion under the auspices of the powers of West- 
ern Europe. Even such unlovely sentiments 
as French chauvinism and English jingoism, 
and their German equivalent, are working out 
for the world beneficent results that may per- 
haps induce us to view their existence with tol- 
eration if not with satisfaction. What are the 
questions about which the Great Powers con- 
tinue to excite themselves the balance of 
power between the nations of Europe, the pos- 
session of small provinces, tariffs, and commer- 
cial rivalries but petty and insignificant as 
compared with the work of opening and pre- 
paring for civilization the vast regions of the 
Dark Continent ? Twenty years ago there were 
but two white men in Central Africa ; to-day 
it is apportioned among the nations of Europe, 
each in its " sphere of influence " opening up 
routes of commerce, pushing forward railroads, 
putting steamers upon the lakes and rivers, 
stamping out the slave-trade, teaching the sav- 
ages the elements of civilization and order. 
South Africa has seen the same swift progress, 
mainly under the spur of British hunger for 
land and gold. No part of the continent, ex- 
cept Morocco and a portion of Sahara, is left 
without its European owner or protector. 

Such changes, so great and widespread, fur- 
nish material for a most interesting volume, 
and Mrs. Latimer has made good use of her 
opportunity in her work on " Europe in Africa 
in the Nineteenth Century." Her book was 
needed, for there is nowhere a full and clear 
account of this movement as a whole. She has 
interpreted her title generously, and given a 
sketch of the modern history of those countries 
that have a past, as well as America's little 
contribution to Africa in the state of Liberia. 
This is not the book of a political philosopher 
nor of a scientific historian, but of a bright wo- 
man of wide experience and knowledge of the 
world, who has told what interested herself, in 
the hope that it would be interesting to other 
people. It has the interest of remarkable per- 
sonalities, in the work of Livingstone, Stanley, 
Gordon, Cecil Rhodes, Mehemet AH, and Ab-

del Kader ; the interest of variety in life and 
character, from the savage to the saint and the 
high-spirited university man ; and the interest 
we have already spoken of, that of a great de- 
velopment in the history of man. It would be 
ungracious to note flaws and deficiencies in the 
author's work after the modest disclaimer of 
her preface ; and the task she set herself is so 
difficult that we can only be grateful for the 
useful book she has given us. Its usefulness 
and attractiveness are greatly enhanced by the 
three maps and twenty-three full-page portraits 
which the publishers have provided. 

Mr. Ashe's book on Uganda is an excellent 
complement to Mrs. Latimer's general work. 
It is of about the same size, yet treats only of 
one little spot under the equator, giving in full 
detail those events and processes at which the 
general account can only hint. Uganda fur- 
nishes a typical example of the work of mis- 
sionaries, traders, explorers, and chartered 
companies, among a purely savage people. 
Three faiths have contended for supremacy in 
Uganda Mohammedan, Roman Catholic, and 
Protestant ; and the strife of Arabs, French, 
and English has been keen, if not wholly ex- 
emplary. Heroic service has been performed 
by Mackay, Hannington, and their associates, 
of whom Mr. Ashe was one ; and much noble 
Christian character has been developed, faith- 
ful even unto death. Yet the story is almost 
throughout one of intrigue, cruelty, and war, 
the weak king and a great number of his fol- 
lowers becoming Protestant, Catholic, or Mo- 
hammedan, according as their greed or their 
passions were most liberally encouraged. 

The study of such a narrative makes one 
very doubtful whether this people, or any Cen- 
tral African peoples, can ever reach a high de- 
gree of civilization, or whether any immigrants 
to that region who can endure the climate of 
the torrid zone can maintain such civilization. 
The elements of civilization can supplant sav- 
agery ; slavery and the slave-trade can be abol- 
ished ; certain kinds of production can be de- 
veloped there ; but any large part of the world's 
work can hardly be done in Africa, except in 
those regions north of the desert and south of 
the Zambezi. 

An instructive feature of this book is the 
light that it throws upon the methods of the 
chartered companies to which some of the pow- 
ers have committed the development and con- 
trol of their portions of the Dark Continent. 
The irresponsible position of these companies, 
with the necessity upon their officers of making 



dividends or displeasing the directors, has led 
even well-disposed agents into courses of action 
that have greatly hindered the prime work of 
introducing civilization. It may have been nec- 
essary under existing conditions, but it was 
none the less unfortunate. Recent events have 
shown the same results in South Africa. And 
one cannot but feel the absurdity of making 
treaties, and applying the civilized theories of 
international relations to blood-thirsty savages, 
as was done in Uganda, and of making great 
interests depend upon such treaties.

DANTE IN SPENSERIAN VERSE.* 



Dante is so great in the untranslatable qual- 
ities of style in musical successions of sylla- 
bles, in phrases which suggest the true thoughts 
by their sound that every new version of the 
Divine Comedy needs an apology. It requires 
but a few weeks of easy work to learn enough 
Italian to read in the original this most stu- 
pendous art-work of the human spirit. Helps 
of all kinds abound, so that one may begin 
with no very heavy equipment of grammatical 
acquirement, and yet be able to appreciate the 
fine appropriateness in diction, the delicate and 
noble constructions, and, above all, the singing 
qualities of the poem. The scholar, and the 
lover of poetry who possesses leisure, will have 
none of your translations, being well aware that 
the exquisite essences of a poem can only by 
the greatest skill and the most remarkable good- 
luck be transferred from one language to an- 
other. A literal prose rendering they may 
indeed find useful as a help to understanding 
difficult passages. But for readers ignorant of 
Italian who wish to feel somewhat of Dante's 
beauty and power, a literal prose translation is 
disenchanting and wholly unsatisfactory. The 
only thing to be done for them is to make an- 
other poem, reproducing the general effect of 
Dante's as far as may be, and containing his 
thoughts as much as possible, but especially 
giving an impression of his symphonic move- 
ment, his volume of harmonious sound. Long- 
fellow's versified and yet exceedingly literal 
rendering does not belong to either of these 
two classes, and it is difficult to see to whom it 
can be useful now. No metrical translation can 
be sufficiently literal, after all, to help the

scholar who knows Italian. Yet to follow the 
original closely, Longfellow has often sacrificed 
grace and clearness, so that one has to refer to 
Dante to translate the translation. Mr. Nor- 
ton's prose version should supplant all met- 
rical ones in the use of scholars. And for a 
popular book, to be in the hands of persons 
who cannot hope ever to taste the incommuni- 
cable poetical essences which are and must be 
lost in translation, Mr. Musgrave has the right 
idea. His intention is to represent Dante as 
much in the music of words and lines as in his 
thoughts. This is a translation for people who 
want to be pleased fully as much as they want 
to be instructed, and who will not receive in- 
struction unless it is pleasingly conveyed. 

For a poem which is not only epical but lyr- 
ical, the Spenserian stanza is a remarkably 
suitable form. It contains possibilities of har- 
mony within itself, second only to those in the 
sonnet. The oft-recurring and intricately in- 
terwoven rhymes enable it to ring with the en- 
during complexity of a musical chord ; while 
the length of the lines, and the additional syl- 
lables of the ninth, impart dignity and per- 
mit of a full slow cadence. It is less evident 
that this stanza is a good form for long narra- 
tives. For its adaptability to this purpose we 
have the testimony of Spenser's own successful 
employment of it, not to mention Byron's. But 
we might as well admit that while it very well 
renders the lyrical music of Dante, it does not so 
happily reproduce the deep continuous orches- 
tration of his epical movement. The only form 
of verse which combines both properties is the 
terza rima which Dante himself used. It is 
astonishing that English poets should venture 
still to try to render him in any other form. 
But the terza rima Mr. Musgrave has " dis- 
carded as too alien to the genius of the English 
tongue." Having seen fit to do this, he has 
made some amends by adopting the next best 
the one in which the combination of rhymes 
most nearly approaches terza rima. Linked 
and repeated rhymes are essential to any rep- 
resentation of the sound-effects of Dante. A 
translator in verse cannot afford to throw away 
any means of musical charm, especially when 
the original is Italian, for by no possibility, 
using both rhyme and rhythm to the utmost, 
can he hope to equal the harmony of Italian 
poetry. Moreover, in rendering into verse, a 
process wherein personal inspiration must often 
be intermitted, there is needed all the artificial 
help available, and the constant stimulus of 
seeking rhymes is one of the two golden spurs 



with which the rider of the phantom Pegasus 
at the service of translators urges forward his 
unwilling steed. And to consider specially the 
requirements for translating Dante, it must be 
borne in mind that there are certain effects of 
grotesqueness, and a wide range both of harsh 
and gentle notes, which the rhyme, because of 
its concreteness, is better able to express than 
metre, which bears the same relation to rhyme 
that Time does to Space. 

Blank verse is out of the question. When 
made by an excellent poet in his hours of 
strength, there is no mightier music than En- 
glish blank verse. But the labor of a trans- 
lator can in few cases be limited to these rare 
intervals. It must go on through weak moods 
and strong. Rhyme will cheer up the tired 
spirits and put marching humor into weary feet. 
That which in a work of creation might be a 
vexatious cause of delay is indispensable in a 
work of artifice. 

Critics who forget the wants of common, 
busy people, may deal severely with Mr. Mus- 
grave for his occasional expansions or contrac- 
tions of Dante's ideas. But the strong point 
of this translation is one which makes it fit for 
readers on whom minute accuracy would be 
wasted ; it is a vigorous, musical rendering, 
in the spirit of mediaeval art. The rhymes 
are abundant and melodious ; the best of Mr. 
Musgrave's effects are produced with triplets 
of feminine rhymes interlinked with the char- 
acteristic English masculine rhymes. The 
metre is sometimes bad. The English language 
has reached too great fixity for a poet to per- 
mit himself such licenses of ellipsis as Mr. Mus- 
grave occasionally employs. There are also 
infelicitous and even incorrect translations. 
But this was inevitable. 

GEORGE M'LEAN HARPER. 



MR. L. A. WADDELL'S work on " Lamaism " (Allen, 
London) is one to make scholars of Northern Buddhism 

the so-called Mahayana school nothing less than 

thankful. To extensive personal acquaintance with the 
people and literature of Thibet, the land of Lamaism, 
the author adds thorough acquaintance with the Euro- 
pean authorities on the subject, and has thereby pro- 
duced a comprehensive treatise not a compilation 
which simply supersedes all previous ones. Noticeable 
also is the rare and invaluable combination of literature 
and archseology in elucidation of the theme. The nu- 
merous and very beautiful illustrations are most appro- 
priate in treating a religion so dominated by ceremo- 
nial. Nothing better need be expected for decades, or 
until foreigners enjoy the freedom of travel and re- 
search in Thibet hitherto denied them.

SEVEN BOOKS OF TRAVEL.* 

Mr. Thomas Hughes, the well known and 
well beloved author of " Tom Brown's School- 
days," gives us in "Vacation Kambles " a series 
of letters of travel descriptive of his European 
and American trips during the last thirty years. 
Most of these letters are reprinted from " The 
Spectator," the remainder being letters to his 
wife from America ; and all are edited for this 
volume by his son. Mr. Hughes flits so rap- 
idly from place to place that little consecutive 
interest is possible ; but when, as at Dieppe, he 
makes some connected description, it is very 
agreeably done. American readers will be 
most interested in the letters written during his 
various excursions to " the States." He finds 
us " the most silent and reserved of any race " 
he has visited. " Emerson is perfectly delight- 
ful : so simple, wise, and full of humor and sun- 
shine." Of Lowell he says : " He has not a 
grain of vanity in his composition, but is as 
simple and truthful as the best kind of boy. 
... I found him much better than his books." 
The second series of Mr. Hughes's American 
letters gives some account of the Rugby colony 
in Tennessee. The chief charm of this book 
is an intimate revelation of a thoroughly hon- 
est, large-souled, genial Englishman, of the best 
type. The style is the man, brisk, bright, 
sturdy, and of a healthy and hearty humor. 
There is no sting in this book, and none of that 
self-conscious intellectual brilliancy and liter- 
ary smartness that mar even the letters of James 
Russell Lowell and Matthew Arnold. This 
volume could be improved by adding a portrait 
of the author and an index. But on the whole

it is a most readable and companionable book, 
and we hope it is only the first installment of 
the letters of Thomas Hughes. 

In the next book on our list, Mr. A. C. Bick- 
nell gives an account of his travels in North- 
ern Queensland. Mr. Bicknell has knocked 
around the world a good deal, with varied ex- 
periences ; but not having the gift of style 
as he himself acknowledges nor yet that of 
close and trained observation or careful reflec- 
tion, he produces a book of only mediocre qual- 
ity. His style may be excusably uncultivated, 
but it has no right to be slangy, which it often 
is. If such Australian terms as " sundowner," 
" swagmen," " squatter chairs," etc., must be 
used, they should be explained. Nor can we 
pardon such carelessness as this, in speaking of 
a kind of geese as " rare, and found only in 
Northern Queensland. Enormous numbers 
may sometimes be seen in a single flock." In 
this book we get some light on prospecting, 
mining, and on various phases of Australian 
frontier life, which much resembles the life in 
our Far West. Much extraneous matter creeps 
into this book, as the stories of Nicaragua life, 
Ecuador experience, and other tales, sufficiently 
interesting perhaps, but out of place. The vol- 
ume has neither map nor index. It is illus- 
trated with wood-cuts of slight pretentious. 

In " An Artist in the Himalayas," Mr. A. 
D. McCormick, who was a companion of Sir 
Martin Conway in his famous tour in the Kash- 
mir region, gives by pen and pencil his impres- 
sions of the trip. The book is not in any 
sense a general account of the expedition, but 
is merely a personal narrative, and that of a 
rather slight order. Notwithstanding the au- 
thor's modest disclaimer that his book " has no 
pretensions to be literature, an art by no means 
within my province," he yet writes in a very 
agreeable and bright fashion. The real artist 
in one kind of art is rarely a sloven in another 
kind. Mr. McCormick describes no very start- 
ling adventures, but he gives us interesting im- 
pressions of the beauty and grandeur of the 
great Himalayas. One of the grandest land- 
scapes he saw " was composed of valleys with 
glittering ice walls, their sides ribbed with av- 
alanche tracks, and away in the hot, hazy dis- 
tance, peak after peak topped and overtopped 
each other in bright tones of pure pearl." 
Again, he says : 

" At the entrance to the Astor Valley I learned what 
the grandeur of the mountains really meant. We were 
in the bottom of a narrow valley, in which great grey 
rock cliffs rose high up on either hand, and disappeared 
in the mist at the end of the gorge, across which the

clouds trailed, when someone shouted " look up, Mac," 
and away in the heavens above I saw three great ice 
peaks, like towers of polished silver, which the passing 
cloud shadows dimmed and brightened as when one 
breathes on bright metal. The colors that played in the 
depths of this blaze of light can never be imagined nor 
described. I gazed spellbound. I never saw anything 
which had such an effect on me in all our journey as 
this. I had eyes for no other scenery that day, for I 
had seen heaven, and the great white throne." 

The pencil sketches which illustrate the volume 
are slight enough, but they have some quality. 
The work is pleasantly written and will serve 
as an agreeable companion for an idle hour. 

In " Persian Life and Customs," Mr. S. G. 
Wilson, a Presbyterian missionary in Persia, 
gives a popular and summary sketch of the coun- 
try, with some account of his travels therein. 
However, as the author's way was chiefly along 
well-known routes, and as he does not appear 
to have had any exceptional sources of infor- 
mation, his book contains little that is new. 
During one of his journeys Mr. Wilson sees 
multitudes of lizards, and this is the rather 
strange account he gives : " Lizards, both nu- 
merous and active, continually dart before the 
eye. There are literally millions of them. 
They are divided into believers and infidels. 
The latter it is lawful to kill." Mr. Wilson 
found in his travels that a few Persian inns 
were paying some special attention to the wants 
of Europeans. A Kasvin hotel " even excelled 
in providing not only combs, but also tooth- 
brushes and night-caps for the public use ! " 
Further, the author elsewhere says : " The min- 
ing of coal at Teheran, the use of Russian 
petroleum throughout the country, and gas and 
electric light in the public squares of the cap- 
ital, are all signs of progress." Yet, on the 
whole, he concludes that " the present outlook 
is not favorable to a speedy reception of nine- 
teenth century ideas in the way of commercial 
exploitation, or to any marked change in the 
religious beliefs of the people." Perhaps the 
best chapter in the book is that on the little- 
known sect of the Ali-Allahis. This book is 
rather dry in style, largely because the sen- 
tences are cut too short and the statements are 
too bald. It has a fair map, and some photo- 
graphic illustrations of interest. 

Another Presbyterian missionary, Mr. G. L. 
MacKay, gives us in " From Far Formosa " an 
account of his extended stay in that island, and 
adds some notes on natural history and anthro- 
pology. This book is concerned almost entirely 
with North Formosa, which is a very distinct 
division. Formosa is a tropical island off the 



China coast about twice the size of New Jersey, 
and contains nearly 2,000,000 inhabitants. As 
a result of the late Chino-Japanese war, it has 
been annexed to Japan. Mr. MacKay explored 
North Formosa quite thoroughly, and was very 
successful in interesting the natives in Chris- 
tianity. His drawing card was teeth-extracting. 
At one place his record is : " Before dark I 
extracted five hundred and thirteen teeth and 
addressed an immense throng." Very vigor- 
ously, plainly, and piously, he narrates the 
story of his pioneer missionary experiences. 
As a specimen of his style, we quote a bit of 
prophetic prose from the chapter on Bang-kah : 

" The citizens of Bang-kah, old and young, are daily 
toiling for money, money-cash, cash. They are mate- 
rialistic, superstitious dollar-seekers. At every visit, 
when passing through their streets, we are maligned, 
jeered at, and abused. Hundreds of children run ahead, 
yelling with derisive shouts; others follow, pelting us 
with orange peel, mud, and rotten eggs. For hatred to 
foreigners, for pride, swaggering ignorance, and con- 
ceit, for sensual, haughty, double-faced wickedness, 
Bang-kah takes the palm. But remember, O haughty 
city, even these eyes will yet see thee humble in the 
dust. Thou art mighty now, proud and full of malice ; 
but thy power shall fall, and thou shalt be brought low. 
Thy filthy streets are indicative of thy moral rottenness ; 
thy low houses show thy baseness in the face of heaven. 
Repent, O Bang-kah, thou wicked city, or the trump 
shall blow and thy tears be in vain ! " 

We may add that Bang-kah did " repent," and 
the missionary scored a great triumph. Mr. 
MacKay is a true nineteenth century prophet 
and apostle. On the whole, this book is a very 
striking and interesting record. It is provided 
with good maps and illustrations. 

In " Rumbles in Japan," Canon Tristram, a 
practised traveller and writer, gives us his im- 
pressions of a short sojourn in that beautiful 
land. The prime object of his " rambles " was 
to investigate missionary work, but he also paid 
much attention to field botany and zoology and 
to nature in general. We had not thought it 
possible that a fresh book on Japan could be 
written, but this may fairly be called so, as it 
shows much original and close observation. 
Canon Tristram's style, while not very viva- 
cious, is by no means dull. Mr. Whymper's 
illustrations are well done and interesting. 

Both the secondary title and the preface of 
his work convey the idea that Slatin Pasha's 
book, "Fire and Sword in the Sudan," is 
merely a personal narrative, whereas we find 
that fully one-half of the material is general 
history. But the commingling of these two 
subjects is apt to confuse and tire the reader, 
and as the volume is rather unwieldy, the best 



140

[March 1, 



disposition of the material would have been, 
one volume to narration of his own experiences, 
and a second volume to the general history of 
Mahdism. This at least is the division we shall 
make in this review. Slatin was a young lieu- 
tenant in the Austrian army, when in 1879, by 
invitation of General Gordon, he went to the 
Sudan. Here he was soon appointed Gov- 
ernor of the province of Darfur. At the open- 
ing of the Mahdist revolt he held Dara for 
some time against the insurgents, but after the 
destruction of the Hicks Pasha expedition he 
was obliged to surrender. As Slatin had al- 
ready made a profession of Mohammedanism, 
and appeared obedient, he was for some time 
well treated by the Mahdi and by Khalifa Ab- 
dullahi, in whose service he was. But at length, 
suspicion having fallen upon him on account 
of a letter he had written to Gordon, he was 
put in chains and rigorously guarded. In this 
condition, and filled with hopes and fears, he lay 
in his ragged tent during the siege of Khartum 
by the Mahdists. The night of the twenty- 
fifth of January, 1885, he describes as the 
" most excitingly anxious one in my life." 

" If only the attack were repulsed, Khartum would 
be saved; otherwise, all would be lost. Utterly ex- 
hausted, I was just dropping off to sleep at early dawn, 
when I was startled by the deafening discharge of thou- 
sands of rifles and guns; this lasted for a few minutes, 
then only occasional rifle-shots were heard, and all was 
quiet again. . . . Soon shouts of rejoicing and victory 
were heard in the distance; and my guards ran off to 
find out the news. In a few minutes they were back 
again, excitedly relating how Khartum had been taken 
by storm, and was now in the hands of the Mahdists. 
Was it possible the news was false ? I crawled out of 
my tent, and scanned the camp; a great crowd had col- 
lected before the quarters of the Mahdi and Khalifa, 
which were not far off; then there was a movement in 
the direction of my tent; and I could see plainly they 
were coming towards me. In front marched the three 
black soldiers ; one named Shatta, who formerly belonged 
to Ahmed Bey Dafalla's slave body-guard, carried in 
his hands a bloody cloth in which something was wrapped 
up, and behind him followed a crowd of people weep- 
ing. The slaves had now approached my tent, and 
stood before me with insulting gestures; Shatta undid 
the cloth and showed me the head of General Gordon. 
The blood rushed to my head and my heart seemed to 
stop beating; but, with a tremendous effort of self- 
control, I gazed silently at the ghastly spectacle. His 
blue eyes were half-opened, the mouth was perfectly 
natural ; the hair of his head, and his short whiskers, 
were almost quite white." 

Soon after the fall of Khartum, Slatin was re- 
leased from imprisonment and became one of 
the body-guard of Khalifa Abdullahi, who was 
one of the three Khalifas or vicegerents of the 
Mahdi. It was Slatin's duty to be constantly 
on guard at Abdullahi's door, and when he 



went out, to follow barefoot. However, he was 
allowed some huts for himself and servants, 
and on several occasions, to his great distress, 
was presented with wives by his lord and mas- 
ter. Slatin was in this slavery for more than 
ten years before he escaped in February, 1895. 
On his return to Egypt, the Khedive bestowed 
on him the title of Pasha. Next to Slatin 
the most prominent figures in this book are the 
Mahdi and Khalifa Abdullahi. We have much 
new information concerning the Mahdi, which 
corrects such reports as we find in common ref- 
erence books like Chambers's Cyclopaedia. A 
glossary of African and Arabic terms would 
be a useful addition to this book, and the index 
might be much improved. The author's style 
is simple and direct, and in general correct, 
though it sometimes shows signs of haste. " Re- 
covered his defeat " ("p. 84) is an instance. 
This is so good a book that we only regret it 
was not bettered by a clear literary plan car- 
ried out deliberately and artistically. But as 
it is, we have a very interesting narrative of 
remarkable and thrilling adventures, and a 
most important contribution to the history of 
the Sudan and to the history of African Mo- 
hammedanism. HlRAM M . STANLEY. 



RECENT BOOKS ox AMERICAN HISTORY.* 



The scope of American history-writing is con- 
stantly widening. There seems no limit to the pos- 
sibilities for earnest workers in the rich fields, to 
be found in the West as well as in the East. One 
may investigate the work of the Pilgrim Fathers in 
New England, another the toilsome privations of 
the heroic Roman Catholic pioneers among the Iro- 
quois, and a third the sufferings of the Protestant 
missionary in distant Oregon, and each may con- 
tribute much to the story of American achievement 
and American development. Mr. Grinnell's " The 
Story of the Indian " is about another kind of pio- 
neer. It is the first volume in a " Story of the

West " series, which is to be concerned with strictly 
Western types, such as the Indian, the cowboy, the 
miner, the soldier, the trapper, and others who have 
played a prominent part in the history of the trans- 
Mississippi country. Mr. Grinnell, who is an adopted 
chief of the Pawnees and also of the Blackfeet, and 
who has published hero-stories and folk-tales of his 
favorite tribes, tells his story in an attractive man- 
ner. The daily life of the wigwam, the sports, the 
avocations, the food, the prejudices, and the passions 
of the Indian, are well brought out, not the least in- 
teresting being the description of the course of love- 
making and marriage. Perhaps the most striking 
chapter is that devoted to an account of the com- 
ing of the white man into the Indian-life, a chapter 
especially suggestive in connection with the general 
title of the series, of which this is the initial volume. 
The book is full of interesting stories, and must 
prove a popular one with young or old who desire 
to appreciate the part played by the Indians in the 
history of the West. A supplementary chapter on 
the North American Indians is furnished by a mem- 
ber of the Bureau of Ethnology, and adds much to 
the value of the work, because of the information 
regarding the red men in all stages of our history. 

Every American has some notion of the import- 
ant labors performed by the Roman Catholic mis- 
sionaries among the Indians east of the Mississippi. 
Francis Parkman has told the story in words of 
great power, which make deep impress upon the 
mind of the reader who follows him in his descrip- 
tion of the development of New France. His " Jes- 
uits in North America " covers the ground quite 
thoroughly, and yet the subject is so interesting that 
it must have appealed strongly to Mr. Donohoe, as 
he delved into the antiquated tomes which contain 
the " Relations de la Nouvelle France," in search 
of material for his " The Iroquois and the Jesuits." 
But his book contains little not to be found in Mr. 
Parkman's works, although there can be nothing 
but good results from the publication, in simple lan- 
guage and with devout spirit, of the tales of the 
pioneers of the Church among the Iroquois. 

Recent movements for the establishment of some 
form of memorial for Marcus Whitman have greatly 
increased the interest in the story of his relation to 
the settlement of the Northwest boundary. Dr. 
Barrows, in his " Oregon " (" American Common- 
wealths " series), gave by far the best account of the 
matter, and later writers have but repeated his story 
in other words. Despite the efforts of those who 
would eliminate from history everything that seems 
to indicate providential leading, the work done by 
Whitman has become recognized as important in 
its day, and as far-reaching in its influence. The 
little book by Dr. Craighead is well worth having, 
since it gives a succinct account of the early history 
of the Northwest Coast, and puts in convenient com- 
pass and in clear language much that, otherwise, 
can not be ascertained, except by examination of 
numerous volumes. There are hundreds of events 
in our history which afford opportunity for just such 



simple treatment. It is that which makes valuable 
the monographs by Mr. Samuel Adams Drake, 
which he has grouped under the general title, 
" Decisive Events of American History." He has 
treated the " Taking of Louisburg," the " Burgoyne 
Invasion of 1777," the "Battle of Gettysburg"; 
and now he gives us the " Campaign of Trenton." 
The story begins with the movements around New- 
York which forced Washington to retreat through 
the Jerseys, and ends with the rejoicing over the bril- 
liant achievements amid ice and snow, as the Ameri- 
can army at Trenton and Princeton found the year 
of 1776 blending with 1777. There are various 
helpful diagrams and footnotes, and the volume, 
which may easily be read through at a short sitting, 
will appeal to everyone who examines it as worthy 
of a place upon the shelf. Mr. Drake has written 
much for the young, and it is a feature of his writ- 
ing that, while what he describes is always intelli- 
gible to the boys and girls, those of more mature 
mind never fail to find enjoyment and intellectual 
refreshment as they follow his leading through the 
fields of American history. 

The campaign of Trenton displayed the charac- 
ter of George Washington to better advantage, 
perhaps, than any other series of movements of the 
Revolution. But everywhere he proved his right to 
be considered " an indispensable man," as Gold win 
Smith has so well put it. Turning to the dainty 
bit of book-making called " George Washington Day 
by Day," this idea is emphasized, for in it, classi- 
fied according to the days of the year, the student 
may find countless reasons for disagreeing with Mr. 
McMaster in his statement, " Gaorge Washington 
is an unknown man." There are biographical data 
of pleasing interest, showing the little details of the 
life of the most illustrious of Americans ; there are 
important public acts of the great commander ; there 
are sentiments of a patriotic nature from distin- 
guished admirers of the Father of his Country ; 
there are illustrations of famous houses and public 
buildings connected with our early history, some of 
the ornamental chapter-headings being as sugges- 
tive as the more elaborate full-page engravings. 
The book was written primarily for boys and girls, 
but it is a veritable mine of information, and does 
not deserve classification with mere juveniles, since 
it is written in the best style, with each reference 
carefully identified, and each quotation carefully 
credited. 

In a certain passage Mr. Morse says that Thomas 
Jefferson, under particular conditions, did not hes- 
itate to speak respectfully of the Constitution and 
then disregard it. This has often been the fate of 
the Pilgrim Fathers. Every American is inclined 
to believe in the great obligation due to the foun- 
ders of New England, but there has been little in- 
terest in them, except as their quaint and curious 
lives have furnished materials for writers on social 
life, who have emphasized the amusing features. 
Those who have attempted description of the foun- 
dations of the society have too often been so influ-

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



enced by the heavy themes of theology that their 
volumes have not been readable. Such criticism 
can in no way be made of the new work by Dr. John 
Brown, " The Pilgrim Fathers of New England." 
Long familiar with the homes and haunts of the 
Mayflower settlers, he has written in charming style 
of the movements in Old England which led event- 
ually to the establishment of the New. The vol- 
ume readily divides itself into two parts, exactly 
half of it being devoted to the history of the Pil- 
grims before the sailing of the Mayflower. The 
first half is by far the more important. Every sin- 
gle inch of New England history has been traversed 
again and again ; every stone has been rolled over 
and over, until some of them, as if to disprove the 
ancient proverb, have gathered moss. But we do not 
remember to have found elsewhere that familiarity 
with life in the old world which is afforded by this 
most admirable work. The reader gets accurate im- 
pressions of the homes and the home life, of the steps 
toward separation from the established faiths, of 
the actual beliefs of the leaders of the Pilgrim move- 
ment ; and he goes on board the Mayflower for the 
famous epoch-making voyage with clearer notions 
of the purposes which animated those godly men 
and women, whose heroic courage and deep-seated 
devotion have been honored for nearly three cen- 
turies by all who cherish the heritage of American 
citizenship. The second part is written in the same 
interesting style, and is necessary to the complete- 
ness of the monograph. It contains many sugges- 
tions for students of the origin of the Constitution, 
and is a distinct contribution to the literature of 
American history. It strikes one as a little pecu- 
liar that, while other secondary sources are men- 
tioned in the select bibliography which accompanies 
the volume, the author does not seem to have heard 
of Goodwin's " Pilgrim Republic," or of Ellis's "The 
Puritan Age and Rule in the Colony of Massachu- 
setts Bay." 

Mr. Fernando G. Cartland has used a somewhat 
misleading title in his " Southern Heroes." One 
expects stories of Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jack- 
son, or of the boys in gray who sadly turned their 
faces southward after the mournful meeting at Ap- 
pomattox. But the sub-title, " The Friends in War 
Time," at once calls attention to the fact that not 
alone are those heroes who actually fight in war. 
George Washington was a hero, " day by day," as 
he carried on the campaign of Trenton, but so was 
Isaac Jogues, the Jesuit, who gave up his life while 
preaching to the Iroquois, and Marcus Whitman, 
who made the long journey over the mountains to 
carry to the Flatheads the story of the white man's 
God. The Pilgrim Fathers were heroes, as they 
sought a faith's pure shrine, and so were the Quak- 
ers, as they raised their voices for Freedom and 
lived their quiet lives of protest against War. 
" Southern Heroes " is a compilation of materials 
for history, rather than a history itself. It is the 
outcome of a desire to preserve the record of expe- 
riences of Southern Friends, who naturally favored 



the Union, but also found their faith against war at 
a time when and in a region where every able- 
bodied man was needed in the service of the Con- 
federacy, and who were tormented and persecuted 
in every possible way, many of them suffering un- 
told horrors under those who had charge of the 
prison pens at Andersonville and Salisbury. There 
are occasional digressions to show the work of the 
Friends elsewhere, the two chapters devoted to the 
" underground railroad " being a very interesting 
contribution to the history of that famous highway 
to freedom. The volume is one long protest against 
war, and it gives the reader a stronger regard for 
the peace-loving people who, by precept and exam- 
ple, since the days of George Fox, have been help- 
ing to hasten the coming of that glorious day when 
men shall beat their swords into ploughshares, their 
spears into pruning-hooks, and learn war no more.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



of Concord 

and Appledore. 



Mr - Frank P - Stearns's "Sketches 
from Concord and Appledore " (Put- 

nam ) j g a really delightful book, 

about evenly compounded of reminiscence, anecdote, 
and criticism. There are nine papers in all : " Con- 
cord Thirty-odd Years Ago"; "Hawthorne"; "Em- 
erson Himself"; "Matthew Arnold's Lectures"; 
" Whittier "; " David A. Wasson "; " Wendell 
Phillips," etc. Mr. Stearns says in his preface 
that his especial object is to attract public attention 
to the lives and works of Mr. Wasson and Mr. 
Phillips, " two distinguished men, one of whom has 
hitherto been little appreciated, and the other 
greatly misunderstood. Mr. Stearns's plea for his 
two friends is forcible and sincere, if perhaps not 
altogether convincing. The reminiscential and per- 
sonal portions of the book are fresh and interesting, 
affording us some instructive and amusing glimpses 
of the distinguished coterie of New England writ- 
ers whom it was the author's privilege to know more 
or less intimately. Hawthorne's shy, inscrutable 
face peeps out perhaps most frequently. Some ten 
years after his death, a friend, looking towards 
the Hawthorne house, asked Mr. Bronson Alcott, 
" Would you be surprised, Mr. Alcott, to see Na- 
thaniel Hawthorne some day gliding past your rus- 
tic fence as he used to do?" "No, sir, I should 
not," replied the old philosopher, " for while he 
lived he seemed to me like an apparition from some 
other world. I used to see him coming down from 
the woods between five and six o'clock, and if he 
caught sight of anyone in the road he would go un- 
der cover like a partridge. Those strange, suspi- 
cious side-glances of his ! They are not anywhere 
in his writings." Alas, the " getting under cover " 
and the " suspicious side-glances " may well have 
been not remotely connected with the approach or 
proximity of the wordy philosopher himself from

On things 
in general. 



whom, it is recorded, even the patient Emerson 
would sometimes flee in dismay. After the latter's 
death, the domestic, doing the honors of the unten- 
anted homestead to curious pilgrims, used to point 
to a certain low window and say : " That is the win- 
dow Mr. Emerson used to jump out of, when he 
saw Mr. Alcott coming down the garden path." 
So, at least, runs the story. Mr. Stearns's volume 
contains a number of illustrations, comprising Con- 
cord views, and portraits of Hawthorne, Miss Al- 
cott, Miss Thaxter, Mr. Whittier, and others. We 
should be sorry to have conveyed the impression 
that the book is a mere pleasant medley of chat and 
reminiscence. The author's appreciations of works 
and characters are often singularly just and discri- 
minating. 

Almost everybody has pretty good 
ideas nowadays, which may be the 
reason why people always talk when 
they get together, and especially why they make so 
many occasions to get together with nothing else to 
do but talk. It may also explain the number of 
columns and departments in the periodicals, called 
u Standpoints," " Men and Things," and so on. Peo- 
ple read them, not because they want information 
on any definite topic, but because they assume that 
the ideas, on whatever subject, will be good ; the 
particular subject is of minor import. Very often 
they are not disappointed ; if one gets one of the 
collections of such writing, he generally finds that 
the author has a good deal that is interesting. So 
it is with "Cousin Anthony and I" (Scribners). 
One has no idea to start with as to what Mr. E. S. 
Martin and his " Cousin Anthony" will talk about, but 
assumes that there will be some original or amusing 
ideas, some new things neatly put, some old things 
newly turned. Nor is the book a disappointment 
to such expectation. Mr. Martin's quality is pretty 
well known and liked, and this book is quite up to 
" Windfalls of Observation." In one respect, how- 
ever, this book has a characteristic which, as we re- 
member it, the other had not, namely, the ingenious 
way in which bits of writing on diverse topics are 
dove-tailed in together and made to seem as though 
they really had some connection. It would often 
puzzle the higher criticism to take the essays apart 
and tell why and when each separate bit was written. 
The result is, rather unfortunately for some readers 
perhaps, to emphasize the diffusive effect of such 
reading. It is interesting to think of the mental 
condition of the reader of such a book. He begins 
with a willingness to think any thoughts that "Cousin 
Anthony " and Mr. Martin may have had ; the intel- 
lect is in a state of readiness for anything, blank 
but on the alert. When the reader begins a partic- 
ular essay he can concentrate a little ; he can get 
down to " Civilization and Culture " or " Ourselves 
and Other People." Still he must be able to gather 
in the application to one subject of " English and 
American Homes," " Tips," " Japanese Manners," 
" French Traits "; he must be mentally ready to 



get the best out of everything. Such a necessity 
may be rather a strain for some people. But then, 
as we have remarked, whatever one gets is likely 
to be rather good. _ 

One of our strong literary interests 



ture, not only in English but in other 
languages. So we have the curious productions of 
John Davidson, Oscar Wilde, William Sharp, and 
turn with pleasure to Ibsen, Sudermann, and Mae- 
terlinck. Ranged now with these last names is that 
of the Spaniard Echegaray. Whether he turn out 
for us English-reading people merely a transitory 
" discovery " or a new planet in our ken, the two 
plays of his just translated " The Great Galeoto," 
and " Folly or Saintliness " (Lamson, Wolffe & Co.) 
are very striking things. The translation is made 
by Hannah Lynch, who also supplies a singularly 
discouraging preface. On reading this preface one 
gets rather a low-toned conception of the merits of 
the dramatist, and it is with no little rebound that 
one finishes an act or two of the first play and feels 
assured that things are on the whole better than the 
translator seems to imagine. Echegaray's plays 
are often set in romantic periods, but these two are 
plays of modern life, which is perhaps one of the 
reasons why they are more attractive than some of 
the others on which the translator comments. In 
them Echegaray handles a subject by no means 
new, the conflict of the modern conscience with 
the world. But he handles the topic with a sort of 
vigorous power and much originality. There is a 
refreshing simplicity and directness in the way in 
which he works straight ahead, without novelties of 
expression or eccentricities of conception. He at- 
tains his end by what seems really dramatic art. 
Character is not his strong point, nor humor, nor 
imagination, of the ordinary type at least, things 
which are good in the drama as elsewhere, but not 
of its essence. His effort seems to be to imagine 
certain people and certain circumstances, and then 
so to manipulate them that some idea, some concep- 
tion, shall be brought to white heat before the spec- 
tator. At any rate this is what he does most suc- 
cessfully in " The Great Galeoto," but well also in 
the other. Some of his plays have been already 
translated, but the two in this book are stronger 
work and probably more representative of their 
author. -

ric, that will wear well and suit all seasons. The 
central object of the book is, as its title implies, to 
point out to the average young man the general line 
of conduct he is to pursue in order (to adopt the

young man's own phraseology) to " get there " in life, 
and possibly to become a " magnate " of some sort 
or other. Mr. Bok, however, has a good deal of ad- 
vice to offer on topics less severely practical, such 
as "Social Life and Amusements," "Religious 
Life," "Attitude towards Women," "Matters of 
Dress," etc. Mr. Bok's little book contains much 
sound precept tersely and plainly put ; and it may 
be read with profit by those for whom it is meant. 
Another book similar in character to Mr. Bok's 
is Mr. Orison Swett Marden's " Architects of Fate " 
(Houghton), described by its author as "a book 
designed to inspire youth to character-building, self- 
culture, and noble achievements." It is a compan- 
ion volume to Mr. Marden's " Pushing to the Front," 
which has run through several editions. Mr. Mar- 
den's method is largely the time-honored one of 
teaching by examples ; and of these he has got- 
ten together, and classified under such headings as 
"Dare," "Self-Help," "Clear Grit," "The Will 
and the Way," etc., a most bewildering variety from 
sources the most diverse. Mr. Marden's labors, of 
the excerpting and arranging order, must have been 
something really appalling ; and one is glad to re- 
flect that his method was one which relieved him 
from the additional strain of severe and continuous 
thought. A notable feature of the volume is the 
portraits of eminent people Columbus, Walter 
Scott, Hamilton, Lafayette, Irving, Ruskin, Blaine, 
Edison, Clay, and so on. Mr. Marden's style is 
rather spasmodic, and his reflections are sometimes 
trite ; but his book is, in the main, an excellent one 
for popular reading, and should repeat the success 
of its predecessor. 



Tnne*ee'* 
constitutional 



^ n a convenient volume entitled 
" Studies in the Constitutional His- 
tory of Tennessee (Robert Clarke 
Co.), Mr. Joshua W. Caldwell of that state presents 
many of the more prominent features of its consti- 
tutional development. He begins with the early 
attempts at the establishment of an independent 
government in the western wilderness : Watauga, 
1772 ; Cumberland, 1780 ; and Franklin, 1 784. He 
calls due attention to the distinctive characteristics 
of these early constitutions, chief among which were 
general suffrage and religious freedom. His criti- 
cism that the Franklin experiment at state-making 
in 1784 is, in historic importance, inferior to its two 
predecessors, seems hardly justified by the facts 
which the author presents, showing it to be a step 
in a continuous evolution. In his claim that the 
Watauga settlers " were the first Americans to estab- 
lish absolutely free and democratic institutions," he 
seems to ignore the earlier example of Rhode Island. 
The causes which led the New England settlers to 
adopt the township system of government, while 
those of the " Virginia group " of colonies preferred 
the county system, are tersely set forth. It is a 
part of Mr. Caldwell's thesis that, under present 
conditions, the township system should not only be 
preferred in the South, but that that region now 



needs, for its full development, the form of local 
self-government by which New England democracy 
became so successful ; and he urges that an early 
constitutional revision in Tennessee shall abolish the 
outgrown county system and erect upon its ruins 
the township system. His account of the early jeal- 
ousy of the Tennessee settlers toward their courts 
and judges shows that in Tennessee, as well as un- 
der the national constitution, the power of the judi- 
ciary has been a growth from feeble beginnings. 
Mr. Caldwell would have made this part of his 
thesis more clear by reference to the official oath 
first prescribed for her judges, by which Tennessee, 
in imitation of North Carolina, sought to furnish 
backbone for the development of a truly independ- 
ent judiciary. 

We do not have much literary criti- 
on*ut"a? y ' l t pics. cism . nowadays, except in homeo- 
pathic doses. Few of our magazines 
have anything of the sort ; Travel, Art, Politics, 
Questions of the Day, Biography, Fiction, are more 
interesting to the public, and so are provided in 
larger quantity. So there is no place to publish 
long articles, and then it is easier to write short 
ones. In England it is still the tradition that some 
literary articles are to be included in the monthly 
reviews, but even in England much of the best writ- 
ing goes into the comparatively short articles of the 
literary weeklies. For these reasons we have lately 
had several collections of short essays, of which "Im- 
pressions and Memories," by Mr. J. Ashcroft Noble 
(Putnam), is a good example. Too short for more 
than a pleasant resum or a judicious noting of a 
few salient points, such essays are rather unsatis- 
factory in book form. One can hardly put them 
on the shelf along with more solid literary criticism : 
one reads them and is apt to forget them. But 
aside from the inevitable disadvantage of form, 
these particular essays are excellent, a pleasure to 
read, and, as often as not, with something to re- 
member. There are a few essays on general critical 
subjects, particularly a very interesting one on " The 
Music of Prose." There are also, though less success- 
ful in giving a definite idea, one or two bits of direct 
criticism, as on Christina Rossetti, or Dr. Holmes. 
But the greater number are on what would be called 
in a general way " literary topics " " The Charm 
of Autobiography," "The Hypocrite of Fiction," 
and so on, and answering probably to the " mem- 
ories " of the title, are several sketches of places 
pleasant in themselves and made noteworthy by the 
life of some man of letters. 

No suggestion of its contents is given 
in the title " In a Walled Garden" 
(Macmillan), which is a collection 
of essays and reminiscences by Mme. Bessie Rayner 
Belloc, an advanced woman of her time, a devout 
Catholic, and the intimate friend of George Eliot. 
The papers are written in a somewhat disconnected 
and rambling style, as if they were familiar letters 
to a friend ; scattered recollections, odds and ends

nearing the close of her life. The essays " The 
Modesty of Nature," "On Living Well to the 
Front," and three suggested by the theories of 
Count Tolstoy are mere suggestions of her 
thoughts, rather than completed wholes. The rem- 
iniscences, chiefly of people she knew in her early 
life, have an old-world atmosphere of times not so 
far gone by, and are full of interest for this gener- 
ation, particularly the chapters on George Eliot, 
Mary Howitt, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, and the 
one entitled " Montagus and Procters." One of 
the more recent characters described is Catherine 
Booth, the " mother of the Salvation Army." The 
paper on " Dr. Manning of Bayswater " is of especial 
interest in view of Mr. PurcelFs recently published 
life of the Cardinal. " A Chapter of War " and 
" The Shoemaker's Story " deal with the Franco- 
Prussian War, of which Mme. Belloc had personal 
knowledge, having been driven from her home in 
Bougival by the approach of the Germans. The 
book as a whole forms a pleasant addition to those 
bits of literary history which serve to throw side- 
lights on the great people of the world. 

Mr. John Kendrick Bangs's humor- 
ous extravaganza entitled "A House- 
Boat on the Styx" (Harper) has 
already appeared in serial form, and calls for little 
in the way of comment or description. Mr. Bangs's 
device of grouping a lot of more or less celebrated 
"shades" Homer, Shakespeare, Confucius, Arte- 
mus Ward, Emerson, Socrates, P. T. Barnum, and 
so forth on board a Stygian house-boat, surround- 
ing them with earthly " modern conveniences," and 
making them talk in a flippant, slangy, up-to-date 
dialect, is at least a novel one, and the resulting 
incongruities make us laugh in spite of ourselves. 
Mr. Bangs shows us, for instance, Dr. Johnson, 
" playing pool with Nero," and addressing Shake- 
speare with : " Hullo, William ! How 's our little 
Swanlet of Avon this afternoon ? " while Lord 
Bacon settles a vexed question by saying : " Shake- 
speare was my stenographer, gentlemen. If you 
want to know the whole truth, he did write ' Hamlet,' 
literally. But it was at my dictation." Mr. Bangs's 
fun is rather enjoyable at times ; but candor com- 
pels us to say that, in our opinion, a generation 
which can relish it in book doses is intellectually 
past praying for. The book is a pretty one out- 
wardly, and contains the quaint original cuts. 

Some men are admitted to the calen- 

dar of S reat men not on account of 
the magnitude and number of their 
achievements, but because of what they have shown 
themselves to be in the lesser deeds they have had 
to perform. In Mr. Bradley's life of General Wolfe, 
recently added to the " English Men of Action " 
series (Macmillan), we have the story of a great 
soldier told in a most fascinating way. Wolfe was 
only thirty-two when he died, and the Quebec expe- 



dition was his first independent command ; but his 
success was based upon seventeen years of intense 
application to his profession, and every duty as- 
signed him had been perfectly done. The ministry 
that sent the young colonel to take the Canadian 
stronghold little realized the hopelessness of the un- 
dertaking. Wolfe himself was at the point of despair. 
But he would not fail. To have failed in accom- 
plishing the impossible, if that were set him to do, 
would have broken his heart. He succeeded, and 
by one stroke put his name on the short list of great 
English soldiers. This little book is a hero-tale 
that stirs one's enthusiasm. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The new edition of Professor C. A. Young's "The 
Sun " (Appleton) acquaints its readers with the remark- 
able results of the last fifteen years of investigation, 
and brings the subject fully up to date. We have given 
the latest solar parallax determinations, the spectro- 
scopic work of Professors Hale and Deslandres, accounts 
of prominence photography and coronal observation, 
Professor Langley's infra-red spectrum investigations, 
and even so new a subject as the discovery of terrestrial 
helium. It is one of the best books of popular science 
ever written, and deserves to find a host of readers. 

Karma, a Story of Early Buddhism," by Dr. Paul 
Carus, is a recent publication of The Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co. It is a prettily-written moral apologue, 
issued in a form that is sure to attract attention. The 
booklet is manufactured in Tokyo, printed on a curious 
kind of Crepe paper, and illustrated in colors by Japan- 
ese artists. The drawings are very charming, and will 
repay close study; some of them are full-page designs, 
while others share their pages with the text. 

A new and beautifully-printed edition of " The Mar- 
vellous Adventures of Sir John Maundevile, Kt.," ed- 
ited and strikingly illustrated by Mr. Arthur Layard, 
having also a preface by Mr. John Cameron Grant, 
comes to us from Messrs. Macmillan & Co. We hope 
that this edition may acquaint a good many people, who 
have hitherto thought of the work as possessing only 
antiquarian interest, with the fact that it offers delight- 
fully entertaining reading for both young and old. A 
more fetching dress than this, at least, the work could 
not easily have, with its rich covers, its clear type, and 
its quaintly sympathetic designs. 

We note the publication of two very helpful guides 
for the reading of the young. One is a " List of Books 
for Girls and Women and their Clubs," edited by Miss 
Augusta H. Leypoldt and Mr. George lies, and pub- 
lished by the Boston Library Bureau. Over two thou- 
sand works are enumerated, classified, and briefly char- 
acterized. Each section of the work is prepared by a 
specialist, Mr. Krehbiel, for example, writing of music, 
Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller of natural history, and Mr. 
Russell Sturgis of fine art. The comments on books of 
fiction are by "a reviewer for the 'Nation'". The 
characterizations are terse and usually trustworthy. Our 
other book of this class is Mr. W. M. Griswold's " De- 
scriptive List of Books for the Young " (" descriptiv " 
is the perverse way in which Mr. Griswold spells it). 
History and fiction are the chief groups in this bibli- 
ography. Both of these works are simply invaluable.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" The Heroes " has just been added to the Macmillan 
" Pocket Edition " of Kingsley. 

The third volume of Mr. James Hamilton Wylie's 
" History of England under Henry the Fourtl," cover- 
ing the period 1407-1410, has just appeared from the 
press of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. A fourth 
volume, which the author hopes " will not be long de- 
layed," will complete the work. 

" Coriolanus " and " Troilus and Cressida " are added 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. to their " Temple " Shake- 
speare. The Roman Forum and the Swan Theatre are 
the subjects of the etched frontispieces. The same pub- 
lishers send us " Enoch Arden " and the second half of 
" The Princess " in the " People's " Tennyson. 

The beautiful edition of the " Faerie Queene," now 
publishing in parts, is progressing apace. Part XL, in- 
cluding Cantos 5 to 8 of the Fourth Book, is the latest 
to appear. Mr. Crane's illustrations are as original and 
graceful as ever, and really illustrate the text of the 
poem. Messrs. Macmillan & Co. are the publishers. 

The founders of " McClure's Magazine " have under- 
taken to establish at Knox College a new department, 
to be known as " The Abraham Lincoln School of Sci- 
ence and Practical Arts." It is expected that an en- 
dowment fund of a quarter of a million dollars will be 
raised for this purpose. Knox College will celebrate in 
October the anniversary of the Lincoln and Douglas 
debate. 

Professor Cowell, of Cambridge, who has just com- 
pleted his seventieth year, was presented on his birth- 
day with his portrait, which has been painted at the cost 
of fifty-six of his old pupils and others who in maturer 
years have continued to work with him at any of the 
numerous languages Sanskrit, Persian, Pali, Old 
Welsh, to say nothing of Italian and Spanish in which 
the veteran professor is thoroughly versed. 

Messrs. Way & Williams announce for early publi- 
cation " The Lamp of Gold," a sonnet sequence com- 
posed of forty-nine sonnets divided into seven parts of 
seven sonnets each, by Miss Florence L. Snow, with dec- 
orations by Mr. E. H. Garrett; a collection of stories 
by Mrs. E. W. Peattie, entitled " A Mountain Woman "; 
and a new Irish novel by Mr. Frank Matthew, called 
" The Apostle of Temperance." The same publishers 
say that the interest in Mrs. Wynne's book, " The Little 
Room and Other Stories," now in its second thousand, 
is on the increase. 

The MS. of " Trilby " is preserved in a locked glass 
case at the rooms of the Fine Art Society of London. 
It is written in little exercise-books, each of which cost 
a penny, and is not entirely in Mr. Du Manner's hand. 
That author has a pet superstition to the effect that all 
the members of his family should take a small part in 
the work of writing out his imaginings. Consequently 
the MS. exhibits various calligraphies. A translation of 
" Trilby " has lately appeared in Russia, with Mr. Du 
Maurier's illustrations. It is printed under the title of 
" Katia," and is ascribed to one Teminoff "; and all the 
names are altered to Russian ones the three immortal 
Companions of the Brush being turned into Russians. 

The New York State Library has just issued its sixth 
annual comparative summary and index of state legisla- 
tion, covering the laws passed in 1895 by thirty-seven 
states and two territories. Each law is briefly de- 
scribed or summarized and classified under its proper 



subject-head, with a full alphabetic index to the 4847 
entries. There is steadily growing appreciation of this 
Bulletin by all persons interested in improving state 
legislation. It is already widely used and helps ma- 
terially in raising standards and promoting uniformity 
in the laws of the different states. This year additional 
intermediate marginal heads give closer classification 
and make it much easier to grasp the contents rapidly. 
The great problems of municipal government have re- 
ceived special attention. 

Mr. Charles Sprague-Smith is conducting in New 
York a series of weekly " conferences upon literature." 
Each conference opens with a paper by Mr. Sprague- 
Smith, which is followed by supplementary papers and 
a general discussion. The method is thus described: 
"Starting with a great epic poem, which voiced the 
thought of a primitive age and civilization, the litera- 
ture of which this poem formed the centre is followed 
in its evolution. Where it has inspired some greater 
production, that all recognize as belonging to universal 
literature, the attention is centred upon this, and a 
comparison made between the new and old expressions 
of the ideal. In every conference one of these supreme 
moments is considered, and the monument it produced 
placed in its historical and literary setting, with the 
lines of development traced up to and away from it."

FROM AN ADVANCE REVIEW IN THE 
CHICAGO TRIBUNE : 

" In this new novel Mrs. TZurnett bas returned to her older 
manner. Here we find the author of ' That Lass o' Lowrie's.' 
It is decidedly the best story Mrs. 'Burnett has written since 
' That Lass o' Lowrie's/ and is marked by the same virility. 
It is in an entirely new vein for Mrs. Burnett. The scene 
is laid in England, and the action takes place at the end 
of the seventeenth century, hut the newest of 'new women' 
might envy the independence of Clorinda Wildairs. The story 
is one of the most original and vigorous that we have read 
in many a long day. Clorinda is a character that will live, 
for she is of real flesh and blood. The story of Clorinda' s 
birth, and the death of her unhappy mother, is a touching 
one, and leaves a picture on the mother's mind that will not 
be forgotten. In Clorinda Mrs. Burnett has drawn an orig- 
inal character, and one that is not disappointing, in that 
she is consistent."

too well known to need illustration. The stories are without exception

opinions are those of an expert who has made a personal examination 
of the Nicaragua Canal route, and carefully studied the various prob- 
lems involved in the building of the canal. In a matter of such vast 
importance we need all the light we can get, and above all we need the 
opinions of independent engineers, under no obligations to take rosy

A CRISIS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. 

The public schools of Chicago have, on the 
whole, approved themselves to the intelligent 
educational opinion of the country. They have 
shared in the defects of all large city systems 
of education, but, relatively to other systems of 
similar magnitude, they have done well, and 
their management has been liberal, progressive, 
and fruitful of good results. They constitute 
a well-organized system, fitting their students 
both for the practical demands of life and for 
the prosecution of work along higher educa- 
tional lines. They have construed education 
to mean something more than mechanical in- 
struction and text-book memorizing, to mean 
rather the development of the whole nature of 
the child, physical, moral, and intellectual. 
They have enriched their curricula in a note- 
worthy degree with those elements of culture 
of which the older public education had slight 
knowledge, and which the saner modern view 
holds no less essential than the time-honored 
fundamentals. They have developed the ob- 
servant faculties by substituting objects to be 
seen and handled for pages of print to be 
learned. They have encouraged the study of 
nature, and have sought to train the mind, in 
large part, at least, through training of the eye 
and the hand. They have done much, by the 
provision of libraries and supplementary read- 
ing-books, to make of reading a pleasure instead 
of a dull formal exercise. They have done 
away with the old break between the grammar 
school and the high school by placing the be- 
ginnings of the higher studies in the lower 
grades. And they have done all these things, 
and done them fairly well, for a population that 
has been increasing more rapidly than in any 
other large city of the United States. Even in 
the matter of providing accommodations for all 
applicants, the Chicago schools have done as 
much as could reasonably have been expected. 
It is true that some buildings are rented, and 
that others are lacking in modern improvments, 
but the frequently reiterated charge that ele- 
mentary education is not provided for all appli- 
cants is true only in the sense that some of the 
lower grades have " double divisions "; in other 
words, that some children six or seven years of 



158 



THE DIAL

age go to school for three hours a day instead 
of going for five. 

The Common Council of Chicago, in making 
its appropriations from the taxes of 1896, has 
just seen fit to reduce the estimates of the 
Board of Education by more than two millions 
of dollars. Since the taxes for one year are 
not collected until the year following, this re- 
duction applies to the school expenses of 1897. 
The greater part of the reduction is made in 
the estimate for new sites and school buildings, 
but a considerable fraction of it falls upon the 
estimate for " educational purposes "; that is, 
for salaries and supplies. It is doubtless un- 
fortunate that the work of providing new build- 
ings should be thus arrested, for it will make 
the task of " catching up " all the harder in 
the future ; but its only immediate effect will be 
to increase the number of " double divisions," 
which is not, after all, a very serious evil. The 
reduced estimate for " educational purposes " 
is, unfortunately, made absolutely unavoidable 
by the constitutional limitation and the dis- 
graceful condition into which the assessment 
system has fallen in Chicago. The tendency 
to lower assessments in order to lower the basis 
of state and municipal taxation is at work every- 
where in the United States, but is not often 
carried as far as it has recently been carried in 
this city. For several years past, the assessed 
value of Chicago property has been declining 
(while the real value has, of course, been grow- 
ing), until it now amounts to about one-tenth 
of what the law directs it to be. That is, prop- 
erty actually worth in the neighborhood of 
twenty-five hundred millions is estimated, for 
purposes of taxation, as worth less than two 
hundred and fifty millions. Now, the Illinois 
Constitution limits the expenditure of the city 
for " educational purposes " to a two per cent 
rate upon this assessment ; the appropriation 
for such purposes has at last reached the full 
amount allowed by this rate, and we are con- 
fronted with the fact that it is not enough for 
the educational needs of the city. Hence, it 
may be said without exaggeration that a crisis 
in public-school education is upon the city, and 
that the problem of making the wisest use of 
the inadequate amount provided is not easy of 
solution. 

When educational affairs become a subject 
of popular discussion it is nearly always found 
that a certain undercurrent of narrow and pre- 
judiced or ignorant thought comes to the sur- 
face, and has considerable influence in shaping 
the final decision. The newspapers may too 



often be counted upon to lead the attack upon 
whatever is most valuable in a public- school 
system. In Chicago, at least, and probably 
elsewhere, the chief points of popular attack 
upon the public schools are three in number : 
1. The salaries paid for the higher kinds of 
work. 2. The new subjects of instruction that 
the more enlightened educational ideals of re- 
cent years have added to the curriculum. 3. 
The high schools. The educational interests of 
every large city are always peculiarly in dan- 
ger of being crippled by an attack at these three 
points, and what we have to say about them, 
although illustrated by the problem as now 
existing in Chicago, has a far wider applica- 
tion than to the situation in any one city. 

That the compensation bestowed upon those 
who do the higher grades of work should be 
singled out for popular attack simply offers one 
more illustration of an intellectual defect that 
seems inherent in democracy, of the inability to 
understand why one man's services should be 
so much more valuable than another's. The lev- 
elling tendency that results from this misappre- 
hension is conspicuous in all departments of 
our public life, from the school service of a city 
to the national service of the capital. Almost 
everywhere it is found that the lower grades of 
work receive compensation at a rate relatively 
too high, while the higher grades are relatively 
underpaid. We fail thereby to command the 
best leadership and executive ability, while, on 
the other hand, the evil of place-hunting be- 
comes greatly magnified. Yet when, for ex- 
ample, the cry of retrenchment in the school 
expenses of a city is heard, an outcry is at once 
made that the burden should fall chiefly or 
wholly upon those who, while receiving the 
larger salaries, are still relatively underpaid in 
proportion to the importance of their work. It 
thus often happens that a burden which would 
be trifling if equitably distributed, becomes 
intolerable when loaded upon the shoulders of 
the few, and the educational work of the city 
is forced to depend for leadership upon a still 
lower grade of ability than before, thus becom- 
ing weakened at the very points where strength 
is most needed. Of all the forms of the socialist 
propaganda, that which takes the shape of a 
graduated tax is the most insidious and the 
most dangerous. It is the most insidious be- 
cause its effect is so disguised that compara- 
tively few people take the trouble to think for 
themselves what it really means, the most dan- 
gerous because it subverts a fundamental prin- 
ciple of justice. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



159 



The popular attack upon the enriched mod- 
ern curriculum usually begins with stigmatiz- 
ing all the new subjects and methods by apply- 
ing to them collectively some such epithet as 
" fads," a term especially chosen that the argu- 
ment may start with a prejudice in its favor. 
The cost of each "fad," such as drawing 
(Heaven save the mark !), singing, or the study 
of nature, is then carefully figured out, and the 
public is invited to contemplate the frightful 
waste of good money upon ornamental work. 
The fact that skilled educators are practically 
unanimous in regarding such subjects as equal in 
educational value to any others is carefully con- 
cealed from the readers to whom the young men 
who carry on the newspaper crusades appeal ; 
and the other fact that to reduce a school cur- 
riculum to the simple old-fashioned terms would 
reduce expenses slightly, if at all, is concealed 
with even greater care. Of course, anyone who 
stops long enough to do a little elementary 
thinking upon the subject can see that the whole 
question is not one of expense, but simply one 
of educational theory and method. A certain 
subject, it is said, costs the city so many thou- 
sands of dollars annually. Yes, but to do away 
with that subject would not result in any con- 
siderable saving. It would simply release a 
certain number of hours to be applied to other 
kinds of work in the charge of other instruc- 
tors. In any public school system the unit of 
cost is the schoolroom with its teacher. For 
every fifty children, say, there must be a room 
and a teacher. Multiply the number of rooms 
by the average salary paid, add from five to ten 
per cent for supervision, and the result is the 
total cost for instruction. Starve or enrich the 
curriculum as much as you please, the total cost 
will be but slightly affected by either course. 
The question is wholly one of educational theory, 
not in any sense one of public policy, and the 
public at large is not entitled to an effective 
opinion upon a question that nowise concerns 
the pocket. 

Last of all, we wish to say a few words about 
high schools. The high school is perhaps the 
most characteristic product of American ideals 
of education, and is so firmly intrenched in the 
good-will and sympathy of the vast majority of 
taxpayers that it may safely be counted upon 
to hold its own. Yet there is no doubt that in 
our larger cities a certain numerically small 
but active element of antagonism to the high 
school as an institution makes itself felt upon 
critical occasions, and succeeds in weakening 
the influence and efficiency of high-school work. 



The arguments directed against the high school 
may be reduced to three. 1. Its work is orna- 
mental and therefore superfluous. 2. Only a 
small percentage of the school population re- 
ceives its benefits, while all are taxed for its 
support. 3. It is mainly an institution for the 
wealthy classes, who alone send their children to 
it. To the first of these arguments we may re- 
ply that the question involved is one of degree 
and not of kind. No one, not invincible in his 
own ignorance, can safely divide school work 
into two sorts, the useful and the ornamental ; 
nor can anyone, subject to the exception before 
noted, intelligently assert that the leaven of 
good citizenship (which it is the chief object 
of all public schools to produce), is less suc- 
cessfully cultivated in the high school than in 
the school of lower grade. The only question 
suitable for the public to consider is that of the 
number of years for which it is proposed to 
support a school system, and the answer will 
depend upon the economic condition of the com- 
munity concerned. If the majority decides for 
a twelve-year course, those who would have pre- 
ferred eight years, or six, or ten, cannot fairly 
claim that any question of principle is involved 
in their disagreement. The argument that high 
schools being for the few, the many should not 
be taxed for their support, may be disposed of 
in a similar way. Here again we have merely 
a question of degree. If a public-school sys- 
tem covered only two years of study, there 
would be fewer children in the second year 
than in the first. Whatever the length of the 
course, there will be fewer students in each 
year than in the year preceding. Or, taking 
the argument of " the few and the many," as 
it is sometimes put, it would be just as fair 
to select any one school, high or low, in a city 
system, and say : " This school only accommo- 
dates five per cent of the children of the com- 
munity, yet all the community is taxed for its 
support. Behold the monstrous injustice ! " 
Such is the logic with which the friends of 
public education sometimes have to contend. 

As for the final argument of the enemies of 
the high school, it more often than not rests 
upon a falsehood. We do not know how it is 
in all other cities, but we assert that in Chicago, 
at least (and the assertion is based upon a 
quarter-century of intimate acquaintance with 
the facts), the high schools are not institutions 
for the wealthy and well-to-do classes. It might 
very reasonably be argued that if they were, 
there would be no inherent injustice in the ar- 
rangement, since the wealthy classes pay taxes

in a proportion greatly exceeding the number 
of their children ; but there is no necessity for 
resorting to this plea. The truth of the mat- 
ter is that in Chicago parents of all classes very 
generally send their children to the public 
schools of primary and grammar grade, but 
that when these children reach the high school 
grade a considerable fraction of them are taken 
out of the public schools and sent to private 
institutions. Hence, as far as any class dis- 
tinction of patronage exists at all, it operates 
in the direction of restricting the benefits of 
the high schools to the poorer classes, of mak- 
ing them, in the phrase of a popular rhetoric, 
the "poor man's colleges." Moreover, the 
high schools of a compact and well-organized 
system like that of Chicago are in a very real 
sense the most important part of the whole. 
They not only perform the usual function of 
higher schools in holding up the lower schools 
to a fair standard of efficiency, in acting as the 
keystone of the whole educational arch ; but 
they also perform the far more important ser- 
vice of training for their work nearly all the 
teachers of the lower grades. The expanding 
educational system of Chicago requires every 
year some three or four hundred new teachers, 
and the great majority of them are selected 
from the graduates of the high schools. With 
this fact in view, it is simply amazing that 
anyone should seriously think the high-school 
system of the city either unimportant or orna- 
mental, that anyone having the interests of 
education at heart should not realize that a 
weakening of the high-school work would be the 
most serious disaster possible, making its unfor- 
tunate consequences felt, not merely at the time 
when it occurred, but for long years to come. 



A SONNET OF OBLIVION. 



The earth hath holy places, unadorned 
With sculpture or commemorative brass; 
Across whose ways unheeding footsteps pass, 

Whose memories by forgetfulness are scorned. 

Well were it if some solemn voice had warned, 
" Tread softly; in this dewy, velvet grass 
The daisy grew that Chaucer plucked. Alas, 

Such blossoms spring no more, and few have mourned." 

Nature's true heart alone doth now enfold 

The tree where Herrick carved his Julia's name; 

Keats' " little hill " forgotten long ago. 
Yet would that we could bind in grateful gold 

The bank of thyme that shares in Shakespeare's fame, 
The path Vittoria trod with Angelo.

THE NEW "KING ARTHUR." 



In selecting the old story of King Arthur and his 
Knights of the Round Table as a good subject for 
stage treatment, Sir Henry Irving has followed in 
the footsteps of many previous stage managers, in- 
cluding Garrick, Kemble, and Macready ; and Mr. 
J. Comyns Carr, in writing the play, has had as 
predecessors William Rowley, John Dryden, and 
many less -known dramatists. How far back we 
should have to go in dramatic history to find the 
first play founded on this popular theme is some- 
thing only to be conjectured. That there was an 
exhibition of mingled archery and pageantry called 
" Arthur's Show " in the time of Henry VIII. is 
known, and that it continued until Shakespeare's 
time and was seen by him is probable from his allu- 
sion to it in the Second Part of King Henry IV., 
where Justice Shallow says to Falstaff, " I remem- 
ber at Mile End Green (when I lay at Clement's 
Inn) I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's Show." 
Mile End Green was a training-ground near Lon- 
don, and the troupe consisted of an association of 
archers who personated characters taken from the 
old romance of " Morte d'Arthur," a magnificent 
prose poem written by Sir Thomas Mallory in 1461. 
But neither was Mallory himself the originator of 
these knightly tales. He wrought his narrative from 
old Welsh and Breton ballads and from the " Chan- 
sons de Geste," as Homer wrought his " Iliad " 
from the preceding warlike ballads, or as the un- 
known compiler of the " Niebelungenlied " wrought 
his poem from similar ancient sources. Living 
when men still wore armor, and so near to the ac- 
tual age of chivalry as to be in full sympathy with 
the spirit of its fiction, the good knight gave to these 
stories an epic completeness which they lacked be- 
fore, and created a group of real men and women, 
and not a series of lay figures on a background of 
romance, as were his originals. Tbe characteristics 
with which he endowed these individualities have 
persisted throughout all the centuries since. Kay 
is still the man of satirical tongue, Lancelot is bold 
and chivalrous, Elaine tender and trusting, Arthur 
kingly but adventurous, Guinevere jealous but 
queenly, when they step upon the stage to-day as 
when they first received the breath of life from 
Mallory. 

To speak of Mr. Carr's new play as a dramati- 
zation of Tennyson's " Idylls of the King," or to 
judge it, as many seem inclined to do, according as 
it follows or departs from that delightful poem, is 
to show a very inadequate understanding of the sit- 
uation. The fact is that the mystical figures of 
Arthur and his knights have quite stepped out of 
the historic page and are recognized as the common 
property of all imaginative writers. It is no exag- 
geration when it is said of Mallory 's " Morte d'Ar- 
thur " that " it is as truly the epic of the English 
mind as the ' Iliad ' is the epic of the Greek mind." 
Whether there ever was an actual Arthur, King of

Britain, or not is nothing to the purpose ; but the 
truth remains that he has appealed to the imagina- 
tion of English writers oftener, probably, than any 
other figure, real or fictitious. Milton long had in 
mind an epic with King Arthur as hero, but aban- 
doned it for " Paradise Lost "; Spenser took his ma- 
chinery for the " Faerie Queene " from the popular 
legends about King Arthur ; Dryden wrote a drama 
and projected an epic on the theme ; Bulwer wrote 
a heavy " King Arthur " which nobody reads ; Ten- 
nyson wrote a series of splendid poems which every- 
body reads, and thus to most people King Arthur 
is the Arthur of the " Idylls of the King." 

Mr. Carr, like his predecessors, has allowed his 
imagination to have its way with the old material, 
and has felt at liberty to use such portions as seemed 
to him best suited to his own purposes. This pur- 
pose being to make a good stage play, the proper 
test to apply to his work is his success or failure in 
this respect. At least this must be said of it, that 
it is much more satisfactory than the effort of any 
previous playwright, as may be seen by passing the 
others hastily in review. 

It is interesting to note that it is exactly 309 
years ago namely, on the 28th of February, 1587 
that the earliest instance of which we have any 
record, a play called " The Misfortunes of Arthur 
(Uther Pendragon's Son) " was presented before 
Queen Elizabeth at the court in Greenwich. Then, as 
now, the cast included Arthur, Guinevere, Mordred, 
and the train of valiant knights. The play was 
preceded by a prologue, and each act had an argu- 
ment, a dumb show, and a chorus. A curious cir- 
cumstance in connection therewith is that Francis 
Bacon's name occurs in the list of writers by whom 
the dumb shows and additional speeches were 
"partly devised." So, whatever may be assumed 
concerning the Baconian authorship of the Shake- 
speare plays, it is reasonably certain that Sir Francis 
had something to do with the production and com- 
position of at least one Elizabethan play. During 
the same year, it was " reduced into tragicall notes " 
by Thomas Hughes, one of the Society of Gray's 
Inn by whom the play had been presented, and 
afterwards printed. Copies of this book are now 
extremely rare ; a more accessible reprint may be 
found in the little volume edited by John Payne 
Collier, under the title " Five Old Plays." There 
is no indication that the play ever became popular ; 
nor was Richard Hathawaye's play, " The Life of 
Arthur, King of England," two years later, more 
successful. 

One other Elizabethan dramatist William Row- 
ley was attracted by the Arthurian legends. He 
called his play " The Birth of Merlin." For many 
years this play was attributed to Shakespeare. 
Translated into German, it may be found in the 
Newberry Library, Chicago, included in the first 
volume of the complete works of Shakespeare in 
German. 

The first of the King Arthur plays to become 
really popular was the " dramatic opera " of John 



Dryden in 1691, called " King Arthur, or the Brit- 
ish Worthy." It was received with great applause 
at its first appearance, was often repeated, and held 
its place on the stage longer than any other of Dry- 
den's numerous plays. Doubtless a considerable 
part of its success on its first presentation was due 
to the fact that its cast included such actors as Bet- 
terton, Kynaston, and Mrs. Bracegirdle, and that 
the music was written by the foremost composer of 
his time, Henry Purcell. Dr. Burney in his " His- 
tory of Music " says of this work of Purcell's, " A 
century has not injured it, and especially the duet 
of Sirens in the enchanted forest, ' Two Daughters 
of this Aged Stream,' and the ' Fairest Isle all Isles 
Excelling,' contain not a single passage that the best 
composers of the present times, if it presented itself 
to their imaginations, would reject." 

Strange as it seems, although the text of the play 
was published in 1691, this delightful music, with 
the exception of a few songs, remained unpublished 
until 1843, when all that could be collected was 
issued by the Musical Antiquarian Society. A copy 
of this volume, which includes text, music, and his- 
tory of the play, is in the Newberry Library. 

The most important revivals of the play have 
been, in 1770, under Garrick, with Bannister, Mrs. 
Baddeley, and Thomas Jefferson (ancestor of our 
much-loved actor) in the cast, and with additional 
music by another eminent composer, Dr. Arne ; in 
1784, under Kemble, with Mr. Kemble as King 
Arthur and Miss Farren as leading lady ; in 1842, 
under Macready, when it had a run of thirty- three 
successive nights at Drury Lane Theatre. 

As for the play itself, it has little to do with the 
king and his knights. The scene is laid in Kent, 
and the story resembles a fairy extravaganza ; there 
is an enchanted wood with a Saxon magician and a 
British enchanter, an " airy " spirit and an " earthly " 
spirit, and many dances. 

In 1776, William Hilton, a poet of little merit, 
wrote a tragedy called " Arthur, Monarch of the 
Britens," which he never succeeded in getting ac- 
cepted at any theatre, and there is a record of a 
tragedy by E. J. Riethmuller, published in London 
in 1841, which seems to have been equally unfortu- 
nate. 

Thus the " King Arthur " of Mr. Carr, first pre- 
sented at the Lyceum Theatre in London on Jan. 
15, 1895, and with the cast much the same as now 
playing in America, is easily chief among the stage 
King Arthurs. He is a flesh-and-blood hero, sur- 
rounded by knights and ladies clearly individual- 
ized, who, while moving in a world whose manners 
are remote from our own, yet appeal to our modern 
taste and serve to make us realize why this chival- 
ric romance was the favorite fictitious literature of 
Europe during the three or four mediaeval centuries, 
and why it has been such a favorite theme from those 
days until now. The action is conceived on true dra- 
matic principles. There are no anti-climaxes, no 
superfluous lines, but all the incidents bear upon the 
development of the story and push it towards a con-

elusion which is both unexpected and thoroughly 
effective. It sweeps through a wide range of pas- 
sions ; love, jealousy, falsehood, revenge, a manly 
and heroic forgiveness, are deftly woven together 
and compel the interest from start to finish. Less 
satisfactory poetically than dramatically, it yet con- 
tains many fine passages, and the last scene between 
Arthur and Guinevere will even bear comparison 
with Tennyson's treatment of their parting. Guin- 
evere having called for a champion to do battle 
against Mordred, her accuser, Arthur, who is sup- 
posed to have been killed, enters with lowered helm. 
Disclosing himself to Mordred, they fight, and Ar- 
thur falls wounded to the earth. Guinevere re- 
enters, sees the face of Arthur, and falls at his feet, 
crying, " My lord ! my lord ! " 

Arth. Whose face -was there ? I pray you some one say, 

For all grows dark : I know not where I am.

UNIVERSITY CHANGES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The future development of our universities is a very 
fruitful subject, but I am surprised to see by your ar- 
ticle of Feb. 16 that you concur with the views of 
some of the Harvard faculty that it is likely to be after 
the English model. It is plain enough why Harvard 
men would incline to that idea. Eastern universities 
generally have not the democratic idea of education. 
Their endowments are never turned towards making 
education more accessible to the masses. In that re- 
spect there is already much similarity between some 
of our institutions and the English. It is as impos- 
sible for a poor American to go to Harvard or Yale 
without some kind of assistance as it is for a poor Eng- 
lishman to take his degree at Oxford or Cambridge with- 
out assistance. There is an evident purpose to make 
them exclusive. But there are many reasons why these 
ideas will not now become widely diffused. In the first 
place Harvard and Yale, while progressive along some 
lines, no longer set the pattern for the country. Our 
ideals have become, what they should be, cosmopolitan 
and democratic, that is, the ideals of the growing in- 
stitutions, which are in the West mostly, but some are 
also in the East. The state universities have generally 
but a nominal fee, and the great Leland Stanford Uni- 
versity, in California, has no fees. 

But you are right in assuming that we are on the eve of 
changes to meet changed conditions; we are, in fact, in 



the midst of such changes. The larger institutions are 
adding three years to the undergraduate courses leading 
up to the degree of Ph.D., and the A.B. is no longer the 
stopping place in academic life. The recitation system is 
almost antiquated in what is beginning to be known as 
the university proper. The lecture and seminary sys- 
tems are coming into universal vogue. These are the 
most characteristic changes of the time, and they are 
not after the English but the German model. If pres- 
ent developments continue, the time is not far distant 
when our universities will very closely correspond to the 
German type. It will only be when the graduate de- 
partments have grown to such size that what we are 
beginning to call the college part of the university may 
be completely segregated from it, as the preparatory 
departments have been segregated from our colleges. 

This development seems inevitable for a number of 
reasons. Great numbers of our professors are being and 
have been trained in Germany. But the principle rea- 
son is because Germany has both reached the highest 
scholarship yet attained and the most perfect facilities 
for imparting it. Her system is designed for mature, 
self-respecting men. The scholarly temper takes the 
place of the English boating, cricket, and horse-play. 

There seems to me to be more doubt about what form 
the future college will take than the university, 
whether it be large or small, and where it will leave off 
and the university begin. 

But our universities will have an opportunity to im- 
prove upon the German type. We may expect the secur- 
ity of tenure of professorial positions, and their grading 
into three ranks, something like the ordinary, extra- 
ordinary, and docent of the Germans, the salaries being 
supplemented by fees according to the number of stu- 
dents a professor may attract appointments always 
coming from the class below to the next higher. But we 
may improve upon their plan by making it easy for stu- 
dents to come. Free dormitories may be considered as 
legitimate a use for endowments as that for professorial 
chairs is considered now. The ideal of the greatest 
possible dissemination of higher education will be kept 
constantly in view, and the fact that universities are 
designed to serve society and not a class.

THE MOTHER'S INFLUENCE AS A FACTOR IN 

TEACHING POETICAL LITERATURE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I trust you will allow a mother to add a corollary to 
your discussion in respect to the best method of teach- 
ing literature, even if it is but an expression of individ- 
ual opinion. 

Bishop Spalding has said, " I have little hesitation in 
affirming that our home life, our social and political life, 
and our religious life have contributed far more to make 
us what we are than any and all of our schools," and 
with his words in our minds, it might be pertinent to 
inquire, What was the home life of the last generation, 
the generation which is responsible for our present home 
and social life ? Mr. Howells has recorded that in 
simpler days it was thought quite a proper thing for 
young men to read poetry to young women when they 
made an evening call, if they happened to be upon 
intimate terms with the family. To-day, a young man 
who would do such an unheard-of thing would be jeered 
at throughout his whole set. Yet I know that at least 
one-third of my early knowledge of the poets was un- 
consciously acquired in this pretty fashion. I was for-

tunate enough to have several masculine cousins some- 
what older than myself who led me in this wise to Shel- 
ley, Keats, Goethe, and Alfred de Musset. One of 
the accomplishments expected in those days of the edu- 
cated young man in New York City was the ability 
to read some quotations from his favorite poets with 
fair rhetorical effect. This training was due to the 
influence of the mothers, sisters, and wives. 

For some reason, I know not what, although the sexes 
are educated together, the old literary and musical sym- 
pathy between them which existed in the days just after 
the Civil War is gone. The average business man of 
to-day neither loves poetry nor music. His whole time 
and energy are absorbed in the accumulation of money. 
If he collects a library, it is largely composed of the 
gossip of the courts of the times of Charles II. and 
George IV., for the modern book-collector is a little 
too fond of gossip, and he admits the poets simply be- 
cause he is ashamed to leave them out. How much of 
this is due to the loss of mother-training at the fireside, 
and how much to worldly influences over which mothers 
and sisters hare no control, it is impossible to say. But 
so far as my personal knowledge goes, outside of the 
literati, the average woman of to-day is no more fond of 
poetry than the average man. But a few weeks since a 
woman-editor wrote me, " I cannot conceive of anyone 
buying a volume of poems simply for the pleasure of 
reading it." This remark shocked me, not so much as 
the expression of an individual opinion, for we have 
scores of writers among us who have no inherent taste 
for poetry, but because it voiced the great majority of 
women. On the other hand, the minority, headed by a 
few of our women poets, such as Mrs. Dorr in Vermont, 
Miss Ina D. Coolbrith in California, Miss Harriet Mon- 
roe and Mrs. Coonley in Chicago, are working tirelessly 
in the women's clubs to revive poetical taste. What a 
paradoxical age is ours! The era of women-poets and 
the era in which women, for the most part, have ceased 
to love and be inspired by poetry. 

Women read too much in their clubs about Dante, 
Shakespeare, and the Brownings, and devote too little 
attention to the words of the great masters. One club 
I know of in a small Western town, after studying for 
three weeks all that could be found in the one free 
library in respect to the man, Dante, concluded that the 
" Divine Comedy " and " The New Life " were a little 
bit too hard for them to " tackle," and went on to some- 
thing easier. 

If we would revive this lost poetical instinct and ap- 
preciation, we must take a few lessons from primitive 
times. It may be a myth that Alfred the Great re- 
ceived his first incitement to learning from his step- 
mother, or that Shakespeare's teacher in fairy lore was 
Mary Arden; but the stories illustrate the good old 
Saxon and Norman customs, which made the mother 
light the first spark of inspiration; and perhaps there 
could have been no Provencal literature if women had 
not invented, for the encouragement of poetical art, the 
" Courts of Love " where the Trouveur or Troubadour 
was encouraged to express his hidden thought in fault- 
less measure. 

Mothers can scarcely begin to instruct their children 
in merry jingles at too early an age. Many a restless 
baby will let a nurse handle him without crying if she 
will but babble the Mother Goose melodies. Mother 
Goose should be systematically followed up by the child- 
verses of, say, Eugene Field, Miss Edith M. Thomas, or 
Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge ; then the American and British 



poets, as the child's mind develops. Emerson's idea 
quoted in a recent number of THE DIAL (Feb. 16, 1896), 
" Would you inspire in a young man a taste for Chau- 
cer and Bacon ? Quote them," is the ideal method. 
The mother who can describe the Canterbury Pilgrims 
to her child, can relate the quaint tale of Palamon and 
Arcite, or the Clerk of Oxenford's story of the patient 
Griselda, has given her child a glimpse of Chaucer's time 
which the teacher might not be able to picture. Also 
some of the clean stories from Boccaccio can be told the 
child in the version found in Tennyson's " The Lover's 
Tale " or Keats's " Isabelle; or, the Pot of Basil." If to 
this were added the story of Petrarch's life, dwelling 
more upon his tastes as a bibliophile and expounder of the 
text of Cicero than upon the story of Laura, the three 
prominent literary figures of the fourteenth century 
would be indellibly stamped upon the child's mind years 
before it would be possible to send him to the volumes. 
When the mother allows the teacher to be the sole quick- 
ener of the child's imagination, part of the instinctive 
mother-love of the child is transferred to the teacher, as 
in the notable case of Lady Jane Grey. Yet I happen to 
know that the young teachers are doing very efficient 
work in the right direction in the public schools. In a 
family I know and love, a youngster of eight has for sup- 
plementary reading Longfellow's " Hiawatha." He can 
quote more of the verses upon Hiawatha's childhood 
than any other member of the family. Another boy 
acquired a love of Lowell in the public schools, but the 
eldest (the one who always has the greatest influence 
in forming the literary taste of a family), has passion- 
ately loved Shakespeare ever since his mother read with 
him the trial scene of the " Merchant of Venice," the 
first reading taking place when he was but ten years old. 

A Shakespeare quotation combat, to which might by 
added a small prize to the successful competitor; a famile 
reading in Plumptre's translation of Sophocles' " Anti- 
gone," or Euripides' " Iphigenia in Aulis," are not diffi- 
cult things for mothers to manage, and have an untold 
educational advantage. If these suggestions are scarcely 
feasible, what might a mother not accomplish with Sted- 
man's " Victorian Anthology " as a guide ? " The Land 
of Wonder- Wander "; the ballads; the fresh revelations 
of our time from the Dominion of Canada; Matthew 
Arnold's " Sohrab and Rustum " and " Balder Dead "; 
Edwin Arnold's poems, so attractive to the young; and 
Andrew Lang's fantastic ballades may all be found 
in this wonderful collection. 

If parents would allow their children to express their 
preferences for the poets (however crude) at the fam- 
ily board; with the idea that it does not make much dif- 
ference which side the young person takes in an argu- 
ment, so long as he has original ideas, and can clearly 
state the whys and wherefores of the faith that is in 
him, the young person would be tempted to read more. 
The American pater-familias, whatever his virtues else- 
where, is apt to be a stern, bigoted creature at home. 
He has very fixed ideas upon all sorts of subjects, and 
he does not like to be opposed in his own family. But 
the mother should hold her little courts with her chil- 
dren, if she would preserve the " inner light," to use 
the quaint Quaker phrase. I believe that the vestal vir- 
gins keeping watch over the sacred fires in the Roman 
temples, and Vesta's close association with the home as 
goddess of the hearth, were but symbols of the watch 
which women must ever keep over the sacred fire of 
poetry. MARY J. REID.

DANTE GABRIEL, ROSSETTI.* 



The biographical literature of the current 
year is not likely to include any work more fas- 
cinating in theme and richer in varied personal 
interest than the two handsome volumes con- 
taining severally a Memoir of Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti, by Mr. William Michael Rossetti, and 
a collection of the former's " Family-Letters." 
Mr. Rossetti's Life of his brother is a frank 
and rather discursive Boswellian record, pro- 
fuse of fact and sparing of disquisition, which 
may fairly be said to leave no reasonable ques- 
tion as to Dante Rossetti's career and person- 
ality unanswered. 

Gabriele Rossetti, father of Dante Gabriel 
and Christina Rossetti, was born at Vasto on 
the Adriatic coast of the then Kingdom of Na- 
ples, Feb. 28, 1783. Proscribed for Carbon- 
arism, he fled from Italy in 1821, and in 1824 
settled in London as a teacher of Italian, where 
he married a Miss Polidori, and in 1831 was 
appointed Professor of Italian in King's Col- 
lege. Gabriele Rossetti is described as a man 
of energetic and lively temper, sensitive to 
slight and quick to resent it, devoted to his 
family, a fervent apostle of Italian freedom and 
unity, and effusively grateful to those who had 
befriended him in his darker hour of exile. 
One of the author's most vivid memories is of 
the day when the death of his father's benefac- 
tor, John Hookham Frere, was announced : 
" With tears in his half-sightless eyes and the 
passionate fervor of a southern Italian, my 
father fell on his knees, and exclaimed, ' An- 
ima bella, benedetta sii tu, dovunque sei I ' 
(' Noble soul, blessed be thou wherever thou 
art ! ')" The Rossetti household was of Italian, 
not English, environment. The renown won 
by Gabriele in his own country as an Impro- 
visatore and writer of fervid political lyrics 
(" singable " is the term Carducci applied to 
his verses), followed him oversea; and the 
Charlotte Street home in London became a no- 
table rendezvous for his compatriots of all so- 
cial grades, from the titled refugee to the lib- 
eralized maccaroni-man and plaster-cast vendor 
waifs and strays, largely, cast up and stranded 
by the sea of expatriation. These picturesque 
quasi-political gatherings, to which all Italians, 
save the suspected spia (spy), were welcome,

were commonplace (rather tedious ones) in the 
lives of the young Rossettis. The special po- 
litical bete noire of the excitable guests was the 
French king, Louis Philippe or " Luigi Fil- 
ippo," as they called him. Says the author : 
" The number of times I have heard ' Luigi Filippo ' 
denounced would tax the resources of the Calculating 
Boy. My mind's eye presents a curious group, though, 
it seemed natural enough at the time. My father and 
three or four foreigners engaged in animated talk on 
the affairs of Europe, from the point of view of patriotic 
aspiration and hope deferred until it had become hope- 
less, with frequent recitations of poetry intervening; 
my mother, quiet but interested, and sometimes taking 
her mild womanly part in the conversation ; and we four 
children Maria more especially, with her dark Italian 
countenance and rapt eyes drinking it all in as a sort 
of necessary atmosphere of the daily life, yet with our 
own little interests and occupations as well reading, 
coloring prints, nursing the cat, or whatever came up- 
permost. . . . Gabriele Rossetti's noble declamation, 
taken along with his subject-matter, was indeed enough 
to carry any sympathizers away on the wave of excite- 
ment. His auditors hardly appeared to have any fleshly 
appetites. Such a thing as a solid supper was never in 
question, neither did they ever propose to smoke. They 
would come into our small sitting-room, greet the ' Sig- 
nora Francesca,' and sit down, as the chance offered, 
amid the whole family, adult and semi-infantine. A cup 
of tea or of coffee, with a slice of bread and butter, was 
all the provender wont to be forthcoming." 

The grand concern and magnum opus of the 
elder Rossetti was of course his Dante com- 
mentary (in which he proposed to show that the 
" Commedia " is chiefly political and anti-papal 
in its inner meaning); and at this task he was 
to be found daily grinding away, " surrounded 
by ponderous folios in italic type, * libri mys- 
tici,' and the like, often about alchemy, free- 
masonry, Brahminism, Swedenborg, the Ca- 
balla, etc." These labors were contemplated 
by the juniors with a certain awe not untinged 
with levity ; and our author notes that Dante 
Gabriel, so far from being, as fancifully stated, 
from childhood a lover of Dante, had not, up 
to the age of sixteen, read twenty consecutive 
lines of him. In fact, the abstruse turn of the 
father's Dantesque talk and labors bred in his 
children an a priori distaste for the mighty 
Alighieri, and even led them to regard him a 
a kind of household bogey second only in malign 
potency to " Luigi Filippo " himself. Says the 
author : 

" The Convito was always a name of dread to us, a* 
being the very essence of arid unreadableness. Dante 
Alighieri was a sort of banshee in the Charlotte Street 
house; his shriek audible even to familiarity, but the 
message of it not scrutinized." 

Gabriele Rossetti's four children were born 
in four successive years : Maria Francesca, in 
1827; Gabriel Charles Dante (Dante Gabriel, 



1896.]

he chose to style himself), in 1828 ; William 
Michael, in 1829 ; and Christina Georgina, in 
1830. In 1836 Dante Eossetti, then " a pleas- 
ing, spirited-looking boy, with bright eyes, au- 
burn hair, and fresh complexion," was sent to 
the day-school of a Mr. Paul, and thence, in 
1837, to King's College School, where he re- 
mained five years, gaining a fair knowledge of 
Latin and a smattering of Greek, and evincing 
a turn for drawing and rhyming that won him 
a degree of mild popularity, despite his " un- 
schoolboylike " ways and rather maidenly 
avoidance of the rough sports and Homeric bat- 
tles of his schoolmates. 

Mr. Rossetti notes that he cannot remember 
any date at which it was not understood in the 
family that " Gabriel meant to be a painter "; 
and so in 1842, on leaving school, he at once 
entered the drawing academy of Mr. F. S. Gary, 
where he remained till 1846, drawing from the 
antique, dabbling a little in anatomy, and, as 
always, following mainly his own bent and 
fancy. " He liked to do what he himself chose, 
and, even if he did what someone else pre- 
scribed, he liked to do that in his own way." 
Prom Gary's, Rossetti went to the Royal Acad- 
emy School ; and here, as before, he went on 
working with much enthusiasm as to the main 
nd, and with equal laxity as to the prescribed 
means. Holman Hunt has left a graphic sketch 
of him as an Academy student : 

" A young man of decidedly foreign aspect, with long 
brown hair touching his shoulders, not taking care to 
walk erect, but rolling carelessly as he slouched along,* 
pouting with parted lips, staring with dreaming eyes. 
. . . He was careless in his dress. So superior was he 
to the ordinary vanities of young men that he would 
allow the spots of mud to remain dry on his legs for 
several days. . . . With his pushing stride and loud 
voice, a special scrutiny would have been needed to dis- 
cern the reserved tenderness that dwelt in the breast of 
the apparently careless and defiant youth. ... In these 
early days, with all his headstrongness and a certain 
want of consideration, his life within was untainted to 
an exemplary degree, and he worthily rejoiced in the 
poetic atmosphere of the sacred and spiritual dreams 
that encircled him, however some of his noisy demon- 
strations at the time might hinder this from being rec- 
ognized by a hasty judgment." 

In 1848, Rossetti entered the studio of Mr. 
Ford Madox Brown, whose somewhat abstruse 
canvases he greatly admired. It is related that 
he had previously penned a note to Brown 
(asking to be received as a pupil) so lavish of 
praise that the recipient, believing himself 
twitted, seized a stout stick and set out to chas- 
tise the unknown joker. Arrived at Rossetti's

about, and behaving like a seal on a sandbank." 



room and finding the occupant within, he asked 
fiercely, " Is your name Rossetti, and is this 
your writing ? " An affirmative reply was fol- 
lowed by, " What do you mean by it ? " To 
this the startled Rossetti mildly answered that 
he " meant precisely what he had said," where- 
upon the touchy painter, seeing his error, 
warmly granted his admirer's request, taking 
him as a pupil gratis, and thus founding an 
intimacy that led up to the companionship with 
Holman Hunt and Millais, and so to the fa- 
mous Praeraphaelite Brotherhood, of which, 
however, Madox Brown was never a member. 
Of this much- canvassed coterie the author gives 
an interesting account ; but we shall only note 
in passing that Dante Rossetti, after the fervor 
of youth was past, wearied exceedingly of the 
P. R. B., and was disposed to resent any allusion 
to it. In 1880 he said to Mr. Hall Caine, " As 
for all the prattle about Praeraphaelitism, I con- 
fess to you I am weary of it, and long have been. 
Why should we go on talking about the vision- 
ary vanities of half-a-dozen boys ? What you 
call the movement was serious enough, but the 
banding together under that title was all a 
joke." To a lady who asked him if he were 
"the Prseraphaelite Rossetti," he replied curtly, 
" Madame, I am not an ' ite ' of any kind ; I 
am only a painter." Rossetti's first exhibited 
picture was " The Girlhood of Mary Virgin " 
(signed " Dante Gabriel Rossetti, P. R. B."), 
which he sent to the Free Exhibition in 1849. 
The work was well received by the critics (the 
storm against Prseraphaelitism began in the 
following year), and was promptly sold at the 
painter's own price of ,80. 

Turning to our author's account of the liter- 
ary side of Rossetti's career, we find that his 
first printed poem was " Sir Hugh the Heron," 
a boyish attempt imitative of Scott, begun when 
the author was twelve, and printed two years 
later at his grandfather Polidori's private press. 
In 1861 appeared his unsurpassed translations 
from " The Early Italian Poets." In 1867 he 
was attacked by insomnia, accompanied by par- 
tial failure of eyesight. Disabled thus from 
the practice of one art, he turned his thoughts 
more exclusively to the other ; and his former 
vague project of one day issuing a volume of 
poems quickly took shape. Those familiar with 
Rossetti's life will recall a romantic incident 
connected with the preparation of this volume. 
His wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, 
died in 1862, after two years of wedded life. 
This loss seemed to the stricken painter to cover 
life with a funeral pall ; and in his early trans-

ports of despair he went into the room where 
his dead wife lay, and placed his cherished book 
of MS. poems in her coffin putting, says Mr. 
Hall Caine, " the volume between her cheek and 
beautiful hair, and it was that day buried with 
her in Highgate Cemetery." " I have often," 
he said, " been writing at those poems when 
Lizzie was ill and suffering, and I might have 
been attending to her, and now they shall go." 
In 1869 he yielded to his friends' solicitations 
that his wife's coffin be exhumed, and the MS. 
recovered. This was done on October 10 ; and 
he was thus again put in possession of the cor- 
rect form of his old poems, and also of some 
pieces of which he had retained no fragments. 
The volume was published on April 25, 1870 ; 
and the chorus of praise for it was " eager, 
loud, and prolonged." But there was presently 
a bitterly dissentient voice. In the " Contem- 
porary Review " for October, 1871, appeared 
an abusive article headed " The Fleshly School 
of Poetry Mr. D. G. Rossetti," and signed 
" Thomas Maitland " " Maitland " soon prov- 
ing to be Mr. Robert Buchanan. As Mr. Ros- 
setti lays great stress on this deplorable epi- 
sode, owing to its averred serious effect on his 
brother, we shall briefly review his version of it. 
The animus of the " Maitland " article is, he 
states, primarily traceable to a review he himself 
had written in 1866. It was in that year that 
Mr. Buchanan's burlesque poem, " The Session 
of the Poets," appeared in the " Spectator," 
following the issue of Mr. Swinburne's " Poems 
and Ballads." It contained these lines : 

" Up jumped, with his neck stretching out like a gander, 

Master Swinburne, and squealed, glaring out through his hair, 

' All virtue is bosh 1 Hallelujah for Landor ! 

I disbelieve wholly in everything ! There 1 ' 

With language so awful he dared then to treat 'em, 

Miss Ingelow faulted in Tennyson's arms ; 

Poor Arnold rushed out, crying ' Saed ' inficetum ! ' 

And great bards and small bards were full of alarms : 

Till Tennyson, flaming and red as a gipsy, 

Struck his fist on the table, and uttered a shout : 

4 To the door with the boy ! Call a cab I He is tipsy ! ' 

And they carried the naughty young gentleman out." 

At about this time Mr. William Rossetti was 
writing a review of Mr. Swinburne's book ; and 
the above lines moved him to open his critique 
as follows : 

" The advent of a great poet is sure to cause a com- 
motion of one kind or another; and it would be hard 
were this otherwise in times like ours, when the advent 
of even so poor and pretentious a poetaster as a Robert 
Buchanan stirs storms in teapots." 

So scored, Mr. Buchanan soon found occasion 
to " pitch into " an edition of Shelley prepared 
by his assailant, amiably affirming it to be " the 
very worst edition of Shelley which has ever 



seen the light "; and thus was the battle joined. 
Rossetti was not much cast down, it seems, 
by the " Maitland " article ; but it was far 
otherwise when this piece reappeared (1872) 
much enlarged and trebly charged with venom, 
in a pamphlet volume entitled " The Fleshly 
School of Poetry, and other Phenomena of the 
Day, by Robert Buchanan." As to Rossetti's 
Poems, the pamphlet avers : 

". . . There is thorough nastiness in many pieces. 
A sickening desire is evinced to reproduce the sensual 
mood. Rossetti has not given us one rounded and note- 
worthy piece of art. He is fleshly all over, from the 
roots of his hair to the tips of his toes. Bad rhymea 
become the rule, and not the exception. . . . Sonnets 
11 to 20 are one profuse sweat of animalism. < The 
House of Life ' is a very hotbed of nasty phrases. . . . 
In Rossetti's poetry there is a veritably stupendous pre- 
ponderance of sensuality and sickly animalism. He and 
Mr. Swinburne merely echo what is vile " etc. 

It may be charitably assumed that the writer 
of this precious " appreciation " was not aware 
when he wrote it that many of the compositions 
which he thus characterized as deliberate and 
unredeemed filth had once been placed by their 
author as a pious sacrifice in his dead wife's 
coffin. When the pamphlet appeared Rossetti 
was in a distressing state, mentally and bodily, 
partly from insomnia, but chiefly through over- 
dosing with chloral. He had resorted to the 
drug as a soporific in 1870 ; and from eighteen 
grains nightly, he had rapidly increased his 
allowance to 180 grains ! Mr. Gosse states 
that " no case has been recorded in the annals 
of medicine in which one patient has taken so 
much, or even half so much, chloral as Rossetti 
took." Thus, domestic grief and the strain of 
a restless, teeming imagination had brought on 
insomnia ; insomnia had led to chloral ; and 
chloral to depression, with a turmoil of distem- 
pered fears and fantasies. When Mr. Bu- 
chanan's pamphlet appeared, Rossetti was on 
the verge of mental collapse ; and this unhappy 
screed seems to have finished the work. His 
fancies, says the author, " now ran away with 
him, and he thought the pamphlet was a first 
symptom in a widespread ' conspiracy ' for 
crushing his fair fame as an artist and a man, 
and for hounding him out of honest society." 
His manifold delusions were thenceforth tinged 
with this notion. Having received, for instance, 
from Mr. Browning a copy of his " Fifine at 
the Fair," he at once fastened upon some lines 
at the end as being a spiteful attack upon him- 
self ; and Mr. Browning was thereupon set 
down as a leading member of the " conspiracy." 
Rossetti was never able to quite rid himself of

this fancy. To Mr. Browning was soon joined, 
as a fellow-conspirator, Mr. Dodgson, whose 
wildly absurd nonsense-poem, " The Hunting 
of the Snark," the unhappy man declared to be 
a pasquinade against himself. Another delu- 
sion may be recorded, if only as a curiosity in 
mental pathology. While staying at Broad- 
lands, a friend's seat in Hampshire, Rossetti 
one day became angered at a thrush which 
trilled its lay in an adjoining garden, conceiv- 
ing that the bird had been trained by the con- 
spirers against his peace " to ejaculate some- 
thing insulting to him " ! Rossetti's illness 
culminated in the attempt at suicide (at the 
house of a Dr. Hake) to which Mr. Bell Scott 
has vaguely alluded, and of which the author, 
" rather than leave the matter open to dubious 
conjecture," gives a frankly detailed account, 
saying that his brother's despair impelled him 
finally to swallow the contents of a bottle of 
laudanum. " Of course his intention was sui- 
cide." 

Mr. Rossetti, as we have seen, inclines to 
view the Buchanan attack upon his brother as 
contributing largely to his mental upset ; and 
his tone throughout the chapter treating of the 
matter (even where he mentions Mr. Buchan- 
an's final retraction) is charged with bitterness. 
" It is," he avers, " a simple fact, that from 
the time when the pamphlet had begun to work 
into the inner tissue of his feelings, Dante Ros- 
setti was a changed man, and so continued till 
the close of his life." It seems clear that the 
pamphlet, appearing when it did, inflamed Ros- 
setti's malady, and determined the peculiar 
drift of his hallucinations ; but we must con- 
clude, on our author's own showing, that had 
Mr. Buchanan never written of the " Fleshly 
School," insomnia and chloral, acting upon so 
sensitive and delicately balanced an organism, 
must have wrought approximately as they did. 

Mr. Rossetti's narrative is a little jumbled, 
but it is eminently candid, and full of telling 
color and detail. It sets before us most vividly 
the true Dante Rossetti a widely different 
figure, let us add, from the affected, fantastic 
Rossetti, half coxcomb, half mystic, as painted 
by the popular fancy. The letters are famil- 
iar, rather off-hand compositions, valuable 
mainly as reflecting the personality of the 
writer. The volumes form a desirable memo- 
rial of that rare genius whose distinction it is 
to have furnished his time with new and worthy 
pictorial and poetical ideals, and to have left 
the world appreciably richer in two arts.

THE PARIS COMMUNE OF 1871.* 

The Commune of 1871 can never impress 
our imagination as does her terrible elder sis- 
ter of '89. The events are perhaps too near 
us and the personal insignificance and selfish 
pusillanimity of the chief actors stand out too 
clearly in the pitiless glare of modern publicity. 
Moreover, the Revolution was a justified revolt 
against an organized system of political oppres- 
sion and caste privilege, and amid all its ex- 
travagances and atrocities pursued a definite 
policy to a successful result. The leaders of 
the Commune never made it quite clear to them- 
selves, their adherents, or the world, whether 
they were contending for municipal autonomy, 
for the social revolution, or for the temporary 
command of the luxuries of Paris. And the 
vague social distress and discontent which found 
vent through them is a phenomenon concern- 
ing the causes, the justification, and the possi- 
ble cure of which we are still in the dark. 
Their sole contribution to the problem has been 
to strengthen the deep distrust with which so- 
ber men regard any attempts at reform that 
begin by weakening the restraints which the 
present organization of society enforces upon 
the brute beast within the man. 

But though the higher historical imagina- 
tion is not deeply stirred, there is a certain hor- 
rible fascination in reading of events like these 
taking place, not in the dimly conceived pre- 
Haussmannic Paris, but in the streets and 
squares of that very capital of pleasure and 
happy hunting-ground of the Cook's tourist that 
we know so well how the Place de la Con- 
corde shelled the Arc de Triomphe, and the 
Arc de Triomphe swept with grape-shot the 
Champs Elysees, how fiends in the shape of 
women fired the Rue Royale with petroleum, 
how the dead lay in heaps on the floor of La 
Madeleine, while the Louvre was encircled with 
a cordon of fire, and frenzied horsemen gal- 
loped from the fortress of the Hotel de Ville to 
the armed camp in the Place Vendome with 
orders to " blow up everything." It is as hard 
for us to realize as it was for the dazed French 
trooper whom Ludovic Halevy in his amusing 
reminiscences speaks of meeting at the gates of 
the city, and who to all inquiries could only 
reply breathlessly : " It 's jess paralyzin' in 
Paris barricades all over the place, and bombs, 
and gun-shots, and pistols going off, it 's jess 
paralyzin', even if nothin' hits you."

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



This story has just been told by Mr. Thomas 
March in his " History of the Paris Commune 
of 1871." The book is a somewhat amateur- 
ish performance, but merits attention as the 
first attempt in English to present a systematic 
impartial narration of these events based on a 
study of the sources. Mr. March cites as his 
authorities, and conscientiously uses, the offi- 
cial reports of the French Commission of En- 
qifiry, the military report of Marshall Mac- 
Mahon, the proceedings of the Conseils de 
Guerre and a number of other minor French 
treatises apologetic or explanatory. But his 
main reliance has evidently been the classical 
work of Maxime du Camp " Les Convulsions 
de Paris," first published in the form of arti- 
cles in the "Revue des Deux Mondes." A 
brief introductory chapter sketches the rise of 
the International and the fomentation of rad- 
ical sentiment by the repressive regime and the 
injustices of the Third Empire. The narration 
proper begins with the arrival of the news of 
the Capitulation of Sedan, and the consequent 
deposition of the Emperor by an infuriated 
Parisian mob on the 4th of September. Three 
or four chapters are devoted to the history of 
the siege, including a full description of the 
unsuccessful attempt of the revolutionary party 
on the 31st of October to oust the Government 
of National Defence from the Hotel de Ville. 
We are then shown the gradual growth and 
consolidation of this party, the federation of 
the national guards, the organization of the 
Central Committee, the daily increasing popu- 
lar distrust and discontent, and the final exas- 
peration of the populace by the terms of the 
truce and the German occupation of the Champs 
Elysees. Only a spark was needed to ignite 
this inflammable material. It was struck from 
a collision of the mob with the forces of the 
government in a blundering attempt of the lat- 
ter to seize the cannon which the guards had 
dragged up to Montmartre for fear that Thiers 
would abandon them to Bismarck. The failure 
of this attempt, and the consequent withdrawal 
of Thiers to Versailles, delivered Paris over to 
the revolutionary leaders, somewhat to their 
own surprise and embarrassment. Of their 
rule, or misrule, from March 18 to May 21, 
when the reorganized army of Versailles reen- 
tered the city, Mr. March gives a full, clear, 
and impartial account. It would not be easy 
to lend artistic unity to this part of the story. 
For among these improvised rulers no man and 
no party possessing a definite policy exercised 
effective predominancy ; and so the narration 



of their actions breaks up into a fragmentary 
history of committees, departments, and the 
sterile agitations of individual greed or ambi- 
tion. Any member of the Commune who could 
get control of one of the great departmental 
buildings was practically master there, unless 
he interfered overmuch with his colleagues, or 
seemed to be compromising the safety of the 
whole. The ultimate test of a man's influence 
was his power of " bluff," or perhaps rather 
the number of federated battalions that it was 
believed would rise at his bidding. 

Mr. March confines himself to a plain nar- 
rative of the military operations, if they may 
be so called, and the legislative action of the 
Commune. He would have made a far more 
readable book if he had availed himself more 
freely of the stores of interesting anecdote and 
amusing character-sketches accessible in Max- 
ime du Camp and his other sources. Of the 
real aims and motives of the more serious- 
minded among the leaders, of their justification 
in their own eyes, he tells us little, and his por- 
traits of their characters are slight and not 
always discriminating. He recognizes the es- 
sential integrity of purpose of Delescluze and 
Varlin, whom he calls, " in honor, modesty, and 
sincerity the noblest ... of the entire Com- 
mune." He does more than justice to that con- 
temptible dandified bully, Raoul Rigault, when 
he pronounces him " the one strong-willed man 
of the Commune," and perhaps something less 
than justice to Jourde, who probably saved the 
Bank of France, and who at any rate handled 
millions without a suspicion attaching to his 
honesty. 

The most readable part of the book is the full 
vivid description in the last hundred pages of 
the terrible eight days of fighting in the streets, 
which gradually strained the nerves of the 
soldiers as well as of the insurgents to the point 
where men become more or less than men, and 
culminated in wholesale cold-blooded butchery 
on both sides. A brief conclusion sketches 
the dealings of the French courts with the 36,- 
000 prisoners taken, and the fate of some of 
the prominent leaders of the movement. The 
author's style, though straightforward and not 
unpleasant, is unformed and at times incorrect. 
He abuses the historic present a form of vi- 
vacity in which only a Carlyle may safely in- 
dulge and now and then relieves his emotions 
by naive apostrophes and ejaculatory moraliz- 
ings, such as : " Alarmed, no ! disgusted and 
humiliated," " Take heed, ye men of strong per- 
suasions ! " " Speed ye, Versaillais, if ye would

save your idolized city from a frightful calam- 
ity." There is a more than Thucydidean license 
of anacoluthon in the syntax of " and Paris 
was shut in upon herself for a few days only 
partially but presently to be absolute." And 
what Mr. March would call an " undisciplin- 
ary " imagination expresses itself in such met- 
aphors as : " The hot-headed youthdom which 
studies in Paris and becomes the feeding-trough 
of successive revolutions," or " the Commune 
borne into existence by a current of supposed 
patriotism which was only a cloak" etc. And 
in addition to these oddities of expression, the 
reader's attention is now and then startled by 
such freaks or monstrosities as : " inflamma- 
gent," " infuriated simples," " arson as a prin- 
ciple of practiques," " light-souled bouncers," 
" Rigault's body was lain beside a barricade," 
" punctilious for his own safety," " la deche- 
anse " [#ic], "a motley and disorderly parapher- 
nalia." General ideas and illuminating phil- 
osophic criticism are wanting, unless we can 
accept as such the sapient observation that 
" hasty retributions are swift and often irre- 
mediable iniquities," or the aphorism "the 
intolerance of one sect is and ever shall be com- 
pensated by that of another," or the apocalyp- 
tic final utterance that " only the dumb have 
a universal language, and only the outcasts 
actual or prospective of society can own a uni- 
versal republic." 

Perhaps no very definite lesson can as yet 
be derived from this casual outburst of the ap- 
petites and envies that are always seething be- 
neath the thin crust of civilization. We can 
see that, even apart from the peculiar conditions 
created by the siege, Paris was the predestined 
theatre of this uprising. For Paris is the one 
city in which the pleasures of Vhomme sensuel 
moyen are most persistently and tantalizingly 
dangled before the eyes of the disinherited. 
And there is no other city in which a little 
money is so easily and obviously convertible 
into those pleasures as Paris. I mean that the 
poor devil in the street of Paris has a much 
more vivid conception of what it would be like 
to descend from his garret to a first floor apart- 
ment, to sip his absinthe at the Cafe Eiche, dine 
at the Cafe Anglais, and enjoy the other de- 
lights obtruded upon his notice by the capital 
of pleasure, than his Chicago counterpart can 
possibly have of the discreet and sheltered lux- 
ury of a home on the Lake Shore Drive or on 
Prairie Avenue. He would know better how 
to transmute a purse of money into the pleas- 
ures he covets. And frequent revolutions have 



familiarized him with the idea that the shortest 
way to this consummation is the seizure of po- 
litical power. This reflection will not explain 
the action of the few honest fanatics of the 
Commune, but it contains the entire " psychol- 
ogy " of a majority of its " colonels " and 
" generals " and minor officials. The chief 
lesson of the miserable story for the student 
of history after the obvious warning that our 
civilization is only skin deep is the ruinous 
folly of procrastination, of half measures, of 
drifting with the tide in matters that con- 
cern the passions of the unthinking masses of 
men. Neither the revolutionary nor the gov- 
ernmental leaders intended or foresaw in the 
beginning the horrors of the final week. But 
both, while playing with the passions of their 
supporters, allowed affairs to drift until con- 
cession and retreat were impossible. A series 
of blunders and untoward accidents intensified 
the exasperation of the combatants on either 
side, and so, to apply a phrase of Mr. Raskin, 
they saw " The resolved arbitration of the des- 
tinies conclude into precision of doom what 
they blindly and feebly began."

ANGLICAN AND CATHOLIC.* 



Mr. Saintsbury recently said that Cardinal 
Manning " was less a man of letters than a 
very astute man of business." But Manning 
was much more than even a very astute man 
of business, because just as surely as his con- 
sumate diplomacy in ecclesiastical affairs rose 
at times to the dignity of statesmanship was 
Manning a great ecclesiastical statesman. His 
life was, indeed, so complete that he once inti- 
mated it would require at least three biogra- 
phers to write it adequately : " an Oxford man 
for the first period ; a priest for dogmas and 
councils and diocesan business (though I doubt 
if the same one could do the Roman part and 
the Westminster part); and for the political 
and social questions of my latter days a third, 
' in rebus vitce publicce apprime versatus.' '' 

If Mr. Pur cell, therefore, in his new " Life 
of Cardinal Manning," was called upon to per- 
form the work of three men, he was, on the 
other hand, given an abundance of material 
sufficient for at least three ordinary biographies.

tobiographical notes, and a multitude of letters, 
he had constant opportunities of learning from 
Cardinal Manning himself the story of his life 
and the motives of his action. Mr. Gladstone, 
than whom no one was more intimately asso- 
ciated with Manning in his Anglican days, was 
also an inspiring source of information. This 
invaluable material (and it should be added 
that in his private diaries the Cardinal had 
revealed the inner workings of his mind with 
unusual clearness) Mr. Purcell has used with 
utmost liberality, allowing Cardinal Manning 
to relate, in so far as was possible, his own life 
in his own words. 

The truth is, Mr. Purcell has been generous 
with his material to the point of indiscretion, 
and, not content with this, he has lingered over 
the weaknesses of his hero, while he does not 
seem to have emphasized his greatnesses. But 
if this be undeniable, it is just as undeniable 
that Mr. Purcell's book throws a flood of light 
on matters of importance hitherto hidden in 
obscurity. 

One of these is the conversion of Archdea- 
con Manning to Catholicism. It has always 
been supposed that Manning seceded from the 
English Church because of the acceptance by 
that church of royal supremacy on doctrinal 
matters, resulting from the decision in March, 
1850, which permitted its priests to deny the 
doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration. But the 
extracts from Manning's diary, and from his 
letters to Charles Laprimaudaye and Robert 
Wilberforce, prove beyond a doubt that as 
early as May, 1846, he had intellectually broken 
from the Anglican Church, although there is 
not a trace of this rupture in his public utter- 
ances until after the Gorham Judgment. Af- 
flicted all these years by conflicting claims of 
conscience, his faith in the Catholic Church 
steadily increasing, Manning still preached 
with as much apparent assurance and author- 
ity as ever. The only explanation of this seem- 
ing duplicity lies in what Cardinal Vaughan, 
the present Archbishop of Westminster, has 
said about Manning. " Those who knew the 
Cardinal well," he observes, "knew that he 
had two moods of character. One of great cau- 
tion and self-restraint when he spoke or wrote 
in public. Measure and prudence were then 
dictated by a high sense of responsibility. An- 
other, of singular freedom and playfulness of 
speech, when he thoroughly unbent with those 
whom he trusted in private." Mr. Purcell fur- 
thermore suggests : 

" Manning had, to put it broadly, two sets of people 



to deal with: the one set, those who put their trust in 
him the ecclesiastical authorities and his own peni- 
tents; the other set, those in whom he put his trust 
his intimate friends and confessors. He dealt with each 
set from different standpoints: from the one he consid- 
ered it his duty to conceal his religious doubts aud dif- 
ficulties; to the other he laid bare, as in conscience 
bound, the secrets of his soul." 

Although Mr. Gladstone belonged to the 
former of these sets, there existed between the 
statesman and the churchman a very ardent 
friendship. Until Manning's conversion they 
were, according to Mr. Gladstone's own ac- 
count, " in close and constant communication"; 
in many of the battles of belief they fought 
side by side. In 1838 they were together in 
Rome. 

" Ask Gladstone,' the Cardinal once said, ' whether 
he remembers standing side by side with me in the 
Church of 8. Luigi dei Francesi, listening to the sermon 
of a Dominican friar, and saying to me, ' Such preachers 
we want at home eloquent and impassioned, yet sin- 
gularly dogmatic in their teachings.' This incident Mr. 
Gladstone remembered well. ' Ask the Cardinal,' he 
said in retort, ' if he remembers how, when we were 
walking together one Sunday morning in the Piazza dei 
Fiore, he rebuked me for buying apples on a Sunday. 
The Cardinal Archbishop,' he added with a smile, ' is, 
I fancy, far more tolerant than the straitlaced parson 
of that day.' " 

After Manning was received into the Catholic 
Church in 1851 he and Gladstone did not meet 
for twelve years ; their interrupted correspond- 
ence was then renewed, but it was without the 
warmth that marked their early friendship. 

However, the friendship between Gladstone 
and Manning was much more sincere and last- 
ing than that between Newman and Manning. 
Between these men a mutual mistrust seems to 
have arisen after Manning, who at no time was 
very strongly influenced by the Oxford Move- 
ment, and had, indeed, withdrawn from the 
Movement upon becoming Archdeacon of Chi- 
chester, attacked the Tracterians in his Fifth 
of November Sermon, 1843. This distressing 
mistrust was never overcome on the part of 
either, and a conciliatory correspondence begun 
in 1867 resulted in each expressing the not un- 
humorous resolution of saying a series of masses 
for the friendly intentions of the other. Two 
years later Newman wrote to Manning : " I do 
not know whether I am on my head or my heels 
when I have active relations with you." After 
they became cardinals they met but twice. Yet 
such is the eloquent complexity of man's char- 
acter that at Cardinal Newman's death Man- 
ning spoke of him as his " brother and friend 
of more than sixty years " ! 

As a churchman Manning's work was three-

fold, that of the author, of the preacher, and 
of the spiritual guide. As an author, his style 
was sometimes obscure, seldom distinctive, al- 
ways unpolished. He was not an original 
thinker, nor a profoundly read theologian ; he 
was not logical enough to be a successful con- 
troversialist, nor imaginative enough to pro- 
duce literature of lasting merit. As a pulpit 
orator, a clear penetrating voice added to a dig- 
nified and impressive manner. But with Man- 
ning, even more than with Matthew Arnold, 
conscience was three-fourths of life, and the 
rules of conduct which he prescribed as a spir- 
itual guide were often extremely rigorous. In 
the fulness of his piety he thought more of the 
spirit than of beauty. 

In the larger sphere of public action Man- 
ning was, with his tact, his diplomatic skill, his 
persuasive and conciliatory manners, and his 
great tenacity of purpose, everywhere so emi- 
nently successful, that he was once likened to 
" a pawn on the ecclesiastical chessboard, push- 
ing his way through hostile lines to the goal of 
his desires." If his methods were sometimes 
open to criticism, as in the Errington case (upon 
which Mr. Purcell dwells much too minutely _), 
his conduct was always inspired by pure and 
exalted motives. His most brilliant honors as 
an ecclesiastical statesman were won as a Father 
of the Vatican Council, where, turning aside 
all opposition, he brought about the definition 
of Papal Infallibility. The meeting of the 
Vatican Council at which this definition was 
carried is vividly described by Mr. Purcell : 

On Monday the 18th of July, 1870 [the Vatican 
Council] held its fourth and last public session. The 
excitement was intense. The moral as well as the ma- 
terial atmosphere was charged with electricity. Men 
to whom the Faith of the Church was as a breath to their 
nostrils stood in that hour trembling on the verge of 
future events, they knew not what revolt, schism, 
apostacy, perhaps the fall, if not of nations and peoples, 
as the prophets of ill had predicted, of individuals, 
bishops, priests, and even whole communities. The 
thunder-storm, the lightnings from Heaven which burst 
over the Vatican, as the Council received and ratified 
the Papal Decree, was but a pale reflex or faint whisper 
of the moral storm which agitated the hearts of men, 
and shook for a time from their balance the minds of 
but too many. The more subdued the excitement, the 
more intense. The white-mitred Fathers of the Coun- 
cil, as they took part in the last scene of the moving 
drama, were subdued into a silence by a feeling akin 
to awe. Manning was, perhaps, the most silent; but, 
as an eye-witness related, his face was flushed with ex- 
citement and transfigured with an indescribable look 
of triumph at the unanimity with which the Council, in 
obedience to the Divine Will, ratified, as he had pre- 
dicted, the dogma of Papal Infallibility. ... On the 
day after the Definition Tuesday, 19th of July 
War was declared between France and Germany. And 



War, the great proroguer of Councils, prorogued the 
Vatican Council for an indefinite period." 

Unfortunately, all the chapters of Mr. Pur- 
cell's work do not show the really masterful 
treatment of that from which I have just quoted. 
The value of the work is seriously marred by 
an unusual quantity of misprints and oversights, 
and by mistakes in matters of fact which might 
have been remedied by a careful revision. Mr. 
Purcell, moreover, has shown little skill in the 
treatment of his material, and almost no sense 
of proportion. There are many needless repe- 
titions. Further than this, Mr. Purcell is un- 
justly severe with his hero, and frequently im- 
putes to Cardinal Manning motives utterly 
unworthy of so good and great a man.

RECENT BIBLICAL, CRITICISM.* 

American interest in matters of Biblical criticism, 
instead of waning, is constantly growing. The the- 
ories of German scholars have not merely become 
known to technical students, but they are perme- 
ating also the atmosphere of popular knowledge. 
Books are being prepared which the ordinarily in- 
telligent person can read with profit, and which will 
enable him to thread his way through the somewhat 
devious paths of the Higher Criticism with clearer 
view and surer step. As a result, some clearly de- 
fined attitudes on the part of a larger company than 
that of the scholars are easily discernible. There 
is, first of all, a small number of those who have ac- 
cepted, without much study, the most radical conclu- 
sions of the most radical of German scholars. These 
are for the most part clergymen who are proud to 
be numbered among the favorers of all new things, 
who have accepted these views, not because they 
have become convinced by careful study that here 
is the only safe ground, but because these theories 
are destructive of much that has been for a long 
time accepted among us. At the other extreme 
stands the class of rigidly orthodox persons, who 
are equally ignorant with the former class of the real 
facts in the case, but who are always against any- 
thing that is new. Between these are several other 
classes standing at varying distances from one or 
the other. There are those who, having examined

in some degree these topics and perceiving their 
extreme difficulty, are inclined to leave the matter 
alone until more definite conclusions have been 
reached. Some, having given careful study to the 
subject, feel that the orthodox position has not been 
seriously disturbed ; others recognize that new points 
of view must be taken, but are not prepared to take 
them. There are still others who hold that the re- 
sults of Biblical criticism, while affecting the out- 
ward form of the Biblical revelation, have not at 
all changed the essential truth of it. They either 
reduce the discredited material to moral teaching 
through symbolism, or hold faith and science strictly 
apart from one another. 

Meanwhile, the field is being cleared somewhat 
by the examination of fundamental principles. A 
little book by Professor A. C. Zenos, entitled " The 
Elements of the Higher Criticism," is of exceeding 
value in this respect. With steady judicial balance 
the true meaning and proper methods of the Higher 
Criticism are set forth, as well as the relation of 
this science to other associated sciences, and the 
dangers that threaten the scholar in his employ- 
ment of this instrument. The book is a model of 
clearness, and, coming as it does from one who is 
recognized as belonging to the conservative wing of 
the Presbyterian church, will be of great influence 
in opening the eyes and clarifying the judgment of 
those who are associated with that party, while it 
is of real service to their opponents to have pointed 
out to them in so reasonable a manner the difficul- 
ties and extravagances into which one may fall by 
an unwarranted use of the Higher Criticism. It is 
interesting to notice that Professor Zenos draws all 
his illustrations of the methods of Higher Criticism 
from its abuses. One reading his book would be 
inclined to think that the higher critics have been 
constantly making mistakes, and that the method 
has accomplished little or nothing. We can under- 
stand the hindrances under which Professor Zenos 
labored, and, on the whole, think him eminently 
wise in the cautious way in which he has proceeded. 
It would be of inestimable benefit to any intelligent 
student of the Bible to read and digest this clear 
and valuable manual. 

Professor William Henry Green is recognized as 
the champion of the conservative school in Biblical 
study, and from no other writings can one gain so 
clear an understanding of the merits and the de- 
fects of this school than from his two books now 
before us. In " The Higher Criticism of the Pen- 
tateuch " he has set forth the general principles 
which should govern any proper study of this por- 
tion of the Old Testament and his criticisms of the 
methods and results of the progressive school. He 
starts with the acceptance of the unity of the Bible, 
and has here done excellent service in bringing for- 
ward an often forgotten fact, namely, that the Bible, 
as it stands, has a single message, an organized 
character. But it seems to us that the conclusion 
which he has drawn from this important fact, 
namely, that therefore there is presumptive evidence 



that the Bible was originally a unity in all its parts, 
cannot but be regarded as unwarrantable. His 
whole discussion is vitiated by this begging of the 
question ; and, indeed, we find it difficult to follow 
him, since he is constantly making those assump- 
tions which should not precede, but follow, a study 
of the material itself. The question, e.g., in what 
respect the Bible is the Word of God, is answered 
in the Bible itself, by a study of its own statements 
and contents ; one particular theory on this point 
cannot be accepted beforehand and made the basis 
of argument. 

In his second work, "The Unity of the Book of 
Genesis," Dr. Green has done some most excellent 
service by testing in detail the hypotheses of the ad- 
vanced critics concerning the formation of the Book 
of Genesis. The volume is not one suited for pop- 
ular reading, but demands a knowledge of Hebrew. 
To anyone who is willing to give time and patience 
to the examination of this book in connection with 
a book of the other school there will come a clearer 
and juster view of the scope and the results of the 
work of the Higher Criticism as it has dealt with the 
book of Genesis. 

Such a work of the advanced school is found in 
the translation of Kittel's " The History of the He- 
brews." Professor Kittel is a representative of the 
so-called Dillmann school of Old Testament criti- 
cism, not the most radical of the German schools. 
His mediating attitude has been severely criticized 
by some modern scholars (notably in a fierce review 
of the " History " by the late W. Robertson Smith), 
but without reason. The book requires the same 
detailed study that is demanded by Professor 
Green's " Genesis," and anyone who hopes to find 
in it an interesting story, such as Stanley gave us 
in his lectures on the Jewish Church, will be disap- 
pointed. It is a book for scholars and for those 
who can give time to the study of processes. We 
are not especially impressed with the excellence of 
the translation. Some passages, fortunately not 
many, are made quite unintelligible, and the whole 
is not up to the standard required of modern trans- 
lations. Still, we hail this book with great satisfac- 
tion, because now for the first time is presented to 
students the opportunity of studying in English 
speech a History of Israel, based on the most ap- 
proved results of Higher Criticism and written by 
a learned, devout and candid scholar. 

Few people know that there was another class of 
teachers in Ancient Israel besides the prophets and 
the priests, but so we learn from Professor Kent's 
" The Wise Men of Ancient Israel and Their Pro- 
verbs." Merely to call attention to the work of the 
wise men of the Old Testament is a sufficient rea- 
son for this book. The kernel of its usefulness is 
found in a classification of the precepts of the Book 
of Proverbs according to their significance rather 
than on the helter-skelter method of the original 
collection. Dr. Kent has also furnished a series of 
introductory studies in which he discusses fully and 
very satisfactorily the work of the wise men, the

wisdom literature of the Old Testament, and the 
peculiarities of the Book of Proverbs. Two supple- 
mental studies are also added, the first dealing 
with that inevitable topic contained in every book 
nowadays, " the ' social teachings ' of the Wise Men," 
and the second handling in a fresh way Jesus' use 
of the Book of Proverbs. While there is nothing 
especially original in the book, it is a clever and 
instructive presentation of material which one hith- 
erto would have had to go far to find.

SHORT STORIES BY AMERICAN WRITERS.* 

Every season brings to the library-table a num- 
ber of books which serve particularly to illustrate 
how wide a field is offered the story-writer by the 
diversified geography of our continent and the het- 
erogeneous population by which it is inhabited. This 
literature of the locality and the lesser community, 
taking for the most part the form of the short story, 
swells rapidly in volume, but its possibilities are al- 
most infinite, and the staid city-dweller is only be- 
ginning to realize the variety of the life that finds 
shelter within the broad confines of the Republic. 
Mr. John Fox, Jr. is one of the newest workers in 
this field of the distinctly localized tale or charac- 
ter-study, and his first book, " A Cumberland Ven- 
detta and Other Stories," exhibits strength of con- 
ception and finished workmanship. The Kentucky 
mountaineer is the chosen theme of Mr. Fox, who 
writes from intimate association with the types and 
scenes he has sought to portray, and puts the im- 
press of truth upon his pages. " A Mountain Eu- 
ropa " is a little more conventionalized than the re- 
maining stories in the volume, and suggests some 
of the work of Mr. Bret Harte. Two of the three 
others are practically one continuous narrative, hav- 
ing for their theme a grim mountain feud, as roman- 
tic in interest as any Corsican vendetta. The last 
piece, " On Hell-fer-Sartain Creek," is a sketch of

only two pages, but is a masterpiece of condensed 
dramatic narrative. There is a great deal of dia- 
lect in these stories, but they would be impossible 
without it, and we never feel that it is used out of 
pure wantonness. Mr. Fox has, in this volume, 
achieved a distinct success, and it will not take much 
more of such work to give him high rank among 
our story-writers. 

Mr. Owen Wister's " Red Men and White " is a 
collection of frontier sketches and stories, eight in 
number, which present with vividness of portrayal 
the various types of civilized and uncivilized human- 
ity to be found in the far West. Arizona and Idaho 
are the scenes of most of these sketches, and the 
pages are peopled with Indians, cowboys, miners, 
barroom-loafers, tenderfeet, and soldiers, all drawn 
to the life, and all participating in picturesque, ad- 
venturous, or humorous situations. Mr. Wister's 
story of " The Second Missouri Compromise " is one 
of the best short stories that have ever been told of 
our frontier life. It deals with the unreconstructed 
members of the Territorial Legislature of Idaho in 
the year 1867, and is a story of allegiance to the 
Lost Cause brought into conflict with the very hu- 
man yearning to draw a periodical stipend from the 
money-chest of the despised but victorious govern- 
ment. Another of the stories " The General's 
Bluff " contains some excellent Indian strategy, 
and has General Crook for a central figure. These 
stories have a moral, two morals in fact. One bf 
them is the danger to our civilization resulting from 
the lawlessness of the frontier ; the other is the dif- 
ficulty of dealing with Indian affairs at long range, 
by a lot of wiseacres at Washington who have never 
seen an Indian in his native haunts. Both morals 
are impressively put, and we should as a nation do 
well to heed them. 

" There are gentlemen vagabonds and vagabond 
gentlemen. Here and there one finds a vagabond 
pure and simple, and once in a lifetime one meets 
a gentleman simple and pure. Without premedi- 
tated intent, or mental bias, I have unconsciously 
to myself chosen some one of these several types 
entangling them in the threads of the stories between 
these covers." Thus Mr. Hopkinson Smith prefaces 
his new volume of nine stories and sketches, and 
thus we are to interpret their lesson. The fine al- 
though decayed Southern gentleman of the titular 
story, and the physician who is the unconscious hero 
of " A Knight of the Legion of Honor," are the most 
carefully studied types of gentleman to be found in 
these pages, and their conduct speaks well for the 
ideals of character that most appeal to the author. 
Slight as some of these sketches are, they are all 
informed with a kindliness of spirit that cannot fail 
to touch the heart of the reader, while their pictur- 
esque observation and shrewd humor give them a 
charm that almost makes one forget how fragment- 
ary they are. 

Five other stories go with "The Bachelor's Christ- 
mas " to round out Mr. Robert Grant's new book. 
These stories are studies in light comedy, based upon

incidents frequently improbable, and not notable for 
constructive skill, yet easy, graceful, and entertain- 
ing. Mr. Grant's powers of invention are consid- 
erable, and his themes are therefore less hackneyed 
than with most writers. Humor and pathos alter- 
nately appeal to our attention, the one never bois- 
terous, the other carefully subdued. The stories 
are of the approved " magazine " type, and their col- 
lection results rather in a magazine than in a book. 

It is greatly to be hoped that the popularity of 
" Chimmie Fadden " will not result in swamping us 
with Bowery literature for the next few years, but 
when we think of the way in which the floodgates 
of Scotch dialect have been opened upon us by the 
chroniclers of Thrums and Drumtochty, we realize 
that almost anything may happen. For the present, 
at all events, without taking overmuch thought for 
what is to come, we may find a tempered delight 
in Mr. Townsend's work, and in that of one of the 
best of his rivals, Mr. Julian Ralph, whose " People 
We Pass " is a collection of eight Bowery sketches, 
written from intimate acquaintance with the scenes 
and types of that unique slum. But a few more 
books of the sort would make the Bowery a burden. 
Mr. Ralph's work is excellent journalism, hardly 
more than that. It entertains, touches the senti- 
ment, and appeals to the sense of humor; which 
means that it attains a certain degree of success. 

In " A Mad Madonna and Other Stories " Mr. 
Whitelock developes an idea which, although not 
exactly new, is sufficiently unhackneyed to be worthy 
of treatment. The notion is that of a picture or 
statue coming to life, the myth of Galatea, in short. 
It is the central theme of two out of the six stories, 
and one or two of the others play about the fancy. 
Unfortunately, the author does not possess the im- 
agination necessary to deal successfully with mate- 
rial so elusive, his treatment being rather common- 
place and unimpressive. He fails to get the right 
atmosphere, and atmosphere is everything in such 
dealings with the supernatural. The title-story is 
the best of the half-dozen. 

Six mites of stories, mostly uncanny in subject- 
matter, make up Mrs. Wynne's pretty volume, of 
which we must make some such criticism as was 
given to Mr. Whitelock's collection. The imagin- 
ative atmosphere is lacking, and without it a ghost- 
story is naught. The tale of " The Little Room," 
together with the sequel thereto, fails to stimulate 
more than a languid curiosity, it is all so obviously 
impossible. The mystery is mechanically contrived, 
with but the faintest suggestion of a psychological 
explanation. We are far from asserting that mys- 
teries should always be cleared up, but the fancy 
should be given some clue upon which to work, else are 
we merely baffled at the end, to say nothing of being 
irritated by mere invention without verisimilitude. 

There are but three stories in Miss Murfree's 
volume, and they take us as usual to the Tennessee 
mountains. While there is something of novelty 
about the incidents with which they are concerned, 
the stories impress one, on the whole, as very famil- 



iar. The scenery, the types of character, and the 
motives, are those which the writer has employed 
many times before, as well as the style, which has 
all of the old almost magical quality. We think so 
well of this style that we are all the more pained 
by the false note occasionally sounded. " The blue 
ribbon decorated cattle and horses were bred within 
ten miles of the flaunting flag on the judges' stand, 
and the foaming mountain-torrents and the placid 
stream in the valley beheld no cerulean hues save 
those of the sky which they reflected." There is 
such a thing as going too far in search of synonyms, 
and repetitions are not to be avoided at any cost. 

Mrs. Foote's new volume contains four stories, all 
upon Western themes, and all displaying the felic- 
ity of constructive design and the effective reserve 
of language that we have come to expect from this 
strong writer as a matter of course. Mrs. Foote 
has a way of getting inside her characters, of think- 
ing with them from their own points of view, that 
is really remarkable, and that sets her work upon 
a high plane. " The Cup of Trembling " seems to 
us rather the best of these four admirable stories, 
and outlines a tragic situation not easily to be shaken 
from the memory. 

There is a distinction of style in Miss Guiney's 
four stories that goes far to make up for the ama- 
teurish art by which they are otherwise character- 
ized, which the writer, indeed, frankly admits when 
she says that " they stand for apprentice-work in 
fiction, and are my only attempts of that kind." 
One of them is based upon an incident so similar 
to the story of little Father Time in Mr. Hardy's 
latest novel that Miss Guiney feels it necessary to 
state that the incident was got by her from a news- 
paper some years ago, and worked into its present 
shape before the serial publication of " Heart's In- 
surgent." The first of the four stories, " Lovers' 
Saint Ruth's," for which the author seems to care 
the least, appears to us the most charming of them 
all. It is a sad sweet chronicle of seventeenth cen- 
tury England, deeply felt, and infused with some 
measure of the historical imagination. This book 
is artistically made, and very attractive externally.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. Saintsbury's work is familiar to 
*& readers of current literary criti- 
cism. It is characterized by good 
sense and good temper ; it exhibits wide reading 
and a retentive memory ; its judgments are worded 
in a style that is often pretentious and affected but 
rarely obscure ; it carries the reaction against ped- 
antry so far as to care little for minor inaccuracy 
of statement; it makes pleasant and stimulating 
reading. It is not great criticism because it plays 
about the surface of the subject discussed instead 
of divulging the inner significance, because it lacks 
the quality of inevitableness except where the most

obvious things are concerned. But it conceals its 
lack of the deeper qualities of criticism beneath a 
brilliant display of " points," often acutely made, 
the product of a marked intellectual agility. The 
second series of Mr. Saintsbury's " Essays in En- 
glish Literature, 1780-1860 " (Imported by Scrib- 
ner) abundantly illustrates the characteristics above 
enumerated. The subjects of these essays include 
Southey, Cobbett, Landor, Hood, Miss Ferrier, and 
Madame D' Arblay. There are also essays on " Three 
Humorists," " Some Great Biographies," " The His- 
torical Novel," and " Twenty Years of Political 
Satire." The author disports himself nimbly in 
these diverse fields of investigation, and is always 
entertaining. But why does he persist in writing 
such English as this ? " For who can praise enough, 
or read enough, or enjoy enough, those forty-eight 
volumes of such a reader's paradise as nowhere else 
exists ? The very abundance and relish of their pure 
delightsomeness has obscured in them qualities 
which would have made a score of reputations." 
These sentiments are admirable, for Scott is their 
subject, but we cannot say much for the form in 
which they are expressed. The other book by Mr. 
Saintsbury to which we now have to call attention 
is " A History of Nineteenth Century Literature, 
1780-1895 " (Macmillan). This is the fourth vol- 
ume of the series projected some years ago, to cover 
the whole field of English literature. Mr. Saints- 
bury has already dealt with the Elizabethan period 
in a volume of this series, while Mr. Gosse has 
treated of the period intermediate between the Eliz- 
abethans and our own time. The first volume of 
the work remains to be written. The Rev. Stop- 
ford Brooke was to have done it, but has been pre- 
vented by illness. Meanwhile, his " History of 
Early English Literature " covers half the period 
of the unwritten first volume, although its scale is 
much larger than that upon which the volumes by 
Mr. Saintsbury and Mr. Gosse are prepared. In 
discussing the literature of the nineteenth century, 
Mr. Saintsbury has excluded all authors now living, 
with the one exception of Mr. Buskin. The task 
of summarizing the literary product of England dur- 
ing the past hundred years was no trifling one, and 
has meant an enormous amount of reading on the 
part of the author. He has been called upon to 
express critical judgments by the hundreds, if not 
by the thousands, a fact to be borne in mind be- 
fore one says overharsh things about the airy parade 
of omniscience so characteristic of the work. It is 
a little startling, no doubt, to be told that Moliere 
was no poet at all, that Coleridge's " Wallenstein " 
is better than the original, and that the letters of 
Shelley, Lamb, and FitzGerald are of distinctly 
lower rank than those of Gray, Walpole, Cowper, 
and Byron. But we expect startling dicta now and 
then from Mr. Saintsbury, and need not take them 
very seriously. On the whole, we are thankful for 
this extremely readable history of our nineteenth 
century literature, and predict for it a marked pop- 
ular success. 



We have often spoken of the school 
" reader " as an evil because of the 
scrappy nature of its contents, and 
because its use frequently means tiresome repeti- 
tions and the exclusion of children from the wid- 
est possible range in their reading. But we have 
never denied that the " reader " may have its value, 
or that the preparation of " readers " is an educa- 
tional task well worth undertaking. The difficulty 
is that few persons who have sought to compile such 
volumes of selections have possessed the requisite 
taste and knowledge of literature ; that most of them 
have disregarded the fundamental principle which 
declares that nothing should be admitted which is 
not marked by distinct literary value. We have 
recently received what may fairly be called an ideal 
set of " readers," the " Heart of Oak " books, in six 
numbers, prepared by Professor Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton, and published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
Beginning with a volume of nursery jingles and 
Mother Goose melodies, continuing with classical 
fairy-tales, hero-stories, and poetry that is simple 
yet noble, ending with such authors as Mr. Buskin, 
Carlyle, Macaulay, Lowell, Wordsworth, and Ten- 
nyson, these books, from first to last, contain noth- 
ing but good literature. We may even say more 
than that. Coming upon each successive selection, 
we say not merely : " This is a good thing for chil- 
dren to read, and deserves a place in the volume," 
but rather we say : " What a singularly happy 
thought it was to include this particular piece." 
When we have said this a hundred times or so we 
begin to realize something of the toil and good taste 
that have gone to the making of this series. Two 
other features of the editing deserve to be noticed. 
One of them is that the selections are often very 
long ; in volume three, for example, we have Lamb's 
" Adventures of Ulysses " entire. The other is the 
frequent grouping of pieces relating to a given sub- 
ject. We find in one place, for example, the fol- 
lowing selections : a prose passage on " The Bird " 
from Mr. Buskin, Frere's translation of the great 
chorus from Aristophanes, Arnold's "Poor Mat- 
thias," Milton's sonnet to a nightingale and the ode 
of Keats, Arnold's " Philomela," Wordsworth's and 
Shelley's To a Skylark," and Wordsworth's To 
the Cuckoo." Such groups as this occur in many 
places, each selection in a group not only making 
its own impression, but also deepening the impres- 
sion made by the others. We should also give a 
few words of praise to the notes at the close of each 
volume, and to the accuracy of the texts printed. 
And besides saying all these things, we must find 
space for a quotation or two from Professor Nor- 
ton's preface. " Poetry is one of the most efficient 
means of education of the moral sentiment, as well 
as of the intelligence. It is the source of the best 
culture. A man may know all science and yet re- 
main uneducated. But let him truly possess him- 
self of the work of any one of the great poets, and 
no matter what else he may fail to know, he is not 
without education." " The youth who shall become

door opened to him of all the vast and noble re- 
sources of that life." 

The greatest dramas of the world 

King Arthur. have a11 been sha P ed from tales ' 

legends, or myths, already in some 
degree known to those who heard or read. In fact, 
it is perhaps one of the conditions of great dramatic 
art that it should be free from the requirement of 
ordinary curiosity as to the end and upshot of the 
matter, which is rather a mark of modern literature 
than a universal necessity. The great poet worked 
with material not unfamiliar to his audience, and so 
could count upon an appreciation of his art and an 
interest in his own creation made possible by famil- 
iarity with the traditional guise of the subject mat- 
ter which gave him opportunity. Such is also the 
case with Mr. J. Comyns Carr's play, " King Ar- 
thur" (Macmillan), but in almost inverted wise. 
For while Shakespeare and Goethe took what they 
would from common tradition or the work of lesser 
men before them, this play is founded on material 
which has been fashioned into shape, into a form 
that for most of us is final, by one of the great poets 
of the century. It would be hard if all the associa- 
tions which attach themselves to the names even of 
Lancelot, Guinevere, Elaine, to the mere mention 
of the Round Table and the Holy Grail, if all these 
feelings would not carry us on with interest to the 
end ; and so they do. But the play has not a strong 
character of its own. Mr. Carr, while blending a 
number of Tennyson's motives into a dramatic 
whole, has here and there gone back to Malory, and 
here and there in the good old custom has trusted 
to himself. His play doubtless gives an excellent 
opportunity to Irving in more ways than one. But 
the great tradition and the well-known figures stand 
unchanged, and except for now and then a striking 
phrase, literature is never the richer. The old story 
has no more for us than it had a year ago : perhaps 
it was all that could have been asked, that it should 
mean no less. 

Charles Frangois Gounod's "Me- 
irs of an Artist" (Rand, Me- 
Nally & Co.), is a readable little 
book, eminently wholesome and stimulating in tone, 
which narrates briefly and unaffectedly the events 
bearing upon the writer's artistic career and devel- 
opment, from early childhood down to the period of 
the production of " Faust " at which point the 
recital unaccountably breaks off. M. Gounod's 
pages are strewn with memories of his more or less 
distinguished friends and preceptors, M. Reicha, 
Cherubini, Ingres the painter, Mendelssohn, and 
Madam Henzel, etc. Ingres he met at Rome, whither 
he (M. Gounod) was sent in 1834, after winning at 
the Paris Conservatory the grand prix de Home. 
He paints an engaging portrait of this artist, then 



director of the Academy of France, at Rome, and 
tells a pretty story illustrative of his devotion to 
artistic truth. M. Ingres was then at work on his 
fine " Vierge a 1'Hostie," destined for the Demidoff 
collection ; and M. Gounod states that in the origi- 
nal composition the foreground was not occupied, 
as now, by the mystic ciborium, but by an exquisite 
figure of the infant Jesus lying asleep, his head rest- 
ing upon a cushion, one tassel of which he seemed 
to be playing with. M. Ingres, he continues, seemed 
well satisfied, and when the waning light obliged 
him to suspend work, he was delighted with the 
day's performance. But, adds M. Gounod, " in the 
afternoon of the next day I ascended again to his 
studio. No more infant Jesus ! The figure had 
disappeared, scraped off entirely with a palette- 
knife, not a trace of it remaining. ' Ah ! M. Ingres ! ' 
cried I, in consternation. And he, with a triumph- 
ant air, replied : ' Man Dieu, yes ! ' And then again, 
with stronger emphasis, ' Yes ! ' The splendor of 
the divine symbol had just appeared to him superior 
to the radiant human reality, and, therefore, more 
worthy of the homage of the Virgin adoring her 
Son." It is interesting to note that M. Gounod's 
favorite employment at Rome was the reading of 
Goethe's " Faust "; and that his first idea of the 
Walpurgis Night, of the opera composed seventeen 
years later, came to him during a nocturnal excur- 
sion to Capri. Aside from its purely narrative ele- 
ment, the memoir contains some valuable comment 
and criticism ; and it deserves to be read and pon- 
dered by students of music. But the best of the 
book, to our notion, is the impression it leaves of 
the author's singularly pure and genuine character. 
The translation is acceptably done by Miss Annette 
E. Crocker, and the publishers have displayed due 
taste as to externals, the emblematic cover being espe- 
cially well done. 

The future ^- verv readable and suggestive little 

American book, albeit rather more abstractive 

literary type. m j. one t nan jfg title seems to imply, 

is " Types of American Character " (Macmillan), 
by Gamaliel Bradford, Jr. Of the seven essays 
contained in the volume, three, " The American Pes- 
simist," " The American Idealist," and " The Ameri- 
can Out of Doors," have already appeared in the "At- 
lantic Monthly "; while the others, " The American 
Epicurean," "The American Philanthropist," "The 
American Man of Letters," and " The Scholar," are 
now printed for the first time. Mr. Bradford's book 
is fresh, thoughtful, and stimulating, and its style 
is indicative throughout of the excellent literary 
company its author has kept. Among the many 
interesting questions touched upon is the moot one : 
What will be the first really great original literary 
development of this country? The still lacking, 
though not impossible one, who is to shape the course 
of our impending distinctively national literature, 
and be its herald and morning star, will prove to 
be not the novelist, not the dramatist, not even 
the threatened far- Western bard, fresh from the

ploughtails, free as the unyoked steer, and redolent 
of the virgin soil of his own billowy prairies but, 
Mr. Bradford thinks, the humorist, some " true son 
of Aristophanes and Rabelais and Cervantes, who 
will prick the bubble of our vast self-satisfaction, 
without bitterness, without harshness, with none of 
the cynical satire of the French pessimistic school." 
His first principle will be laughter, but his second 
will be love ; he will ridicule many things ; he will 
tread on a great many people's toes ; but he will do 
it all with such a charming grace, and with so plainly 
benevolent an intent, that his victims will smile at 
their own smarts. He will love those whom he 
chastens as the true humorist must ; and, says Mr. 
Bradford, " I should advise him to inscribe on his 
title-page these charming verses, which I borrow 
from M. Anatole France, who has himself borrowed 
them from I know not where, 

' Les petites marionettes 
Font, font, font, 
Trois petits tours 
Et puis s'en vont.' " 

Let us admit that our coming Cervantes will find 
no lack of butts for his shafts. 



A wen-edited The University of Chicago inaugu- 
edition of an rates a new series of monographs, to 

old poem. be k nown as English Studies," with 

the publication of an edition of Lydgate's "The 
Assembly of Gods." Dr. Oscar Lovell Triggs is 
the editor of this text, and the work was offered to 
the University in support of his candidacy for the 
doctor's degree. It will also be published in Lon- 
don, in the series of the Early English Text Society. 
In his introductory chapters, the editor describes 
the manuscripts and the prints of the work, and dis- 
cusses the questions of title, date and authorship, 
metre, rhyme, and language. Then follows a lit- 
erary analysis of the poem, and a series of special 
" literary studies " of its more salient features. The 
text follows, in 61 pages and 2107 numbered lines. 
Some thirty pages of notes, a catalogue of persons, 
a glossary, and a collection of " special phrases and 
proverbs " complete the apparatus of this remarka- 
bly well-edited book. The poem itself is not ex- 
actly readable, but Dr. Triggs has done his best to 
make it so. His treatment has a marked literary 
character, very noticeable in the special studies and 
the notes, which sets it in refreshing contrast to most 
studies in Middle or Old English literature. He 
brings a wide range of reading to bear upon his 
work at every point, and his collection of parallel- 
isms is extremely interesting. Altogether, his work 
is distinctly creditable to English scholarship, and 
justifies the great quantity of labor that must have 
been expended upon it. 

M. Jusserand is already known to 

The minor studies , , t . . 

ofM. Jusserand. American readers, and his new vol- 
ume, " English Essays from a French 
Pen " (Putnams), will not diminish his reputation. 
It is not an especially noteworthy book by reason of 



its subject-matter, for it gathers together five essays 
which have no particular importance and no very 
definite connection. But each subject the author 
has handled in an entertaining way, so that one 
reads everything with pleasure ; indeed, he seems to 
possess to a great degree the art of telling a story. 
So, although three of his essays are of that very un- 
promising kind, running summaries of the con- 
tents of books, yet all have something at least of 
the power of attracting the attention and of holding 
the interest. Two of the essays are rather slight, 
one an account of the dangers besetting the life of a 
nun in the twelfth century, and the other a note on 
Voltaire's visit to England, both drawn from some- 
what recondite sources. The more extended pieces 
of work are accounts of Girard's journey to Scot- 
land in 1435, and of Sorbiere's journey to England 
in 1663, and a very entertaining study of the life 
and work of Scarron. These have been published 
before ; the first two in the " Nineteenth Century," 
the last as introduction to a translation of Scarron's 
" Roman Comique." There is more body to these 
three than to the two shorter ones, which come as 
curtain-raiser and after-piece. But all five will be 
found good reading (a Frenchman is almost always 
amusing) and full of curious information, so that 
there is not much more to ask of them. The book 
has several good illustrations, some from sources 
contemporary with the topics, some otherwise ap- 
propriate.

able student of early American manners, Mrs. Alice 
Morse Earle. To those familiar with the author's 
work, and most of us are, the drift of the vol- 
ume is sufficiently indicated by such chapter head- 
ings as " Consorts and Relicts," "Women of Affairs," 
"The Colonial Adventuresses," "Their Amuse- 
ments and Accomplishments," " Daughters of Lib- 
erty," " Fireside Industries," etc. Mrs. Earle writes 
in her usual pleasant vein, interlarding her work with 
copious extracts from old-time records, and lighting 
up with her sedate humor a subject in itself not an 
especially engaging or stimulating one. Mrs. Earle 
has a light touch and a sense of style ; and her friends 
would perhaps be glad should she allow her pen to 
range afield occasionally, and to stray from a theme 
wherein her manner tends to stereotype itself. 



A charming 
tribute to 

Stevenson. 



It is a little late to call attention to 
the study of Robert Louis Stevenson 
by A. B., with a prelude and a post- 
lude by L. I. G., that was privately printed by 
Messrs. Copeland & Day some months ago, but the 
booklet should not pass unmentioned. The initials 
of the writers are so transparent that we do not feel 
that we are violating the ethics of criticism in speak- 
ing of Miss Brown and Miss Guiney as the authors 
of this charming tribute to a beloved memory. Miss 
Guiney 's part of the work is in verse, a little labored,

but full of fine feeling ; Miss Brown's essay is a 
graceful criticism in part a mosaic of anecdote 
and citation of the life and work of Stevenson. 
The note of enthusiasm is pitched in a higher key 
than the temperate judgment of a later day will, in 
our opinion, allow, and we cannot admit that it was 
ever " a commonplace of criticism to name him the 
greatest living master of English style, sharing the 
unvexed throne with Ruskin only." But he was a 
noble writer and a beautiful soul, deserving, in both 
aspects, of most good things that his friends may 
find it in .their hearts to write. The curious thing 
about Miss Brown's essay is that the writer's hand 
has become so subdued to what it works in that 
Stevenson's own prose style is in many a passage 
unconsciously reproduced. Over and over again, 
we come upon paragraphs that might have been 
written by the subject of the appreciation, so felici- 
tous is the phrase and so Stevensonian the choice 
of epithet. Those who are fortunate enough to get 
possession of this little volume wiH be sure to treas- 
ure it highly. 

" Longmans's Gazetteer of the 

w rld '" edited b y Mr - Geor s e c - 

Chisholm, is one of those monument- 
al works of reference that characterize the latter- 
day enterprises of the publishing craft, and command 
admiration for the solidity of their performance. 
The book is a quarto of about eighteen hundred 
double-columned pages, with subjects in heavy-faced 
type, and descriptions so condensed as to require 
only a minimum of space. Our own " Lippincott's 
Gazetteer," with its three thousand odd pages, is 
much the bigger book of the two, although mechan- 
ically not quite so well proportioned. In the " Long- 
mans," of course, British names get relatively more 
attention than in the " Lippincott," and possibly for 
that reason some persons will have to keep both 
works upon their shelves. The larger articles in 
the present work have been written by specialists, 
and are initialed. The general rule of orthography 
for foreign names is to employ the native spelling of 
languages which use roman characters ; for exam- 
ple, Trondhjem is not given as Drontheim. Reason- 
able precautions seem to have been taken to secure 
accurate up-to-date information, and the coopera- 
tion of a host of special correspondents all over the 
world has given a singular degree of reliability to 
the contents of this noteworthy volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Volume III. of "The Life and Correspondence of 
Rufus King," edited by his grandson, Dr. Charles R. 
King, has just appeared from the press of Messrs. G. 
P. Putnam's Sons. It covers the years 1799-1801, and 
" takes up the correspondence at the point of time when 
President Adams had proposed to send a new embassy 
to France to take advantage of what appeared to him 
an opportunity to settle the questions which had caused 
the breaking off the amicable relations with France and 



the annulling of the treaty with that country." This 
subject and the disputed election of 1800 mainly oc- 
cupy the new volume, which is a rich mine of materials 
for the future historian. 

Renan's " Life of Jesus " has been reissued by Messrs. 
Roberts Brothers in a " translation newly revised from 
the twenty-third and final edition." Mr. Joseph Henry 
Allen, who appears to be responsible for the present 
(and presumably definitive) form of the English text, 
tells us, in a preface, that " the two best known English 
translations have been freely used, while nearly every 
sentence has been recast, and the whole has been scru- 
pulously weighed, phrase by phrase, with the original." 
An examination of the text, as far as we have made it, 
bears out this claim of careful workmanship, and it is 
not likely that Renan's beautiful French will ever get a 
more nearly satisfactory English reproduction than this. 

The Field Columbian Museum has already entered 
the publishing field with a number of scientific mono- 
graphs of much value. Series of publications in history, 
geology, botany, and zoology, have been started, and 
now a new series has been added with anthropology for 
its general subject. The first volume in this series is a 
work upon the " Monuments of Yucatan," by Mr. Will- 
iam H. Holmes. The author, who is Curator of the De- 
partment of Anthropology in the Museum, was one of 
a party of scientific men who spent three months of last 
year in Mexico. The present work is a report, illus- 
trated with numerous plates, of the author's investiga- 
tion of the Yucatan remains, and makes a valuable con- 
tribution to American archaeological science. 

The latest text-books in science and mathematics in- 
clude the following: " Robinson's New Higher Arithme- 
tic" (American Book Co.), a volume of over five hun- 
dred pages, the product of successive revisions and 
improvements; " Trigonometry for Schools and Col- 
leges" (Ginn), by Mr. Frederick Anderegg and Mr. 
Edward D. Roe, Jr. ; " Laboratory Work in Chemistry " 
(American Book Co.), by Mr. Edward H. Reiser; 
" Chemical Experiments," General and Analytical 
(Ginn), a laboratory manual by Mr. R. P. Williams; a 
capital work on the " Elements of Botany " (Ginn), by 
Mr. Joseph Y. Bergen; a new edition of Mr. William 
Peddie's " Manual of Physics " (Putnam), for advanced 
students; and an "Elementary Treatise on Electricity 
and Magnetism " (Longmans) founded on M. Joubert's 
work by Messrs. G. C. Foster and E. Atkinson, and very 
far from being elementary in the ordinary sense. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" Old Goriot," with a preface by Mr. Saintsbury, is 
added to the Dent-Macmillan Balzac. Miss Ellen Mar- 
riage is the translator. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. have added " Smoke " to 
their edition of Tourgue"nieff, the translation by Mrs. 
Constance Garnett, the introduction by Mr. Edward 
Garnett. 

" The New Unity," of which Messrs. Way & Will- 
iams will henceforth be the publishers, appears with the 
issue of March 5 in a new and greatly improved typo- 
graphical dress. 

" The Inland Printer " has issued a handsome calen- 
dar for 1896 in three colors, from a design by Bradley 
made for the cover of the Christmas issue of that ex- 
cellent publication.

" Hazell's Annual," marvellous as ever for compact- 
ness, appears for 1896 with the usual complement of 
new articles upon timely subjects. It is imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" Money in Politics," a useful book by Mr. J. K. Up- 
ton, first published in 1884, now reappears from the 
press of the Lothrop Publishing Co., in revised form, 
with Mr. Edward Atkinson's introduction as before. 

" Cherry-Bloom " is the title of a collection of " bits 
of verse from summer-land," from the pen of Miss 
Eleanor Mary Ladd, and published in very dainty and 
attractive form by the Peter Paul Book Co., of Buffalo. 

" The Woodlanders " and " The Trumpet Major " are 
additions to the highly satisfactory library edition of Mr. 
Hardy's novels, now in course of publication by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. Each volume has a new etched 
frontispiece. 

The Roycroft Printing Shop, of East Aurora, New 
York, announces an edition of " The Song of Songs," 
with a study by Mr. Elbert Hubbard. The book will 
be beautifully printed, and limited to six hundred and 
twelve copies. 

Charles Carleton Coffin, war correspondent and writer 
of good books for the young, born in 1823, died sud- 
denly in Brookline, Mass., on the second of March. 
Most men who were boys in the sixties will have an af- 
fectionate remembrance of " Winning His Way." 

Mr. Samuel H. Ranck, of the Pratt Library, Balti- 
more, makes a lengthy argument in the " Library Jour- 
nal " for such an amendment to our copyright laws as 
shall require new books to be deposited in a number of

brary alone, as at present. 

" The Home Journal " of New York, has come to its 
semi-centennial, and celebrates the event with a " ju- 
bilee " issue, devoted, in large part, to the history of the 
paper, and with portraits and reminiscences of the famous 
men who have been connected with its management, 
Willis and Morris, of course, being particularly conspic- 
uous. 

That curious farrago of romance and scientific vagary 
called " Etidorhpa " (a name which puzzled us until we 
spelled it backwards), by Mr. John Uri Lloyd, has 
passed into a second edition, and into the hands of the 
Robert Clarke Co., of Cincinnati. It is now published 
in less luxurious form than before, and at half the for- 
mer price. 

The Morgan Park Academy of the University of Chi- 
cago, which is rapidly securing recognition as one of the 
best fitting schools in the country, has regular courses 
during the summer, thus following the unique plan of 
the University itself. It is stated that each student at 
the Academy last year cost the institution $125 more 
than the tuition paid, which well illustrates the value 
of educational endowments. 

" The Psychological Review " has recently issued two 
important supplements to its regular bi-monthly series. 
One is " The Psychological Index " for 1895, an inval- 
uable classified guide to the latest literature of the sub- 
ject; the other is a "Monograph Supplement " on "As- 
sociation," by Miss Mary Whiton Calkins. This is the 
second of a series of monographs which already includes 
a treatise " On Sensations from Pressure and Impact," 
by Mr. Harold Griffing, and to which will soon be added 
"A Study of Kant's Psychology," by Mr. E. F. Buch- 
ner, and " Mental Development of a Child," by Miss 
Kathleen Moore. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS. 

The annual list of books announced for Spring pub- 
lication presented herewith is the largest and most 
comprehensive we have yet prepared, containing very 
nearly 500 separate titles, as against 300 last year, and 
representing 62 publishers, as against 34 in 1895. The 
largest number of titles from any one house is 56, the 
smallest is 1, and the average is over 8 to each firm. 
The list is a most creditable one to the enterprise and 
activity of the American publishing trade, and readers 
and book-buyers of all classes will find much to interest 
them in the various categories. It should be added that 
Spring publications already out and received at this 
office are not included in this list.

By JOHN R. COMMONS, Professor of Sociology in Syracuse University. One vol., V.+ 298 pp. With Diagram,

Professor Commons argues forcibly and eloquently in favor of the plan adopted and recommended by the American Pro- 
portional Representation League, of which he was the founder. He believes that proportional representation will do away 
with the spoils system, and will be an effective agent in municipal and social reform ; and will finally result in freedom from 
the rule of the party machine, and in the purification of our politics.

BY 



MARIE CORELLI, 

The Mighty Atom. 

Uniform with " The Sorrows of Satan," " Barabbas," and " Cameos." Large 12mo. 

Buckram, $1.25. 

There is no question that Marie Corelli is one of the strongest writers now living. She is endowed with a 
wonderfully clear and vigorous imagination, the prime qualification for a novelist, and yet, strangely enough, one 
in which so many novelists of the present day are sadly deficient. This of itself gives her stories a sweep and 
power seldom attained, and although she does write with a purpose, it is never obtruded upon the reader. Her 
" Barabbas " made a most profound sensation, and it is unquestionably one of the strongest, most graphic, and 
most vivid books of this decade. Her " Sorrows of Satan " is another romance of thrilling, almost startling, 
power. In this new novel she has chosen a subject of remarkable interest, and has treated it in a most individual 
and stimulating way. 

OTHER NOVELS BY MARIE CORELLI. 



Cameos. 

By MARIE CORELLI. 12mo. Buckram, $1.00. 

"Marie Corelli possesses a charm as a writer that perhaps 
has never been better displayed than in her recent work, 
" Cameos." Burlington Hawk-Eye. 

" As long as Miss Corelli can write stories like these she 
will not lack readers. In this volume she gives new and con- 
vincing proof of versatility, spirit, tenderness, and power." 
Chicago Tribune. 

Barabbas : 

A Dream of the World's Tragedy. 

By MARIE CORELLI. 12 mo. Buckram, $1.00. 
During its comparatively brief existence this remark- 
able book has been translated into French, German, 
Swedish, Hindoostani, and Gujerati. In England and 
America, the phenomenal demand for the work still 
exhausts edition after edition in rapid succession. 
"It is a succession of skilful and finished pictures, with 
human passion." San Francisco Chronicle. 

" It is a remarkable book, and will be read with much in- 
terest for its vividness of style and undoubted ability." New 
York Observer. 

" Tragic intensity and imaginative vigor are the features of 
this powerful tale." Philadelphia Ledger. 

"The book is strongly written and is of intense interest." 
Advance, Chicago. 

"The conception of the story is fine." N. Y. Evangelist. 
" One feels in reading this book that an able hand has held 
the pen." The Living Church, Chicago. 

"Alike the most reviled, the best praised, and the widest 
read book of the day." London World. 

" The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative

By ERNEST HART, formerly Surgeon to the West Lon-

Hospital, London. With 20 Illustrations. New Edi- 
tion, enlarged and revised. With new chapters on 
"The Eternal Gullible" and "The Hypnotism of 
Trilby." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Dr. Hart is not an enemy of the spiritual, but he gives ground to 
neither the supernatural nor the preternatural when he can help it. His 
state of mind is generally impartial.' 1 Chicago Post. 

" Mr. Hart holds it as proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the 
hypnotic condition is an admitted clinical fact, and declares that the 
practice of hypnotism, except by skilled physicians, should be forbidden. 
He affirms its therapeutic uselessness, and condemns the practice be- 
cause of the possibilities of social mischiefs. . . . His personal experi- 
ences in the ' New Witchcraft ' enable him to exercise a critical check 
on the wild theories and unsupported assertions of others." Philadel- 
phia, Ledger.

B y Mrs. W. K. CLIFFORD, author of " Love Letters of 
a Worldly Woman," Aunt Anne," etc. No. 189, 
Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; 
cloth, $1.00. 
Mrs. Clifford's rank as one of the most brilliant writers of 

modern literary London is known to all readers. This novel 

is regarded as a work of especial strength. 

CLEG KELLY, ARAB OF THE CITY. 

His Progress and Adventures. 

By S. R. CROCKETT, author of " The Lilac Sunbonnet," 
" Bog-Myrtle and Peat," etc. With 8 full-page Illus- 
trations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

It is safe to predict for the quaint and delightful figure of 
Cleg Kelly a notable place in the literature of the day. Mr. 
Crockett's signal success in his new field will enlarge the wide 
circle of his admirers. The lights and shadows of curious 
phases of Edinburgh life, and of Scotch farm and railroad life, 
are pictured with an intimate sympathy, richness of humor, 
and truthful pathos which make this new novel a genuine ad- 
dition to literature. It seems safe to say that at least two 
characters Cleg and Muckle Alick are likely to lead Mr. 
Crockett's heroes in popular favor. The illustrations of this 
fascinating novel have been the result of most faithful and 
sympathetic study. 

VOICE BUILDING AND TONE PLACING. 

By H. HOLBROOK CURTIS, Ph.B., M.D. Showing a 

New Method of Relieving Injured Vocal Cords by 

Tone Exercises. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

Probably no laryngologist since the time of Sir Morell 

Mackenzie has had a better opportunity for investigating the 

subject of voice production and the effects upon the larynx of 

different methods of singing than has the author of this book. 

As Dr. Curtis has dedicated his work to Jean de Keszke, and 

has been guided in his chapters on Voice Building by no less 

an authority than Madame Melba, it is safe to say that the 

work will have an especial interest for the musical as well as 

for the medical world. 

MISTRESS DOROTHY MARVIN. 

By J. C. SNAITH. No. 188, Town and Country Library. 

12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 

This stirring- historical romance pictures the stormy career 
of a hero who took part in the events of the latter part of the 
seventeenth century in England. The reader shares in the 
adventures attendant upon Monmouth's Rebellion and the 
coming of William of Orange. It is a story of narrow escapes, 
of excellent fighting, and of continued and breathless interest. 

"The book is lively from beginning to end. ... It is healthy-toned 
and yery readable." London Spectator. 



SLEEPING FIRES. 

By GEORGE GISSIXG, author of " In the Year of Jubilee," 
"Eve's Ransom," etc. 16mo, cloth, 75 cents. 
In this striking story the author has treated an original mo- 
tive with rare self-command and skill. His book is most inter- 
esting as a story and remarkable as a literary performance. 

IN THE BLUE PIKE. 

A Romance of German Life in the Beginning of the Six- 
teenth Century. By GEORG EBERS, author of " In the 
Fire of the Forge," " Cleopatra," etc. Translated by 
MARY J. SAFFORD. 16mo, paper, 40 cts. ; cloth, 75 cts. 

Dr. Ebers has chosen a most picturesque time for his ro- 
mance, and his command of local color is admirably exhibited 
in the course of his interesting story. 

IN THE DAY OF ADVERSITY. 

A Romance. By J. BLOUNDELLE- BURTON, author of 

" The Hispaniola Plate," " His Own Enemy," etc. No. 

187, Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 

cents; cloth, $1.00. 

This thrilling historical romance suggests the spirit and 
action of Weyman's " Gentleman of France," and in addition 
to this a child plays a novel and touching part, which will ap- 
peal to the sympathies of all readers. 

THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. 

An Episode of the American Civil War. By STEPHEN 
CRANE. Fourth Edition. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" Holds one irrevocably. There is no possibility of resistance when 
once you are in its grasp." Pall Mall Gazette. 

" A truer and completer picture of war than either Tolstoy or Zola. " 
London New Review. 

THE EXPLOITS OF BRIGADIER GERARD. 

By A. CONAN DOYLE, author of " The Stark Munro 
Letters," " Round the Red Lamp," etc. Illustrated. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

There is a flavor of Dumas's Musketeers in the life of the 
redoubtable Brigadier Gerard, a typical Napoleonic soldier, 
more fortunate than many of his compeers because some of his 
Homeric exploits were accomplished under the personal obser- 
vation of the Emperor. His delightfully romantic career in- 
cluded an oddly characteristic glimpse of England, and his 
adventures ranged from the battle-field to secret service. In 
picturing the experiences of his fearless, hard-fighting, and 
hard-drinking hero, the author of "The White Company" 
has given us a book which absorbs the interest and quickens 
the pulse of every reader. The popularity of these stories 
when they were published serially, each one securely protected 
by copyright, insures the success of this book. 

GREENLAND ICEFIELDS, AND LIFE IN 
THE NORTH ATLANTIC. 

With a New Discussion of the Causes of the Ice Age. 
By G. FREDERICK WRIGHT, D.D., LL.D., author of 
" The Ice Age in North America," etc., and WARREN 
UPHAM, A.M., late of the Geological Survey. With 
numerous Maps and Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

The immediate impulse to the preparation of this volume 
arose in connection with a trip to Greenland by Professor 
Wright in the summer of 1894 on the steamer Miranda. The 
work aims to give within moderate limits a comprehensive 
view of the scenery, the glacial phenomena, the natural history, 
the people, and the explorations of Greenland. The photo- 
graphs, some sixty in number, are all original, and the maps 
nave been prepared to show the latest state of knowledge con- 
cerning the region. The work is of both popular and scientific 
interest ; there is none other upon the subject so comprehensive.

THE ARNOLD AFTERMATH. 

The Book par excellence of the year 1895 
was the one that gave to the world the familiar 
letters of Matthew Arnold. Addressed, for 
the most part, to the members of his own house- 
hold group, these letters were yet seen to have 
so varied a bearing, to touch with delicate sure 
hand upon so many of the subjects more for- 
mally discussed in his books, to throw side- 
lights so suggestive upon the distinguished in- 
tellectual personality of their writer, that they 
were promptly hailed as being far more than a 
charming contribution to epistolary literature, 
as outstretching once more a hand previously 
found helpful to men and women wandering 
amid the perplexities of the selva oscura of 
modern thought. Since their publication, they 
have called forth tributes of affectionate ap- 
preciation from some of the keenest critics 
and finest spirits of our time, and in all the 
chorus of grateful praise there have been but 
few discordant notes. One of the most gener- 
ous and eloquent estimates of Arnold's work 
in its totality is that just contributed to " The 
Nineteenth Century " by Mr. Frederic Harri- 
son, an estimate not made with particular ref- 
erence to the ''Letters," yet doubtless prompted 
by their publication, and by the feeling that it 
is time to make at least a tentative effort to de- 
termine the position of their writer in the liter- 
ature which he adorned for so many years. In 
our epoch, opinion concerning the dead crystal- 
lizes more rapidly than it used to, and the judg- 
ment of posterity may be anticipated with some- 
thing more of confidence than formerly. 

Recurring for a moment to the " Letters " 
themselves, it may be said that they have done 
much to fix for us a personality more gracious 
than was at all times reflected from the 
" Works." We see more clearly than before 
the simple and lovable core of the man's char- 
acter ; we see that the heart was unaffected if 
the intellect sometimes found expression in 
mannerisms ; we see how mythical is the notion 
that anything like superciliousness was charac- 
teristic of his attitude toward his fellows ; we 
see how unreservedly his life was given to the 
service of mankind, how little he thought of 
himself and how much he thought of his ideals.

ers, this affectionate son and tender father, this 
gentle critic who dealt so urbanely with every 
form of rhetorical and political and ethical 
humbug, this whole image of the man himself 
as he appears in his letters, is as unlike as pos- 
sible to the counterfeit presentment which the 
newspapers so sedulously sought to impose 
upon their readers as genuine portraiture. 

One thing, in particular, was never clearly 
understood before the appearance of the " Let- 
ters." The public knew Arnold as the brilliant 
essayist and exquisite poet, as the apostle of 
culture and the ardent advocate of the things 
of the spirit ; it knew him hardly at all as the 
hard-working inspector of schools. It knew 
that, like Milton's, his " soul was like a star 
and dwelt apart "; it did not realize that also, 
for all this spiritual isolation, his heart " the 
lowliest duties on herself did lay." When we 
read of the years of incessant drudgery conse- 
quent upon his inspectorship, of his visits to 
countless schools and his marking of countless 
examination papers, it does seem as if England 
might have found a worthier use for the talents 
of so exceptional a man. But we quickly re- 
flect, on the other hand, that it is precisely 
such thankless work as this that calls most im- 
peratively for the finest qualities of mind and 
heart, that the supreme test of social usefulness 
is met only by those who are content to do the 
work that lies at hand, the work that escapes 
careless observation, yet endures because of the 
single-hearted faithfulness of its performance. 

The world is slowly coming to recognize how 
important were Arnold's contributions to polit- 
ical and religious discussion, although many 
writers are still found to carp at his methods 
and results. Even Mr. Harrison, who does 
ample justice to the literary critic and the poet, 
cannot refrain from bringing against Arnold 
the old charge of dilettantism in these other 
matters, from pretending that he was without 
a " scheme of dominant ideas." We refuse to 
believe that Mr. Harrison has been so imposed 
upon by Arnold's playfulness of manner as 
really to think that the great critic was only 
taking a few random shots when he entered the 
field of political and religious controversy. Be- 
cause Arnold refused to talk about theology 
and politics in a dull pedantic fashion, and 
thereby defeat his main object, he must, for- 
sooth, be treated with condescension by men 
whose influence upon thought in these very do- 
mains has been far inferior to his own. The 
implication is an amusing one. As for Mr. 
Harrison's attempt to prove Arnold an uncon- 



scious Comtist, it is provocative of something 
broader than the mere smile of amusement. 

On the other hand, Mr. Harrison does ample 
justice to Arnold the poet and critic, voicing 
what we cannot but believe will prove substan- 
tially the estimate of the future. Arnold's 
poetry, we are told, " is almost certain to gain 
a wider audience, and to grow in popularity 
and influence." These are just words of the 
poet, and equally just is Mr. Harrison's ac- 
count of the critic. "Not that Arnold was 
invariably right, or that all his judgments are 
unassailable. His canons were always right ; 
but it is not in mortals to apply them unerringly 
to men and to things. ... I accept his decis- 
ions in the main for all English poetry, and on 
general questions of style. . . . Arnold's piece 
on ' The Study of Poetry ' . . . should be pre- 
served in our literature as the norma or canon 
of right opinion about poetry, as we preserve 
the standard coins in the Pyx, or the standard 
yard in the old Jewel-house at Westminster." 
This is not saying too much, if it be understood 
that allowance is made for the errors of the 
personal equation. A few of these errors crept 
into Arnold's books, and a number of others are 
to be detected in his letters. As Mr. Harrison 
aptly remarks of the latter, " a great critic, like 
the Pope, is infallible only when he is speak- 
ing ex cathedra, on matters of faith." 

American feeling for Arnold has always 
been affected by the sense that he was not alto- 
gether just to our civilization. He seemed to 
detect our faults more readily than our virtues. 
It is true that his attitude became noticeably 
modified after he had seen America with his 
own eyes, but his earlier utterances had excited 
a hostility that was not so easily to be allayed. 
There is some slight justification for the resent- 
ment that Americans have felt for his attitude, 
although there is none for the manner in which 
they have given expression to the failing. The 
publication of the " Letters," also, was some- 
thing of an indiscretion as far as the American 
section of the correspondence is concerned. 
The editor was not as careful in expunging 
allusions that might prove irritating to Amer- 
icans as he was in the case of allusions to liv- 
ing Englishmen. The instances are trivial 
enough, yet Arnold himself would never in the 
world have permitted some of these things to 
get into print. As for his general estimate of 
American civilization, we are minded to repro- 
duce a significant passage from a letter dated 
1877. " That wonderful creature, the British 
Philistine, has been splashing about during this 



1896.]

war in a way more than worthy of himself. 
That is what is peculiar to England and what 
misleads foreigners ; there is no country in the 
world where so much nonsense becomes so pub- 
lic, and so appears to stand for the general voice 
of the nation, determining the government." 
Unfortunately for us, the situation here de- 
scribed is not peculiar to England, for it is 
even more characteristic of the United States. 
What a pity that Arnold did not recognize this 
fact, and keep it constantly in mind when he 
set out to discuss American civilization ! Had 
he done so, many heart-burnings would have 
been spared, and the few vulnerable points in 
his critical armor would have been one the less. 



AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SECOND- 
ARY SCHOOLS COMPARED* 

The recent report made by the Committee on 
Composition and Rhetoric to the Board of Over- 
seers of Harvard College, and the comments that it 
has called out in the press, have again directed the 
public attention to the comparative merits of sec- 
ondary education in the United States and in the 
leading countries of Western Europe. There ap- 
pears to be no doubt that the average American 
student, at the age of nineteen, brought up in the 
secondary schools, is behind the English or Conti- 
nental student of the same age in ability to compose 
in his mother tongue and in ability to perform other 
scholastic work. Professor Goodwin says that boys 
of that age who come to Harvard College in most 
cases " are barely prepared to pass an examination 
which boys of sixteen or seventeen would find easy 
work in England, Germany, France, or Switzer- 
land." He says, further, that at "Westminster 
School, London, boys of from fifteen to eighteen 
are studying Homer, JEschylus, Sophocles, Euri- 
pides, Aristophanes, Lysius, Plato, Lucretius, Ter- 
ence, Horace, Cicero, St. Augustine, St. Cyril, with 
algebra, trigonometry, conic sections, statics, and 
dynamics." Much of this work is not required 
for admission to Oxford and Cambridge, but it 
counts for honors. The Professor says further : 
" There is no hope of a substantial change for the 
better until the elementary studies which now occupy 
the time from fifteen to nineteen are put back where 
they belong, so that young men can devote them- 
selves in earnest to studies which belong to their 
age." From this point of view, therefore, the ques- 
tion, Why is the English teaching in our secondary

schools bad ? is expanded into the broader one, Why 
is our secondary education as a whole bad? 

This question has been much discussed the last 
few years, and in the course of the discussion it 
has been discovered that, in large part, the trouble 
lies below the secondary-school level. The Har- 
vard Committee and Professor Goodwin tend to ex- 
cuse the secondary teachers from blame for the bad 
preparation of students for college. The trouble, 
they say, is with the " system." This is extending 
the investigation to the elementary schools, which 
leads to the remark that the shortening and enrich- 
ening of the elementary course has been a favorite 
topic at educational meetings and in educational 
journals for some time past. I shall set down 
very briefly what appear to me to be the principal 
reasons why the American boy of nineteen, consid- 
ered as a scholar, is two years in the rear of the 
German, French, or English boy of the same age. 

1. The courses of study that lead French and 
German boys to the university have been brought to 
a high degree of perfection. The studies have been 
so selected and so coordinated that time is saved all 
along the line. For example, in the German gym- 
nasium Latin begins at ten and Greek at twelve, 
while modern languages are brought in at an early 
stage, thus assisting materially the mastery of Ger- 
man. The gymnasium is not a finishing school, but 
every step from the first one is bent toward the uni- 
versity. Practically the same may be said of the 
French and English schools. In the United States, 
on the other hand, secondary courses of study have 
not been as well thought out and tested. Moreover, 
the double function of many of our schools, and par- 
ticularly of high schools, has impaired their effi- 
ciency in both spheres. Reference is made, of 
course, to the fact that these schools are at the same 
time finishing schools for life and fitting schools for 
college. To be sure, the courses of study intended 
for the two purposes more or less vary. Whether 
this impairment of the American school is inherent 
in the system or is due to defective coordination, 
need not be considered here. 

The facts may be put in another way. In Eu- 
ropean countries schools are based on the existing 
social organization. The aim is to provide educa- 
tion for those youths who will pass out of school at 
thirteen or fourteen years of age, for those who will 
pass out of it at eighteen or nineteen, and for those 
who are destined for the higher institutions of in- 
struction. These pupils are not all taught together as 
far as the first class go, and the remainder are not 
all taught together as far as the second class go, but 
to a great extent are separate almost from the time 
that they go to school, and are taught with refer- 
ence to their supposed destination. All kinds of 
pupils may be taught together for the first three 
years, but this is not necessarily, or indeed com- 
monly, the case. This is what may be called the 
" three-pyramid plan " of organizing schools. " The 
three courses of instruction," says Dr. Fitch, " pri- 
mary, secondary, and higher, may be compared to

three pyramids of different sizes, though all in their 
way symmetrical and perfect ; but you cannot take 
the apex of the larger pyramid and set it on the 
top of the smaller. You may indeed fit on, with a 
certain practical convenience, the top of the higher 
scheme of education to the truncated system of the 
lower, provided you go low enough," etc. Our State 
school systems are organized on the one-pyramid 
plan. The comparative merits of the two plans for 
general purposes is a topic aside from the present 
purpose. But the three-pyramid plan has two ob- 
vious advantages. One is that courses of instruc- 
tion can be made out with sole reference to com- 
pleteness in themselves, and the other that the abler 
pupils, who are the ones destined for college as a 
rule, are put by themselves, and so can move, even 
in elementary studies, at their own natural rate of 
speed. How far our social conditions would justify 
an attempt to reorganize our schools on this plan, 
and how far studies that are now taught exclusively 
in the secondary schools can be brought down into 
the elementary grades, are very interesting ques- 
tions. For one, I look with confidence to the expe- 
riments now being made in the second direction. 

2. The teachers in the foreign schools, as a class, 
are superior to ours. They are better prepared to 
do their work, and they do it better. This prepara- 
tion includes better scholarship, more distinct ideals, 
and superior teaching ability. These teachers know 
just what is expected of them, and know they will 
be held responsible for the result. It is needless 
almost to refer to the fact that, as an average, they 
pursue their work for a much longer period of time 
than our teachers. 

3. National tone is a not unimportant factor in 
the question. The industrial, commercial, and po- 
litical tension of American society is the highest 
known in the world. In this respect we are keyed 
up to the highest note. But in science, philosophy, 
and literature that is, in the intellectual sphere 
proper our tension is distinctly lower than that 
of England, France, or Germany. The average 
intelligence may be as high in this country, or even 
higher, but our higher culture, so called, is of a 
lower grade. The high intellectual tension of the 
educated class abroad is felt in the schools. There 
now lies before me a description of a German gym- 
nasium written by a student of my acquaintance 
who passed through it, and I doubt whether there 
is a city in the United States where a school with 
such a regimen could be maintained. 

What has been said about general culture is par- 
ticularly applicable to the language-arts, speech, 
reading, and composition, which are a very delicate 
test of personal cultivation ; and I do not hesitate 
to avow the opinion that the relatively low standard 
of culture prevailing in the country, including teach- 
ers as well as pupils, is in large measure the cause 
of the low state of these arts in the schools. There 
is perhaps reason to think that the average cultiva- 
tion of college students, including English, is lower 
than it was fifty years ago. Were not college stu- 



dents a more select body then than they are now? 
Did they not better represent the highest cultivation 
of the country? Have not the great increase of 
wealth, the enormous material improvements that 
have been effected, and the growth of population, 
together with the democratizing of society, tended 
appreciably to make American college students, as a 
whole, a more heterogeneous class of persons? To 
my mind there is some reason for answering these 
questions in the affirmative. B. A. HINSDALE. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MR. LAURENCE IRVINQ'S NEW PLAY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The ethics of the drama is a subject which, in spite 
of the popularity of the stage from the days of ancient 
Greece down to our own time, has not become trite, for 
whenever the subject seems to have been worn thread- 
bare, some new play of more than passing merit brings 
the question again to the front. Such a drama is 
" Godefroi and Yolande." The highest function of the 
drama is to educate to be a moral factor in society. 
A play which is merely serving the ends of art may be 
very admirable in its way, but it is not rising to the 
highest privilege of the drama. Still, no objection could 
reasonably be made. But when the art of the drama 
is used to create a wrong moral effect, it is right to 
protest. Nothing is now said as to the morale of the 
play; that is not the matter in question. The point is, 
that when the stage holds the mirror up to history, and 
then does not reflect the facts of history but distorts 
the truth, it is perverting the legitimate purposes of 
the drama. The only exception can be in case of no 
moral complication in the event, or when the higher 
motive is conveyed through a species of moral me- 
tonymy or symbolism. If Mr. Laurence Irving, who 
is the author of " Godefroi and Yolande," intended the 
physical affliction of the beautiful courtesan to be sym- 
bolic of moral leprosy, then, perhaps, objection might be 
stayed ; but unfortunately such intention if it were 
intended is out-pointed by other issues of the drama. 

The plot of the play in question, which is laid in 
mediaeval France in the reign of Philippe le Bel (1285- 
1314) is briefly this: Yolande, a beautiful woman of 
the court, is loved by her secretary, Godefroi. But in 
an evil hour she is discovered to be a leper. This dis- 
covery is made by accident and in the presence of the 
king and his brother, who is an archbishop. A scene of 
consternation ensues. The unhappy woman is deserted by 
all her friends, even by her waiting-women, and is driven 
forth into the world with the curse of the king and the 
anathema of the Church upon her. Her lover, preferring 
a living death to life apart from her, follows her to join 
the unhappy ranks of the " unclean." The dramatic in- 
tensity, the almost obtrusive realism, so impress the be- 
holder that he is, unless he be upon his guard, likely to 
be filled with horror for an age so harsh. The Middle 
Ages were narrow, bigoted, intolerant, but this partic- 
ular form of intolerance cannot be charged against them. 
This conception of the attitude of the Middle Ages 
towards lepers is neither warranted by the facts of gen- 
eral history, nor by the particular episode upon which 
" Godefroi and Yolande " is based, and in the interest 
of truth the play ought not to pass without explanation. 

The immediate source whence the plot is derived is

an event related in the Grandes Chroniques de France for 
the year 1505 as follows:

Dieu dust en estre moult griefvement courrouce'. Ores il ad-

mesme maladie abhominable. Cecy advint pres Fontaine- 
bellant en Gastinois. Et quant ouyt le roy Philippe ceste ad- 
venture moult en estoyt esmerveille"."* 

This is a frail foundation upon which to base so elab- 
orate a movement. It might, however, be allowed, 
if no greater violence to history were done than this. 
But this is not the case, and it is for this reason that 
a positive wrong is inflicted. If " history is philosophy 
teaching by example," then ought we of to-day to profit 
by the teaching: because the men of that day were 
narrow, so ought we to be broad; because they were in- 
tolerant, so ought we to be tolerant; because they were 
bigoted, so ought we to be catholic. "Godefroi and 
Yolande" violates the moral facts of history, and 
the world cannot afford, even in the interests of art, to 
falsify such truths; moral ideas are too great and too 
potent to be translated to a lower plane, and this must 
needs be so in case of a drama founded upon history, in 
which the truth is sacrificed to art, for after all, art is 
artificial, truth is natural, and it is the truth that shall 
set us free. 

The mediaeval Church, far from anathematizing the 
leper-class, afforded them protection and support. The 
monasteries and convents were both hospitals and char- 
itable institutions, where the sick were cared for, or 
food and clothing distributed to the poor. In France 
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the number of 
charitable houses rapidly increased, not alone in the 
towns, but in the rural districts as well. The general 
movement which determined such foundations was es- 
sentially a religious one. Seigneurs, bishops, bourgeois, 
founded a house of God or a hospital for the safety of 
their souls. Such houses were generally erected near a 
church or by the gate of a monastery. Others, which en- 
joyed the role of an inn, were located along the grand 
routes of travel, by ferries or in mountain passes. When 
leprosy became prevalent in Western Europe, owing to 
the Crusades, special institutions for the accommodation 
of lepers were provided. Neither the Church nor the 
government was intolerant of them, but on the contrary 
looked to their comfort and protection more than in the 
case of other dependent classes. Louis le Gros in the 
twelfth century founded the leper-house of St. Lazarus, 
under the direction of the Bishop of Paris, which for 
centuries afterwards was favored by king and pope. The 
chronicles of the time afford many instances of the interest 
of kings in the welfare of lepers. Guillaume de Nangis, 
the biographer of St. Louis, tells of the good king's visit 
to a monk of the abbey of Royaumont who was a leper; 

*Mr. Swinburne has appropriated this episode in "The 
Leper," but the poet has conformed to the truth of history 
more than has the playright. 



the monastery of Bee, in Normandy, in the time of 
Anselm, was the retreat of a powerful noble of Flanders, 
who was suffering from leprosy. Louis VI. made no 
less than twelve grants of money or of land for the sup- 
port of leper colonies. In 1201 Philip Augustus legis- 
lated in favor of the lepers of Meulan and Corbeil, and 
instances might be multiplied of kings so doing in En- 
gland and Italy also. St. Francis established two leper 
hospitals, and their betterment was an avowed object of 
the Order. To wash the feet of lepers, in the Middle 
Ages, was considered to be an act of supreme self- 
humiliation. To one acquainted with the character of 
mediaeval thought this is not strange. Everything in 
that day was looked at from the point of view of the 
Church. In the eyes of the men of that time lepers were 
pauperes Christi Christ's poor, the heirs of the afflic- 
tion of the Lazarus of Christ's parable, whose malady 
as that of Job also the popular idea confounded 
with leprosy. The extent to which this conception was 
carried may be appreciated when the reader is made 
aware that in the mediaeval version, Isaiah 53:4, " We 
did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted," 
is rendered, " Nos putavimus Eum leprosum, percussum 
a Deo et humiliatum." 

Throughout the Middle Ages, we find Church and 
government cooperating in the interest of lepers. As 
beggers they were a privileged class, recognized by 
royal writ, while ordinary beggars were proscribed. 
There are instances in which lepers were confounded 
with the Jews, and persecuted accordingly; a notable 
case of this sort was in the reign of Philip VI., but this 
occurrence was an exception and not the rule. Acts 
against lepers were ordinarily dictated by sanitary con- 
siderations, and were not the result of popular prejudice. 

Miss Terry cannot afford to sanction with the seal of 
her art a work which conveys so unjust an impression. 
" Godefroi and Yolande " is based upon a fundamental 
error, and that a moral misconception. The mediaeval 
Church, for all its imperfections and evil, was quite the 
grandest institution that the world has ever seen in ideal 
conception, in breadth of application, in efficiency of 
administration. If it be true, as Young said, that " The 
course of Nature is the art of God," then the cultiva- 
tion of truth should be the practice of men. Every crea- 
tion is the product of a development from the low to 
the high, from the general to the special, from the plain 
to the complex. The true lesson of the drama, as it is 
of life, is a lesson of moral evolution.

at least two modern reprints, viz., in No. IV. of Warnke 
and Proescholdt's Pseudo-Shakespearian Plays (Halle, 
1887), and in Delius' Pseudo-Shakspere' sche Dramen 
(Elberfeld, 1856). " The Misfortunes of Arthur " may 
be consulted not only in Collier's " Five Old Plays," but

"A CRISIS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

I have been much interested in your editorial, " A 
Crisis in Public Education," in THE DIAL for March 16, 
and while I recognize in it much that is true, some 
statements are made to which I cannot subscribe. Pass- 
ing its mere local reference to school affairs in Chicago, 
with which I am not familiar, let us examine some of 
its more general statements. 

You suggest that " when educational affairs become 
a subject of popular discussion, it is nearly always found 
that a certain undercurrent of narrow and prejudiced 
or ignorant thought comes to the surface, and has con- 
siderable influence in shaping the final decision. The 
newspapers may too often be counted upon to lead the 
attack upon whatever is most valuable in a public-school 
system." 

It may be conceded that "narrow," " prejudiced," and 
" ignorant thought," when it enters the domain of pub- 
lic affairs, is always unfortunate, prima facie. But I 
shall contend that it is far better to have this so than 
to shut off the " popular discussion " of any question 
pertaining to public matters in whatever branch of our 
government. For what is a Democracy without such 
" discussions " ? It should be the particular business of 
the broad-minded, unprejudiced, and wise to see that 
" the final decision " is not so " shaped " as to unfavor- 
ably affect the largest and best interests of the public. 
The fact that the latter are more fully and completely 
in touch with all phases of the question under discussion 
ought to assure them an easy victory. 

I cannot believe that, as a rule, " newspapers lead in 
the attack upon whatever is most valuable in a public- 
school system." Indeed, I am of the firm faith that the 
very reverse is true, as a rule. I am aware that the 
political press is guilty of enough mistakes, but I do 
not believe that one of its sins is that charged in the 
foregoing remark. I have in mind several instances 
where newspapers took the initiative in effecting gen- 
uine school reform, and this was done, in some cases, in 
the very face of a strong adverse sentiment. I believe 
the friends of public education have less to fear from 
the intelligently conducted newspaper than they have 
from a large number of their own class, who may be 
sincere and honest, but are impractical, over-zealous, and 
ofttimes " narrow." 

You say that one of the chief points of popular attack 
is upon the salaries paid for the higher kinds of work 
in the public schools. And you add that it is an " illus- 
tration of an intellectual defect that seems inherent in 
democracy, of the inability to understand why one man's 
services should be so much more valuable than an- 
other's." 

There is some truth in the comments you offer on this 
question. But it is not the whole truth. In my judg- 
ment, " higher kinds " of educational work can be and 
are often done in the very lowest and primary grades 
of school work. And this " higher kind of school work " 
should be paid accordingly, because of the high quality 
of the work performed. But "a graduated tax," which 
you justly term "insidious" and "most dangerous," 
makes such compensation impossible. I am one who 
should be glad to see, and will hail with supreme satis- 
faction, the day when the largest excellence and the 
greatest proficiency is attained in the lower grades of 
school work. For this is that part of our public school 
system nearest to the masses; is the part most used by 



the largest numbers; and is, in an especial sense, the 
particular school for the people and the whole people. 
It is fit that for the highest excellence in the instruc- 
tional force in this particular field the compensation 
should be commensurate with the work. 

DUANE MOWRY. 

Milwaukee j March 18, 1896. 

[We did not assert, or intend to imply, that the 
" higher kind of school work " is done solely in the 
teaching of the older pupils. It may, as you say, 
be done anywhere in the course. Nor did we say 
that, " as a rule," newspapers attack what is best 
in a school system. We said that they " may too 
often he counted upon " to do so. In Chicago, they 
have done it over and over again, with a disastrous 
effect upon public opinion. For example, in dis- 
cussing the very editorial upon which you comment, 
they have treated it as if it were mainly a defence 
of the high school, whereas it is so only incidentally ; 
then, having produced this false impression, they 
have deliberately suppressed the leading argument 
for the high schools, which is that these schools pro- 
vide the teachers in the lower schools with nearly 
all the pedagogical training they get before enter- 
ing upon their profession. EDBS. DIAL.] 



"THE MIDSUMMER OF ITALIAN ART." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read Mr. G. B. Rose's criticisms on my book 
in your issue for March 1, and I trust you will accord 
me a sufficient space in self-defence. 

Dr. Johnson once said to Boswell: "If I tell you 
there are no apples in that orchard, and there comes a 
prying fellow who finds half a dozen on different trees, 
he does not, for all that, controvert my statement." 
The experience of Macaulay, Freeman, Carlyle, Emer- 
son, and Matthew Arnold, besides a host of lesser writ- 
ers, would seem to prove that it is impossible to write 
history and biography without making mistakes in mat- 
ters of fact. Among the host of lesser writers we shall 
be obliged to place Mr. Rose, who has made more mis- 
takes in his short letter to THE DIAL than I believe 
can be found in three hundred pages of my book on the 
great masters; but even if his statement were all cor- 
rect, they are of such an unimportant kind that the won- 
der is that he should have wasted ink and paper upon 
them. 

In the first place, he considers my criticism of the 
Miraculous Draft of Fishes, that is, that the boat is 
too near the shore for catching sizable fish, as a sin- 
gular limitation on our Lord's miraculous powers. Now, 
I do not question the power of Christ to make fish walk 
out of the water ; but the problem is, where were 
Christ's disciples likely to cast their nets. If they had 
expected a miracle, or any exceptional occurrence, would 
Peter have said, " Lord I am a miserable sinner." To 
make a mistake of fact is one thing; to try to prove a 
mistake of fact by a flimsy and sophistical argument is 
quite another thing. 

Mr. Rose states that the windows of the Antecollegio 
in the Ducal palace look out on a court-yard, and that 
the Adriatic is not visible from them. One would doubt, 
from this, if Mr. Rose had ever been in Venice. The 
windows of the Antecollegio look out on the piazetta, and 
there is nothing between them and the Lido. As all the 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



199 



buildings on that side are on a line with the Ducal pal- 
ace, the reader will perceive that some small portion of 
the Adriatic must be visible from it. 

Mr. Rose's supposition that the statue called II Pen- 
seroso was a portrait of Lorenzo dei Medici is an old 
error that was corrected by Professor Grimm thirty 
years ago. If he will examine Grimm's Life of Michel 
Angelo he will find a full explanation of the matter, and 
the conclusive reasons for the true facts of the case. 

After refuting two such blunders, why should I take 
time to make any further reply to Mr. Rose ? I am 
ready to admit, however, that I may be somewhat in 
error with regard to Raphael's Disputa. That and the 
Madonna of the Grand Duke are two important pic- 
tures which I happened to overlook. Of late years the 
works of art in Italian cities have been greatly changed 
about. I can obtain the testimony of many witnesses to 
prove that Leonardo's Medusa was formerly in the Tri- 
buna. In regard to the David of Michel Angelo, I have 
only said that about twenty years ago the statue was 
placed within the Palazzo Vecchio for its better pre- 
servation. This is the truth, and who can tell what the 
Italian government will do with it next ? Neither have 
I stated that one of Michel Angelo's Captives is in the 
Boboli gardens. I said it was there formerly; and if 
Mr. Rose will look in Black's biography of Angelo he 
will find a corroboration of my statement. 

" My lords, I am amazed at the attack the noble duke 
has made upon me." Why should a man in Arkansas 
feel such a lively animosity against a man in Massa- 
chusetts, whom he has never seen, and in regard to a 
subject four thousand miles away ? We fly to art and 
poetry to escape the disagreeableness of politics in prac- 
tical affairs. There cannot be anything in my book that 
has so excited Mr. Rose's ire. 

" The Midsummer of Italian Art " was purchased by 
the National Library of Florence, at the suggestion of 
an Italian scholar, before I was aware that the book was 
for sale in Italy. I can assure Mr. Rose that not one 
word of my book was written in a New England village.

THE DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATION AT 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Your suggestive editorial on " A University Sympo- 
sium " in THE DIAL (Feb. 16) assumes perhaps a little 
too readily that the solution of our educational prob- 
lem, in the matter of administration, must come through 
the adaptation of the college idea, or not at all. Is it 
not quite possible that American experience may strike 
out some wholly new idea, which shall provide for us a 
much better system than any form of old world organ- 
ization can give ? Many of us believe that Leland Stan- 
ford Junior University is working out an experiment 
along that line full of significance for the future. 

The organization of this institution rests on two prin- 
ciples. In the first place, the unit of organization is the 
department. The courses of study are wholly elective. 
Each student, however, must elect one branch of learn- 
ing as his major subject. And that election at once 
fixes his relations to the university. The department 
in which he takes his major study becomes the centre 
of all his work; his " major professor " is his chief ad- 
viser, and has large discretion in shaping his course of 
study and overseeing his interests in all respects. Thus 
the department stands for the student in the place of a 



college. He graduates from the department, as the 
English university man from his college. And so far 
as can be seen, the system conserves every good ele- 
ment of the English system, while it avoids many of 
the dangers inherent in the college plan. The personal 
relations between teacher and student are most direct 
and intimate. There is no waste of forces through du- 
plication of equipment or instruction. There is no need 
to parcel out endowments, since the department in its 
entirety is but an integral factor of the whole university. 
There is no weakening of loyalty to the university. 
The gain, through the unity thus imparted to the stu- 
dent's course, through the sponsorship which the depart- 
ment exercises on his behalf, is very great. 

The other fundamental principle of the system here 
in force is the creation of a genuine university spirit 
through the use of administrative committees drawn 
from all departments. All questions of policy and dis- 
cipline and outside relations fall into the hands of such 
committees. Through their activities, as well as through 
other means, department keeps in touch with depart- 
ment, and a strong sense of oneness is created. 

The time is perhaps yet too short to predict the pos- 
sibilities of this system, but its practical workings thus 
far tend to make those acquainted with it very sanguine. 
It is doubtful if any institution in the land with an en- 
rollment of a thousand students operates so smoothly 
and satisfactorily. Many believe that this experiment 
points out the most feasible lines of progress for the 
future administrative system of the American university.

BALLADE. 

quaint Ballade, I wonder why 
Such toil it is to fashion thee! 

By dainty twist and turn I try 

To make the sense and sound agree; 
But rhymes are birds, and often flee 

When most we think them in the snare: 
Return, O winged words, to me, 

And sweetly sing and fleetly fare! 

1 watch the stars that walk the sky, 
They tell of bright eternity; 

The eerie shadows brush me by, 
I marvel what their trend may be; 
A brief breeze startles yonder tree, 

Of lisp of leaf I am aware : 
Come, cadence crisp and silvery, 

And sweetly sing and fleetly fare! 

I wander where the waves are nigh, 

And list the voices of the sea; 
The vivid plunging billows ply 

The shining shores in foamy glee; 

To win a sudden simile, 
I note the white gull cleave the air: 

O flitting thoughts, be fond and free, 
And sweetly sing and fleetly fare! 

ENVOY. 

I woo the vast, the weird, the wee; 

More, dear Ballade, I may not dare : 
My farewell take for final fee, 

And sweetly sing and fleetly fare!

Two VIEWS or BISMARCK.* 



Two volumes before us, Mr. Lowe's " Bis- 
marck's Table Talk " and " Studies in Diplo- 
macy," from the French of Count Benedetti, 
interesting in themselves, are doubly interest- 
ing when read together, for they interpret the 
history of the last third of a century from ex- 
actly opposite points of view. Each author 
makes Bismarck the central figure in that his- 
tory, his brain and craft the source of the plans 
that have led Europe into three wars, created 
a German nation, brought about one combina- 
tion after another on the diplomatic chess- 
board. But while one sees in him not only 
genius and success but also a beneficent patriot 
and friend of peace and civilization, the other 
sees in him the evil genius of Europe whose 
dark ambition and selfish craft have needlessly 
caused the death of tens of thousands of men, 
and brought upon not only Germany but all 
the nations of the Continent the burdens be- 
neath which they are staggering to-day, the tax- 
ation and militarism that are crushing their 
peoples. 

Mr. Lowe's volume is a selection from the 
four bulky volumes of Bismarck's table-talk by 
Herr von Poschinger, edited and annotated. It 
follows the lines of his biographies of Bismarck, 
from the chancellor's boyhood to his fall in 
1890. Another volume is promised which will 
contain the complaints, criticisms, and revela- 
tions of the dethroned statesman. Bismarck 
has been a famous talker. His intense mental 
activity and unbounded confidence in his own 
opinions, his keen observation and insight, his 
high position and great success, his cynical 
frankness, and his impulse to the free expres- 
sion of whatever was in his mind, have made 
his conversation full of interest and individu- 
ality. Rarely has his table been without guests, 
and as rarely have his guests departed without 
some new insight into public affairs and into 
their host's many-sided genius. Like the con- 
versation of other great talkers, Bismarck's was 
more a monologue than an interchange of 
thought, a sparkling, rippling stream of fact, 
thought, fancy, and wit. As he himself said

of Metternich, one needed only to jog the bell 
occasionally to keep it ringing. 

Some of Bismarck's judgments of his con- 
temporaries are interesting. Of Gladstone he 
said that he had so long played with words that 
now the words played with him ; and at another 
time, that if, in the course of his whole life, he 
had inflicted upon Germany half the ignoring 
and weakness which Mr. Gladstone inflicted 
upon England in the course of four years, he 
would not have had the courage to look his 
countrymen in the face again. Of Napoleon 
III. he said : " He was not lacking in intelli- 
gence, but this intelligence wanted edge. He 
possessed a source of great power an unshak- 
able belief in himself, in his star. He deemed 
himself equal to anything, and brooded over 
the most fantastic schemes." Gambetta he 
spoke of as "this briefless barrister, whose 
whole political outfit consists of some coffee- 
house cackle and three Chamber speeches 
stuffed with liberal phrases." " Of professors 
in politics Bismarck had a holy horror. ' You 
must not take me for a Heidelberg professor,' 
he once said to Prince Napoleon." He once 
restrained a guest from refuting one of these 
gentlemen. " Pray do n't trouble yourself ; if 
you will only have patience for two or three 
minutes, the learned Herr Professor will con- 
tradict himself in the most brilliant manner." 
And the history of Germany shows that he as 
a practical statesman was not without reason 
in regarding the professors as impracticable 
idealists. 

Bismarck, in his moments of depression, pro- 
tested his hatred for politics, though it is evi- 
dent that politics was his passion throughout 
his active life. " I never thought that in my 
riper years I should be obliged to carry on such 
an unworthy trade as that of Parliamentary 
Minister. I have come down in the world, I 
hardly know how." And late in life he lamented 
that he had found but small pleasure or satis- 
faction from his political activity. " Had it 
not been for me, there would have been three 
great wars the less, the lives of eighty thousand 
men would not have been sacrificed ; and many 
parents, brothers, sisters, and widows, would 
not now be mourners. That, however, I have 
settled with my Maker." Though one can 
hardly conceive it possible, he often expressed 
a longing for the work of the soldier rather than 
that of the civilian. 

He is a thorough believer in monarchy. Uni- 
versal suffrage he once described as " the gov- 
ernment of a house by its nursery," adding,

"You can do anything with children if you 
only play with them." It is evident that he 
could not have done what he did if he had been 
fine-grained and sensitive, yet the coarse bully- 
ing to which he has often resorted in his treat- 
ment of individuals, of weaker states and their 
diplomatic representatives, and of the repre- 
sentatives of the people in Parliament, necessa- 
rily take from our respect for his character. 
Nor has his career been free from vulgar deceit, 
to say nothing of the deep craft bordering on 
deceit that has characterized his whole inter- 
national policy. One cannot but join in Bene- 
detti's denunciation, rather than in Bismarck's 
chuckles of satisfaction, in the matter of the 
garbling of King William's despatch that pre- 
cipitated the Franco-Prussian War. Yet his 
craftiness often took the form of the frankest 
truth-telling, so frank and so opposite to all the 
traditions of diplomacy that his rivals deceived 
themselves. " What danger can there be in a 
man who notoriously thinks aloud?" Louis 
Napoleon once exclaimed ; to which reply was 
made, " Count Bismarck has a genius for con- 
veying false impressions by telling the naked 
truth. His frankness is like the inky fluid 
which the cuttle-fish at Biarritz throw round 
them the more truthful he is, the less one 
sees into him." His pride in success won by 
a policy tainted by duplicity is seen in this re- 
mark : "When I was made a Prince the King 
insisted on putting Alsace-Lorraine into my 
coat-of-arms. But I would much rather have 
had Schleswig-Holstein, for that is the cam- 
paign, politically speaking, of which I am 
proudest." 

Count Benedetti's account of Bismarck's 
career is bitterly hostile, that of a man with a 
grievance. But though biased by personal as 
well as national hostility, it gives a wholesome 
view of the opposite side to which it is easy to 
be blinded by the splendid successes of Bis- 
marck's policy. And the French diplomatist 
has a right to his grievance. He was the im- 
mediate victim of the garbling of the above- 
mentioned despatch, for he was made to appear 
a bungler and to have brought about the breach 
by his bungling, while he seems to have carried 
out skilfully instructions from Paris of which 
he did not approve and which his superiors 
afterwards declined to acknowledge. The 
" Studies in Diplomacy " are five in number. 
The first is in the form of a preface, but is 
really a long and elaborate piece of invective 
against Prince Bismarck as the cause of most 
of the evils that press upon Europe, in having 



violently overthrown the old and natural rela- 
tions between the states, and having arrayed 
them in hostile and suspicious groups, making 
necessary the military burdens they are now 
carrying. "False," "perfidious," "intrigue," 
" far-sighted duplicity," " morality in tears," 
are some of the expressions he applies to Will- 
iam and Bismarck and their policy. The sec- 
ond study is entitled " The Emperor and Prince 
Bismarck," and here he tries to show, " simply 
in the interest of historical truth," that it was 
William and not Bismarck, after all, that was 
the supreme director of Prussian policy, that 
at critical moments he overruled his chancellor. 
He attacks what he calls the legend that Bis- 
marck devised and controlled everything, while 
his gentle and generous sovereign only ap- 
proved his plans. " Have not contemporaries 
been deceived by the clangorous clatter of the 
one, by the impenetrable silence of the other ? 
Will not impartial history give the Sovereign 
a share equal to that of the Chancellor, if not 
greater ? " It may be interesting here to quote 
Bismarck's opinion of Benedetti as a " dancing 
dog without a collar," " I am scarcely sure of 
my life with this rabid Corsican." " But in 
saying this he gave a smile," said the narrator, 
and we too broke out into a laugh when we 
thought of a northern oak of our Chancellor's 
calibre being in danger from a little Italian 
cactus." 

The next two of the studies are really upon 
the same subject, " The Triple Alliance " and 
"The Armed Peace and Its Consequences." 
" The Triple Alliance is a deed of defiance and 
hatred ; facts prove this superabundantly at 
present. It will produce what it has had 
within it in germ since its origin: ruin or 
war, perhaps both scourges together. If those 
who formed it, or who have become its guard- 
ians, are not convinced, it is because Jupiter 
has turned them silly in order to chastise them 
the better." The last study, " My Mission to 
Ems," is a dignified personal vindication from 
the charges of diplomatic mismanagement and 
incompetency under which the author has suf- 
fered. These have become a commonplace of 
the history which has been written in English 
from the German standpoint. Incidentally we 
have a vivid account of the events that imme- 
diately preceded the outbreak of the war.

EAKL.Y WRITING IN CRETE 
NEIGHBORING LANDS.* 



Mr. Arthur J. Evans's "Cretan Picto- 
graphs " consists of two distinct and not very 
closely related essays. The former (pp. 1-103) 
is reprinted from the "Journal of Hellenic 
Studies" for 1894. The latter is now published 
for the first time. 

The object of the principal essay is to prove 
that there once existed in Crete a system of 
hieroglyphic writing, which can be traced back 
to as early as 2500 B.C.; and that a system 
of linear signs, probably developed from the 
hieroglyphic, was extensively used, not merely 
in Crete, but in Peloponnesus and elsewhere, 
during the period of the " Mycenaean " civili- 
zation, which civilization was at its height, 
according to the author's chronology, about 
1500 B.C. 

The great importance of this essay may best 
be brought out by first summarizing the pre- 
vious state of opinion on the subject with which 
it deals. With regard to picture-writing, the 
passage in the Sixth Book of the " Iliad " which 
tells how Bellerophon was sent from Ephyre 
(Corinth) to Lycia with a tablet containing 
" fatal signs," sometimes gave occasion for the 
remark that a mode of communication anal- 
ogous to that in use among the North Amer- 
ican Indians may have been known in Homeric 
times ; but nobody professed to be able to point 
to any specimen of such picture-writing. With 
regard to alphabetic writing, the conviction 
was until lately universal that no such thing 
existed in Greek lands before the introduction 
of the Phoenician characters. Then attention 
began to be called to marks, suggestively like 
letters in appearance, incised on objects of very 
early date in the ^Egean region. In an appen- 
dix to Schliemann's " Ilios," published toward 
the end of 1880, Professor Sayce attempted to 
show that certain marks on terra-cotta whorls 
from Hissarlik were syllabic characters. Early 
in 1881 our countryman, Mr. W. J. Stillman, 
probably still unaware of Professor Sayce's the- 
ory, observed and copied a series of six marks 
inscribed on the walls of a pre-historic build- 
ing on the site of the ancient Cnosus in Crete. 
But, while in doubt as to the significance of 
these characters, Mr. Stillman thought that 
they belonged " to a period prior to the use

of letters or any complete system of numeral 
record." His brief account of the matter, pub- 
lished in the Second Annual Report of the 
Archaeological Institute of America, seems to 
have attracted little attention. Within the last 
four or five years, the discovery of similar signs 
on objects of " Mycenaean " date has led to 
more remark. Dr. Tsountas, the scholarly and 
sagacious Greek explorer, in his valuable vol- 
ume on Mycenae (Athens, 1893), publishes two 
vase-handles, on one of which are incised three 
characters resembling letters, on the other four 
or five. In connection with these and other 
less striking examples from Greece, as well as 
with marks observed by Mr. Petrie on pottery 
found by him at Gurob and Kahun in Egypt, 
but believed to have been imported from the 
islands or coasts of the 2Egean, Mr. Tsountas 
raised the question whether a system of writ- 
ing existed in " Mycenaean " times ; but he 
thought that the facts then known did not favor 
an affirmative answer. Finally, with all the 
evidence then available before him, M. Perrot, 
in the latest volume of his great history of an- 
cient art ("La Grece Primitive," Paris, 1894), 
declared : " The first characteristic which at- 
tracts the historian's notice when he tries to de- 
fine the pre-Homeric civilization is that it is a 
stranger to the use of writing. It knows neither 
the ideographic signs possessed by Egypt nor 
the alphabet properly so called which Greece 
was afterward to borrow from Phoenicia" 
(quoted and translated by Mr. Evans). 

The above account will give a sufficient no- 
tion of the state of opinion at the time Mr. 
Evans began the researches which have re- 
sulted in the present volume. He is the keeper 
of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and is 
not only a scholar of wide and thorough learn- 
ing in the field of archaeology, but also a keen- 
scented collector and an intrepid explorer. He 
says : 

" In the course of a visit to Greece in the spring of 
1893, I came across some three- and four-sided stones 
perforated along their axis, upon which had been en- 
graved a series of remarkable symbols. These symbols 
occurred in groups on the facets of the stones, and it 
struck me at once that they belonged to a hieroglyphic 
system. . . . My inquiries succeeded in tracing these 
to a Cretan source." 

The next thing was to follow up the clue by 
searching for additional specimens in Crete 
itself. 

" Landing at Candia in March, 1894, 1 made my way 
round the whole centre and east of the island, includ- 
ing the mountainous districts of Ida and Dikta, the ex- 
tensive central plain of Messara, and the sites of over 
twenty ancient cities. . . . My researches were well

rewarded by the discovery in situ of traces of a prse- 
Phceuician system of writing in the island, in which two 
distinct phases were perceptible, one pictorial and hiero- 
glyphic, the other linear and quasi-alphabetic." 

The evidence thus gathered is presented in the 
copiously illustrated essay now before us, to- 
gether with kindred evidence from other 
sources. 

Mr. Evans has unquestionably established 
his main contentions. And what makes his 
results the more important is that, while the 
hieroglyphic system " seems to have been prin- 
cipally at home in Crete," the linear system 
can already be seen to have had a wide exten- 
sion in the " Mycenaean " world. The chief- 
tains, then, who built and occupied in the sec- 
ond millennium before the Christian era the 
palaces of Tiryns and Mycenae, were not with- 
out means of written communication and record. 
The specimens of script in use in their time will 
surely accumulate, as new sites come to be ex- 
cavated. But whether the material will be such 
as to enable some future Champollion to de- 
cipher the inscriptions, it is impossible now to 
predict. 

Mr. Evans further makes it highly probable 
that the " Mycenaean " linear system of writing 
stands in close connection with the syllabary 
in use in historic times among the Greeks of 
Cyprus. More than this, he re-opens the ques- 
tion of the origin of the Phrenician alphabet, 
that prolific mother of all alphabets now in use 
save the Chinese and Indian (Hindoo), if in- 
deed the Indian be an exception. According 
to the theory most in vogue, the Phoenician 
alphabet was derived from Egypt ; but Mr. 
Evans shows by a few examples that "it is at 
least worth while to weigh the possibility that 
the rudiments of the Phoenician writing may 
after all have come in part at least from the 
-ZEgean side." 

Here are matters enough for further study. 
Other workers will doubtless enter the field 
opened up by Mr. Evans, but he will always 
have the distinction of having been the chief 
pioneer. It may be mentioned, as a matter of 
special interest to Americans, that Professor 
Halbherr, the eminent Italian epigraphist who 
conducted explorations in Crete for the Ar- 
chaeological Institute of America from Novem- 
ber, 1893, to November, 1894, promises to de- 
vote a chapter to "Island Stones and other 
Stones inscribed with Writing belonging to a 
pre-Hellenic System," in the account of his re- 
searches to be published in " The American 
Journal of Archaeology." 



The second essay in Mr. Evans's volume 
deals with a group of objects found near the 
site of the ancient Phsestos in central Crete, 
and believed to date from the third millennium 
B.C. These are discussed with the author's 
usual learning and ingenuity.

A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY.* 

The fourth volume of Professor Traill's " So- 
cial England" covers the period of Stuart 
supremacy and of the struggle which placed on 
the throne of England a distinctively constitu- 
tional monarch. It was a century of religious 
as well as political contest. Yet in the end the 
change in English life was social rather than 
either religious or political. The two opposing 
forces, Catholic tradition and Puritan earnest- 
ness, were contending within the arena of 
church life, and the two opposing forces of abso- 
lutism and the desire for popular government 
were at the same time at war in the political 
sphere (p. 41). But the important influence 
lying behind the success of popular rights and 
the growth of religious freedom was the power 
of industry and commerce. The heroic age of 
English exploration and discovery was followed 
by one of settlement and trading progress, when 
the nation of Raleigh and the Pilgrim Fathers 
becomes a great colonizing state, and begins 
the foundation of what was to be the United 
States of America (p. 51). Progress in man- 
ufactures and in commerce, in banking and 
expanding trade, made possible both the Com- 
monwealth and the Revolution of 1688. 

A great social change had been taking place 
in England. The overthrow of the Stuarts is 
therefore to be regarded as something more 
than the fall of a dynasty. It represents in a 
striking manner the fundamental change in 
social institutions, and revealed the entirely dif- 
ferent basis of political power which the expan- 
sion of commerce, the growth of manufactures, 
and the increase of colonization had brought. 
The sovereignty and divine right of the king, 
dependent on the landed aristocracy and the 
church for support, is replaced by the sover- 
eignty and divine right of the people, and in- 
stead of the feudal idea of monarchy there arose 
the notion of constitutional royalty, dependent 
on the will of the people.

Interest naturally centres in the period be- 
tween the meeting of Parliament in November, 
1640, and the execution of the King in Janu- 
ary, 1649, a time in which the constitutional 
position of the Crown and its relation to Par- 
liament passed through startling phases. The 
Long Parliament began its work by abolishing 
the exceptional powers conferred temporarily 
on the Tudors to enable them to complete the 
overthrow of the mediaeval nobility, to carry 
through the struggle with Rome, to maintain 
order at home, and to avert the risk of foreign 
invasion : particularly the Star Chamber's 
power to sentence without a jury, and the power 
by extra customs duties to raise a revenue with- 
out Parliament. It then asked the King to 
appoint " such ministers as Parliament could 
confide in," and to accept the " course that the 
Lords and Commons have appointed for the 
ordering of the militia." But the scheme was 
at once too tolerant, too democratic, and too 
balanced, for an age of religious hatreds, of 
aristocratic and bourgeois prejudices, and of 
unfitness for delicate political machinery. In 
Stuart times the feudal monarchy had ceased 
to perform the social function required of it ; it 
had ceased to be useful to the English people. 
It was therefore destined to disappear. But if 
the members of the Stuart family, on the one 
hand, were not equal to the task of yielding just 
enough to the new movement, and adapting 
themselves to the new social environment, it is 
equally true that the religious enthusiasts and 
political leaders of " the third estate," on the 
other hand, were decidedly premature in many 
of their schemes and demands. James the First 
may have been weak to the point of childish- 
ness ; " have loved bawbles as a child loves its 
rattle ; loved bright feathers, too to dress his 
cap withal ; have been afraid of a drawn sword 
and of hobgoblins," and besides have chosen as 
his sole confidants greedy, unscrupulous adven- 
turers (p. 157). His son, Charles I., may have 
had an obstinate temper and absurd notions 
about his kingly prerogative. James the Sec- 
ond may have been as bigoted and obstinate as 
Charles the Second was profligate and suave. 
Yet on the other hand the extreme character 
of the demands and programme of the Puritans 
and the Republicans had everything to do with 
rendering the Civil War " inevitable." Much 
of the work proposed under the Commonwealth 
remained even to the present century to be 
accomplished, in the Reform Bill of 1832, 
Catholic emancipation, and so forth. 

Before the end of the reign of Charles II. 



arbitrary taxation had ceased and the respon- 
sibility of ministers been finally established. 
The Habeas Corpus act protected the liberty 
of the individual, and no army could be kept in 
time of peace. The reign, too, had witnessed 
the growth of the House of Commons. Its 
right of impeachment had been recognized, the 
principles of appropriation, of supply, and audit 
of accounts, had been secured, while its claims 
to initiate money bills had been placed beyond 
dispute (p. 351). The right of petition, the 
right of freedom of debate in Parliament, the 
necessity of frequent parliaments, the right of 
free choice of representatives, were hencefor- 
ward recognized. The Revolution of 1688 com- 
pleted the work of the Long Parliament, and 
the Bill of Rights confirmed the advantages 
gained by the nation during the great Rebellion. 
But the reigns of William and his successor, 
Anne, only saw the new system thoroughly in- 
augurated ; it was not until the reigns of the 
first two Georges that it was firmly established. 

It is the character of these social and polit- 
ical changes which give the period special inter- 
est to Americans. Much that we take for 
granted as the basis of our democratic institu- 
tions was worked out in the bourgeois revolution 
in England in the seventeenth century. Pro- 
gress was distinctly confined, however, to the 
middle class. The vast majority of the popu- 
lation gained little, either in wealth or freedom. 
Tenant-farmers and yeoman freeholders, as well 
as merchant traders, were growing rich ; but 
the lot of the agricultural laborer did not change 
for the better. Wages rose no faster than the 
prices of the necessaries of life. The agrarian 
partnerships of open village farms, where the 
enterprise of twenty farmers might be checked 
by the apathy or caution of one, were giving 
place to large estates and individual ownership ; 
but markets were few, communication difficult, 
and traditional methods were guarded as agri- 
cultural heirlooms. Each village was self- 
sufficing, raised only enough food for its own 
inhabitants, and was not concerned with the 
affairs of the next parish. It was not until the 
new body of wants and a new market had been 
created by the rapid growth of population which 
resulted from the development of manufactur- 
ing industries, that there was any improve- 
ment in the condition of the masses and increase 
in their political power. 

Consideration of this last fact naturally sug- 
gests the query as to whether Mr. Traill and 
his co-laborers are really making " Social En- 
gland " " a record of the progress of the peo-

pie." If nearly five-sixths of the total popu- 
lation of the country in 1688 were dependent, 
either directly or indirectly, on the land (p. 
445) ; or if Gregory King was approximately 
correct in his estimate of class divisions (nobil- 
ity and gentry, 16,600 ; merchants, clergy, 
lawyers, civil service each profession 10,000 
40,000 ; " liberal arts," 15,000 ; officers of 
army and navy, 9,000) which gives a total of 
less than 100,000 in a population of 5,000,- 
000 ; and if the total revenue of the clergy, 
500,000 (p. 475), did not equal the profit on 
foreign trade, why not say less of church and 
state, of literature, art, and architecture, and 
say a good deal more about the home life of 
the people, their hours of work and means of 
pleasure, their food and drink, house decora- 
tion, and so forth ? Do not these things reveal 
the progress of the people ?

ance exceeds any anticipation in which we had in- 
dulged, so large is the amount and so noble the qual- 
ity of the collection of pieces now brought together 
by the painstaking devotion of the only surviving 
brother of the poet. Once more we are impressed 
with the fact that Christina Rossetti was, if not dis- 
tinctly the first, assuredly not the second among 
Englishwomen dowered with the gift of numbers, 
and once more we are called upon to seek for terms 
that shall not be entirely inadequate to express the 
gratitude which all lovers of poetry must feel toward 
the singer of so many perfect songs. Mr. Rossetti 
has here brought together, partly from the manu- 
scripts left by his sister, and partly from published 
sources not readily accessible, nearly four hundred 
pages of verse, ranging from the earliest juvenilia 
to the maturest and most spiritual expression of her 
genius. Some of the poems stand upon the highest 
plane of her achievement ; others are simply beau- 
tiful without being noteworthy; a few are of the 
nature of exercises in verse or attempts at flight ere 
the wings were grown. The collection as a whole 
is an unspeakably precious and fragrant gift, a per- 
manent enrichment of our literature. Miss Ros- 
setti's genius was astonishingly precocious in devel- 
opment, and there is no better work in this or in 
the earlier volumes than some of that dating from 
her girlhood. The following beautiful if irregular 
sonnet, " Life Hidden," was written at the age of 
nineteen : 

" Roses and lilies grow above the place 

Where she sleeps the long sleep that doth not dream. 
If we could look upon her hidden face, 

Nor shadow would be there, nor garish gleam 

Of light, her life is lapsing like a stream 
That makes no noise but floweth on apace 

Seawards, while many a shade and shady beam 
Vary the ripples in their gliding chase. 
She doth not see, but knows ; she doth not feel, 

And yet is sensible ; she hears no sound, 

Yet counts the flight of time and doth not err. 
Peace far and near, peace to ourselves and her : 

Her body is at peace in holy ground, 
Her spirit is at peace where Angels kneel." 

Dated only four years later is this exquisite set of 
couplets, " Whitsun Eve," a symphony in white : 

" The white dove cooeth in her downy nest, 
Keeping her young ones warm beneath her breast : 
The white moon saileth through the cool clear sky, 
Screened by a tender mist in passing by : 
The white rose buds, with thorns upon its stem, 
All the more precious and more dear for them : 
The stream shines silver in the tufted grass, 
The white clouds scarcely dim it as they pass ; 
Deep in the valleys lily cups are white, 
They send up incense all the holy night : 
Our souls are white, made clean in Blood once shed : 
White blessed Angels watch around our bed : 
spotless Lamb of God, still keep us so, 
Thou who wert born for us in time of snow." 

If we set against these poems the lyric called 
"Heaven Overarches," dated 1893, and probably 
the last composition of Miss Rossetti, we find essen- 
tially the same style, a little chastened perhaps, and 
simplified to the point of austerity, but in no way 
distinctly marking the lapse of forty years.

THE DIAL, 



[April 1, 



" Heaven overarches earth and sea, 

Earth-sadness and sea-bitterness. 
Heaven overarches you and me : 
A little while and we shall be 
Please God where there is no more sea 
Nor barren wilderness. 

" Heaven overarches yon and me, 

And all earth's gardens and her graves. 
Look up with me, until we see 
The day break and the shadows flee. 
What though to-night wrecks you and me 
If so to-morrow saves." 

An unexpected feature of this volume is found in 
the nearly forty pages of Italian lyrics. "The 
Italian verses were kept by Christina in the jealous 
seclusion of her writing-desk," says her brother, " and 
I suppose no human eye had looked upon them until 
I found them there after her death." We may find 
space for one short song, " Kipetizione ": 

" Credea di rivederti e ancor ti aspetto ; 

Di giorno in giorno ognor ti vo braruando : 
Quando ti rivedr6, cor mio diletto, 
Quando ma quando ? 

" Dissi e ridissi con perenne sete, 

E lo ridico e vo' ridirlo ancora, 
Qual usignol che canta e si ripete 
Fino all' aurora." 

Some of these Italian pieces, and a few of the En- 
glish ones, are expressions of a passion to be dealt 
with by the critic, if at all, with tender and reverent 
touch. Mr. Rossetti says all that is needed by way 
of explanation in a brief note. "My sister was 
twice sought in marriage ; and in each instance was 
well disposed to her suitor, but was withheld by re- 
ligious considerations. The first suitor, a painter, 
was a Christian, but not in the Anglican commun- 
ion ; the second, a scholar and literary man and 
this was far the most serious affair of the two 
either was not a Christian at all, or else was a Chris- 
tian of undefined and heterodox views. The first 
matter terminated towards 1850, the second towards 
1864. Both the men died during Christina's life- 
time." This is deeply interesting, and it is well 
that so much of the truth should be made public ; 
yet it jars a little with our conception of the woman, 
and suggests a narrowness from which we would 
gladly have believed her free. There is no such 
suggestion of intolerance in her work, although that 
work is throughout pervaded by religious emotion 
of the deepest and purest type. 

The suggestion made by Mr. Stedman that Chris- 
tina Rossetti deserved to succeed Tennyson in the 
laureateship was followed, after Miss Rossetti's 
death, by a suggestion from Mr. Coventry Patmore 
naming Mrs. Meynell for that honor. If anything 
can soften the sense of our loss in the death of the 
former of these women, it is that the latter still re- 
mains with us. The little volume of her poems now 
published is largely a reprint of the " Preludes " of 
1875 (when the writer was Miss Alice Thompson). 
Some of the early poems are, however, omitted, and 
their place is taken by " the few verses written in 
maturer years." The volume is a very slender one. 



but its contents are pure gold. " A poet of one 
mood in all my lays," Mrs. Meynell styles herself, 
and the characterization seems apt if we remember 
that into this one mood of spiritual aspiration is 
distilled the very essence of poetic feeling for nature 
and the human heart, that it is a mood in which 
vision becomes clairvoyant in its refinement, and 
expression fits itself to emotion as by a sort of pre- 
established harmony. The world will be unworthy 
of poetry that can ever forget such work as " Re- 
nouncement," " The Modern Poet," and " My Heart 
Shall Be Thy Garden." For the latter of these three 
perfect poems we may find space. 

" My heart shall be thy garden. Come, my own, 

Into thy garden ; thine be happy hours 

Among my fairest thoughts, my tallest flowers, 
From root to crowning petal, thine alone. 
Thine is the place from where the seeds are sown 

Up to the sky enclosed, with all its showers. 

But ah, the birds, the birds ! Who shall build bowers 
To keep these thine ? O friend, the birds have flown. 
For as these come and go, and quit our pine 

To follow the sweet season, or, new-comers, 

Sing one song only from our alder-trees. 
My heart has thoughts, which, though thine eyes hold mine, 

Flit to the silent world and other summers, 
With wings that dip beyond the silver seas." 

Among recent examples of American book-making 
there are few to vie with the series of " English Love 
Sonnets " begun with " The House of Life " a year 
or two ago, now continued with a volume contain- 
ing Mr. W. S. Blunt's " Esther " and " The Love 
Sonnets of Proteus," and soon to include the " Son- 
nets from the Portuguese" as a third number. 
These beautiful volumes are printed on Dutch hand- 
made paper, with borders and initial letters by Mr. 
Bertram Goodhue, are in shape square octavos, and 
are published in limited editions. As for the work 
of Mr. Blunt now published, description is hardly 
called for. " Esther " is a sequence of fifty-four son- 
nets, including a dedication " to the Best-Beloved "; 
the " Proteus " sonnets number one hundred and 
forty-two. All of these " sonnets " are irregular in 
form, some of them having sixteen, and even fifteen, 
verses, while those not thus audaciously lengthened 
take all sorts of liberties with the scheme of rhymes. 
Some verses have no rhymes at all, and many others 
rhyme but imperfectly. A general tendency toward 
the Shakespearian form is to be discerned, but 
hardly more than this can be said in the way of met- 
rical characterization. Of the poetry itself, it must 
be said that it offers a veritable transcript of life, 
glowing and passionate : 

" This is the book. For evil and for good, 
What my life was in it is written plain. 
These are no dreams, but things of flesh and blood, 
The past that lived and shall not live again." 

The irregularity of form is symbolic of a wayward- 
ness of feeling that has not learned the wholesome 
lesson of restraint ; the verse is often diffuse, impul- 
sive, and roughly-wrought. It is not often, for ex- 
ample, that so finished and organic a sonnet results 
as that we are about to copy : 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

" Yes, spring is come, but joy alas is gone, 
Gone ere we knew it, while our foolish eyes, 
Which should have watched its motions every one 
Were looking elsewhere, at the hills, the skies, 
Chasing vain thoughts, as children butterflies, 
Until the hour struck and the day was done, 
And we looked up in passionate surprise 
To find that clouds had blotted out our sun. 
Our joys are gone and what is left to us, 
Who loved not even love when it was here ? 
What but a voice which sobs monotonous 
As these sad waves upon the rocks, the dear 
Fond voice which once made music with our own, 
And which our hearts now ache to think upon." 

If Mr. Blunt's fulfilment often comes short of his 
aim, that aim is at least a high one. It finds beau- 
tiful expression at the close of one of the last son- 
nets of the sequence : 

" Oh, if there be 

Still in this world of vanished creeds and kings 
Some faith in royal blood and right divine, 
Some lingering reverence paid to majesty, 
Here seek it and here find it, for it clings 
To each hushed verse like incense to a shrine." 

While on the subject of reprints, we may take 
occasion to say a few words of a curious poem dat- 
ing from 1831, which Mr. Andrew Lang has 
thought it worth while to introduce to modern read- 
ers, and which has just been published in attractive 
form by London and Chicago houses. It is a boy- 
ish work of Thomas T. Stoddart, who died as re- 
cently as 1880, and was best known as a disciple 
of Walton, and as a writer of some very charming 
angling lyrics. The poem is called " The Death- 
Wake ; or, Lunacy," and is further described as " a 
necromaunt in three chimeras." It is a narrative 
in rhymed couplets upon a ghastly theme. A young 
monk, enamored in secret of a nun, is driven to dis- 
traction by her death, digs up her body at dead of 
night, carries it off in a boat to a remote rocky 
coast, and gloats over the corpse while corruption 
is doing its loathsome work. The poem cannot 
be read without a shudder, even in this age of 
Zolaism, and yet it includes passages of rare poetic 
beauty, and those who begin it will hardly put the 
book aside until they have come to the grisly end. 
As an illustration of the extravagances of roman- 
ticism, it occupies a place in English poetry almost 
unique. The wildest imaginings of Scott and of 
Coleridge seem commonplace beside this daring 
conception. Mr. Lang does not overstate the ar- 
gument for this poem when he ascribes to its au- 
thor " an accent original, distinct, strangely musical, 
and really replete with promise. He has a fresh 
unborrowed melody and mastery of words, the first 
indispensable sign of a true poet." Such a passage 
as this in which the frenzied monk, adrift upon the 
waves, likens himself to the sea, attests the music 
and vivid imaginative quality of the poem: 

" For we are, 

In feature, as the sun is to a star, 
So are we like, and we are touch' d in tune 
With lunacy as music ; and the moon, 
That setteth the tides sentinel before 
Thy camp of waters, on the pebbled shore, 



And measures their great footsteps to and fro, 
Hath lifted up into my brain the flow 
Of this mad tide of blood." 

The book is strangely fascinating, in spite of its 
morbid quality, and was well worth reprinting. A 
few short poems by the author are appended, and 
deepen the impression made by the " necromaunt " 
that precedes them. Stoddard was a poet by nature, 
if " he only blossomed once," and a poet of marked 
individuality at that. 

Mr. W. B. Yeats is only thirty years of age, but 
he has been prolific of verse, and is now enabled to 
select from the considerable mass of his work those 
parts which he deems worthy of preservation in a 
definitive edition. The volume of " Poems " result- 
ing from this selection includes three larger works 
in dramatic or semi-dramatic form " The Wan- 
derings of Usheen," " The Countess Cathleen," and 
" The Land of Heart's Desire " and nearly two 
score shorter pieces. The peculiar Celtic form of 
imagination, and the note of mysticism which so 
often pervades expressions of the Celtic temper, are 
everywhere noticeable in this volume. We do not 
always know what the author means, and we do not 
always care to know, so absolute are the terms of his 
art at its best. It would be difficult to make a log- 
ical analysis of such lines as those inscribed to " The 
Rose of Battles," for example : 

" Rose of all Roses, Rose of all theVWorld ! 
You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled 
Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring 
The bell that calls us on : the sweet far thing. 
Beauty grown sad with its eternity 
Made you of us, and of the dim grey sea. 
Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait, 
For God has bid them share an equal fate ; 
And when at last defeated in His wars, 
They have gone down under the same white stars, 
We shall no longer hear the little cry 
Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die." 

But then, it would be difficult to formulate the 
thought of " Kubla Khan " or " The Blessed Dam- 
ozel." These things are simply beautiful, and we 
accept them as such without question. 

That Mr. Blackmore is a poet a sort of poet 
his readers know well. His novels are filled with 
lyric passages that are evidently struggling to escape 
from the trammels of prose, and sometimes do es- 
cape for a brief flight. " Lorna Doone " is written 
largely in broken hexameters that even the least 
musical of readers must discover after a while. So 
it is not wholly a surprise to receive a volume of 
acknowledged verse from Mr. Blackmore's pen, a 
volume consisting, in the main, of four long narra- 
tive poems upon classical and oriental themes. What 
calls for particular mention is the freakish way in 
which these poems are printed, and which is best 
illustrated by a specimen|stanza from " Lita of the 
Nile " the priest's prayer for the rising of the 
waters. 

" King and Father, gift and giver, God revealed in form of 
river, Issuing perfect and sublime From the fountain-head of 
time, Whom eternal mystery shroudeth, Unapproached, un- 
track'd, unknown ; Whom the Lord of heaven enclondeth

With the curtains of His throne, From the throne of heaven 
descending, Glory, power, and goodness blending, Grant us, 
ere the daylight dies, Token of thy rapid rise." 

A prefatory note accounts for the modest title of 
this volume. " (Fringilla loquitur) ' What means 
your finch ? ' Being well aware that he cannot sing 
like a nightingale, He flits about from tree to tree, 
and twitters a little tale." We must find room to 
quote entire the epilogue, " To Fame," which is the 
best piece of verse in the volume. It is not a great 
poem, but it is pleasing in its simple sincerity. 

" Bright Fairy of the morn, with flowers arrayed, Whose 
beauties to thy young pursuer seem Beyond the ecstasy of 
poet's dream Shall I o'ertake thee ere thy lustre fade ? 

" Ripe glory of the noon, august and proud, A vision of high 
purpose, power, and skill, Dissolving into mirage of good-will 
Do I o'ertake thee, or embrace a cloud ? 

u Gray shadow of the evening, gaunt and bare, At random 
cast, beyond me or above, And cold as memory in the arms 
of love If I o'ertook thee now what should I care ? 

" ' No morn, or noon, or eve am I,' she said, ' But night 
the depth of night behind the sun, By all mankind pursued ; 
but never won, Until my shadow falls upon a shade.' " 

This book is beautifully printed, and made doubly 
attractive by Mr. W. H. Bradley's " decorative pic- 
turings " in the form of cover design, borders, ini- 
tials, and full-page drawings. It is printed on hand- 
made paper, and the edition is limited. 

There are only about forty pages of verse in Mr. 
Watson's new volume, but it outweighs most of the 
other volumes examined in this review. An "Apo- 
logia " in blank verse, two lyrics, three sonnets, and 
three long poems, make up the entire contents. The 
" Apologia " should not have been printed, for it 
only emphasizes once more Mr. Watson's most con- 
spicuous fault self-consciousness. The lyrics are 
trifles, as are likewise two of the sonnets. The third 
sonnet, " The Turk in Armenia," will bear compar- 
ison with the noblest in the English language, and 
more specifically challenges comparison with Mil- 
ton's sonnet on the Piedmont massacres, and Ros- 
setti's " On the Refusal of Aid between Nations." 
The three long poems are a " Hymn to the Sea," a 
set of stanzas on " The Tomb of Burns," and the 
poem that gives the volume its title. Of the first 
of these three, we may say that it has been praised 
out of all proportion to its merits, yet remains a 
noteworthy production. It is forced and turgid, 
yet when all is said, it must still be accounted one 
of the most remarkable of experiments in English 
elegiacs. The real strength of Mr. Watson's vol- 
ume is in the two poems that we have left to the 
last. How happily he can write literary criticism in 
verse is known to all who have read his Words- 
worth, Tennyson, and Shelley poems. His Burns 
poem belongs to this group, and is perhaps the 
finest of the four. The form is as follows : 
" He came when poets had forgot 

How rich and strange the human lot ; 

How warm the tents of Life, how hot 
Are Love and Hate ; 

And what makes Truth divine, and what 
Makes Manhood great." 



Here is another stanza one of the best : 
" A dreamer of the common dreams, 
A fisher in familiar streams, 
He chased the transitory gleams 

That all pursue ; 

But on his lips the eternal themes 
Again were new." 

This is very nobly put and impressive, yet, when 
we come to examine it closely, its virtue appears a 
trifle too "literary"; it is the virtue of rhetoric 
or critical prose rather than of song. How it falls 
short of the higher poetical excellence may be shown 
by the test of the touchstone in this case happily 
provided by the greatest of living poets, who has 
published in " The Nineteenth Century " for Feb- 
ruary a poem upon the same subject, written in ex- 
actly the same stanza. Here is an extract from 
Mr. Swinburne's poem : 

" Earth, and the snow-dimmed heights of air, 
And waters winding soft and fair 
Through still sweet places, bright and bare, 

By bent and byre 
Taught him what hearts within them were : 

But his was fire." 

Here is, after all, the true spontaneous utterance, 
the art wherein art is most concealed, the sublima- 
tion of poetical expression. A similar test, could 
one so exactly fitting be found, would lead to the 
same judgment upon " The Father of the Forest," 
which is, on the whole, the finest of Mr. Watson's 
new poems. A venerable yew is apostrophized, and 
the pageant of English history, unrolled through the 
centuries that the tree has stood, is brought into 
retrospect. Of the many felicitous descriptions and 
characterizations we may select a few. 

" On that proud morn when England's eyes, 

Wet with tempestuous joy, beheld 
Round her rough coasts the thundering main 
Strewn with the ruined dream of Spain." 

" The sweet queen of a tragic hour 
Crowned with her snow-white memory 
The crimson legend of the Tower." 

" The Conqueror, in our soil who set 
This stem of Kinghood flowering yet." 

" His battles o'er, he takes his ease, 

Glory put by, and sceptered toil. 
Round him the carven centuries 

Like forest branches arch and coil. 
In that dim fame, he is not sure 
Who lost or won at Azincour ! " 

This seems to us nearly, if not quite, as good as the 
foreshadowings of English history in Gray's great 
ode, and the dignity of the poem is sustained through- 
out at the elevation suggested by these extracts. 
There can be no doubt that the volume which we 
have just sought to characterize has brought Mr. 
Watson a long step nearer to the goal of his ambi- 
tion. It seems more nearly possible than ever be- 
fore that he may in time secure recognition among 
the greater English poets of the century. At all 
events, he now stands far to the front in the group 
of the younger singers. 

Mr. John Davidson, also, is a young poet of sin- 
gular promise, although a fluent versatility is more

THE DIAL

than likely to prove his bane. In his " Fleet Street 
Eclogues " he has done something almost new in 
kind. A knot of London journalists come together 
on the chief holidays of the year, and compare notes 
upon the chief subjects of human concern, discours- 
ing in easy and often striking verse upon such sub- 
jects as nature (pp. 31, 43, 83), politics (p. 124), 
economics (p. 123), literature (p. 113), love (p. 27), 
heredity (p. 148), and theology of a rather ama- 
teurish and pantheistic sort (pp. 153, 201). 
" Fancy where it lists 

Breathes like the wind : he who resists 

His wanton moods forever, ends 
In being moodless." 

Mr. Davidson, certainly, does not allow fancy to 
resist any mood, however wanton, and his " ec- 
logues " offer the strangest medley of prosaic themes 
touched by poetic feeling, and of poetry suggested 
by the commonest incidents. The passion for na- 
ture, as it rushes upon the hearts of men toiling 
amid the unlovely environment of the city, is the 
predominant note of these poems, and finds vent in 
many a rapturous lyric strain. 

" Heaven is to tread unpaven ground, 

And care no more for prose or rhyme," 

remarks Sandy, and calls upon his brother- journalist 
to " make us feel the blossom-time." Whereupon 
Menzies responds : 

" The patchwork sunshine nets the lea ; 
The flitting shadows halt and pass ; 
Forlorn, the mossy humble-bee 
Lounges along the flowerless grass. 

" With unseen smoke as pure as dew, 

Sweeter than love or lovers are, 
Wood- violets of watchet hue 
Their secret hearths betray afar. 

" The vanguards of the daisies come, 

Summer's crusaders sanguine-stained, 
The only flowers that left their home 
When happiness in Eden reigned. 

" They strayed abroad, old writers tell, 

Hardy and bold, east, west, south, north ; 
Our guilty parents, when they fell, 

And flaming vengeance drove them forth, 

" Their haggard eyes in vain to God, 

To all the stars of heaven turned ; 

But when they saw where in the sod 

The golden-hearted daisies burned, 

"Sweet thoughts that still within them dwelt 
Awoke, and tears embalmed their smart ; 
On Eden's daisies couched they felt 
They carried Eden in their heart." 

It is easy to pick flaws in these verses, but difficult 
to avoid being swept away by their emotional cur- 
rent. If now and then we come upon such an infe- 
licitous phrase as "cabbage blade," we are soon 
more than rewarded by such bits as the " husky 
whisper of the corn," " the blackbirds with their 
oboe voices," the " avenues of latticed light," and 

" The grass-green turf 
Where primroses by secret alchemy 
Distil from buried treasure golden leaves." 

One more extract, in substance a confession of faith, 
must suffice us. 



" I said within : Three things are worthiest knowing, 
And when I know them nothing else I know. 
I know unboundedly, what needs no showing, 
That women are most beautiful ; and then 
I know I love them ; and I know again 
Herein alone true science lies, for, lo ! 
Old Rome 's a ruin ; Cassar is a name ; 
The Church ? alas ! a life boat, warped and sunk ; 
God, a disputed title : but the fame 
Of those who sang of love, fresher than spring, 
Blossoms forever with the tree of life, 
Whose boughs are generations ; and its trunk 
Love ; and its flowers, lovers." 

Two new volumes by Mrs. Marriott- Watson are 
among the more noteworthy collections of recent 
verse. The author, who is perhaps better known as 
" Graham R. Tomson," stands high among the liv- 
ing women who have approved themselves poets, for 
her work is always pure and elevated in thought, 
felicitious in diction, and artistic in form. The ded- 
ication of one of these collections to Mrs. Meynell 
is suggestive, since the author is not unlike the wo- 
man to whom she pays this tribute in the delicate 
spirituality and elusive charm of her work. Mrs. 
Marriott- Watson has perhaps a little more of color 
and of epic quality ; the latter illustrated by the ad- 
mirable ballads contained in the present and pre- 
viously published volumes, the former by such stan- 
zas as these from " Hesternse Rosse ": 

" Between the bounds of night and day, 

Far out into the west they lie, 
More sweet than any song may say, 

The red rose-gardens of the sky. 

" Beyond the sunset wreck forlorn, 

Of tower and temple overthrown, 
Of fallen fort and banner torn, 
Burns the red flame of roses blown. 

" Through jewelled jalousies ajar, 

That ruddy lustre shines aslant 
From terraced vistas stretching far, 
The mellow light of old romaunt. 

" 'Tis there the vanished roses blow 

In splendour of eternal prime, 

That graced the summers long ago, 

The royal revels of old time." 

A sheaf of sweet unpretentious lyrics and a few 
pieces in lighter vein make up the " Songs and Other 
Verses " of Miss Dollie Radford. The following 
lines are a good example of her work : 

" Because I built my nest so high, 

Must I despair 

If a fierce wind, with bitter cry. 
Passes the lower branches by, 

And mine makes bare ? 

" Because I hung it, in my pride, 

So near the skies, 
Higher than other nests abide, 
Must I lament if far and wide 

It scattered lies ? 

" I shall but build, and build my best, 

Till, safety won, 
I hang aloft my new-made nest, 
High as of old, and see it rest, 

As near the sun." 

Miss Blind justifies the title given her volume of 
poems by a "Prelude" in "Locksley Hall" couplets.

"On and on, along old Nilus, seeking still an ampler light, 
O'er its monumental mountains, Birds of Passage take their 

flight. 
" Where the sacred Isle of Fhilae, twinned within the sacred 

stream, 
Floats, like some rapt Opium-eater's labyrinthine lotos 

dream, 
" Birds on birds take up their quarters in each creviced 

capital, 

In each crack of frieze and cornice, in each cleft of roof and 
wall." 

About half of the poems are upon Egyptian themes, 
the others come nearer home. We may select an 
"Evensong" in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford 
(one of a group of " Shakespeare Sonnets "), in illus- 
tration of Miss Blind's most careful workmanship. 

" The hectic autumn's dilatory fire 

Has turned this lime tree to a sevenfold brand, 
Which, self-consuming, lights the sunless land, 

A death to which all poet souls aspire. 

Above the graves, where all men's vain desire 
Is hushed at last as by a Mother's hand, 
And, Time confounded, Love's blank records stand, 

The Evensong swells from the pulsing choir. 

"What incommunicable presence clings 

To this grey church and willowy twilight stream ? 
Am I the dupe of some delusive dream ? 

Or, like faint fluid phosphorescent rings 
On refluent seas, doth Shakespeare's spirit gleam 

Pervasive round these old familiar things? " 

The poetic elevation of this volume is fairly con- 
stant, but the diction is far from perfect, revealing 
many flaws that a little more care might have pol- 
ished away. 

Mr. Francis Thompson's " Sister-Songs," the au- 
thor tells us in a note, were written at about the 
same time as the chief poems in his earlier-published 
volume. Examination shows them to be, not a col- 
lection of pieces, but a single poem in sections, 
irregular in form, and characterized by all " the 
illuminous and volute redundance " of " The Hound 
of Heaven " and its companion compositions. That 
we have here, as in the previous volume, the stun* 
of poetry in a high sense is evident to the most cas- 
ual inspection. The following excerpt will amply 
illustrate the statement : 

" In all I work, my hand include th thine ; 

Thou rnshest down in every stream 
Whose passion frets my spirit's deepening gorge ; 
Unhood'st mine eyas-heart, and fliest my dream ; 

Thou swing'st the hammers of my forge ; 
As the innocent moon, that nothing does but shine, 
Moves all the labouring surges of the world." 

But it is equally evident that the mannerisms, the 
obscurity, and the forced expression that seem insep- 
arable from Mr. Thompson's work forbid its inclu- 
sion in the body of poetry accepted by the world as 
great. It may become the subject of a cult ; it can 
never win the unqualified suffrage of sane opinion 
trained in the school of Milton, Wordsworth and 
Tennyson. 

Mr. Charles Newton-Robinson's songs, named by 
a pretty fancy " The Viol of Love " (reference being 
had to the harmonies and sympathetic vibrations 
characteristic of that instrument), are musical 



enough, and suffused with passion ; they err at times, 
as do Mr. Thompson's although not in like de- 
gree from excessive indulgence in conceits, and 
the striving for effect by strange verbal devices. 
We reproduce the first and last stanzas of " Love's 
Messengers." 

" Wind, happy river ! to the sea, 
Whereby she dwells who loves not me, 
And waft her from this inner moat 
The spoils that on thy waters float, 
My messengers to be 1 



" Wind, happy river ! to the sea, 
And bear these messengers for me. 
But if no kind reply comes back 
Ere swallows take their southern track, 
Myself thy spoil will be ! " 

A few translations close the volume, whereby the 
author shows himself a bold man, for he ventures on 
Horace, Book I., Ode 5, and Villon's " Ballade des 
Dames du Temps Jadis," challenging comparison 
with Milton and Rossetti. 

A real Laureate and a would-have-been Laureate 
contribute to the verse of the year, Mr. Alfred 
Austin publishing " England's Darling," a dramatic 
poem concerned with Alfred the Great, while Sir 
Edwin Arnold gives us " The Tenth Muse " (being 
the Muse of Journalism, hight Ephemera) with other 
poems. Mr. Austin has chosen to deal with the 
great king of the West Saxons because he has always 
been the chosen hero of the English people, although 
hitherto unsung in fitting measures. We may also 
shrewdly suspect that Mr. Austin has not been un- 
mindful of the "Harold" and "Becket" of his 
great predecessor, and has sought to emulate so 
noble an example. The best to be said of " En- 
gland's Darling " is that it is the conscientious ex- 
pression of a genuine enthusiasm. But the verse 
is unfailingly pedestrian, and a single page of " Har- 
old " outweighs the whole of the later work. We 
may quote the closing words of Alfred, spoken after 
he has come to terms with the heathen, and made 
the settlement of the Danelagh in 878. 

" In this strong isle sequestered by the sea 
From tread outlandish, victory upon ground 
Our own to keep or lose, is half defeat ; 
For why on English soil should foe's foot stand ? 
The battlemented Sea will beat him off, 
So we but man it, and our bounding prows 
Scatter him flying deathward o'er the foam, 
Like loose leaves harried by autumnal wind. 
Aye, and in those bright bodings that high Heaven 
Vouchsafes at times to man, my ken foresees 
That once this land, inviolably free 
From threat without, its billow-suckled breed, 
Yearning beyond the narrow bonds of birth, 
Wherever shine the stars or rolls the tide, 
Will lay their lordship on the waves, and be 
Ilulers and rovers of the widening world." 

Mr. Austin's poem upon the death of Lord Tenny- 
son also appears in this volume. 

Of Sir Edwin Arnold's volume there is not much 
to say. It includes some widely-reprinted verses 
upon the death of Tennyson, a number of Oriental 
pieces, mostly translations, and the ode which gives

to the collection a title. Of the Muse Ephemera 
the author writes in this top-lofty fashion : 

" And if, indeed, her hand 

Wieldeth no fiery brand 
To strike oppression down, stay the wrong-doer, 

Chastise the wicked law, 

And guilty plunder draw 
From wealthy robbers, and be swift pursuer 

Of crime and guile ; alway, 

To seize, and smite, and slay, 
Muses ! this plumed quill which she doth bear 

Is keener in the strife, 

Strikes closer to the life, 
Than sword of Themis, or Athene's spear." 

This is not poetry, of course, nor is anything else 
contained in the volume, but it passes for such with 
some readers, and will not, in all probability, go quite 
unadmired. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Sketches of 
Paris under 
the Terror. 



" The Journal of a Spy in Paris " 
(Harper) is the partly conjectural 
title affixed by the publishers to what 
we presume to be a newly discovered, or at least 
hitherto unpublished, fragment of a diary kept by 
an eye-witness of the dramatic scenes in Paris under 
the Terror, during the awful months of January to 
July, 1794, or from the enactment of the Maximum 
Laws down to within a week of the 9th of Thermi- 
dor. The fragment seems to be genuine, and the 
publishers assure us that it is so. Assuming this to 
be the case, the little book is of considerable interest 
to students of the period. " Raoul Hesdin " is the 
name written upon the brown-paper cover of the 
original ; and Hesdin seems to have been employed 
as an engraver, under the Committee of Public 
Safety, occupying a room in the Tuileries, near to 
that in which the Committee itself sat. That he 
was a secret agent of the British Government seems 
probable. Hesdin's diary is brimful of vivid little 
pen-sketches of the ruling spirits of the day, Robe- 
spierre, St. Just, Collot, Billaud, Bare're, Hubert, 
and so on, and his trenchant comments, and bits of 
floating political gossip, seem to bring us wonder- 
fully near to the times. That he " supped full of 
horrors " during those wild days, his pages often 
testify. Here is a statement which the reader may 
usefully compare with Chapter X. of Volume II. of 
Mr. Morse Stephens's in many respects admirable 
"History of the French Revolution": "I often 
wonder if people outside France are aware of the 
utter disappearance of gaiety which has accom- 
panied this Revolution." It may be remembered 
that Mr. Stephens's work contains the following re- 
markable sentence : " It is most essential to grasp 
the fact that there was no particular difference, for 
the vast majority of the population, in living in 
Paris during the Reign of Terror and at other 
times." Speaking of Robespierre's manner in the 
tribune, Hesdin says that his discourses " are always 
of interminable length and dulness, only relieved 



by vague threats levelled at some group of persons, 
seldom or never at an individual. He has a terrible 
habit of stopping ; just as you think him about to 
descend, he fixes his lenses to his eyes more firmly, 
takes a furtive look round, and goes on again." De- 
scribing the crowning Utopian gambol of that strange 
era, the Feast of the Supreme Being, the diarist 
concludes : " If, when the Statue was unveiled, 
Robespierre had sprung onto its pedestal, declared 
the Revolution closed, and claimed the crown of 
St. Louis from over a bristling hedge of General 
Hanriot's bayonets, the day would have been his. 
I know that many persons fully believed he would 
do so." The political information in Hesdin's book 
is meagre and unimportant ; but as a picture by an 
intelligent eye-witness, whose special business was to 
see and hear, of the social condition of Paris dur- 
ing the period treated, it is of no little value. 

Two important Two books on Church history are 
books on of special interest to the New Testa- 

church history. ment student> Dr> R g. Moxom's 

" From Jerusalem to Nicea " (Roberts) is one of a 
class with which the Lowell lectures to which it 
belongs have already acquainted the reading public. 
It is neither a text-book nor does it embody the fruit 
of any large original investigations. Nevertheless, 
it is written in an entertaining, simple style, and 
shows wide reading and admirable arrangement. 
Especially in its chapter upon the organization of 
the early Church has the author given an exceed- 
ingly compact and distinct r6sum6. The latter por- 
tion of the period is covered with considerable de- 
tail, the Christian school of Alexandria coming in 
for an entire lecture. Such an arrangement may be 
justified by the importance of Clement of Alexan- 
dria and Origen, but it is a question as to whether 
or not the perspective and the proportion of the 
treatment have not somewhat suffered. The chapter 
upon the struggle between heretical sects is, per- 
haps, the least satisfactory, being hardly more than 
a series of short, disconnected articles upon heretics 
of greater or less importance. Also, in describing 
the struggle of the Church with heathenism, the au- 
thor has allowed the necessity of the lecturer's 
interesting his audience to lead him, perhaps, to 
treat Tertullian at a little too considerable length. 
Nevertheless, the work is admirably conceived, and 
in the concluding lecture upon the Council of Nicaea 
gives probably as good an account of that remark- 
able Council as is to be found within equal compass. 
A little hand-book by Professor Rudolph Sohm, 
entitled " Outlines of Church History " (Macmillan), 
has a peculiar excellence of being a Church history 
written by a Professor of Law. Such a prepara- 
tion for the Church historian is unique, yet altogether 
necessary if one would have a correct comprehen- 
sion of those tremendous struggles through which 
the Church has passed and in which the points at 
issue were hardly more often theological than legal. 
The fact that this work has passed through eight 
editions in less than six years is in itself testimony

THE DIAL

to its worth, and, in fact, it is especially in the Mid- 
dle Ages and in the Reformation period that it is 
possessed of singular excellence as a text-book. It 
is a matter of regret, both in the case of Dr. Moxom 
and in this of Professor Sohm, that we have no 
references to authorities, and that, therefore, the 
reader and the student are given no means of deter- 
mining the worth of a judgment or the basis of a 
statement. Professor Sohm seems further, in his 
paragraph upon the society of our day, to take a 
somewhat pessimistic view of affairs. But we can- 
not help agreeing with him that the forces of re- 
form, and, indeed, those forces which are to preserve 
what is good in our civilization, are to be found not 
in a culture based upon a materialistic conception 
of life, but in those other forces which are religious, 
and, more particularly, which are the expression of 
the Gospel. And it is upon this basis that both his- 
tory and criticism are enabling faith to found itself. 

A certain great art-critic wrote in his 
2L earlier da y s something aboutthe man 
who has treated life in the spirit of 
art." He did not have in mind the exuberance or ex- 
cess which his expression might suggest to some peo- 
ple ; he was thinking of a thoughtful effort after a fine 
personality, of an exquisite regard to one's own har- 
monies, of a view of life as a chance for a " master- 
piece," in the old-time sense. He thought, perhaps, 
though he was long before them, of such triumphs 
as Lord Reggie of " Green Carnation " fame, of that 
book-billed narcissus, of our friend Tubby, of Mrs. 
Meynell's man of fine negations. Of no such fan- 
tasies, however, was Mr. Robert Grant thinking 
when he wrote "The Art of Living" (Scribners), 
but rather of the far more practical matters of in- 
come, dwelling, children, summer vacations. The 
aesthetic soul will look at the book with a bitter 
sneer. " The Art of Living," says Mr. Grant, " writ- 
ten without a notion of what Art is, or what is 
Life." In a way, certainly, the very idea of ex- 
pounding the Art of Living to a man with an income 
of from seven to eleven thousand dollars, excites a 
slight smile. Or else it seems a little sad that a 
clever man like Mr. Grant should have so misun- 
derstood Art and Life as to imagine that house- 
furnishing and the summer problem had any con- 
nection with either of them. But when one glances 
at his book one begins to have a certain altruistic 
pleasure that at last someone should have taken 
pity on that awful creature, the Philistine with the 
eleven-thousand dollar income. Of course he is too 
limited to do anything in the way of living, or of 
art either, and of course, with his painful misunder- 
standings, Mr. Grant could not tell him anything 
about either of them ; but when one thinks of what 
his real state must be, one can see that this book 
offers practical amelioration. So even the aesthete, 
if he really have that philanthropic warmth which 
does so much to give a fine toning to an artistic 
character, may well be glad at this attempt to hold 
out to a neglected middle class some aims which are 



not in the wrong direction, some ideals which will 
not seem too high. We have much in American 
life, to-day, that should be otherwise ; it makes one 
uncomfortable to think of it all. One way of deal- 
ing with it is by going abroad. Another way is by 
woman's clubs, art interchanges, popular magazines, 
summer schools. Another way, namely, that of Mr. 
Grant, a man whose vision has a pretty broad range, 
is to indicate without nonsense or cant certain ways 
in which even a man with an income of from seven 
to eleven thousand dollars can rid himself of some 
of the grasping and hindering clutches of custom 
and convention, and infuse into his existence some 
little whiffs of what he will soon come to recognize 
as life. 

" That Dome in Air " (McClurg) is 

the ha ?py title of a volume of e88avs 

" thoughts on poetry and the 
poets " by Mr. John Vance Cheney. In the intro- 
ductory chapter, Mr. Cheney says some good and 
true things about the relation of poetry to life. He 
then proceeds to a series of special studies, their 
subjects being Emerson, Lowell, Whittier, Longfel- 
low, Bryant, Whitman, Blake, Cowper, and Words- 
worth. These papers are pleasant, discursive, almost 
familiar in tone, the reflection of a cultivated mind 
that loves literature, and likes to talk over with 
friends the books it has been engaged upon. Pi- 
quancy of style and a wide range of illustrative ma- 
terial are noticeable throughout this volume, while 
the criticism is usually sane and genial. We must, 
however, except from this general statement a part 
of what Mr. Cheney says concerning Whitman. 
When we consider some of the extravagant things 
that English critics have said of Whitman, a certain 
amount of exasperation is pardonable in an Amer- 
ican critic with some sense of literary values, but 
Mr. Cheney carries it too far. Whitman is vulner- 
able enough at other points, surely, to make unneces- 
sary an attack upon the immortal " When lilacs last 
in the dooryard bloomed." Mr. Cheney gives us a 
bald prose paraphrase of the first lines of that mag- 
nificent song, and then asks : " Tried by any test or 
standard, what is there of poetry in the magisterial 
dithyrambs not in the prose version ? " We can 
only rub our eyes in amazement at such a saying. 
But it is almost the only serious lapse of judgment 
in Mr. Cheney's volume, and is offset by many a 
felicitous critical hit, all the more praiseworthy be- 
cause most of his subjects are well-worn, and the 
difficulty of finding new things to say correspond- 
ingly great.

is a young English archaeologist (but not too young), 
whose training was of the rigorous Cambridge type, 
and whose opportunities, as Director for several 
years of the British School of Archaeology at Athens, 
added to great natural gifts, have qualified him in 
an eminent degree for his task. His conception of 
the office of a historian of Greek sculpture is a some- 
what severe one. The reader must not expect to 
be entertained by pleasant chat about the pieces of 
sculpture passed in review ; he will find a compact 
treatment of the technical and historical aspects of 
the subject, a treatment in which the line is sternly 
drawn between what is certainly known or highly 
probable and the audacious guesses of brilliant spec- 
ulators in archaeology. Such a book as this has 
been urgently needed. Mrs. Mitchell's "History 
of Animal Sculpture" is already, after thirteen 
years, somewhat out of date; moreover, praise- 
worthy and useful as her work was, it was after all 
the work of a conscientious compiler rather than of 
an independent authority. Murray's " History of 
Geerk Sculpture " was partially revised for a second 
edition, published in 1890, but it is expensive and 
its merits were never preeminent. As for other 
competing books in English, the less said about 
them the better. Mr. Gardner's Handbook ought 
therefore to meet with great success. It should be 
added that the fifty-five carefully chosen illustra- 
tions contained in Part I. are most successful, so 
that the study of them is both instructive and enjoy- 
able. Even Collignon's " Histoire de la Sculpture 
Grecque" does not, except for its heliogravures, 
reach so high a standard of excellence in this respect.

the poems. While much of Foe's comment on the 
current writing of his day is of only temporary in- 
trinsic interest, Mr. Stedman truly says that " to the 
student of our native literature, and to the young 
American writer who would realize the conditions 
of the ' rude forefathers ' of his guild, an acquaint- 
ance with the following essays and sketches is little 
short of indispensable." To this definitive edition, 
with its index, its twelve portraits, and Mr. Ster- 
ner's numerous illustrations, Professor G. E. Wood- 
berry has contributed the rather unsympathetic 
memoir and the valuable notes, the latter including 
an account of some of Poe's sources, references to 
the magazines in which the writings originally ap- 
peared, and, best of all, the variant readings of all 
the poems, as they grew more and more polished 
under their maker's hand. The bibliography, too, 
needs only the addition of the host of critical arti- 
cles upon Poe to take rank with those models from 
the British Museum found in the " Great Writers " 
series. Mr. Stedman's essays introductory to the 
grand divisions of the work are justly appreciative, 
besides glittering with gems of expression. The 
essay upon the poems, with its sly thrust at the

festly the work of a poet-critic, so fine is its discrim- 
ination, so happy its phrasing. To speak broadly 
of this editorial co-partnership, one member fur- 
nishes cultivated literary sensitiveness, and the other 
hard facts, the latter contribution being quite as use- 
ful as the former in work of this kind. On the 
whole, Poe is fortunate in having waited so long for 
an edition of his works that must please his con- 
scious shade, for nothing is here omitted or added 
for mere friendship's sake, and we are fain to believe 
that this author needs no favors. 



A soldier 
and martyr of 
the Revolution. 



"The Revolution," says Victor Hugo, 
" by the side of youthful figures of 
giants such as Danton, Saint-Just, 
and Robespierre, has young ideal figures, like Hoche 
and Marceau." The "Life of Francois-SeVerm Mar- 
ceau" (Macmillan), by Captain T. G. Johnson, is 
a pleasing, sympathetic sketch of the career of the 
brilliant, humane young soldier of the Revolution 
who sleeps at Coblentz, his ashes honored alike by 
friend and foe. Marceau, a soldier at sixteen, a gen- 
eral at twenty-three, a martyr to the liberties of his 
country at twenty-seven, was the Sidney of his time, 
the Bayard of the Revolution, meriting well the 
noble stanzas in which Byron has enshrined the 
epitome of his deeds, the high tradition of his char- 
acter as one who in those stormy times 

"had kept 

The whiteness of his soul ; and thus men o'er him wept." 
Captain Johnson's sketch shows a right appreciation 
of his hero's character, and a fair knowledge of 
events though the critical reader will note an oc- 
casional loose judgment, such as the unpardonable 
statement that the popular branch of the Constituent 
Assembly was composed of men " actuated only by 
sordid hopes and a selfish ambition." To judge thus 
is to miss the essential drift and spirit of the epoch. 
With all their faults of self-confidence, inexperience, 
and boundless faith in the efficacy of legislation, no 
more disinterested and public-spirited elective body 
ever met to mend the affairs of a nation than the 
deputies of the Third Estate in '89. Captain John- 
son gives an interesting sketch of Marceau's cam- 
paigns, notably of those in La Vende*e, and shows 
a good knowledge of military matters. There are 
several maps, and a good portrait of Marceau forms 
the frontispiece. _

at once suggests the work recently done by M. Jus- 
serand, for both writers conceive literature in a 



214 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



larger sense than literary biography and criticism. 
It must be confessed that, in spite of the excellence 
of this fundamental conception, Mr. White has not 
made a very readable book. When we think of M. 
Jusserand's sprightly and charming style, we can 
realize something of the opportunity that the younger 
writer has missed. Mr. White roams over the whole 
field of mediaeval history and literature in search of 
illustrative material, but does not seem to have the 
ability to make out of his facts, when collected, an 
organic structure. We are inclined to say that such 
a work, to accomplish its purpose, must be planned 
upon a far larger scale than has been selected in 
the present instance. 

Sir Charles Lawson's " Private Life 
pf Warren Hastings" (Macmillan) 
is an elaborate vindication of the 
character of the great ruler of India from the odium 
cast upon it by Macaulay's brilliant but unfair essay, 
by the partisan history of Mill, by the famous invec- 
tives of Burke and Sheridan, and by the malignant 
charges of Philip Francis. His public career has 
been examined by such competent men as Sir John 
Strachey, Sir James Stephen, Colonel Malleson, and 
others, and the favorable judgments of these have 
fixed Warren Hastings's honorable place in history. 
The present work is loaded with antiquarian lore 
that has very little interest for the general reader, 
and some of it very little connection with Warren 
Hastings, but it is adorned with fine portraits and 
engravings, and with a multitude of smaller illus- 
trations and fac similes. Some of the chapters, es- 
pecially those on Philip Francis, Hastings's arch- 
enemy, and on the famous trial, are of great inter- 
est ; and the whole book shows the subject of it to 
have been an upright, generous, public-spirited man, 
though not without faults, whose life was embittered 
by the machinations of those whose evil doings he 
exposed, or whose plans he blocked. 

A new treat- Broad margins, white and gold cover, 

ment of the and clear print, make the Rev. T. A. 

Song of Solomon. Goodwin's Lovers Three Thousand 
Years Ago, as Indicated by the Song of Solomon " 
a delightful little volume externally. The author 
had a good purpose in his endeavor to rescue the 
Song of Solomon from the spiritualists and the alle- 
gorists who have disfigured it in the past. He takes 
away the immediate and direct religious element in 
the writing, and regards it as a love song simply, 
whose moral lesson is the triumph of pure love over 
lust. We must, however, confess that the writer's 
biblical scholarship is poor. His introduction, ap- 
parently gotten second-hand from various radical 
critics, is a diatribe against what he calls " plenary 
inspiration," by which he seems to mean " verbal 
inspiration "; and he falls into such historical errors 
as assigning to Ezra and Nehemiah the rebuilding of 
the temple. With the main contention of the book, 
however, no lover of true biblical knowledge can fail 
to be in sympathy. (Open Court Publishing Co.) 



Dr. Tille's " German Songs of To- 
da y" (Macmillan) gives a selection 
of the lyrics produced under the New 
Empire so far as they represent new conditions, 
new tendencies, new philosophies. It does not pre- 
tend, the editor admits, to picture the average taste 
of Germany for lyric poetry in these twenty-five 
years. Such a picture would include the mass of 
new production along old lines, together with the 
statistics of reading and consumption of the poetry 
previously in existence. But it will furnish students 
an opportunity to read as to how the distinctive 
features of modern life are trying to express them- 
selves in German poetry, and incidentally it will 
give some readers for the first time a view of cer- 
tain of these tendencies in Germany. Dr. Tille's 
exposition and criticism of these tendencies in his 
Introduction is admirable. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Philosophers and critics will be glad to have Dr. Paul 
Carus's selection of the best of Goethe and Schiller's 
Xenions (Open Court Publishing Co.), and students of 
German literature will be grateful to one who thus ex- 
cuses them from reading all the product of the great 
poets' little fight. But lovers of poetry will not now, 
any more than then, find refreshment in the Xenions. 
Dr. Carus has translated well, and furnished a good 
brief Introduction. Can it be true, however, that the 
Xenions "have become household words," and that 
" there is no poetry more frequently quoted " ? 

Mr. G. Thorn Drury's edition of the " Poems of John 
Keats" (imported by Scribner), prepared for the 
" Muses Library," is made singularly acceptable by its 
convenient form and tasteful manufacture, and its value 
for students of poetry is furthermore enhanced by the 
elaborate and thoughtful introduction contributed by 
Mr. Robert Bridges, a writer peculiarly fitted by tem- 
perament and poetical achievement to pluck out the 
heart of Keats's mystery. The work is in two volumes. 

" Considerations on Painting " is the collective title 
of a series of lectures given by Mr. John La Farge in 
1893 at the Metropolitan Museum of New York, and 
now issued in a neat volume of 260 odd pages (Mac- 
millan). It is a pleasure to find a professional painter 
discussing the various schools and theories and more or 
less burning questions connected with his art in so en- 
tirely critical and catholic a spirit as that shown by Mr. 
La Farge in these admirable lectures. Some interest- 
ing notes and memoranda of lessons are appended. The 
book will be largely read by intelligent art students and 
amateurs; and the general reader will find it lucid and 
entertaining. 

The Chautauqua-Century Press has begun the pub- 
lication of two series of pamphlets entitled the " Way-

LITERARY NOTES. 



The first volume of Victor Hugo's letters will appear 
in June. 

" Alice de Beaurepaire," a sequel to " Madame Sans- 
Gene," will be published shortly by Messrs. C. E. Brown 
& Co. of Boston. 

Volume VII. of Mr. Henry B. Wheatley's painstak- 
ing edition of Fepys has just been published by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. 

" The Atheist's Mass and Other Stories " is the latest 
volume in the Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac, with 
preface by Mr. Saintsbury. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. have in press a volume of 
letters that passed between Renan and his sister Hen- 
riette, which will appear shortly under the title "Brother 
and Sister." 

" The Hand of Ethelberta," with an etched frontis- 
piece and the usual map of Wessex, appears in Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers' standard library edition of the 
novels of Mr. Thomas Hardy. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. have added " Maud " and 
" In Memoriam " to their " People's " edition of Ten- 
nyson, and "A Happy Boy," translated by Mrs. W. 
Archer, to their new edition of Herr Bjornson's novels. 

Mr. H. Heathcote Statham's " Architecture for Gen- 
eral Readers " (Scribner) has passed into a second and 
revised edition. It is an admirable book for the general 
reader, treating of theory and history in about equal 
measure. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. announce for early publica- 
tion a new novel by Mrs. Alexander, entitled " A Fight 
with Fate." The same firm will issue " The Ebbing of 
the Tide," a new story by Louis Becke, and " The Fail- 
ure of Sibyl Fletcher," an English story by Adeline 
Sergeant. 

" The Congregationalist " for March 12 is a sixty- 
four page number, in celebration of the eighty completed 
years of its existence. In a series of ably-written spe- 
cial articles the progress of the century in religion, edu- 
cation, and politics is summarized. The paper claims 
to be the oldest religious journal in existence. 

A new edition of the late Dr. Alfred Edersheim's 
" History of the Jewish Nation after the Destruction of 
Jerusalem under Titus " (Longmans) has been prepared 
under the supervision of the Rev. Henry A. White. 



The work, in its original form, dates from 1856, and 
has long had rank among histories of standard value. 

The Managing Committee of the American School of 
Classical studies in Rome will offer for the year 1896-7 
three fellowships, of five hundred and six hundred dollars 
each. Applicants may obtain further information from 
Professor S. B. Plainer, Western Reserve University, 
Cleveland. All applications must be filed by May 1, 
1896. 

A third edition of Messrs. Lindley and Widney's 
" California of the South," first published in the days of 
the great " boom " of 1887, brings the work up to date, 
and affords the visitor or intending settler an invaluable 
compendium of facts, presented in readable and attract- 
ive arrangement. Messrs. Appleton & Co. are the pub- 
lishers. 

Mr. Henry Altemus, of Philadelphia, publishes three 
pretty booklets in his " Belles Lettres " series that are of 
timely interest. One is an address by Mr. Carl Schurz 
on " The Spoils System," another is Mr. Richard Olney's 
paper on " The Scholar in Politics," while the third is 
by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, and has " Independence 
Day " for its subject. 

Philip J. A. Harper, the senior member of the firm 
of Harper & Brothers, died at his home in Hempstead, 
L. I., on the 6th of March. He was born in 1824, and 
had been connected with the firm which bears his name 
since 1842, having been a partner in the house since 
1869, when he took the place of his father, James Har- 
per. Mr. Harper retired from active business life some 
years ago. 

An extremely attractive new edition of the " Decline 
and Fall," edited by Professor J. B. Bury, is to mark 
the Gibbon Centenary. The work will occupy seven 
volumes, and the editor's name warrants the belief that it 
will be at all points abreast with the latest and most 
accurate scholarship. The volume now published (Mac- 
millan) is delightful in paper, print, and binding, and in 
every way worthy of the masterwork of literature which 
it sets out to reprint. 

Judge Hughes, the well-known and widely-beloved 
author of " Tom Brown's Schooldays," died on the 22d 
of March, at the age of seventy-three. Everyone knows 
that he was a boy at Rugby, and that he established the 
Rugby colony in Tennessee. Not so many are acquainted 
with his career as a member of Parliament from 1865 
to 1874, and as an occupant of the bench from 1882 to 
the time of his death. Chicago owes him a peculiar 
debt of gratitude for his collection from English authors 
and publishers of the several thousands of volumes that 
formed the beginning of her great Public Library. His 
service in this matter, coming just after the Great Fire 
of 1871, was as timely as it was graceful, and has always 
been warmly appreciated. His writings include, besides 
the Tom Brown books, " The Scouring of the White 
Horse," " Alfred the Great," " A Layman's Faith," and 
several other publications. 

In an editorial article in its issue of March 21, " The 
Publishers' Weekly " says : " There is no name in the 
annals of the American book trade more justly honored 
than that of Putnam. The founder of the publishing 
house bearing that name George Palmer Putnam 
may not, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, have 
been a very successful business man; measured, how- 
ever, by the devotion of his whole life to the encourage- 
ment and development of literature and to its dissem- 
ination, his was an eminently successful career. . . .

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



The missionary spirit which dominated the elder Mr. 
Putnam's life he transmitted in full measure to his 
children. Few American families can show in the sec- 
ond generation a more useful working altruism than that 
which dominates the lives of these children George 
Haven Putnam and his brothers in the firm; Herbert 
Putnam, now at the head of the Boston Public Library; 
Mrs. Mary Putnam-Jacobi, one of the two women who 
first stormed the doors of the French Academy of Medi- 
cine, and opened them to her sex, and whose career in 
the practice of medicine and as a writer has been most 
noteworthy; and Miss Ruth Putnam, whose literary 
work has been much more extended and helpful than 
the volumes bearing her name would show not to 
speak of other brothers and sisters whose names are 
less publicly known." Apropos of the literary work of 
the elder son, the article adds: " Already the author of 
an authoritative work on The Question of Copyright ' 
a subject on which his father in 1840 published what 
is regarded as the first pamphlet written by an Ameri- 
can on the subject as well as a practical manual for 
authors and publishers, George Haven Putnam has 
more recently, through an important work on ' Authors 
and Their Public in Ancient Times,' and a forthcoming 
work on Books and Their Makers During the Middle 
Ages,' become the historian of the book trade from its 
earliest beginning."

THE 



STEARNS BICYCLE 



IS 



The Epitome of Comfort, 

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the "easy-running Stearns"; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, the better it is liked.

THE SUPPLY AT SAINT 
AGATHA'S. 

By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS, author of " A Singular 
Life," " The Gates Ajar," etc. Printed on deckle- 
edge paper of high quality, and artistically bound in 
cloth, with a distinctive cover design by Mrs. WHIT- 
MAN. With Illustrations. Square 12mo, gilt top, 
$1.00. 

This is one of the strongest, most suggestive, most illumi- 
nating of all the stories Miss Phelps has written. The setting 
of the story is vigorous and skilful, the narrative is engross- 
ingly interesting, and the revelation of the " Supply " at once 
startles and uplifts. The book is in every way artistic, and is 
admirable for an Easter gift. 

KOKORO :

By LAFCADIO HEARN, author of " Glimpses of Unfa- 
miliar Japan," " Out of the East," etc. A noticeably 
beautiful book. 16mo, gilt top, $1.25. 

This book, by a very keen observer and brilliant writer, 
deals largely with tendencies and traits illustrated, if not de- 
veloped, by the war between Japan and China ; and it is thus 
a valuable contribution toward a just appreciation of the 
Japan of to-day.

A GREAT BOOK. 

MORAL EVOLUTION. 

By GEORGE HARRIS, D.D., Professor in the Andover 

Theological Seminary. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

" Christian theorists who have been troubled by the theories 
and claims of evolutionists will find an antidote for their 
troubles in this marvellously clear and lucid exposition of the 
claims of both essential Christianity and Evolution, and of 
the perfect harmony which exists between them." Boston 
Advertiser. 

" The style is cogent and brilliant, the thought is deep, and 
a splendid array of learning, with important ideas and facts, 
is presented readably in a moderate compass." Worcester 
Spy. 

" Whether viewed in its scientific or religions bearings, or 
in the application it has to current social ideals, the work is 
one of the most significant of any that have appeared in its par- 
ticular field for some time. One might almost venture to say 
of it that it includes the elements of a new philosophy."

A NEW VIRGINIA ROMANCE. 

WHITE APRONS. 

A Romance of Bacon's Rebellion, Virginia, 1676. 

By MAUD WILDER GOODWIN, author of The Head of a Hundred," The Colonial Cavalier," etc. 

12mo, cloth extra, gilt top, $1.25. 

The scene of Mrs. Goodwin's new story is in part Virginia and in part the Court of Charles the Second. The historical 
basis of the romance is the episode known as " Bacon's Rebellion," in the time of Governor Berkeley, but the author has 
woven into it a charming love story and given the whole narrative much dramatic interest. At the Court of Charles II. the 
heroine meets with many notable men, among them being the King, Buckingham, Kneller, Dryden, and Mr. Samuel Pepys. 
Mrs. Goodwin has produced a romance even more delightful than her successful story, " The Head of a Hundred."

Geographical Society of Vienna. With numerous Illustrations from Photographs taken by the Author, and 
Maps. 8vo, cloth, 5.00. 

Mr. William Astor Chapter's description of his travels and Explorations in Eastern Africa forms one of the most deeply 
interesting books published in recent years. Mr. Ghanler and his companion, Lieutenant von Hb'hmel, himself a noted explorer, 
were the first white men to penetrate into mamy of the regions here described, and the account of their adventures and perils, 
their achievements and their misfortunes, forms a narrative fascinating, not alone to the traveller and the scientist, but also, 
and more especially, to the sportsman and to the lover of exciting romance.

THE TRIUMPH OF THE NOVELIST. 

During the greater part of the nineteenth 
century the novel has been the most distinctive 
of literary forms. Historians of literature have 
so amply recognized the fact and critics have 
so copiously moralized over it that the subject 
has become almost as hackneyed as that of the 
weather. The Puritan prejudice against novel- 
reading, once almost as potent as the Moham- 
medan injunction against graphic portrayal of 
the human form, has so completely vanished 
from the general consciousness of the public 
that we look with curious wonder at the belated 
preacher who still here and there voices a pro- 
test that would have found much support a 
generation or two ago, and that now falls upon 
absolutely unheeding ears. We read novels 
nowadays as a matter of course, just as we go 
to the theatre and eat mince pies, although all 
of these practices were condemned by the sterner 
morality of our forefathers. And not only do 
we read novels without compunctions of con- 
science, but we are actually encouraged to read 
them by those to whom we look for intellectual 
and spiritual guidance. Our high schools and 
colleges prescribe courses in novel-reading, and 
our clergymen take them as texts for their ser- 
mons in a sense very different from that in which 
they used to be taken by gentlemen of the cloth 
trained in the traditions of an older school. 

While nineteenth-century readers have been, 
as a class, almost universally addicted to the 
fiction-habit, there is no reason for thinking 
that the readers of the twentieth century will 
be any the less so addicted. Philosophical 
critics sometimes tell us that the novel will run 
its course and be replaced by something else, 
just as the drama and the poem and the essay 
have at other times and in other lands run their 
respective courses, and lapsed from favor. But 
these critics do not give us any very definite 
forecast of what the coming literary fashion is 
to be, and the novelist meanwhile snaps his fin- 
gers at all such iconoclasts. He simply keeps 
on producing what the public wants, with small 
regard for the opinions of those who tell us 
what the public ought to want. He has ridden 
upon the top wave of prosperity to the very 
verge of a new century, and it is his evident 
intention to carry into that century the prac- 



226 



[April 16, 



tice of the arts whereby his conspicuous for- 
tunes have heretofore been achieved. Nearly 
all the prizes of the literary life come to him, 
and he finds it very pleasant to have them. 
Yachts and villas and other expensive luxuries 
are within his reach, and he looks down with 
patrician pride upon the poor poet in his garret, 
or upon the mere thinker whose intellectual 
work is done in the hours that can be spared 
from the uncongenial toil upon which he must 
depend for subsistance. 

A reflective person, contrasting the posi- 
tion of the popular novelist with that occupied 
by the scholar whose strenuous pursuit of truth 
receives but slight recognition from his gener- 
ation, can hardly refrain from a certain indig- 
nation at so unequal a distribution of the gifts 
of fortune. The fiction-writer who succeeds in 
catching the popular ear finds his path made 
easy ever thereafter. Intellectually he may be 
one of the feeblest of mortals, yet the halo 
of fame encircles his head for the time, and he 
may with comparative impunity wax oracular 
even upon subjects of which he is most densely 
ignorant. On the other hand the quiet thinker 
must struggle to get an audience, even for 
ideas which he is perhaps the best-qualified man 
in the world to express, and may count himself 
fortunate if his laborious days earn for him an 
existence of the most precarious and exiguous 
sort. He does, indeed, take comfort in the as- 
surance that his work is done for a posterity 
that will have forgotten the very name of the 
writer who now basks in the sun of popular 
favor, and in this faith may find strength to 
scorn the delights of the present day, but his 
task is none the less a thankless one, and the 
age is none the less dishonored that makes it 
such. Think, for example, of what the world 
has done for Mr. Rider Haggard and Mr. Her- 
bert Spencer. A few novels, considered as lit- 
erature almost beneath contempt, have earned 
for the one many times over what has been 
earned for the other by the forty years that 
have gone to the building up of one of the most 
imposing and substantial edifices of thought 
ever added to the possessions of mankind. 
Doubtless, this material view of the reward of 
effort is not the only view that should be taken, 
but the lives of most men are so hedged about 
by material limitations and conditioned by ma- 
terial necessities that it must be reckoned with 
in determining the balance of justice between 
every man and his contemporaries. 

If the triumph of the novelist were a condi- 
tion that concerned only the best producers, 



there would not be so much cause to rail at the 
degeneracy of an age that exalts the writer of 
fiction over literary workers of other classes. 
Fiction, at its highest, is one of the noblest of 
the arts, and it would be difficult to bestow recog- 
nition too generous upon a Scott or a Thack- 
eray, a Balzac or a Tourguenieff, a George 
Eliot or a George Sand. But the deserved 
triumph of such writers is attended by an ab- 
surdly exaggerated estimate of the hosts of the 
undeserving. The whole mass of contemporary 
fiction benefits by the lift given the art by its 
masters, few in number as they are. And the 
best writers are by no means the most success- 
ful. Mr. Hardy and Mr. Meredith are far less 
popular than Mr. Hall Caine and Mr. Rider 
Haggard, although the latter are mere bunglers, 
while the former, for all their perversities, are 
artists of distinctive genius. The attitude of 
our present-day public towards fiction-writers 
as a class encourages the notion that anybody 
knows enough to write a novel, and this notion, 
which might otherwise be harmless enough, is 
made perniciously effective by the publishers, 
who make it possible for almost anybody to get 
a novel printed. And so we have every year new 
novels by the hundreds, by the thousands, novels 
that have not the slightest claim upon any gen- 
uine intellectual interest, preposterous inven- 
tions that can only blunt the artistic sense of 
those who are foolish enough to read them, 
exploitations of every variety of diseased fancy 
and perverted imagination, guides to the con- 
duct of life by young persons who know noth- 
ing of life themselves, books written with no 
higher aim than amusement that are too dull 
even to achieve that aim, productions of incom- 
petent scribblers who might have found honest 
employment in farming or in housekeeping, and 
made their activities of some real use to society. 
Professor Brander Matthews, in a recent 
magazine article, draws an ingenious parallel 
between the art of novel-writing and the game 
of whist. Dr. Pole recognizes four stages in 
the evolution of whist, the Primitive Game, 
the Game of Hoyle, the Philosophical Game, 
and the Latter-day Improvements. Four stages, 
not dissimilar to these, may be recognized in 
the evolution of the novel. Professor Matthews 
dubs them the Impossible, the Improbable, 
the Probable, and the Inevitable stages. The 
"Arabian Nights," "Les Trois Mousque- 
taires," " Vanity Fair," and " The Scarlet Let- 
ter," are given as examples of the four kinds 
of fiction. But, just as all four forms of the 
game are still practised by different sets of 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

players, the later having failed to displace the 
earlier ones, so all the four forms of fiction are 
still produced by different sets of writers, and 
each still finds its own public. The parallel is 
interesting, and reasonably justified by the 
facts, but its formulator should have added that 
there is, and always has been, a fifth kind of 
fiction, corresponding to the variety of whist 
known as bumblepuppy. And our pride in the 
developments that the art of fiction has unques- 
tionably made during the last half -century must 
be considerably tempered when we reflect that 
the great mass of modern novels comes from 
writers who do not play the game in accordance 
with the rules of any system, primitive or phi- 
losophical. In a word, the ascendancy of fiction 
in our latter-day literary production is not alto- 
gether the mark of a heightened appreciation of 
art. The triumph of the novelist is, to a consid- 
erable degree, a triumph of ineptitude over abil- 
ity, of lower over higher ideals, of slovenly over 
painstaking workmanship, of incoherence and 
disproportion over measured and organic art. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE RED BADGE OF HYSTERIA. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Must we come to judge of books only by what the 
newspapers have said of them, and must we abandon all 
the old standards of criticism ? Can a book and an au- 
thor, utterly without merit, be puffed into success by 
entirely undeserved praise, even if that praise come 
from English periodicals ? 

One must ask these questions after he has been se- 
duced into reading a book recently reprinted in this 
country entitled " The Red Badge of Courage, an Epi- 
sode of the American Civil War." The chorus of praise 
in the English papers has been very extravagant, but 
it is noticeable that so far, at least, the American pa- 
pers have said very little about the merits or demerits 
of the book itself. They simply allude to the noise 
made over it abroad, and therefore treat its author as 
a, coming factor in our literature. Even THE DIAL'S 
very acute and usually very discerning critic of contem- 
porary fiction (Mr. Payne) treats the book and the au- 
thor (in your issue of Feb. 1) in very much this way 
that is, as a book and an author to be reckoned with, 
not because of any good which he himself finds in them, 
but because they have been so much talked about. 

The book has very recently been reprinted in America, 
and would seem to be an American book, on an Amer- 
ican theme, and by an American author, yet originally 
issued in England. If it is really an American produc- 
tion one must suppose it to have been promptly and 
properly rejected by any American publishers to whom 
it may have been submitted, and afterward more natur- 
ally taken up by an English publisher. 

It is only too well known that English writers have 
had a very low opinion of American soldiers, and have 
always, as a rule, assumed to ridicule them. " Black- 
wood's Magazine " is quoted by a recent writer as saying 



during the War: " We cannot even pretend to keep our 
countenance when the exploits of the Grand Army of the 
Potomac are filling all Europe with inextinguishable 
laughter," and adds " we know not whether to pity most 
the officers who lead such men, or the men who are led 
by such officers " (Vol. 90, pp. 395-6). And again, in 
January, 1862 : " Englishmen are unable to see anything 
peculiarly tragical in the fact that half a million of men 
have been brought together in arms to hurl big words at 
each other across a river" (Vol. 91, p. 118). Again, in 
April, 1862, " Blackwood " tells us that Americans " do 
not demand our respect because of their achievements in 
art, or in literature, or in science, or philosophy. They 
can make no pretence to the no less real, though less 
beneficent, reputation of. having proved themselves a 
great military power" (Vol. 91, p. 534). And in Oc- 
tober, 1861, "Blackwood " said exultantly: "The ven- 
erable Lincoln, the respectable Seward, the raving 
editors, the gibbering mob, and the swift-footed warriors 
of Bull's Run, are no malicious tricks of fortune, played 
off on an unwary nation, but are all of them the legiti- 
mate offspring of the Great Republic," and is " glad 
that the end of the Union seems more likely to be ridic- 
ulous than terrible " (Vol. 90, p. 396). 

We all know with what bitterness and spitefulness 
the "Saturday Review" always treats Americans; and 
with what special vindictiveness it reviews any book 
upon our late struggle written from the Northern stand- 
point. And so it is with all British periodicals and all 
British writers. They are so puffed up with vain-glory 
over their own soldiers who seldom meet men of their 
own strength, but are used in every part of the world 
for attacking and butchering defenseless savages, who 
happen to possess some property that Englishmen covet, 
that they cannot believe that there can be among any 
peoples well-disciplined soldiers as gallant and cour- 
ageous as their own. 

Under such circumstances we cannot doubt that 
" The Red Badge of Courage " would be just such a 
book as the English would grow enthusiastic over, and 
we cannot wonder that the redoubtable " Saturday Re- 
view " greeted it with the highest encomiums, and de- 
clared it the actual experiences of a veteran of our War, 
when it was really the vain imaginings of a young 
man born long since that war, a piece of intended real- 
ism based entirely on unreality. The book is a vicious 
satire upon American soldiers and American armies. 
The hero of the book (if such he can be called " the 
youth " the author styles him) is an ignorant and 
stupid country lad, who, without a spark of patriotic 
feeling, or even of soldierly ambition, has enlisted in 
the army from no definite motive that the reader can 
discover, unless it be because other boys are doing so; 
and the whole book, in which there is absolutely no story, 
is occupied with giving what are supposed to be his 
emotions and his actions in the first two days of battle. 
His poor weak intellect, if indeed he has any, seems to 
be at once and entirely overthrown by the din and move- 
ment of the field, and he acts throughout like a mad- 
man. Under the influence of mere excitement, for he 
does not even appear to be frightened, he first rushes 
madly to the rear in a crazy panic, and afterward plunges 
forward to the rescue of the colors under exactly the 
same influences. In neither case has reason or any 
intelligent motive any influence on his action. He is 
throughout an idiot or a maniac, and betrays no trace 
of the reasoning being. No thrill of patriotic devotion 
to cause or country erer moves his breast, and not even 
an emotion of manly courage. Even a wound which he 



228

finally gets comes from a comrade who strikes him on 
the head with his musket to get rid of him; and this 
is the only " Red Badge of Courage " (!) which we dis- 
cover in the book. A number of other characters come 
in to fill out the two hundred and thirty-three pages of 
the book, such as " the loud soldier," " the tall sol- 
dier," " the tattered soldier," etc., but not one of them 
betrays any more sense, self-possession, or courage than 
does " the youth." On the field all is chaos and con- 
fusion. " The young lieutenant," " the mounted offi- 
cer," even " the general," are all utterly demented be- 
ings, raving and talking alike in an unintelligible and 
hitherto unheard-of jargon, rushing about in a very de- 
lirium of madness. No intelligent orders are given; 
no intelligent movements are made. There is no evi- 
dence of drill, none of discipline. There is a constant, 
senseless, and profane babbling going on, such as one 
could hear nowhere but in a madhouse. Nowhere are 
seen the quiet, manly, self-respecting, and patriotic men, 
influenced by the highest sense of duty, who in reality 
fought our battles. 

It can be said most confidently that no soldier who 
fought in our recent War ever saw any approach to the 
battle scenes in this book but what wonder ? We are 
told that it is the work of a young man of twenty-three 
or twenty-four years of age, and so of course must be a 
mere work of diseased imagination. And yet it con- 
stantly strains after so-called realism. The result is a 
mere riot of words. 

Although its burlesques and caricatures are quite 
enough to dismiss it from attention, it is worth while to 
give some samples of its diction to show that there is in 
it an entire lack of any literary quality. Notice the vio- 
lent straining after effect in the mere unusual associa- 
tion of words, in the forced and distorted use of adjec- 
tives. Notice, too, the absurd similes, and even the bad 
grammar. Startling sentences are so frequent they might 
be quoted indefinitely; but here are a few: 

" A brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action 
with a rending roar. It was as if it had exploded " (p. 45.) 

" The lieutenant of the youth's company was shot in the hand. 
He began to swear so wondrously that a nervous laugh went 
along the regimental line. The officer's profanity sounded con- 
ventional. It relieved the tightened senses of the new men. It 
was as if he had hit his fingers with a tack hammer at home"(p49). 

" Another [mounted officer] was galloping about bawling. 
His hat was gone, and his clothes were awry. He resembled a 
man who has come from bed to go to afire. The hoofs of his horse 
often threatened the heads of the running men, but they scam- 
pered with singular fortune. In this rush they were apparently 
all deaf and blind. They heeded not the largest and longest of 
oaths which were thrown at them from all directions " (p. 51 ) . 

"The battle reflection that shone for an instant in the 
faces on the mad current made the youth feel that forceful 
hands from heaven would not have been able to have held 
him in place if he could have got intelligent control of his 
legs" (p. 52). 

" A small thrillful boy" (p. 53). 

" The cartridge-boxes were pulled around into various po- 
sitions, and adjusted with great care. It was as if seven hun- 
dred new bonnets were being tried on " (p. 53). 

" Buried in the smoke of many rifles, his anger was directed 
not so much against the men whom he knew were rushing to- 
ward him as against the swishing battle phantoms which were 
choking him, stuffing their smoke robes down his parched 
throat" (p. 57). 

" There was a blare of heated rage " (p. 58). 

" The officers at their intervals rearward . . . were bobbing 
to and fro roaring directions. The dimensions of their howls 
were extraordinary" (p. 59). 

"To the youth it was like an onslaught of redoubtable 
dragons. He became like the man who lost his legs at the 



approach of the red and green monster. He waited in a sort 
of horrified, listening attitude. He seemed to shut his eyes, 
and wait to be gobbled " (p. 68). 

"A crimson roar came from a distance " (p. 82). 

" With the courageous words of the artillery and the spite- 
ful sentences of the musketry mingled red cheers" (p. 85). 

" The youth had reached an anguish when the sobs scorched 
him" (p. 94). 

" They were ever up-raising the ghost of shame on the stick 
of their curiosity" (p. 104). 

"The new silence of his wound made much worryment' r 
(P. 124). 

"The distance was splintering and blaring with the noise 
of fighting" (p. 139). 

"... began to mutter softly in black curses" (p. 201). 

" His corpse would be for those eyes a great and salt re- 
proach" (p. 215). 

It is extraordinary that even a prejudiced animus 
could have led English writers to lavish extravagant 
praise on such a book; it is still more extraordinary that 
an attempt should be made to foist it upon the long- 
suffering American public, and to push it into popularity 
here. Respect for our own people should have pre- 
vented its issue in this country. 

There may have been a moderate number of men in 
our service who felt and acted in battle like those in thia 
book; but of such deserters were made. They did not 
stay when they could get away : why should they ? The 
army was no healthy place for them, and they had no 
reason to stay ; there was no moral motive. After they 
had deserted, however, they remained " loud soldiers," 
energetic, and blatant, and they are possibly now en- 
joying good pensions. It must have been some of these 
fellows who got the ear of Mr. Crane and told him how 
they felt and acted in battle. A. C. McC.

EXTENSION AND INTENSION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The sole purpose of the present brief screed is to 
suggest a modification in the general method of con- 
ducting Summer Schools, and in the work of those Ex- 
tension centres which give several courses during a sin- 
gle year; possibly, also, in the reading system of the 
Chautauqua circles. Would it not be practicable, and 
wise, to concentrate the studies of such a student-body, 
for at least a year, upon a single large but sufficiently 
limited topic in literature, history, or science ? The 
query is no doubt a mere familiar echo, but I hope to 
give it a more definite and practical tone. 

A syllabus might be carefully prepared as a guide 
for two or three months' previous reading. The sum- 
mer's (or winter's) lecture courses should be given by 
men who are competent specialists, but still men of suf- 
ficiently wide and, let us add, sufficiently harmonious 
views. Each lecturer would, of course, offer his stu- 
dents a bibliography far more than sufficient for six 
months' subsequent reading. In all cases where ex- 
tended reading is suggested, the varying needs of the 
trained or untrained, elementary and advanced students, 
should be carefully considered. Two books might suf- 
fice for some, while others could master twenty. A 
final examination (perhaps usually at Easter), and a 
certificate for those passing it, should crown the work. 
This test might well consist in a goodly number of 
far-reaching general questions, from which the student 
need select but a small proportion. These could best 
be answered in the form of briefer or more sustained 
theses, prepared with the freest use of all the books or 
other assistance available. Personal correspondence,

the travelling libraries, and every other aid possible, 
should be invoked by the isolated workers. 

This proposal is in the line of a familiar educational 
maxim: " Know one thing thoroughly, and refer every- 
thing else to that." Certainly a year is all too brief 
for the full attainment of any such ideal: but a far 
greater continuity would be reached than is now even 
attempted. In some cases a second year's work would 
grow naturally out of the first; e. g., in history, after a 
study of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, the 
present conditions in European political life might be out- 
lined in a second campaign. Similarly, " Rome under the 
triumvirates " would lead naturally to "The condition of 
mankind as organized under the early Roman empire." 
Possibly a truly encyclopaedic course, continued through 
a long series of years, might measurably cover at least 
the chief lessons of the past, as handed on to the life of 
the present. Thus, for belles lettres, in eight or ten succes- 
sive years, Homer, Greek drama, Latin poetry of the 
first century B. c., Dante, French classical drama, the 
school of Weimar, and the other greatest masterpieces 
of foreign literatures, might be read carefully by all, 
in translation, and discussed in philosophic spirit by 
those who best know each poet in his own especial en- 
vironment, and in his original voice. 

Those who realize most fully the continuity of his- 
tory, also, may be no less willing to throw a brighter light, 
in succession, upon the heroic, the picturesque, the car- 
dinal epochs in the long story of man's life on earth. 

Perhaps three or more widely diverse courses let 
us say one in literature, one in history, one in science 
might be presented simultaneously, and a few students, 
exceptionally well prepared by previous training, or 
enjoying a larger leisure, might be free to elect two, or 
even three. The working out of such a scheme in de- 
tail, and the preparation of the courses, would require 
the united efforts of an entire academic faculty, at least, 
if not a selected national body of scholars. Yet it seems 
necessary even here to add tentatively a few illustra- 
tions, if only to bring the proposed plan fairly under 
discussion. 

In science, such a general topic as origin of species, 
or the theory of heredity, aerial navigation, or the ap- 
plications of electricity in locomotion, or the possibility 
of organic life on the other planets, could perhaps be 
made the centre about which much general instruction 
in biology, physics, or descriptive astronomy could be 
given, even to students not trained for advanced special 
studies. Competent teachers of those branches must 
decide how far they can be profitably pursued outside 
the laboratories of a fully equipped university. The 
writer confesses, however, that he shares the feeling in 
favor of history (including civics, sociology, etc.), and 
literature, as above all else the common ground for gen- 
eral interest and popular culture. These two subjects 
could indeed be pursued jointly, so as to throw a con- 
stant cross-light upon each other. Thus the Greek trag- 
edy and comedy, and the political life of Athens in the 
fifth century, or, still better, mediaeval Italy and Dante's 
poem, might well be studied together. On the whole, 
however, a complete divorce might here be still better 
than union : for while the historical topics would perhaps 
be better chosen from modern epochs, literature must in 
every sense begin with the Greeks. 

If, however, as is natural, Homer were the centre of 
a first year's work, a special series of lectures on pre- 
historic archaeological data, possibly another on the his- 
torical and chronological deductions from the poems, 



would be no less essential than some comparative dis- 
cussion of the " Niebelungen " and other early epics. We 
might well call to our aid all the scholars of America, 
in composing an adequate syllabus for every such course, 
and especially in preparing the thirty topics from which 
five to ten might be selected for the pass examination. 
These topics should be such as to encourage wide read- 
ing, carried on for definite ends. They should appeal 
skilfully also to the most varied interests and special 
predilections. Let me venture, in closing, to offer a few 
suggestions for such questions. They may serve also to 
illustrate the kind of specialism here advocated. No 
excuse will be needed for returning once again to the 
writer's favorite field to seek examples. 

Thus a study of Helen's character as she appears in 
the " Iliad " and " Odyssey," in Euripides's tragedy, and 
Goethe's " Faust," while quite large enough for the ma- 
turest specialist in comparative literature, could yet be 
attempted by any intelligent man or woman with Palmer 
or Butcher and Lang, E. P. Coleridge's prose or Way's 
verse for Euripides, and Bayard Taylor's masterly echo 
of Goethe, in his hands. The use of the precious metals 
in Homer might interest the student of ethnology, of 
art, or of metallurgy. The comparative moral eleva- 
tion of gods and men in the " Iliad " might run into a 
discussion how far the divine element in the poem is 
mere tradition accepted from more savage ancestors, 
while Andromache and Hector are drawn with free hand 
as the refined poet's own ideals. A thesis on the posi- 
tion of woman in epic, in tragedy, in real Athenian life, 
might reach down to a discussion of the new American 
woman of the present decade. 

It is not, I think, peculiarly important to limit the 
range of thought, at least in the popular education of 
adults; but it certainly is desirable to focalize the atten- 
tion, to give a more robust and prolonged unity to home- 
study of every sort, to devise dignified and scholarly 
means to show the real progress made and the benefits 
derived. Hinc illce nugce I W. C. LAWTON.

DEFOE'S "JOURNAL OF THE PLAQUE" AS A 

SCHOOL CLASSIC. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Here are a few quotations from Defoe's " Journal of 
the Plague Year," which our young people are reading 
in preparation for admission to college. " Northampton, 
whence our family first came from "; " and who to trust 
my affairs with"; "cautious who they took into their 
houses "; " they were sure persons would die in so short 
a time; and could not live"; "this was nine weeks 
asunder "; " Solomon Eagle . . . had his own wife died 
the very next day of the plague," meaning, " Solomon 
Eagle's wife died." 

These pleonasms, blunders in the use of the relative, 
and similar results of haste, are sprinkled thickly 
throughout the book; they characterize it. The arrange- 
ment of the matter is confused and repetitious. The 
discussion of the statistics gleaned from the bills of 
mortality is tedious. I, for one, protest against fixing 
the thought of young people upon so ghastly a story, 
which cannot be made healthy food for the mind by 
mixing in occasional paragraphs of religious mysticism. 
And so I advise all teachers of preparatory English to 
exercise the discretion allowed them by the universi- 
ties, and substitute some equivalent for this unworthy 
"classic." A. C. BARROWS.

THE LETTERS OF ERNEST AND HENRIETTE 
REN AN.* 



The Memoir of Henriette Renan which Lady 
Mary Loyd has prefixed to her graceful trans- 
lation of Henriette's correspondence with her 
brother is the reproduction of a pamphlet of 
which Ernest Renan had a hundred copies 
printed in 1862 under the title, " Henriette 
Renan : A Memorial for those who knew her." 
Touching this pamphlet M. Renan observes in 
his " Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse ": 

" The person who has had most influence on my life 
my sister Henriette scarcely appears in this work 
of mine. A year after the death of that beloved being 
I wrote a little pamphlet, consecrated to her memory, 
for the benefit of the few who had known her. My sister 
was so modest, her aversion to the bustle of the world 
was so extreme, that if I had offered these pages to the 
general public I should have fancied her casting re- 
proaches on me from the grave. ... It seemed to me 
I should do as wrong by the insertion of these pages in 
a book placed on the open market, as if I exhibited her 
portrait in an auction room. The pamphlet will not be 
reprinted, therefore, till after I am dead." 

In a codicil to his will M. Renan authorized 
the present reprint, which was prepared by 
Madame Renan, who also selected the letters. 
The Memoir is a beautiful and touching record 
of sisterly devotion and self-effacement, tinged 
perhaps with a little fond exaggeration of gifts 
and qualities to which the writer owed much. 
Henriette Renan was what may be termed a 
moral genius ; for genius is not of the intellect 
alone. Had circumstances permitted her to 
indulge her early bent towards the conventual 
life, the aureola of sainthood might well have 
been hers. " She never," says her brother, 
" knew any pleasures save those she drew from 
the practice of virtue and from the heart's 
affections." Hers, in fine, was one of those 
rare souls which seem created to assure us that 
the moral impulse, the saving human capacity 
or tendency to make the pains and the joys of 
others one's own, however lowly in its origin and 
as yet confined and imperfect in its manifesta- 
tion, is still capable of a boundless development 
that points to a hopeful future for the race. 

Henriette Renan was born at Treguier in the 
year 1811, her brother twelve years later. Her 
life was shadowed early ; and the natural mel- 
ancholy of her temperament left her little taste 
for lighter amusements, and even inspired her 

* BHOTHBK AJJD SISTER : A Memoir and the Letters of 
Ernest and Henriette Renan. Translated by Lady Mary Loyd. 
Illustrated. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



with a certain inclination to shun the world and 
its delights. Yet her modest withdrawal from 
the bustle and levities of life was remote enough 
from the ascetic Christian's sour renunciation 
of the flesh. For her keenest pleasures (aside 
from those resting in good works and self- 
denial) still sprang from a rich appreciation of 
nature a fine day, a sunbeam, a flower, suf- 
ficing to delight her. And she had to the last, 
says her brother, despite a life replete with tears 
and toil and serious thought, now and then her 
charming womanly flashes. 

" Her youth would return to her for the nonce ; she 
would seem to smile at life, and the veil that parted her 
from it would drop. These passing moments of en- 
chanting weakness, fleeting gleams of a dawn long past, 
were full of melancholy tenderness. . . . She loved life, 
she was full of good taste, she could smile over some 
womanly trifle as she would smile over a flower." 

At seventeen Henriette embraced the career 
of a professional teacher " the bitterest of all 
others." The tragic death of her father in 
1828 (a sailor of the Republic, he met the fate 
of his calling, and lies buried beneath the sands 
near Erqui where the sea cast him up) left the 
little family in poverty. From that time forth, 
says M. Renan, " she looked upon herself as 
responsible for my future." 

" Noticing my awkward movements one day, she per- 
ceived I was striving shyly to conceal the rents in a 
worn-out garment. She burst into tears. The sight of 
the poor child, destined to such black poverty, with in- 
stincts so removed therefrom, wrung her heart. She 
resolved to face the struggle with life, and undertook 
the task of filling up, by her unaided efforts, the abyss 
our father's misfortunes had opened at our feet." 

How nobly she faced that struggle ; how her 
efforts were crowned at last with the modest 
triumph she craved the independence of those 
she loved ; how solely through her toil and self- 
sacrifice her brother was enabled to tread the 
path that led to his future fame, the Memoir 
eloquently sets forth. 

Constant study, M. Renan tells us, produced 
in his sister " a prodigious mental develop- 
ment," and a corresponding modification of her 
early religious ideas. 

"From history she learnt the insufficiency of any 
dogma; but the fundamental religious sentiment, which 
was hers by nature, as well as by reason of her early 
education, was too deeply rooted to be shaken." 

Perhaps she passed into a phase of exalted 
deism, like that of the " Savoyard Vicar," which 
has singular attractions for natures like hers ; 
but her Catholic convictions certainly soon tot- 
tered to their fall. She inclined, says M. Renan, 
" to view the very clerical bent of my educa- 
tion with some regret." How soon she was

THE DIAL 



231 



destined to learn from her brother the baseless- 
ness of that regret, the story of his own pain- 
ful progress in the thorny path of doubt in 
which she had outstripped him, and of his step- 
by-step relinquishment of the ecclesiastical ca- 
reer, those who have read his charming " Sou- 
venirs " already know. For ten years, from 
1840 to 1850, Henriette was governess in a 
noble family in Poland ; and it was during this 
period that most of the letters in the present 
collection were written. In them one may 
trace the progress of the mental change that 
finally impelled M. Renan to renounce a career 
he could not in conscience follow. So early as 
1844 he writes, after confessing the scruples 
that beset him regarding an impending step in 
his ecclesiastical advance : 

" Amidst the lively controversies now occupying pub- 
lic opinion in this country, and which I look on as part 
of the frivolous pabulum indispensable to those whose 
passions need some special stimulant, ... I have suc- 
ceeded in forming an opinion (on religious societies) as 
far removed from the frantic declamation of those who 
love to see mystery where none exists, as from the ab- 
surd panegyrics lavished by those small minds who see 
the type of sovereign perfection in a very human insti- 
tution. Both parties seem to me equally ignorant of 
the two great laws of human nature: 1st. That whoever 
thinks to find a human work under whatever name, 
be it even that of Jesus Christ whatever its avowed 
object, even the saintliest whatever means, even the 
purest, serve its ends in which the human passions, 
their influence and their action, have no share, seeks the 
impossible. 2nd. That whereas humanity eternally pro- 
gresses, and such institutions remain stationary, it inev- 
itably follows that those of one century must be out of 
harmony with the next, and that to attempt to keep 
them going is like trying to warm a corpse, and is a 
proof of extreme folly." 

In a letter of the following year he informs 
his sister that he has refused, for the time, to 
take the irrevocable step of becoming a sub- 
deacon. He continues : 

" I do not remember ever having set forth the reasons 
which have made me cease to incline towards the eccle- 
siastical career. . . . Well, here it is in a nutshell. I do 
not believe enough. While the Catholic faith was the 
incarnation of all truth to me, its priesthood was in- 
vested in my eyes with a brilliant fascination, compact 
of dignity and beauty. . . . But all this time my brain 
was working desperately. Once roused, my reason de- 
manded its legitimate rights, which every time and every 
school have granted. Then I fell to verifying Christian 
truth on rational grounds. God, who sees the secrets 
of my heart, knows whether I did it faithfully and can- 
didly. Who, indeed, would dare to pass light and tri- 
fling judgments on doctrines before which eighteen cen- 
turies have knelt ? If I had any weakness to contend 
with, it was that I was favorably rather than hostilely 
inclined towards them. . . . But all had to give way 
when once I saw the truth. God forbid I should say 
Christianity is false; that word would prove my intel- 
ligence very limited. Untruth could never bear so fair 



a fruit. But it is one thing to say it is not false, and 
quite another to assert its absolute truth, at least as 
those who profess to be its interpreters understand it. I 
shall always love it and admire it. ... But when from 
this pure Christianity (which really is reason personified) 
we come down to the narrow shabby ideas, to all the 
mythical stories, that fall to pieces at the touch of can- 
did criticism. . . ." 

In 1860 M. Renan accepted a scientific mis- 
sion to Syria, and his sister accompanied him 
thither. The journey was a source of keen en- 
joyment to her ; and the year, in fact, spent in 
the garden of the Orient where the perfumed 
atmosphere seems to thrill every living thing 
with its own buoyancy, spent, above all, in the 
hourly companionship of the brother who was 
as her other self, and from whom long years of 
exile had parted her, was " the only one in her 
life which brought her no actual sorrow, and it 
was almost the only real reward she ever knew." 
But it was as the sunset glow before the dark ; 
for the night soon fell, and " the harvest-hour, 
wherein men sit them down to rest and look 
back over the weariness and suffering of by- 
gone days, never struck for her." The stay 
in Syria was incautiously prolonged over the 
season dangerous to Europeans, and brother 
and sister were stricken with the deadly fever 
that haunts the coast. For one the end was 
come. Henriette Renan died at Amschit, in 
the great room of a little native house where 
her brother lay the while unconscious, his life 
trembling in the balance. A grain of dust 
would have turned the scale against him. He 
woke from the long delirium only to learn of his 
loss that she who had dried his childish tears 
in distant Brittany ; who had smoothed his 
path from youth to manhood ; who had freely 
sacrificed her youth, her ease, her beauty, that 
he might live and thrive, was gone. To his re- 
peated questions they long replied, " She is 
very ill "; at last they told him, * She is dead." 
Then his delirium came again, and with it 
kindly oblivion. 

" I thought I was with her, as in a burning vision, at 
Aphaca, where the river Adonis rises under the huge 
walnut trees which hang above the waterfall. She was 
sitting by my side on the cool sward, I held a glass of 
icy water to her failing lips, and together we plunged 
into the life-giving spring, weeping, and borne down 
with over-mastering sadness. It was not till two days 
later that I recovered full consciousness, and that my 
disaster broke upon me in all its fearful reality." 

Henriette Renan rests in the little Syrian 
village where she died, near a pretty chapel 
shaded by palm-trees. Says her brother : 

" I shrink from the idea of taking her from the beau- 
tiful mountains where she had been so happy. . . . 
Some day, of course, she must come back to me, but who 



232

can tell what corner of the world shall hold my grave ? 
Let her wait for me then under the palms at Amschit, 
in the land of antique mysteries, by sacred By bios! " 

M. Renan eloquently concludes that God will 
not permit His saints to see corruption. 

" Oh, heart that ever nursed a flame of tenderest love! 
Oh, brain, the seat of thought so exquisitely pure! Oh, 
lovely eyes, shining with tender light! Oh, long and 
dainty hand, so often clasped in mine ! the thought 
that you are fallen away to dust thrills me with horror! 
. . . But sublunary things are all but types and shad- 
ows. . . . Personally I have never doubted the reality 
of the Moral Law. But now I see clearly that all the 
logic of the universal system must come to naught if 
such lives as hers were nothing but a delusion and a 
snare." 

Are, then, sainted lives like Henriette Re- 
nan's indeed so rare? Perhaps the earthly 
visits of such ministering angels are not so few 
and far between as we fancy ; for, alas, they 
usually remain unsung. E. G. J. 



A MODERN STATESMAN AND AN OLD 
DIVINE.* 



What multiplication of tasks can exhaust Mr. 
Gladstone's superabundant leisure ? At his age, 
after his labors he might be expected to fold 
his hands and be thankful. Yet pile what you 
will on his shoulders, this aged Titan confesses 
no weariness, cheerily stoops to Pelion, makes 
no objection to Ossa, and holds out his hands 
for new burdens, dancing lightly and gaily 
under them all. It is an athlete's triumph. 
Only a curmudgeon would question if such end- 
less tasks can all be well done, if the " old par- 
liamentary hand " may not busy itself beyond 
its power, if the whilome Prime Minister may 
not stuff his portfolio fuller than it can bear, 
if he may not go too far in making all knowl- 
edge his province, and run risk of incurring 
the modified epigram, Finance was his forte 
and omniscience his foible. But what a gallant 
spectacle it is of a brave fight against decrepi- 
tude, of one who has well earned rest, finding 
it in serious persistent labor. 

Mr. Gladstone's present work is very obvi- 
ously useful. It is never too late for a better 
edition of a classic. There can be no doubt that 
this is the best extant edition of Bishop Butler's 
works. The task of breaking up into sections 
for convenient reference and of supplying head- 
ings and indexes may be a modest one, but it 
is so serviceable for serious students that it is

Lord Bishop of Durham. Edited by the Right Hon. W. E. 
Gladstone. In two volumes. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



hard to understand that it should have been left 
for anyone to undertake one hundred and fifty 
years after Butler's death. The notes are per- 
haps none of them especially illuminative, Mr. 
Gladstone's is not a profoundly philosophic 
mind ; but they are brief and unobtrusive, and 
point to the sources of Butler's thought, or to 
the unnamed writers whom Butler refuted. The 
editor is not anxious to parade himself but to 
elucidate a favorite author. The preface is in 
admirable taste, simply setting forth what the 
editor has sought to accomplish. Students of 
Butler may well be grateful. When may we 
Americans hope for an edition of Berkeley or 
Pascal or Jonathan Edwards from some ex- 
President of the United States or ex-Speaker 
of the Lower House? 

This is hardly the arena, nor is the present 
reviewer the person, for any strictly theolog- 
ical discussion. But a classic in theology, like 
a classic in any other department, has its place 
in literary history. And whatever the precise 
merits of Bishop Butler's arguments, his posi- 
tion as a theological classic is secure. Men 
of all schools pay him willing or reluctant tri- 
bute. They like to quote him and claim his 
authority. Platonists like Martineau feel called 
upon to deal with the Aristotelian mind of But- 
ler. Roman divines like Newman do not hes- 
itate to point to the reading of Butler as a turn- 
ing point in their history. Men like Mark 
Pattison and John Hunt and Leslie Stephen 
yield him a foremost place among the thinkers 
of his age. Wits like Walter Bagehot, wits 
and poets like Matthew Arnold, cannot feel 
that the path is quite clear for the presentation 
of the most modern thinking until they have 
made a joust at this doughty champion and 
struck one ringing blow upon his shield. That 
must be solid work which affords shelter and 
tempts attack, which suggests fresh buttress- 
ing or bold battering to such various minds, 
after a century and a half since its original con- 
struction. 

The facts of Bishop Butler's life may be 
briefly enumerated. It was in 1692, the year 
of the battles of La Hogue and of Steenkirk 
and of the massacre of Glencoe, that Joseph 
Butler, the son of a dissenting shopkeeper at 
Wantage in Berkshire, came to his birth. 
William III. was on the throne. There was as 
yet no National Debt, which began in 1693, 
and no Bank of England, which was founded 
one year later. Newton's " Principia " had 
been but a few years before the world. John 
Bunyan had lately died. John Locke had just 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



233 



issued the third Letter on Toleration. Gay, 
Pope, and Richardson were in the nursery. La 
Fontaine was still living and Voltaire was not 
yet born when Butler entered on the world. It 
was rather a dismal world for a thoughtful and 
melancholy mind to enter. It was a period 
of perfunctory service in the Church and of 
corruption in the State. Public affairs were 
unsettled, the succession to the English throne 
hardly secured. The lax morals of the restora- 
tion period had infected all society, and effaced 
the strong impress which Puritanism had left 
upon the national conscience. 

The melancholy of Butler's mind may well 
have been intensified by the narrow lot and 
perverse age in which he found himself. From 
an early period he evinced rare gifts. Before 
leaving school at Gloucester, he entered into 
correspondence with the leading theologian of 
his time, acutely criticising his proof of the ex- 
istence of God. Already he had seen his course 
before him and designed "the search after 
truth to be the business of his life." In such 
a quest the broad roominess of the English es- 
tablishment attracted him, and after prepara- 
tion in a Presbyterian school, where the future 
Archbishop Seeker was his companion, he over- 
came his father's scruples, and in 1714-15 en- 
tered Oriel College, Oxford. The University 
had not altogether emerged from mediaeval 
influences, and Butler complained of the " friv- 
olous lectures and unintelligible disputations " 
which he encountered there, and had thoughts 
of migrating to Cambridge where he might 
fancy tradition would be less oppressive. Grad- 
uated, and ordained both Deacon and Priest in 
1718, he was soon appointed preacher at the 
Rolls. There he remained seven years, part of 
the time being also Rector of Houghton. He 
was seven years more in the rich living of Stan- 
hope, then Chaplain to Lord Chancellor Tal- 
bot, and in 1736 Clerk of the Closet to Queen 
Caroline. In that year he published the Anal- 
ogy. The Queen, a woman of vigorous mind 
and lively intellectual curiosity, was especially 
interested in theological speculation. Horace 
Walpole says, " Her understanding was uncom- 
mon strong. She wished to be a patroness of 
learned men, and her chief study was divinity." 

At her death she commended Butler to 
George the Second, who made him Clerk of the 
King's Closet, then Bishop of Bristol, and also 
Dean of St. Paul's, and finally in 1750 raised 
him to the richest of the English sees, that of 
Durham. It was a little earlier that the prim- 
acy of Canterbury was offered him, which he de- 



clined on the ground that it was too late for him 
to try to prop a falling Church. At Durham 
Butler delivered a charge to his clergy, which 
urged upon them decent reverence for the out- 
ward forms of religion, and the preservation of 
the sacred fabrics in which religion is enshrined. 
As he had ventured also to erect a marble cross 
in his chancel, it seemed good to the narrow 
protestantism of his time to suspect him of 
Romish tendencies, and even to set on foot a 
rumor, absolutely without foundation, that he 
had died in the Roman Communion. His some- 
what melancholy mood, his somewhat ascetic 
habit, his readings in the lives of the Saints, 
were confirmatory evidence. It was easy to 
slander a court favorite, after he was gone. He 
died in June, 1752. He was unmarried, and 
Bagehot humorously declares that the only wo- 
man he is known to have spoken to was Queen 
Caroline. 

Few persons so high in station, so remark- 
able in endowments, are so little known. The 
correspondence with Dr. Clarke, the Sermons, 
the Analogy, the Charge, the successive ecclesi- 
astical promotions, these are his history. Pre- 
ferments tumbled upon him without his effort 
or concern. He had a certain sense of his 
worth, and rather indicated in his acceptance 
of the see of Bristol, that it was not altogether 
equal to his deserts. It is hard to picture him 
at the Queen's suppers or about the King's 
Court. His native melancholy was mildly tem- 
pered by a love of building and of stained glass. 
His house at Hampstead was gay and even ele- 
gant. He spent more than he could well afford 
on his first rectory, and on his palace at Durham 
laid out the greater part of his income. He was 
a generous and cheerful giver. 

The peculiar madness of Butler's time was 
a widespread conviction that the Christian 
Church was a decrepit survival and the Chris- 
tian religion a confessed fraud or delusion. 
The age was corrupt and unimaginative. It 
had nothing but eyes to see with. Its very 
poetry was witty and sparkling prose. Its 
morals were pure utilitarianism. Its bald mo- 
tive was self-interest. It was an age of hard 
drinking and hard swearing and hard living. 
So far as it believed in religion at all, it was in 
a religion denuded of its mysteries, its awful 
sanctions, its redemptive forces. It was what 
was called natural religion by philosophers. It 
was called " the religion of men of sense " by 
men about town. It admitted God as con- 
structor of the universe and remote manager 
of events. Even Voltaire felt the need of in-

venting a God if none existed, and took credit 
to himself for erecting a temple in his honor. 
But it was a God deprived of his highest attri- 
butes, a good-natured divinity, who meddled 
little with decent people's business and could 
keep on terms with Madame du Chatelet, a 
God who had once set the machine in motion 
and was disposed not to concern himself very 
closely as to how it ran, a faineant sovereign, 
who would think twice before damning people 
of distinction, a Judge whose Hell burnt low 
and whose Heaven was a realm of snug and 
comfortable self-indulgence, where the respect- 
able classes were admitted pretty much at their 
pleasure. Religion was not really extinct, the 
mass of mankind had some sense of Christian 
living, but what we have depicted seemed a 
sufficient religion for the gentlemen of the pe- 
riod even though these gentlemen were in 
orders. There was perhaps no time in English 
history when the clergy were held in so deserv- 
edly low esteem. If they were good they were 
ignorant of the world and slightly absurd, like 
Parson Adams ; if they were bad they were 
coarse and brutal, like Parson Trulliber. They 
might be keen politicians and more or less or- 
thodox divines, like Swift or Atterbury. They 
might be triflers and would-be men of pleasure, 
like Laurence Sterne. They might be bullies 
armed with polemic cudgels, like Bishop War- 
burton. But they were hardly expected to be 
spiritual and earnest, or valiant for the faith 
to which they owed their revenues. Zeal was 
out of place ; high enthusiasm, as in Wesley, 
fell under suspicion. 

Into that grotesque world Butler found him- 
self launched with a very unusual outfit, a solid 
intellect, a sensitive conscience, sufficient learn- 
ing, and an ineradicable tendency to see things 
as they were. One great fact stared him in the 
face. How it might be in the rural districts, 
among the humbler folk, he did not perhaps 
stop to consider. His vision was penetrating, 
but its range was not wide. But in the upper 
class, among the courtiers and the men of the 
universities, the wits, the poets, the country 
squires, religion, as Butler understood it, the 
religion of Christ as disciples in all ages have 
believed it, was ceasing to exist. Its moribund 
condition was less asserted than assumed, less 
argued about than taken for granted. To be 
sure, Swift in his cynical fashion could give 
certain reasons why it might not be best imme- 
diately to abolish it. But that it only existed 
by sufferance, for lack of strength gallantly to 
die, that it was " now at length discovered to 



be fictitious," was " an agreed point among peo- 
ple of discernment." Even Butler's grave pen 
grows unconsciously humorous as he undertakes 
to prove simply " that it is not so clear a case 
that there is nothing in it." Did ever theolo- 
gian set before him a more modest endeavor ? 
It is almost impossible not to see a twinkle in 
his eye as he adds that " the practical conse- 
quence to be drawn from this is not attended 
to by everyone who is concerned in it," the 
purchasable politicians, the loose-living states- 
men, the worldly divines, the ribald rhymsters, 
or the hollow pleasure-loving women of society. 
Yet there was no twinkle in the eye or pucker 
about the lips at a dry pleasantry. Butler was 
dead in earnest, and the humor, however grim, 
was in the situation, not in the writer. The 
simplest statement was the deadliest satire. 

Butler is no enthusiast. When he confronted 
enthusiasm in the person of John Wesley he 
found it " a horid thing," and inhibited that 
great reviver of moribund religion from offi- 
ciating in his diocese. He is a man of cold 
sluggish intelligence, distrustful of the emo- 
tions, cautious to a fault, to whom the only 
access is along the avenue of reason, not the 
intuitive reason of Coleridge, but the faculty 
that deduces exact conclusions from admitted 
premises, the strict logical and dialectical fac- 
ulty which employs observation, selection, judg- 
ment, and invention, but keeps under foot 
fancy, imagination, and feeling. " Things are 
as they are, and the consequences of them will 
be what they will be. Why then should we 
desire to be deceived ? " Butler never desired 
to be deceived, however gloomy and awful re- 
ality might be. There was little play to his 
mind or healthy diversity to its activity. If he 
ever read anything but ethics and theology and 
the lives of the saints, if he ever indulged a 
flight of fancy or an iridescent dream, if he ever 
employed the penetrative or discursive imagin- 
ation, if he ever gave loose to one ill-regulated 
emotion, or stepped a hair's breadth beyond 
" the diocese of the strict conscience," we have 
no record of any such excursion or divagation. 
If he ever wrote anything but letters and ser- 
mons, a charge and the Analogy, it was de- 
stroyed by his express order at his death. He 
rarely quotes, is rarely quotable. He scarcely 
ventures upon a figure. He is quite devoid of 
grace of style. He is never eloquent nor fer- 
vid. He rarely kindles your thought or fires 
your feeling. But he strikes straight at your 
conscience and goes home to your reason. Step 
by step he advances his argument, accumulates

his evidence, laboriously removes obstacle after 
obstacle from his pathway, takes nothing for 
granted, is scrupulously candid, claims nothing 
that you hesitate to concede to him, puts his 
weight on no stepping-stone until he has tried 
if it will bear him, and so carries you, reluct- 
antly, protestingly, but inevitably, on with him, 
until he can plant you at last on what you and 
he together have satisfied yourselves is solid 
ground, to be occupied and held against all 
comers. Yet as you stand there and feel the 
sureness of your footing, you are disposed to 
resent the narrowness and aridness of the 
prospect. You are ready to confess and main- 
tain " that it is not so clear a case about Chris- 
tianity that there is nothing in it," and that 
seems a meagre contention. But if you draw 
the conclusion he desires you to draw, that " it 
is not attended to by everyone concerned in it," 
you will thank your serviceable guide who in his 
slow reticent fashion has brought you so far, 
and, if you are wise, will proceed to look for your- 
self into this no longer discredited religion. 

We are speaking of the Analogy, for, valua- 
ble as the Sermons are, the Analogy is Butler's 
great monument. It is not to be judged as an 
abstract structure displaying ideal truth. It is 
an argument to the time and the men of the 
time. Its method is probable reasoning from 
analogy. Its assumption is that on which the 
skeptical thinkers of his time were agreed, the 
existence of an intelligent Author and Ruler of 
the outer world. Its audience is " the gener- 
ality of those who profess themselves dissatis- 
fied with the evidences of religion," the aver- 
age man or woman of the world who will 
consent to follow a close argument couched in 
everyday language. It does not establish a 
demonstration, but only a presumption, that 
Christianity may be true. Its work is exposure 
of over-confident error. It deals not with the 
refined difficulties conceivable in a philosopher's 
library, but with the objections encountered on 
the street, in the loose talk at the Queen's little 
suppers, where great questions were always 
coming up and were apt to be insufficiently dealt 
with, and wrong conclusions suffered to pass 
by default. It is the well-pondered answer .to 
wild conjectures and witty sneers and half- 
earnest questions that Butler had been often 
compelled to let go unnoticed, to the grief of 
his insistent conscience troubled by the idle 
strife of tongues. It is heavy artillery brought 
in play to disperse a hovering cloud of horse- 
men. Its aim is wholly practical, to meet the 
immediate peril of religion, as a bond between 



men and God, being set aside without sufficient 
consideration ; as Bishop Halifax well said, 
" not to vindicate the character of God but to 
show the obligations of man." What Wesley 
did by an appeal to the heart, Butler does by 
an appeal to the sober judgment and common 
conscience. His concern, like that of Wesley, 
is that religion may not perish from the earth. 
Butler is a classic in his kind. The Analogy 
is a masterpiece of reasoning, and will continue 
to train generation after generation of careful 
and just thinkers. The problems and methods 
of Aristotle are not precisely ours, but the 
Ethics and the Politics will not become obso- 
lete for some time to come. The " circuitous 
and apparently awkward " style of Butler will 
continue to attract minds of a certain calibre. 
They will own that it is pedestrian always, with 
no flights of the eagle, not even impetuous trot- 
tings of the black pony, that it is sober toe-and- 
heel progression, one foot safely planted before 
the other is lifted to go on, but that it is pithy, 
condensed, idiomatic, and, to all patient stu- 
dents, clear. They will find themselves braced 
and disciplined by the perusal of works, " so 
close in tissue, so profoundly charged with vital 
matter." They will cordially recognize that a 
recluse of the eighteenth century has still a 
mission for thoughtful men perhaps of the 
twentieth century also. They will imitate his 
method even if they have outgrown his conclu- 
sions. They will seek to be as candid, as pa- 
tient, as unconcerned as he to all personal con- 
troversy. They will hope to care as little for 
mere polemical victories. For nothing " hurt " 
Butler " but an abstract idea," and he returns 
its impersonal blows with only a sound ethical 
conviction. He made the search for truth, not 
for triumph, the business of his life.

THE VOICE AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION.* 

Every book written by Professor Hiram Cor- 
son is sure to meet with a hearty reception from 
those who are interested in English literature. 
He is undoubtedly one of the leading critics 
now living ; his works on Browning and Shake- 
speare have made him known in all parts of 
England and America. Of late years he seems 
to have turned his special attention to the dis- 
cussion of general phases of educational work.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



edition, struck the keynote of the movement 
that tends to the more sympathetic study of 
the masterpieces of English literature in our 
colleges. The little volume just published, en- 
titled " The Voice and Spiritual Education," 
is an expansion of some of the ideas suggested 
in the previous book. With all the power that 
comes from a life-long study of the best litera- 
ture and a long experience of teaching, Profes- 
sor Corson speaks to the educators of this 
country in no uncertain tones. He has a face- 
tiousness of expression that reminds one of 
Lowell ; and in this book there are many bril- 
liant statements that might be quoted, but which 
must be omitted in this brief review. 

Spiritual education is necessary for the high- 
est vocal culture. Without this ability to re- 
spond to and assimilate the informing life of 
any product of literary genius, mere vocal train- 
ing avails little or nothing. This education is 
the very opposite of what generally passes for 
education : " He would be the ideal teacher 
who could induce a maximum amount of edu- 
cation on the basis of a minimum amount of 
requirement." Knowledge may be developed 
at the expense of the interior divinity. Spir- 
itual education must be begun early. " The 
child must fed before it can know" The child 
must be considered as an impressionable being, 
and home-life must minister to his spiritual 
nature. Some very suggestive remarks are 
made on the reading of children. " Upon the 
closed bud of reason, while it is not yet ready to 
be unfolded, must be brought to bear the genial 
warmth of sensibility, sympathy, and enthusi- 
asm." In the colleges and universities there 
must be the same appeal to man's higher life ; 
all acquisition of knowledge must be made sub- 
ordinate to the one great aim of quickening 
life. " To fit the soul to be spoken to by the 
eternal word, is the true, the ultimate object 
of spiritual education." 

With this spiritual training received in the 
home and college, with the power to see the 
hidden meanings of the author, the man or 
woman is prepared to undertake vocal culture. 
The author is very severe in his denunciation 
of modern "elocutionary spouting" "The 
voice instead of being the organ of the soul is 
the betrayer of soullessness." He gives several 
amusing incidents of extreme elocution of the 
present day. There is nothing in the average 
elocutionist that is " clamorous for expression, 
not even a very still small voice urging him to 
express something." The true vocal training 
can only be begun by one who is " impelled to 



cultivate vocal power because of his desire to 
express what he has sympathetically and lov- 
ingly assimilated, of a work of genius." With 
this purpose in view, " it is possible for the 
heaviest, clumsiest voice to be trained to the 
light touch." The student of vocal culture must 
by long years of study and practice get the mas- 
tery of articulation, wide range of pitch, all 
degrees of force, every variety of inflection, 
accelerated and retarded utterance, many qual- 
ities of voice, etc. The author gives an inter- 
esting practical exercise in the " light touch " 
by marking a long passage from the Book of 
Daniel. 

The writer of this review heard Professor 
Corson say that twenty years of diligent prac- 
tice were required to give him the control over 
his voice that he now has. No one who has 
heard him read the plays of Shakespeare can 
fail to see how much there is in his contention 
for the highest kind of vocal culture. To hear 
him read is to remove all doubts as to his 
thorough knowledge of the subject which he 
treats in this book. The book will doubtless 
be widely read, and will have a wide influence 
in calling attention to the evils of so-called elo- 
cution and the need for a more rational culture 
of the human voice. " The sweetest music is 
not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when 
it speaks from its instant life tones of tender- 
ness, truth, or courage." EDWIN MIMS. 



THE PIONEER OF 
AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE.* 

The pioneer, whatsoever may be the value he 
places upon his own work, is usually destined 
to have a just estimate of his services made 
only by those who in after years enjoy their 
benefit. Contemporaries may admire and ap- 
preciate his boldness, his energy, his activity, 
may even pronounce him brilliant ; but a 
correct view of his work in the perspective of 
history can only be acquired when time has 
created that perspective. The pioneer James 
Wilson, whose works have just been republished 
after the lapse of ninety years, may now be as- 
signed his true position among the architects 
of our constitutional system. And did not his 
contemporaries appreciate his ability ? Most 
truly : he was honored as a learned jurist ; his

friends awarded him hearty praise ; and the 
abuse of envious enemies enlisted the warmer 
attachment of his friends. But not in his gen- 
eration could a just discrimination assign to 
his labors, or to those of his co-laborers, their 
relative or comparative value or importance. 
Who could then have foreseen, for instance, the 
subsequent decision in the Dartmouth College 
case, to be followed by a long train of adjudi- 
cations establishing corporate rights under char- 
ters ? Who could then have anticipated the 
desirability of ascertaining and locating the 
earliest assertion of the constitutional principle 
that a legislative contract is protected against 
legislative encroachment? Who could have 
foreseen the judicial career of a Marshall, or 
have believed possible a civil war between the 
adherents of Webster's constitutional views and 
the partisans of Calhounism ? The great crea- 
tive work of Wilson as a constitutional jurist 
could scarcely have been assigned its true posi- 
tion in our juridical edifice at any time prior to 
the late war ; now, it may be. 

James Wilson was a pioneer in more senses 
than one, and he planted the advanced posts of 
our modern jurisprudence in more than one 
field. His published works consist chiefly of 
his lectures on general American Jurispru- 
dence, delivered in the Law School of Phila- 
delphia in 1790-92. These lectures are a body 
of general commentaries on the whole field of 
law ; anticipating Kent's work as an American 
commentator, though not so minute or detailed 
as Kent's. He was a philosophical jurist, given 
to a priori investigation, tracing principles to 
their sources, and testing them by the touch- 
stone of truth ; in this respect he anticipated 
not only Austin, but Bentham also, with whom 
he was contemporaneously engaged in criticis- 
ing Blackstone's praises of the English Consti- 
tution. The acknowledged ability of Mr. Jus- 
tice Wilson ensured him, as a lecturer, a large 
audience, among whom was the first President. 
His well-known views as to the essentially na- 
tional character of the Federal government, 
then a doubtful experiment in the minds of most 
Americans, were enforced in these lectures with 
a convincing logic that may well reassure the 
wavering now as it did then. Among our con- 
stitutional historians, Curtis assigns him a place 
" as one of the first jurists in America "; and 
Landon says, " he surpassed all others in his 
exact knowledge of the civil and common law, 
and the law of nations." Such was no doubt 
the estimate made of him by the first President, 
who appointed him one of the Justices of the 



Supreme Court at its organization ; for Wash- 
ington had long before sent to him his nephew, 
Bushrod Washington, as a law student, ignor- 
ing in so doing the eminent lawyers of Virginia. 
When Wilson's untimely death checked pre- 
maturely the career of a great constitutional 
jurist, it was his former student, Bushrod Wash- 
ington, who was appointed to succeed him, by 
the second President, who thereby evinced his 
own appreciation of the preceptor as a jurist. 
More than any other of the Revolutionary 
leaders, Wilson seems now to have been the 
pioneer constitutional jurist, the first to clearly 
apprehend and to distinctly state many of the 
fundamental principles of the new political sys- 
tem. As early as 1774, he declared that " all 
men are by nature equal and free," in a pub- 
lished pamphlet on " The Legislative Authority 
of the British Parliament," in which he demon- 
strated in a masterly way the want of such au- 
thority to legislate for the American Colonies, 
fortifying his position by both historical and 
judicial precedents, and outlining the whole 
constitutional claim of the colonists to exemp- 
tion from Parliamentary taxation, and to recog- 
nition as fellow-subjects with the English, in 
allegiance to the same prince, and entitled to 
the same rights under the British Constitution. 
In a speech delivered in January, 1775, he 
enunciated the doctrine of the Declaration of 
Independence, that the King had violated the 
British Constitution by conniving at the usurpa- 
tions of Parliament, and proposed for adoption 
by the Pennsylvania Convention a resolution 
declaring that the act altering the Massachu- 
setts charter, the Boston port bill, and the act 
quartering soldiers upon the colonies, " are 
unconstitutional and void, and can confer no 
authority upon those who act under color of 
them ; that all force employed to carry such 
unjust and illegal attempts into execution is 
force without authority ; that it is the right of 
British subjects to resist such force ; and that 
this right is founded upon both the letter and 
the spirit of the British Constitution." The 
doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, as 
the true source of all political power, was early 
adopted by him, was embodied with his assent 
in the Federal and State Constitutions, was 
enunciated in his argument in the Pennsylvania 
Convention in favor of the adoption of the Fed- 
eral Constitution, and was illustrated frequently 
in his lectures before the Law School, with a 
lucidity and fervor not surpassed in the opinion 
he rendered as a Justice of the Supreme Court 
in the case of Chisholm vs. Georgia. He was 



238 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



an earnest advocate of the dual system of gov- 
ernment, Federal and State, which was intro- 
duced by the Constitution of 1787, and his 
expositions of its advantages were peculiarly 
distasteful to its opponents. 

The "obligation clause" of the United States 
Constitution has been a bone of contention 
among jurists and students of the law. Learned 
lawyers have pertinaciously insisted that the 
f ramers of the Constitution never intended it to 
apply to grants by the legislature of charters of 
incorporation. Critics have denounced the 
Supreme Court of 1819 for having invented 
the idea, in the Dartmouth College case, that a 
corporate charter was a legislative contract, 
which must be held inviolable just as a different 
legislative grant had been held in Fletcher vs. 
Peck. It is now known that at the very time 
when the legislature of Georgia repealed its 
grant of 1795, Hamilton stated his conviction 
that such legislation was a violation of the 
" obligation clause," and predicted the decision 
in Fletcher vs. Peck, which was rendered after 
his death. It is now known, too, that Wilson, 
to whom is generally ascribed the introduction 
into the Constitution of the phrase " obligation 
of contracts," had, prior to such use of that 
phrase, announced positive and uncompromis- 
ing views on the subject of repeal of corporate 
charters. In a pamphlet published in 1785, he 
considered the proposition that the legislature 
of Pennsylvania should repeal the charter 
granted by it in 1782 to the Bank of North 
America. Upon the broadest constitutional 
grounds, viewing the state legislature as un- 
hampered by any express restrictions upon its 
powers, he argued against the possession of any 
power by the legislature to repeal an act creat- 
ing a private corporation after its acceptance 
by the incorporators. Such a charter he de- 
clared to be "a compact, to be interpreted 
according to the rules and maxims by which 
compacts are governed." This, the earliest 
known argument on the subject, shows the views 
of the man who introduced the phrase " obliga- 
tion of contracts " into our jurisprudence. The 
criticism is often made that while the decision 
in Fletcher vs. Peck, as to a legislative grant 
of land, may have been sound, this by no means 
warranted the extension of the principle to 
grants of charters, as in the Dartmouth Col- 
lege case. But Wilson's argument, made two 
years before the Constitution was framed, antic- 
ipates both the ruling in Fletcher vs. Peck and 
that in the Dartmouth College case, as a prop- 
osition inherent in constitutional jurisprudence. 



It seems impossible to doubt that this argu- 
ment was influential in shaping not only the 
views advanced by Webster, the advocate, but 
those adopted by Marshall and the other judges, 
in the great case in which that proposition be- 
came embodied in our system. The editor of 
this new edition of Wilson's works has appro- 
priately emphasized this argument, now repro- 
duced, as not the least valuable of his contribu- 
tions to our constitutional precedents. 

If his only achievement had been his opinion 
in the case of Chisholm vs. Georgia, Wilson 
would have thereby won distinction. During 
his term of nine years' service as a Justice of 
the Supreme Court, very few constitutional 
cases were litigated. This one is the only ex- 
tended opinion pronounced by Wilson as a 
judge ; but it is " a lion." The great and fun- 
damental question arose as to the relative rank 
and place of the States and the Central Gov- 
ernment, in the American constitutional sys- 
tem. The court, with but one dissent, decided 
that the Constitution subordinated the states- 
to the nation, and subjected a state to the 
suit of a private individual. On the founda- 
tion of this decision rests the governmental 
fabric of the United States ; for a contrary 
conclusion would have made the Union but a 
rope of sand. Two of the judges, Jay and 
Wilson, were by previous training and study 
prepared to state their conclusions in opinions 
replete with juridical learning, and the opinions 
of both are constitutional landmarks. It is no 
reflection upon the great character and attain- 
ments of Chief Justice Jay to say that his opin- 
ion is, in respect of scholarly diction and lucid- 
ity of reasoning, surpassed by that of his 
colleague Wilson. The latter set to himself, 
in this decision, the task of answering the ques- 
tion, " Do the people of the United States form 
a Nation ? " This question is illustrated by 
copious classical, historical, and juridical ref- 
erences, presented with the vivacity of an earn- 
est debater, the answer constituting a thesis in 
which the broad observations of a scholar, the 
close analysis of a jurist, and the profound re- 
searches of a philosopher are happily united. 
The freshness of his diction relieves the arid- 
ity of a dry subject, without detracting from 
its juristic value. His distinctions between 
statehood and sovereignty, his terse assertions 
of the sovereignty of the people, his illustra- 
tions of the inherent characteristics and the 
high honor of that sovereignty, and his close 
analysis of all the governmental questions in- 
volved in the American system, might to-day

be well taken as a text-book by the student of 
our institutions. He found the people of the 
United States asserting by implication, in the 
Federal Constitution, their sovereignty, and 
the implication sufficed him. " In an instru- 
ment well drawn, as in a poem well composed, 
silence is sometimes most expressive. To the 
Constitution of the United States, the term sov- 
ereign is totally unknown. There is but one 
place where it could have been used with propri- 
ety. But even in that place it would not, per- 
haps, have comported with the delicacy of those 
who ordained and established that Constitution. 
They might have announced themselves ' sov- 
ereign ' people of the United States ; but, se- 
renely conscious of the fact, they avoided the 
ostentatious declaration." 

In his lectures on jurisprudence, Wilson was 
not only original, but far in advance of his 
time ; for such a course of lectures, if now first 
presented, would attract wide attention, and be 
worthy the authorship of any jurist of the day. 
They are merely general in their character, 
traversing with broad sweep the field of juris- 
prudence. Their merit lies in their exposition 
of first and fundamental principles and in the 
lecturer's fine analysis. Government, consti- 
tutions, laws, legislation, and the administra- 
tion of justice, are collated and connoted as 
parts of one system. Sovereignty is analysed 
and traced to its source in the individual man. 
In the mental characteristics and capacities of 
man are found the basic principles of not only 
the true conceptions of sovereignty and gov- 
ernment on the one hand, but of the rules of 
judicial evidence on the other. A full modern 
treatise on evidence might be based upon Wil- 
son's admirable chapter on the subject, in 
which, on a priori principles, the lecturer dis- 
closes fourteen distinct sources of that informa- 
tion which the mind recognizes as evidence. 
Understanding of this classification is aided by 
the lecturer's previous illustrations of thought, 
conception, belief, and judgment as operations 
of the mind ; and those illustrations are now 
seen to be not merely theoretical and discur- 
sive, but practical and pertinent. These lec- 
tures are not only modern in their style of treat- 
ment of the subject, an American anticipation 
of what has been called the English theory of 
jurisprudence, but they are thoroughly Amer- 
ican in spirit. The author's terse definition of 
a constitution is, " that supreme law, made or 
ratified by those in whom the sovereign power 
of the state resides, which prescribes the man- 
ner according to which the state wills that the 



government should be instituted and adminis- 
tered." His account of the history of former 
confederacies, including in the list not only 
those which became operative, but also the ideal 
confederacy of European powers which was the 
dream of Henry IV., shows the growth of the 
idea of confederacy as leading up to our pres- 
ent system of a Federal Republic, and contrasts 
its excellences with the defects of all its pre- 
decessors. He expounds with some detail the 
characteristic features of the new American 
system, and patriotically contrasts the Ameri- 
can and British Constitutions, to the disadvan- 
tage of the latter. His national feeling was so 
marked that he treated Federal and State Con- 
stitutions as together composing one system, a 
practice to which our jurists are now returning. 
It is not uncommon at the present day to 
exalt the United States system of government 
to high rank among the governmental experi- 
ments which the world has seen tried. A cen- 
tury ago, patriotic Americans hoped for the 
success of their new experiment, amid many 
forebodings and more doubts. But Wilson, 
studying it in the light of history and with the 
insight of a philosopher, acquired a faith in its 
capacity which exceeded hope ; and, at its very 
inception, he deliberately recommended it to 
his fellow- citizens of Pennsylvania, in a public 
address, as " the best form of government which 
has ever been offered to the world." This is 
not vain glorification of a fabric which Judge 
Wilson had helped to erect, for he gives abun- 
dant reasons, at every step in his arguments, for 
the faith he entertains, and demonstrates the 
correctness of his conclusions. His writings 
deserve a place, as preliminary instruction in 
the fundamentals of our government, not only 
in every law school in the land, but in every 
institution which aims to assist in the study of 
Government, Civics, or Political Economy.

POST-DARWINIAN THEORIES.* 

The second Part of the late Mr. Romanes'

discussion of post-Darwinian theories of He- 
redity and Utility. The book falls into two 
main divisions : the first half considers the evi-

ance of acquired characters ; the second dis- 
cusses the question whether or not all specific 
characters are to be regarded as adaptive. Thus 
in both is the common purpose to show that 
other causes have probably cooperated with 
Natural Selection in Evolution. 

The author's remarkable power of exposition 
renders this the clearest and simplest book that 
has appeared in the sphere of the problems it 
discusses. Its style is very refreshing in con- 
trast with much of the recent controversy on 
the question of acquired characters. It does 
not marshall the facts to illustrate a precon- 
ceived theory; but asks what really are the 
facts, and then proceeds to question whether 
they are sufficient to warrant any fixed theoretic 
conclusions. While thus displaying through- 
out the scientific temper, Mr. Romanes recog- 
nizes that the discussion of his fundamental 
problems must be carried on at present as a 
matter of general reasoning, since the facts are 
so complex, and our knowledge of them is in- 
adequate for a final conclusion. 

In his preliminary discussion of theories the 
author shows how unfair is the claim of Weis- 
mann and his school that upon their opponents 
rests the burden of proof of the inheritance of 
acquired characters, while at the same time 
Weismann refuses to recognize any evidence 
except in cases where it can be shown that nat- 
ural selection has not been present at all. He 
clears up the popular error which attributes to 
Weismann the first doubting of the Lamarck- 
ian factors in heredity ; showing that Mr. Gal- 
ton in 1875 presented a theory of " Stirps " 
which led him to doubt entirely the presence 
of these factors, and that Mr. Romanes him- 
self had still earlier been led to question them. 

In his " indirect evidence in favor of the in- 
heritance of acquired characters," he deals 
chiefly with reflex actions ; such as the reflex 
mechanism of our own organization which en- 
sures the prompt withdrawal of the legs from 
any source of irritation applied to the feet ; and 
such as the mechanism in a brainless frog which 
enables it to preserve its balance on a book that 
is slowly revolved. The peculiar significance 
of these actions results from the fact that each 
is a complex coordination of functions in which 
the separate functions have no selective value ; 
and yet the coordination could never arise as the 
mere blending of adaptations. Hence it seems 
that Natural Selection would have nothing to 
work with in such a case unless the complex 
coordination of functions sprang at once into 
full being. Some similar arguments are drawn 



from the sphere of Instinct, but much less stress 
is placed upon these since their bearing has 
been more fully recognized than in the case of 
inherited reflex actions. 

In his chapter on " experimental evidence 
in favor of the inheritance of acquired charac- 
ters," he calls attention to the meagreness of 
the work that has been done ; and dwells par- 
ticularly on the observations of Brown-Sequard 
upon guinea-pigs ; the results of which were 
in a limited degree corroborated by his own 
experiments. He concludes that here, and in 
the case of some experiments with plants, the 
facts bear very strongly against Weismann's 
hypothesis ; although they are admitted to be 
insufficient to prove the existence of Lamarck- 
ian factors. Mr. Romanes speaks with the 
authority derived from experiments carried on 
by him through a long period of years ; yet he 
frankly confesses that the results of his own 
work were chiefly negative, without being of 
such a conclusive character as to lead him to 
the point of view of Weismann. 

The author's conclusion is that while prob- 
ably there is a relative continuity of germ- 
plasm, we have every reason to doubt that this 
continuity is and always has been absolute ; 
and that Weismann's theory of its absolute con- 
tinuity was constructed to support his extended 
system of speculative theory. It is certainly an 
interesting thing that the long discussion as to 
the inheritance of acquired characters has left 
the most of us at the point of view taken by 
Mr. Romanes, feeling that acquired characters 
have much less importance in heredity than was 
formerly supposed, and yet probably do form 
an appreciable element in the whole problem of 
evolution. 

As Weismann's theories are discussed in the 
first part of the book, so the views of Wallace 
form the subject of criticism in the second part, 
although, the author observes, the individual in 
each case is selected only as the most noteworthy 
representative of the point of view opposed. 
He holds it to be a matter of fact that " a large 
proportional number, if not a majority," of 
specific characters are of the class to which no 
use can be assigned. This is illustrated by the 
results of his study of color characteristics in 
birds and mammals. Hence he concludes that 
there is every reason to believe many specific 
characters to be indifferent, and the result of 
other causes than natural selection. Among 
these causes he considers climate, food, sexual 
selection, laws of growth, and isolation. Most 
of these latter factors may be summed up in 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



241 



what Dr. Jordan has called " the survival of 
the existing." 

From a discussion of the different definitions 
of Species is shown the impossibility of secur- 
ing an absolute principle of classification. He 
suggests that the separation of specific charac- 
ters from variations on the one side and generic 
characters on the other, as being in a unique 
way the result of natural selection, is in part a 
result of the title of Darwin's book on the 
" Origin of Species." Hence the curious result 
that something like the earlier superstitious 
reverence for species which Darwin's book was 
written to overthrow has resulted from the book 
itself. 

He makes it very clear that no definite line 
can be drawn between specific characters and 
other differentiated qualities. " Bad " species 
must always multiply at the expense of " good " 
species, since it is often our ignorance of inter- 
mediate forms which determines our classifica- 
tion of two known kinds as distinct species. 
Hence the effort of Wallace to hold specific 
characters as always adaptive, while acknowl- 
edging that variations and generic and family 
forms may often be unadaptive, is reduced to 
an absurdity. This seems so entirely obvious 
that one is inclined to wonder at the space de- 
voted to it, but Mr. Romanes says in his pre- 
face : " From my previous experience of the 
hardness with which this fallacious doctrine 
dies, I do not deem it safe to allow even one 
fragment of it to remain, lest, hydra-like, it 
should re-develop into its former proportions." 

Certainly it is worth while to make entirely 
clear the fact that Evolution is a theory of the 
origin and cumulative development of adaptive 
characters, and not merely of species. On this 
basis the author proceeds to show that hence in 
the development of all adaptive characters 
Natural Selection must be at least the chief 
cause, but is by no means the only cause in 
determining species. 

The chief value of the book is as a keen criti- 
cism of unwarrantable theories. It is only 
indirectly constructive ; yet it is of great posi- 
tive value, since it clears the ground wonder- 
fully, and places us in a position to see the facts 
as they are. EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS. 



MESSRS. O. L. Elliott and O. V. Eaton are the authors 
of a prettily illustrated pamphlet descriptive of " Stan-

Francisco, and for sale by Mr. William Doxey. It gives 
a brief account of the history and present status of the 
University, and has many views of the buildings and 
surrounding scenery. 



TRAVELS VARIOUS.* 

Mr. D. G. Hogarth discourses lightly and pleas- 
antly in " A Wandering Scholar in the Levant" of 
varied experiences and impressions in the Near 
East. In his first two chapters we have an inter- 
esting account of a scholar's adventures in copying 
inscriptions, collecting coins, and buying relics of 
the classic past in the land of the wily Turk ; the 
third chapter gives general impressions of Anatolia. 
Mr. Hogarth tells us that the Turkish peasant is a 
" slow-moving, slow-thinking rustic, who limits his 
speech to three tenses out of the sixty-four in his 
language, and his interests to the price of barley." 
... In energy and intelligence he takes rank a 
grade below his dog." Mr. Hogarth makes many 
suggestive remarks on the Armenian problem and 
on the problem of the Turk and his waning power. 
He says that the Turk 

" Has lost heart himself. Already he foretells the sta- 
tions in the retreat of the Crescent-Stambul to Brusa, 
Brusa to Aleppo, Aleppo to Bagdad ; and Moslem 
mothers tell their children that this or that will come to 
pass as surely as a cross will be seen again on Santa 
Sophia. And, be sure, the Turk will make no effort 
himself to arrest his own decay; for as faith grows 
weaker, the original sin of fatalism waxes more strong 
that fatalism which has been mistaken so often for a 
symptom of Islam, but preceded it and will survive." 

Then follow chapters giving impressions of travel 
and research in the Euphrates region, in Egypt and 
in Cyprus. Mr. Hogarth's style is refined yet strong, 
and he has made an original and interesting vol- 
ume, and instructive withal, in which we learn some 
archaeology and politics, and more history and an- 
thropology. While certainly not a great book, yet 
it is a genuine book in its sketchy way. 

Miss Alice Blanche Balfour, sister of the present 
First Lord of the Treasury, gives in " Twelve Hun- 
dred Miles in a Waggon " an account of a trip made 
through Matabeleland and Mashonaland in the mid- 
dle of 1894. The journey was through country well 
known, although but sparsely settled by Europeans, 
and was" quite uneventful as she herself deplores.

without seeing either lion, crocodile, or hippopota- 
mus. What has been the use of coming to Africa ! " 
Travelling by ox wagon seems neither an adven- 
turous or rapid or comfortable mode of transit. 
Certainly two and one-half miles an hour is twenty 
times too slow for the American, and a daily start at 
three A. M., bad roads, foul water, and other such 
incidents will hardly commend this trip to the tour- 
ist, though Miss Balf our makes light of it all. How- 
ever, if Miss Balfour had the pen of a Stevenson 
she might make as interesting a book of her meagre 
experiences as he did of " Travels with a Donkey"; 
but we must frankly confess that the style is as 
commonplace as the matter, though the simplicity 
and directness of the narrative is in a measure en- 
gaging. The drawings are very creditable. 

Captain H. M. Chittenden's account of the Yel- 
lowstone Park is a book of information, a popular 
monograph and handbook, and the completest work 
of the kind yet published. It is prepared evidently 
with much care, and will be of service to tourists, and 
others interested in the subject. It has appendices 
giving the legislation on the Park, a list of appro- 
priations and of superintendents, an extended biblio- 
graphy, and a good index, but the illustrations do 
not add much to the book. As to the game in the 
Park we note the interesting remark : 

" There are no fewer than 30,000 elk in the Park. 
For the buffalo, mountain sheep, and a few other varie- 
ties, the prospect is good, though not so flattering. The 
number of buffalo does not exceed probably two hun- 
dred, and the possibility of their early extinction has 
led the Smithsonian Institute to allote a sum of money 
for the construction of a large inclosure in the Park, 
where at least a portion of the herd can be kept and be 
thus more carefully protected. Of the moose, moun- 
tain lion, wolverine, lynx, wild-cat, marten, and otter, 
the perpetuation is more doubtful." 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis has collected sketches 
of travel, most or all of which have appeared in the 
magazines, into a volume entitled " Three Gringos in 
Venezuela and Central America." A " gringo," be 
it known, is one who jabbers gibberish ; hence from 
the point of view of the scornful Spanish- American, 
all English-speaking travellers are gringos. Like 
Mr. Davis's other books, this is bright and clever 
writing, though sometimes overdrawn, and some- 
times flippant with sophomoric smartness which 
might well be exchanged for serious fun and honest 
enthusiasm. But notwithstanding a hard manner- 
ism which at times makes itself unpleasantly felt, 
the book is both sufficiently entertaining and instruc- 
tive. We feel after reading it that the best thing 
for the so-called republics of Central America would 
be to come under the sway of the best administra- 
tors in the world, the English, and that Cuba as a 
republic could be only a failure. The illustrations 
from photographs are very good and interesting. 

Another book which concerns itself with South 
America is Mr. J. R. Spear's " The Gold Diggings 
of Cape Horn." The author frankly acknowledges 
that this is only a " collection of newspaper sketches," 



and we might judge as much from internal evidence, 
for we find everywhere that eagerness to make a 
strong tale, if not o'er true, that striving for effect 
at almost any cost, which is apt to characterize 
newspaper writing. The title is a misnomer, as we 
find but some twenty pages on gold mining. Argen- 
tine Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego and its people 
are the real subject. We learn that the country in 
its mining, ranching, and agricultural resources is 
fast being developed by immigrants of various na- 
tionalities, and that the native savage tribes are 
rapidly disappearing. Mr. Spears glorifies the sav- 
agery of the Yahgan Indians and decries the mis- 
sionaries without stint. We may admit that this 
tribe is not of the lowest grade, but we should desire 
more full and scientific knowledge of their lan- 
guage of " over 40,000 words "; and as to the debas- 
ing effect of the misdirected effort of the mission- 
aries, this was from his own statements far less 
hurtful than the brutalities of seamen and miners. 
The problem of savage life in sudden and close con- 
tact with civilization is certainly not solved by Mr. 
Spear's easy laissez faire theory. The book im- 
presses us as a hasty, biased sketch, and mostly 
made from hearsay, the last chapter being almost 
the only bit of personal narrative. Still, as being 
a fairly well written description of a little-known 
country, it will interest the general reader, and be 
of service to tourists and investors. 

" With Kelly to Chitral," by Lieut. W. G. L. 
Benyon, is correctly described by the author as " an 
account of the daily life of British officers and In- 
dian troops on a frontier expedition ; how we lived 
and marched, what we ate and drank, our small 
jokes and trials, our marches through snow and rain, 
hot valleys or pleasant fields." This narrative of 
the relief of Chitral on the northwest frontier of 
India gives no striking incidents, and, told in the 
unemotional soldierly fashion, will hardly be of much 
interest to the American civilian. But whoever 
wishes to know the life of the common soldier and 
officer on an expedition among the mountains of the 
lower Himalyan region will here find it set down 
briefly in plain and blunt prose. The book is pro- 
vided with a serviceable map and some passable 
illustrations. 

Lafcadio Hearn's last book on Japan is entitled 
" Kokoro," that is, the heart, thus indicating the 
subject of the book, the emotional life of the Jap- 
anese as seen in their patriotism and religiousness, 
romantic love, and so on. Mr. Hearn insists that 
Japan is now no closer emotionally to Western life 
than she was thirty years ago (p. 11), which, how- 
ever, he practically contradicts in saying (p. 37) 
that the Japanese are even now feeling " the new 
sentiment of aggressive egotism." Mr. Hearn's 
prophecy for Japan is : 

" The foreign settlements, as communities, will dis- 
appear: there will remain only some few great agencies, 
such as exist in all the chief ports of the civilized world; 
and the abandoned streets of the concessions, aud the 
costly foreign houses on the heights, will be peopled and

tenanted by Japanese. Large foreign investments will 
not be made in the interior. And even Christian mission- 
work must be left to native missionaries; for just as 
Buddhism never took definite form in Japan until the 
teaching of its doctrines was left entirely to Japanese 
priests, so Christianity will never take any fixed shape 
till it has been so remodeled as to harmonize with the 
emotional and social life of the race. Even thus re- 
modeled it can scarcely hope to exist except in the form 
of a few small sects." 

Mr. Hearn believes that the hope of the race is " a 
Buddhism strongly fortified by Western science." 
It is everywhere obvious that our author is a pro- 
nounced Japophile, and so not capable of a thor- 
oughly critical and impartial treatment of his sub- 
ject ; yet his style is so skilful, and his appreciation 
of the Japanese character so intimate and thought- 
ful, that this slight work will be of interest and 
value to all who seek a better understanding of the 
new nation of the Far East. 

HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. Joseph Jacobs's " Jewish Ideals, 
SSS&t* and Other Essays "(Macmillan) is 

a collection of thoughtful and schol- 
arly papers, mainly reprints, ranging over many 
problems which the peculiar position of modern 
Judaism has brought into prominence. This posi- 
tion Mr. Jacobs regards and elucidates from the 
standpoint of modern thought and culture, yet with 
due fidelity to Jewish history and the higher and 
worthier Jewish ideals and aspirations. Some of 
the titles are: "The God of Israel, a history"; 
" Jehuda HaleVi, Poet and Pilgrim "; " The Lon- 
don Jewry, 1290 "; " Little St. Hugh of Lincoln "; 
" Jewish History : Its Aims and Methods "; etc. 
The so-called Jewish Question is touched upon briefly 
in a semi-humorous paper in which the writer en- 
deavors to show that the current ill-will against 
Jews is largely due to the " over-intellectuality " of 
their early education. We may infer from what 
Mr. Jacobs says on this point that the young Jew 
is virtually trained for life as for a wit-combat b, 
outrance no " gentle and joyous " passage-at-arms 
in which magnanimity, courtesy, and forbearance 
play their parts, but a keen struggle in which the 
great point is to win. Consequently we find, he 
thinks, that " the absence of charm is as distinct a 
characteristic of Jews as the presence of capacity " 
a proposition which may at least be excepted to 
as inapplicable to the fairer half of the race : the 
hardiest Anti-Semite will scarcely deny charm to 
the daughters of Judah. Following out his argu- 
ment, Mr. Jacobs hits upon what he cheerfully be- 
lieves to be a complete and feasible " solution " of 
the Jewish Question ; and this he embodies in the 
paradoxical advice to Jewish parents, " Make fools 
of your children " that is, we take it, make them 
foolish enough, or, if you will, Quixotic enough, to 



think that there are other and even better ends in 
life than material ones ; other virtues than " sharp- 
ness "; other ways of regarding one's neighbor than 
as primarily a competitor to be striven with. Mr. 
Jacobs's " solution " seems to us to be of much wider 
applicability and efficacy than he claims for it ; and 
we commend it to the notice of Gentile parents 
not excepting Anglo-American ones. 

"Napoleon III." (imported by Scrib- 

ners ) is stm a ?. ther book of P ersonal 
chat and reminiscence from the pen 

of that cheery raconteur, Sir William Fraser. Sir 
William's capital volumes, " Disraeli and his Day," 
" Hie et Ubique," etc., are known as among the best 
of their kind ; and his latest venture shows no sign 
of flagging spirits or a depleted repertory. He knew 
Napoleon personally (if, indeed, anyone can fairly 
be said to have known that inscrutable character), 
and saw a good deal of him during the main phases 
of his career down to the closing days at Chisel- 
hurst. The portrait he draws of Napoleon is a favor- 
able one, and he takes occasion more than once to 
contrast him with his uncle, not at all to the latter's 
advantage. Sir William has no doubt whatever 
that Napoleon III., after his downfall, intended to 
return to France, and to execute a coup d'6tat re- 
motely similar to his great uncle's after the return 
from Elba. The details had been arranged. A 
private yacht was engaged to land the Emperor 
secretly on the coast of France, the plan being that 
he should proceed to the camp at Chalons, where a 
large army was assembled for the Autumn man- 
oeuvres. Declaring himself, he was to head this 
force, and march at once upon Paris. These facts 
the author had from the owner of the yacht which 
had been selected, the late James Ashbury, who, 
adds the author, " more than once mentioned the 
circumstance to me ; and he repeated it the evening 
before his death." The book is full of good stories 
and pen-portraits, and these are interlarded with 
the shrewd worldly-wise comments on notable men 
and events of one who has known both at first-hand. 



The term Hedonism is frequently 
used to designate a class of moralists 
who agree in holding that all human 
action is determined by the agent's desire for his 
own pleasure, and that conduct is approved or dis- 
approved solely according to the relation in which 
it stands to the happiness of the person judging. 
This is not the only significance of the term, but 
certainly it may be used in this sense if desired. It 
is of these moralists that Professor Watson writes 
in his little work, " Hedonistic Theories from Aris- 
tippus to Herbert Spencer " (Macmillan). The de- 
scriptive portions are for the most part very well 
done. The exposition is always clear, logical, and, 
considering the limited space devoted to any one 
author, remarkably complete. The most serious 
errors are those by which Hume and Herbert Spen- 
cer are brought into the list of Hedonists as here

defined. Both of these writers affirm the reality 
of purely unselfish action in the strictest sense of 
that term. Accordingly Professor Watson should 
either have omitted them entirely in his study, or 
else have broadened his definition of Hedonism. 
But unfortunately he has his own notions of what a 
man must believe who attributes value to pleasure 
for its own sake, as do both Hume and Spencer, and 
it is therefore perhaps no matter of surprise that in 
the presence of such an a priori theory the mere 
facts of history should be handled rather rudely. 
Apart from this, the presentation of Mr. Spencer's 
ethical views is one of the best that has ever been 
written. In the critical remarks to which the expo- 
sition always leads up, the specialist who is well 
read in the subject will find little that is new. 
Throughout they display that union of exceptional 
power of insight with a mania for discovering con- 
tradictions and scoring the maximum number of 
points from the enemy, which is coming to be char- 
acteristic of the school of T. H. Green. The be- 
ginner for whom the book is evidently intended will 
probably be rather repelled than attracted by these 
tactics, while his patience will be sorely tried in at- 
tempting to follow intelligently certain portions of 
the reasoning. Professor Watson is not as uniformly 
successful in making a popular presentation of his 
own views as he is in the case of his opponents. 
But the merits of the work in this latter respect are 
so exceptional that it may be cordially recom- 
mended to all those interested in the problems of 
ethics. 

General Sir Evelyn Wood's " Cav- 
^y^ the Waterloo Campaign" 
(Roberts) forms a capital comple- 
mentary volume to the previously issued works in 
this series, " The Decline and Fall of Napoleon " 
and " The Rise of Wellington," by Viscount Wolse- 
ley and General Lord Roberts, respectively. The 
three volumes together are a desirable addition to 
the critical literature of the Waterloo campaign. 
General Wood's book has a certain advantage in 
freshness of theme, or rather of standpoint no 
author heretofore having applied himself specially 
to bringing out clearly and consecutively the cavalry 
operations during the four days' fighting. It is to 
this point, and to brief sketches of the cavalry lead- 
ers on both sides, that the writer confines himself, 
telling only enough of the general story of the bat- 
tle to render his recital intelligible. The work is 
prefaced by a chapter on the organization of the 
French army, in which General Wood shows the 
falsity of the common statement that Napoleon had 
at Waterloo " the finest army he ever commanded." 
About fifty per cent of the Line of the Emperor's 
forces were recruits, mainly young and immature 
men ; and of the Imperial Guard, 18,500 strong, 
some 5000 were untrained men, and the balance 
were largely worn veterans of previous campaigns. 
Organization was imperfect, and discipline was lack- 
ing. The " Iron Duke " seems to have owed a very 



considerable share of his renown to the capricious 
Goddess of Chance. Had Napoleon been Napoleon 
on the day of Waterloo ; and had he on that day 
commanded, instead of the somewhat Falstaffian 
array of recruits that made up half his army, the 
battalions organized by the iron genius of the great 
Carnot, it had undoubtedly gone hard with Welling- 
ton and Blilcher. General Wood scouts the notion, 
not uncommon among English infantry soldiers, 
that, now that " we possess a rifle which, when fired 
horizontally on level ground, propels a bullet through 
the air for five hundred yards without its rising 
more than five feet," the days of cavalry are prac- 
tically passed away. The lament over the fancied 
evanishment of the horse-soldier is an old one ; and 
many changes have been rung on it since Hotspur's 
"popinjay lord "bewailed the advent of " villainous 
saltpetre "; but the author notes that cavalry, so far 
from disappearing, is, since the war of 1870-71, 
even growing somewhat in favor all the great Con- 
tinental Powers increasing the number of their 
mounted troops, and training them with greater 
care. The volume contains a number of maps and

American Professor Brander Matthews has 

literature for written " An Introduction to Amer- 
young students. ican Literature" (American Book 
Co.) which is easily the best book for the use of the 
lower schools that has yet been produced upon this 
subject. It has the twofold virtue of not saying too 
much, and of putting in simple and forceful lan- 
guage the things that it does say. It offers easy 
reading for young students, yet is free from the vice 
of being obtrusively " written down " to the level of 
their intellectual appreciation. A baker's dozen of 
writers are discussed in as many chapters, the selec- 
tion being Franklin, Irving, Cooper, Bryant, Emer- 
son, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Whjttier, Poe, Holmes, 
Thoreau, Lowell, and Parkman. Another chapter 
treats of Halleck and Drake, still another of the 
Colonial period, while two closing chapters make 
brief mention of " Other Writers " and discuss " The 
End of the Nineteenth Century." The apparatus 
consists of suggestive questions and bibliographical 
notes appended to the several chapters, and a brief 
chronology. The illustrations are portraits, homes, 
and autographs. The judgments expressed are 
usually sound, and the book is remarkably free from 
those critical crochets that the best of men some- 
times put into school manuals. The note of Amer- 
icanism is often struck, but not sounded over-harshly, 
and youthful American readers are led to feel that 
the literature of their own country should be deeply 
interesting to them, without being given the impres- 
sion that a Longfellow is a Tennyson. Our only 
quarrel with the author is for sanctioning the irri- 
tating pedantry that spells Vergil for Virgil ; but 
we suspect that if Dr. W. F. Poole were living, he 
would have something to say about the statement 
that Cotton Mather " was one of the most active in 
the persecution of the alleged witches of Salem."

Miss Louise McLaughlin's " The Sec- 
EUzabeth Char- ond Madame " (Putnam) is an enter- 

lotte of Banana. . . . , , v , , ' 

taming little book, based on the cor- 
respondence of Elizabeth Charlotte of Bavaria, 
second wife of Monsieur the brother of Louis XIV., 
and mother of the Regent Orleans of unsavory 
memory. Madame's marriage was a purely polit- 
ical one. Adrift, as it were, in a strange land and 
an uncongenial society, proud, blunt of speech and 
plain of feature, a faithful wife and a devoted mother 
at a court where such bourgeois virtues were scouted, 
she solaced herself by writing long and frequent 
letters (forty to fifty pages a day was no unusual 
amount for her) to her friends in Germany. The 
extracts from these missives, culled by the author 
and woven into her narrative, present some piquant 
and lively pictures of men and manners at the court 
of the Grand Monarch. Die allmdchtige Dame, 
Mme. de Maintenon, appears (to no great advan- 
tage) in Madame's pages under epithets of varying 
degrees of depreciation, from the mildly and femi- 
ninely spiteful " old thing," down to a term most 
offensive to ears polite. There is a note of ffeim- 
weh in the letters throughout. Remaining intensely 
and thoroughly German in all things, Madame never 
ceased to despise French morals, French etiquette, 
and French cookery. She lived to a great age (cor- 
responding actively to the last), her son the Regent 
surviving her bat a year. The book is prettily and 
daintily made, the tasteful cover-design calling for 
special mention. 

A concise ^ conc ^ se an( l clear account of " The 
account of the China -Japan War" (imported by 
China-Japan war. goners ) may be found in the 
neatly appointed volume compiled from Japanese, 
Chinese, and foreign sources by " Vladimir," lately 
of the Diplomatic Mission to Corea. The author 
has " boiled down " his multifarious materials into 
an impartial, intelligible, and coherent narrative, 
to which is prefixed a preliminary chapter on the 
historical and political antecedents of the war, an 
account of the forces of the combatants, etc. The 
Appendix contains some interesting documentary 
matter, diplomatic correspondence preceding the 
war, correspondence between Admirals Ito and 
Ting, peace negotiations and text of treaty, etc.; 
and there are some good maps and diagrams. There 
are a number of illustrations from photographs, 
together with several curious prints presumably from 
Japanese pictorial papers. For the reader who 
wants to arrive as shortly and conveniently as pos- 
sible at a comprehensive view of the Chino-Japanese 
war we have seen no better book than this by " Vla- 
dimir." 

Italian theories In Ferri ' s "Criminal Sociology" 
of the treatment (Appleton), edited by W. D. Mor- 
of criminals. rison, the English reader is furnished 
with a translation of a part of one of the most im- 
portant works of the " Italian school " of criminol- 
ogy. Current discussions show that this school is 
charged with exclusive attention to craniology ; Pro- 



fessor Ferri seeks to show that psychological, social, 
and physical elements are regarded by those whom 
he represents. The main contention of the writer 
is that prisons and penalties do not reform and are 
not deterrent ; that to increase severity would bru- 
talize society and would have no effect on confirmed 
criminals, because these lack moral sense and fore- 
sight ; and therefore social defense can be secured 
only by preventive measures. He shows how legal 
definitions of crime and judicial procedure are influ- 
enced by traditions from a time when superstition 
and revenge, rather than science, determined meth- 
ods of punishment. Radical changes are demanded 
in the present state of knowledge. Treatment must 
be adapted to the actual nature of the criminal, and 
not to a theoretical classification of offenses. The 
essential differences among law-breakers must be 
the basis of penal systems. Some of the reforms 
suggested are regarded from an Italian point of 
view, and some are of speculative interest ; but the 
essential principles are worthy of careful attention. 

" In New England Fields and 
Sketch* Woods" (Houghton), by Rowland 

out-of-doors. \ i J PI 

E. Robinson, is a volume of short 
sketches, fifty-seven in all, dealing with the out-of- 
door life of man and beast. The papers, many of 
which were originally published in " Forest and 
Stream," are written by a man who is by instinct 
both sportsman and lover of nature. His delinea- 
tions of the small denizens of the woods, fields, and 
river-sides show long and close familiarity with their 
traits and habits, as well as a real affection for those 
who are so often the victims of the sportsman's gun. 
Throughout the book, love of sport and love of ani- 
mals are at war, but in " A Plea for the Unpro- 
tected " the latter comes uppermost. Some of the 
best work in the book is contained in the twelve 
essays describing the months of the year. The pic- 
ture in each one is complete and distinct, showing 
keen discrimination and discernment of the typical 
qualities of the passing seasons. The language for 
the most part is well chosen. The chief fault is one 
that might have been remedied by omitting a few 
of the papers, in other words, there is at times an 
impression of monotony ; but no lover of nature can 
fail to enjoy these simple and untechnical sketches. 
An added touch of interest is given to the volume 
by the fact that the author is now blind.

troduces Miss Phillips and her " Handbook of Ger-

us that this is a " distinct desideratum." The secret 
of its desirability is to be found in a casual refer- 
ence to " OxfDrd and Cambridge Local Examina- 
tions." A stident endeavoring to fatten himself 
on these parings must be a melancholy spectacle. 
It were no great praise to say that the task had 
been done as well as the conditions permit ; and

even this would scarcely be true. Mixed phrases, 
as " the ' epische Stoff ' "; italic catch-words, stand- 
ing now for authors, now for works ; unpardonable 
details, as the cause of Konrad von Wilrzburg's 
death; ill-judged proportion, as more space to 
Gryphius than to Walther von der Vogelweide, 
these are some of the defects in detail. 



Mr. B. 0. Flower's " The Century of 
A good book on gir Thomas More " (Arena Co.) rep- 

the Renaissance. , F 

resents an attempt to condense into 
a small volume suited to the requirements of the 
busy reader a fairly comprehensive account of the 
period of the Renaissance and the Reformation 
(1450-1550) and its representative worthies. The 
author has evidently been at some pains to " get 
up " his subject, and he treats it intelligently and 
with due enthusiasm. The text is divided under 
such chapter-headings as : " Western Europe dur- 
ing the Century "; " The Reformation and Some of 
its leading Spirits "; " Some Fatal Figures of the 
Italian Renaissance "; "The France of the Period "; 
" The England of Sir Thomas More "; etc. There 
are a number of portraits, and altogether the book 
is a good one for popular reading. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The new edition of Poe published by the J. B. Lip- 
pincott Co. at once challenges comparison with the edi- 
tion recently edited by Messrs. Stedman and Wood- 
berry. It is very neat in appearance, and it is offered 
at about half the price of the rival edition. There are 
eight volumes, each with three illustrations. But it has 
no critical apparatus whatever, and does not present so 
trustworthy and definitive a text as has been provided 
for the other edition. It aims, in fact, to present the 
works alone, which it does in a fairly satisfactory man- 
ner. The critical student will not be likely to view it 
with favor, although its cheapness and mechanical excel- 
lence will recommend it to a circle of readers that the 
Stedman- Woodberry edition would not be likely to reach 
at all. 

The editor of the " Columbian Knowledge " series 
(Roberts) has been singularly happy in the selection of 
subjects for the volumes that have thus far appeared. 
"Total Eclipses of the Sun," "Public Libraries in 
America," and " Arctic Discoveries " are all subjects of 
timely interest, and each is, in a sense, complete in itself 
that is, deserving of special treatment, although really 
but a part of some larger subject. General A. W. 
Greely's " Handbook of Arctic Discoveries " is essen- 
tially a manual of facts, concisely stated and well- 
arranged, condensed from the 50,000 pages i>f narrative 
that have grown up about the subject, mostly during 
the past half-century. The book is well supplied with 
maps, and will be found in every way helpful to those 
interested in Arctic. exploration. 

" The Statesman's Year-Book " for 1895, edited by 
Mr. J. Scott Keltie and Mr. I. P. A. Reijwick, is the 
thirty-third annual publication of that invaluable com- 
pendium of (usually) accurate informatioa. It repro- 
duces all the familiar features of earlier editions, and 
has been carefully corrected to date. The most note- 



worthy change is made in connection with the several 
sections relating to the navies of the world. These have 
all been thoroughly revised by Mr. S. W. Barnaby. A 
new feature is offered by the four maps that precede 
the text. These have for their subjects the frontier 
question on the Pamirs, the Indo-Chinese frontier ques- 
tion, the Venezuela-Guiana boundary question, and the 
recent Bechuanaland arrangements. Messrs. Macmillan 
& Co. are the publishers. 

The " Classics for Children " published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. have been enriched by the addition of the 
"Adventures of Hatini Ta'i." This work, translated 
from the Persian sixty-five years ago, and first published 
in English under the auspices of the Oriental Transla- 
tion Fund, has remained practically inaccessible until 
the present time, being now rescued by Mr. W. R. Alger, 
and brought within easy reach of the public. It is a 
series of tales not unlike the " Arabian Nights," and 
Mr. Alger is justified in declaring it " not one whit infe- 
rior to the very best of those world-renowned master- 
pieces." In its present popular form it will doubtless 
find many readers, not alone among the young, for it has 
a charm that appeals to all ages. 

The thirteenth series of the " Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity Studies in Historical and Political Science " has 
recently been completed by publication of the following 
monographs: "White Servitude in the Colony of Vir- 
ginia," by Mr. James C. Ballagh; " The Genesis of Cali- 
fornia's First Constitution," by Mr. R. D. Hunt; "Benja- 
min Franklin as an Economist," by Mr. W. A. Wetzel; 
" The Provisional Government of Maryland," by Mr. J. 
A. Silver ; and " Government and Religion of the Virginia 
Indians," by Mr. S. R. Hendren. Of the fourteenth series 
(1896), the following three numbers have been issued: 
" Constitutional History of Hawaii," by Mr. Henry E. 
Chambers; "The City Government of Baltimore," by 
Mr. Thaddeus P. Thomas; and "Colonial Origins of 
New England Senates," by Mr. F. L. Riley. These spe- 
cial historical studies are of great value and highly cred- 
itable to the institution that puts them forth. 

Mr. Lorenzo Sears is the author of a work entitled 
" The History of Oratory from the Age of Pericles to 
the Present Time " (Griggs). The author discusses the 
history, science, and philosophy of public discourse, with 
illustrations drawn from the literature of twenty-four 
centuries. Noting the place of each typical orator in 
the long history of the art, Mr. Sears has also sought 
to point out the rhetorical principles exemplified by 
him, and " to observe the trend of eloquence " iu the 
period to which he belongs. Such men as Aristotle, 
Cicero, Savonarola, Webster, Sumner, Phillips, and 
Curtis, are made the subjects of separate chapters while 
other chapters deal with such themes as " Attic Ora- 
tors," " Mediaeval Preachers," " Eccentric Eloquence," 
and " Oratory of the French Revolution." The whole 
work has been carefully done, and fills a place that 
has been vacant up to the present time. 

" Word Formation in the Roman Sermo Plebeius " 
is the title of a bulky dissertation by Mr. Frederic 
Taber Cooper, of Columbia College. It is " an histor- 
ical study of the development of vocabulary in vulgar 
and late Latin, with special reference to the Romance 
languages." The author's original plan contemplated 
nothing less than a historical grammar of the subject; 
but, as the material grew upon his hands, he found that 
he had collected under the head of word-formation alone 
enough matter to make up a substantial treatise. He 
hopes, however, to follow up the present work with a

volume of equal size upon plebeian syntax. The indus- 
try required for the preparation of this work must have 
been very great, and it speaks well for our universities 
that such dissertations should be put forth in their name. 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish the books. 

"The Individual and the State: An Essay on Jus- 
tice " (Ginn) is a Cornell thesis, presented for the doc- 
torate by Mr. Thomas W. Taylor, Jr. It presents a 
careful study of the literature of the subject, but reaches 
the somewhat unsatisfactory conclusion that " the ideal 
of Justice is purely subjective, binding only upon the 
individual holding it, and not applicable as a test of the 
Tightness or wrongness of any existing conditions." 
Those who have attempted to formulate a principle of 
justice notably Mr. Spencer come in for much sharp 
criticism before this negative conclusion is reached. 
Mr. Taylor is entitled to his opinion, but he has not said 
the last word upon this great subject. 

The Pegasus Club is a Philadelphia organization hav- 
ing for its purpose " the writing and study of poetry." 
Its members write poems and submit them anonymously 
to the Club " for criticism and acceptance or rejection." 
" The Year Book of the Pegasus" (Lippincott), a pamph- 
let volume now published, reproduces the best work 
submitted under the Club rules, and divulges the au- 
thorship of each piece. We note the familiar names 
of Mr. Owen Wister, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Mr. C. L. 
Moore, Mr. H. S. Morris, and Mr. F. H. Williams 
among the score or so unknown to us. A sonnet by Mr. 
Stedman also figures in this collection. A similar selec- 
tion will be published annually.

The first volume of William Carleton's " Traits and 
Stories of the Irish Peasantry," in a new edition with 
the Dent-Macmillan imprint, has just been received by 
us. It is edited by Mr. D. J. O'Donoghue, and the

By the publication of Part VIII., the first volume is 
completed of Dr. M. Jastrow's " Dictionary of the Tar- 
gumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the 
Midrashic Literature." Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons 
are the American publishers. 

The " Golden Treasury " series (Macmillan) has long 
included the " Religio Medici," and it was fitting to 
provide a companion volume for the " Hydrotaphia " 
and " Garden of Cyrus." The work, edited by the late 
W. A. Greenhill, has just appeared. 

The London correspondent of the New York " Critic " 
states that Mr. John Murray is to publish a new edition 
of Byron, and that he has, of hitherto unprinted ma- 
terial, a number of poems, many letters which were not 
shown to Moore, and a continuation of " Don Juan."

William Doxey, of San Francisco, publishes the pam- 
phlet. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce a complete edi- 
tion of Browning's works, in two volumes, with notes by 
the author included in no other edition. The same firm

" The Inlander," of Ann Arbor, prints a symposium 
on the value of athletic education for women. Twenty- 
five American authors have written brief communica- 
tions upon the subject, and the autograph letters are now 
offered for sale for the benefit of the women's gymna- 
sium. Bids may be sent to Miss Eatherine Puncheon, 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

Messrs. F. Warne & Co. announce that the new vol- 
ume in their " Public Men of To-day " series will be on 
Senor Castelar, by Mr. David Hannay. The same firm 
has in preparation a popular sketch of Pope Leo XIII., 
by Mr. Justin McCarthy, a volume of "Lancashire 
Idylls," by Mr. J. Marshall Mather, and a second series 
of " Wayside and Woodland Blossoms." 

The Syndicat des Socie'te's Litte'raires et Artistiques 
pour la Protection de la Proprie'te' Intellectuelle has 
sent us a " Note sur un Projet de Bill Qui Doit Etre 
Propose" au Parlement Canadien au Sujet de la Pro- 
prie'te' Litte'raire." It contains a protest adopted by the 
Syndicat at a meeting in January, and points out very 
emphatically the abuses sanctioned by the proposed law. 

Messrs. P. Blakiston, Son & Co., of Philadelphia, 
have just published a " Treatise on Hygiene," edited by 
Dr. J. Lane Notter, and Mr. R. H. Firth, F.R.C.S., 
based upon the well-known work of the late Dr. E. A. 
Parkes. The volume aims to take the place which 
" Parkes' Hygiene " has so long occupied as the stand- 
ard text-book for both English and American students. 

" Armenian Poems Rendered into English Verse by 
Alice Stone Black well " (Roberts) is the title-legend of 
a recent volume. Since Mrs. Blackwell confesses that 
her own knowledge of Armenian " does not extend much 
beyond the alphabet," the title description of the vol- 
ume must not be taken too literally. It seems that she 
has merely worked over into verse a number of prose 
translations made by her friends.

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the "easy-running Stearns"; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, tbe\better it is liked.

TOM QROQAN. A Novel. 

By F. HOPKINSON SMITH, author of " Colonel Carter of Cartersville," " A Gentleman Vagabond," etc. 

With 19 Illustrations by CHARLES S. REIXHART. In a strikingly decorative binding. 12mo, $1.50. 

" Tom Grogan " is, thus far, the crowning achievement of Mr. Smith's genius as a novelist. It attracted 
marked attention in its serial appearance by the delightful qualities of the story and its style, and also by its frank 
attitude on certain phases of the labor question, in which multitudes are interested. It is sure to cause warm 
discussion, and equally sure to win a very large circle of readers who know by experience or by hearsay how 
charmingly Mr. Smith's stories are told. It has been thoroughly revised. 



PIRATE GOLD. 

A Novel. By F. J. STIMSON. 16mo, $1.25. 
Mr. Stimson (" J. S. of Dale ") is no novice in story-telling. 
He has won an enviable reputation, which will be emphasized 
by " Pirate Gold," a story of Boston in the middle of this cen- 
tury. It is not an historical novel, but reproduces with great 
fidelity and charm the social atmosphere of the place and time. 
The season will bring few brighter, more readable novels. 



SPRING NOTES FROM TENNESSEE. 

By BRADFORD TOKREY, author of " A Florida Sketch- 
Book," " Birds in the Bush," " A Rambler's Lease," 
" The Foot-Path Way," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
A delightful group of papers containing: observations of 
birds and scenery in Tennessee, many of them on famous bat- 
tlefields Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, etc. Several of 
the papers have not before been printed, and all are charming. 



HISTORY OF PRUSSIA UNDER FREDERIC THE GREAT, 

1756-1757. 

By HERBERT TUTTLE, late Professor in Cornell University. With a Portrait and a Biographical Sketch 

by Professor HERBERT B. ADAMS. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $1.50. 

This book contains a thoroughly studied and admirably written account of the early part of the great Seven 
Tears' War, untangling its diplomacy, describing its battles, and forming a valuable addition to the three volumes 
previously written by Professor Tuttle on the history of Prussia. 



THE EXPANSION OF RELIGION. 

By E. WINCHESTER DONALD, D.D., Rector of Trinity Church, Boston. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
Here is a volume which cannot fail to be regarded as a valuable contribution to the religious literature of 
the day. Dr. Donald aims to show that religion is not to be confounded with ecclesiasticism, but is a permanent 
force in human affairs; and he attempts to trace its connection to-day with industrialism, socialism, education, 
organized Christianity, and the enlargement of human life. 



FOUR-HANDED FOLK. 

By OLIVE THORNE MILLER, author of " Bird- Ways," 

" In Nesting-Time," Little Brothers of the Air," "A 

Bird-Lover in the West." Illustrated. 16mo, $1.25. 

A very attractive book describing observations of various 

pets the kinkajou, "living balls," the lemur, marmoset, 

chimpanzee, ocelot, and several kinds of monkeys. 



THE LIFE OF NANCY. 

By SARAH ORNE JEWETT. 
Fourth Edition. 16mo, $1.25. 

" Miss Jewett's art is of that perfect sort which leaves the 
reader with a sense of complete satisfaction, at the same time 
that it defies description by its very simplicity." Brooklyn 
Eagle. 



MARS. 

By PERCIVAL LOWELL, author of " The Soul of the Far East," " Occult Japan," etc. 

With Illustrations. 8vo, $2.50. 

" Mr. Lowell's book is charming in more ways than one. His facile pen would make easy reading of the 
driest subject; and when it deals with a theme so fascinating as that of the conditions of life on another planet, 
hard-hearted indeed must be the critic who does not find himself ready to embrace conclusions which he would 
have contemptuously rejected if reached by a rougher path." New York Evening Post.

The most important

Boston Traveler. 



Edited, with a General Introduction, Prefaces, and Appendices, by GEORGE DTTKUY. Translated. With Seven Portraits

OUTLOOK, N. Y. "We do not know how we can look at this 
melodrama with the eyes of one of its prin- 
cipal actors better than through the medium of these Memoirs of 
Karras. The reader is put by Barras among the very personages, he 
breathes the fetid atmosphere, looks through the lurid glare, discerns 
the cowardice masked beneath the mock heroic, the despotic temper 
wrapping itself in the colors of liberty, the lying which unblushingly 
offers its services to truth, the steel-like cruelty scabbarded in profes- 
sions of humanity. Just because of the vices of the author, these 
Memoirs disclose the very spirit of the epoch. For this they will pos- 
sess a unique value to the student not only of the French Revolution, 
but also of human nature. 

CRITIC, N. Y. These Memoirs are undoubtedly of great his- 
- torical value. Barras had a sharp eye as well 
as a sharp pen. He was in the midst of it all, lived through the Terror 
in constant danger of the guillotine, and saw the sordid inside of the 
great upheaval that ushered in the regime moderne. 



LONDON DAILY NEWS. The book is indispensable to 
- all who would understand the 

French Revolution and the Consulate and the Empire that followed 
it. ... It is a work of the first importance. 

CHRISTIAN WORK, N. Y. In spite of all that can justly 

be said against them, these 

Memoirs have a value which will be lasting. They give us much as 
relating to the tempestuous times of the great Revolution which we 
have not had before. They are absorbingly interesting. 

NEW YORK TIMES. Of all the books relating to the Na- 

poleonic period that have appeared in 

recent years, none is superior to, and but few compare with, these 
Memoirs in throwing light upon a time as interesting as any with which 
history has to deal. 

DIAL, CHICAGO. It is the personal side of the Memoirs, the 
- anecdotes, bits of genre-painting, and por- 
traiture that lend them their peculiar interest, and explain the sensa- 
tion they have excited in France and the impatience with which the 
closing volumes are awaited.

A NEW ISSUE OF 

CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA 

AT A POPULAR PRICE. 

A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge, containing upwards of 30,000 articles ; illustrated by more than 

3,500 engravings; over 11,000,000 words, and 17,560 columns of reading matter. 

Rewritten and Enlarged by American and English Editors. International in Character. Based upon the

The New Popular Edition. In Ten Volumes. Imperial Octavo. 

Cloth Binding, $20.00 net; Half Leather Binding, $25.00 net. 

CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA is in use as a book of reference wherever the English language is known. 
The first edition of this great work was completed in 1868. From this point for over twenty years a process 
of correction and revision was continued from year to year, thus bringing the information down to the latest pos- 
sible date. 

But this process of revising and altering could not be carried on indefinitely. Many articles called for an en- 
tirely different treatment. New subjects of interest demanded admittance; while some have lost their claim to 
the prominence given them twenty-five years ago. The Publishers therefore have set up and electrotyped the 
work afresh for this new edition, in the preparation of which every line of the previous edition has been scrutin- 
ized, and the articles rewritten, partially or entire, while new articles have been prepared to embrace all new 
subjects required by the progress of knowledge. This edition is consequently a new encyclopaedia, comprising 
the latest information in the whole range of human knowledge, and it is offered to the public at a reduction of 
one-third from the price of any previous editions. Furthermore, we have withdrawn our former trade editions 
from the market.

Ready Early in May. 

The Puppet- Booth, by Henry B. Fuller, 

Author of "With the Procession," " The Chevalier of Pensieri- Vani," " The Chatelaine of La Trinite," etc. 

A book of twelve highly imaginative plays of a kind new to American literature. Each is confined to a 
single act, and they are powerful and striking, with a weirdness suggestive of Maeterlinck, but with more 
humor. One is obviously a parody on Ibsen, and another a sly hit at Weyman and Anthony Hope. Those 
who liked Mr. Fuller's earlier work will enjoy especially this new volume. Price, $1.25. 



A Strange, Sad Comedy. 

By Molly Elliot Seawell, 

Author of " Maid Marian, and Other Stories," " The 
Berkeleys and their Neighbors," etc. 

An international romance, showing the conflict of ideals 
and prejudices inevitably to be observed when English peo- 
ple of the upper class are brought into contact with recently 
enriched New Yorkers and impoverished Southerners. The 
story shows abundant humor. Price, $1.25. 

The White Pine: A study. 

By Clifford Pinchott and Henry S. Graves. 

An invaluable contribution to the natural history of the 
most important lumbering tree in North America. The mo- 
tive that prompted its preparation was a desire to assist in 
making clear the real nature of forestry and to hasten the 
general introduction of right methods of forest management. 
Sir. Pinchot's work as a consulting forester is best known in 
connection with the management of Biltmore Forest in North 
Carolina. Price, $1.00. 



Notes of the Night. 

By Charles C. Abbott, 

Author of " A Naturalist's Rambles about Home,"

aspects of nature was never more strikingly exemplified 
than in the pages of this book. Price, $1.50.

of S. Weir Mitchell, 

Author of "When All the Woods are Green," "In War 

Time" " Characteristics" etc.

Mr. William Astor Chapter's description of his travels and Explorations in Eastern Africa forms one of the most deeply 

interesting books published in recent years. Mr. Chanler and his companion, Lieutenant von Hohnel, himself a noted explorer, 

were the first white men to penetrate into many of the regions here described, and the account of their adventures and perils, 

their achievements and their misfortunes, forms a narrative fascinating 1 not alone to the traveller and the scientist, but also, 

and more especially, to the sportsman and to the lover of exciting romance.

"One of the most useful and beautiful books about Nature which has yet come from the press is Mabel Osgood Wright's ' Birdcraft.' The

to afford the means of a swift identification and classification of every bird. . . . Such a book opens a new world of delight." The Outlook.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



The Seats of the Mighty. 

Being the Memoirs of Captain ROBERT MORAY, sometime an 
Officer in the Virginia Regiment, and afterwards of Ara- 
herst's Regiment. By GILBERT PARKER, author of " Pierre 
and his People," "The Trail of the Sword," "The Tres- 
passer," etc. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
For the time of his story Mr. Parker has chosen the most absorbing 
period of the romantic eighteenth-century history of Quebec. The cur- 
tain rises soon after General Braddock's defeat in Virginia, and the hero, 
a prisoner in Quebec, curiously entangled in the intrigues of La Pompa- 
dour, becomes a part of a strange history, full of adventure and the 
stress of peril, which culminates only after Wolfe's victory over Mont- 
calm. The material offered by the life and history of old Quebec has 
never been utilized for the purposes of fiction with the command of plot 
and incident, the mastery of local color, and the splendid realization of 
dramatic situations shown in this distinguished and moving romance. 
The illustrations preserve the atmosphere of the text, for they present 
the famous buildings, gates, and battle-grounds as they appeared at the 
time of the hero's imprisonment in Quebec. 

A Treatise on Surveying. 

Comprising the Theory and Practice. By WIU^IAM M. 
GILLESPIE, LL.D., formerly Professor of Civil Engineering 
in Union College. New edition, revised and enlarged by 
CADY STALET, Ph.D., President of Case School of Applied 
Science. In two volumes. Vol. I., Plane Surveying ; Vol. 
II., Higher Surveying. Vol. I. now ready. 8vo, cloth, $2.50 
per vol. 

An entirely new edition of Gillespie's Surveying, which has for so 
many years been the standard text-book on surveying, has just been 
completed, with new plates and new matter added to bring it in all re- 
spects up to present requirements. The whole work has been revised 
and improved, and the Higher Surveying considerably extended, especi- 
ally in the line of Geodesy and allied subjects. As this increases the 
amount of matter in the book, and as the advanced work is not needed 
in the preparatory schools and in colleges where only a limited amount 
of surveying is taught, it has been deemed best to publish the work in 
two separate parts.

Chronicles of Martin Hewitt. 

By ARTHUR MORRISON, author of " Tales of Mean Streets," 
etc. No. 191, Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 
50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 

Martin Hewitt, the investigator, has proved himself a worthy rival 
to Sherlock Holmes. In this volume the strange adventures which befell 
him, his subtle inferences, and his adroit solutions of the problems 
offered by puzzling crimes are set forth with a vividness and dramatic 
interest which will give this book high rank among the best literature 
of the detection of crime. 

The School System of Ontario. 

By the Hon. GEORGE W. Ross, LL.D., Minister of Education 
for the Province of Ontario. Vol. XXXVIII., International 
Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

This book shows the evolution of the school system of Ontario from 
its inception down to the present time. Its main purpose, however, is 
to supply information with regard to the organization and management 
of the different departments of the system, and the means which have 
been provided for promoting its efficiency through uniform examina- 
tions, the training of teachers in both public and high schools, and its 
thorough supervision by means of the Education Department. 



The Warfare of Science with 
Theology. 

A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Chris- 
tendom. By ANDREW D. WHITE, LL.D., late President 
and Professor of History at Cornell University. In two 
volumes. 8vo, cloth, $5.00. 

In this important, suggestive, and instructive work, which embodies 
the study and researches of twenty years, the author " simply tries to 
let the light of historical truth into that decaying mass of outworn 
thought which attaches the modern world to mediaeval conceptions of 
Christianity, and which still lingers among us a most serious barrier 
to religion and morals, and a menace to the whole normal evolution of 
society. . . . My belief is that in the field left to them their proper 
field the clergy will more and more, as they cease to strugge against 
scientific methods and conclusions, do work even nobler and more beau- 
tiful than anything they have heretofore done. And this is saying much. 
My conviction is that Science, though it has evidently conquered Dog- 
matic Theology, based on Biblical texts and ancient modes of thought, 
will go hand in hand with Religion ; and that although theological con- 
trol will continue to diminish, Religion, as seen in the recognition of ' a 
Power in the universe, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness,' 
and in the love of God and of our neighbor, will steadily grow stronger 
and stronger, not only in the American institutions of learning, but in 
the world at large." From the Introduction. 

The Reds of the Midi. 

An Episode of the French Revolution. By FELIX GRAS. 

Translated from the Provengal by Mrs. CATHARINE A. 

JANVIER. With an Introduction by THOMAS A. JANVIER. 

With Frontispiece. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" In all French history there is no more inspiring episode than that 
with which M. Gras deals in this story : the march to Paris and the do- 
ings in Paris of that Marseilles Battalion, made of men who were sworn 
to cast down ' the tyrant,' and knew ' how to die.' His epitome of the 
motive power of the Revolution in the feelings of one of its individual 
peasant parts is the very essence of simplicity and directness. His 
method has the largeness and the clearness of the Greek drama. The 
motives are distinct. The action is free and bold. The climax is inevit- 
able, and the story has a place entirely apart from all the fiction of the 
French Revolution with which I am acquainted." From Mr. Janvier 1 a 
Introduction. 

The Dancer in Yellow. 

By W. E. NORRIS, author of "A Victim of Good Luck," 
" Mademoiselle de Mersac," etc. No. 190, Town and Coun- 
try Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 
Mr. Norris is always entertaining, agreeable, and delightful, and he 

is seen at his best in this excellent novel. 

Hypnotism, Mesmerism, and the 
New Witchcraft. 

By ERNEST HART, formerly Surgeon to the West London 

Hospital, and Ophthalmic Surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital, 

London. With 20 Illustrations. New edition, enlarged and 

revised. With new chapters on "The Eternal Gullible" 

and " The Hypnotism of Trilby." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Mr. Hart holds it as proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the 

hypnotic condition is an admitted clinical fact, and declares that the 

practice of hypnotism, except by skilled physicians, should be forbidden. 

He affirms its therapeutic uselessness, and condemns the practice because 

of the possibilities of social mischiefs. . . . His personal experiences in 

the ' New Witchcraft ' enable him to exercise a critical check on the wild 

theories and unsupported assertions of others." Philadelphia Ledger 

A Flash of Summer. 

By Mrs. W. K. CLIFFORD, author of "Love Letters of a 
Worldly Woman," " Aunt Anne," etc. No. 189, Town and 
Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 
Mrs. Clifford's rank as one of the most brilliant writers of modern 

literary London is known to all readers. This novel is regarded as a 

work of especial strength.

THE TIE THAT BINDS. 

The beautiful story of the Athenian captives 
at Syracuse, set free and restored with all hon- 
ors to their fatherland because they could recite 
verses from the poet best beloved of their cap- 
tors, has been made familiar to us all by two 
among the noblest works of Robert Browning. 
" Any such happy man had prompt reward," 
our poet tells us, 

" If he lay bleeding on the battle-field 
They stanched his wounds, and gave him drink and food ; 
If he were slave i' the house, for reverence 
They rose up, bowed to who proved master now, 
And bade him go free, thank Euripides ! 
Ay, and such did so : many such, he said, 
Returning home to Athens, sought him out, 
The old bard in the solitary house, 
And thanked him ere they went to sacrifice." 

This story has much more than the virtue of an 
anecdote ; it has rather the significance of an 
eternal truth, of the everlasting power of liter- 
ature to reconcile differences, to soften the as- 
perities of intercourse between nations, to 
strengthen the bonds of sympathy between hu- 
man beings, and to offer promise of that " Par- 
liament of man, the Federation of the world," 
which the poet still insists upon foreseeing, 
however idle his dream be held by the reluctant 
and short-sighted multitude. 

While the vision of the seer halts at nothing 
short of this ideal of the brotherhood of man 
finally accomplished, he whose faith is less firm 
and whose gaze cannot descry things hidden so 
deep in the mists of the future may still find 
in the possession of a common speech some 
earnest of a harmonious union for all to whom 
that speech is native. Particularly true is this 
of us born to the use of the English language, 

t fS " Who speak the tongue 

That Shakespeare spake, the faith and morals hold 
Which Milton held." 

A common language is the tie that binds men 
together almost in spite of themselves. This is 
true even if the language be one that has never 
risen to supreme excellence of expression upon 
the lips of the literary artist. A striking illus- 
tration of this fact is offered by Miss Olive 
Schreiner, in her account of the uncouth Taal 
of the Boer. The Boer himself is of mixed 
Dutch and Huguenot strain, and his speech is 
an almost inconceivably degraded dialect of the 
Dutch tongue. It is absolutely without a liter- 



260 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



ature, and is probably incapable of originating 
one. Yet it has fused into a compact nation- 
ality the heterogeneous elements that went to 
the making of the Boer, and its unifying influ- 
ence compels our admiration and our respect. 
If this be the power of a rough and poverty- 
stricken dialect, what limits may be set to the 
potency of so rich and refined an instrument of 
intercourse as the English language ? It is not 
from mere pride of race that the philosophical 
observer rejoices in the amazing spread of the 
English language over the face of the earth. 
It is rather that he feels the immense signifi- 
cance to the future of mankind that must at- 
tach to an ever-widening use of the tongue in 
whose literature are embodied the noblest civic 
and ethical ideals of the modern world. 

Ten generations have now followed one an- 
other since the man who in English speech gave 
supreme expression to these ideals was with us 
in the flesh. It is three centuries since the 
gentlest, and wisest, and deepest of modern 
souls was building the monument of song that 
none knew better than himself " would outlive 
the perishing body of men and things till the 
Resurrection of the Dead." And who will dare 
say that the work of Shakespeare is more than 
barely begun ? Year after year we commemo- 
rate the anniversary of his birth, and each year 
we look back with reverence to the past because 
of the promise that it gives us for the future. 
The words spoken at the recent Stratford cele- 
bration by the man who so worthily represents 
among the English people the best elements of 
American culture, and the message of good will 
sent to the Birmingham gathering by the Chief 
Magistrate of our Republic, were both expres- 
sions of the feeling that a common claim to 
Shakespeare constitutes between England and 
the United States a bond of union too strong 
to be broken by differences that might cause 
other nations to fly at one another's throats, too 
sacred to be made the sport of political passion 
or weakened by petty international jealousies. 

The Philistine, we suppose, smiled at Mr. 
Cleveland's message, deeming it a bit of inef- 
fectual but harmless sentimentality, yet the 
message embodied a deeper truth than ever en- 
tered into the self-satisfied Philistine conscious- 
ness. Doubtless, also, he smiled at Mr. Bay- 
ard's assertion that America claimed Shake- 
speare no less than England, yet that too is the 
deepest kind of a truth. There is much reason 
to believe that the teaching of American his- 
tory in our public schools leaves dominant in 
the child's mind an impression that England 



is our hereditary enemy. How much better 
it would be, and how much more essentially 
just, to emphasize the fact that, although tem- 
porary differences have now and then arisen 
between the two nations, yet these are as noth- 
ing in comparison with the glory of their com- 
mon inheritance ; that English history, from 
Alfred to Cromwell, belongs to us as rightfully 
as to our kinsmen over-sea, and should be to us 
a source of no less pride than that we justly 
take in the continuation of the history through 
Washington down to Lincoln. That this is the 
view ultimately to obtain among the English- 
speaking peoples seems to us certain. The very 
stars in their courses are working to bring it 
about, and the quiet, irresistible influence of a 
common intellectual tradition will some day ac- 
complish a closer and more vital union between 
the scattered sections of the English family 
than was ever cemented by bond of dynasty or 
political organization in the history of the 
world. There is a larger patriotism than that 
of the state, a wider fellowship than that of 
the geographical area ; it is in community of 
achievement and aspiration that men are in 
truth brothers, and it is in literature that they 
find their real relationship. 

The mutterings of war between the two great 
English-speaking peoples recently called forth 
by a reckless play in the politico-diplomatic 
game have not been wholly evil in their effect. 
If they have been accompanied by a melancholy 
display of truculence on the part of time serv- 
ing politicians and journalists, they have also 
served to make clear the almost absolute unan- 
imity of the better elements of English-speaking 
society in rejecting the thought of such a war 
as a horror unspeakable and unthinkable. That 
it would be essentially civil war has been the 
general verdict of sober-minded observers, for 
the essential characteristic of civil war is that 
the opposing forces should be sharers of the 
same sympathies and ideals, whether sharing 
or not the same governmental machinery. If 
all civilized nations knew each other as well as 
the sections of the English race know each 
other, all war would be civil war, and burdened 
with the awful responsibilities of such strife. 
The jingoes and the fomenters of international 
ill-feeling are poor prophets. We prefer to pin 
our faith to the prophecy of the distinguished 
Englishman who spoke last year to the mem- 
bers of the Harvard Law School. Upon that 
occasion, Sir Frederick Pollock, discussing 
" The Vocation of the Common Law," brought 
his remarks to a close with a peroration so sig-

nificant and so eloquent that we cannot resist 
the temptation to borrow it for the adornment 
of our own discussion of so nearly - allied a 
theme. " Dreams are not versed in issuable 
matter, and have no dates. Only I feel that 
this one looks forward, and will be seen as wak- 
ing light some day. If anyone, being of little 
faith or over-curious, must needs ask in what 
day, I can answer only in the same fashion. 
We may know the signs, though we know not 
when they will come. These things will be 
when we look back on our dissensions in the 
past as brethren grown up to man's estate and 
dwelling in unity look back upon the bicker- 
ings of the nursery and the jealousies of the 
class-room ; when there is no use for the word 
* foreigner ' between Cape Wrath and the 
Rio Grande, and the federated navies of the 
English-speaking nations keep the peace of the 
ocean under the Northern Lights and under the 
Southern Cross, from Vancouver to Sydney, 
and from the Channel to the Gulf of Mexico ; 
when an indestructible union of even wider 
grasp and higher potency than the federal bond 
of these States has knit our descendants into 
an invincible and indestructible concord." 



THE SELECTION OF FELICITOUS 
BOOK TITLES. 

Mr. Hardy has again changed the title of his last 
novel. It was at first " The Simpletons," which was 
probably abandoned on account of its similarity to 
Charles Reade's " A Simpleton "; it was changed 
for " Harper's Magazine " to " Hearts Insurgent," 
and it has become in book form, " Jude the Ob- 
scure." This shows the care and thought which 
authors give to the selection of suitable names for 
their books, and their effort to gain for them the 
popular ear. 

In an article published in " The Atlantic Monthly " 
for March, 1895, entitled " Some Confessions of a 
Novel- Writer," Mr. Trowbridge tells of the great 
trouble he had in giving a satisfactory name to his 
favorite and popular novel, " Neighbor Jackwood." 
He says : " A score of titles were considered, only 
to be rejected. At last I settled down upon ' Jack- 
wood,' but felt the need of joining to that name some 
characteristic phrase or epithet. Thus I was led to 
think of this Scriptural motto for the title-page, 
' And a certain woman went down from Jerusalem 
to Jericho, and fell among thieves,' which suggested 
the question, ' Who was the neighbor unto this 
woman ? ' and the answer, ' Neighbor Jackwood,' 
and I had my title." 

D'Israeli said that were it inquired of an ingen- 
ious writer what page of his book had caused him 



most perplexity, he would often point to the title- 
page. He probably spoke from his own experience, 
as the changes he made in his own titles evinced 
the value he placed on attractive ones. His most 
successful book figures in the first edition as "Anec- 
dotes, Sketches, and Observations, Literary, Crit- 
ical, and Historical "; he later invested it with the 
happy title of " Curiosities of Literature." Those 
were the times when wordy titles were fashionable, 
and he made like changes in his other books. He 
referred to an English novel published as " The 
Champion of Virtue " which could find no readers, 
but afterwards passed through several editions un- 
der the happier invitation of " The Old English 
Baron." 

In poetry also a felicitous title is of service. 
Lowell writes of a new volume of poems in the hands 
of the printer, " I had decided to put the ' June 
Idyl ' in the forefront and call it a ' June Idyl and 
Other Poems,' but Fields told me that Whittier's 
new volume was to be called ' A Summer Idyl.' " 
Then he thought of " Appledore"; later concluded 
to finish his " Voyage to Vinland " (begun eighteen 
years previous), and make the title " A Voyage to 
Vinland and Other Poems." Mr. Fields would not 
listen to this, and proposed he rechristen the Idyl, 
" Elmwood," and name the book after that. This 
to Lowell seemed too personal, like " throwing 
my sanctuary open to the public and making a show- 
house of my hermitage." Finally he hit upon "Un- 
der the Willows," in place of a " June Idyl," and 
this settled the question. " Pictures from Apple- 
dore " was first printed in " The Crayon," as " My 
Appledore Gallery." In March, 1870, Lowell writes 
to Leslie Stephen : " I am glad you like ' The Ca- 
thedral.' . . . The name was none of my choosing. 
I called it 'A Day at Chartres ' and Fields re-chris- 
tened it." Again (December, 1886), Lowell offers 
a short poem to Aldrich for the "Atlantic," saying, 
What shall I call it? Will ' A Grumble ' do? " 
It was finally named " Fact or Fancy." 

That Hawthorne's " Marble Faun " appeared in 
England under the title of " A Transformation " is 
well known. This was chosen to please his pub- 
lisher, and Hawthorne said of it, " It gives one the 
idea of Harlequin in a pantomime." But the title 
by which we know it does not fully characterize the 
story, as the Marble Faun is only casually referred 
to ; the real subject being the mysterious Donatello 
the living faun, and notwithstanding the deserved 
success of the book, the title is not so well chosen as 
others of Hawthorne. 

Walter Scott in his introduction to " Rob Roy " 
said that when he planned the novel he was at loss 
for a title " a good name being very nearly of as 
much consequence in literature as in life," and he 
adds that the title " Rob Roy " was suggested hy 
Mr. Constable, "whose sagacity and experience 
foresaw the germ of popularity which it contained." 
Lockhart writes of the great difficulty Constable 
bad in inducing Scott to adopt his suggestion that 
the name of the real hero would be the best possi- 



262 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



ble name for the book. " Nay," said Scott, " never 
let me have to write up to a name. You well know 
I have generally adopted a title that told nothing." 
To the same judicious adviser is due the title of 
" Kenilworth," which Scott wished to call, like 
Mickle's ballad, " Cumnor Hall," but yielded to 
Constable's wishes and substituted " Kenilworth," 
notwithstanding Ballantyne's hint that the result 
would be " something worthy of a kennel." Lock- 
hart says that Constable had every reason to be satis- 
fied with this child of his christening. The novel 
" Redgauntlet " had made considerable progress at 
press before Constable and Ballantyne could per- 
suade Scott to substitute that title for " Herries," his 
first choice. After the publication of " The Monas- 
tery," Constable wished Scott to call the succeeding 
novel "The Nunnery," instead of "The Abbot," but 
in this instance Scott wisely stood by his first choice. 
Constable certainly had a genius for choosing titles. 
Scott was equally fastidious in naming his poems. 
He refers repeatedly in his letters to a poem he is 
writing to be entitled " The Nameless Glen," and 
later mentions it as " The Lord of the Isles," a title 
which had suggested itself to him as more striking. 
Often his first choice was used as a sub-title, as 
" The Fair Maid of Perth, or St. Valentine's Eve," 
" Anne of Geierstein, or the Maid of the Mist," as 
he could not decide to abandon them wholly. 

Southey's " Roderick the Last of the Goths," was 
first called " Don Pelayo." 

Charles Dickens often changed a title after choos- 
ing it. " Barnaby Rudge," that earnest plea for 
tolerance and the abolition of capital punishment, 
was announced for many months under the name of 
" Gabriel Vardon." During the twenty months of 
the serial publication of " Dombey and Son," its 
title was " Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and 
Son, Wholesale, Retail, and for Exportation "; but 
on its completion in 1848, its present admirable title 
was adopted. Dickens's favorite child, " David Cop- 
perfield," was originally brought out under this title : 
"The Personal History, Adventures, Experiences, 
and Observations of David Copperfield the Younger, 
of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to 
be published on any account)." Dickens followed 
the example of his avowed master Smollett and at 
first gave a novel the title of its hero or heroine, 
even going so far as to adopt the alliteration of 
" Peregrine Pickle " and " Roderick Random " as a 
model for " Nicholas Nickleby "; but he broke away 
from this habit, and his titles are generally original 
and striking. "Bleak House" was first called 
"Tom-All-Alone's," and certainly in this case second 
thoughts were best. 

George Eliot considered the subject one of real 
importance and in her Journal and Letters devotes 
much space to it. " The Mill on the Floss " was 
first called by her, " Sister Maggie." Under date 
of Jan. 3, 1860, she writes to Mr. John Blackwood : 
" We are demurring about the title. Mr. Lewes pre- 
fers ' The House of Tulliver, or Life on the Floss ' 
to our old notion of ' Sister Maggie '; ' The Tulli- 



vers, or Life on the Floss ' has the advantage of 
slipping easily off the lazy English tongue, but it is 
after too common a fashion ( ' The Newcomes,' 
'The Bertrams,' etc.); then there is 'The Tulliver 
Family, or Life on the Floss.' Pray meditate and 
give us your opinion." After some further corre- 
spondence, she urges Mr. Blackwood to give the 
casting vote, and in reply to his suggestion, writes : 
" ' The Mill on the Floss ' be it then." 

Anthony Trollope says he first intended to call 
his novel " Can you Forgive Her " by the title of 
" The Noble Jilt "; but he was afraid the critics 
might throw a doubt on the nobility, and that there 
was more of tentative humility in that which he at 
last adopted. 

Few writers, however, made more changes in their 
efforts to satisfactorily christen their novels than 
Charles Reade. While it was in press he changed 
" It is Never too Late to Mend," from " Susan Mer- 
ton," its original title. He gives his reasons in de- 
tail to his publishers, and says, " ' Susan Merton ' is 
a very bad title because under that title the book is 
a failure, Susan Merton being a third-rate character 
in point of invention and color. On this change I 
am peremptory and sensitive too. As it is cruel to 
make you lose the effect of past advertisements, I 
suppose you must add ' or Susan Merton,' if you are 
bent on it ; but if so, ' It is Never too Late to Mend ' 
must be the first title. But even this is against my 
judgment." Reade showed his pleasure when the 
title proved a hit. " The Cloister and the Hearth " 
was printed in part under the title of " A Good 
Fight." When he dramatized one of his novels he 
changed the title. " Peg Woffington " was drama- 
tized as "Masks and Faces," and "A Terrible 
Temptation " became, as a play, " The Double Mar- 
riage." 

Carleton Coffin's " The Boys of '61," was origin- 
ally " Four Years of Fighting." 

Many other illustrations might be given to show 
that authors realise that the reading public is likely 
to be, "Charm'd with the foolish whistling of a 
name." MARY R. SILSBT. 



LEON SAY, the distinguished economist, died on the 
twenty-first of April, at the age of sixty-nine. He was 
a grandson of Jean Baptiste Say, and worthily carried 
on the liberal economic tradition of the family. Shortly 
after the repeal of the Corn Laws, he visited England 
in the company of Bastiat, and made the acquaintance 
of Cobden. He was a republican in 1848, and received 
his baptism of fire upon the barricades of that memor- 
able year. He opposed the Empire persistently from 
first to last. A director for forty years of the Chemin 
de Fer du Nord, a contributor to the " De*bats," a mem- 
ber of the National Assembly in 1871, four times Min- 
ister of Finance, a member of the Senate and its Presi- 
dent in 1880, an ambassador to England, and a member 
of the Academy, Say enjoyed about all the honors that 
the French nation can bestow upon a man, and lived a 
life remarkable for its activity and its usefulness. His 
many writings, mostly upon economic subjects, made him 
one of the first European authorities in his department.

" THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE." 

A CORRECTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is with a certain hesitation that we write you to 
correct the author of a somewhat bitter letter published 
in your journal for April 16, for we recognize the signa- 
ture as that of a gallant soldier, as well as a student of 
literature. But as the author of that letter labors under 
several misapprehensions, we think that he will be glad 
to learn the facts. 

" The Red Badge of Courage " was read and ac- 
cepted by us in December, 1894, and, in book form, it 
was first published in this country in October, 1895. 
Although the book was copyrighted in England at the 
same time, it was not formally published there for two 
months. Meantime the American journals had reviewed 
it and had begun an almost universal chorus of eulogy. 
October 19, 1895, the " New York Times " devoted a 
column and a half to a strong review of " this remark- 
able book." On October 13, the " Philadelphia Press " 
compared Mr. Crane and Bret Harte, not to the disad- 
vantage of the former. On October 26, the " New York 
Mail and Express," in one of several notices, said, " The 
author has more than talent there is genius in the 
book." On October 26, the " Boston Transcript," in 
speaking of " this tremendous grasping of the glory and 
carnage of war," added at the close of a long and enthus- 
iastic review, " The book forces upon the reader the con- 
viction of what fighting really means." Other favorable 
reviews appeared in October issues of the following 
American newspapers : " New York Herald," " Brooklyn 
Eagle," Cleveland World," St. Paul Pioneer Press," 
Boston Daily Advertiser," " New York World," " St. 
Paul Globe," " New York Commercial Advertiser," 
" Kansas City Journal," " Chicago Evening Post," " Bos- 
ton Courier," " Cleveland Plain Dealer," " Boston Bea- 
con," Hartford Times," Sioux City Times," " New 
Haven Leader," and " Minneapolis Journal," and to these 
names, taken almost at random, we might add many 
others. These journals reviewed "The Red Badge" 
favorably in October, and others, including weeklies like 
" The Critic " and " The Outlook," followed in Novem- 
ber with emphatic recognition of the strength and high 
talent shown in the book. 

It was not until the end of November, two months 
after publication here, that the first reviews appeared 
in England. By that time American reviewers from 
Maine to California had " greeted " the book with the 
highest " encomiums." The English " encomiums " be- 
came specially marked in late December, January, and 
February. 

We state these facts in view of your correspondent's 
remarks that " So far, at least, the American papers 
have said very little about the merits or demerits of the 
book," and, " The book has very recently been reprinted 
in America," and, " Respect for our own people should 
have prevented its issue in this country." " Our coun- 
try " was the first to recognize Mr. Crane's genius, and 
our people have read his book so eagerly that it contin- 
ues to be the most popular work of fiction in the market, 
and it has been the one most talked of and written about 
since October last. 

A glance at the back of the " Red Badge " title-page 
would have shown that the book could not have been 
"first published" in England and "reprinted" here, 
while the literary departments of journals throughout 



our country, and the opinions of American men of let- 
ters like Mr. Howells and Mr. Hamlin Garland, have 
proved, happily, that Americans are ready to recognize 
American talent, and that, pare your correspondent, a 
prophet is not without honor even in his own country. 

As to other points, against the opinion of the gallant 
veteran who criticizes the book might be put the opin- 
ions of other veterans who have found only words of 
praise. D. APPLETON & COMPANY.

A RED BADGE OF BAD ENGLISH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAI,.) 

The animus of the articles in British magazines dur- 
ing our Civil War, as quoted by "A. C. McC." in your 
issue of April 16, sufficiently explains the English en- 
thusiasm for that literary absurdity called " The Red 
Badge of Courage." The trend of the whole work to 
prove the absence of such a thing as a gentleman in the 
union army may be justly expected to arouse the re- 
sentment of the class of whom "A. C. McC." is such a 
striking and honorable example. If this work is real- 
ism, it is realism run mad, rioting in all that is revolt- 
ing to man's best instincts, and utterly false to nature 
and to life. The Federal army doubtless possessed its 
share of ruffianly officers and stupid brainless men, but 
to select such and to hold them up as types is not true 
realism. Yet this is the work which one London period- 
ical compares favorably with the writings of Tolstoi' and 
Zola, and concerning which another London periodical 
says: "There is no possibility of resistance when once 
yon are in its grasp." 

The examples of hysterical composition given by "A. 
C. McC." might be supplemented by others fully as 
absurd taken from nearly every page of the book. 
Amid so much that is strained and affected there is not 
one agreeable character, hardly one praiseworthy senti- 
ment, and certainly not a new or original thought. But 
as the book is heralded as one of the literary successes 
of the year, it is but fair to call attention to a few ex- 
amples of its latter-day English. We can bear with 
equanimity the author's vulgarisms and mannerisms, his 
use of the split infinitive, and of such words as reliable, 
standpoint, and others which the slipshod fashion of the 
day has authorized by general usage. We may even 
attribute to " typographical errors " such careless con- 
structions as the following: 

" A shrill lamentation rang out filled with profane illusions 
to a general" (p. 193). 

" His anger was directed not so much against the men whom 
he knew were rushing" (p. 57). 

" Tottering among them was the rival color bearer, whom 
the youth saw had been bitten " (p. 222). 

But what is to be said of the following bright gems, 
culled almost at random while turning over these " irre- 
sistible " pages ? 

" Set upon it was the hard and dark lines " (p. 222) . 

"There was no obvious questionings, nor figurings, nor 
diagrams. There was apparently no considered loopholes" 
(p. 219). 

"He departed ladened. The youth went with his friend, 
feeling a desire to throw his heated body onto the stream " 
(p. 179). 

" Once he found himself almost into a swamp " (p. 79). 

" The majesty of he who dares give his life " (p. 68). 

" He could not flee no more than a little finger can commit 
a revolution from the hand " (p. 56). 

Eugene Field, not long before his death, remarked: 
"The one crime that cannot be righteously charged

against OUT Jin de siecle poetasters is slovenliness." Un- 
happily ourjtfn de siecle prose writers are peculiarly sus- 
ceptible to the charge. Can this general butchery of the 
language be the nemesis of " dialect literature," which 
has done so much to bring sensible and intelligible En- 
glish into ill repute ? j. L, ONDERDONK. 
Chicago, April 18, 1896. 

A WORD IN REPLY TO MR. STEARNS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On page 96 of his " Midsummer of Italian Art," in 
speaking of Michelangelo's " Captive," Mr. Stearns says: 
" The other Captive is, or was till recently, in the Boboli 
Gardens at Florence." Both of these gigantic statues 
have been in France since the reign of Francis I., and 
at least since the time of Napoleon they have stood in 
the Louvre side by side, so that no man could see one 
without seeing the other. Has the author of the above 
lines seen either ? And is a man who has not seen them 
competent to write about Michelangelo ? 

In his letter in your issue of April 1, Mr. Stearns 
excuses his error about the location of Raphael's " Dis- 
pute on the Sacrament " by saying that pictures in Italy 
have been recently changed about. This immense pic- 
ture is a fresco covering an entire wall, and is as immova- 
ble as the building itself. Could the writer ever have 
been in the Stanze ? And ought one who has never 
been there to write of Raphael ? 

If he will buy a copy of Baedeker he will find that 
the two windows of the Antecollegio face away from 
the Lido, and that without the use of the Roentgen rays 
the Lido cannot be seen from that room. 

Grimm does not say that II Pensieroso is Giuliano de' 
Medici. What he does is to correct the popular im- 
pression that he is Lorenzo the Magnificent, and to call 
attention to the fact that he is the worthless Lorenzo who 
begot Catherine de' Medici. 

I think that I am safe in saying that no living man 
has seen the Head of the Medusa in the Tribune of the 
Uffizi, and that no one who is not familiar with the con- 
tents of that and the preceding rooms ought to write 
about Italian art. 

Mr. Stearns is mistaken in supposing that I bear him 
any grudge. But a man ought not to write about Michel- 
angelo and Raphael without a patient and loving study 
of their original works, which no application to photo- 
graphs and engravings will supply. Mr. Stearns's book 
is interesting and well written, but it could not have 
been written upon the spot, and is usually at variance 
with the results of modern criticism. Q. < g_ ROSE.

A WORD ABOUT BOOK-MAKING. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In The Nation " for March 22, 1894, 1 made a short 
plea for " the index-making conscience," as something 
that must be cultivated by everyone who wishes both to 
write books and to love his fellow-men. Two years more 
of vexation have forced me once again to give to my feel- 
ings the relief of utterance. I especially desire to speak 
to those who review books in the pages of THE DIAL. 
It is upon THE DIAL and similar publications that any 
effort to secure a higher standard of book-making must 
depend. The average author or publisher will not have 
a loftier ideal of what a book ought to be than that which 
finds expression in our best literary reviews. It is one 
of the duties of such periodicals to police the field of 



literature. The mere mechanical excellences which 
mark a good book should certainly be insisted upon. 
Some of these are often lacking simply on account of the 
ignorance of the writer concerning the art of book- 
making, or of his indolence, or from a mixture of these 
causes. The standard in these matters is altogether too 
low, and our literary police should enforce the demand 
for improvement. 

A recent book is entitled " The Philosophy of English 
Literature," by Mr. Greenough White. The work is 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It contains 266 pages, 
but no table of contents, index, or any other handle of 
any kind whatever. One almost feels that the division 
of the work into paragraphs might have been omitted if 
any modern precedent could have been found for this. 
Mr. White cannot realize that what he has written is 
only a potential book, that ninety per cent of the useful- 
ness that his work might easily have had is now impos- 
sible to it. 

Why is there no index to the " Letters of Matthew 
Arnold " ? How can one disengage Arnold's judgments 
upon Goethe and other great writers from their entang- 
ling alliances with Flo, and Fan, and Dick, and Nelly, 
from the midst of buns and dinners, journeys and 
politics, from " coughs, and rheums, and phthisic, and 
catarrh " ? Is it right for the editor and the publishers 
to compel everyone who values the work to make his 
own index ? 

Dr. Henry Van Dyke perhaps thought that the clear 
arrangement of his book, " The Poetry of Tennyson " 
(Scribner's Sons), made an index unnecessary. So much 
labor has been expended by him upon the full and val- 
uable " Chronology " and list of " Biblical Quotations 
and Allusions" that one hesitates to find fault; but the 
work is too valuable to be without an index. I have 
made a full one for myself by putting into my copy of 
Tennyson a V with the page-references after the title 
of every poem upon which Dr. Van Dyke comments. 
Others may be able to make use of this suggestion. 

American and English book-makers are perhaps en- 
titled to the consolation that their standard in the mat- 
ter of indexes is higher than that of some other nations. 
A prominent New England professor who is publishing 
a work in Germany recently had the MS. for an elabo- 
rate index returned to him with the information that 
the publisher had no use for " that thing." It seems 
passing strange that Freytag's " Die Technik des 
Dramas," a work to which an index is especially neces- 
sary, should still be without one. The work appeared 
in 1863, and has reached at least the seventh edition. 
The second edition of the American translation (Griggs 
& Co.), with all its imperfections on its head, may well 
claim to be a more useful book than the original, even 
to one commanding both languages, because of its full 
index. I find it practicable, however, to use the English 
index in connection with the German text. That this 
full index is not a faultless one will be clear when I say 
that Kleist is not mentioned on the single page of the 
work to which reference is made, and that his name 
appears in four places that have been overlooked. 

Our very best books often have important defects of 
a mechanical or semi-mechanical nature. It will per- 
haps help to make this fact clear if in the remainder of 
this communication I mention only works which have 
with some justice been looked upon as models. Of 
course all of them have indexes, and I think good ones. 

A wealth of editorial conscience, together with a 
wealth of knowledge and taste, has gone into Mr. Sted- 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 




man's " Victorian Anthology " (Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co.). The book seems nearly perfect. I believe, how- 
ever, that occasional glossarial notes are needed, and 
that some notes of a more general nature would be very 
helpful. Because there are dialect poems, and because 
" the Rudyards " never " cease from kipling," even a 
practiced reader needs help now and then and the 
book is made for ordinary readers. Perhaps Mr. Sted- 
man was unwilling to explain anything for fear that he 
might be expected to interpret Carroll's " Jabberwocky." 

At first sight one would say that Professor Butcher's 
admirable book, " Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine 
Art, with a Critical Text and a Translation of the 
Poetics " (Macmillan), contains every form of help that 
the student can ask for. For a first reading it does. 
Reference is made at every point in the body of the 
work to the clause or clauses of the " Poetics " which 
are there touched upon. It is not made easy, however, 
for one who starts from the " Poetics " to refer to Pro- 
fessor Butcher's discussions. I have spent several hours 
in putting into my copy, against each clause in the trans- 
lation of the " Poetics," references to those pages in the 
following part of the book where that clause is inter- 
preted or enforced. Now I can start with Aristotle and 
refer to Professor Butcher, instead of the reverse. 

Professor Gummere's " Old English Ballads," in the 
"Athenaeum Press Series" (Ginn & Co.), has received 
the abundant praise that it deserves; but use reveals one 
decided mechanical defect. The part of the book con- 
taining the poems themselves has a running-head " Bal- 
lads "; on the right-hand page this should be replaced 
by the title of the particular ballad of which a part is 
there given. The " Notes " in a later division of the 
book have nothing to enable one to bring the two parts 
of the book into comparison without loss of time. The 
heading of p. 315, for example, might well read : " Notes : 
pp. 3-13." I would suggest, also, that in all such books 
the title of a new poem or selection in the body of the 
work have printed after it as an " exponent " the num- 
ber of the page where the notes upon that selection are 
given. For example, the ballad beginning on p. 241 in 
Professor Gummere's book would be headed " Child 
Waters 35 ^." Very many books for the study of En- 
glish literature have the defect of which I am now 
complaining. One is compelled to lose much time in 
bringing together any particular portion of the text and 
the notes thereupon. 

Other details of book-making I must leave unnoticed, 
such as tables of contents, side-heads, bibliographies, 
etc. Let me, however, make one general remark. Book- 
makers may be divided roughly into two classes. The 
authors and publishers of one class ask: "What is the 
smallest possible amount of attention which I can be- 
stow upon a table of contents, index, and similar details, 
without hindering the sale of my work or calling down 
upon myself the castigation of reviewers ? " Each mem- 
ber of the other class asks : " In how many ways can I 
make my book helpful and usable ? " Here 's to the 
health of all members of this latter class; may they live 
long and prosper! And may their tribe increase!

MARY ANDERSON'S MEMORIES.* 

In the brief proem to her pleasant Memoir 
Mme. Navarro states that she has written 
mainly for the behoof of young girls " who may 
have the same ambitions that I had ... to 
show them that the glitter of the stage is not 
all gold, and thus to do a little towards mak- 
ing them realize how serious an undertaking 
it is to adopt a life so full of hardships, humil- 
iations, and even dangers." We feel bound to 
say that Mme. Navarro's book, which is largely 
the record of her brilliant, if measurably hard- 
won, professional triumphs, strikes us as un- 
likely to exert the deterrent effect she seems to 
propose ; and that the tale of the barn-storming 
disasters of some effectually crushed tragedian 
would have been more to the purpose. In fact, 
it would be rather difficult to point to a book 
less likely to act as a wet blanket on budding 
histrionic ambitions than this one of Mme. 
Navarro's as may be gathered from our brief 
resume of her sprightly pages. 

Mary Anderson (to use the more familiar 
name) was born at Sacramento, Cal., July 28, 
1859. Her family removed thence to Louis- 
ville in 1860, where her mother, becoming a 
widow in 1863, was married to Dr. Hamilton 
Griffin five years later. Miss Anderson's first 
play was " Richard III.," with Edwin Adams 
in the title role. Shortly afterwards she saw 
Edwin Booth as Richelieu ; and it was his mas- 
terly performance that fairly fired her dawning 
passion for the stage. 

" After that brilliant performance sleep was impos- 
sible. On returning home I sat at the window of my 
little room until morning. The night passed like an 
hour. Before the dawn I had mapped out a stage ca- 
reer for myself." 

Her path once chosen, Miss Anderson threw 
herself into it with the zeal that augurs suc- 
cess. A sound-proof study secure from un- 
welcome espials, and furnished with a table 
and chair, a crucifix, a bust of Shakespeare, a 
portrait of Booth, a pair of foils, a few books 
" cribbed " from the shelves of the unsuspecting 
Dr. Griffin, and the like modest " properties " 
was fitted up at the top of the house ; and 
here the future admired Juliet and Parthenia 
took her first arduous steps stageward. The 
consciousness of improvement brought with it 
the desire of approval. Miss Anderson's first

" audience " was a little mulatto maid-of -all- 
work ; and it was from this artless critic that she 
first learned the sweets of unstinted applause. 
" One night in desperation I went to her while she 
was washing dishes in the kitchen. . . . The clapping 
of those soapy, steaming hands seemed to me a verit- 
able triumph. Believing that a tragic manner alone 
would sufficiently impress the nut-brown maid,' I be- 
gan with hollow voice and furrowed brow, ' Juli, wilt 
thou follow and assist me when I quit my childhood's 
home to walk in the path of Siddons, Kemble, and 
Booth ? ' ' Oh, Miss Mamie, you kin count on dis pus- 
son, fo' de Lawd you kin ! Why, my stars, what a boss 
actor you is ! But you mus' 'low me to call your maw '; 
and in a trice she was gone. . . . She, in turn, called 
the critic of the family, Dr. Griffin, who likewise was 
astonished, and made my heart beat with joy by saying, 
You '11 make a good actress some day. Your scene has 
thrilled me, and I would rather have rough work and a 
good thrill than any amount of artistic work without it.' " 

Thenceforth, Dr. Griffin (highly appreciating 
his " good thrill " on this occasion) became his 
step -daughter's stanchest abettor. Through 
him interviews were obtained with Miss Gush- 
man (who predicted " a future " for the novice), 
and with John McCullough who hated stage- 
struck people, and said so. " Genial John," 
however, soon thawed before his young visitor's 
enthusiasm and manifest talent ; and before 
leaving the city he said emphatically to Mr. 
Macauley, the veteran Louisville manager : 
" Barney, when you can, put this girl on the 
stage. If I am a judge of such matters, she 
will make a fortune for you." 

Miss Anderson made her debut, as Juliet, at 
Macauley's Theatre, Nov. 25, 1875. The ar- 
rangements were hurriedly made, and there was 
but one rehearsal. This rehearsal proved a sore 
trial to her, for the members of the company 
were most unkind to the raw-looking tyro who 
was assigned to the leading role. When she 
appeared, all stared, some tittered, others whis- 
pered audible and unflattering " asides." Says 
Miss Anderson : 

" Scarcely sixteen, my hair in a long braid, my frock 
reaching to my boot-tops, tall, shy, and awkward, I may 
have given them cause for merriment; but it was as 
cruel, I thought, as underbred, to make no effort to con- 
ceal their mirth at my expense." 

But the night's performance was a pronounced 
success. The kindly indulgence with which the 
lighter opening scenes were received by the 
audience warmed into genuine enthusiasm when 
the tragic parts were reached ; and flowers and 
recalls were the order of the evening. The 
young debutante was led before the curtain 
after every act, amid such rounds of applause 
as had seldom shaken the walls of the old Louis- 
ville play-house. 



Miss Anderson subsequently filled engage- 
ments at St. Louis, New Orleans, San Fran- 
cisco, and other Southern and Western cities, 
when, her fame spreading, attractive offers 
from Eastern managers tempted her to try her 
fortune before the more critical audiences of 
Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Here 
again success crowned her efforts despite 
some rather cavalier treatment at the hands of 
the discriminating critics of the daily papers. 
In 1878 she went abroad for the first time. At 
Paris many charming and profitable evenings 
were spent at the Comedie Franchise although 
Miss Anderson admits that the exquisite re- 
finement and finesse of the French stage were 
at first lost upon her, the nice tints and touches 
by which such actors as Mme. Bernhardt, Got, 
Worms, and Mounet Sully obtained their effects 
appearing weak and insipid. " I longed," she 
says, " for the artists to fling their restraints 
to the winds and give the public a good old- 
fashioned burst in the tragic scenes, such as I 
had been accustomed to see and indulge in my- 
self." On orie occasion, however, it seems Mme. 
Bernhardt gratified her with " a good old- 
fashioned burst" in a style that must have 
brought the " gods " even of old " Macauley's " 
to their feet. Madame, she says, had a way of 
turning her back upon the audience to make 
comic remarks or grimaces for the benefit of 
her friends in the wings ; and it was quite im- 
possible to realize her tragic power when she 
constantly distracted one with droll " asides." 
But one evening she said to Miss Anderson, " I 
will act for you to-night. It is not good for 
me, but you shall see." 

" After the first acts a series of triumphs she came 
to the death scene. I shall always remember it as the 
most powerfully realistic acting I have ever witnessed. 
When it was over, there was wild enthusiasm in the 
house. The great actress lay upon the stage like one 
really dead. Her maids ran to her assistance. There 
was a stain of blood upon the handkerchief put to her 
lips. A little iced champagne restored her, though she 
was only able to stand quite still, while the audience 
thundered its applause. She put her hand on my shoul- 
der on coming off the stage, and, with a faint smile, 
simply said Voila ! ' ' 

Miss Anderson made her London debut in 
1883, at the Lyceum. Parthenia was the role 
chosen for the opening night, as being the sim- 
plest one in her repertory, and one in which 
comparison with leading English favorites 
would not be challenged. The choice proved a 
wise one, though managers and critics advised 
against it, believing that the old-fashioned sen- 
timent and stilted phrase of the play would pro- 
voke the mirth of a Hn-de-siecle audience. A

full house greeted the young American actress, 
and the applause on her first entrance was long 
and hearty. 

" The excitement of the first scenes had evidently 
weakened me, for in the second act, while weaving gar- 
lands for the golden cups, a kindly voice from the pit 
called out: 'Mary, please speak up a bit! ' This was 
said with such good feeling that it put an end to my 
nervousness, and from that moment the play ran 
smoothly to the end. . . . Among the many who came 
behind the scenes to offer their congratulations was Mr. 
P. T. Barnum, who exclaimed, in his own hearty way, 
Hurrah for America! You 've won London, or I know 
nothing of public taste! ' " 

That Miss Anderson had indeed won London 
was clearly demonstrated on the night of her 
farewell performance there. Mr. Alma-Tad- 
ema, the distinguished painter, has eloquently 
described the scene, in a letter to the heroine of 
the evening : 

". . . The house called for a speech, and it did one 
good to see everybody so grateful for what you had 
given, and I shall never forget the moment when, after 
a few words of farewell, you hesitated, and tried to find 
a support on the curtain, when a voice from the gallery 
was heard saying, God bless you, Mary! ' and immedi- 
ately the hearty wish was reechoed by the whole theatre 
as if with one voice. Alas! you did not keep your prom- 
ise, and never returned to the London stage, and reserved 
only to some chosen friends the happiness of meeting 
you, who must always be a bright star in their past." 

But Miss Anderson's reception at London, 
kindly as it was, was nothing to that at Dublin, 
where the warm-hearted Irishmen, not content 
with making the theatre a sort of cheerful pan- 
demonium during each evening's performance, 
took the horses from her carriage every night 
after the play and dragged it through the streets 
in triumph. Of one night in particular she 
says, " I doubt if, outside of Dublin, any landau 
ever held so many shrieking enthusiasts." 

" The driver's box occupied by three or four of them, 
one on each of the carriage steps, dozens pushing it from 
behind, dozens pulling it in front, the top literally 
swarming with them; while from the crowd that rushed 
after our strange-looking vehicle came deafening cries 
of ' Hurrah for America ! ' ' The Sthars and Sthroipes 
for iver ! ' God Bless our Mary ! ' while Mary sat inside, 
fearfully listening to every creak of the roof, and ex- 
pecting it each moment to fall in with its kind-hearted 
though heavy-weighted devotees." 

On the final night's journey to Queenstown, 
where Miss Anderson was to take ship for 
America, she was awakened from time to time 
by unaccountable cheers and cries of " Hurrah 
for the Stars and Stripes ! " " Good luck to our 
Mary ! " etc.; and was at last told that a detach- 
ment of that night's audience had boarded the 
train, and were seeing her safely on her way 
to the sea. It is pleasant to record these well- 
earned triumphs of our gifted countrywoman. 



Miss Anderson made her final appearance 
on the stage at Washington in 1889. Shortly 
afterward she became engaged to Antonio F. 
de Navarro, whom she had known for many 
years ; and in June, 1890, they were married 
at the little Catholic church at Hampstead, Lon- 
don. Many and great inducements, she says, 
" have since been offered me to act again, but 

' II en coute trap cher pour briller dans le monde, 

Combien je vais aimer ma retraite profonde ; 

Pour vivre heureuz, vivons caches.' " 

Miss Anderson's book is easily and pleas- 
antly, if perhaps rather hurriedly, written. It 
contains many anecdotes of notable people 
Generals Grant and Sherman, Longfellow, 
Lowell, Tennyson, Cardinal Manning, Mr. 
Gladstone, WUkie Collins, and so on besides 
a fund of good stories drawn from the author's 
professional experiences. Perhaps the best part 
of it is the wholesome impression it conveys of 
the character of the writer for it is needless 
to say that in Miss Anderson the stage lost not 
only a gifted artist but a most estimable wo- 
man. The generous plaudits that followed her 
career were paid no less to the one than to the 
other ; and her name is enrolled with those of 
the many true men and pure women who have 
graced and dignified the player's once con- 
temned calling. We may note, in closing, that 
Miss Anderson's stern insistence on the pro- 
prieties became a sort of half-humorous by- 
word in the profession, the witty Mr. W. S. 
Gilbert once affirming that such was her horror 
of grossness in all its forms that she could 
scarcely be persuaded to touch her share of the 
gross receipts. j;. G. J.

after much experimental writing, to practise a 
correct method of unfolding our national his- 
tory. The history of the United States has 
hitherto seemed to a large extent to evade, in 
treatment, the introduction of any unity into 
the narrative, or the discovery of any unity in 
the substance. Men have gone on writing gen- 
eral histories, and, surveying the ill-assorted 
material from above, have failed to grasp into 
one the apparently incoherent local diversities. 
Even Bancroft, over-possessed by the cult of 
ancestor-worship, could not find in such pre-

suppositions any adequate principle of construc- 
tion. Hildreth the iconoclast did no better in 
this respect, although he cleared the atmos- 
phere of cant and of rhetoric. A few years ago 
the Johns Hopkins historical school began to 
make us see that the biological method is the 
true one, and that the beginnings of national 
life must be traced upward from the subter- 
ranean rootlets of the days of the founders into 
that difficult specimen of the composite which 
covers a continent and fills the heavens. We 
now realize that the processes which made the 
thirteen colonies have gone on making new local 
centres in the ever-enlarging West, and that a 
true method of investigation will work upward 
from the local centres of life and of institutions 
to the evolving unit toward which they all con- 
tribute. American national history cannot be 
finally written until the field of the local life be 
thoroughly investigated and the material clas- 
sified. 

A portion of our oldest local area has been 
thoroughly covered in a book recently issued, 
" The Economic History of Virginia in the 
Seventeenth Century," by Mr. Philip A. Bruce, 
and the limited field selected has been so search- 
ingly explored that it is safe to say the work has 
been done once for all. Mr. Bruce, as secre- 
tary of the Virginia Historical Society, has had 
familiar access to a wealth of materials, which 
he has handled in a most scholarly and critical 
way. The mass of material available is so great 
that the author's original intention of writing 
Virginia's economic history to the time of the 
Civil War was abandoned. Other abstinences 
are not so pardonable, but are due to too rigid 
an adherence to a table of categories. In the 
preface we are told that the general subject of 
Virginian history, apart from the course of 
events, falls under the following heads : Eco- 
nomic Condition, Social Life, Religious Estab- 
lishment and Moral Influences, Education, Mil- 
itary Regulations, Administration of Justice, 
Political System. Confining his investigations 
to the economic condition alone, the writer has 
sacrificed unity to system. He says : 

" No references have been made to printing in Vir- 
ginia in the seventeenth century, and the degree to which 
books entered into the inventories of the planters' es- 
tates, because such references, it appeared, would more 
properly come under the head of Education. For the 
same reason, the question as to how far bricks were 
employed in the construction of church edifices in that 
age has not been touched upon at length in the descrip- 
tion of the use of this material in houses, because it 
seemed to be more consistent to include it under the 
head of the Religious Establishment. For the same rea- 



son, also, the scope of taxation and the powers of the 
vestries have only been dwelt upon incidentally to facts 
relating directly to the economic condition of the peo- 
ple. A full account of both would with more fitness be 
given under the head of the political system." 

It may be questioned whether this mechan- 
ical partitioning of the field of history would 
allow of good results even if one assumed that 
all the six other departments made by Mr. 
Bruce are to be presented to us with the same 
thoroughness which his section has enjoyed. 
But, as it is, one misses from these volumes just 
such material as has been omitted purposely. 
Some explanation of the parish system and of 
the methods of taxation are essential, even in 
an economic history, to an intelligent compre- 
hension of the subject by anyone who is not a 
historical scholar. While thus confining his 
history too rigidly to satisfy the reader, who 
will hardly live to see all the field occupied by 
as able pioneers as this one, Mr. Bruce has neg- 
lected little inside his own boundaries. " Rea- 
sons for the Colonization of Virginia " intro- 
duces us to chapters on the physical character 
and the Indian economy of the aboriginal pe- 
riod. Four chapters on agricultural develop- 
ment follow ; and another on the acquisition of 
title to land leads on to a discussion of the sys- 
tem of labor with the " servant " and the slave. 
Other chapters treat of the domestic economy 
of the planter, of the relative value of estates, 
of money, and of manufactured supplies, and a 
final chapter is given to the town. The recog- 
nition of Captain John Smith, as " the real 
founder of Virginia, the one man who early rec- 
ognized, and who labored hard while in power 
to carry out, the true principles of action which 
should have been followed by the small band 
of colonists planted on the Powhatan," is given 
with no uncertain sound, and is refreshing after 
so much that has been written in disparage- 
ment of that truly great man. It is shown that 
Smith was not the only farsighted and wise 
man in the colony whose admirable counsels 
were overruled by the shortsighted desire of the 
managers in England for an immediate return 
on investments. Gates must share with Smith 
in the credit for statesmanlike breadth and 
prevision. Such men as these opposed as mo- 
tives of the original adventure the search for 
the precious metals and for a way to the South 
Sea, and laid emphasis on the other reasons 
which the writer so admirably sets forth new 
sources of raw materials for the industrial life 
of England, new markets for English goods, 
new fields for the growing population of the

mother land, and new political barriers against 
the formidable power of Spain all of which 
were justified in the event. Every chapter is 
packed with details of the immediate subject in 
hand, but those which make the most distinct 
contribution to historical literature discuss the 
servant, land tenure, and agriculture. The 
peculiar institution of the servant is handled 
with accuracy and discernment, although the 
atmosphere is too much that of condonation of 
an essentially vicious system as bad if not 
worse than that of slavery. Yet the writer is 
to be thanked for his successful vindication of 
this unfortunate class from the foul aspersions 
upon them that have become historic in a 
famous retort of Ben Butler. Many of these 
so-called criminals were political offenders in a 
time of civil war, and many others were the 
victims of the kidnapper. It is maintained, 
with much force, that in the beginning the cul- 
ture of tobacco was an economic necessity, and 
in no small degree continued to be such. Yet 
of this culture the system of large estates was 
a result, and not as is commonly supposed of 
the existence of slavery. This manorial sys- 
tem, which made a land of no cities and of few 
towns, produced that political result which so 
largely differentiated Virginia from New En- 
gland, and yet which made her the " mother of 
statesmen." 

It would take much more space than we can 
command to expatiate upon the merits of these 
volumes. A few shortcomings may be noted. 
One would not infer from Mr. Bruce's allusion 
to the Roanoke Island colonists that he had 
read Professor Weeks' able paper on that sub- 
ject, published by the Historical Association. 
It is not accurate to speak of an emperor at 
Moscow in the sixteenth century. One would 
naturally infer from the statement on page 41 
of Volume I. that McClure sailed around the 
northern end of the American continent in 
1852. When reading of the controversy in the 
Stuart days over the importation of Virginia 
tobacco, one turns in vain to the bibliography 
for a reference to Hall's " Customs-Revenue of 
England "; a reference needed, if only to cor- 
rect some of the errors of temper as well as of 
statement of that somewhat bilious writer. It 
would be difficult to say what is the thought in 
the sentence beginning at the bottom of page 
75 in the first volume. The same may be said 
of the sentence at the bottom of page 314. On 
page 90, again, we are told of " planks twenty 
yards in length and two and a half feet square." 
On page 158 of the second volume the shingle 



used is described as " a square oblong piece of 
cypress or pine wood." But these are mere 
specks on the sun, and do not impair the value 
of a book which is a marvel of minute detail 
and of critical fairness of judgment.

THE FAR EASTERN QTJESTIOX.* 

Premier Bourgeois recently declared that if 
the Chinese administration was reorganized 
by Europeans his Government would see that 
France got her share of the offices. This is a 
refreshing manifestation of the feeling in the 
Cabinets of Europe, a spiritual inheritance 
from Alexander VI., perhaps, that all outer- 
barbarians may most suitably be used to com- 
plete some list of colonial possessions. It also 
suggests that since the war between China and 
Japan, Russian, French, and English states- 
men have another " Sick Man " on their hands, 
not in extremis, as that expensive patient at 
Constantinople appeared to be some months 
ago, but certainly sick enough to lead them to 
consider the best means of getting their just 
portion of the estate. And so it happens that 
there is a Far Eastern Question, not less puz- 
zling in its possibilities than the ever unan- 
swered Eastern Question. 

The volume in which Mr. Valentine Chirol 
discusses this new situation is unusually enlight- 
ening. Unlike an anonymous writer in a re- 
cent number of the " Fortnightly Review," he 
thinks Lord Rosebery may have been right in 
refusing to join Russia in the protest against 
the permanent Japanese occupation of the pen- 
insula of Liao-tung provided for by the treaty 
of Shimonoseki. Japan's friendship, deserved 
by this refusal, may be more valuable in the 
immediate future than the dubious gratitude of 
China which the opposite policy would have 
called forth. Nevertheless, Mr. Chirol does not 
fail to recognize the substantial gains in control 
over the Peking authorities Russia and France 
won by taking skilful advantage of the position 
their successful intervention assured them. 

The old policy of England in the Far East 
rested on the doctrine that there was immense 
latent power in the Chinese Empire ; but the 
war has so effectually disposed of this venera- 
ble tradition that the confidence with which it

was announced up to within the past few months 
seems now almost incredible. The country has 
great natural resources, doubtless, and the peo- 
ple are industrious, and yet these advantages 
are neutralized by a thoroughly corrupt admin- 
istrative system. Says Mr. Chirol, in giving 
his impressions after a visit there : 

" Nowhere in Peking could the faintest indication be 
detected of a desire to apply, or even of a capacity to 
understand, the lessons of the recent war. A more hope- 
less spectacle of fatuous imbecility, made up in equal 
parts of arrogance and helplessness, than the Central 
Government of the Chinese Empire presented after the 
actual pressure of war had been removed it is almost 
impossible to conceive." 

Mr. Chirol seems to have had remarkable 
opportunities of forming an intelligent opinion, 
especially through an inter view with the Tsungli- 
Yamen, or board of Foreign Eelations, and dur- 
ing a call upon Li Hung Chang at Tientsin on 
his return from Peking. Li Hung Chang 
asked him why he had remained so much longer 
than he had intended in the Chinese capital. 

" I replied that I had been looking for some sign of 
the awakening of China. ' I hope,' rejoined the Viceroy 
with a grim smile, that your time has not been wasted.' 
In one sense certainly, as I assured his Excellency, my 
time had not been wasted, for I had at least satisfied 
myself that the search upon which I had been engaged 
was a futile one." 

If such be the condition of the Chinese Em- 
pire, the judicious use of pressure exercised 
through the channels of diplomacy, but made 
effective by suggestive displays of military and 
naval power, is the secret of successful negotia- 
tion with the Son of Heaven. Eussia and France 
understood this perfectly, and for the last year 
they have been browbeating China into one 
concession after another, the details of which 
are not yet fully known in Western Europe. 
But they were anxious first to rid themselves 
of their German ally, of whom they had no 
further need after the Japanese had yielded. 
Accordingly, the Eussian and French ministers 
suddenly discovered that they had letters giv- 
ing official notification of the accession of Nich- 
olas II. and the election of President Faure, 
which they had not delivered because of the war. 

" With a curious affectation of impossible secrecy an 
audience was arranged, to which the Russian and French 
ministers proceeded in great state. There they received, 
according to their own account, in terms of unprece- 
dented cordiality, the solemn thanks of the Son of 
Heaven himself for the great services rendered to him 
by their respective Governments. This was the first 
public intimation conveyed to Germany that her com- 
pany was no longer required or desired." 

France then, June 20, under threats, compelled 
the President of the Tsungli-Yamen to sign a 



convention giving to her territory in the south 
which England ceded to China a little over a 
year ago on the understanding that it would 
not be transferred to any other Power without 
England's consent. Next, Eussia and France 
together forced upon China a Franco-Eussian 
loan toward which proposals from either Brit- 
ish or German financiers were not to be re- 
ceived. But for a crisis in the Paris money 
market, this scheme to make China financially 
dependent on the two Powers might have suc- 
ceeded. Paris, however, has been unable to 
furnish all the money needed to cover the war 
indemnity. Consequently, within the last few 
weeks, as Mr. Chirol foresaw, an Anglo-Ger- 
man loan of .16,000,000 has been negotiated. 
This event leaves the triumph of France and 
Eussia impaired, especially as England will 
probably never permit the June convention to 
be carried out, because it would more firmly 
fix the hold of the French on the upper Mekong 
and would still further threaten English con- 
trol of the Yang-tsze-Kiang valley. Mean- 
while, the Western world is filled with rumors 
of extraordinary privileges granted Eussia in 
the North, rights of way for the Trans-Siberian 
railroad, ice-free ports for the navy, and the like. 

In view of the trade the British have built up 
in the Far East, this new turn of affairs must 
seem ominous to Englishmen. It is an open 
question, therefore, in spite of what Mr. Chirol 
says, if it would not have been wiser for En- 
gland to have accepted Eussia's invitation, 
extended to her before it was sent to France 
and Germany, and to have arranged for joint 
diplomatic action against Japan's proposed 
seizure of Leao-tong, since an agreement at this 
point might have opened the way for a friendly 
settlement of all outstanding questions between 
Eussia and England. Moreover, had England 
met Eussia's views in Eastern Asia, perhaps 
the attempt to intervene in Armenia would not 
have proved such a discreditable failure. 

Mr. Chirol's book throws considerable light 
also on the industrial situation. From his study 
of the rapid economic development of Japan, 
he believes the Japanese will soon be England's 
most dangerous competitors in the Chinese mar- 
ket. His remarks carry the suggestion that the 
two island empires may not always be friendly. 

Mr. Chirol's analysis of the situation in the 
Far East is supported by the opinions of the 
Eight Hon. George N. Curzon, Under-Secretary 
of State in the Salisbury Cabinet, expressed in 
the revised edition, just published, of his "Prob- 
lems of the Far East." One glances over Mr.

Curzon's pages with more than ordinary curi- 
osity because his present position in the For- 
eign Office might give his book a quite unusual 
authority, but the new preface intimates with 
disappointing clearness that he has drawn solely 
from the deep well of his own private wisdom. 

Mr. Curzon has certainly had the good for- 
tune, rare among seers, of reprinting verbatim 
et literatim, to the confusion of skeptical critics, 
prophecies made in the first edition of his book 
just before the war. For example, he wrote 
then and repeats now, " The Chinese army, 
under Chinese officers, even with muskets in 
its hands and cartridges in its pouches, is an 
undisciplined rabble of tramps." The chief 
value of this edition, besides being an exhibit 
of prophecy fulfilled, consists in the chapter on 
" After the War," and particularly in that por- 
tion of the chapter which gives the story of 
Japan's efforts to force reform in Korea from 
1894 to the close of the summer of 1895. This 
story presents a side of the recent conflict in 
the East which reflects no especial credit upon 
the good sense of Japanese statesmen. The 
utter failure of the plan and the general conse- 
quences of the war have changed Korea, says 
Mr. Curzon, into the powder magazine of the 
East. He predicts that we shall hear of this 
" last of the nations and most miserable of peo- 
ples " again before long ; and since he wrote 
Korea has furnished the spectacle of another 
palace revolution, with Russia and not Japan as 
the solicitous friend. 

The importance of Mr. Curzon's utterances 
would have been increased had they been writ- 
ten with the Mekong Settlement before him 
and the rumors of Russian aggression sound- 
ing in his ears, but even though they antedate 
the latest turns of the kaleidoscope, one or two 
gain a special interest from his present respon- 
sibilities. In explaining the attitude of Great 
Britain toward Russian advance he points out 
the dangers to British shipping in the Yellow 
Sea from a Russian port and fleet in the Gulf 
of Fe-chi-li, and says that Russian squadrons, 
with permanent quarters at Port Lazareff and 
Fusan on the eastern coast of Korea, would 
seriously jeopardize, if not absolutely overturn, 
the balance of power in the Far East, and adds 
that to such an issue " England is prohibited 
alike by her imperial objects and her commer- 
cial needs from lending her sanction." Al- 
though, like Mr. Chirol, Mr. Curzon says China 
" appears to have learned nothing, and, what 
is worse, to have unlearned nothing from the 
war," he differs from Mr. Chirol in feeling, if 



not thinking, that China may yet turn to Great 
Britain for support, because Great Britain has 
shown herself more disinterested than the 
others. He obviously does not relish the policy 
of intimate relations with the bumptious Jap- 
anese, who, moreover, he also believes are des- 
tined soon to make serious inroads on British 
trade in China. 

Mr. Curzon prints as appendices the Revis- 
ion Treaty between Great Britain and Japan, 
giving the Japanese their long-desired judicial 
autonomy, and the Treaty of Peace between 
China and Japan, signed at Shimonoseki.

BETTERS AND VERSES OF DEAN STANLEY.* 

The editor of the recently issued " Letters 
and Verses of Stanley " has erred, if at all, in 
rejecting too scrupulously those letters which 
reveal the personal life of the great liberal min- 
ister and scholar. Yet this fault is much rather 
to be pardoned than the opposite one which pa- 
rades the sacred privacy of a great man's heart 
and hearth before the wanton curiosity of an 
alien public. One must feel on reading the 
Letters that we have in the volume all that a 
typical Englishman like Dean Stanley, guard- 
ing his house as his castle, would willingly con- 
cede even to his admirers ; in a word, that the 
Editor has met the first requirement of an ed- 
itor of private correspondence, and treated it 
in accordance with the probable wishes of the 
writer of the letters. The result for the read- 
ing public is quite distinct : a certain revela- 
tion of Dean Stanley's tastes and opinions, 
though little that is new ; some additional con- 
tribution to the picture of Thomas Arnold 
letters that would find appropriate place in a 
supplement to Stanley's "Life of Arnold"; 
considerable material supplementary to his 
"Sinai and Palestine"; and so on with his 
other books ; finally a few interesting letters 
from Jowett, several letters by Stanley from 
America, and his verses. 

There is nothing in these letters to alter the 
opinion which prevails of Dean Stanley as an 
eminently wholesome, cheerful Englishman, 
who spent not overmuch time worrying as to 
the scheme of the universe and his position in 
it, but took things as he found them, lived 
cleanly and loftily, and did conscientiously what

he found to do. That he was not, at least in 
his youth, so different from other men, is shown 
in his letters telling of his presenting his prize 
poem " Charles Martel " before the school at 
Rugby. He writes to his sister Mary : 

" I have been pondering a new coat, but I have at 
last come to the conclusion that the one I had at the 
ball will do. The only objection is that when, in speak- 
ing the English verse, I stretch forth my hand in action, 
the sleeves, being rather short, come down; but I can 
remedy that by a long shirt sleeve, and perhaps my 
forefinger turned down upon the rebellious coat-sleeve." 

Doubtless the absence of letters describing 
spiritual wrestlings is not proof conclusive that 
the young man had none, yet the editor would 
probably not have withheld such. And the at- 
titude of the man's mind seems frankly ex- 
pressed in these extracts : 

" I know of no system to which I can hold except 
Arnold's. I feel that to become a Newrnanist would 
be a shock to my whole existence, that it would subvert 
every relation of life in which I have stood or hoped to 
stand hereafter. I dread to think of it even as a pos- 
sibility, and I dread also the possibility of a long and 
dreary halting between two opinions which will mar the 
pleasure of every opinion I hold for an indefinite period. 
With this feeling you may be sure I shall not join it 
without a desperate fight within and without, that I will 
leave no stone unturned which may enable me to keep in 
that line of life to which I had thought God had called me, 
and from which a conversion to Newmanism would lead 
me away into a path utterly unknown to me" (Feb., 1838). 

" I received a letter from Arnold which added what- 
ever could be added to the solemnity of the ordination 
[his own], and softened whatever could be softened of 
the bitterness of subscription." 

" The real thing which long ago moved me to wish 
to go into orders, and which, had I not gone into or- 
ders I should have acted upon as well as I could with- 
out orders, was the fact that God seemed to have given 
me gifts more fitting me for orders, and for that partic- 
ular line of clerical duty which I have chosen, than for 
any other " (Feb., 1840). 

One of the most beautiful things about Stan- 
ley was his devotion to Arnold. His " Life 
and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold" is 
inspired by the very spirit of Arnold, and will 
remain the best of his published works. But 
a more touching memorial of this love " pass- 
ing the love of woman " is the annual letter to 
Mrs. Arnold or her children on the anniversary 
of Arnold's death, with its ever renewed testi- 
mony to the immortality of the inspiration of 
the great Rugby Master's life and teaching. 
" Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again," so, but 
with less sadness, rings the keynote of the se- 
ries from 1847 to 1880 when the last was writ- 
ten to " My Dear Fan," Mrs. Arnold having 
died several years before. 

" I anticipate by one day the letter which I always 
wrote to your dear mother at this time, that you may 



get it in the midst of dear Matthew's home. I am going 
to give an address to a school on your father, and I 
shall make it, as at Rugby, on the two words whose 
meaning and hope Matthew told me that we had both 
learned from the same source Religion and History. 
. . . How I seem to see him towering above the rest of 
the world, amidst all the changes that have happened 
since! How I trust to what he taught us and what he 
showed us! ... We are on a little island of memory, 
and all who share in that memory must hold together as 
long as life lasts." 

Whether Stanley wrote the anniversary letter 
for the next year does not appear, and he died 
a month after it was due, July 18, 1881. 

Americans will of course be interested in the 
letters from America. On the voyage the Dean 
coached for the approaching contact with the 
new country, as indicated in the following : " I 
can now repeat the names of all the Presidents, 
and explain the meaning of Democrat and 
Republican. Democrat is Liberal, and Repub- 
lican is Conservative." Like all foreigners he 
was looking for something that would " smack 
of the soil," and found it in a wild Westerner 
who said, "I was that sick that I almost brought 
up my knee-pans "; as well as in a choice col- 
lection of Americanisms more or less recogniz- 
able. He attended the two hundred and fiftieth 
anniversary of the founding of Salem and heard 
Story's poem. " I thought it quite magnifi- 
cent in its tone. It denounced the follies and 
corruptions of the United States with a vigor 
which I should have thought quite impossible 
to have been attempted." The society of Bos- 
ton struck him as very like that of Geneva, 
" the most civilized in Europe the same uni- 
form amount of intelligence and cultivation in 
all the families all well-conditioned, and all 
intermarried with each other." 

The editor has modestly chosen the designa- 
tion " Verses " for Dean Stanley's few rhymed 
effusions. The student of literature may find 
room for interesting reflections in the fact that 
the man who wrote the prize poem at Rugby in 
1832, and again at Oxford in 1837, was so lack- 
ing in the divine afflatus as these verses show. 
Stanley as a poet tempts to a comparison with 
Luther, for while he has a few pieces in lighter 
vein, as " The Bear of Bludan," and the valen- 
tine to Mrs. Grote, his best work, indeed his 
only work worth considering, is his hymns. 
These treat the same themes as Luther's hymns, 
and are in much the same spirit and quality of 
workmanship. There is a version of the Dies 
Jrce in six-line stanzas, closely resembling the 
translations of Walter Scott and Macaulay. 
Resemblance to some version of this much- 
translated hymn was of course inevitable.

Among the best of the pieces in this line are 
those beginning : " When the Pascal evening 
fell," " Let us with a gladsome mind," and es- 
pecially "Where is the Christian's fatherland?" 
Of this last, imitated from Arndt's famous 
poem " What is the German's fatherland ? " 
the last stanza runs : 

" Thy native home is wheresoe'er 
Christ's spirit breathes a holier air ; 
Where Christ-like Faith is keen to seek 
What Truth or Conscience freely speak 
Where Christ-like love is keen to span 
The rents that sever man from man 
Where round God's throne His just ones stand 
There, Christian, is thy Fatherland." 

It is strange, by the way, that there is such 
absolute absence of any influence of Tennyson 
on Stanley's poetic taste. Indeed, Tennyson, 
Dickens, Thackeray, seem not to have been 
within his horizon. w. H. CARRUTH. 



TRIBAL, SOCIETY AS ILLUSTRATED 
IN WALES.* 

Twelve years ago Mr. Seebohm put forth 
" The English Village Community," the sixth 
chapter of which dealt with the tribal system 
in Wales. His latest work, " The Tribal Sys- 
tem in Wales," is an expansion of that chap- 
ter. In method of treatment it differs greatly 
from its predecessor. That was a comparative 
study English, Welsh, Irish, and ancient 
Roman institutions all coming within the pur- 
view of the author. This, in the author's words, 
is " confined to an attempt to understand the 
structure of tribal society in Wales. The meth- 
ods of tribal society in Wales and the extension 
of the inquiry to other tribal systems are left to 
form the subject of another volume " (p. v.). 
This purpose is rigidly adhered to, and no- 
where do we find a suggestion of that contro- 
versial spirit displayed in " The English Vil- 
lage Community." But though maintaining this 
position of neutrality with respect to the evi- 
dence he adduces, Mr. Seebohm's end in view 
is none the less evident. Throughout the en- 
tire work, influences in accord with Mr. See- 
bohm's well-known opinions irresistibly force 
themselves upon us. We find no ideas advanced 
to bias the judgment simply a statement of 
facts ; but these facts are so artfully mustered 
and massed that the continuity of argument, 
even if only suggested, and that ever so faintly, 
is complete, and in the end appeals with aston- 
ishing power. 

* THE TKIEAL SYSTEM IN WALES. Being part of an inquiry 
into the structure and methods of Tribal Society. By Sir 
Frederic Seebohm. New York : Longmans, Green, &.Co. 



The documentary sources upon which Mr. 
Seebohm has based his study consist of the 
Extents, Court Rolls, and Assessments of the 
Isle of Anglesey, from the year 1294 to 1352 ; 
but from these he has necessarily worked back 
to the ancient laws of Wales and ecclesias- 
tical donations of the pre-Norman era. The 
fact that Mr. Seebohm cannot read the Welsh 
language is no bar, for the documents are all 
in Latin. Curious cases are discernible in 
reading the sources, showing the difficulty Ed- 
ward's lawyers had in discovering a Latin term 
to define a purely Welsh institution (e. g., p. 3), 
precisely the same problem which faced the 
Roman historian Tacitus in describing the man- 
ners and customs of the ancient Germans. But 
Mr. Seebohm's hours of study have not been 
confined merely to the alcoves of the Record 
Office, or the MS. department of the British 
Museum. As a member of the Royal Commis- 
sion to investigate the Welsh land-system, he 
has actually traversed the entire land of which 
he writes. The basis of " The Tribal System 
in Wales," however, is the documents pertain- 
ing to the so-called " manors " of Aberffraw and 
Denbigh, upon the Isle of Anglesey. The reason 
for so doing is that here, more than anywhere 
else in Wales, Welsh tribal customs are likely 
to be seen in their purity. The tenacity of the 
Welsh tribal system is astonishing, for its inte- 
gral structure survived " the wreckful siege of 
battering days," the conquests of Henry II. 
and Edward I., plague and famine, and as one 
has finely said, " the slow assay of time until 
the final institution of the English law under 
Henry VIII." 

The " manor " of Aberffraw is shown to have 
consisted of demesne land held by free tenants 
who occupied weles or gwelys, while the unfree 
villani occupied outlying hamlets. The ques- 
tion then arises, What was a wele ? The an- 
swer is found in the Denbigh Extent (8 Ed- 
ward III., see Appendix B), which " seems to 
be the only one which meets the requirements 
of the case. It was made before the ' Black 
Death.' It relates to a mainly pastoral dis- 
trict which continued to a large extent under 
the rules of ancient custom. It gives the name 
of every tenant, and has, moreover, distinct 
reference to a condition of things both before 
and after the conquest of North Wales " (p. 30). 
It is evident that the weles are of free tribesmen 
who are said to hold in weles and gavells, and 
further evidence shows that the wele was a fam- 
ily group including great-great-grandsons, with 
sub-divisions into gavells. Thus the Welsh 



274 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



land was occupied by so many joint-family com- 
munities embracing subordinate family groups. 
The wele is, therefore, a division of the tribe, 
not of the land, holding an undivided share in 
the occupation of a district (pp. 31-4). 

Turning from the kindred-group to the land 
it occupied, we find the lowest land unit in the 
surveys called villata. These villatce are fixed 
and permanent units, while the wele itself was 
not compact, but could enjoy separate holdings 
in several villatce, or be confined, as the case 
might be, to one villata. It is impossible, how- 
ever, to go into the details of tribal structure 
described by Mr. Seebohm : they are welcome 
additions to our knowledge of early institutions. 
The main interest lies in the fact that in this 
tribal society of Wales one sees a nucleus of 
the later manor. This is nowhere stated, but 
the inference drawn from the consideration of 
the evidence in hand is that the old English 
manor had an admixture of Welsh elements in 
it, and the corollary of this inference is that 
the English conquest of Britain was not as de- 
structive as some students would have us think. 

This interest is heightened by the fact that 
the Welsh constitution contained unmistakable 
feudal origins, and these, strange to say, are 
not so much of a political or economic charac- 
ter as military. Undoubtedly feudalism is 
neither wholly Roman nor wholly German in 
origin, but rather social and economic : given 
certain conditions and certain effects will fol- 
low, whether in France and Germany or in 
India and Japan. The Welsh chieftain called 
a uchelwr was a privileged tribesman, head of 
a wele, a landed lord, and in South Wales a 
judge also (pp. 54, 90, 93, 127). The other 
members of the wele were not joint-tenants or 
* landed ' persons, but were in a subordinate 
position and had rights of maintenance only 
(p. 91). Every innate boneddig or tribesman 
of full blood claimed his maintenance as mem- 
ber of the greater kindred-group and not by 
inheritance from his father. He ascended to 
his father's privilege as a landed person at his 
father's death, but the right of succession was 
prospective he might live and die without such 
ascent. When he did ascend to the privilege 
of his father he became a marchog or mounted 
horseman. Thus in the military constitution 
of the tribe the uchelwr is a horseman, the in- 
nate boneddig a foot-soldier (p. 91-5). The 
evolution of this feudal system Mr. Seebohm 
presents as follows : 

" Under the tribal system the wele is the unit. The 
brenhin (privileged chieftain or prince) and the mem- 



bers of his wele form the royal and ruling class. The 
breyrs or uchelwrs, heads of weles with the innate boned- 
digs under them, form the second class of free tribes- 
men. The villeins, or strangers in blood, form the third 
class; and beneath all these were the cceths or slaves, 
who could be bought and sold. 

" The extraordinary solidarity of the kindreds and the 
tribe a solidarity to which history bears ample testi- 
mony was gained at the expense of the freedom and 
equality of the individual tribesmen. And little as the 
Codes reveal to us of the actual condition of the Cym- 
ric tribesmen, it is impossible to shut our eyes to the 
easy possibility of oppression on the part of chieftains 
and uchelwrs. It is easy to see how, if such was the 
structure of the Gallic tribes described by Caesar, his 
description of tribal society might well be, in measure 
at least, typical of tribal society generally in its early 
stages. It might, under the pressure of want on the 
part of the tribesmen or the unscrupulous use of power 
on the part of the uchelwrs or higher chieftains, easily 
come to pass that the mass of tribesmen, with their bare 
rights of maintenance and a peculium subject to the 
vicissitudes of fortune, elsewhere than in the Gaul of 
Caesar's description might become almost the serfs of 
the uchelwrs, or, as he describes them, the servi of the 
equites" (p. 109). 

These feudal forms suggest a bond between 
tribal society and feudal society, and also have 
their direct bearing, as is shown (p. 130), upon 
early English institutions. If Mr. Seebohm 
had done nothing else in these pages than bring 
the light of Welsh forms to bear upon our 
knowledge of feudalism and the manorial sys- 
tem, his book would have been a notable one. 
As it is, he has advanced some other facts which 
will set the student of early English institutions 
to earnest thinking. 

For example, in the case of a criminal who 
was banished from Cymru, " it was required of 
every one of every sex and age within hearing 
of the horn to follow that exile, and to keep up 
the barking of dogs, to the time of his putting 
to sea, until he shall have passed three-score 
hours out of sight " (p. 59). This at once sug- 
gests the old English ordinance of the hundred. 
Evidently here in Wales we have the folk of a 
district responsible for oversight of a criminal. 
Few questions in English institutional history 
have so eluded settlement by sincere and pro- 
found investigators as that of the origin and 
early character of the hundred. Historians 
from Spelman down to Stubbs and Freeman 
have tried in vain and in many ways to explain 
the origin and early character of the hundred. 
Phillips, Turner, and Palgrave give up in des- 
pair. Lingard opposes the view of everybody 
else, and has none of his own. Spelman, rea- 
soning from analogy in the frank-pledge, refers 
it to a similar responsible group. So does Leo. 
Verelius and Grimm hold that the hundred 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



275 



was an area comprising a hundred vittce or 
hamlets. Schmidt holds that it was an area of 
a hundred hides of land. Ihre makes it a re- 
cruiting district of a hundred men for battle. 
Lappenberg's opinion is much the same. Eich- 
horn, withKemble and Konrad Maurer, believes 
that it was in its origin a personal division, and 
became territorial at the end of the nomadic 
period, through the occupation by each century 
of a district to dwell in. Waitz so thinks, too, 
but pushes farther, and holds that each of the 
hundred men was given a hide of land. Finally, 
Stubbs says that the only reasonable conclusion 
is " that under geographical hundreds we have 
the variously sized pagi or districts in which 
the hundred warriors settled ; the boundaries 
of these being determined by other causes, as 
the course of rivers, the ranges of hills, the 
distribution of estates to the chieftains, and the 
remnants of British independence " (Const. 
Hist, of England, I. 106). Is it not possible 
that, at last, in this mere allusion of Stubbs to 
" the remnants of British independence " we 
have a clue to the hundred ? We have seen 
the similarity between the provisions of the 
criminal law in Welsh and English customs ; 
we have seen the similarity between the Welsh 
" manor " and the old English manor ; we have 
seen the marked military character of the 
Welsh tribal system, and over against this we 
put the strong military elements of the ancient 
German constitution the hundred and the 
comitatus. What is the inference ? that in the 
progress of the English conquest these similar 
institutions amalgamated in greater or less de- 
gree, precisely as on the Continent analagous 
Roman and German institutions combined in 
different proportions in Frankish Gaul, Visi- 
Gothic Spain, and Lombard Italy. 

Other likenesses in Welsh and English insti- 
tutions fortify this inference. How else in 
Kent, most remote from Wales and the first 
land in Britain to be hallowed by the tread of 
men of the English kin, can the custom of gav- 
elkind be accounted for? Gavelkind is not 
found in the lands conquered by Angles and 
Saxons. Plainly, the Jutes, who in point of 
number were the least of the Teutonic invaders, 
succumbed more than has been supposed to the 
existing Welsh regime (cf. also pp. 79, 86, 88, 
95, 101, 106). 

It will not do for the advocate of the abso- 
lute purity of English institutions to wink at 
facts such as these Mr. Seebohm has brought 
forward. As said in the beginning, he has no- 
where in his work applied the facts he has dis- 



covered, having left the extension of his inquiry 
to another time ; but while Mr. Seebohm is 
writing his companion volume, it behooves the 
enthusiast for the purity of early English insti- 
tutions to redeem his time if he intends to re- 
fute Mr. Seebohm's arguments, for the present 
work, in the opinion of the reviewer, constitutes 
the most formidable assault yet made upon the 
" Teutonic School." 

It may be well, before making an end, to no- 
tice some features for the elucidation of which 
we are indebted to the present work : (1) The 
importance of land as an economic factor in the 
development of tribal society is emphasized. 
Blood relationship lay at the basis of the Welsh 
tribal society from the earliest times, but grad- 
ually proprietorship in land crept in. Yet the 
strength of the former tie is shown in that, like 
everything else, proprietorship was forced into 
a tribal mould. Whatever of land ownership 
grew up in the tribe was tribal ownership, but 
there was nothing like " the modern democratic 
view of a society in which equality of rights 
and shares settled every question" (p. 88). 
The kindred, to the ninth and fourth degree, 
were both related to the land, but through the 
wele, who was regarded as the land-owner of 
the district. In him were vested as landed pro- 
prietor the tribal rights of his wele, so far as 
regards land occupation (pp. 60, 87-9). (2) 
Mr. Seebohm shows that the notion of private 
property was a late growth (p. 95), and that 
the idea of conveyance was "foreign to the 
tribal system in its early stages," and due to 
the influence of the church (pp. 150, 193, 
226-7). (3) The infiltration of secular influ- 
ences into the Welsh church bears a striking 
resemblance to the history of the church among 
the Franks. The church set itself to convert 
the tribal lords in Wales, and they, as the lords 
in Frankish Gaul, immediately rushed into her 
offices ; the ecclesiastical abuses enumerated by 
Welsh historians might be taken, with the 
change of names of persons and places, for a 
page of Gregory of Tours. 

Nothing has yet been said of the style of the 
work. As the reader has probably discovered, 
" The Tribal System in Wales " is not easy 
reading. And yet it is relieved here and there 
by touches of light and color which raise that 
page at least from the dull dust of economics. 
Such a page is that describing the hearth of 
the Welshman's home, with the mark of the 
kindred upon it. We are told : 

" The covering and uncovering of the fire had a pic- 
turesque significance. Whether the fire were of wood

or turf, the hearth was swept out every night. The 
next thing was to single out one particular glowing em- 
ber the seed of the fire which was carefully restored 
to the hearth and covered up with the remaining ashes 
for the night. This was the nightly covering of the fire. 
The morning process was to uncover the ' seed of fire,' 
to sweep out the ashes under which it was hid, and then 
deftly to place back the live ember on the hearth, piling 
over it the fuel for the new day's fire. This was the 
uncovering of the fire, which thus from year end to year 
end might never go out. Anyone who has seen the pro- 
cess performed on a Celtic hearth will understand the 
natural transition in the mind of the Welsh poet, Henry 
Vaughan, in his lines on Sleep,' from the high-flown 
metaphor : 

' The pious soul by night 
Is clouded like a star . . .' 
to the more homely one 

* Though sleep, like ashes, hide 
My lamp and life . . .' 
and see at once the symbolic significance " (pp. 82-3). 

We shall look eagerly for Mr. Seebohm's 
promised sequel, for the present work is prob- 
ably the most important contribution to insti- 
tutional history made by an English writer since 
the death of Sir Henry Summer Maine.

A work " practical " and " Christian " is that 
presented by Dr. Crafts in his " Practical Christian 
Sociology." It breathes the fire of genuine phil- 
anthropy and reform. In the five lectures and nu- 
merous notes, almost every question of human in- 
terest is touched. The references to books and 
documents are valuable. The questions, topics, 
tables, and indexes are very suggestive, but badly 
arranged. The statistics and other data are used 
as illustrations of accepted doctrine, not as instru- 
ments of research. The discussion will open heart 
and eye and awaken the social conscience, but it 
will give no adequate notion of the path by which

men can attain an independent judgment. The 
social ethics of Church, Family, Education, Indus- 
try, and Citizenship, are treated with ability and 
moral earnestness, though not without a bias which 
makes it necessary to go over the grounds of reason- 
ing for one's self. 

The art of illustration is used with fine effect in 
the chapters of the book which set before us the 
" Life of the Poor in Great Cities." Such men as 
Mr. R. A. Woods, Mr. J. A. Riis, and Sir Walter 
Besant bring to mind the various aspects of crowded 
misery, the hopes and needs of the distressed. The 
material has already been issued in " Scribner's Mag- 
azine," but is now presented in convenient book form. 
American and European conditions are described. 

Dr. Gladden writes with so much knowledge and 
spiritual force that he can afford to indulge repose 
in style. Every paragraph in his " Ruling Ideas of 
the Present Age " is instantly intelligible, and yet 
we are led to consider some of the most profound 
thoughts about life and duty. There is no pretense 
of scientific and technical discussion, or unfolding 
of economic or political doctrine, but " ruling ideas " 
are treated in the spirit of a seer, a prophet 
Fatherhood, Brotherhood Sacred and Secular, Prop- 
erty, Religion and Politics, Public Opinion, Phari- 
saism, are some of the topics. 

It is always interesting to watch the play of a 
vigorous intellect about a social problem, and it is 
helpful to the unfolding of an argument when a 
sagacious and disciplined business man contributes 
his reflections. Mr. O. D. Ashley, in " Railways 
and their Employees," discusses the subject of the 
relations of corporations to their employees in close 
touch with the facts. He reasons from experience 
and successful trials, not from pure invention. He 
advises corporations to provide sick benefits, life 
insurance, pensions, out of income, and offers as a 
motive the more efficient and faithful service which 
would thus be secured. The examples of success- 
ful undertakings are found in European and Amer- 
ican life. He seems to have gathered his data while 
he was writing the book, a method which is natural 
enough to a busy tradesman, but has its disadvan- 
tages from the standpoint of thoroughness of treat- 
ment. He does not seem to be acquainted with 
some of the most important works on the subject 
nor with some of the most conspicuous examples of 
prosperous cooperation. His skepticism about co- 
operation initiated by workingmen may thus be 
partly accounted for. In spite of these limitations 
the academic defenders of the cooperation principle 
will justly be encouraged by the judgment of a 
leader in large enterprises. The author feels quite 
sure that Western railroads will never have an 
income sufficient to provide for pensions and insur- 
ance until the laws permit them to combine to stop 
rate-cutting. He does not seem to be aware that 
there are other leaks to be stopped. The popular 
belief about stock-watering, thefts by directors, un- 
fair contracts with freight companies, he does not 
consider. The chief value of the book lies in the 



1896.]

evidence it offers that the great managers of capital 
are coming to recognize their social responsibility 
in relation to the men who help them make their 
vast fortunes. The chapters on Socialism and 
Strikes show that these spectres of dread have much 
to do with the introduction of a fairer method. 

In his "Anarchy or Government?" Mr. W. M. 
Salter affirms that anarchy (absence of govern- 
ment) is a possibility, but so remote that we may 
set it aside in our age as visionary. Government 
is necessary in order to protect national life and 
all its processes and goods. But when we go so 
far we must go forward. The protection of life 
and property means more than militia and police ; 
it involves education, poor relief, and the use of 
the governmental machinery as the organ of pub- 
lic convenience. Government tends to develop a 
sense of solidarity, a deep social consciousness of 
unity and sympathy. " The social consciousness, 
in proportion as it is real, demands government 
under existing circumstances ; but finally the social 
consciousness may be so perfect that government 
will be allowed to drop away like an out-grown 
shell." The attempt is made to judge the recent 
Pullman strike in the light of the ethical principles 
of the book. 

The small volume on " Labor in its Relations to 
Law " is a very convenient summary of the com- 
mon and statute law in force in this country in re- 
spect to the employment contract, strikes, boycotts, 
and the various questions connected with these phe- 
nomena. The author is to issue a larger " Hand- 
book " on the same subject. The chapters here no- 
ticed were given at the Plymouth School of Ethics 
in 1895. 

The main thesis of " Our Industrial Utopia " is 
that we are sick from superfluity and victims of 
imagination. It is not necessity which torments us, 
nor corporations which oppress us, but the craving 
for more superfluity which goads and vexes us. The 
defence of corporations, House of Lords, Senate, 
and trusts, is so rare in our days as to be positively 
interesting. A public sated with attacks on " bloated 
bondholders " and vile " money-bags " and " unscrup- 
ulous trusts," "vampires," and "Octopus," may 
here find rest and refreshment before renewing 
the attack. Benjamin Franklin, spite of recent crit- 
icism, is canonized and his image restored to its 
pedestal. It is true the author seems to be able to 
go through our cities with eyes, ears, and heart tight 
shut, but in many points, spite of his " mind-cure " 
panacea, he launches some keen shafts. In our age, 
when the socialistic tendency is dominant to monot- 
ony, such a book may be condiment, and appetizes, 
even if it does not provide nutriment. 

The recent death of " Stepniak " will give added 
interest to his " King Stork and King Log, a Study 
of Modern Russia." To those who peer into the 
cloudland of Russian political and ecclesiastical 
despotism, these pages may afford some help. We 
can hardly expect absolute history from the radical 
and persecuted exile. But studying the mind of 



Stepniak we are weighing some of the forces which 
work, even by methods of human wrath, toward a 
clearer day and a happier lot. Americans will find 
in the first volume a brief but sympathetic account 
of the sect of Stnndists and the way in which the 
Russian Government has treated them. The style 
is free from violence and exaggeration, but the most 
calm recital of facts, if they be facts, fills one with 
distress and indignation. 

Professor Patten has written some extremely sug- 
gestive chapters, in his " Theory of Social Forces," 
on the social forces which make for progress. In 
the earlier part of the essay there seems to be some 
doubtful and not entirely luminous reasoning about 
the origins of " mental mechanism " and biological 
impulses to progress ; but the chapters on " A Social 
Commonwealth " and " Normal Progress " move on 
modern and more stable ground, where there is less 
reason and room for wise guesses. Physical forces 
are given due place; aesthetic factors are highly 
honored ; economic elements are clearly treated ; 
and, what has been rare in such purely academic 
and scientific discussions, the essential religious and 
Christian ideals are frankly recognized among the 
agencies of progress. This portion of the essay 
must be regarded as a most important contribution 
to the discussion, as it helps to restore the balance 
of thought, to present the spiritual beliefs in some- 
thing like a true perspective, and to help men of our 
age over the superficial criticism of Comte which 
was carried forward on the powerful current of his 
magnificent scheme of social philosophy. There is 
here a chance to run out beyond strict science to the 
visions of the author's individual Weltanschauung 
a sort of Thomas Aquinas hierarchy (p. 129). The 
national feeling is treated with scant justice (p. 
102). Why should it cease any more than friend- 
ship or domestic attachments ? Why should patriot- 
ism contradict philanthropy? The denial of the 
possibility of a social philosophy because we cannot 
compare the human race with the races which in- 
habit other planets seems fanciful, although we can- 
not doubt that a better philosophy will arise when 
we have wings or other means of communication 
with our nearest neighbors. The suggestion (p. 150) 
that moral feelings are impediments to progress 
arises from a too narrow and negative definition of 
morality. If morality is conceived as a positive 
force under the Golden Rule it would have no such 
tendency as the author imagines. 

No student of social pathology and of charitable 
work can afford to miss the annual Reports of the 
National Conference of Charities and Corrections. 
They are simply indispensable. The "Charities 
Review " has now practically become the monthly 
organ of the Conference and will serve as a constant 
reminder of its work. The last Report shows two 
new elements, the work of the scientific theorists of 
the colleges and universities, and the work of the 
residents in Social Settlements. The latter feature 
is to be even more prominent in the future.

RELIGIOUS [LITERATURE, THEORETICAL, 
AND PRACTICAL.* 

Those who find any discouragement in the fact 
that the religious literature of our time is filled 
with bold and sharp criticism, should be encouraged 
by the further fact that it is also practical in many 
new ways ; in many new ways strives to understand 
and remove the evils that have so long vexed society. 
We have nothing to apprehend from criticism, al- 
though it may seem to be destructive in form, so 
long as it is associated with an active corrective 
mood of mind. The religious literature which flows 
in upon us in full stream aims, much of it, at a regen- 
eration of life which must, in the end, put us in firmer 
possession of spiritual truth. It is certainly well to 
know of the doctrine, by doing the will of God. 

" The Messages of the Seven Churches of Asia " 
demands respect both by the excellency of its pur- 
pose and by the diligence with which it is pursued. 
It is intended for good old-fashion people, of 
whom we are glad to believe there are many, and 
will bring to them comfort and that form of edifi- 
cation of which they are capable. It is written 
under the ruling idea that every portion of Scrip- 
ture has a specific and divine purpose by which it 
is united with every other portion, and that all taken 
together make a complete and immaculate record. 
It is not fitted, therefore, to play any part in current 
discussion, or to bring it any light. Fortunately 
the volume, though a large one, confines itself to 
the mere margin of the Apocalypse, and so saves 
the reader from a hopeless wandering among the 
prophetic imagery of which its body is made up. 
No one with the temper here indicated has ever 
pushed into the heart of the book and reached any- 
thing which could be called dry land. The volume 
shows somewhat, in spite of its unswerving belief, 
the modern method by giving the subject an histor- 
ical and geographical background. Compelled by 
the facts of the past to accept a figurative coming of 
Christ, it still clings, in reference to the future, with

"The Johannean Problem" is a clear and concise 
rendering of the argument for the authenticity of 
the fourth gospel. " It is our purpose to summa- 
rize the evidence for the genuineness of the fourth 
gospel so far as ascertained at the present time." 
This task, certainly not an unimportant one, the 
author has satisfactorily performed. It would 
hardly be possible to find as much on this topic in 
as compact a form elsewhere. The work is thor- 
ough and candid. It is difficult to resist the force 
of the internal evidence, especially as presented by 
Bishop Lightfoot. 

" The Two St. Johns " is a life of John the Dis- 
ciple and John the Baptist, extended by reflection 
and enforcement after the manner of a sermon. It 
is a book of practical piety, of good taste and good 
judgment, and is fitted to render the service of a 
religious tract. 

" Nature and Deity " is a noteworthy book. The 
theme is treated in a comprehensive and penetrative 
way. The author shows a strong grasp of thought. 
The object of the volume is " the rationalization of 
religion." This is to be done by finding in expe- 
rience widely interpreted the impulse and law of 
our religious life. This impulse is the quest of the 
ideal. Our religious life is given in our natural life. 
How given ? is the inquiry of our author. The suf- 
ficiency of natural law in the sphere of religion is 
the postulate of the book. It is well fitted, on the 
one hand, to steady the steps of those who are los- 
ing the footing of faith ; and to make, on the other 
hand, more cautious the steps of those who are pur- 
suing the unseen in a conventional and assured way. 
It is easy for us to accept the general conclusion 
of the book, though we cannot feel that the inner 
force of truth receives quite equal emphasis with its 
outer form. The narrowing tendency of a primarily 
empirical inquiry seems to us to te distinctly pres- 
ent. " Nature coheres by an imminent or inherent 
vital law." We are entitled to more than this. As 
certainly as a vital process transcends a mechanical 
one, so certainly does an intellectual and spiritual 
process surpass a vital one. Nature coheres by a 
complex process, both vital and spiritual. Neither 
do we think that religion is adequately represented 
as an effort to harmonize our lives with universal 
power. The religious life is harmonized with uni- 
versal power, but by virtue of a transcendent im- 
pulse. The difficulty here, however, may arise from 
the inability to say all things at once. It is a vol- 
ume worthy the consideration of those who study 
the inner reason of the ways of life. 

It is not possible to adequately characterize " The 
Christ of To-Day " in a brief space ; but we have 
no alternative. The temper of the book is of the 
best. There is much everywhere to which one 
would heartily assent. The enthusiasm with which 
the subject is presented is boundless. Yet one is 
not quite satisfied. There is too much rhetoric in 
the book for its best effect. Not that the rhetoric 
is bad ; on the other hand, it is good, but it leads

to an exaggeration and reiteration which are incon 
sistent with the clearest, most persuasive thought. 
The aim of the author is to enforce the divinity of 
Christ, especially on the practical side as the re- 
demptive force of the world. This aim is the exact 
opposite of that of the volume we have just consid- 
ered. The purpose of the one author is to find God 
in nature ; of the other, to find him in the revela- 
tion of Christ. In lucidity and closeness of thought, 
the first author has decidedly the advantage. Dr. 
Gordon is not as explicit as his theme requires him 
to be on either of the two essential parts of his sub- 
ject : what is meant by the divinity of Christ, and 
how is the salvation of man involved in it. The 
difficulty with most persons who doubt this divinity 
is, that it seems to them an obscure, un verifiable 
dogma, and one, if accepted, of no obvious practical 
value. It is through the words of Christ, their truth 
and their love, that we find access to God ; not by 
virtue of any mystery of his being. Concerning 
this we are at liberty to maintain any theory which 
seems best to cover the facts ; knowing that any 
and every conception will be inadequate. This vol- 
ume will be satisfactory to those who share the be- 
liefs of its author ; but will not persuasively lead 
those who stand remote from them. 

" A Study of Death " is an unusual, a singular 
book. It is a prose poem, after the method of 
Browning, and must be wrestled with by most read- 
ers with something of the penetration and patience 
that that author imposes. The title is suggestive, 
not descriptive. The theme is not death simply, but 
all the darkness which braids the light of the world. 
It is a discursive treatise on moral chiaroscuro. The 
author has a highly cultivated mind of remarkable 
insight and unbounded faith. Faith is with him 
not so much the product of a reasoning process as 
of wide vision. The shadows of the world are visi- 
ble and inseparable parts of its beauty. They carry 
no disturbance to the mind, and cast no burden on the 
spirit. " Faith boldly occupies the field of pessim- 
ism, finding theism its largest hope." The volume is 
full of insight, and contains passages of great force 
and beauty. Most will need to read it in a detached 
manner, taking a little now and then, as they can 
make use of it. One feels as though the author had 
gone forth in a clear night among the mountains, 
had seen strange, vanishing, beautiful things, min- 
gled them with his own sensitive, vivacious thoughts, 
and rehearsed them in a sporadic way as the impulse 
prompted. The progress and adherence of the vol- 
ume are quite as much in the feelings elicited as in 
its logical continuity. One must tread lightly if he 
is to keep step with the writer. 

The next two volumes, " Christian Teaching and 
Life " and " The Spiritual Life," are of a practical 
type, and are sent out by the American Baptist Pub- 
lication Society. The first is designed to be an aid 
in Biblical study. The general topics are : The 
teachings of Christ and of the Apostles, The use of 
Creeds, Relation of Christian teaching to Life, Im- 
provement in Christian Teaching. The subordinate 



topics under each of these divisions are stated and 
supported by liberal Scriptural references. The 
work has been perspicaciously and diligently done, 
and the volume will be aidful to those who wish 
either to study or teach the Bible in the approved 
method. The treatment of immediate social ques- 
tions is neither full nor forceful. The second vol- 
ume contains addresses given on various occasions 
by Mr. Needham. It comprises also a brief sketch 
of the life of the author. Mr. Needham has been 
an active evangelist for many years, working by 
himself and in connection with Mr. Moody and 
others of like temper. He has been active in form- 
ing and guiding conferences. The critic's function is 
suspended in the presence of discourses of this kind. 
They are to be chiefly judged by their practical effects. 
A movement cure is not to be estimated by a descrip- 
tion of its processes, but by its actual results. 

" Heredity and Christian Problems " is a pleasant 
and practical presentation of a wide, suggestive 
theme. Dr. Bradford belongs to the still small 
though growing number of ministers who are striv- 
ing to render the truth under the terms of our pres- 
ent knowledge, and to redirect it more skilfully to 
the solution of social problems. This class has not 
only the past behind it, but the present around it, and 
the future before it. The first chapters are occupied 
with a r6sum6 of the law of heredity as expounded 
by various leading authorities ; and cover the ground 
somewhat extendedly. The later chapters apply 
the doctrine to theoretical and practical problems ; 
such as the freedom of the will and the person of 
Christ, education and the home, pauperism, crime, 
and race-renovation. The book is well fitted to 
instruct and to guide the general reader desirous to 
make wisely his contribution to the common wel- 
fare. It is quite often conceded that genius does not 
pass by inheritance. The author seems to accept 
that conclusion. More, however, seems to be en- 
volved in the concession than they are aware of who 
make it. We shall hardly say that genius has fixed 
boundaries, and is distinct in kind from talent and 
intelligence. If it is not, and is not transmissible, 
it becomes improbable that pure intellectual endow- 
ments are transferred. There are so many implica- 
tions of mental power in physical organization, that 
simply physical inheritance goes far to impart moral 
and intellectual quality. 

" Pascal and Other Sermons " constitutes a final 
volume of gleanings from the discourses of Dean 
Church. It is made up chiefly of occasional ser- 
mons preached elsewhere than in St. Paul's. Dean 
Church was one of the most distinguished of En- 
glish preachers of the present generation, and his 
sermons have been extendedly published. They are 
among the best of their kind. What Dean Church 
says of " The Pensee's of Pascal," in its ministration 
to men is true of his own discourses. They deepen 
" the grounds of evolution by elevating the level of 
religious thought, and enlarging its horizon. Devo- 
tion, to be kept pure, needs ideas as well as feel- 
ings." His sermons owe their helpful power to a

profoundly reflective and spiritually earnest frame 
of mind. He renders the spiritual world for him- 
self and for others under the leading beliefs wrought 
out by the Church, and these beliefs show in him, 
as they showed in Pascal and in many another, a 
wonderful power to search the thoughts, strengthen 
them and give them a divinely productive and stim- 
ulating force. The ruling ideas of the discourses 
indicate a somewhat severe orthodoxy. It was by 
virtue of depth of conviction rather than by conces- 
sion to the growth of opinion that Dean Church ex- 
erted his influence. JOHN BASCOM. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Whoever can write anything which 
shall give a true and sufficient idea 
of John Donne, such an idea as will 
make the general reader of poetry understand why 
he is regarded as a poet of surpassing genius, may 
deem himself no longer an apprentice in the art of 
criticism. Donne is the most baffling of the minor 
poets ; Whipple and Lowell, Gosse and Dowden, 
and a number of lesser men, have tried their hands, 
and yet no lover of Donne feels that anything ade- 
quate has been said, and those who know the poet 
still remain an elect number. One bar to a more 
general reading of Donne is now removed by the 
publication of his poems in two volumes (Scribners), 
excellently edited by Mr. E. K. Chambers. A care- 
ful text and sufficient apparatus in the way of vari- 
ants and notes are supplied by the editor, and the 
work appears in the attractive form of the " Muses 
Library," now becoming more and more familiar 
to us. There is, too, a very remarkable portrait, 
which is a better comment on the characteristic 
poems than much that has been written on the sub- 
ject. But in coming to the introduction by Mr. 
George Saintsbury, the reader of other essays on 
Donne will feel a disappointment, less keen now for 
the many that have gone before. Mr. Saintsbury 
is known to be a devoted admirer of the poet, and 
it would go hard if such a one could say nothing 
rightly. Accordingly here, as in what Mr. Saints- 
bury had written of Donne in the " Elizabethan 
Literature," we have several good things well put ; 
but taken all in all no sufficient word is said of the 
real man, the intense, the fascinating, the inscru- 
table poet. True to his own nature, as to the inev- 
itable secrecy of youth, Donne drew around him 
a cloudy something which keeps him forever to him- 
self. And whoever may have penetrated within 
has been unable, on coming forth, to render a good 
account of what he has experienced. The reader 
must still depend upon himself, and here he will 
be helped by Mr. Chambers's notes, for Donne is a 
poet who needs a good deal of annotation, and Mr. 
Chambers is often happy in suggestion and com- 
m ent, and frequently offers something of value as to 
he historic fact. 



An acceptable " A . History of American Literature" 
summary of (Silver, Burdett & Co.), by Profes- 

Americanliterature. gor p L p atte e 5 j g a new text-book 

for schools and colleges. It is, on the whole, an 
acceptable summary of our literary history, well- 
arranged and comprehensive. The author has 
grasped the truth that " no one ever learned litera- 
ture from a text-book," and has not resorted to the 
pernicious practice of making his manual a compen- 
dium of " elegant extracts." Instead, he gives the 
student brief directions, classified as " required read- 
ing " and " suggested reading," and in every way 
encourages him to use the text-book as merely a 
point of departure for the real study of the subject. 
Among the noteworthy features of the book are a 
considerable admixture of American history and 
a larger degree of attention to the political writers 
and orators than their literary importance would 
warrant, the frequent references to works of stand- 
ard criticism, and the numerous bits of brief com- 
ment from other writers that we find inserted in 
appropriate places. We have noticed but few errors. 
The author can hardly be blamed for saying that no 
life of Governor Hutchinson has been written, al- 
though Mr. Hosmer's biography, just published, has 
been for some time announced. We are told that 
the Stedman-Woodberry edition of Poe is in twelve 
volumes instead of ten, and are given the surpris- 
ing information that " the most complete and au- 
thentic biography of Lowell that has yet appeared " 
is Mr. Woodberry's in the " American Men of Let- 
ters " series. We must also protest against the 
one-sided view of Whitman that is given us. To 
say that he is " confessedly the poet of the body," 
without large qualification, is distinctly false. A 
serious omission is that of all mention of Colonel 
Richard Malcolm Johnston from the section devoted 
to Southern novelists. 



Notei of the 
Northern 



The ^ as ' ; na ^ century has found its 
prodigies of the higher life, in schol- 
arship, art, and letters, in Russia and 
the Scandinavian countries. It is perhaps the Ren- 
aissance, now at last reaching most of Northern 
Europe ; but whether a Renaissance or not, it has 
affected the public mind profoundly. Everybody 
has heard something of it ; the names of Tourge- 
nieff and Tolstoi, of Ibsen and BjOrnson, are more 
familiar to many than those of contemporary writ- 
ers of France and Germany. So it is that " Six 
Modern Women" (Roberts), by Laura Marholm 
Hausson, is in a way attractive through its Northern 
coloring. The author is of Swedish family, and of 
the six women, two are Russian, Sonia Kovalesky 
and Marie Bashkirtseff, two Scandinavian, Amelie 
Skram and A. C.-Edgren-Leffler, while of the two 
others, George Egerton, in " Keynotes " at least, 
smacks of the North very strongly. The one real 
Southerner is Eleanora Duse, who is presented to 
us as more remote from the common conception of 
the Italian than any of the others. The book, then, 
arouses one's dormant sympathy with the present 



1896.]

insurgence of the forces of intelligence and heart 
in Northern Europe. It is a restless book, extrav- 
agant and foolish at times, but still with vigor and 
life. As such, many will like to read it, although 
whoever thinks of getting much else will probably 
be disappointed. The author hardly seems a dis- 
passionate observer or a keen analyst, and her think- 
ing and writing border too much upon the spectac- 
ular and the emotional to carry conviction. The 
critical value of the book is small. But beside its 
indication of the movement of ideas, its frankly ex- 
pressed views on men and women are not without 
interest to those who have not a deeply-rooted aver- 
sion to things they cannot applaud. 

An interesting Mr - s - H - J e y es has written, for the 
sketch of useful " Public Men of To-Day" se- 

Mr. Chamberlain. ^ ft yely interesting sketch of 

"The Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain" (F. Warne 
& Co.). Mr. Jeyes writes confessedly from the Con- 
servative standpoint ; but this does not prevent him 
from being generally fair to the pushing and force- 
ful Birmingham Liberal. We are glad to note that 
the book is quite free from personal chatter, the 
author wisely devoting his rather limited space to 
matters likely to interest intelligent people. Mr. 
Chamberlain's public career has been eventful and 
picturesque ; and Mr. Jeyes's outline of it from 
the early days of Mr. Chamberlain's municipal 
activities down to his skilful handling, as Colonial 
Secretary, of the recent complications arising out of 
the insensate foray of Dr. Jameson forms no bad 
sketch of English political history during the period 
embraced. Ample materials are afforded for ena- 
bling the reader to judge of Mr. Chamberlain's 
political aims and convictions, and of his powers as 
a debater. Very effective was his retort courteous 
to the Irish taunt (apropos of his Birmingham re- 
forms ) that his was a " Mayoral mind ": " I will 
confess to you that I am so parochially minded that 
I look with greater satisfaction to our annexation of 
the gas and of the water, to our scientific frontier in 
the improvement area, than I do to the results of 
that Imperial policy which has given us Cyprus and 
the Transvaal ; and I am prouder of having been 
engaged in warring against ignorance, and disease, 
and crime, in Birmingham, than if I had been the 
author of the Zulu war, or had instigated the inva- 
sion of Afghanistan." The volume is neatly made, 
and it contains a good portrait of Mr. Chamberlain. 



Experiments 
in Prose. 



Those who read " Vistas," and ex- 
pected great things from Mr. Will- 
iam Sharp, are disappointed in " Ecce 
Puella " (Way & Williams). It is by no means an 
advance, which is not strange, for the greater part 
of the book seems to have been written, not after 
" Vistas," but before. The piece which gives its 
name to the book is rather a rambling thing on the 
beauty of women that seems originally to have been 
written to go with pictures. It is no very extra- 
ordinary collection of quotations and gossip about 



ideal beauty and historic beauties. The short prose 
fantasies at the end are elaborate developments of 
very slight themes. There remains the " Fragments 
from the Lost Journals of Piero di Cosimo," which 
strikes a much surer note than anything else in the 
book. Not throughout, but certainly here and there, 
are things which touch the right spot. Still the book 
can hardly be called a success, nor will it increase 
Mr. Sharp's reputation. We see but one direction 
in which it has a real interest. This is in its style. 
In the later imaginings Mr. Sharp is striving, with 
many others nowadays, to do with prose what has 
rarely been done with it before. He would make 
it the medium of expression for color, emotion, 
fancy, that has generally taken form in poetry. It 
does not seem to us that he is completely a master 
of his instruments ; there is hardly a page where a 
careful reading aloud would not bring out some 
absolute discord in rhythm, diction, or sentiment. 
But the effort has its charm ; there are not many 
men who have been able to use our language in this 
way, and to the lover of style, at least, there is 
always interest in the attempt. 

A volume ^ r - Bernhard Berenson's "The 

of sound Florentine Painters of the Renais- 

sance " (Putnam), the second of the 
four projected volumes on the Italian painters of 
the period, is now ready. The little book shows the 
same good qualities of critical acumen, sound schol- 
arship, and descriptive accuracy, which mark its 
popular predecessor on the Venetian school. The 
series aims to be a thorough critical presentation of 
the essential characteristics of the great Schools of 
Italy, and a detailed guide to Italian paintings every- 
where as well each volume containing a list of 
principal works and an index of places, which ren- 
ders it a very desirable hand-book for the European 
tourist. Mr. Berenson is an accredited member of 
the scientific school of art criticism, and his data and 
attributions may be relied upon as correct through- 
out. The volumes are very compact, the author's 
aim being to interpret as concisely and clearly as 
possible each School in a way that may enable the 
reader to grasp its historical development and to 
enjoy it aesthetically and intelligently. The frontis- 
piece in the present number shows a portrait pre- 
sumably after Verrochio, which is evidently selected 
rather as a characteristic example of the aim and 
manner of the Florentine School, than by reason of 
the charm of the original. 



Studies in 

classical 

philology. 



After much delay, the University of 
Chicago has published the first vol- 
ume of its long-promised " Studies 
in Classical Philology." The " Studies " are edited 
by the heads of the Departments of Greek, Latin, 
Archaeology, and Comparative Philology ; that is, 
by Professors Shorey, Hale, Tarbell, and Buck. All 
of these scholars contribute to the present volume, 
as well as Professor Capps, of the Department of 
Greek. The contents are as follows : " The Antici-

patory Subjunctive in Greek and Latin," by Mr. 
William Gardner Hale ; " Vitruvius and the Greek 
Stage," by Mr. Edward Capps ; " The Direction of 
Writing on Attic Vases," by Mr. Frank B. Tarbell ; 
" The Oscan-Umbrian Verb-System," by Mr. Carl 
D. Buck ; and " The Idea of Good in Plato's Re- 
public," by Mr. Paul Shorey. With the exception 
of the last-named paper, these studies are of strictly 
technical interest, and appeal only to specialists in 
their several subjects. Mr. Shorey's paper has both 
technical and general interest, since it is possible to 
know something of the ethical system of Plato with- 
out being a classical specialist. Mr. Shorey's rank 
at the head of American Platonists gives exceptional 
value to this discussion, and his compact and weighty, 
but attractive and well-ordered, style makes of his 
paper a contribution to ethical philosophy of the 
highest importance. His essential aim is to make 
clear "the true form and pressure of the body of 
Plato's thought, which sentimental Platonists are 
forever losing in rapt contemplation of its gorgeous 
vestment." _ 

Mr. A. S. Martin's book " On Par-

pleasant byways of literature, giving 
us a historical essay upon the subject, and an abund- 
ant sheaf of illustrative examples. Parody, like all 
other literary forms, began with the Greeks, and 
the author of the " Batrachomyomachia " was, in a 
sense at least, the first great parodist. Aristophanes, 
of course, revelled in parody, and numerous others 
of the ancients tried their hands at it. It is ex- 
tremely interesting to trace the influence of this 
literary form down through the Middle Ages to 
modern times, and Mr. Martin has pursued the task 
with industry and a keen scent. His examples are 
taken from a wide range of English poetry, but we 
are surprised to find that they do not include what 
are unquestionably the best parodies in the language 
those published by Mr. Swinburne in his " Hep- 
talogia." This is all the more surprising from the 
fact that Mr. Martin quotes from the " Heptalogia " 
in his prefatory essay, so that he cannot be charged 
with ignorance of its existence. Calverley, too, 
although quoted from, is not illustrated by his best 
work, " The Cock and the Bull." These are serious 
omissions, and ought not to have been found in a 
work so painstaking and generally acceptable as 
Mr. Martin's undoubtedly is. 



Mr. Field's 
last volume. 



Those who relish the humor of the 
late Mr. Eugene Field may find a 
rather favorable specimen of it in 
"The House" (Scribner), a pretty book detailing 
" an episode in the lives of Reuben Baker, astrono- 
mer, and of his wife Alice." The scene is laid in 
Chicago ; and we rather suspect certain residents of 
the city will find little difficulty in recognizing them- 
selves among the dramatis personce. Mr. Field had 
an amiable way of springing these little surprises on 
people. In the opening chapter Mr. Baker and his 



wife " buy a place "; and in the succeeding ones 
they proceed to furnish and put it in order, the hu- 
mor of the story hinging mainly on the transparent 
simplicity (peculiar to astronomers) in practical mat- 
ters of Mr. Baker. The book is amusing enough, 
and Mr. Field's fun is as usual decidedly " obvious," 
without being exactly coarse. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. W. R. Jenkins, of New York, has added " Quatre- 
Vingt-Treize " to his series of reprints of the novels of 
Victor Hugo. The work is published in a single volume 
of 595 pages, and presents the text complete, together 
with an introduction and English notes prepared by Dr. 
Benjamin Duryea Woodward, of Columbia University. 
Notes are particularly needed by English readers of 
this great book, and Dr. Woodward has supplied the 
desirable information in a compact and acceptable shape. 

The volume of " Trinity Verse," just edited by Mr. 
De Forest Hicks and Mr. Henry Rutgers Remsen, and 
published at Hartford, Connecticut, is, like a former 
volume of similar title (part of whose contents are re- 
produced), made up of verses written for " The Trinity 
Tablet " and other undergraduate publications. There 
are not many familiar names among the writers repre- 
sented, those of Mr. Richard Burton and Mr. C. F. 
Johnson being perhaps the only ones that have attracted 
public attention. Nevertheless, the book contains some 
excellent verse, in moods alternately grave and gay, 
and speaks well for the literary influences at work in 
the institution whence it comes. 

Two stories by Zschokke, " Dar Abenteuer der Neu- 
jahrsnacht " and " Der Zerbrochene Krug," edited by 
Dr. A. B. Faust; Herr Wichert's "An der Major- 
secke," edited by Mr. Charles Harris, and Herr Heyse's- 
" L'Arrabiata," edited by Miss Mary A. Frost, are Ger- 
man texts recently published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. At the same time we have from the American 
Book Co. Frau Hillern's " Hoherals die Kirche," edited 
by Mr. F. A. Dauer; Herr Volkman-Leander's "Trau- 
mereien an Franzosischen Kaminen," edited by Miss 
Amalie Hanstein; and Herr Heinrich Seidel's "Herr 
Omnia," edited by Mr. J. Matthewman. 

Mr. Ernest Rhys has done students of Elizabethan 
literature a real service in editing a collection of " The 
Lyric Poems of Thomas Campion." Such a book would 
not have been possible had it not been for the labors of 
Mr. A. H. Bullen, to whom we practically owe the restor- 
ation to English poetry of one of the sweetest and truest 
singers that our language has ever possessed, and to 
whom Mr. Rhys makes ample acknowledgment. The 
present edition, published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., 
is the first, however, that has made Campion accessible 
to any other than a narrow audience, and is exceedingly 
welcome. 

Mr. A. C. Benson's "Essays," just published by 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co., are thirteen in number, and 
are, for the most part, critical studies of minor English 
authors. The writer says: " I have always chosen, for 
biographical and critical study, figures whose personal- 
ity or writings have seemed to me to possess some sub- 
tle, evasive charm, or delicate originality of purpose or 
view." Among his subjects we find John Hales, Henry 
More, Andrew Marvell, Vincent Bourne, Gray, Blake,,

Keble, and Mr. Edmund Gosse. We wonder how Mr. 
Gosse will relish being described as one of a group of 
" persons about whom hung an undefined promise of 
greater strength than ever issued in performance." 

" The Age of Dryden," by Dr. Richard Garnett, suc- 
ceeds Mr. Dennis's " Age of Pope " in the series of 
" Handbooks of English Literature " (Macmillan), of 
which Professor Hales is the editor. It is an admirable 
book, covering the last forty years of the seventeenth 
century, but leaving out such writers as Milton and 
Clarendon, who belong in spirit to an earlier period. 
Dr. Garnett has classified the writers of the period dis- 
cussed, thus making it an easy matter to refer to the 
philosophy, or the divinity, or the science of the Re- 
storation years. The style of the book is delightful, 
-and the scholarship unimpeachable. 



IjITERARY NOTES.

of the mediaeval Cantefable or song-tale of " Aucassin et 
Nicolette," with versified passages rhymed by Mr. E. W. 
Thomson. 

Judge Robert H. Russell, the senior member of the 
firm of R. H. Russell & Son (De Witt Publishing 
House), died on the 3d of April at his home in Strat- 
ford, Conn. Mr. Russell was Probate Judge in Strat- 
ford for many years. 

Sir Philip Perring has " done into English verse " the 
tc Fables" of Florian, and the work is published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The form is, for the 
most part, rhymed iambic tetrameter, and the transla- 
tion is neat and effective. 

"The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte," in 
Harriet Martineau's condensed translation, appears in a 
new edition (Macmillan), with a specially written intro- 
ductory essay by Mr. Frederic Harrison. It makes 
three volumes of the familiar Bohn library. 

" Tartarin of Tarascon " is the first volume of a uni- 
form edition of Daudet in English, bearing the Dent 
imprint, and published in this country by Messrs. Mac- 
millan & Co. The French illustrations are reproduced, 
and the French mechanical style closely followed. 

The " Kilmarnock " edition of the poems of Burns, 
edited by Mr. J. A. Manson, and published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co., is a beautifully-printed work in two 
volumes, sold at a moderate price. The editor con- 
tributes a discriminating biographical preface of some 
length. 



The Twentieth Century Club of Chicago will close an 
exceptionally interesting season (the seventh of its ex- 
istence), on the eighth of May, with a Brahms evening. 
Mr. W. F. Apthorp comes from Boston to make the 
address, which will be illustrated by a programme of 
songs and chamber music. 

A recent endowment has made it possible for Colum- 
bia University to take the important step of establish- 
ing a School of Music, and it is stated on good authority 
that Mr. E. A. MacDowell is to be called to take charge 
of the work. The appointment would be an admirable 
one for the University, as well as a deserved tribute to 
one of our most brilliant and original composers. 

" The Evolution of Woman " is a series of humorous 
drawings by Mr. H. W. McVickar, printed in black and 
one color, and handsomely published by Messrs. Harper 
& Brothers. Mr. E. Irenseus Stevenson contributes "A 
Man's Preface," in verse; the verses that accompany 
the drawings are not acknowledged, probably because 
they are so bad. The book will serve to while away a 
dull half-hour. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. make the interesting and 
important announcement of a new popular edition of 
that invaluable work, "Chambers's Encyclopaedia," from 
entirely new plates and thoroughly revised to date, 
many of the articles being entirely rewritten. Former 
trade editions of the work will be withdrawn from the 
market. The same firm will issue cheaper editions, re- 
vised and enlarged, of " Lippincott's Gazetteer" and 
" Lippincott's Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and 
Mythology." 

The "Letters of David Ricardo to John Ramsay 
McCulloch, 1816-1823," edited by Dr. J. H. Hollander, 
form a double number of the " Publications of the Amer- 
ican Economic Association." We should also note, as 
having been for some time upon our table, the sketch of 
" British Rule in Central America," by Mr. Ira D. Travis, 
published by the Michigan Political Science Associa- 
tion; and Miss Lucy E. Textor's study of the " Official 
Relations between the United States and the Sioux 
Indians," a publication in the " History and Economics " 
series of the Leland Stanford Junior University. 

Recent attacks in Congress upon the principle of inter- 
national copyright have caused a renewal of activity in 
the American Copyright League. The Executive Coun- 
cil of that organization, at a meeting held April 2, 
adopted the following resolutions: 

"Resolved, That the Executive Council of the American 
Copyright League declares its opposition to further limitation 
of the principle of international copyright by any extension of 
the manufacturing clause. 

" Resolved, That the Council approves the bill offered by 
Mr. Cummings in the present Congress in behalf of American 
dramatists providing more adequate means for the enforce- 
ment of dramatic copyright. 

"Resolved, That the Council approves the creation of a 
separate copyright office as provided in the separate bill now 
pending before Congress. 

" Resolved, That in view of the present revival in copyright 
legislation and of the recent attacks on the principle of inter- 
national copyright, and in view of the desirability of providing 
at an early session of Congress for a copyright commission to 
consider the general subject of copyright law, the treasurer is 
directed to resume the collection of dues, suspended after the 
passage of the Act of 1891, and the Secretary is authorized to 
take steps to increase the membership of the League." 
A general meeting of the League will be called in No- 
vember, until which time it is hoped such objectionable 
measures as the Treloar Bill may be staved off.

THE 



STEARNS BICYCLE 



IS 



The Epitome of Comfort, 

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the " easy-running Stearns "; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, the better it is liked.

" Mr. Smith has succeeded in producing a stirring, thrilling, 
dramatic story . . . and also has achieved a really remark- 
able study of a business woman. . . . ' Tom Grogan ' is an un- 
usual story, surcharged with human sympathy." New York 
Mail and Express. 

" ' Tom Grogan,' the story of the woman who took a man's 
name and a man's place in the world, shows the same appre- 
ciation of character, the same quaint and original humor, and 
the same tender touch which has marked the literature al- 
ready given by Mr. Smith to the world. While the narrative 
is notably fresh and novel, the author has parted with none 
of his genius of style, and Tom Grogan must claim our affec- 
tion in her way almost as imperatively as Col. Carter in his."

"As a whole, the book must be regarded as the most unprejudiced discussion of the broader aspects of modern political 
and social life that has yet been produced." Morning Post. 

" It is extremely difficult, without lengthy quotation, ... to give a clear, much less an adequate, idea of the political and 
social significance of this brilliant and many-sided inquiry. The fact is, the book touches a vast group of questions which inti- 
mately concern the political, religious, and social controversies of the hour." Leeds Mercury.

King. His adventures in love and war are intensely fascinat- 
ing, and the reader puts down the book with extreme reluc- 
tance. The author has carefully studied the history of the 
times, and, besides being a thrilling tale, his story is a charm-

making, and blood-letting in the story, but the literary touch 
given to his work by the author places his product far above 
the average." World, New York.

Robert Louis Stevenson's Unfinished Romance, Ready May 20. 

WEIR OF HERMISTON. 

Stevenson's Estimate of the Story, as quoted in Mrs. Strong's Diary : 

" The story unfolds itself before me to the least detail. There is nothing left in doubt. I never felt so 
before in anything I ever wrote. It will be my best work. I feel myself so sure in every word." 

" Surely no son of Scotland has died, leaving with his last breath a worthier tribute to the land he loved." 

SIDNEY COLVIN. 

In no case of an unfinished story has an author left so full a forecast of his intention. Mr. Stevenson had 
outlined to his amanuensis, Mrs. Strong, the plot of what remained unwritten, and by her aid an editorial note 
of nearly twenty pages gives it so fully that the reader is left in no doubt of the result or of the fate of any of 

the characters. 

It is issued in an attractive form. i2mo, $1.50.

two volumes, $2.25; The Amateur Emigrant, $1.25; The Ebb Tide, $1.25; Macaire, $1.00 are now the 
publishers in this country of all of Mr. Stevenson's works. 

A LADY OF QUALITY. By Mrs. FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT. 12mo, $1.50. 

I. ZANGTOTILL in the Critic : "It appears to me the most interesting and remarkable thing Mrs. Burnett hag done. It will add a new field 
to her already ample province. If its teaching be more sentimental than scientific, there is a vivid interest in its episodes ; and if one of its 
beat scenes was partially anticipated in the life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and the murder incident anticipated in 'Izehl,' by Armand 
Silvestre, this only proves how true it is in some parts and how dramatic in others." 

CINDERELLA, and Other Stories. By RICHARD HARDING DAVIS. 12mo, $1.00. 

There are five stories in this new volume, one of which is a new Van Bibber story, and deals with New York scenes 
and characters in the portrayal of which Mr. Davis is so justly celebrated. The volume also contains "Miss Delamar's 
Understudy," which has aroused so much favorable comment, and three other stories, all characteristic of the author in 
his happiest vein.

SOUTHIVORTH'S 

Essentials of Arithmetic 

Some quotations from a review by DAVID EUGENE 
SMITH, of the Michigan State Normal School, published 
in the March number of " The School Review " : 

"It is one of the very few works that have successfully 
broken from tradition. . . . Mr. South worth is the hundredth 
man, yea, even the thousandth. . . . This is high praise. 
What is there in ' The Essentials of Arithmetic ' that is so 
distinctive and at the same time so excellent as to deserve such 
an encomium ? ... In the first place the author has dared to 
attempt to make pupils think, actually think for themselves 
without telling them what they ought to think. . . . Further- 
more the author has dared to insert the definitions where they 
belong, that is, after the concepts are entirely familiar, and to 
say, ' For reference.' Such pedagogy is as refreshing as it is 
unusual. . . . Another venturesome idea has been carried 
out, and one which may militate against the sale of the book ; 
the author has insisted that the teacher should also think, 
and should know something outside of the text-book. For 
example, two methods of performing an operation are given 
and the pupil is told to state which is the better, and why ; 
no bint is given to teacher or pupil ; each must think. . . . 
Still another feature which makes us love the book for the 
enemies it will make, is the introduction of the simple equa- 
tion where it belongs. ... Is it not sound pedagogy, and are 
we not inevitably coming to it ? It lets in the light ; it clears 
up the mystery ; it makes psychology and logic, instead of the 
freaks of history, the factors in the arrangement of the course, 
and it insists that the making of an easy thing hard is not per 
se commendable. . . . But there is one thing which everyone 
will commend, namely, the work in oral arithmetic. This is 
introduced skilfully, and progressively, and continuously from 
the first day to the last. ... In one other respect the book 
is remarkable. It is up to date. Those who have much to do 
with the examination of text-books as they appear will appre- 
ciate the truth of the statement that this feature is really re- 
markable. Here is a text-book which, under exchange, speaks 
of postal and express money-orders, perhaps the most common 
instruments of exchange known to the majority of people. 
And this is only one of a considerable number of features that 
come under the same category. . . . Besides introducing alge- 
braic forms where they belong, the work introduces metrical 
geometry where it belongs. This is done in a natural manner 
and to the extent that is demanded in common life. More- 
over the child is still required to keep to accurate arithmet- 
ical forms in his mensuration. ... In the arrangements of 
the solutions the work is a marvel. It gives the numerical 
solution as a pupil is advised to arrange it ; it then gives the 
formal solution, in numbered or lettered steps, thus covering 
the logical analysis ; the teacher may call for either or both 
as the subject demands. . . . After such unusual praise it 
may be asked, ' Has the book, then, no weak points ? ' Was 
there ever a book without them ? Was there ever a book 
without some misprint, some questionable assertions, some 
things that would not please every critic? This book has 
them ; but they are few in number, and are so much over- 
shadowed by its excellences that it would serve no good pur- 
pose to enter the limited field at this time, or to mar the pleas- 
ure of reviewing a book that is really superior, and that is 
destined to do a great deal to improve American education."

PL A YING WITH FIRE. 

A measure is now under consideration in the 
national Congress which should call forth an 
indignant protest from all persons who are inter- 
ested in the education of youth, as well as from 
all persons who stand for the belief that civili- 
zation means something very different from the 
rule of brute force, something entirely unlike 
the militant organization which seems to be the 
accepted ideal of European society at the pres- 
ent day. The measure in question is styled " A 
Bill to establish a bureau of military education 
and to promote the adoption of uniform mili- 
tary drill in the public schools of the several 
States and Territories." It has had two read- 
ings in the Senate, and is now in the hands of 
the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. It 
contemplates the creation in the War Depart- 
ment of a new Bureau, the preparation of a 
text-book of drill regulations adapted to the use 
of public schools, the free distribution of such 
book to the schools that may apply for it, and 
the direct encouragement of military training 
for schoolboys throughout the country. This 
measure is a natural consequence of the tall 
talk about war that has been heard so frequently 
of late in the Capitol at Washington, and made 
so much of by sensational newspapers almost 
everywhere. In the present inflamed condition 
of a considerable section of public opinion it is 
not impossible that such a measure, obnoxious 
as it is to every genuine educator and every 
right-thinking person, may find its way to the 
statute-book, unless the opposition of the sober- 
minded shall find prompt and vigorous expres- 
sion. 

One of the greatest dangers to which our 
public schools are exposed is that of the raids 
so frequently made upon them by bands of well- 
meaning but ill-balanced riders of hobbies. One 
set of people gets the notion that some form of 
mechanical discipline in morals and religion is 
greatly needed, and moves heaven and earth to 
secure the introduction of Bible-readers or eth- 
ical catechisms into the school curricula. An- 
other set becomes possessed of the fantastic 
idea that our children need more than anything 
else to be guarded against the danger of becom- 
ing drunkards, and drafts measures (like the 
monstrous legislation recently enacted in New 



294 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



York) for the compulsory adoption of what is 
called " scientific instruction in temperance," a 
kind of instruction which is usually repudiated 
by those who have a right to speak for science, 
and which proves to be temperate only in name. 
Another set of hobbyists finds in manual train- 
ing a panacea for all social ills, and does its best 
to convert our schools into carpentry kindergar- 
tens. Raids of this sort upon public education 
have become alarmingly frequent of late, and 
it is not surprising that some of our congress- 
men should wish to organize a foray of their 
own. Fortunately, our decentralized system of 
education makes it impossible for the national 
government to do anything mandatory, and mil- 
itary drill cannot be imposed upon the schools 
of any State without its own consent. Still, it 
is desirable that the friends of education do 
everything possible to prevent such a bill as 
that now under consideration from passing into 
law, and we are glad to observe that the Amer- 
ican Humanitarian League and other bodies 
have undertaken the organization of an active 
opposition to the measure. 

There are only two arguments that can pos- 
sibly be urged in favor of military discipline 
for our schoolboys. One of them is that war 
will remain a normal accompaniment of civil- 
ization, and that training for war is conse- 
quently an essential part of the education of 
the male citizen. The other argument is that 
military discipline serves a useful purpose in 
itself, being the best means of securing physical 
vigor and a manly carriage. 

The second of these arguments is easily to 
be disposed of. The few hours of military 
drill that are all it would be possible to provide 
for in any public-school system would not go 
far in securing the physical results that we may 
admit to be desirable. On the other hand, we 
believe that the best authorities regard military 
drill as a very imperfect means of physical de- 
velopment, and much inferior to the scientific 
systems of our better gymnasia. Dr. Sargent, of 
the Harvard Gymnasium, for example, says 
that military drill does not, to any extent, meet 
the physiological demands of the body. He 
then goes on to deny the common statement 
that drill tends to make young men erect and 
graceful, and sums up his opinion of the mat- 
ter in the following weighty paragraph : "After 
taking the most favorable view possible of mil- 
itary drill as a physical exercise, we are led to 
conclude that its constrained positions and 
closely localized movements do not afford the 
essential requisites for developing the muscles 



and improving the respiration and circulation, 
and thereby improving the general health and 
condition of the system. We must further 
conclude that in case of any malformation, local 
weakness, or constitutional debility, the drill 
tends, by its strain upon the nerves and pro- 
longed tension on the muscles, to increase the 
defects rather than to relieve them." Those 
who have a constitutional prejudice against 
"professors" and their opinions may be referred 
to the views of Lieutenant-Colonel Edmands of 
the Boston Cadets, to whom no one will be 
likely to refuse the title of " practical man," 
and who says : " I only know that school drill 
injures the militia service, and I never saw a 
school successfully drilled. ... In Boston the 
effect of school drill has been to make boys 
round-shouldered and narrow-chested. I never 
saw a school company well set up in my life." 

As for the argument based upon the immi- 
nence of war, and the importance of being pre- 
pared to fight when the time comes, it really 
amounts, when used in defence of military drill 
for schoolboys, to an insidious plea for the 
abandonment of the policy which has caused 
this nation to make so unprecedented a pro- 
gress in wealth and power. Happy as we are 
in climate, in vigorous national stock, and in 
richness of natural resources, we are happiest 
of all in our freedom from any necessity of 
taking upon our shoulders the crushing burden 
of militarism. No power in the world wants 
to make war upon the United States, or would 
dream of attacking them except upon the 
strongest provocation. As far as the question 
of war and peace is concerned, the future is 
absolutely in our own hands, and no nation in 
history has ever had our opportunity of show- 
ing how vastly more important than the victo- 
ries of war are the victories of peace. To con- 
template a military future for this Republic, to 
encourage the hot-headed minority who would 
like to look forward to such a future, is sheer 
madness, and anything that remotely tends to 
arouse or to strengthen the military spirit in 
our population, should be frowned upon by 
everyone who has at heart the interests of civ- 
ilization. 

The gravest objection to such a bill as that 
which has occasioned these remarks is not, then, 
that it would cost money, or that it would divert 
educational forces from their proper channel, or 
that it would provide for physical training of 
a sort inferior to that already provided in our 
schools, but rather, in the words of the New York 
"Nation," that it "springs from the same sense-

less and brutal war-spirit that is making wreck 
of so many public reputations, and continually 
threatening to embroil us with other nations. 
What its promoters really have in mind is, not 
physical exercise, not parades and displays, but 
the spreading in childish minds of the idea that 
fighting is the noblest occupation of man, that 
we are all the while exposed to insults and ag- 
gressions, and must be ready to whip all crea- 
tion on call. Now the boys have too much of 
this idea already. It is in their minds that 
the furibund patriotism of Lodge and Frye 
finds most admiration in fact, so far as we 
have observed, its only admiration. What they 
need, together with their fellow juveniles in the 
United States Senate, is, not military drill, but 
instruction in good manners, in the arts and 
love of peace, and in ambition to make the 
country decent and habitable instead of feared." 
It is for these reasons that we hope and trust 
that the objectionable measure will fail to be- 
come law as it certainly must fail if those 
who are opposed to it, and to the spirit which 
it represents, will only take the trouble to make 
their feelings known to their representatives in 
Congress. There is no partisanship in a ques- 
tion like this, and consequently nothing to pre- 
vent good men of all parties from joining in the 
effort to defeat so pernicious a piece of proposed 
legislation. 



FROM AVALON. 



It is not lost, that green and tranquil isle, 
Encircled by the arms of summer tides, 
That sway, and smile, and whisper of the sea. 
Not far away it lies; its fragrant shades 
Shot through by golden lances of the sun, 
And stirred by gentle airs that wander still 
On noiseless feet, to find the chamber fair 
Where, couched on mystic herbs and asphodel, 
Healed of his hurts, King Arthur lies asleep. 
Oft have I found its shelter. When the stress 
Of warring winds, and sharp tumultuous storms 
Have left me spent and breathless on the field, 
Then my swift thoughts, for healing and for rest, 
Bear me away to peaceful Avalon. 
The sweet enchantments of the bounteous queen 
Have changed the shifting waves to fields of rye, 
And seas of meadow-grass, that softly break 
Against the low-browed wall that shuts about 
The blessed trees, veiled in eternal bloom. 
The bees make happy tumult, and the air 
Quivers with gauzy, bright-winged, dancing motes 
And small white butterflies go shimmering by, 
Silent as souls, among the scented boughs. 
The skies bend low; the pale moon idly drifts, 
A phantom ship, to some celestial port, 
And night and day flow on in still content 
Through blissful years, in changeless Avalon. 

EMILY HUNTINOTON MILLER. 



SHAKESPEARE IN LEXICOGRAPHY. 

This subject is suggested as one of practical im- 
portance, in connection with recent and present 
development in university study of English, by the 
special prominence of Shakespeare in the university 
courses. Lexicography seems to be the most impor- 
tant channel through which the results of " higher 
criticism " in English, that can be attained origi- 
nally only by the few fortunate university students, 
may be communicated to the many who must depend 
upon the scholars for information and guidance. 
Dictionaries of English have made wonderful ad- 
vances, both in method and in clearness and accu- 
racy, but the possibilities are still far beyond the 
actualities. The field for new lexicographic work 
will be open as long as one of these possibilities is 
unconquered, and this means practically always. 
Shakespeare is the author who furnishes the best 
means of testing the work already done, and of indi- 
cating a special need of improvement, but without 
intending disparagement of present accomplishment 
save in the matter of a few details. 

Writing of the teaching of English in American 
universities, very few of the twenty professors who 
contribute to a book recently published fail to men- 
tion Shakespeare especially, and some of them even 
say that his writings are made a special and sepa- 
rate study. In the introduction to the book is the 
following : "If literature is to count for so much 
among our higher interests, the manner in which we 
set about to prepare the way for it is surely of the 
utmost importance, and any misdirection of energy 
in this preparation means an almost incalculable 
loss." Can there be any question that false defini- 
tions of words, sometimes involving a most absurd 
contradiction of terms, exemplify a misdirection of 
energy? And is not the dictionary the commonest 
tool in the preparation spoken of? 

Professor Dodge of the University of Illinois 
says : " Of far greater importance [than the study of 
Chaucer] is the question of how to approach Shake- 
speare. It is bad enough to confine ourselves to the 
grammatical forms of Chaucer ; it is little far [sic] 
from criminal to do so with [sic] our mighty dram- 
atist. Not that the grammatical and linguistic side 
shall be ignored ; it must, however, be reduced to a 
minimum, as a means to a greater end. Richard 
Grant White to the contrary, Shakespeare requires 
much annotation of various kinds, in order that the 
study may yield its full return." (JSnpassant, would 
not the last sentence be much better with the initia- 
tory word notwithstanding?) An inference natu- 
rally drawn from this criticism namely, that Mr. 
White asserts that little annotation is necessary 
seems to be somewhat inaccurate ; closer to the truth 
would be an assertion that more annotation is neces- 
sary than he made. His notes really are very mea- 
gre, notwithstanding his explicit claim of sufficient 
copiousness made as follows in the preface to the 
Riverside Shakespeare : " In determining what pas- 
sages were sufficiently obscure to justify explanation, 



296 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



the editor, following eminent example, took advice 
of his washerwoman, and also of the correctors of 
the press in the office in which the edition was 
printed, to whose intelligent suggestions and thought- 
ful care he owes much which it gives him pleasure 
to acknowledge. He therefore ventures to say to 
any reader who may not be able to understand a 
passage which is left without remark, that the fault 
may possibly be that of some other person than the 
poet or the editor." This evidently means that the 
editor thinks he has explained everything that needs 
explanation. His claim is strengthened by the more 
explicit following assertion : " Explanation of obso- 
lete words and phrases is given wherever it is needed, 
and as often as occasion requires. . . . Every word 
that needs explanation is explained in this edition 
whenever and wherever it occurs, unless, indeed, it 
is found twice in the same scene : in which case 
repetition was deemed superfluous." 

Shakespeare undoubtedly used many words that 
are now obsolete, and many others in senses no 
longer living. It would not be difficult to find in any 
unabridged dictionary a large number of instances 
of both kinds not noted by Mr. White, and often 
the reason for his omission of explanation must have 
been failure to perceive a common need. Research 
in the case of some of these words discloses a ten- 
dency to lexicographic error ; and this is very un- 
fortunate, because ordinary readers will refer to 
dictionaries for definitions of words they do not 
understand, and naturally will accept what is found 
there as correct. 

It is to be presumed that lexicographers, in defin- 
ing Shakespearean words, consult the works of spe- 
cial students ; therefore the specialists must be con- 
sidered the prime authorities. Have the specialists 
habitually selected the most profitable and reason- 
able starting-point for their word-studies ? A very 
interesting and entertaining phase of Shakespeare's 
writing is the abandon with which he uttered seem- 
ing solecisms, this fact having led to some strange 
misunderstanding of the spirit in which it was done, 
and to destructive criticism, on the score of care- 
lessness, of some of his grandest work. Thus, Mr. 
White attributes to Shakespeare a habit of writing 
carelessly, in frequent foot-notes such as " heedlessly 
written," " one of S.'s many reckless twists of lan- 
guage," etc. For instance, in " The Two Gentlemen 
of Verona," act ii., scene 7, is the following : 
" Lucetta. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire, 

But qualify the fire's extreme rage, 

Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason. 

Julia. The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns." 

Mr. White's note on this is : " the more it burns. 
An example of S.'s carelessness, followed by one of 
the most charming and exquisitely written passages 
of his lighter style." Is not this rather an example 
of W.'s careless or unappreciative criticism? Hav- 
ing likened love's glow to fire, and spoken of con- 
fining it within bounds, the poet has Julia use the 
word "damm'st," as the monosyllable most natu- 
rally suggested by what has gone before, and then 



passes to the figure of a running stream, suggested 
in turn by " damm'st." Certainly this is not a re- 
sult of carelessness. 

The lexicographers class an astonishing number 
of word-uses as obsolete. When a word occurs in a 
way not immediately recognized as one of its familiar 
uses, the conclusion seems to be reached at once that 
it must stand in some old and disused sense, and a 
separate definition is made for it on that basis. 
Would it not be more accurate and scholarly to as- 
sign a current meaning wherever that is possible? 
Many of Shakespeare's words treated as obsolete by 
lexicographers are readily explainable as used in 
still current senses, in some cases by considering the 
phrasing as merely elliptical, and in some by slight 
extension or alteration of the wording of familiar 
definitions, without actual change in their purport. 

In " The Merry Wives of Windsor," act ii., scene 
2, Ford says to Sir John Falstaff, " Now, Sir John, 
here is the heart of my purpose : you are a gentle- 
man of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of 
great admittance." Admittance as here used is de- 
fined in Webster's " Unabridged " as " the custom 
or prerogative of being admitted "; Worcester de- 
fines it as " custom or privilege of being admitted 
to great persons "; the " Imperial Dictionary " says 
it means " the custom or privilege of being admitted 
to the society of the great "; the " Century " pre- 
serves the "Imperial " definition ; and Dr. Murray's 
" New English Dictionary " gives the definition, 
" the habit or faculty of being admitted." All these 
dictionaries say that the word in this use is obsolete. 
Webster's " Unabridged " and the " Imperial " give 
this quotation : " Now, Sir John, you are a gentle- 
man of excellent breeding, ... of great admit- 
tance." Worcester's quotation is the same, but with 
no mark of elision. It is a point of comparatively 
slight importance, but both elisions should have been 
noted, as they are in the " Century." All these lex- 
icographers seem to have been misled by what ap- 
peared to be an uncommon use of the word, and to 
have manufactured definitions accordingly ; while 
the fact is that this word is used in its common 
meaning, and the part of the sentence that needs 
explanation (if any is needed) is the two words of 
great. The passage means " a gentleman command- 
ing much admittance," and the quotation would be 
properly placed under Webster's second definition 
" Permission to enter ; the power or right of en- 
trance ; and hence, actual entrance." Mr. White 
had good reason for neglecting explanation of this 
passage, for it means exactly what the words say in 
their common acceptation. 

In the first act of " Cymbeline," fourth scene, 
Imogen says to Pisanio, speaking of Posthumus's 
departure : 

" Thou should st have made him 
As little as a crow, or less, ere left 
To after-eye him." 

Webster's " Unabridged " has no entry of after-eye ; 
the " International " says it is poetic, meaning " to 
look after." Worcester enters it as v. a. (verb ac-

tive), marks it obsolete, and defines it: "To keep 
one in view ; to look after one." The " Imperial " 
enters it as v. t, (verb transitive), defines it as if 
intransitive and as a living word, " to keep one in 
view," and has let instead of left in the quotation. 
The " Century " gives the word as obsolete, mean- 
ing " to keep in view." The passage means that 
Pisanio should not have stopped looking until Post- 
humus had gone entirely out of reach of vision, and 
" keep in view " expresses the object of the action, 
not the meaning of the verb, which is simply, as 
Murray correctly gives it, " to follow with the eye, 
to look after." Murray's only fault is that he says 
the word is obsolete, thus implying that it was once 
current. In fact, it was a nonce-word, and is as 
good now as it ever was, should one choose to use it. 
In the first act of " Measure for Measure," fourth 
scene, the Duke says to Friar Thomas : 

"And to behold his sway, 
I will, as 't were a brother of your order, 
Visit both prince and people ; therefore, I p'rythee, 
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me 
How I may formally in person bear me 
Like a true friar." 

Webster's " Unabridged," Worcester, and the " Im- 
perial " give as a separate definition of bear as an 
intransitive verb, " to act in any character, to 
behave," except that the " Imperial " omits " to be- 
have," and all mark it obsolete. None of the others 
gives the passage quoted. Worcester and the " Im- 
perial " quote 

" Instruct me 

How I may formally in person bear 

Like a true friar." 

Webster quotes in one line, " Instruct me how I may 
bear like a true friar." This similarity of treat- 
ment, with its absurd error, evidently arises from 
the fact that some editions of Shakespeare have the 
line without the pronoun me (probably because of 
misunderstanding the old reflexive form beare, a 
dissylable), but at least five editions, including the 
Riverside, give the pronoun. 

In the first scene of the second act of " King 
Henry VIII.," Buckingham says : 

" Go with me, like good angels, to my end ; 
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me, 
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice, 
And lift my soul to heaven." 

Worcester defines this word divorce as " the cause 
of separation," and Webster's " Unabridged " and 
the " Imperial " say " the cause of penal separation." 
Webster's " International " says " that which sepa- 
rates." All these works say the word in this use 
is obsolete. The word was never used, and never 
could be used, with the meaning given in these defi- 
nitions. That which is named in the passage is 
not a cause, nor an agent or instrument, but an effect 
caused by the stroke of steel, and the line is ellip- 
tical, " as the long divorce [of soul and body] of 
[that is, caused by] steel falls on me." Divorce 
as here used means just what the " Century Diction- 
ary " says it does, " complete separation, absolute 
disjunction," though a better, because more explicit, 



definition seems to be " permanent separation or 
disunion of things naturally united," in this case the 
body and the soul. Here the lexicographers had 
not even the excuse of real unfamiliar! ty for calling 
the particular use of the word obsolete, since it is 
identical with that in such an expression as " divorce 
of church and state." Any one who chose to write 
"the long divorce of," instead of "death caused by," 
would have the same right to do so, and the same 
expectation of easy understanding, that Shake- 
speare had. 

It seems clear that literal construing of literal 
passages, not only in Shakespeare but in all litera- 
ture, should be the first aim of commentators, and 
that it should be in keeping with the current lan- 
guage as far as possible. Of course Shakespeare 
and his contemporaries used many words that are 
not now used, and all of their now disused expres- 
sions should be explained in the light of their own 
time ; but the discrimination should be made much 
more carefully than it has been. 

Will the true spirit of literature be fully and ac- 
curately understood, in secondary schools or in uni- 
versities, or anywhere, until such evil results of mis- 
directed energy are eradicated ? Only one important 
example has been considered here, but the evil is far 
more extensive. For instance, how can a writer be 
accepted as final authority as a thinker who exploits 
such inaccuracies of thought as the assertion that 
" redness is the name of a color " ? G. P. Marsh 
said this in one of his lectures on the English lan- 
guage, and John Stuart Mill said the same thing 
of whiteness. The simplest common sense should 
preclude such assertions from being possible to any 
one, especially to a logician. Some way must be 
found to make them impossible if we are ever to 
enjoy really accurate literary scholarship.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MR. STEPHEN CRANE AND HIS CRITICS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It really requires some courage to confess it, but I 
was one of the first English reviewers to whose lot fell 
the reviewing of Mr. Stephen Crane's book, " The Red 
Badge of Courage." Worse still a quite damning fact, 
I fear I even ventured to praise it. Mr. Crane I had 
never heard of when his book came to me in the ordi- 
nary course of business, but I read the volume with the 
greatest interest; I thought & in many ways a remark- 
able performance, and I did my best to give reasons for 
the faith that was in me. But apparently it is a subtle 
insult for an Englishman to praise an American book. 
I used to think that a good book was a good book the 
whole world over. It is only since landing in this coun- 
try and picking up THE DIAL of April 16 that I have 
learned better. Your correspondent, " A. C. McC.," is 
my authority. Now, I am truly sorry that any criticisms 
of mine or of my brother reviewers in London should 
have so annoyed your correspondent, for he evidently 
was very much annoyed. He came out on the warpath, 



298 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



arrested Mr. Crane as a literary spy, court-martialled 
him, and shot the poor fellow off-hand. 

This book, says " A. C. McC." in effect, cannot be a 
good one for Americans to read because the English 
have praised it. He puts the whole thing in a nutshell, 
you see. This English praise, he is convinced, is a Gre- 
cian gift. I personally thought I was merely pointing 
out the merits of what seemed to me a book that de- 
served some notice. But he saw the ambush we English 
reviewers were laying. Deep under our affected enthusi- 
asm for this young writer was an intense desire to insult 
America. It sounds oddly, does n't it ? But he has 
chapter and verse to prove it. He comes across some 
cruel, senseless gibes at the Union soldiers in " Black- 
wood's Magazine." They are over thirty years old, and 
to-day, from one end of England to the other, you could 
not find a man to express anything but the bitterest 
shame of them. But what of that ? " There," exclaims 
A. C. McC." exultantly, " that is why these English 
are praising Stephen Crane. The hero of his book is a 
coward. Thirty years ago an ignorant British maga- 
zine talked of 'the swift-footed warriors of Bull's Run.' 
Do n't you see the connection ? It is all a deep-laid 
plot to throw mud at American soldiers." To be sure! 
And so when I sat, pipe in mouth, a peaceable, jaded 
reviewer, happy to have come across a book above the 
dull dead level, my mind was really full of schemes for 
avenging Bunker's Hill! 

Your correspondent's letter is a compound of mis- 
judged patriotism and bad criticism. Take only these 
two sentences. "The book," he says, "is a vicious 
satire upon American soldiers and American armies." 
" Respect for our own people should have prevented its 
issue in this country." A curious attitude to take up 
towards a book, unworthy of an American, as it seems 
to me, and peculiarly unworthy of an American who, as 
I hear, fought through the war with distinction. I will 
say at once that no such idea ever presented itself to a 
single Englishman into whose hands the book fell. The 
most insignificant thing about the book, the one point 
which every sensible reviewer would at once dismiss 
from his mind as quite immaterial, is the fact that the 
hero fought for the North. If he had been an English- 
man in the ditches before Sebastopol, or a Frenchman at 
Sedan, the book would have been just as remarkable, and 
the praise of the English journals no less warm. But 
to " A. C. McC." Mr. Crane's one unforgivable crime 
lies in portraying a Northerner who fled from the field. 

Scarcely less wrong-headed is your correspondent's 
criticism of the book as a piece of literature. He has 
missed the whole point of the tale. Part of Mr. Crane's 
plan, I take it, was to give an idea of the impressions 
made on a raw recruit by the movements of a regiment 
in battle. Who can doubt that to a man who but yester- 
day was working at the plough the whole thing appears 
one intolerable confusion ? As for the style in which 
the book is written, "A. C. McC." finds in it " an entire 
lack of any literary quality." Mr. Crane, once more, 
is an author " utterly without merit." No half-measures 
with A. C. McC." Again quotations are at hand. De- 
tached sentences are given, and anything disapproved 
of is italicised. The odd part about it is that most of 
the expressions thus crucified seem to me admirable and 
picturesque. That there is a youthful and occasionally 
reckless daring about some, is true enough. But on the 
whole I am prepared to back Mr. Crane's sense of lan- 
guage against " A. C. McC.'s." 

However, I am concerned little here with the merits 



of Mr. Crane's work. The book can take care of itself 
quite well. I was surprised at " A. C. McC.'s " singular 
criticisms, and thought that a few words from " the other 
side " might be fairly called for. SYDNEY BROOKS. 
Chicago, May 9, 1896. 

JOURNALISTIC AUTHORITIES ON ENGLISH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the February " Bookman," Mr. Richard Burton 
reproaches Mr. Robert Barr for his heterodoxies on 
shall and will. Mr. Burton pronounces the philosophy 
of the auxiliaries as simple as the familiar table he gives ; 
but Mr. Burton is apparently ignorant that this table 
leaves out all the real difficulties and most of the import- 
ant doctrine. Questions and dependent sentences of the 
various forms comprehend most possibilities of violat- 
ing the accepted cauons; and Mr. Burton's confidence 
is evidently based mainly on deficient understanding of 
the scope of his subject. 

Again, Mr. Burton tells us that the differences be- 
tween shall and will have been " perpetuated and 
adorned by the choicest and happiest writers for some 
six hundred years." On the other hand, authorities like 
Matzner, Abbott, Latham, Emerson, and Kellner, tell us 
that the distinction is of very recent origin and of not 
invariable demarcation; and the testimony of Blackburn's 
capital study is in substantial harmony with their views. 
Shakespeare and King James's translators certainly 
lived less than six hundred years ago, yet they did not 
succeed in mastering " the very different shadings of 
these auxiliary words." 

Finally, Mr. Burton does " not hesitate to say cate- 
gorically that no great English stylist can be mentioned 
who does not uniformly prove himself a master of the 
very different shadings gained by the proper handling 
of these auxiliary words." We have already been 
forced to expel Shakespeare and King James's transla- 
tors from the fold of " choicest and happiest writers " : 
now we must exclude from the number of " great En- 
glish stylists " various impostors who have so long hyp- 
notized critics. Stevenson is by no means an uncommon 
offender in this particular, in spite of Mr. Burton's 
eulogistic exemption; while Arnold, Ruskin, Brooke, 
Hughes, Myers, Eliot, Symonds, Newman, Thackeray, 
Dickens, Lytton, also forfeit their claim, not necessarily 
to general good behavior, but absolutely to impeccabil- 
ity : not one of them is " faultily faultless " ; every one 
of them is at times guilty of a mishandling that, accord- 
ing to Mr. Burton, " bespeaks the lack of literary expe- 
rience." I hold myself ready to furnish citations to 
doubters. 

Why the " Bookman " should allow its limited space 
to be used by Mr. Barr and Mr. Burton for such pur- 
poses, I cannot divine, any more than I can pretend to 
estimate what Mr. Burton risks in his categorical asser- 
tions. Mr. Burton certainly has a very superficial knowl- 
edge of shall and will, of the development of English 
usage, of the diction of English stylists; and perhaps 
that is the very reason why, in an age that has abjured 
the last superstitions of noble minds the divine right 
of kings, verbal inspiration, papal infallability, and the 
innate superiority of woman alike he "perpetuates 
and adorns " an impossible fetich. There is, neither in 
instinct nor in self-conscious analytical explanation, any 
such guarantee of immunity as Mr. Burton's optimism 
assumes. The writers above specified do not, it is true, 
exemplify to a very trying extent the American and 
the Keltic tendency towards "I will" for "I shall," 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

though they do at times exemplify it too far to jus- 
tify proximate infallibility; but they freely use "I 
would " for " I should," " will you " for " shall you," 
while " would " is by them used almost indifferently 
with " should " or to its supersedure, in certain forms of 
dependent sentence. 

Apropos of the " Bookman " and English, that jour- 
nal's April inquiry of the Poet Laureate illustrates the 
difficulty of getting and keeping any faith once de- 
livered to any saints. The " Bookman " asks the Lau- 
reate to give the construction of " seat " in " who was 
given a seat " a point, another point, of sympathetic 
contact with the " Sun." A college professor of Latin 
ought to find commonplace the conversion of dative with 
active to subject with passive, the accusative remaining 
a phenomenon which has been immemorial in En- 
glish. (See Gil. L. G., p. 152, bot.; Good. Gk. Gr., 
1236; Kellner, Eng. Syntax, pp. 93, 225; Mason, Eng. 
Gram., 187; Whitney, Essentials, 305; Maatzner 2, 
212.) A common example is " He was asked a ques- 
tion " from " I asked him a question," him being orig- 
inally dative. Matthew Arnold says (Letters, Vol. 2, 
p. 403) " / was shown the Green River ": Button (Con- 
temp. Thought, 2, 264), "a mediaeval saint is given 
credit": Hampole (ap. Kellner, p. 226). " I fand Jesus 
gyffene galle to drinke ": Stevenson (Virg. Puer., p. 96) 
" these persons had been whispered the promise ": Andrews, 
E. B. (Hist. U. S., I., 134), " all felonies were awarded 
capital punishment." Examples can be multiplied indefi- 
nitely from all ages and forms of English, for the con- 
struction is natural and unimpeachable, in spite of the 
" Bookman's " ignorance ; and " it is so," even though we 
fail to see in the " Sun " or elsewhere " in our midst." 
The " Sun " indeed goes so far with its misapplied preju- 
dices as to deny the validity of " Mr. Reed was presented 
with a gavel," " merely because the gavel and not Mr. 
Reed was presented"; whereas the double construction 
of present has never, I believe, been questioned by any- 
body: verily, the veteran editor here stands so straight 
as to bend backwards. Yet, such is the irony of fate 
and the tendency of human nature to break out even 
amongst the Shakers as Artemus Ward puts it in 
his New Haven lecture on Lincoln, Mr. Dana is reported 
in the " Sun " as saying, " Now we are denied this right" 
an involuntary, and hence a more significant, tribute 
to the vitality of true doctrine. Indeed, not only is the 
construction sustained by the consensus of authority 
and illustrated by every natural writer of English, but 
(as Mr. Dana's lapse shows) it is hopeless to try to elude 
it: naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret.

As Professor Tolman's forcible " Word about Book- 
Making " in your issue of May 1 is particularly ad- 
dressed " to those who review books in the pages of THE

of Dec. 16 of the " Letters of Matthew Arnold " (a book 
justly cited by Professor Tolman as indicating some lack 
on its editor's part of " the index-making conscience ") 
closes with a devout prayer that " subsequent editions "

tents and an index." jj. G. J.

LIFE AND LETTERS OF DR. HOLMES.* 

Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes says somewhere, 
touching a class of authors who have been sar- 
castically charged with arming the King of 
Terrors with a new sting for eminent people, 
" I should like to see any man's biography with 
corrections and emendations by his ghost. . . . 
Just imagine the subject of one of those extra- 
ordinary fictions called biographies coming back 
and reading the life of himself, written very 
probably by someone or other who thought he 
could turn a penny by doing it." Were it pos- 
sible for the Autocrat himself to revisit with 
critical intent " the glimpses of the moon," we 
venture to say his honored shade would find 
little to alter or seriously except to in Mr. 
Morse's delightful " Life and Letters of Oliver 
Wendell Holmes," now before us. Mr. Morse 
has given us a satisfactory biography and a 
rarely entertaining book as well despite the 
fact that the career he depicts was, as he says, 
outwardly so uneventful " that the utter absence 
of anything in it to remark upon became in 
itself remarkable." Dr. Holmes, as we know, 
in his youth spent two years abroad as a med- 
ical student, and he revisited Europe for three 
months in his old age ; these were the only 
marked aberrations from the narrow orbit of 
a tranquil professional and literary life passed, 
one may say, in the shadow of that State House 
which one of his characters, with a cheerful 
and abiding faith in things Bostonian, styles 
" the hub of the solar system." The Doctor's 
life was entirely that of the private citizen. 
Unlike many contemporary men of letters, he 
never shone, nor sought to shine, in politics ; 
he never held, nor " ran for," any office ; he 
resisted the efforts made to draw him into a 
more militant part in the political struggles 
which resulted in the abolition of slavery ; less 
justly perhaps than any of his illustrious friends 
could he, recalling the stirring events of his 
time, have added, "Et quorum pars magnafui." 

The autobiography upon which Dr. Holmes 
is pretty generally supposed to have been en- 
gaged for some time prior to his death dwindles 
in point of fact into some scattered notes and 
memoranda, mainly early reminiscences jotted 
down at odd moments, without method, connec- 
tion, or revision. These occupy a chapter of

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



some twenty odd pages in the present work, 
and Mr. Morse has wisely printed them almost 
intact. They are sprinkled with allusions to 
the writer's old bugbear, Calvinism, and con- 
tain some amusing memories of the clergymen 
with whom his father used to exchange pulpits. 
These clergymen he divides into two classes : 
pleasant men (if a trifle weak in the theolog- 
ical joints), with a cheerful look and smile in 
spite of its being the Sabbath day ; and men 
of grim and dejected mien whose presence lent 
additional gloom to the Puritan Sunday, and 
who preached, as they phrased it, " as dying 
men to dying men." 

" To one of the most distinguished leaders of the Or- 
thodox party I had an instinctive dislike from early 
childhood. I was told that I laughed when I went to 
church and heard him preach. I remember upsetting 
his inkstand, which left a very black spot in my mem- 
ory. Another had a twist in his mouth that knocked 
a benediction out of shape, and proved afterwards to 
have a twist in his morals of a still more formidable 
character." 

As to his early reading, the Doctor says : 
" I read few books through. I remember writing on 
the last page of one that I had successfully mastered, 
perlegi, with the sense that it was a great triumph to 
have read quite through a volume of such size. But I 
have always read in books rather than through them, 
and always with more profit from the books I read in 
than the books I read through j for when I set out to 
read through a book, I always felt that I had a task be- 
fore me, but when I read in a book it was the page or 
the paragraph that I wanted, and which left its impres- 
sion and became part of my intellectual furniture." 

Pope's Homer was his prime favorite. 

"... To the present time the grand couplets ring 
in my ears and stimulate my imagination, in spite of 
their formal symmetry, which makes them hateful to 
the lawless versifiers who find anthems in the clash of 
blacksmiths' hammers, and fugues in the jangle of 
sleigh-bells." 

Of another book which was early put in his 
hands the Doctor observes : 

" Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress' that wonderful 
work of imagination, with all its beauty and power 
seemed to me then, as it does now, more like the hunt- 
ing of sinners with a pack of demons for the amusement 
of the Lord of the terrestrial manor than like the ten- 
der care of a father for his offspring. ... It represents 
the universe as a trap which catches most of the human 
vermin that have its bait dangled before them, and the 
only wonder is that a few escape the elaborate arrange- 
ments made for their capture." 

What Dr. Holmes was and how he fared dur- 
ing his student days at Harvard and at Paris is 
chiefly to be gathered from two groups of let- 
ters (given by Mr. Morse in separate chapters 
in their chronological place in the narrative), 
the one group addressed to an Andover school 
friend, Phineas Barnes, the other to members 



of his own family. These early letters are 
mainly such as any clever young man with a 
good flow of wit and animal spirits might write 
under like circumstances. There is an occa- 
sional twinkle in them of the peculiar humor of 
the future " Autocrat," and one is even led to 
suspect that there was a certain tincture of the 
ways of " the young fellow called John " in the 
Doctor's youthful make-up. Indeed, Mr. Morse 
admits (rather gingerly) that his distinguished 
relative had always " a considerable infusion of 
the ' sporting man ' in his composition." He 
was for years a zealous boating man, and 
boasted a small fleet of his own (including a 
" shell ") on the Charles River ; he owned to a 
penchant for the " ring," possessed the " Box- 
iana " prints, and has preserved more than one 
doughty modern Entellus in the amber of his 
racy prose ; he loved a good horse (one of his 
most cherished European memories was that he 
saw "Plenipotentiary" win the Derby), was 
learned in equine matters, and used to say, when 
a young physician, that what he liked best 
about practising medicine was that " he had to 
keep a horse and chaise." Mr. Morse draws 
an amusing picture of the young practitioner 
charging about the country in this ambitious 
vehicle a "one-hoss-shay," apparently, of the 
type of the Deacon's masterpiece : 

" In one of the clumsy great vehicles of that day, 
swung upon huge C springs, vibrating in every direction, 
the little gentleman used to appear advancing along the 
road, at once in peril and a cause of peril, bouncing inse- 
curely upon the seat, and driving always a mettlesome 
steed at an audacious speed." 

Dr. Holmes, as we know, won no marked suc- 
cess as a practising physician. His reputation 
as " a gay young fellow," as a jester (he an- 
nounced to his prospective clients that their 
" smallest fevers would be thankfully re- 
ceived"), and still more as a poet (he recklessly 
published a book of poems at the outset of his 
medical career), were at first sorely against 
him ; and he soon drifted to the academic side 
of his profession. Here, his influence for good 
must have been, as an English writer observes, 
incalculable. Thoroughly versed in the theory 
and practice of his calling, of keen insight into 
facts, alert, kindly, sympathetic, gifted with 
rare power of concise, racy expression, and of 
singular personal charm, it is indeed difficult 
to conceive of a man more fitted to shine in the 
role of teacher. Mr. Morse does full justice, in 
an interesting chapter studded with tributes 
from ex-pupils and former co-workers, to Dr. 
Holmes's academic labors and services. To 
teach something thoroughly was his ideal. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

" Smatterings, and the conceit of half knowledge, 
were odious to Dr. Holmes ; and as in this country they 
rise to the dignity of a national characteristic, he had to 
wage unresting war against them. He said: Our Amer- 
ican atmosphere is vocal with the flippant loquacity of 
half knowledge. We must accept whatever good can 
be got out of it, and keep it under as we do sorrel and 
mullein and witchgrass, by enriching the soil, and sow- 
ing good seed in plenty; by teaching and good books, 
rather than by wasting time in talking against it. Half 
knowledge dreads nothing but whole knowledge." 

In the spirit of the foregoing, Dr. Holmes 
used to express an indignant contempt for the 
notion, once prevalent, and now mildly recrud- 
escent in the form of a pseudo-literary fad, that 
a proper way of showing " American independ- 
ence of England " was to forswear " good En- 
glish " in speaking and writing, and affect an 
unwashed dialect, " redolent of the soil " and 
patriotically free from the taint of a mean sub- 
servience to " foreign models." Mr. Morse 
recalls " once hearing a gentleman of some 
reputation in literature say actually in ad- 
dressing the Board of Overseers of a distin- 
guished seat of learning that he did not ap- 
prove of teaching young men to write ' good 
English,' to use words accurately, and to con- 
struct sentences grammatically ; on the con- 
trary, he said that he wanted an infusion of 
the wild rough inaccuracies of the great new 
West ! " If Dr. Holmes were present on this 
occasion he must certainly have been seized 
with Charles Lamb's desire to " examine the 
gentleman's organs " if not to add a " bump " 
or two to the original quota. A writer in the 
" Quarterly Review " (cited by the author) says 
of the debt of American literature to Holmes : 

" When young America demanded that the political 
revolution which separated the Old and New Worlds 
should have its literary counterpart in a similar revolt, 
Holmes threw all his influence in the opposite scale. He 
urged with keen satire, as well as with the force of ex- 
ample, that even a Republic must recognize the laws of 
conventional decorum, and that those who enter the 
Temple of the Muses outrage propriety if they osten- 
tatiously flaunt their working-dress. To him as much 
as any other man we owe it, that the Versailles of 
American literature has not been invaded to a greater 
extent than it has by the vocabulary and manners of 
the < Halles.' " 

Mr. Morse discusses the literary side of Dr. 
Holmes's career intelligently and temperately, 
and wisely refrains from the attempt to fore- 
cast the exact place his works are destined to 
take in the future. Of the poems, he prefers 
" The Last Leaf," placing it in point of merit 
before " The Chambered Nautilus " to our 
thinking a somewhat doubtful judgment. " The 
Last Leaf " is perhaps the most unique of the 
poems, the one to which it would be most dif- 



ficult to assign a fair poetical analogue ; but, 
applying Matthew Arnold's test, do not the 
quaint, crisp versicles, half -playful, half -tearful, 
fall below such high and genuine work as this ? 

" This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign, 
Sails the unshadowed main, 
The venturous bark that flings 
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings 
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings, 

And coral reefs lie bare, 
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair." 

Summarizing his view of the poetry, Mr. Morse 
concludes : 

" There may, therefore, be doubt whether or not 
Holmes was a great, inspired poet; but there is no doubt 
at all that he was a charming singer, according to a dis- 
tinction which, it must be admitted, would affect the 
standing of some of the most delightful versifiers from 
the days of Sappho and Anacreon down to this current 
year." 

Dr. Holmes was anything but a voluminous 
correspondent, and his collected letters (not 
reckoning those interspersed by the author in 
his narrative) occupy scarcely two-thirds of the 
second volume. But if these letters are rela- 
tively few, they are of the first order in point 
of merit and interest ; and the reader will find 
their perusal a rare treat. The editor has con- 
veniently divided them into six groups : those 
addressed to Mr. Lowell, those to Mr. J. W. 
Kimball, to Mr. Motley, to Mrs. Stowe, to Mrs. 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, and " Miscel- 
laneous Letters." The group to Mr. Motley 
("unquestionably the Doctor's best," thinks 
Mr. Morse) indicate satisfactorily the state of 
the writer's feelings and opinions during the 
Civil War. We have already noted the Doc- 
ter's distaste for public affairs. His social and 
political conservatism, and his seeming apathy 
at a period when the organic national forces 
were plainly marshalling themselves for the 
" irrepressible conflict," were oddly contrasted 
with his alert progressiveness in other matters, 
and his constant readiness to do battle for his 
religious and scientific opinions. Calvinism and 
homoeopathy he attacked with a zest and vigor 
that savored of the pure gaudium certaminis ; 
slavery, the cardinal iniquity of the hour, he 
long seemed willing to dally with tentatively, 
expressing the opinion (1856) that "we must 
reach the welfare of the blacks through the 
dominant race " a notion " abhorrent to aboli- 
tionists." But when the war came, his attitude 
changed ; and he became, says Mr. Morse, 
" a strenuous, intense, often a greatly excited, 
patriot." In 1862 he wrote to Mr. Motley : 

". . . They begin to talk about the entente cordiale 
between this country and England as likely to be rees- 
tablished so may it prove ! Not that England can ever

be to us what she has been. Those sad words from John 
Bright's letter hare expressed the feelings that have 
sunk deep into the hearts of all (who have hearts to be 
reached) among us. ' There has been shown [us] no 
generosity, such as became a friendly nation, and no 
sympathy with [us] in [our] great calamity.' Those 
beautiful breasts of our ' mother ' country, from which 
it seemed that nothing could wean us, have shrivelled 
into the wolf's dugs, and there is no more milk in them 
for us henceforth evermore. The West end is right. 
Not by aggression, but by the naked fact of existence, 
we are an eternal danger and an unsleeping threat to 
every government that founds itself on anything but the 
will of the governed. We begin to understand ourselves 
and what we represent, now that we find who are our 
enemies, and why and how they would garrote us now 
that our hands are on these felons' throats, if they could 
paint a lie over so that its bones would not show through. 
I do believe Hell is empty of Devils for the last year, 
this planet has been so full of them helping the seces- 
sion liars. . . .

Hands off, and we '11 lick these fellows out of their inso- 
lent adjectives. We did lick 'em well at Mill Spring 
the other day, and at Drainsville a little before this, and, 
I myself entertain no manner of doubt, can whip them 
man for man at any time, in a fair field, picked against 
picked, average against average. We are the conquerors 
of Nature, they of Nature's weaker children. We thrive 
on reverses and disappointments. I have never believed 
they could endure them. Like Prince Rupert's drops, 
the unannealed fabric of rebellion shuts an explosive 
element in its resisting shell that will rend it in pieces 
as soon as its tail, not its head, is broken fairly off. That 
is what I think, I, safe prophet of a private correspon- 
dence, free to be convinced of my own ignorance, and 
presumption by events as they happen, and to prophesy 
again for what else do we live for but to guess the 
future in small things or great, that we may help to 
shape it, or ourselves to it ? " 

The following characteristic extracts from 
later letters to Mr. Motley (1870) need no 
comment. 

" Another sensation in a somewhat different sphere 
is our new Harvard College President. King Log has 
made room for King Stork. Mr. Eliot makes the Cor-

to the meeting of every Faculty, ours among the rest, 
and keeps us up to eleven and twelve o'clock at night 
discussing new arrangements. He shows an extraordin- 
ary knowledge of all that relates to every department 
of the University, and presides with an aplomb, a quiet, 
imperturbable, serious good-humor, that it is impossible 
not to admire. We are, some of us, disposed to think 
that he is a little too much in a hurry with some of his 
innovations, and take care to let the Corporation know 
it. I saw three of them the other day and found that 
they were on their guard, as they all quoted that valu- 
able precept, festina lente, as applicable in the premises.

In the meantime Yale has chosen a Connecticut country

in seeing how the experiment will turn out. . . ." 

The reading world has awaited these volumes 
with unusual interest, and they will disappoint 
no reasonable anticipations. The work is, all in 
all, the best of the several biographies of Amer- 
ican men of letters that have appeared in recent 
years. Taken together, the Memoir and the 
Letters form a complete and most engaging 
piece of literary portraiture one which the 
reader finishes with a gratified sense of having 
learned all that one needs know and has a right 
to know of the career and personality of the 
kindly "Autocrat." The publishers have shown 
taste and liberality as to externals, and have 
embellished the work with a number of excel- 
lent portraits of Dr. Holmes and his circle.

KOREAN GAMES.* 



Few American students have seriously stud- 
ied games. Among those who have Mr. Stewart 
Culin certainly ranks very high. To his energy 
was due the remarkable and interesting exhibit 
of the games of the world shown at the Chicago 
Exposition. Regarding this exhibit, he wrote 
a paper, published in the " Journal of Amer- 
ican Folk-lore," which was an excellent and 
suggestive bit of work. He has written a num- 
ber of other papers upon the games of Amer- 
ican children and upon games of the Chinese, 
which have appeared in various periodicals, 
government reports, and independent pam- 
phlets. The work before us, " Korean Games," 
is the most extensive he has undertaken. While 
the scope of the work is fairly indicated by the 
title, its full purpose is but partly set forth. 
The author says it " is intended not only as a 
survey of the games of Korea but as a prac- 
tical introduction to the study of the games of 
the world." Its incentive was due to sugges- 
tions made by Mr. Gushing, in regard to cer- 
tain North American Indian games. These pos- 
sessed some curious features which suggested 
new lines of study and comparison. 

Korea the Hermit Nation has been an 
almost unknown land. It is extraordinarily 
interesting in its conservatism. While it has 
been much influenced by Japan and profoundly 
by China, it has shown considerable freedom 
and independence. In its games, it betrays

versity of Pennsylvania.

these influences from outside ; at times it also 
shows notable originality ; in some cases it ap- 
pears to have conservatively kept nearer to old, 
original forms than the other two countries. 
On the whole it may be said that the similarity 
between the games of Korea and China is 
greater than between those of Korea and Japan. 

The toys of children are curiously alike the 
world over. The little figures that are weighted 
so as to stand upright interest Korean children 
as they do our own. Kites are great favorites 
in Korea, but are relatively simple. They are 
usually rectangular in form, with a circular 
hole in the middle, and are made of colored 
paper spread upon a bamboo frame. They pre- 
sent no such variety in form as in China, or even 
as in Japan. Curiously, however, the Koreans 
assert that " the Chinese do not know how to 
fly kites." The season for kite-flying closes in 
Korea with the first half of the first month. At 
the end of the season kites are sent adrift after 
wishes that the year's misfortunes may go with 
them have been written upon them. While 
"kite fighting" or "kite cutting" is practiced in 
all three of the countries, Korea, China, and Jap- 
an, it seems to be particularly in vogue in Korea. 

It is interesting to find that the little " her- 
mits " delight in a hand-clapping game with a 
rhythmic formula, very like our own " Beans 
porridge hot." In Korea, too, we find that old 
game oh, so old of two players simulta- 
neously throwing fingers and guessing the sum 
thrown by the two. It is represented on Egyp- 
tian monuments, described in Latin authors, 
and played by Italian children today. 

There are in Korea surprisingly many games 
where chance decides who shall "pay the piper." 
Thus two boys buy candy ; each breaks his 
piece : he in whose piece there is the biggest 
cavity pays for both. Two boys buy cherries ; 
one agrees to take a certain number, say forty, 
in his mouth and separate the pulp and pits, 
without swallowing a stone : failure requires 
his paying for both lots, success secures pay- 
ment for his by the other. Many such tests 
exist. Pitching pennies appears to be quite com- 
mon, and it is stated that some ten or more ways 
are known. In some of the games there are 
quite elaborate rules. 

Everyone, who has heard of Korea at all, 
knows of the curious sectional or factional fights 
that take place at set times. Begun by little 
boys, they become free for all before they end. 
Stones are the weapons, and results are not 
infrequently serious. The city of Seoul is 
divided into five Pou (sections) Middle, 



East, West, South, North. There the faction 
fights take place between the inhabitants of 
these divisions. These section fights are really 
the old quarrels of savage tribes, jealous of ter- 
ritorial rights, surviving on as custom into civ- 
ilization. They exist, still more meaningless 
and less definite, among ourselves in the fights 
between different "gangs" of boys in the streets 
of our great cities. 

But the interest of Mr. Culin's study cul- 
minates in the board games and matching 
games of grown people. The game of Nyout 
where a board is used, upon which is marked 
out a diagram, along which pieces are moved 
in accordance with a decree given by throwing 
marked blocks is a good and simple type of 
a large class of games. Among such games are 
pachisi (parcheesi), backgammon, etc. In 
Nyout, the path followed is a circle with two 
diameters crossing at right angles at the centre ; 
in pachisi, the circular path has been crowded 
down about and close to the cross-bars ; in back- 
gammon the cross-bars disappear and the circle 
becomes a rectangle. In all three the move- 
ment of the pieces is controlled by the throwing 
of dice or the dropping of sticks. 

Chess exists widely through the Orient. Chi- 
nese and Korean chess differ in some details, 
and Culin considers the Korean form the more 
finished and logical. Still, in the Hermit Na- 
tion, it is looked upon as a " frivolous pastime, 
suitable for young persons and rustics." 

Dominoes are practically the same in China 
and Korea. A common Korean game is quite 
like the Chinese fortune-telling with dominoes. 
Culin believes that dominoes originated in a 
system of divination by means of two dice. He 
also believes cards to have grown out of divin- 
ation. He says : 

" They are clearly copied from slips of bamboo, such 
as are used as divining lots at the present day in China. 
In fact, an almost exact replica of the Korean pack is 
to be found in the eighty consecutively numbered lots,. 
ts'in, used by Chinese gamblers to divine the lucky num- 
bers in the lottery called Pak-kop-piu. The latter re- 
tain the arrow-like tip, while the cards bear the arrow 
feather, and the names of both are almost identical with 
that of arrow tsin." 

As here suggested, our author believes the lot- 
sticks themselves to be derived from arrows 
used in divination ; the original divining box 
was, to his mind, the quiver. 

These bits, taken from the book here and 
there, suggest the interesting mass of material. 
In the introductory chapter are some important 
generalizations and suggestions. The two chief 
questions involved in the study of games are 



304

[May 16, 



origin and distribution. Mr. Culin believes 
that games have been, very largely, not con- 
scious inventions, but unconscious survivals 
from primitive conditions in which they orig- 
inated in magical rites and chiefly as a means 
of divination. We have suggested part of the 
argument above. Not alone in China and Korea, 
but also along our own Northwest Coast, divin- 
ation slips and gambling sticks have been copied 
from dropped arrows. In many games curious 
cosmic ideas are found. The Nyout board 
combines the cross of the world directions and 
the circle. The falling or divided arrows de- 
termine numbers. 

" A diagram upon which the counts are made allows 
the ascertaining of place. This diagram, whether the 
nyout circuit, or the eight or sixty-four diagrams, the 
pachisi cross on the chess board, invariably stands for 
the world. The cosmical import of game boards is often 
plainly manifest, but in none more clearly than in the 
Korean board forpa-tok, whose quarters are designated 
by the cosmical symbols. It is apparent in the divinatory 
games that the counts refer ultimately to people, and 
that the counters actually stand for men. In the pachisi 
board they are differentiated with the colors of the 
world-quarters." 

The book is beautiful in mechanical execu- 
tion almost too much so for a scientific book 
intended for use. The white cover, bearing the 
two-principles symbol in blue and red at the 
centre and four of the trigrams at the corners in 
blue, presents a striking appearance. Twenty- 
two full-page plates, in color, reproduced from 
original Korean paintings, represent games in 
progress. A large number of cuts from Jap- 
anese originals are scattered through the text.

I^ouis AGASSIZ.* 

The secret of Agassiz's power is suggested in 
these words of Thoreau : " There is no hope for 
you unless the bit of sod under your feet is the 
sweetest to you in this world in any world." 
The very fact of being alive was to Agassiz joy 
enough. To be alive here and now, with all 
these charming people, this bright sunshine, 
this blue sky, the green grass and clear waters, 
and above all this noble work to do, this in- 
deed was a condition meet for the gods. With 
" health and a day " he could, with Emerson, 
" put the pomp of emperors to shame." The 
power to enjoy and to use the present was the

Marcou. In two volumes, illustrated. New York : Macmillan 
&Co. 



secret at once of Agassiz's personal charm, his 
power as a teacher, and his success as an inves- 
tigator. In this tremendous optimism, the op- 
timism of the man who fears nothing, shrinks 
from no effort, and knows no despair, Agassiz 
stands unique among men of science. " When 
surrounded by material difficulties he fortified 
his spirit by a marvellous power of always 
hoping for better times, having an absolutely 
unshaken confidence in himself." " Blood runs 
quick in his veins," said Lowell, " and he has 
the joy of animal vigor to a degree rare among 
men a true male in all its meaning." In his 
youth Agassiz writes to his father that his aim 
is to be " a good son, a good citizen, and the 
first naturalist of his time," and that he feels 
within him " the strength of a whole generation 
to work towards this end." In his manhood, 
in whatever he did, as Darwin once said, he 
" counts for three." In his old age he hesitated 
not to begin work which it might take half a 
century to make effective. In all his life to his 
last words, " le jeu est fini," he was the same 
joyous, genial, sanguine enthusiast, a great, 
wise, overgrown, independent, eloquent, happy 
boy, with a boy's love for life, for the earth, 
and for whatever he could do with it. " The 
best friend that ever student had," is his worth- 
iest epitaph. Not less characteristic are these 
words of another student : " We buried him 
from the chapel that stands among the College 
elms. The students laid a wreath of laurel on 
his bier, and their manly voices sang a requiem. 
For he had been a student all his life long, and 
when he died he was younger than any of them." 
Agassiz was no type of the bookworm or the 
recluse. His thought was always joined to 
action, which is the normal conclusion to all 
thought. He recognized instinctively and to 
the full that the ultimate end of science is hu- 
man conduct. He had no likeness to Brown- 
ing's Grammarian, with his high and narrow 
aims which could not be translated into human 
movement and relations to men. In everything 
he did, Agassiz was accompanied by a trail of 
students, followers, and associates. He always 
thought, says Marcou, " that he had not enough 
friends or associates around him. His home 
was a sort of phalanstery of Savants." Failure 
was impossible with him, for his very boldness 
in facing the greatest difficulties without flinch- 
ing constantly brought him help from those 
who could appreciate the man, even if not fully 
understanding his aims. This was especially 
true in America, where over and over again he 
found rich friends who, as one of them said, 



1896.]

were " not willing to stand by and see so brave 
a man struggle without aid." 

One of Agassiz's associates, an early friend 
and fellow-student, brought by him from Swit- 
zerland to help him in his geological investiga- 
tions, was Jules Marcou. In his " Life, Let- 
ters, and Works of Louis Agassiz," Marcou has 
tried with great conscientiousness to give us a 
true picture of the man. In this he has had 
the advantage of a lifelong acquaintance and 
access to a great number of unpublished letters 
and documents. He had shared Agassiz's suc- 
cesses and failures, his successes being chiefly 
scientific, his failures chiefly financial. 

There can be no question of the fidelity of 
Mr. Marcou's efforts and intentions. In taking 
the volumes as a whole, the result is a marked 
success. In these books one cannot fail to see 
a clear picture of Agassiz as he was, rising 
above all their verbiage, their repetitions, their 
naive moralizations, and their still more naive 
exhibitions of prejudice. There are many sen- 
tences of Marcou which reveal forgotten per- 
sonal strifes and jealousies more interesting to 
the author than to the reader, and which might 
well have been left in oblivion. It is evident 
that had Marcou been in Agassiz's place the 
list of students and associates in his " phalan- 
stery " would have been reduced by more than 
half, and those who for reasons not always 
clearly given fail to meet Marcou's approval, 
are mercilessly scored. On the other hand, 
many who were rivals with Marcou in Agassiz's 
good graces are treated with a generosity usu- 
ally well deserved. For say what one may of the 
treachery of Desor, the snobbery of Forbes, or 
the uneasy vanity of several others, the great 
body of the Agassiz guild, both at Neufchatel 
and at Cambridge, were men in every way 
worthy of the master they followed. 

Marcou's work appears at its best when it 
deals with the scientific efforts of Agassiz, 
rather than with his own opinions. The latter 
are given with child-like simplicity which some- 
times drops into bluntness, as when he criticises 
Agassiz's family affairs or rebukes him for his 
familiarity with his assistants. 

Marcou's treatment of the subject of Evolu- 
tion is delightful in its simplicity. He can see 
nothing in the work of Darwin, Lyell, and 
Huxley but philosophical speculation. 

" Agassiz was unwilling to abandon the method of 
exposition of facts which he found established in science, 
and substitute in its place metaphysics and hypotheses." 

"Philosophical naturalists would find their task a 
very barren one if there were no classifiers, no embry- 
ologists, no paleontologists. It is very well to theorize 



and discuss teleology, agnosticism, spiritism, morphol- 
ogy, mimicry, natural selection, evolution, transformism, 
etc., but before everything else we must know the his- 
tory of every animal, of every plant, and accumulate all 
that constitutes the treasuries of every branch of nat- 
ural history." 

In one place Marcou drops from prejudice 
to slander, and in this he ceases to be funny. 
He says that Darwin's "Origin of Species" 
became a thorn in Agassiz's side. 

" His pupils in a body turned against him, for they 
were delighted to believe that they knew more than he 
of the philosophy of natural history, the descent of man, 
the creative power of horticulturists and of pigeon- 
breeders, and the mutability of species and genera. To 
the disgust of Agassiz, they turned from their master 
to applaud all the articles on evolution and origin of 
species published in American periodicals by Asa Gray, 
Chauncey Wright, and John Fiske, the last two not 
even naturalists." 

It is simply silly to affirm that such childish 
motives could have influenced such men as Le 
Conte, Hyatt, Scudder, Allen, Packard, Shaler, 
Brooks, Whitman, and the rest. It would be 
more true to say that these men followed to 
the letter the precepts of their master. They 
adopted as scientific truth the " working hy- 
pothesis " of transformism by Natural Selection 
and other influences only after all other con- 
ceivable hypotheses had ceased to work. In 
the light of the varied biological studies to 
which Agassiz had introduced them, they could 
not cling to the old notion of the special crea- 
tion of species and " look an animal in the face." 
The unique episode of the school at Penikese 
is well treated by Marcou. In plan and devel- 
opment this school was thoroughly characteris- 
tic of the man. It was the " little Academy " 
at Munich and the " Hotel des Neufchatelois " 
on the glacier of the Lauter Aar over again. 
Had Agassiz been in the prime of life it would 
have been more notable and fruitful than any 
of these earlier associations. As it was, we 
may still say that, notwithstanding all the rich 
streams of science which have since come to us 
from Germany, " the school of all schools which 
has had the most influence on the teaching of 
science in America was held in an old barn on 
an uninhabited island. It lasted but three 
months, and in fact had but one teacher. The 
school at Penikese existed in the personal pres- 
ence of Agassiz : when he died, it vanished ! "

THE TEACHING OF LATIN.* 



We feel sure that all progressive teachers 
of Latin are in thorough sympathy with the 
aim of Dr. Coy's new " Latin Lessons for Be- 
ginners," namely, to introduce the pupil early 
to good connected Latin reading and at the 
same time to give him a thorough knowledge 
of the common forms and simple constructions. 
After but eighteen lessons on formal grammar, 
including three declensions and the indicative 
mode of the four conjugations and of swm, the 
author plunges in medias res and begins Viri 
Romce. This is followed by Nepos' Life of 
Timoleon and by Caesar's campaign against Ver- 
cingetorix. We cannot help wishing that he 
had waited just a little longer so that systematic 
work in grammar might not be thrown out of 
joint quite so soon. We grant that the author 
has done remarkably well under the circum- 
stances, but the exigencies of the text neces- 
sarily divorce and unfortunately separate many 
grammatical facts and principles that naturally 
belong together. The author aims to overcome 
this by continuous quizzing on the preceding 
work and by many reviews. These will no 
doubt assist in binding together isolated facts ; 
but it must not be forgotten that young pupils 
are very slow to correlate and classify knowl- 
edge properly. To assist students in doing so, 
the book stands in great need of an index, for 
the material is so arranged that we fear they 
will often find great difficulty in referring back 
to some point to which inquiry has been directed. 

To develop reading power, the passages for 
translation are supplemented by short sentences 
based upon the text, in Latin and in English, 
for translation at sight. This feature is an ex- 
cellent one. We fear that some of the exer- 
cises, especially those in English, will prove 
too difficult, but the test of the class-room can 
alone decide that. Another commendable fea- 
ture is that after the seventieth lesson the spe- 
cial vocabularies under each are removed to 
the end of the book, that students may be en- 
couraged to read without them. Vocabulary 
is further fostered by frequent attention to En- 
glish derivatives and groups of kindred Latin 
words. It would have been well, also, to give 
more attention to word formation in the special 
and general vocabularies. 

In general the book deserves approval both 
for its plan and for the way it is carried out. 

* LATIN LESSONS FOB BEGINNERS. By E. W. Coy, Ph.D., 
Principal of Hughes High School, Cincinnati. New York : 
American Book Company. 



There are some matters of detail which we 
believe invite criticism. Among the most im- 
portant are the following : Dr. Coy states that 
" the long and short vowels differ only in the 
time occupied in uttering them," whereas it is 
reasonably certain that there was a difference 
between them in quality as well as in quantity,, 
most marked in the case of e, e, and o, 6 ; but 
also appreciable in the case of i, i, and u, u. 
Again, the accent of words is marked in all 
paradigms. This seems not only unnecessary 
but unwise. The laws of Latin accent are so 
simple that they can be very easily applied, es- 
pecially when the quantities are marked. Mark- 
ing the accent will lead students to neglect to 
note the quantity, which should be their guide- 
in determining it. With reference to quantity 
Marx has been followed, although his work has 
been already largely revised by an American 
scholar and is inconsistent with all Latin- 
English Dictionaries. 

The statement with reference to the future of 
the 3d and 4th conjugations (p. 36), the treat- 
ment of verbs in io, and of purpose and result 
clauses, seem quite unsatisfactory. The rule 
with reference to the declension of numerals 
(277, e) is obscure to say the least, neither is it 
clear how the statement that " the locative in 
the plural number has the form of the dative 
or ablative " (283, a) can be made to tally with 
the history of that case. The declension of 
trux is given (253) as the paradigm for adjec- 
tives of one ending, without is in the accusa- 
tive plural, though that is the more common 
ending for all that class. 

The author has been careful as a rule to ad- 
mit only essentials. We question the utility 
of mentioning the rare locative domui in the 
declension of domus, and of including the un- 
usual word gloriola in the list of words (263). 
We note a few inconsistencies : the explana- 
tions of natu maior, 89 and 144, do not agree r 
neither do the statements about the genitive of 
vis in 116 and in the vocabulary. There are 
also a number of slips of more or less import- 
ance, among them the following : vultum (141) 
is called a noun of the fifth declension ; fad 
for passive infinitive offacio (169); no infin- 
itive is given under the periphrastic conjuga- 
tions (212). 

The book is attractive in appearance and the 
proof-reading has been carefully done. It is 
to be regretted that there is no map of Rome 
and of Italy. The geographical notes, of which 
there are a number, are worse than useless 
without. B. L. D'OOGE.

SOME RECEXT EDUCATIONAL, BOOKS.* 

Miss Catharine Aiken's " Method of Mind Train- 
ing " is a slight book in truth its real substance 
might be put into fifty of its very small pages 
which details the author's devices in mental gym- 
nastics as used in her schoolroom. The strength- 
ening of attention was the chief object in view, and 
since attention practically equals intellectual effort, 
or study, or application, the real end coincides with 
the chief end of education. To get strong, accurate, 
quick attention, Miss Aiken saw that she must have 
sufficient motive or interest, and of the common 
motives fear, hope, emulation, curiosity, feeling 
of duty she relied mainly on emulation. By put- 
ting words and numbers on a swinging blackboard 
and allowing them to be seen but a few seconds, she 
stimulated competition in calling words and num- 
bers in their order, in spelling, etc. Miss Aiken 
does not appear to use " word-game," i. e., the giving 
out of a word from which to form other words within 
a limited time. This tests both vocabulary and 
spelling in a very interesting way. Many, however, 
will be disposed to criticize all such devices as un- 
healthy tours de force, as more or less mechanical 
reproductions, as mere tests of quickness which will 
discourage slower but often more solid minds, and 
as providing in emulation a low and unworthy 
method; and yet all must agree that Miss Aiken's 
methods are suggestive, and may with some minds 
be highly successful. 

In Mr. Charles W. Mann's " School Recreations 
and Amusements " we find much that we should not 
look for, and do not find much we should look for. 
Indeed, a large part of the book is concerned with 
mere formal exercises, as in gymnastics, or with 
direct pedagogical method. Further, much that is 
really recreation has little to do with school, as for

instance, swimming and tennis. On any strict inter- 
pretation of his title, about three-fourths of Mr. 
Mann's book is irrelevant. On the other hand, we 
fail to find mention of such distinctly school-games 
as " word-game," "geography-game," and "in-sight- 
and-unseen." Geography-game, played by holding 
up lettered cards, and asking for rivers, towns, etc., 
beginning with the letter shown, may be adapted 
to history and other studies. The spell-down and 
natural history collecting are also not mentioned. 
The loaning of pictures is not treated, nor yet the 
competitive finding of Latin words in English dress. 
"We notice that while the writer discourages geog- 
raphy rhymes, he tends to encourage history rhymes, 
which is hardly consistent. The book as a whole 
lacks newness, suggestiveness, and completeness, 
and at the best is only a passable compilation and 
compendium. 

The account of the public school system of On- 
tario by the Hon. G. W. Ross will be found of inter- 
est and value in many respects to us who dwell in 
" the States." In some ways Ontario's system is 
certainly superior to ours, as in its greater unity and 
centralization, its general inspectorship, and in the 
publication of school books by the central provincial 
authority ; but it is inferior in that it gives Roman 
Catholics their own public schools. The appendix 
on sanitation in rural schools shows some curious 
and suggestive statistics. 

Next on our list we have three Froebel books. 
" Froebel's Gifts " and " Froebel's Occupations " are 
manuals which are well written and clear in expo- 
sition, and well fitted to serve their purpose in as- 
sisting mothers and teachers in kindergarten work. 
Both volumes abound, like most kindergarten books, 
with quotations and references, which must be ac- 
counted a defect in a manual. The third book, 
" Froebel's Mother Play," is poetically and music- 
ally the best arrangement that has been made. How- 
ever, Froebel could easily be improved on in making 
play-songs which should deal with the environment 
of the child to-day. For instance, the cuckoo song 
and the wheelwright song can mean nothing to the 
American child. We need two distinctly new books, 
one adapted to the child in the country and one to the 
child in the town. Further, the illustrations, being 
uncolored, small, and archaic, are not suited to the 
child of to-day. Froebel should not become a fetich ; 
it is time that kindergartenism got beyond him. 

Professor B. A. Hinsdale's " Studies in Educa- 
tion " consists of some twenty brief papers, mostly 
practical discussions of the timely sort, designed 
originally for teachers' associations and such occa- 
sions. Consequently, the style is oral rather than 
literary. A bundle of papers of this kind which has 
no continuous theme hardly makes a book in the 
strict sense, though each paper may have had by 
itself a certain practical value in connection with 
the occasion for which it was prepared. Perhaps 
the most interesting paper is that on Religious In- 
struction in the German Schools.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



by Dr. H. T. Lukens, aims to be a clear, full, and 
practical monograph for teachers. This implies, we 
think, that it should be thoroughly inductive in spirit 
and method, proceeding immediately from examples 
in actual school- room experience to the simplest 
generalizations and definitions. This book, being 
complex, general, and in style very dry, is far from 
this ideal, though it may compare favorably with 
similar treatises. Its defects are in some measure 
due to its Herbartianism. An unnecessary history 
of the psychology of association is given (pp. 39-43). 
Mr. H. Holman in his " Education " sets forth 
what he takes to be an original conception, namely 
a u pure science of education " deduced directly 
from psychogeny. However, the conception that 
education is but the application of the laws of men- 
tal development can scarcely be called new. Mr. 
Holman's mode of exposition may be original, that 
is, a chapter of psychology followed by a chapter of 
inferred educational principles. This order repeated 
often through the book tends to split up subjects 
and leads to repetition. It would have been better 
to treat each main principle in its whole extent with 
its psychological basis in a single chapter introduced 
by concrete illustrations, and a final chapter on inter- 
relation. Many points in Mr. Holman's book invite 
criticism, for example, his conception of educa- 
tion as purely intellectual (p. 20) and the stress he 
lays on repetition (p. 117). However, it is on the 
whole a meritorious work, and gives fairly well a 
large, judicious, and, in the main, sound outline of 
the modern doctrine of education. The material is 
well digested, although we have the common vice of 
pedagogical literature, over-use of quotation. The 
style is clear and direct. The Appendix should be 
Americanized. HIRAM M. STANLEY.

English scholars. Aside from Pollock and Maitland 
and Round, what students of England's history and 
institutions compare with Felix Liebermann or Vino- 
gradoff or Busch? Rudolph Gneist, who has just 
died, might be cited also, and the late Bishop of Ches- 
ter would be the only one who could wear his armor. 
In Felix Makower's " Constitutional History of the 
Church of England," the field of English church 
history is now occupied, and with that thoroughness 
characteristic of German scholarship. If there is 
any source, prominent authority, or article of value 
omitted, which bears even indirectly upon the sub- 
ject, a diligent search has failed to discover it. 
The bibliography appended to the work fills twenty- 
nine pages. The extent to which black-letter 
Latin tomes and other documentary sources have 
been not merely cited but used is remarkable. In 
view of the fact that the page-print is beautifully 
large and distinct, while the notes are clearly but 
finely printed, it will not be a rash assertion to say 
that one-half of the work is comprised in the notes. 
The minuteness of the writer's accuracy may be ap- 
preciated when we find him citing the preamble to 
the Constitutions of Clarendon, and then adding 
specific directions as to construction, of which this 
microscopic detail is an example : " In Stubbs, 
Select Charters, a comma is placed after sui, whilst 
that after aliorum is omitted." It seems strange 
to find so little upon Wiclif or the Lollords in such 
a history, but the work is strictly what it purports 
to be a history of the constitution of the Church of 
England. Of course such limitations bar it from 
popular usage, but for the serious student of eccles- 
iastical or civil history and institutions for the 
clergyman, the lawyer, and the university scholar 
the book is a veritable mine. It is written with 
unusual clearness and directness; the legal qual- 
ity of the writer's mind is observable throughout ; 
each page reads like a lawyer's brief. The book is 
admirably analyzed, a system of cross-references, 
in every case, making it possible to refer to collat- 
eral matter. There is nothing to indicate directly 
that the translation has been made by the author 
himself, but internal evidence points that way. 

Mr. MacKinnon's study in international history, 
" The Union of England and Scotland," is a very 
different sort of work from Mr. Makower's. The 
author lacks the calm temperament of a judicial 
writer, nor can he look at men and events as a third 
person ; for he is a Scotchman writing of his coun- 
try's history and not a German studying that his- 
tory as something of interest yet wholly apart from 
himself. It is to be regretted that the personal 
equation should so largely have influenced a book 
written from so much contemporary evidence, " in- 
cluding a large amount of new matter." Fourteen 
chapters recount the history of Scotland in the 
eighteenth century. The keynote is struck in the 
last chapter, "Nationality and the Union," which 
is the plea of an earnest Scottish patriot for wider 
recognition of the importance of Scotland as a mem- 
ber of the British Empire. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



309 



The recent parliamentary struggle for Home Kale 
in Ireland, the change of ministry, and the present 
intensity of English interests in Africa and the East, 
has obscured the humble agitation in favor of Scot- 
tish Home Rule, an organized movement since 1886, 
the aim of which is to secure a separate legislature 
and executive for Scotland, thus making a federal 
and not an incorporating union, which, it is argued, 
is more compatible with the interests of the British 
Empire. Let the author speak for himself ; the fact 
that the question has received such slight attention 
on this side of the water we hope will justify so full 
an extract as the following : 

" There is no reason why the project should be re- 
garded as dangerous, or necessarily impracticable. Take 
the case of the two countries situated as Scotland and 
England are. Both are possessed of ripe experience in 
the arts of legislature and government. Both have a 
vast interest at stake in maintaining that mighty Em- 
pire on which the sun never sets. Both are endued with 
intense national sentiment, along with a common pride 
in the achievements of the great men of both nations, 
who have contributed to build up that wide nation of 
imperial Britain. Both are impressed with the convic- 
tion that the united Parliament is overburdened with 
the weight of imperial and national questions. The 
necessity of subdivision of legislative labors is forcing 
itself upon the attention of all parties. Tentative en- 
deavors have already been made, with good results, in 
this direction. There can be nothing revolutionary, in 
the bad sense of that word, in agreeing to devolve on 
two, or, if Wales be included in the distribution of re- 
sponsibility, say three national Parliaments, the work 
that is at present so unsatisfactorily performed by one 
unwieldy body in London." 

The success of the German Empire in combining 
national and local legislatures with an imperial diet 
is cited as an example to England, after which Mr. 
MacKinnon concludes : 

" A priori, then, the case for national legislatures in 
Great Britain is not incompatible with the larger pa- 
triotism which we cherish as citizens of the greatest em- 
pire that the world has ever witnessed. . . . Let us ask, 
what the men who advocate Scottish Home Rule have 
to say in its behalf ? They affirm that a national par- 
liament at Edinburgh could meet the demands of Scot- 
tish legislation more efficiently than is done by the Brit- 
ish House of Commons. . . . They complain that Scot- 
tish legislation is jostled out of the running in the race 
for supremacy with English, Irish, and imperial meas- 
ures. . . . They object that Scotsmen are put to an 
enormous expense by the necessity of constant deputa- 
tions to London, by the cost of private bill legislation, 
and by appeals to the House of Lords. . . . This is not 
the sum of the Home Ruler's contention. He complains 
that Scotland is overtaxed in comparison with" England 
and Ireland, and that Scotland receives an inadequate 
return out of the British exchequer." 

Here a plea is entered for government support of 
Scotch as well as of English universities, and " finally, 
the argument based on nationality is a strong one." 
The author waxes indignant when he writes of En- 
glishmen, using the term " England " to indicate the 
United Kingdom, or even the British Empire : 
" This constant use of the term is entirely unconsti- 



tutional it is a transgression both of history and of the 
constitution, and shows that the conditions of the treaty 
of Union are becoming, to Englishmen, in an important 
respect, a dead letter. . . . The legal, ecclesiastical, and 
educational institutions of both countries were preserved 
as a distinct natural inheritance to the respective peo- 
ples. To speak of the English army, the English navy, 
the English Parliament, or, in the sense in which it is 
frequently done, the English people, is both bad history 
and bad constitutional law " (pp. 517-22). 

Professor Vincent's " The Age of Hildebrand " is 
an endeavor to present in a popular, yet scholarly 
form, the significant features of the great mediaeval 
movement terminated by the pontificates of Gregory 
VII. and Boniface VIII., and of which Hildebrand 
was the actuating personality. The treatment is 
not confined, however, strictly to the conflict of the 
Empire and Papacy for world-sovereignty. There 
are chapters upon the intellectual condition of Eu- 
rope at the time, upon the rise of the universities, 
upon the monastic orders. The hook is weakest in 
the treatment of purely political history. The influ- 
ence that the identification of the papacy with the 
Clugny Reform had in tending to make the papacy 
a universal institution ; the part that the Norman 
State in Italy, that Tuscany, that the Pataria played 
in the great duel ; the causes inducing the French 
interference in Italy and the results thereof, are not 
treated as fully as desirable. At times the author 
visibly errs, e. g. in his consideration of Gregory 
VII.'s conduct at Canossa. The pope did not re- 
fuse to see Henry IV. at once because he wished 
keenly to humiliate his arch-enemy; the case had 
been referred to Augsburg, whither Gregory was 
hastening, and he hesitated to adjudicate alone what 
had been reserved for the German synod. More- 
over, the Emperor did not stand " with bare feet in 
the snow, fasting and shivering in the icy wind . . . 
for three days," but merely for a few hours each 
day, warmly clad, too, beneath his penitent's garb. 
The moral sentiment of Europe would have revolted 
against a pope so inhumane. As to penance, Otto I., 
Otto III., Henry II., Henry III., and St. Louis had 
all been publicly flogged. The truth of this dra- 
matic episode at Canossa is that the emperor had 
beaten the pope at his own game and Gregory was 
in a quandary he did not know what to do, so that 
Henry was obliged to wait, meanwhile playing the 
penitent to prevail upon the pope. A valuable fea- 
ture of the book is an excellent bibliography. 

Sir Walter Besant's "Westminster" originally 
appeared as a series of papers in the " Pall Mall 
Magazine." They are the sketches of a man to 
whom history is a pastime and literature a profes- 
sion. No attempt is made to enter into the history 
of Westminster in the large sense of that word, as 
typifying that of Parliament, nor does he enter, 
strange to say, into the more limited field of the his- 
tory of the Abbey and its monuments, a subject 
which must have appealed strongly to him. Rather 
it has been the author's purpose to restore to the 
mind's eye the vanished palace of Westminster and 



310

Whitehall, and to picture the life of England's grand 
abbey in its services, its rule, and its sanctuary. 
The pages betray the enthusiasm which every En- 
glishman displays for the traditions and institutions 
of his ancestors. A charm of the book is in the sym- 
pathy displayed for the subject, redolent with sug- 
gestions of the Middle Age, the light of cathedral 
aisle, the color of windows, roseate and pearl, "twi- 
light saints and dim emblazonings." But Sir Wal- 
ter is a knight of the romancer's quill ; he does not 
dip his pen in Gibbon's ink-pot. When he tries to 
write sober-suited history, he has the naive quality 
of Don Quixote. His favorite thesis, that the Isle 
of Bramble was a thriving mart long before London 
existed, is the humble Spanish wayside inn trans- 
formed into a gorgeous palace. From the point of 
view of the bookmaker's art, the volume is a delight 
to the eye ; it is admirable in binding, clear of print, 
and beautiful in illustration. 

To those who can boast " claims of long descent " 
other than of Huguenot or Knickerbocker or direct 
Germanic ancestry, Elizabeth Hodges's " Some An- 
cient English Homes " may appeal with interest. 
The pages are profusely sprinkled with allusions to 
Lord This and Lady That. To be sure no one of 
them ever had any influence upon the political history 
of England, and their social history cannot be of the 
remotest interest save to the genealogist or the 
antiquary, yet what of that ? The book is not with- 
out interest, if it is without depth. Piquant descrip- 
tions of old English castle life, hunts, tennis tourna- 
ments, or stronger forms of rivalry, as the jousts, 
racy incidents and spicy anecdotes, enliven its pages. 
But "the boast of heraldry," so often repeated, 
finally palls upon the American reader, who will be 
likely to plunge into " Yellow Plush " to restore him. 

Mr. Inderwick's little book, " The King's Peace," 
is one of a series of works which aim to present the 
results of latest scholarship in a popular compass. 
It is clearly printed, neatly bound, well illustrated 
with old-time sketches and prints, and contains also 
some very nice and interesting incidents. But the 
first requisite for the scholarly presentation of his- 
tory is a scholar, and the author is no historian. He 
has no historical sense. He is a lawyer, and his- 
torians as such have next to no weight with him. 
He will gravely quote Coke against Stubbs, and Dug- 
dale or Selden in preference to Thorpe or Gneist. 
It is pitiable to think that any serious-minded stu- 
dent can entertain the remotest idea that the Com- 
mon Law may be of Druid origin, yet Caesar is 
cited as authority for this supposition ! Mr. Inder- 
wick is grotesque without being respectably pedantic. 
In regard to English institutions prior to the Nor- 
man Conquest, the light that is in Mr. Inderwick is 
darkness. As more modern times are approached 
the darkness is less intense, although the shadow of 
Coke and Blackstone obscures every page. If the 
author had been writing in jest, his book would have 
been brilliant ; as it is, it is neither law nor history. 
Fortunately the book can do little harm, for the 



veriest tyro in English institutions will detect errors 
on nearly every page. 

Professor Edward P. Cheney has contrived to 
make the usually prosaic page of a study in economics 
sparkle with interest in his most entertaining " So- 
cial Changes in England in the Sixteenth Century." 
One reason why he has been enabled so to do is the 
fact that he writes from the view-point of contem- 
porary literature, as well as from rent-rolls, tax lists, 
and parish registers. In writing of the Open Field 
System of agriculture, in which the field was divided 
into strips of an acre or half-acre in extent by 
" balks " of unplowed turf, he quotes Shakespeare's 
" Between the acres and the rye 
These pretty country folks would lie " 

which is a picture of an English harvest field as 
accurate as it is attractive. Pamphlets, sermons, 
old letters, prose and poetry, have been copiously 
drawn upon in order to present the influence of the 
Renaissance and Reformation upon the masses of 
the people ; the decline of the old English baron- 
age ; the rise of the Tudor Monarchy ; the expan- 
sion of commerce, and the increase of the precious 
metals. The sixteenth century was a period of transi- 
tion in England ; it was " a period of the growing 
prosperity of the prosperous and the utter misery of 
the poor," and the homely phrases culled from con- 
temporary writings are here combined to make a 
study in economic history which is at once scholarly, 
attractive, and unique.

BRIEFS ON NETV BOOKS. 

Helps for Commentaries upon Tennyson are 

the student multiplying so rapidly that the num- 

of Tennyson. ber bi( j g f aip to equal that Q f bookg 

devoted to the exposition of Browning. Tennyson's 
poetry, of course, is usually so lucid as to be self- 
explanatory, and does not call for the same sort of 
annotation that " Sordello," for example, requires ; 
but the range of his observation was so wide, and 
his thought so subtle, that some sort of assistance is 
frequently welcome, and even needful. Two books, 
intended to help the student to an understanding of 
the greatest English poet of our age, are before us, 
and may be briefly characterized. Mr. W. M. 
Dixon, the author of one of these books, calls his 
work " A Tennyson Primer " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
which is not the most happily chosen of titles. The 
literary " primer," exemplified by such admirable 
books as Professor Dowden's primer of Shake- 
speare and the primer of Shelley, published under 
the auspices of the Shelley Society, is a well-defined 
form of manual, and is not primarily intended to 
be read. It aims to present in compact and well- 
arranged form the chief facts concerning the life 
and works of the writer in question, and is in no 
sense an essay or a biography. Now Mr. Dixon's 
" Primer " is a very readable and suggestive little 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



311 



book, but really amounts to a literary biography, 
with a critical essay appended, and does not per- 
form for Tennyson the special service that a primer 
should perform. A book properly answering to that 
name would not, for example, give us a long his- 
torical disquisition upon the Arthurian legend in 
English poetry, nor would it include bits of anec- 
dote and fragments of correspondence. We have 
no serious fault to find with Mr. Dixon's work, ex- 
cept that it is like so many others in failing to do 
adequate justice to either " Maud " or the dramas. 
Mr. Dixon quotes George Eliot as saying, " Ten- 
nyson's plays run Shakespeare's close," and tells us 
that " such criticism is pestilential." Well, we are 
inclined to spread the pestilence a little by saying 
that George Eliot was not far from right. Perhaps 
the most valuable feature of this little book is its bib- 
liography, which occupies some forty pages, and is 
particularly rich in references to periodical literature. 
Unlike most Englishmen, Mr. Dixon has recognized 
to the full the importance of American criticism, and 
his list includes many references to THE DIAL, "The 
Atlantic Monthly," "Poet-Lore," "The Critic," 
and other American journals. Both in plan and in 
spirit Mr. Morton Luce's " Handbook to the Works 
of Alfred Lord Tennyson " (Macmillan) better ful- 
fils the purpose of a " primer " than does the work 
previously under discussion, although the bulkiness 
of Mr. Luce's volume deprives it of a claim to that 
modest title. It is the outgrowth and expansion of 
the author's earlier " New Studies in Tennyson," 
and presents us with a chronological commentary 
upon the poems. The work embodies a vast amount 
of research, tracing in much detail the sources of 
Tennyson's thought and form, explaining the diffi- 
culties, illustrating the poems by suggestive parallel 
passages from other writers, and illuminating the 
subject with a good deal of temperate and helpful 
criticism. It makes a book simply indispensable 
for the reader of Tennyson, and ought to come into 
general use wherever the poems of the last great 
Laureate are studied with serious purpose. Teach- 
ers of English literature will find it a valuable ad- 
junct to their work, and will cordially welcome its 
appearance. 

Prof. Raymond 1 ! Prof essor Raymond, in the preface to 
latest volume " Painting, Sculpture, and Architec- 
onJMhetics. ture ag Representative Arts" (Put- 
nam), expresses the view that some statements in 
THE DIAL'S notice of one of his previous volumes 
were founded upon very superficial reading. If he 
is right (and it may be questionable what Professor 
Raymond would call superficial) it seems to us to 
follow that the average reader, if he want to make 
anything at all out of the book, will be placed in a 
dilemma : either he will have to give a good deal of 
hard study to Professor Raymond's work, or he will 
have to acknowledge at the start that his author is 
a sufficient and adequate guide in matters of aes- 
thetics. How fit Professor Raymond is for this posi- 
tion will, we think, be obvious from a single exam- 



ple. If time permitted we would gladly give more, 
but we must confine ourselves to a minor point ; 
and with a view of indicating his method, we take 
his handling of the idea that the Gothic arch was 
suggested by branching trees in the forest. On page 
32, he remarks : " But suppose that, taking a sug- 
gestion, as the early architects undoubtedly did, 
from the way in which limbs branch out from tree- 
trunks, the wood and stone which the pillars sup- 
port are also made to branch off from them as in 
arches." It will be observed that the imitation on 
the part of the early arch-builders is undoubted. 
In spite of this substantiation of a historic fact which 
on page 398 becomes a simple truth, Professor Ray- 
mond on page 399 only goes so far as to write, " It 
is an indisputable fact that an avenue of trees with 
bending branches inevitably suggests to anyone who 
has seen it. [Reference to Beverley Minster and 
the Palms.] If it does so in our age to the ordinary 
observer why could it not have done so in the mid- 
dle ages to the first Gothic builder ? " Why, indeed ? 
And since it did, " is it not evident that when this 
has been done [/. e., the arches made to spring from 
the pillars] something has been done which adds to 
the representation of the mere conception of sup- 
porting strength, a representation of the same effect 
as produced by appearances of nature" (p. 32). 
It is not clear what effect is alluded to : if it be that 
of "supporting strength," we should say that such 
is not the idea produced in us by a spreading tree ; 
if it be the effect really produced by a spreading 
tree, i. e., airy lightness, which is also produced by 
good Gothic, we should say that airy lightness har- 
monized ill with supporting strength. Later we 
hear (p. 399) that those who deny that the branch- 
ing of trees might have suggested Gothic arches, 
" or ridicule, as they do, the statement that it might 
[of. above undoubted], would have difficulty in mak- 
ing most men believe that they could recognize any 
conclusion whatever attainable as a result of only 
logic or insight." Such is Professor Raymond's 
rigorous method. When such a thinker attempts a 
difficult subject, he may strike out some interesting 
ideas, but he rarely says the last word on the mat- 
ter. Professor Raymond's books have a good deal 
that is suggestive here and there, and this one has 
a number of illustrations which serve to make his 
points clearer. 

Afield Aeon's In his " With an Ambulance during 
experiences in the the Franco-German War " (imported 
Franco-German war.ty Scribners), Dr. Charles E. Ryan 
narrates his sufficiently stirring personal experiences 
and adventures as a field surgeon with both the con- 
tending armies in 1870-71. To those who would 
undertake the just now specially useful exercise of 
mentally realizing the hideous and coarsely prosaic 
realities which constitute nine-tenths of that alleged 
national need and educative disguised blessing called 
War, we cordially commend Dr. Ryan's book 
which, we hasten to add, is not weakened as a nar- 
rative by being written with any ulterior moral or

didactive purpose. Dr. Ryan is simply a narrator. 
An evil is often best shown to be an evil by the 
plainest and least argumentative statement of facts. 
Thus, we take it, no more cogent plea against war, 
or more damning indictment of its reckless advo- 
cates and promoters could be made, than this terse, 
vivid, and unassuming recital of Dr. Ryan's ; and 
were it within the bounds of human possibility to 
convert by moral means to humanity and right 
reason those " statesmen " whom a satiric destiny 
and a betrayed electorate have sent to Washington 
to guard the welfare and maintain the credit of this 
nation, and who have been discharging their man- 
date by doing their best to plunge us into war on 
this, that, or the other pettifogging pretext, we should 
earnestly commend Dr. Ryan's book as a tract suit- 
able for distribution at the federal Capital ; but, un- 
fortunately, nothing short of a strait-waistcoat, or 
the absolute certainty of being sent to the front 
should his barbarous clamor bear fruit, is likely to 
bring a Jingo politician in full cry to his senses. At 
the outbreak of the Franco-German war Dr. Ryan 
was a medical student at Dublin. A natural taste 
for adventure and a humane desire to be of service 
impelled him to set out for Paris, where he joined 
the Anglo-American Ambulance then organizing 
under the command of Dr. Marion Sims. The 
corps was at once sent to Sedan ; and here Dr. Ryan 
had his first taste of the horrors of war. One easily 
reads between the lines of the author's account of 
Sedan, as of later engagements, the prime cause of 
the swiftness and thoroughness of the French de- 
feat. As in the China-Japan war, it was a loosely 
organized mob of soldiery against a compact per- 
fectly-ordered fighting machine whose every move 
was a part of a coherent scheme ; and the issue was 
never in doubt from the outset. Bismarck and 
Moltke chose well the moment for striking the blow 
that was to consolidate the new German Empire 
and secure the primacy therein to Prussia. Dr. 
Ryan's narrative is by no means, what we may per- 
haps have incautiously led the reader to infer it to 
be, a mere surgeon's catalogue of horrors and cas- 
ualties. It is long since we have seen a more en- 
tertaining book of the kind.

of Southern France. 



"The Riviera : Ancient and Mod- 
ern " (Putnam), by M. Charles Len- 
fa^ a French engineer, will be 
welcomed by readers who propose to spend some 
part of the summer in southern France along the 
strip of coast extending from Marseilles eastwards 
toward Genoa. Though a scientific man with a keen 
eye for the fauna, the flora, the geologic formation 
and the climatic conditions of the Mediterranean 
coast, M. Lenthe"ric is a writer who shows marked 
power in description and unusual literary judgment. 
His method of treating the subject is peculiarly 
characteristic and gives an air of leisure to the vol- 
ume which is refreshing. As the author remarks 
too truly : ' A sea-voyage nowadays is a question 
only of time, seasickness, and money." Accord- 



ingly he asks the reader to accompany him slowly 
along the coast, preferring to travel in a small 
fishing-boat and thus to go from port to port past 
the sites of ancient Taurcentum, Toulon, St. Tropes, 
St. Raphael, La Napoule, Cannes, Antibes (the an- 
cient Antipolis), Nice, and Monaco; or to linger 
among the islands of Hyeres and the Le*rins, fol- 
lowing the course of Greek and Phoenician sailors 
of earlier times. But M. Lenthe"ric's plan allowed 
him to stop a while at most of the places to which 
we have referred, so that he has described the scen- 
ery of Maritime Provence, notably the gorges of the 
Este*rel, the surroundings of Fre*jus, and the lower 
valley of the Var. He has little to say of the Prom- 
enade of Nice or regarding the " rooms " of Monte 
Carlo such topics are matters of guide-book inform- 
ation. His interest is to some extent historic. Hence 
he speaks frequently of the Grecian colonies of an- 
tiquity within this region, and he traces out the 
work of Romans and Saracens, so far as these peo- 
ples left permanent influences upon their successors. 
The comments upon the present-day inhabitants and 
their industrial and social interests are cogent and 
often entertaining. Hardly once does the reader 
notice a trace of weariness on the part of the author, 
or any sign of the struggle which occasionally M. 
Lenthe'ric must have experienced while sifting the 
literary details for his brilliant sketching. The vol- 
ume is provided with plates and maps which make 
the journeyings clear. The translation has been 
made by Dr. Charles West of the Royal College of 
Physicians of London. 

Acmueimtom* In her useful Biographical study of 
biography of " Madame Roland " (Scribner), Miss 
Madame Roland. Ida M Tarbell gives us a full, faith- 
ful, and literal account of the much canvassed and 
usually misjudged career of the Girondin Egeria. 
As the representative of a faction and the type of a 
leading social, political, and intellectual revolution- 
ary class, Madame Roland has been alternately 
lauded and abused. To one school of opinion she 
is the saint and martyr : to the other the little bour- 
geoise, whose diseased vanity fancied a rival in the 
Queen of France herself ; the soured plebeian whose 
revolutionary zeal was born of hatred for those at 
the top, rather than love for those at the bottom of 
the social scale. As usual, the truth lies somewhere 
between the extremes. Let us say that Madame 
Roland was a high and puissant soul, whose loyalty 
to her ideal could harden nevertheless at times into 
a certain unwise and ignoble implacability ; a gen- 
erous dreamer touched with the pedantry of her 
time ; a Frenchwoman, with a large share of the 
national love of histrionic 6clat, and of the distinc- 
tion of a leading role ; a raw and incapable politi- 
cian for, admitting that she swayed the counsels 
of the Girondins, there surely was never a political 
party worse led than hers. Her crowning political 
mistake was her repeated rejection of Danton 
the Mirabeau of the populace, and with all his faults, 
the real Colossus of the Revolution, the man who,

allied with the Girondins and with Dumouriez, might 
hare saved France from anarchy. Miss Tarbell's 
book is not a mere revamping of facts in the life of 
Madame Roland which are already known; nor 
does it represent what may be termed the poetical 
method applied to biography. Her recital is terse, 
clear, and literal ; and her recent close researches 
among original documents, as well as her intimate 
acquaintance with descendants of Madame Roland 
now living in Paris, have enabled her to present 
some new facts that throw additional light upon the 
career and character of her heroine. Miss Tarbell 
has done her work patiently and conscientiously ; 
and she has resisted the common temptation to make 
Madame Roland the motife of a rhapsody, rather 
than the subject of a biography. There are a num- 
ber of illustrations, mainly portraits. 

Professor Sayce's " The Egypt of the 
Hebrews" (Macmillan), "isintended 
to supplement the books (on Egypt) 
already in the hands of tourists and students, and 
to put before them just that information which either 
is not readily accessible or else forms part of larger 
and cumbrous works" (Preface). The first four 
of the eight chapters of the book discuss " the pa- 
triarchal age," " the age of Moses," " the exodus 
and the Hebrew settlement in Canaan," and " the 
age of the Israelitish monarchies." The positions 
taken are substantially those found in the author's 
earlier works. Abraham's sojourn in Egypt (p. 20), 
Ebed-tob's letter to Egypt and his identification with 
Melchizedek (p. 71), the Pharaoh of the Exodus 
(p. 90 ff), are some of the points on which he agrees 
with his former utterances. These first four chap- 
ters add little or nothing to our stock of knowledge. 
But chapters V.- VIII. are vigorous presentations 
of "the age of the Ptolemies," "Herodotos in 
Egypt," " in the steps of Herodotos," and " Mem- 
phis and the Fayyum." They gather into brief 
compass the most salient points under each topic. 
Pioneer-work is always necessarily venturesome, and 
Professor Sayce even oversteps the bounds of law 
in this regard. He never fails to interest his reader, 
unless it is by recapitulating matter already in book 
form. Some valuable appendices on dynasties, on 
chronology and writers, fittingly close the volume. 
While perpetuating some of the author's proverbial 
guesses, this book may do a great good in clarify- 
ing the historical air of Egypt, and in righting our 
conceptions of Israel's relations to Egypt. 

Those who have read Mrs. Oliphant's 

The makers of ,, -. T-,, ., , .. .- , 

Modern Rome. Makers of Florence and " Mak- 

ers of Venice " know essentially what 
to expect in " The Makers of Modern Rome " ( Mac- 
millan), though the apologetic Preface forewarns 
the reader not to expect the author's best work. 
Here is brought together a quantity of interesting 
material from epochs of modern Roman history 
the close of the fourth century, of the sixth, of the 
eleventh, of the twelfth, the middle of the four- 



teenth, and from the middle of the fifteenth through 
the first quarter of the sixteenth material much of 
which is not easily accessible in a village library. 
Any secondary work of history, such as this, ought 
to give at least a brief list of its sources, as, in the 
first section, Thierry's " Life of St. Jerome." In- 
deed, the material of the volume is limited too ex- 
clusively to such works as those of Muratori, Migne, 
and the Bollandists. The share of Melania and 
Paula in making modern Rome does not appear to 
be great in comparison with that of Theoderick, 
Michael Angelo, or Victor Emmanuel. The con- 
tents of the volume on the whole would better de- 
serve the title " The Makers of the Papacy." Here 
are a few examples of a careless style to be found 
in the book : " Withdrawn into a villa had she ? " 
(p. 19) ; " the breach of all the decorums of life " 
(p. 29) ; " What more dreadful influence could be 
than one which made a woman forsake her child, 
the infant whom she had carried in her arms to the 
great funeral, in the sight of all Rome, the son of 
her sorrow? " (p. 32) ; " When every one else had 
tried their best" (p. 67) ; "And all the fault of 
the Pope, as who could wonder if the sufferers 
cried? " On p. 109 occurs a slip of mere careless- 
ness, " the terrible Alaric, a scourge of God like 
his predecessor Attila," which the publishers can 
correct in a new edition by substituting " successor " 
for " predecessor." Yet the book brings to the av- 
erage reader much interesting matter that is new, 
and with its good print and numerous illustrations 
deserves, and will probably find, many readers.

Ihree Other Farces (Harper), by 
that clever writer, Mr. John Kendrick Bangs. None 
of our other up-to-date humorists, we think, provoke 
quite so many laughs to the page as Mr. Bangs does 
and his fun is always cheery, wholesome, and 
decent withal. The "three other farces" in the 
book are : " A Dramatic Evening," " The Fatal 
Message," and "A Proposal under Difficulties." 
The four pieces are distinct from each other in plot 
and action ; but the same characters appear in each. 
In " The Bicyclers," " Mr. Perkins " takes his first 
lesson in " biking," while his friends watch him from 
the window. One of these, " Bradley," becomes 
anxious over the non-arrival of his wife, who is com- 
ing down town a-wheel, and who presently an- 
nounces by telephone that she has been arrested for 
riding without a light. She is finally bailed out, 
and the company retires to supper. " A Dramatic 
Evening" shows the tribulations of the good-natured 
" Perkins," who has rashly agreed to have private 
theatricals in his house, which is thereupon pulled 
to pieces in the usual harrowing way. " The Fatal 
Message " shows the final rehearsal of the play, the 
fun turning on the general " bulldozing " of the hos- 
pitable " Perkins " by his guests, and the final dis- 
covery that " Bradley," misreading a telegram sent 
him, has learned the wrong part. "A Proposal under

tion of proposing to her. In the main scene " Yards- 
ley," soltis, rehearses his impending proposal and 
is^rapturously accepted by the house-maid who hap- 
pens to enter at the critical moment. The " situa- 
tions " are ingenious, the dialogue is clever, and the 
fun throughout waxes fast and furious up to the 
denouement. The last farce, especially, strikes us 
as a capital one for private theatricals. The piquant 
drawings call for special mention. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The following German texts have recently been pub- 
lished: Storm's " Immensee," edited by Mr. H. S. Beres- 
ford-Webb (Maynard) ; " Legends of German Heroes 
of the Middle Ages," by Professor Johannes Schram- 
mon, edited by Mr. A. R. Leclmer (Maynard) ; " Fritz 
auf Ferien," by " Hans Arnold," edited by Mr. A. W. 
Spanhoofd (Heath) ; and three "Wissensehaftliche Vor- 
trage," by Emil Du Bois Raymond, edited by Dr. James 
Howard Gore (Ginn). We have also received a " First 
German Book," by Mr. M. J. Martin (Werner), pre- 
pared upon the inductive plan. Of recent French texts 
we note the following: " Pgcheur d'Islande," by " Pierre 
Loti," with notes by M. C. Fontaine (Jenkins); Augier's 
" Le Gendre de Monsieur Poirier," edited by Dr. B. W. 
Wells (Heath); M. Ohnet's "Le Chant du Cygne," ed- 
ited by M. Arthur H. Solial (Maynard) ; " Le Premier 
Livre de Franc.ais," by Miss Louise S. Hotchkiss 
(Heath) ; and a " Key to Short Selections for Translating 
English into French," by M. Paul Bercy (Jenkins) . 

The series of " English Classics " published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co., of which we have heretofore 
had occasion to speak in terms of high praise, is rap- 
idly growing. Four volumes have just been added to 
the list, and are upon the general level of excellence 
attained by their predecessors. They are Coleridge's 
" The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," edited by Mr. 
Herbert Bates; "As You Like It," edited by Messrs. 
Barrett Wendell and W. L. Phelps; "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," edited by Mr. George P. Baker; and 
" The Merchant of Venice," edited by Mr. Francis B. 
Gnmmere. 

We cannot recommend anonymous editions of En- 
glish classics, such as the texts recently published by 
the American Book Co., including "Macbeth," two 
books of " Paradise Lost," and DeQuincey's " Revolt 
of the Tartars." Anonymity in such cases usually 
means cheap labor and scamped workmanship. A word 
of praise may be given, however, to this firm of pub- 
lishers for their " Eclectic School Readings," of which 
two volumes, both by Dr. Edward Eggleston, are at 
hand. These books are entitled " Stories of Great Amer- 
icans for Little Americans," and " Stories of American 
Life and Adventure." They are simply written and 
attractively illustrated. 

Book lovers will take delight in a charming little vol- 
ume entitled " Reminiscences of Literary London from 
1779 to 1853 " by Dr. Thomas Rees, with additions by 
Mr. John Britton. The book was first privately issued 
about 1853, and is now reprinted and published in a 
very attractive form by Mr. Francis P. Harper (New 
York). It contains much curious matter respecting 



books their authors, publishers, and sellers written 
in a familiar style, and is, on the whole, very enjoyable 
reading. 

" A Metrical History of the Life and Times of Na- 
poleon Bonaparte " (Putnam), edited by Mr. William 
J. Hillis, is further described as " a collection of poems 
and songs, many from obscure and anonymous sources, 
selected and arranged with introductory notes and con- 
necting narratives." Mr. Hillis has been collecting these 
poems for many years, and found that he had at last " a 
poem for nearly every incident of note in the life and 
history of Napoleon, from his birth to his second fune- 
ral." The poems, together with the prose connective 
tissue supplied by the editor, and the twenty-five pho- 
togravure illustrations, make up a handsome octavo of 
more than five hundred pages. The average excellence 
of the work is not as mean as might hastily be imag- 
ined, for the names of Byron, Wordsworth, Campbell, 
Scott, Browning, Southey, Koerner, Praed, Whittier, 
Taylor, Hugo, and Manzoni are among those that occur 
in the table of contents. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



A long poem by Mr. Swinburne, having for its sub- 
ject the story of Balen as found in Malory, is to be pub- 
lished at an early date. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. will be the Amer- 
ican publishers of the " Letters of Victor Hugo," which 
may be expected in the autumn. 

"The Uncommercial Traveller" and "A Child's His- 
tory of England " form a new volume in the popular edi- 
tion of Dickens published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

The Book of Job," edited by Mr. R. G. Moulton, is 
now published in " The Modern Reader's Bible " series of 
booklets, with the imprint of Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

Volume III. of the Dent-Macmillan reprint of Carle- 
ton's " Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry " has 
just appeared, as has also, with the same imprint, a 
translation of M. Daudet's " Tartarin sur les Alpes." 

Mr. Alfred Ayres, whose little book called " The Ver- 
balist " has been found helpful by many literary workers 
during the fifteen years of its existence, has revised and 
enlarged the work for a new edition just published by 
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. send us new editions, 
cloth bound, of three of their works : " The Psychology 
of Attention," by M. Thomas Ribot; "Three Lectures 
on the Science of Language," by Professor F. Max 
Miiller; and " The Religion of Science," by Dr. Paul 
Carus. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish a fourth edi- 
tion of Symonds's translation of " The Life of Ben- 
venuto Cellini," in a single volume, with a mezzotint 
portrait, and a number of reproductions of Cellini's 
works. The volume is a handsome one, and the price is 
moderate. 

The first number of " The Portfolio " to deal with an 
American subject, since that valuable periodical became 
a series of monographs, is the quarterly issue for April, 
which discusses the work of " John La Farge, Artist and 
Writer" (Macmillan). Miss Cecilia Waern is the au- 
thor of this study. 

A beautiful edition of R. L. Stevenson's " Edinburgh,"

Messrs. Leach, Shewell & Sanborn announce for early 
publication a " New Plane and Spherical Trigonometry," 
by Professor Webster Wells, Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, and " The Story of Turnus " from the 
JEneid, VI. to XII., by Dr. Moses Slaughter, Iowa Col- 
lege. In the early summer the same firm will issue a 
new " Greek and Roman Mythology," by Dr. Herbert C. 
Tolman of Vanderbilt University, and Professor Karl P. 
Harrington, University of North Carolina. 

Mr. Henry Cuyler Bunner, who died on the eleventh 
of this month, at the age of forty, will be as sincerely 
mourned as any writer of his generation. Most people 
think of him, from his editorial connection with " Puck," 
as a humorist, but he was much more than this. His 
novels, short stories, and poems possessed a high order 
of merit, a delicacy and a distinction that are rather 
French than English. Although much of his activity was 
given to journalism, he was not spoiled by it, as so many 
good writers are, but remained true to literary ideals 
of the higher sort throughout his brief but productive 
career. 

An edition of Mr. Stanley Waterloo's novels, "A Man 
and a Woman," and " An Odd Situation," has just been 
published in London, and for the latter work Sir Walter 
Besant has prepared an interesting preface, from which 
we quote the opening paragraph: "The appearance of 
a new literary and publishing centre is an event of great 
interest, if only on account of its rarity. Hitherto it has 
seemed as if the tendency among the English-speaking 
nations was to concentrate, rather than to increase, the 
literary centres. London has swallowed up Edinburgh 
and the provincial centres; Dublin is a silent sister; Mel- 
bourne and Sydney produce very little; Canada cannot 
hold out against New York, which is absorbing Boston, 
Philadelphia, and Baltimore. During the last five or six 
years, however, there has sprung up in the city of Chicago 
a new literary centre and a new centre of publishing. 
There exists in this city of a million [sic] inhabitants, 
which sixty years ago was but a kind of barbican, or ad- 
vanced post against the Red Indian, a company of nov- 
elists, poets, and essayists, who are united, if not by asso- 
ciations and clubs, at least by an earnest resolution to 
cultivate letters. It may be objected that this is nothing 
but a provincial coterie, such as we in this country have 
seen at Lichfield, Norwich, and other places, and that, 
like all such societies, it will presently disappear. I do 
not think that this will be the fate of the Chicago move- 
ment, for several reasons. First, the city is so huge 
that there must be continually born in it, or brought 
into it from the country, persons with the literary gift; 
next, there exists in the Northwest States an unbounded 
admiration for the literary calling a feeling which 
ought by itself to raise up aspirants; thirdly, they have 
at Chicago a University, with Professors of Literature 
and Libraries; they also have, for the higher culture, 
colleges and academies of music, theatres and opera 
houses, galleries of paintings, schools of art, and lec- 
tures of all kinds; they have a journal of literary crit- 
icism, sober, conscientious, and scholarly, from every 
point of view unsurpassed by any other literary journal 
in America or England. Besides all these aids, they 
have daily papers by the dozen, which afford the aspir- 
ant the means of a livelihood while he is working at his 
real profession. Not without importance, moreover, are 
those literary circles which are found in every little 



township of the Mississippi Valley, by means of which 
at least the young people are taught from childhood 
the dignity, and the might, and the glory of literature. 
Given, therefore, a people who are always ready to pour 
out their love and respect upon every writer who can 
touch their hearts; given these country circles of cul- 
ture; given a great city in which all the problems of hu- 
man life can be studied; given, again, a company of men 
and women resolved to give all that is best in them to 
the pursuit of letters; it would be strange, indeed, if 
there did not come out of all of this a growth of litera- 
ture worthy of joining the literature of Shakespeare, 
Milton, and Pope; Fielding and Thackeray; Lowell and 
Longfellow; Emerson and Motley."

THE 

STEARNS BICYCLE 

IS 

The Epitome of Comfort, 

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the " easy-running Stearns "; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, the better it is liked.

A TYPICAL AMERICAN. 



BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

An Address delivered before the Old-Time Printers' 
Association of Chicago, January 17, 1896, by Hon. 
JOSEPH MEDILL, Editor of the Chicago Tribune. 
It is a thoughtful and eloquent tribute to the great 
Printer, Patriot, Statesman, and Philosopher, worthy 
alike of the subject and the author. This work 
will be of especial value now, as the time draws near 
when Mr. Medill will present to the City of Chicago 
a Statue of Franklin. Handsomely printed, and em- 
bellished with several Portraits of Franklin, making 
it a gem of typographic beauty, as well as a valuable 
contribution to the literature concerning Franklin.

[May 16, 1896. 



Four Noteworthy Publications. 

A NEW WORK BY IAN MAC LA REN. 

THE MIND OF THE MASTER. 

By the Rev. JOHN WATSON (Ian Maclaren). 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The discussion by this now famous author of such topics in practical religion as "Temptation," "Individuality," "Science 
of Life," " Loss of Goods," and " Broken Homes," is characterized by the same keen insight and sympathetic touch which 
have so potently appealed to those who have read his other books. 

" It is impossible to analyze a spiritual effect, because it is largely an atmosphere, but the secret of the sweetness of this work is, we think, 
that it springs from the heart, and not (as is the case with so much of the ' religious ' literature of the day) from the intellect." 

ESSAYS ON NATURE AND CULTURE. 

Just Published. By HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE. With Portrait of the Author. 16mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.25. 

Mr. Mabie occupies a unique place among present-day writers as an interpreter of literature and culture. While all classes 
of readers will find varied delight in reading his work, ha is especially a guide and inspiration to the young reader, and no 
better book could be put into the hands of a lover of literature than the volume of Essays which is now published. 

Other Books by Mr. Mabie: MY STUDY FIRE. First Series. MY STUDY FIRE. Second Series. UNDER THE TREES AND 
ELSEWHERE. SHORT STUDIES IN LITERATURE. ESSAYS IN LITERARY INTERPRETATION. 

New Editions, each with three illustrations in photogravure, in dainty binding, ICmo, cloth, gilt tops, per volume, 81-50. 

A NEW AND IMPORTANT WORK BY EDMUND GOSSE. 

CRITICAL KIT=KATS. 

A Series of Literary Essays. By EDMUND GOSSE. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 

The title " Kit-Kats " is revived from the old Eighteenth Century word, used by the Kit-Kat Club, to signify quarter- 
length portraits. Mr. Gosse has given us not only essays, put, as in the case of Stevenson and most of the other literary men 
treated, there is a good deal of personal reminiscence. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon Mr. Gosse's charm of style. 
Also by Mr. Gosse: FROM SHAKESPEARE TO POPE. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

"A LITERARY LOG." 

RETROSPECTIVE REVIEWS. 

A Literary Log. By RICHARD LE GALLIENNE. Containing over one hundred reviews extending from George Meredith's 
" One of Our Conquerors," and Thomas Hardy's " Tess," to the Recent " Keynotes " volumes, " The Woman Who Did," 
and " Woman's Tragedies." Two volumes. Handsomely printed and bound in cloth, crown 8vo, $3.50. 
Mr. Le Gallienne has won the enviable reputation of baing a charming stylist in prose, and his careful and comprehensive 

criticism of contemporaneous literature during the last three years offers us a delightful record of obiter dicta on the more 

important books published during that time. In view of the author's immediate lecturing tour in the autumn, the book ought 

to be largely in demand.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



WITH THE FATHERS. 

With a Chapter on the Monroe Doctrine, and Other Studies 

in the History of the United States. By Prof. J. B. 

McMASTER, author of "A History of the People of the 

United States." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In addition to bis timely and important elucidation of the Monroe 
Doctrine, Prof. McMaster treats of the Third Term from the historical 
point of view, and discusses other political and financial subjects of 
grave importance as illustrated by the light of history. 

WAGES AND CAPITAL. 

An Examination of the Wages Fund Doctrine. By Prof. F. 

W. TAUSSIG, Professor of Political Economy in Harvard 

University, author of " Tariff History of the United States " 

and " The Silver Situation in the United States." 12mo, 

cloth, $1.50. 

Prof. Taussig examines the relations of capital to wages, and con- 
cludes that wages are paid from capital, but not from a predetermined 
fund of capital. He examines and rejects the doctrine that wages are 
paid from the laborer's own product. The bearing of this general rea- 
soning on practical problems, such as strikes and trades unions, and or 
general economic theory, is then considered. 

In the second part of the book, the literary history of the wages fund 
doctrine and of the discussion of wages and capital is followed in detail. 

This important and searching contribution to economic theory will 
have a wide-reaching effect on the development of political economy in 
the future, and will be indispensable for all who teach or icvestigate 
general economic theory. 

SECOND EDITION. 

THE DAWN OF CIVILIZATION. 

(EGYPT AND CHALD^A.) By Prof. G. MASPEKO. Edited 
by Rev. Prof. A. H. SAYCE. Translated by M. [i. Mc- 
CLURE. Revised and brought up to date by the iuthor. 
With Map and over 470 Dlustrations. Quarto, cloth, $7.50. 
This volume is an attempt to put together in a lucid and interesting 
manner all that the monuments have revealed to us concerting the 
earliest civilization of Egypt and Chaldaea. Prof. Maspero is peraaps the 
only man in Europe fitted by his laborious researches and great scholar- 
ship to undertake such a task, and the result of his efforts will be found 
herein. 

A new edition of the English translation of this work having been 
called for within a little over a year from its publication, an opportunity 
was offered the author to embody in it the results of the latest research. 
The part dealing with Egypt has consequently been enriched with addi- 
tions to texts and notes ; and in the chapter on Chaldaea the author 
has utilized fresh information from the recent works of Tallquist, Winck- 
ler, and Hilprecht, and from M. de Serzec's latest publications. The 
translation has been carefully revised throughout. 

FALSE COIN OR TRUE? 

By F. F. MONTRESOB, author of " The One Who Looked On," 

" Into the Highways and Hedges," etc. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Miss Montresor's new story shows a steady gain along the lines which 

have already won for her such general favor. The charming quality 

and pure atmosphere of her book will be welcomed by novel readers. 

"Miss Montresor is a writer with several distinct qualities. She does 
not follow beaten paths. She is distinctly original, and at the same 
time she does not fall into the ways of our typical modern original writ- 
ers. . . . The views she gives of her characters are from the inside 
rather than from the outside, and she makes us feel with them and see 
them as they are. ... We feel better for knowing her people." 
Milwaukee Journal. 

GREEN GATES. 

AN ANALYSIS OF FOOLISHNESS. 

By Mrs. K. M. C. MEREDITH (Johanna Staats), author of 

"Drumsticks." 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

This brilliant story of to-day furnishes pictures of Long Island 
country-house and hunting life, and of social incidents in New York. 
This tale exhibits an originality and a peculiar pathos which will enlist 
the interest of every reader. 



HIS HONOUR AND A LADY. 

By Mrs. EVERARD COTES (Sara Jeannette Duncan), author 
of "A Social Departure," "Vernon's Aunt," etc. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This brilliant picture of Anglo-Indian social and political life repre- 
sents the author's ripest and most successful work. Her originality 
and quickness of observation have kept her from following a beaten 
track, while her unfading humor will prove a constant pleasure to the 
reader. An adroit study of character and keen analysis of motives are 
features of a novel which shows an advance in literary workmanship, 
and secures for the author a high rank among contemporary writers of 
fiction. 

THE SEATS OF THE MIGHTY. 

Being the Memoirs of Captain ROBERT MORAY, some time an 
Officer in the Virginia Regiment, and afterwards of Am- 
herst's Regiment. By GILBERT PARKER, author of ' ' Pierre 
and His People," " The Trail of the Sword," " The Tres- 
passer," etc. 12mo, illustrated, cloth, $1.50. 
For the time of this story Mr. Parker has chosen the most absorbing 
period of the romantic eighteenth century history of Quebec. The ma- 
terial offered by the life and history of old Quebec has never been util- 
ized for the purposes of fiction with the command of plot and incident, 
the mastery of local color, and the splendid realization of dramatic sit- 
uations shown in this distinguished and moving romance. The illustra- 
tions preserve the atmosphere of the text, for they present the famous 
buildings, gates, and battle-grounds as they appeared at the time of the 
hero's imprisonment in Quebec. 

THE REDS OF THE MIDI. 

An Episode of the French Revolution. By FELIX GRAB. 

Translated from the Provencal by Mrs. CATHARINE A. 

JANVIER. With an Introduction by THOMAS A. JANVIER. 

With Frontispiece. 16mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"A most thrilling story." Boston Advertiser. 

" As we read this fascinating, marvellously intense book, it seems as 
though the whole story of what gave rise to the French Revolution were 
compressed within its pages. . . . The art with which this story is told 
is exquisite. ... A wonderful book." Buffalo Commercial. 

THE FOLLY OF EUSTACE. 

By R. S. HICHENS, author of " An Imaginative Man," " The

THE DUTIES OF AUTHORS. 

That every right implies a correlated duty, 
and that the assertion of the one should be con- 
ditioned upon the acceptance of the other, is a 
principle in which theoretical is more common 
flian practical acquiescence. The burden of 
Mazzini's criticism of the French Revolution 
tiras that it gave undue prominence to the Rights 
of Man, and had little to say about the corre- 
sponding Duties of Man. It was the funda- 
mental aim of that patient heroic soul to mor- 
alize the European revolutionary movement by 
insisting upon the claim of duty as a necessary 
accompaniment of the claim of right. 

Transferring the discussion from the political 
to the literary plane, we are inclined to think 
that too much has lately been heard about the 
rights of authors in comparison with what is 
said akmt their duties. It is then with peculiar 
satisfaction that we call attention to the chapter 
on " The Duties of Authors " included in Mr. 
Leslie Stephen's recently-published collection 
of addresses to ethical societies. While Sir 
Walter Besant and his associates in the Society 
of Authors are engaged in the praiseworthy 
work of exposing the wily ways of the dishonest 
publisher, it is well that a strong voice should 
now and then discourse upon the responsibili- 
ties of authorship, and sound a note of warning 
against the temptations which beset the man of 
letters under the modern commercial literary 
regime. The ethics of literature is a large sub- 
ject with many ramifications, and neither Mr. 
Stephen nor any other man could hope to treat 
of it exhaustively within the limits of a single 
essay ; but the address to which reference is 
now made touches upon the more salient fea- 
tures of the subject, and is characterized in 
unusual measure by good sense, sound logic, and 
fine ethical tone. 

So large a proportion of literary energy now- 
adays is absorbed by journalism that no discus- 
sion of the duties of authors can ignore the 
work of those who write for the newspaper 
press. It is in journalism, also, that writers 
are most strongly assailed by the temptations 
peculiar to their craft. The question of anony- 
mity, for example, is one that must be consid- 
ered in its ethical relations, and it takes the

keenest self-searching for a man to be sure that 
under the impersonal shelter of the plural pro- 
noun he is not saying things to which he would 
blush to attach his signature. Nothing is more 
contemptible than the work of the writer who 
makes himself a hireling of some party organ, 
and earns his daily bread by the advocacy of 
doctrines to which he does not personally sub- 
scribe ; doctrines that are abhorrent to him as an 
individual. Such a prostitution of literary talent 
maybe defended, is defended, in many ingenious 
ways, but the cobwebs of sophistry woven about 
the discussion by defenders of this practice are 
easily swept away by anyone who is determined 
to see things as they are and regulate his con- 
duct in accordance with the fundamental prin- 
ciples of morality. The stock argument by 
which lawyers justify their defence of the crim- 
inal of whose guilt they are convinced the 
plea that such a person is entitled to the most 
favorable interpretation of which the law ad- 
mits, and that someone must secure it for him 
is not valid in the discussion of questions of 
public interest. No matter of governmental 
policy is entitled to any other defence than may 
be made for it by those who honestly believe in 
its advisability ; for those who disbelieve in it, 
yet enlist their powers in its behalf, no con- 
demnation can be too strong. The first duty 
of the citizen is to further what he honestly 
believes to be the real interests of the state, and, 
if his activity take the special form of argument 
through the medium of the press, to be sure 
that his public utterances tally with his private 
opinions. To repudiate this obligation is to act 
the part of traitor, and in a more dangerous, 
because a more insidious, way than that of the 
leader of an armed revolt. " To thine own self 
be true " is a precept that journalists, more than 
most other people, need to keep in mind. 

Anonymity doubtless serves as a shelter for 
much of the baseness that we are reprobating ; 
yet historically, Mr. Stephen tells us, it is rather 
the effect than the cause. 

"According to a well-known anecdote, two writers 
of the eighteenth century decided by the toss of a half- 
penny which should write for Walpole and which should 
write for his adversary Pulteney; but the choice was 
generally decided by less reputable motives. Now, so 
long as the press meant such a class it was of course 
natural that the trade should be regarded as discredit- 
able, and should be carried on by men who had less care 
for their character than for their pockets. In England, 
where our development has been continuous and tradi- 
tions linger long, the sentiment long survived; and the 
practice which corresponded to it the practice, that 
is, of anonymity has itself survived the sentiment 
which gave it birth." 



Mr. Stephen then goes on to say : 

"The mask was formerly worn by men who were 
ashamed of their employment, and who had the same 
reasons for anonymity as a thief or an anarchist may 
have for a disguise. It may now be worn even by men 
who are proud of their profession, because the mask has 
a different significance." 

This latter statement is to a considerable extent 
true, but we are far from sure that the senti- 
ment is dead that gave birth to anonymity, or 
that great numbers of journalists to-day do not 
write what they are told to write, and paid for 
writing, irrespective of their own convictions. 

Anonymity has other dangers than the major 
one of making men false to themselves. It 
affords, for example, " obvious conveniences to 
a superficial omniscience." Mr. Stephen re- 
marks with genial humor : 

"The young gentleman who dogmatizes so early 
might blush if he had to sign his name to his audacious 
utterances. His tone of infallibility would be absurd 
if we knew who was the pope that was promulgating 
dogmas. The man in a mask professes to detect at a 
glance the absurd sophistries which impose upon the 
keenest contempory intellects; but if he doffed the 
mask and appeared as young Mr. Smith, or Jones, who 
took his degree last year, we might doubt whether he 
had a right to assume so calmly that the sophistry is all 
on the other side." 

The one safe rule seems to be that the anony- 
mous writer "should say nothing when he 
speaks in the plural which would make him 
look silly if he used the first person singular." 
The man who should follow this rule, and who 
should refrain from allowing any personal feel- 
ing to invade his judgments of other men and 
their works, might safely be trusted to write 
unsigned articles by the score, and, if he re- 
mained all the while true to his convictions, 
could not fairly be charged with falling short 
of the whole duty of authorship. 

Another temptation that besets the author 
is that of being content to follow current opin- 
ion, instead of doing his best to aid in its forma- 
tion. " There is an old story," says Mr. Ste- 
phen, " which tells how a certain newspaper 
used to send out an emissary to discover what 
was the common remark that everyone was 
making in omnibuses and club smoking-rooms, 
and to fashion it into next morning's article 
for the instruction of mankind. The echo 
affected to set the tune which it really repeated." 
One of the most obvious duties of authorship 
is that of having something of your own to say, 
and of preparing yourself by strenuous effort 
to say it in the most direct and forcible man- 
ner. There is a great deal more of " facile 
writing " than there was half a century ago, 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



327 



but it is doubtful if there is any more writing 
of the first-rate sort, " which speaks of a full 
mind and strong convictions, which is clear be- 
cause it is thorough." This phase of the ques- 
tion of duty as it relates to authors could not 
be better put than in the following passage : 

" I have been struck in reading newepaper articles, 
even my own, by the curious loss of individuality which 
a man seems to suffer as a writer. Unconsciously the 
author takes the color of his organ; he adopts not only 
its sentiment but its style, and seems to become a mere 
transmitter of messages, with whose substance he has 
no more to do than the wires of the electric telegraph 
which carries them. But now and then we suddenly 
come across something fresh and original; we know by 
instinct that we are being addressed by another man, 
and are in a living relation to a separate human being, 
not to a mere drilled characterless unit of a disciplined 
army ; we find actually thoughts, convictions, arguments, 
which, though all arguments are old, have evidently 
struck the writer's mind, and not merely been trans- 
mitted into his pen; and then we may know that we are 
in the presence of a real force, and meeting with a man 
who is doing his duty." 

Mr. Stephen's exposition of his theme is so 
attractive that we are loth to dismiss with a 
few words, as must, however, be done, the re- 
maining features of the discussion. There is 
the fruitful subject of writing for money, upon 
which we read : 

" I do not doubt that authors ought to be paid; but I 
certainly agree that a money reward ought never to be 
the chief aim of their writing. And I confess that some 
utterances about copyrights in these days have jarred 
upon me, because they seem to imply that the doctrine 
is not disavowed so unequivocally as it should be by our 
leaders." 

Then there is the subject of writing too much 
to write anything well, concerning which the 
author discourses feelingly, and of which mel- 
ancholy examples are about us on every hand. 
Then there is the suggestive disquisition upon 
literary preaching, which deserves an article by 
itself. Finally, there is the deeply interesting 
discussion of duty as it applies to the imagina- 
tive worker, the duty of eschewing false real- 
ism and false sentimentalism alike, of avoiding 
like the plague the promptings of the familiar 
spirit that confuses notoriety with fame, and, 
pointing out how easily the one may be secured, 
deludes the writer into thinking that it is much 
the same thing as the other. All these matters 
must be passed over with a word, and space 
found only for the conclusion that " the endur- 
ing power of every great writer depends not 
merely on his intellectual forces, but upon the 
charm of his character the clear recognition 
of what it really is that makes life beautiful 
and desirable, and of what are the baser ele- 
ments that fight against the elevating forces." 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JAPAN. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. )\ 

I have already referred in your columns to the re- 
newed popularity of the English language in Japan. 
The principal reason for this increased interest is well 
set forth in the following opening paragraph of an 
English article by Naibu Kanda, M.A., on " English in 
Middle Schools," in a recent number of "The Sun": 

" The successful termination of the war has given an impe- 
tus to industrial and commercial enterprises to an extent 
hitherto unprecedented in the annals of this country. It ia 
not too much to expect that in the next ten years the material 
progress of Japan will completely throw into the shade her no 
inconsiderable achievements in the past thirty years. She has 
come forth victorious from the storms of the battle-field, only 
to be plunged into a mightier conflict the struggle for su- 
premacy in the field of commerce. Not the least of her wea- 
pons in this species of warfare is the knowledge of European 
languages, especially English, the intellectual currency of 
the commercial world." 

This article a plea for more careful, thorough, and 
practical instruction in English is itself an indication 
of the present tendency. It is true that for some time 
" The Sun " has contained several pages of English 
notes, edited and principally written by Mr. Kanda 
a graduate of Amherst College, in the class of 1880; 
but it is now found possible to change these notes to 
more elaborate articles, written by leading English 
scholars among the Japanese. The two previous issues 
of " The Sun," for instance, contained a well-written 
article on some sociological problems of the day in 
Japan. "The Educator," the organ of The Christian 
Education Society, contains every month about four 
pages of English notes; and frequently the daily papers 
print a few columns of English matter. 

But most significant of all is the fact that an English 
magazine has just been started by the Japanese. It is 
to be published monthly, and is called " The Far East." 
It is practically an English edition of the Kokumin no 
Tamo (" The Nation's Friend "), a brilliant and success- 
ful vernacular magazine ; but while some of the matter 
will appear in both periodicals, many articles will be 
written originally for " The Far East." Whether the 
articles are all first hand or only translations, they will 
together serve to make the new magazine " a mirror 
of Japanese public thought," and will unquestionably 
bring the East and the West into closer sympathy with 
each other. Being subjected to foreign revision before 
publication, the magazine is remarkably free from the 
errors that mar so much of the independent writing of 
English by Japanese. It is certainly to be hoped that 
" The Far East " will live long and prosper. That it 
desires and deserves a wide circulation in foreign coun- 
tries is evident from the fact that the annual subscrip- 
tion (including postage) is only 1.50 yen, or, at the pres- 
ent rate of exchange, only a little over 80 cents. And, 
even if the Japanese silver yen, now quoted at 53 cents 
should rise to 67 cents, the magazine would then cost 
only $1.00 per year in the United States. 

Pardon me if I take the space to mention one more 
indication of the renewed interest in the study of En- 
glish and other European languages, as shown in the 
fact that there will probably be established in Tokyo, 
under government auspices, a special " School of Foreign 
Languages." ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

MR. IiOCKER'S "CONFIDENCES."* 

That Mr. Frederick Locker-Lampson's pleas- 
ant " Confidences " cannot be accorded a place 
beside the kindred volumes of Rousseau and 
others who have freely unbosomed themselves 
to the world is largely due to the fact that the 
author has nothing of a comfortably shocking 
or scandalous nature to confess. Grace, wit, 
variety, the amiable London lyrist naturally 
has in abundance ; but the only approach to 
a breach of good morals that we find him own- 
ing to is that he once sneaked away from a 
" Charity Breakfast " without " paying the 
shot." It came about in this wise. In an un- 
guarded moment Mr. Locker accepted an invi- 
tation to that meal from the "Patagonian 
Church Extension Society"; hour, half-past 
eight ; chairman, the philanthropic Sir Bonamy 
Veroles. Mr. Locker arrived on time (and 
uncommonly hungry), helped himself liber- 
ally to the tongue and toast (thus committing 
himself to the breakfast), and was just begin- 
ning to feel chatty and comfortable, when, he 
says, up stepped " a busybody of a fellow in a 
white tie, who, with ostentatious assurance, 
slapped down a blank cheque, a lead pencil, 
and the eulogy of the charity at my plate, look- 
ing significantly at me and my substantial slice 
of tongue as he did so." It at once dawned 
on Mr. Locker that he was trapped. It was a 
clear breach of hospitality ; and one can easily 
pardon Mr. Locker for momentarily wishing 
the Patagonian Church, its extenders, and Sir 
Bonamy Veroles, at the tropics. His first 
impulse was to fly. But how ? Here a bright 
thought struck him. Clapping one hand osten- 
tatiously to his waistcoat, and feigning a look 
of subdued but intense agony, he rose painfully 
from his chair, slipped past the astonished 
waiters, weathered the coldly inquiring stare 
of the plainly incredulous Sir Bonamy, gained 
the hallway, jumped into a cab and drove home. 
So much affected was Mr. Locker by the dra- 
matic force of his impersonation, that, he tells 
us, " I kept my hand where I had placed it till 
I reached my own door." 

Mr. Locker's " Confidences " were prepared 
for publication, he says, largely in the interests 
of accuracy and for the benefit of his own de-

dressed to my Descendants. By Frederick Locker-Larupson.

scendants to the tender mercies of whose un- 
certain memories he was unwilling to trust his 
treasured cargo of family records and ancestral 
anecdotes. " In this little matter," he adds, 
" I cannot trust them : they would make havoc 
of my hobby. I hardly know which is the more 
trying to me their languid endurance of a 
family story, or their inaccurate repetition of 
it." The volume was written at different pe- 
riods during the last fifteen years of Mr. 
Locker's life, and was in type at the date of 
his death, May 30, 1895. It contains, besides 
the pleasantly diversified story of his life and 
adventures, and the family portraits and anec- 
dotes, several " biographical sketches," or, 
rather, portraits from memory, of noted literary 
people Thackeray, George Eliot and Mr. 
Lewes, Dickens, Leigh Hunt, Dean Stanley, 
Carlyle, etc. 

Mr. Locker was born in 1821, at Greenwich 
Hospital, of which his father, a somewhat 
Shandean character, was Civil Commissioner. 
Around this institution most of his early mem- 
ories cluster, his affectionate description of it 
recalling Lamb's paper on the Temple. His 
mother was the daughter of the Rev. Jonathan 
Boucher, an excellent divine and philologist, 
who spent part of his early manhood in Amer- 
ica, and was a close friend of Washington. 
When the revolutionary troubles began, how- 
ever, Dr. Boucher preached boldly against the 
cause of the colonists, running no small risk of 
personal violence in doing so, and was at length 
compelled to return to England. His last ser- 
mon, preached at Annapolis, with pistols on his 
pulpit cushion, concluded as follows : "As long 
as I live, yea, while I have my being, will I 
proclaim, ' God save the King ! ' The author 
notes that he lent Thackeray several of Wash- 
ington's letters to his grandfather, while the 
novelist was writing " Henry Esmond." Mrs. 
Locker, the author's mother, was a pious wo- 
man of Evangelical leanings emphatically " a 
church-going animal," as her son somewhat rue- 
fully recalls. In her more scrupulous moments 
she seems to have held the opinion (though in 
general a cheerful soul) that cards and dancing 
were hardly compatible with salvation. Her 
Sabbatarian views entailed the usual penalties 
on her children. Says Mr. Locker : 

" I well remember the sultry Sunday evenings when 
my mother would carry me off to an ugly little pepper- 
boxed temple, with its tin-kettle bell, where we sim- 
mered through Mr. Shepherd's long-winded pastorals. 
The mean, cramped, white-painted pew; the faint and 
unpleasant odor of Mr. Shepherd's large flock (how he 
collected it was a mystery), made the worthy man's 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

weariful discourses doctrine, reproof, instruction, and 
dubious grammar still more irksome. I was very do- 
cile, and I remained so. I am told that the devout 
Papuans perform their religious rites standing on one 
leg. If ever my lot should be cast among these simple 
people, I should be glad to oblige them." 

Widely different from the dissenting Mr. 
Shepherd was the official Hospital chaplain, 
Dr. Coke, R.M., a stanch Churchman of the 
orthodox shovel-hatted, port-wine school, who 
preferred absolute unbelief to shaky theology. 
" He was," says Mr. Locker (not very rever- 
entially), " a kindly but choleric old boy, with 
a sanguine complexion and roomy boots." Be- 
ing summoned once officially to administer 
ghostly comfort to a mariner who was about to 
slip his cable for the next world and had some 
reasonable doubts as to his probable destina- 
tion, Dr. Coke said reassuringly : " Don 't con- 
cern yourself about that, my dear sir that 's 
my affair ! " 

Mr. Locker's first school was a preparatory 
one at Clapham, kept by a Miss Griffin, of 
whom he remembers little save that she had all 
the qualities of a kitchen-poker, " except its 
occasional warmth." Miss Griffin was succeeded 
by Mr. Barnett, an Orbilius of the rod, who 
knew little Latin and much less Greek, and 
who sought to awaken in his pupil a taste for 
the classics by thrashing him severely with the 
buckle-ends of his own braces. " I am sure," 
Mr. Locker says, " Mr. Barnett was an absurd 
man. and that his ignorance was encyclopaedic." 

" Years afterwards he came to see my father at Green- 
wich, and I was amazed to think that the person before 
me, old and gauche, and with a propitiatory grin, was 
that formidable savage who had once exercised so terri- 
ble a sway. We talked of past days, and as he was 
rather jocose, I ventured to say that I still felt the ting- 
ling of his hazel switches. The miserable creature pre- 
tended he had no recollection of these matters. It is 
strange, my dear young friend, but I have entirely for- 
gotten it.' Perhaps you have forgotten it, sir; but then, 
you were at the other end of the switch.' I never saw 
him after that day." 

The next school was Mr. Wright's a dismal 
"Low Church" establishment, where the pupils' 
main dissipation was 

" An occasional clerical meeting, where Biblical proph- 
ecy and the Apocalyptic number 666 were frantically 
discussed by a knot of what I now think must have been 
presumptuous jackasses, and in a way that then occa- 
sioned me cold, clammy terrors. I still suffer from their 
sinister predictions." 

After Mr. Wright's came " a huge unregenerate 
school at Dulwich," where Mr. Locker learned 
little or nothing ; and finally a day-school at 
Blackheath, where, he says, 
" I remained two years, and had an inglorious time of 



it. The only thing I did pretty well was original poetry. 
A subject was given us, and by a certain day we pro- 
duced a poem. My mother wrote most of mine! " 

About this time Mr. Locker's parents began, 
with some reason, to despair of him ; for what 
was the use, they argued, of his being clever at 
fives and cricket and rhyming, if he spelt abom- 
inably and could scarcely construe a line of 
Latin ? So Oxford and Cambridge plans, and 
aspirations in the direction of the bar or the 
church, were abandoned ; and the future poet 
presently found himself perched on a high stool 
in a Mincing Lane counting-house, where for a 
twelvemonth or so he made a cheerful pretence 
of " learning the business," learning in reality 
little except the foibles and oddities of his 
fellow-clerks, upon which he delighted to prac- 
tise, and which are humorously recorded. At 
this point in his narrative Mr. Locker indulges 
in some melancholy reflections on current social 
changes and democratic tendencies, gloomily 
forseeing a day when the Archbishop of Can- 
terbury (successor of Becket and Pole !) " may 
occasionally be seen on the roof of a Piccadilly 
omnibus "; and when Devonshire House shall 
be converted into " a dry-goods store on the 
American plan." The change, he fears, will 
soon be here. The tokens of it are in the air. 
" Only a few days ago I saw a deplorably dressed ani- 
mal, diamonds and emeralds stuck in bispostiche cravat, 
lounge up the steps of White's Club, and take his seat 
in the bow- window the bow- window, mind you, of the 
Somersets, the Stanhopes, the Fanes ; then I recognized 
that he was my stockbroker, and in acknowledgment of 
my obeisance he gave me a calculated and reserved bow." 

In 1841 Mr. Locker received a temporary 
clerkship in Somerset House, and in the fol- 
lowing year was transferred to the Admiralty, 
in Whitehall. Here he was made private sec- 
retary to Lord Haddington and was afterwards 
appointed deputy reader and precis writer 
offices which he seems to have filled to the satis- 
faction of his chiefs. A trip to the continent 
in 1849 led eventually to his marriage (1850) 
to Lady Charlotte Bruce. Mr. Locker tells 
very prettily " how it came about." 

" We had seated ourselves on a bench (in Hyde Park) 
and neither spoke. I took her hand. ' This is the pret- 
tiest hand in the world,' said I. ' I happen to know of 
one that 's quite as pretty,' said she. Another silence. 
Perhaps I was incredulous, but when she put the other 
pretty hand into mine I knew that we were both very 
happy." 

Mr. Locker's marriage to Lady Charlotte 
was plainly the turning-point in his fortunes ; 
and he seems to have lived thenceforth as a 
man of means, first-rate social position, and 
abundant leisure. " London Lyrics " (" certain

sparrow-flights of song," he modestly terms 
them) were published in 1857, while Mr. Locker 
was still at the Admiralty. They soon attracted 
the favorable notice of Thackeray. He invited 
Mr. Locker to write for the " Cornhill Maga- 
zine," and once said to him, in reply to an allu- 
sion to his own poetry, " Yes, I have a sixpenny 
talent (or gift), and so have you ; ours is small- 
beer, but, you see, it is the right tap." A good 
many of us will doubtless prefer this wholesome 
" small beer " to some other " taps " of a much 
more pretentious brand. 

Mr. Locker naturally knew many people of 
note, literary and otherwise ; and his reminis- 
cences of them are fresh and piquant and 
sometimes a little satirical. Mrs. Browning he 
saw occasionally at her own fireside. 

"Her physique was peculiar: curls like the pendent 
ears of a water-spaniel, and poor little hands so thin 
that when she welcomed you she gave you something 
like the foot of a young bird; the Hand that made her 
great had not made her fair. But she had striking eyes, 
and we forgot any physical shortcomings they were 
entirely lost sight of in what I may call her incompar- 
able sweetness, I might almost say affectionateness; just 
as, while we are reading it, we lose sight of the incom- 
pleteness of her poetry its lack of artistic control." 

George Eliot, says Mr. Locker, 
" Was, to my mind, a plain woman. Her countenance 
was equine she was rather like a horse ; and her head 
had been intended for a much longer body she was 
not a tall woman. She wore her hair in not-pleasing, 
out-of- fashion loops, coming down on either side of her 
face, so hiding her ears; and her garments concealed her 
outline they gave her a waist like a milestone. . . . 
She had a measured way of conversing; restrained, but 
impressive. ... As she often discussed abstract sub- 
jects, she might have been thought pedantic, especially 
as her language was sprinkled with a scientific termin- 
ology ; but I do not think she was a bit of a pedant. . . . 
I have been told she was most agreeable en tete-a-tete; 
that when surrounded by admirers she was apt to be- 
come oratorical." 

Mr. Locker attended the funeral of George 
Henry Lewes, at Highgate. 

" We were a very small party in the mortuary chapel, 
not more than twelve persons. I never before had seen 
so many out-and-out rationalists in so confined a space. 
A brief discourse was delivered by a Unitarian clergy- 
man, who half apologized for suggesting the possible 
immortality of some of our souls." 

In his pleasant paper on Leigh Hunt, Mr. 
Locker describes the poet as a man of striking 
appearance " tall, dark, grizzled, bright-eyed, 
and rather fantastically dressed in a sacerdotal- 
looking garment." He visited Hunt three or 
four times at Hammersmith, and each time 
liked him better. Once he took tea with him. 

" The meal was presided over by a nimble-fingered 
little nymph of a daughter in a stuff frock imperfectly 
hooked and eyed. She had not even the coquetry to 



pin her collar straight. I can still hear his Jacintha, 
give Mr. Locker another cup of tea,' delivered in a 
suave, almost stately, manner, and in silvery tones." 

The saying that an author is the reverse of 
all other objects, in that he magnifies at a dis- 
tance and diminishes as you approach him, Mr. 
Locker declines to apply to Leigh Hunt. He 
plainly liked the amiable, chronically impecu- 
nious, and very unworldly poet ; and even finds 
it in his heart to admire " his beautiful reliance 
on providence" which word, by-the-by, he 
rather significantly "ventures in this connection 
to spell with a little * p.' " Kindly Mr. Locker ! 
Despite the " Charity Breakfast," one can 
easily fancy him enacting on occasion the prov- 
ident raven at the shabby Hammersmith lodg- 
ings. Mr. Locker's " Confidences " deserves, 
as much as any book of the kind that has fallen 
in our way in a long time, the trite praise that 
" there is not a dull page in it." Mr. Augustine 
Birrel is the editor ; and we are glad to note 
that he has provided a good index. E. 6. J. 



THE PSYCHIC ASPECTS OF SOCIOLOGY.* 



Professor Giddings, author of " The Princi- 
ples of Sociology," states in his preface that the 
particular object of the work is " to combine 
the principles of sociology in a coherent theory." 
He aims to direct attention chiefly to the psy- 
chic aspects of social phenomena, " believing 
that sociology is a psychological science, and 
that the description of society in biological 
terms is a mistake." But the biological terms 
structure, function, organ, and many others, 
occur at frequent intervals, because all higher 
activities must borrow their designations from 
the lower and first known. This volume seeks 
to avoid such metaphors, and they are not so 
common as in many other works, yet their fre- 
quent employment shows that he cannot escape 
from them. 

The chief explanatory idea of the treatise is 
the " consciousness of kind," which is defined 
as being " a state of consciousness in which any 
being, whether low or high in the scale of life, 
recognizes another conscious being as of like 
kind with itself." For this notion the author 
claims originality, and thinks he has mediated 
successfully between the theories of imitation 
and social compulsion proposed in recent French 
discussions. Starting with this definition of the

principle of association, the material is divided 
into four books : " The Elements of Social 
Theory," "The Elements and Structure of So- 
ciety," " The Historical Evolution of Society," 
and " Social Process, Law, and Cause." 

In the first book, Professor Giddings dis- 
cusses the sociological idea. Society means a 
naturally developing group of conscious beings, 
in which converse passes into definite relation- 
ships which in the course of time are wrought 
into a complex and enduring organization. 
Sociology is the systematic description and ex- 
planation of society viewed as a whole. It is 
the general science of social phenomena. It 
is an interpretation of human society in terms 
of natural causation. It refuses to look upon 
humanity as outside of the cosmic process, and 
as a law unto itself. Sociology is an attempt 
to account for the origin, growth, structure, 
and activities of society by the operation of 
physical, vital, and psychical causes, working 
together in a process of evolution. 

Sociology has a distinct province ; it studies 
the phenomena that are consequent upon one 
state in particular namely, the consciousness 
of kind. Psychology studies all states of con- 
sciousness. Sociology is the science of elements 
and first principles that underlie all special 
social sciences, as economics and politics. What 
biology is to the special life-sciences of botany 
and zoology, that sociology is to the special 
social sciences. The data assumed in politics 
and in political economy are explained and 
traced to their origin by sociology. 

In considering the elements and structure of 
society, we encounter facts of aggregation and 
association of the population. Human beings 
are naturally gregarious, and groups are formed 
by family connections or by common settle- 
ments. Persons thus brought together form 
communities. The welding process is accom- 
panied by conflict, but also by communication, 
imitation, tolerance, and mutual aid. The social 
nature becomes more imitative, tolerant, and 
sympathetic. But the action of evolution upon 
various individuals is unequal, and from this 
inequality of pressure and result there arise the 
various social classes. These classes are of 
three kinds : vitality classes, personality classes, 
and social classes. In the study of these popu- 
lation classes, the author finds the key to the 
scientific arrangement of the problems of prac- 
tical sociology. But it does not seem to be 
within the scope of sociology, as defined by 
Professor Giddings, to give any place to prac- 
tical sociology, nor does he anywhere distinctly 



show where the discussion of the subject be- 
longs. Professor Wagner's well-known defini- 
tion of the scope of political economy goes 
much further than our author's definition of 
social science, since it includes an estimate of 
the social value of economic ways of life, and 
suggests better methods of realizing the ob- 
jects of industrial activity. Even the brief 
treatment of the ends of society in this work 
would seem to be logically excluded from a 
science which is simply descriptive and explan- 
tory. It is rather creditable to the writer that 
his vision of the scope of sociology is wider 
than the hampering definition with which he 
begins. 

From association arises the evolution of the 
social mind, the feelings, thoughts, and voli- 
tions which go from person to person and are 
shared by a whole assembly or community. 
Waves of emotion or of ideas are carried along 
by imitation or sympathy. Discussion secures 
a deliberate agreement upon common notions 
after reflection. In order to have such a fel- 
lowship in convictions and purposes, there must 
be contact, leadership, and organs of communi- 
cation, as press and pulpit. The social self- 
consciousness is made continuous by means of 
economic, juridical, political, and other tradi- 
tions, oral or written. These traditions are 
framed into standards, platforms, codes, and 
creeds. 

Out of this mingling of intellectual products 
with desires issue social estimates of things 
socially important, as preservation of the type, 
cohesion, possessions, and conditions of devel- 
opment. These estimates are the grounds of 
social choices. 

A distinction is made between social compo- 
sition and social constitution. The groupings of 
the social composition are natural products of 
the physiological and psychological activities 
of individuals, supplemented by natural selec- 
tion. They are at first unconscious products, 
but at later stages are subjected to choice. Then 
the author treats the rise of families of various 
types, ethnical and demotic aggregates as 
hordes, tribes, and communes, counties and 
cities. The constitution of a society means the 
organization of its members into association for 
specific purposes as governments, literary 
and religious societies. The greatest of these 
purposive organizations is the state. The an- 
alysis of voluntary associations, political, juris- 
tic, economic, and cultural, while very brief, is 
one of the best of several good discussions in 
the volume. The author here does justice to 



332

a form of organization which De Tocqueville 
regarded as one of the most important elements 
in American life. 

The table of contents for Book III., on " The 
Historical Evolution of Society," is simply ap- 
palling. It irresistibly reminds one of the 
wonder and admiration excited by Goldsmith's 
village school-master ; and the wonder grows 
with consideration. One hundred and sixty 
pages are given to zoogenic association, anthro- 
pogenic association, ethnogenic association, and 
demogenic association. The generalizations 
cover all events, known and guessed at, since 
the very early dawn of life. Whether they are 
true or not, or at least agree with the present 
consensus of experts, must be determined by 
the critics in many widely-scattered fields, and 
these specialists have already begun to com- 
ment. A council, composed of a biologist, an 
anthropologist, an ethnologist, a master of folk- 
psychology, and a philologist, would be required 
for a jury. And yet the author is justified in 
making the attempt, since a consistent theory 
on the subject could never be produced by the 
corps of contributors to an encyclopedia, but 
must come from some one brain. It is very 
comforting, in this clamorous and uneasy age 
of specialists, to read a calm and confident mes- 
sage like this : " Such, then, is the complete 
philosophy of history." The author's large 
knowledge of contemporary conditions appears 
with especial advantage in the analysis and ex- 
planation of contemporary society. His esti- 
mate of Christianity is this : 

" It became the most tremendous power in history. 
Gradually it has been realizing its ideal, until, to-day, 
a Christian philanthropy and a Christian missionary en- 
terprise, rapidly outgrowing the esoteric sentimentalism 
of their youth, and devoting themselves to the diffusion 
of knowledge, to the improvement of conditions, and to 
the upbuilding of character, are uniting the classes and 
the races of men in a spiritual harmony." 

In the last book, on " The Social Process," 
Professor Giddings estimates the physical fac- 
tor in social evolution. Human history is a 
part of cosmic evolution, and all social energy 
is transmuted physical energy. Hence, social 
progress is conditioned by the laws of matter 
and force. The persistence of force, the pro- 
cess of equilibration, and the physical necessity 
of evolution, are generalizations assumed as a 
basis ; and they are as true of the social popu- 
lation as of inorganic matter. Density of pop- 
ulation depends upon food supply, and culture 
is dependent on density of population. The 
direction of social activity is determined by the 
line of least resistance, and the movements of 



population are rhythmical. The functions of 
society vary with its structure, and become 
more definite and complex. 

The social process involves psychical as well 
as biological elements. Personality is produced 
by association. The ego is the centre of all 
social forces. It is not merely the product of 
heredity and individual experience, but of social 
influences and of the reaction upon these. The 
self is determined in its character by all its 
antecedents, but it also combines and modifies 
energies, and is itself a living force. Hence 
arise " volitional associations " through which 
communities express their common desires, act 
upon each other and upon nature, and make a 
social life of culture possible. The individual 
and society are ever reciprocally dependent. 
Communism and individualism are poles of one 
world. The modifications of the ego by social 
life are fixed in the structure of the brain and 
nerves, and so their effects are transmitted. 

The social process moves by causation and 
according to law. The primary social forces 
are psychical impulse, imitation, and rational 
choice. But the effects of volition are limited 
in the physical process by selection and sur- 
vival. The laws of rational choice are "un- 
changing relations between the groupings of 
social values and the forms of social conduct." 
There are subjective and objective criteria of 
the ideal good, the former relating to inherent 
qualities of excellence, the latter to the adapta- 
tions of means to ends. The values are eco- 
nomic, ethical, and sociological. The ideal 
good, in its final form, combines virtue and 
pleasure, integrity and the expansion of life. 
Society advances in its preference of ideals. 
Personal force is first esteemed ; then utilitarian 
happiness ; then puritanic integrity ; and, last 
of all, self-realization. 

Passing from ends to means, the author 
states the law of combinations : 

" A population that has but few interests, which, how- 
ever, are harmoniously combined, will be conservative 
in its choices. A population that has varied interests 
which are yet inharmoniously combined will be radical 
in its choices. Only the population that has many, va- 
ried, and harmoniously combined interests will be con- 
sistently progressive in its choices." 

But while social choices are determined by sub- 
jective values, survival is governed by organic 
and objective utility. Only that form of con- 
duct can endure which secures the widest and 
most harmonious arrangement for promoting 
life. The unnatural and injurious must be dis- 
solved. 

Society is more than an organism, it is an

organization, partly a product of unconscious 
evolution and partly a result of conscious plan- 
ning. The function of society is to develop 
conscious life and to create human personality. 
This function is the end or final cause of society.

EUGENE FIELD.* 

Some men have made their successes in lit- 
erature through the quality of their thought, 
but these have not always been as admirable for 
the form which that thought has assumed ; other 
men have distinguished themselves by the grace 
and charm of the setting which they have given 
to ideas not necessarily great or profound ; and 
yet others have won their way to a secure place 
in the hearts of mankind by a generous person- 
ality, which has asserted itself over and above 
all that they have said, and has been, indeed, 
the nerve and centre of all their sayings. The 
whimsical kindness of a Charles Lamb is always 
to be noted in whatever he has to bring into 
the light of day ; the pleasure in an essay of 
Leigh Hunt's is something still apart from the 
contribution which he presents or the method 
which he uses in presenting it. The humorist 
is likely to have this winning personality ; often 
we are interested not exclusively in his mes- 
sage or the finish with which he utters it, but 
in that third something, over and above his 
work, predominantly alive in it, which is really 
the man himself, his nature, his character, his 
distinctive point of view. 

I think that we notice the same quality in the 
writings of Eugene Field. This is not to say 
that his work is deficient in finish, or that it is 
lacking in thought ; but only that in whatever 
he does we find preeminent that generosity, that 
bonhomie, which is the man. Whenever we 
open one of his books, we find, in addition to the 
story or the poem or the oddity which is the 
product of a humor always alert, the genial 
personality of the author rising before us and 
thus enhancing the gift which his hands are 
bearing to us. As Mr. Edward Everett Hale 
says in an introduction to one of these vol- 
umes: 

" All that he writes, indeed, is quite free from the 
conventionalism to which authorship as a profession is 
sadly liable. Because he is free from them, you read 
his poem or you read his prose, and are affected as if 
you met him. If you were riding in a Pullman car

with him, or if you were talking with him at breakfast 
over your coffee, he would say just such things in just 
this way. If he had any art, it was the art of conceal- 
ing art. But I do not think that he thought much of 
art. I do not think that he cared much for what peo- 
ple say about criticism or style. He wrote as he felt, 
or as he thought, without troubling himself much about 
method. It is this simplicity, or what it is the fashion 
of the day to call frankness, which gives a singular charm 
to his writing." 

It is a curious fact that a man of Mr. Field's 
taste and temperament should have done so 
much of his work for the daily press. The 
haste with which newspaper work must be done 
certainly stands in the way of many kinds of 
excellence ; it must be granted, however, that 
the excellences of clearness and immediate 
effectiveness are fostered by the constant appeal 
to large audiences, upon whom an impression 
must be made at once or not at all. That a 
man who revelled in old editions of rare books, 
who delighted in illuminated missals and monk- 
ish legends, whose mind was full of the fairy- 
lore of all times and races, should spend so 
much of his life in the rapid work required 
by the newspaper is somewhat singular. To 
be sure, rapidity of work does not of necessity 
imply either superficiality or carelessness ; the 
editorial or the brief paragraph, of the best 
sort, requires large knowledge and preliminary 
thought, and each must have incisiveness of 
utterance. However much Mr. Field's earlier 
writings suffered from the conditions in which 
they were perforce produced, it may, perhaps, 
not be fanciful to trace in his mature efforts, 
to which leisure contributed its part, some of 
the better and higher qualities belonging to 
work produced with diurnal regularity for im- 
mediate consumption, but bearing the genuine 
literary stamp. It may be said that we have 
as yet made but very inadequate provision in 
our life for the talent that should by its nature 
devote itself to expression ; and journalism 
seems to afford to the young writer a resource 
which he finds only with much greater difficulty 
elsewhere. 

The writer of this notice must admit that he 
has only an imperfect sympathy with the mass 
of productions in various dialects, supposably 
of the English tongue, and many of which are 
entirely unknown to him, that have been clam- 
oring for public attention of late. He can see 
no adequate reason why a writer should volun- 
tarily select an inferior medium, when the great 
speech of the century is at his disposal ; nor 
why a talent whose products are expected to be 
read quite generally should hamper itself with 
the inconvenient narrownesses of a single sec-

tion of the land. He is mindful of the " Big- 
low Papers," but yet remembers that patriotism 
belongs to the whole country, and has thus far 
found its highest utterance in America in the 
" Commemoration Ode." The humanity of Mr. 
Field has brought him safely through waters 
where many another vessel has gone to pieces. 
The dialect story or poem, if it be more than a 
mere curiosity or a scientific disclosure of an 
out-of-the-way phase of life, must reveal some 
trait that touches the universal heart. Mr. 
Field has fairly done this in his best efforts of 
the kind, although he would doubtless have 
agreed with the critic who classed the dialect 
effusions among writings of his that he esti- 
mated at the lowest rate. 

It is always an interesting thing to watch the 
growth of a writer, to find him becoming grad- 
ually cognizant of where his main strength lies, 
and winning a mastery more and more sufficient 
of that strength. Mr. Eoswell M. Field, in 
his touching memorial of his brother in one of 
these volumes, speaks of the deepening insight 
and enlarging sympathy manifest in the later 
years of Eugene Field's life. In the volume 
of stories beginning with " The Holy Cross," 
one sees this conscious command of the instru- 
ment which he has selected for his use. The 
motives in these stories are more home-like, 
the fancy is better held in check, the humor is 
delicate as anywhere in Field's efforts. The 
author is evidently making his way to the doing 
successfully of what he can do best. The ac- 
tualities of life impress him more, the whimsi- 
calities have in them something besides their 
strangeness and oddity. He is on the thresh- 
old of the book which contains so much of his 
sincerest thought and feeling, the "Love Affairs 
of a Bibliomaniac." 

Everybody is familiar with "The Biblio- 
maniac's Prayer ": 

" But if, O Lord, it please th thee 

To keep me in temptation's way, 
I humbly ask that I may be 

Most notably beset to-day ; 
Let my temptation be a book, 

Which I shall purchase, hold, and keep, 
Whereon, when other men shall look, 

They '11 wail to know I got it cheap." 

Out of the feeling expressed in this poem grows 
a book. It appears that the idea of the " Love 
Affairs " was in its author's mind for a long 
time. He was a collector of the enthusiastic 
kind, and it is not strange that his fervor at 
last found vent in the way in which it did. We 
must all concede that the way is certainly a 
happy one, and that its discoverer has admira- 
bly exploited its possibilities. He follows it 



through its varying windings with unflagging 
humor, and leads us delightfully from one gar- 
den spot to another. The wisdom as well as 
the wit is all through it in its author's best and 
peculiar manner. The poems also scattered up 
and down the volume share in the writer's en- 
thusiasm, as witness the following : 

" My garden aboundeth in pleasant nooks, 

And fragrance is over it all ; 
For sweet is the smell of my old, old books, 

In their places against the wall. 
" Here is a folio that 's grim with age, 
And yellow and green with mould ; 
There 's the breath of the sea on every page, 

And the hint of a stanch ship's hold. 
" And here is a treasure from France la belle 

Exhaleth a faint perfume 
Of wedded lily and asphodel 
In a garden of song abloom. 

" Come, pluck with me in my garden nooks 

The posies that bloom for all ; 
Oh, sweet is the smell of my old, old books, 
In their places against the wall." 

There is always, apart from the pathos, an 
imaginative effect in an unfinished book ; we 
can proceed to complete it for ourselves in our 
own way, or we can wonder what the author 
would have done with it, and think of him as 
continuing his pleasant labors, and, with his 
powers at their height, fashioning habitations 
for his thoughts and fancies more perfect than 
those he built of old. 

We hear it occasionally said, perhaps some- 
what under the breath, and yet with consider- 
able assurance of its truth, that the golden age 
of prose has fairly set in, and that poetry, so 
long a sovereign, must now submit to become 
a vassal to its stronger brother. Notwithstand- 
ing this fine and recent theory, one discovers, 
after all, that the deepest and sincerest utter- 
ances of any man, competent to rhythmical 
composition, take the old but ever new form of 
rhyme and metre and stanza. The poetry of 
Eugene Field contains his truest contribution 
to the thought and art of his day ; whether we 
consider his disclosures of the pleasures and 
weaknesses of the bibliophile, in which he was 
so immersed and which he knew so well, or 
whether we read his renderings of Horace into 
a modernity at times perhaps somewhat too 
insistent, we touch the truest chord of the 
poet's nature ; and when we come to his songs 
of the intimate life of home and childhood, we 
are aware of a gift unique and tender. What- 
ever technical deficiencies we may find, or how- 
ever a false note in some of the best known of 
these verses may offend our ear, we are quick 
to overlook it in the simplicity and genuineness 
of the feeling. Every man who writes at all

writes a good deal that his matured experience 
would fain forget, and the man is fortunate of 
whom a critic like Mr. Stedman can say : 

" That he did much beneath his standard, fine and 
true at times, is unquestionable, and many a set of 
verses went the rounds that harmed his reputation. For 
all this, he certainly has left pieces, compact of the 
rarer elements, sufficient in number to preserve for him 
a unique place among America's original characters, 
scholarly wits, and poets of bright fancy. Yorick is no 
more ! But his genius will need no chance upturning of 
his grave-turf for its remembrance. When all is sifted, 
its fame is more likely to strengthen than to decline." 

The publishers have brought their tribute to 
the poet and humorist ; these books are beauti- 
ful books indeed ; and we all know of what the 
house that issues them, and the DeVinne Press, 
are capable. Louis J. BLOCK.

of the elements of common humanity in the most

just published by Mr. Howells raise the question 
above suggested, and it is not altogether easy to de- 
cide which of these conflicting tendencies is empha- 
sized by them. Both the stories are about Shakers, 
and the author's success in attaching a genuine hu- 
man interest to Shakers is sufficient evidence of his 
art. In " The Day of Their Wedding," two young 
people brought up in the community grow carnally- 
minded toward one another, and seek " the world 
outside " for the purpose of living together in the 
normal relation of man and wife. The force of 
early training proves too strong for them, however, 
and after a day of delirious excitement at Saratoga 
they falter in their resolve, and return unwedded 
to their associates. In "A Parting and a Meeting," 
the theme is approached from the other direction. 
Two young people about to be married stray, half 
by accident, into a Shaker village. Both are much 
impressed by what they see, and the deeper na- 
ture of the man succumbs so quickly to the prose- 
lytizing influence that he then and there decides to 
abandon his worldly career in order to become a 
Shaker. In both these stories Mr. Howells makes 
much of the "psychological moment," and both 
must stand or fall in accordance with our estimate 
of the adequacy of the impelling motive. In the 
second story, we cannot admit that the motive is 
adequate, while in the first judgment remains sus- 
pended. A lifetime even a brief one of habit 
is doubtless an immense directing force, and the 
more we think of the psychological problem of " The 
Day of Their Wedding," the more we are inclined 
to admit the final resolution of the young people to 
be probable, if not inevitable. We are certainly 
not prepared for it by what goes before, and it 
comes to the consciousness with something like a 
shock, but reflection justifies it in considerable meas- 
ure. Both books are undoubtedly charming, en- 
livened as they are by gleams of humor, and suc- 
cessful as they are in the deft and subtle delineation 
of character. 

We have not heard from Mr. F. J. Stimson as 
much of late as we could have wished, for his work 
is always finely conceived and carefully wrought. 
It is true that jurisprudence has gained what liter- 
ature has lost, but that does not altogether console 
the lover of literature. " Pirate Gold," the novel 
with which Mr. Stimson has broken a prolonged 
silence, is a story of mercantile Boston in the ante- 
bellum days. It has little to do with pirates, and 
the title, although justified by the ill-gotten hoard 
that is one of the most important " properties " of 
the story, serves rather as a romantic fillip to the 
imagination than as an index to the nature of the

book. The love of an old man for an adopted child 
is the central theme, suggesting alternately " Silas 
Marner " and " Les Misdrables," and leading to a 
situation comparable in pathos with the closing 
chapters in the story of Jean Valjean. Perhaps 
the finest thing in the book is its portraiture of an 
old-time Boston merchant. The sketch is done with 
swift, incisive, sympathetic touches ; in short, with 
the art that conceals art so deftly that we realize 
only upon reflection how subtle the art is. Glimpses 
of the abolitionist agitation are also given in the 
later chapters, and the electrical tension of the time 
is admirably reproduced. 

The walking delegate has often appeared in Amer- 
ican fiction, but has been sketched with a master 
hand, as far as we know, in only two instances. One 
is the late Mr. Bunner's short story, " Zadoc Pine," 
the other is Mr. Hopkinson Smith's new novel, " Tom 
Grogan." The latter is a very different sort of book 
from any that Mr. Smith has previously given us ; 
it has a firmer grasp upon actuality, a more vital 
method of presentation, than even the story of our 
dear old friend Colonel Carter. Mr. Smith has 
taken his incidents from his experience as an en- 
gineer of public works, and his story deals with the 
cowardly efforts of a pack of " union " laborers to 
destroy the business of his independent and hard- 
working hero. The hero, by the way, is a heroine, 
for Tom Grogan is really Tom's widow, who takes 
her husband's name and carries on his carting busi- 
ness. She is a strongly conceived character, delin- 
eated with sympathetic art, and stands out in fine 
contrast to the miserable loafers and rascally poli- 
ticians who are leagued against her. Such a book 
is, we think, calculated to do good as a social tract, 
and we shall be surprised if it does not have some- 
thing of the influence of Reade's novel, " Pat Your- 
self in His Place," which deals, mutatis mutandis, 
with essentially the same subject. 

" The Damnation of Theron Ware " is by far the 
strongest work of fiction that Mr. Harold Frederic 
has yet produced ; it is, indeed, one of the most 
striking and impressive novels of the year, or of 
several years. The scene is laid in the region that 
the author knows so well Central New York 
and the action takes place, for the most part, in a 
town of some ten thousand inhabitants. Mr. Fred- 
eric has aimed to produce a great and typical pic- 
ture of American life, and an unerring instinct has 
taught him that such a picture must be concerned 
with the life of a small community rather than with 
the more attractive but also more sophisticated civ- 
ilization of the great cities. New York and Chicago 
are, after all, less typically American than Oshkosh 
and Kalamazoo, just as Paris is less typically French 
than Tours. It is in the small community that the 
mainsprings of a nation's strength are to be traced 
most distinctly and the elements of its weakness 
most clearly discerned, that its fundamental ideals 
are most naively offered to the view. Mr. Frederic's 
novel is a study of character projected upon a re- 
ligious background. Two forms of religious activity 



are given prominence, the narrow and colorless, but 
unquestionably native, orthodoxy of the primitive 
culture-stage in which the greater part of our pop- 
ulation still remains, and the more liberal but un- 
deniably alien ideal of the Church of Rome. A 
young Methodist minister, Theron Ware, represents 
the one, while the other is represented by a priest 
and by the fascinating woman whose influence brings 
about the minister's damnation. Anyone who has 
lived in a small town in the older and more settled 
section of the country knows how sharp is the con- 
trast between these two religious elements how each 
is to the other a world almost utterly unknown 
and must pay tribute of admiration to the penetra- 
tion with which the author of this book has entered 
into the life of both, and the skill with which he 
has brought them both to bear upon the character 
of Theron Ware. The book is, in this aspect, not con- 
troversial, but simply vital ; besides being one of the 
subtlest studies of moral disintegration that have 
been made. Weak and contemptible as is the nature 
of the minister, we are not left unpitying as we read 
of his downfall, for we feel that he is the sport of 
fate, and that his life might have been shaped to a 
nobler outcome. The tree of knowledge is not for 
him the tree of life, yet we cannot help thinking 
that it might have been so had his early environ- 
ment been a more wholesome one. The story of 
his final collapse is told with terrible power, and 
the effect is heightened by the tragic irony of the 
episodes that precede it. In its passionate aspect, 
the book strongly suggests the " Spring Floods " of 
Tourgue*nieff, for the movement is psychologically 
much the same. The workmanship of the novel is 
not in all respects praiseworthy ; some of the lesser 
characters are not perfectly realized, some of the 
threads are dropped, and some of the actions not 
adequately motivated. The scene, too, in which the 
first climax is reached may be reproached with 
touching upon the borders of the sensual, instead of 
remaining within the limits of the merely sensuous. 
But when all is said, the final impression is of a 
power that Mr. Frederic has not heretofore dis- 
played, and that has now earned for him a high 
place in American literature. We note that the En- 
glish publishers of this novel have chosen to give it a 
new title " Illumination " which suggests " The 
Marble Faun " and " Transformation," but which 
does not seem to have been a happy inspiration, 
although it strikes the ironical keynote of the book. 
Mr. Crawford's new novel is as neat in pattern as 
ever, flowing smoothly and decorously along for the 
proper number of pages, and then reaching the con- 
clusion that we have all the time known to be inev- 
itable. The scene is laid in Amalfi or, more ex- 
actly, in the Capuccini at Amalfi and the only 
characters that count are four, two elderly people, 
once married and afterwards divorced, and two 
young people, children of the former by second mar- 
riages, learning to love one another before knowing 
anything of the earlier relations of their respective 
parents. It is all very skilfully planned, and very

entertaining. The author is as inveterate a moral- 
izer as ever, and when he is not talking himself, his 
characters take their turn, and converse at great 
length without saying anything in particular. Of 
characterization in any deep sense there are few 
traces ; the revelations that one gets from this inter- 
minahle chatter are about as illuminating as the 
indications that might be derived from a minute 
inspection of the clothing worn by the speakers. 
The book is an almost perfect example of machine- 
made art. 

The Paris Commune of 1871 is likely in the course 
of time to yield as many good stories as any episode 
in modern history. Perhaps the best of them that 
has yet been told is " The Red Republic," by Mr. 
Robert W. Chambers. This novel is characterized 
by unusual fertility of invention and a brisk man- 
ner that keeps the interest from flagging for a mo- 
ment. The author has made a minute study of the 
scene and the subject. The day-by-day happenings 
of those terrible weeks are chronicled with the atten- 
tion to detail of a newspaper report. Many of the 
leaders of the Commune have a place in the narra- 
tive, prominent among them being the sinister figure 
of Raoul Rigault. Such episodes as the capture of 
the guns on Montmartre, the sortie toward Ver- 
sailles, and the crowning communistic infamy of the 
murder of Archbishop Darboy, are very vividly de- 
scribed. And through all the tale of horror there runs 
a thread of romance in the shape of one of the ten- 
derest of love-stories. A second novel by Mr. Cham- 
bers, called " A King and a Few Dukes," is almost 
equally interesting, although it is written with less 
care than the other, and although it is concerned 
with an imaginary series of happenings in the Bal- 
kan Peninsula rather than with the facts of actual 
history. It has something of the satirical vein of 
Mr. Bernard Shaw's comedy, "Arms and the Man," 
and is a good example of what may be called the 
bouffe variety of the historical novel. 

The fascination of the French Revolution for the 
novelist seems unabated, and it will be long before 
those few years that closed the last century a 
period perhaps richer in human interest than any 
other of equal length in modern history will cease 
to provide themes for romantic fiction. Yet often 
as the subject has been exploited, it has provided 
material for but few works that may in any sense 
be styled masterpieces. There is Hugo's supreme 
"Quatre-Vingt-Treize," and Dickens's "Tale of 
Two Cities," and Balzac's " Chouans," and Bulwer's 
" Zanoni," but hardly anything else of very high 
rank. Mr. Hatton's novel is of the purely conven- 
tional sort, and cannot be given much praise. A 
certain cleverness in the management of incident is 
about all that we may credit it with, and it makes 
a fairly readable but nowise impressive story. It 
is called " When Greek Meets Greek " probably be- 
cause the author, like many other people, fancies 
the phrase to be some sort of a quotation, which we 
beg leave to assure him it is not. 

Mr. Frankfort Moore's latest novel, " The Secret 



of the Court," is in a new manner, being nothing 
less than a tale of romantic mystery, after the fash- 
ion of Bulwer. The only trouble is that the mys- 
tery which is unearthed in Egypt, and concerns 
the resurrection of the dead proves quite unman- 
ageable, and forces the author to dispose of the pos- 
sessor of the secret by burning him up in his castle. 
The reader naturally expects something less hack- 
neyed than this, and is disappointed. 

A story of life in a coal-mining town in the north 
of England is offered us by Mr. W. E. Tirebuck. 
" Miss Grace of All Souls " is the title, the name 
indicating that the daughter of the vicar of All 
Souls Church is the heroine. As a local study the 
book shows close familiarity with the scenes it por- 
trays, and intimate knowledge of the colliery point 
of view. The dialect is something of a stumbling- 
block, but could hardly have been spared from a 
study aiming at fidelity to fact. Examination of 
the work shows it to be a socialistic tract almost un- 
disguised. The author permits sentiment to over- 
ride logic, and his feeling for ethical values is sin- 
gularly faulty. The case that he takes for discussion 
is that of the hypocritical mine-owner, callous to the 
sufferings of the men whom he employs, and bent 
only upon securing the largest personal profit from 
his business. He is represented as bringing about a 
widespread colliery strike in order that he may sell 
his large accumulation of products at a sharp advance. 
A twenty-five per cent reduction of wages is ordered, 
while no reduction is made in the cost of manage- 
ment, and the proprietor gains largely by the re- 
sulting distress. The chapter of horrors is filled by 
a cave-in, a flooded pit, and a riot suppressed by 
military force. The case presented by Mr. Tire- 
buck is a possible one, but we do not believe it to be 
typical. The statistics of such industrial struggles 
show us that managers as a rule submit to greatly 
reduced returns before they resort to the extreme 
measure of a reduction in wages, and that in many 
cases industries are kept in operation at a heavy 
loss in order that employment may be provided for 
the men. Mr. Tirebuck defeats his own purpose by 
his distorted presentation of the situation. Colors 
so thickly laid on, and so violently contrasted, make 
it impossible to view the work as either serious art 
or serious economics. Capitalists without the sense 
of responsibility toward their dependents, and labor- 
ers who are models of nearly all the virtues, may 
doubtless be found here and there, but they are the 
exception rather than the rule. There is, moreover, 
a subtle sort of immorality in setting, as the writer 
does, the impulsive sentimentality of the vicar's 
daughter against the maturer judgment of her 
father, and in claiming for her a sympathy that 
may well, in so complex a matter, be shared be- 
tween them. In this aspect, the book reminds us 
of a pernicious sort of Sunday-school literature in 
which the priggish and self-righteous child is rep- 
resented as sitting in judgment upon the well- 
meaning but worldly-minded parent, forgetting that 
obedience is the first of childish duties, and of course

not old enough to know that a child's conviction of 
what is right is more likely to be shallow dogmatism 
than anything else. Miss Grace, to be sure, is not 
exactly a child in years, but she is actuated by an 
essentially childish disregard of the logical condi- 
tions of the problem which she thinks so clear of so- 
lution. In the end, she marries one of her humble 
coal-mining friends, which is perhaps the best thing 
that could happen to her, however such a union 
offends the sense of fitness. 

Mr. C. F. Keary has done some good literary 
work in serious lines, but is hardly possessed of the 
gifts of the novelist. " Herbert Vanlennert " is a 
very long story more than five hundred pages 
long and one not easily to be read without a lib- 
eral exercise of the prerogative of skipping. Its 
manner is an attempted reproduction of the manner 
of Thackeray, and it is safe to say that without 
" Pendennis " this book could never have been 
written, but the frequent suggestions of so great an 
artist only emphasize the distance between this book 
and its evident model. Apart from its prolixity 
and incoherence, Mr. Keary's story is marred by 
one or two scenes that are conceived in extremely 
bad taste. It is essentially a story of English so- 
ciety, with an Afghan interlude supposed to devel- 
ope the manliness of the somewhat callow youth 
who serves as hero. There is a good deal of unde- 
niable cleverness about the book, as well as the sort 
of allusiveness which shows a man to have a good 
many intellectual interests and a fair degree of cul- 
ture. These qualities at least make it readable, de- 
void as it is of characterization in any high sense, 
or of style and symmetry. 

The prolixity of Mr. Blackmore is so pronounced 
that he can spread the simplest plot over the pages 
of the most voluminous novel. This is an artistic 
defect not wholly excused even by the shrewd 
humor and kindly human feeling always character- 
istic of his work. It might be assumed a priori 
that he would not be able to meet the requirements 
of the short story, which ought always to display 
rapidity of action and economy of expression. The 
assumption is certainly justified by the four stories 
now published in a single volume. Their interest 
is slight, and there is little art in their structure. 
The style alone saves them, as it has saved some of 
Mr. Blackmore's full-grown novels. 

There could not well be a sharper contrast than 
exists between the stories just referred to and those 
published by Mr. Quiller-Couch in his " Wandering 
Heath." Fragmentary as some of these are, they 
all exhibit the swift incisive touch of the man who 
weighs his words, and searches laboriously for the 
just expression. There is only one story, in the 
strictest sense " The Bishop of Eucalyptus " to 
be found in the collection; the other pieces are 
character -sketches, humorous fancies, and quaint 
bits of Cornish tradition. Humor is nearly always 
present, now and then rollicking, but more fre- 
quently subdued to an internal chuckle. We have 
enjoyed most of all the story of the Bishop, the 



startling tale of " The Captain from Bath," and the 
two delicious " Letters from Troy," descriptive of 
the impact of modern ideas upon that remote ham- 
let. The doctrinaire reformer might learn a lesson 
of the greatest value if he were only capable of 
learning lessons from this artfully artless narrative 
of Troy's temperance agitation and first parish 
council. 

" The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard," by Dr. A. 
Conan Doyle, can hardly be regarded as other than 
a pot-boiler, along with the Sherlock Holmes stories 
and other recent productions of this too prolific 
writer. The book contains eight stories, each an 
episode in the career of the supposititious narrator, 
who is a soldier of Napoleon, and is characterized 
mainly by the boastful Gascon spirit. His adventures 
are surprising enough, and he escapes from them 
creditably, if not always with success ; but one gets 
rather weary of his vaunts, and would gladly have 
him come to grief. The author's inventive powers 
are badly strained in the effort to keep up an inter- 
est in the exploits of his hero, and there is a good 
deal of melodrama about the book. 

Mr. Anthony Hope's " Comedies of Courtship " 
is a collection of six stories two fairly long ones 
and four short ones. The comedy of courtship, ac- 
cording to Mr. Hope, is chiefly to be found in the 
sort of situation that leads to the tragedy of Goethe's 
" Elective Affinities," with the important difference 
that the right people find each other before the mar- 
riage ceremony has taken place. The stories are 
sprightly and entertaining ; it requires a consider- 
able amount of intellectual agility to keep up with 
them, but there is fortunately no great demand upon 
the sympathies, and we can view with equanimity 
the transfer of undying love from one object to an- 
other that so often and so unexpectedly takes place. 

We have long known Professor C. G. D. Roberts 
for the foremost of Canadian poets, and the publi- 
cation of " Earth's Enigmas " now calls upon us to 
recognize him as a writer of a high order of imag- 
inative prose. Slight as these stories are for no 
less than fifteen of them are crowded within the 
limits of a very small volume they are noteworthy 
for their artistic finish and poetic feeling, no less 
than for the fidelity with which they picture Cana- 
dian landscape and character. There are beauti- 
ful dreamy pages in this little book, a fine sense of 
life under primitive conditions and enveloped in the 
atmosphere of romance. " A Tragedy of the Tides " 
is perhaps the gem of the collection. 

Very different from these so remote from us in 
space and time are the strictly modern stories in the 
volume just given us by Mr. Richard Harding Davis. 
" Cinderella," the first of them, is a Van Bibber 
story, and a rather flat one at that, compared with 
most of those that have preceded it. There are 
four others, three of which are readable, and the 
fourth wildly exciting. This story of " The Reporter 
Who Made Himself King " saw the light, we are 
told, in an earlier volume, but somehow escaped our 
attention. It is the " comedy of a consulate " on a

small Pacific island, and may be recommended with 
confidence to any reader who has a fairly developed 
sense of humor. We doubt if the author has ever 
spun a more fascinating yarn. 

The Youth of Parnassus," " The Will to Live," 
" The Claim of the Past " these are taking titles, 
and they fulfil their promise, although not exactly 
in the way one expects. For they turn out to be 
not stories in any very definite sense, but rather 
meditations, or at the most episodes. They are the 
work of a young man who knows his Oxford, and 
succeeds in conveying something of the charm (and 
the melancholy) of life in the ancient university 
quadrangles. The work is at times positively bril- 
liant as in the " Idyll " which sketches in swift 
sure lines a familiar type of the American girl 
and is always clever. " Buller Intervening," for 
example, is a sketch of a dozen pages only, but it has 
an idea, and treats it with singularly happy effect. 
We shall await with much interest the literary reap- 
pearance of Mr. Logan Pearsall Smith. 

Mr. Cram's " Black Spirits and White " offers us 
a collection of assorted ghosts European ghosts 
that harmonize with their environment of German 
castle and Italian convent. Some of them are too 
obviously theatrical to be convincing ; others are 
limned with considerable success. We think we 
like best the clammy and viscous ghost of " No. 252 
Rue M. le Prince," although the spirit that haunts 
" The White Villa " at Psestum has distinctly en- 
gaging qualities. Mr. Cram's descriptive and nar- 
rative text creates a fitting atmosphere for the super- 
natural visitants that appear in his pages, and he 
contrives more than once to produce a genuine thrill 
of awe and terror. WlLLIAM MOBTON PATNE . 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Among the latest volumes in the 
Agoodhistory Cambridge Historical Series, edited 

of Australasia. _ 

by Dr. G. W. Prothero, we are glad 
to commend " The History of the Australasian Col- 
onies " (Macmillan), by Professor Edward Jenks, a 
writer already known as a painstaking student of 
political science by an earlier work on the govern- 
ment of Victoria. The author has spent three years 
in Australia, and thus has been able to use the ar- 
chives at Sydney, Melbourne, and Wellington. The 
volume before us is an admirably concise and well 
constructed history of the group of communities 
linked together by allegiance to the British crown 
and the prevalence of British blood, manners, ideas, 
and hopes, chief among which is Australia, besides 
Tasmania, and the three islands known together as 
New Zealand. The author has avowedly limited 
the scope of his work, writing from the standpoint 
of the school which regards history as past politics 
and politics as present history. Hence he has paid 
close attention to the political and economic devel- 
opment of Australia. First tracing the growth of 



Popular 
discussions 
of Homer. 



Australia into five political states, he has shown how 
these states have reached their present position of 
self-governing and virtually independent commun- 
ities, though nominally colonies of England. What 
he has to say of the development of the cattle, wool, 
and (generally speaking) the agricultural industries, 
is by way of suggestive comment. The presence 
of the remarkable race known as the Maoris, the 
true natives of New Zealand, accounts for several 
problems in the history of New Zealand, legal, po- 
litical, and social, which the Australians had not to 
consider. Even to-day the Maoris possess large dis- 
tricts in the islands ; and they must be reckoned with 
for years to come. The best example of the author's 
power of analysis is found in the chapter entitled 
"Responsible Government and Modern Constitu- 
tions "; here he seems particularly strong. The con- 
cluding chapter is devoted to a brief presentation 
of such present-day problems as (i.) the question of 
colonial federation ; (ii.) the Pacific question as 
to which of the greater Powers shall exercise a con- 
trolling influence in the Pacific ; (iii. ) the Samoan 
difficulties ; and finally (iv.) the question of separat- 
ing northern from southern Queensland. Careless- 
ness has allowed " east " to stand on p. 4 for " west." 
A noticeably complete index and two good maps 
bring the volume to a close. 

" Art and Humanity in Homer " 
(Macmillan) is a pretty little pocket 
volume in which Professor William 
Cranston Lawton has collected some half dozen or 
more of his university extension lectures and "At- 
lantic " papers. " The Iliad as a Work of Art," 
"Womanhood in the Iliad," "Odysseus and Nau- 
sicaa," " The Homeric Underworld," these are 
some of the themes on which Professor Lawton dis- 
courses with his customary genial fluency and sym- 
pathetic appreciation. Technical erudition would 
have been out of place in papers whose purpose is 
to stimulate and guide the general reader in the 
intelligent enjoyment of translations. But the au- 
thor shows himself well informed about matters to 
which his limits permit him only to allude, and his 
taste and judgment are elegant and sound. We can- 
not speak as favorably of his metrical ear. The 
original English hexameters in which his copious 
citations are given are a sorry representation of the 
" strong-winged music of Homer." This is perhaps 
not his fault. He is attempting impossibilities. It 
is possible as a tour de force to write a good English 
hexameter composed of real dactyls and spondees. 
Witness Kingsley's 

" Lingered in rose-red rays on the peaks of Ionian mountains." 
to which it would be hypercritical to object that the 
I of Ionian is a trifle too long for the last syllable 
of a dactyl, and that its final syllable is made too 
heavy by the consonant in the next word. But 
neither Kingsley, nor Longfellow, nor Matthew 
Arnold, nor Mr. Lawton, can keep it up in the mon- 
osyllabic, consonantal Saxon diction of English poe- 
try. And it is pure illusion to suppose that the accent 



340

[June 1, 



can often be trusted to alter appreciably the abso- 
lute weights of syllables, or produce anything but a 
tantalizing semblance of that alternation of slow- 
paced spondee and light-tripping dactyl which con- 
stitutes the genius of the metre. 

For no one can a stronger claim be 
advanced to a place in the English 
Men of Action " series (Macmillan) 
than for Thomas Cochrane, known later by his title 
of Dundonald, a hero who disputes with Nelson the 
name of greatest among British sailors. The story 
of Dundonald's life as told by the Hon. J. W. For- 
tescue is one of intense interest, yet it is a sad one. 
It shows us a genius capable of the most astonish- 
ing achievements united with a character so undisci- 
plined that its possessor was cut off from the oppor- 
tunities of serving his country, of doing great things 
that would easily have come to him, while his life 
was embittered and nearly wrecked by the passion- 
ate quarrels into which he rushed at every turn. 
That he was usually right in his contentions only 
makes the pity greater, for patience and tact would 
have smoothed his way to success, while his insub- 
ordination and folly only set against him all those 
in authority and blocked his way. Even worse, in 
the intensity of his hatred for the administration he 
refused the offer of a fleet and a glorious oppor- 
tunity to serve his country, and chose instead to 
thwart and discredit by factious opposition the gov- 
ernment that had failed to give him what he thought 
his due. Driven from the service in England, he 
enlisted in turn in the service of Chili, Peru, Brazil, 
and Greece, in every case doing wonders, and freeing 
the South American states from Spain and Portugal 
in spite of their own cowardice, treachery, and self- 
ish stupidity. It is a satisfaction to learn that after 
many stormy years he was restored to the British 
service, and that his wrongs were righted in large 
measure. 

The two series of expository lectures 
o^. Poetical science delivered at Cam- 
bridge during the Michaelmas and 
Lent terms of the academic year 1885-86, by the 
late Sir J. B. Seeley, have been prepared for book 
publication by Professor Henry Sidgwick, and are 
issued under the title of " Introduction to Political 
Science" (Macmillan). The little book should be 
in the hands of every student of the subject. Polit- 
ical speculation is still so deeply vitiated by the more 
or less fanciful a priori theorizings of Rousseau and 
his predecessors that it is high time their scholastic 
brain-spinnings should give way to the fruits of a 
sounder method. A political science based on the 
widest possible induction from historical and an- 
thropological facts, from the phenomena displayed 
by the crudest tribal polities down to those of the 
most highly organized and intellectualized modern 
states, was Seeley's ideal. The lectures enforce and 
illustrate throughout his familiar dual doctrine : 
(1) that the true method of studying political sci- 



ence is an essentially historical method; and (2) 
that the right method of studying political history 
is to study it as material for political science. No 
one is likely nowadays to question seriously the 
first proposition, whatever may be thought of the 
second. 

A somewhat lengthy categorical 

r . e P lv to . Herr Max Nordau's sensa- 
tional diatribe against modern civili- 
zation is made by an anonymous but evidently prac- 
tised writer, under the title of " Regeneration " 
(Putnam). The book is furnished with a pungent 
introduction by Professor Nicholas Murray Butler, 
who moderately commends his author, and scores 
Herr Nordau pretty severely on his own account. 
" Degeneration," says Professor Butler, "constitutes 
Nordau. He is himself an abnormality and a path- 
ological type. Every large hospital for the insane 
knows his representative the one sane man in a 
world of lunatics." The novelty of Herr Nordau's 
pseudo-scientific paradoxes has worn off, and refut- 
ing him will seem to the class he pretends to repre- 
sent very like slaying the dead. There may be, 
however, some timid souls still overawed by his sci- 
entific position, and shocked at the strange shapes 
they have seen in his warped and fantastic mirror ; 
and these should derive comfort from the sane views 
and common-sense arguments of the present volume. 
Says Professor Butler again : " The author of ' Re- 
generation' is successful in turning the flank of 
Nordau's attacking forces at more points than one. 
He is able at times, without over-exertion, to con- 
vict Nordau not only of lack of knowledge, but of 
what is far worse knowledge of things that are 
not true." 



Origins of 
Folk-lore. 



An " Introduction to Folk-lore," by 
Mr. Marion Roalf e, is issued by Mr. 
David Nutt in London and Messrs. 
Scribner's Sons in New York. The author's pre- 
face begins with the words, " This little book pre- 
tends, without arrogance, to answer a question, not 
infrequently heard, namely, What is folk-lore?" 
The point of view is anthropological only. The au- 
thor states that the treatment has been profoundly 
influenced by Tyler, Spencer, and Lang. "The 
Separable Soul," " Animal Ancestors," " Animism," 
" The Other World," " Magic," are titles of chap- 
ters presenting a considerable mass of material illus- 
trating the thought and philosophy of savages and 
barbarians. Clear summaries of the argument at 
the ends of chapters would have greatly improved 
the book. The reader who wishes to profit by the 
discussion must prepare such summaries for him- 
self. The style is clever and the data are usually 
trustworthy. The author is always unhappy, how- 
ever, in stating evidence from geology or archae- 
ology. The best and most practical chapter in the 
book is the final one, where the data already pre- 
sented, and presumably digested by the reader, are 
applied to the elucidation of myths and folk-tales.

BRIEFER MENTION. 

A new edition of Cooper is not untimely in this age 
of reprints, and Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, with their 
" Mohawk" edition, have seized the obvious opportunity. 
There are to be thirty-two volumes, at $1.25 each. 
Judging from The Spy," the first volume to be pub- 
lished, the edition will prove a satisfactory one. Typo- 
graphy, paper, and binding are all to be commended as 
simple, dignified, and attractive. The volume has a 
frontispiece illustration, and no apparatus of any sort, 
except the original preface of the author. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the publishers of a 
handsome two-volume edition of " The Bible in Spain." 
The work will not only please all Borrovians, but many 
others are likely to learn from it the peculiar fascina- 
tion that Borrow exercises over those who make his ac- 
quaintance. The editing of this edition was one of the 
last pieces of work done by the late Ulike Ralph Burke, 
who supplied an introduction, footnotes, and a glossary. 
There are a few illustrations, but not as many as we 
wish there might have been. There is also a map for 
the purpose of enabling readers to trace the course of 
Borrow's wanderings. 

The first number of a series of "Economic Studies," 
to be published by the American Economic Association, 
has just appeared from the press of Messrs. Macmillan 
& Co. It comprises two papers: " The Theory of Eco- 
nomic Progress," by Dr. John B. Clark; and " The Re- 
lation of Changes in the Volume of the Currency to 
Prosperity," by General Francis A. Walker. As a sup- 
plement to this series we have a " Hand-Book of the 
American Economic Association " for 1896, with con- 
stitution, membership list, and abstracts of the papers 
read at Indianapolis last December, on the occasion of 
the Eighth Annual Meeting. 

Friends of President M. W. Stryker of Hamilton 
College will be glad to know that he has collected some 
fifteen orations and addresses, delivered by himself in 
the years since 1893, which appear in a volume entitled 
" Hamilton, Lincoln, and Other Addresses," just pub- 
lished by Messrs. William T. Smith & Co. (Utica, 
N. Y.). The edition is limited to one thousand copies. 
These addresses deal with a variety of subjects bio- 
graphical, educational, political, religious ; they are often 
marked by passages of very vigorous thought which 
make them well worthy of preservation. The place of 
honor is very appropriately given to an address on Al- 
exander Hamilton. 

The reprinters have at last got around to Captain 
Marryatt, and it was time that they should. Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co. in this country, in cooperation with 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. in England, have planned 
an edition, in twenty-two volumes, of the novels of this 
ever-popular writer, to appear at the rate of two or 
three volumes monthly. " Peter Simple " and " Frank 
Mildmay " inaugurate the series, and show us how taste- 
ful is to be the execution of this noteworthy project. 
The books are bound in dark green English buckram, 
they have gilt tops and rough edges, and are beautifully 
printed on Dickinson paper. Each volume has three 
etchings, and an ex libris design on the inside of the 
cover. Mr. Richard Brimley Johnson is the editor of 
the series, and contributes to " Peter Simple " a careful 
critical and bibliographical introduction. The frontis- 
piece of this volume is very properly a portrait of Mar- 
ryatt. We congratulate the publishers upon the success- 
ful inauguration of this notable undertaking. 



iLlTERABY NOTES. 

"George's Mother," a new novel by Mr. Stephen 
Crane, is about to be published by Mr. Edward Arnold. 
Messrs. Curtis & Co., Boston, publish a pretty pam- 
phlet on Mural Painting in the Boston Public Library," 
written by Mr. E. F. Fenollosa. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers have published a new 
edition, at the popular price of one dollar, of Mr. H. D. 
Lloyd's " Wealth against Commonwealth." 

" The Southern and Western Boundaries of Michi- 
gan," by Miss Annah May Soule, is a monograph just 
published by the Michigan Political Science Association. 
" On Germinal Selection as a Source of Definite Var- 
iation," by Dr. August Weismann, is issued by the Open 
Court Publishing Co. in their " Religion of Science " 
library. 

" Desperate Remedies," with an etched frontispiece 
and the map of Wessex, is the latest volume in the 
library edition of Mr. Hardy's novels, published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Publication of "The Idyls of the King," with the 
story of " Balin and Balan " inserted at the proper place, 
is continued in two new volumes of the " People's " 
Tennyson, from the press of Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 
A "History of Elementary Mathematics," by Dr. 
Florian Cajori, and a volume of selections from Chaucer, 
edited, with much apparatus, by Professor Hiram Cor- 
son, are two interesting announcements made by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. 

The Ben Franklin Co. of Chicago publishes a pam- 
phlet containing the address on Franklin made by Mr. 
Joseph Medill last January before the Old-Time Prin- 
ters' Association. The pamphlet has half-a-dozen illus- 
trations, mostly portraits. 

An announcement of extraordinary interest is that of 
the coming publication, in " Cosmopolis," of the corre- 
spondence of Tourgue'nieff with Flaubert, Dumas fils, 
Maupassant, Madame Viardot, M. Zola, and others. 
The publication will probably begin in July. 

A series of " Stories by English Authors " has been 
started by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Each vol- 
ume contains stories of a particular country, England 
and Ireland being the special subjects of the two thus 
far issued. The stories are by the best writers, living 
and dead. 

" Reprinted Pieces, and The Lazy Tour of Two Idle 
Apprentices " is the complex legend upon the title-page 
of the latest volume in the Macmillan popular edition 
of Dickens. The papers are dated from 1850 to 1869, 
and are reprinted in chronological order. They include 
a certain amount of matter that is practically new. 

Two comedies by Miguel Sanchez, "La Isla Bdr- 
bara " and " La Guarda Cuidadosa," have been edited 
by collation of the seventeenth century editions and man- 
uscripts, and published by Dr. Hugo A. Rennert, under 
the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. As 
works of a forerunner of Lope de Vega, these comedies 
are of great value to the student of Spanish literature. 
A prize of fifty dollars is offered by Prof. A. S. Cook 
of Yale University for the best unpublished poem, of 
not more than one hundred lines in length, upon some 
subject connected with history or art, which shall be 
submitted by the writer on or before May 15, 1897. 
Competition is open to students in the University in all 
departments. The award will be made by a committee 
consisting of Messrs. Edmund Clarence Stedman,

Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and Francis Fisher Browne. 
If none of the poems possesses sufficient merit, the prize 
will not be awarded. 

" The Prose Tales of Alexander Poushkin," in a trans- 
lation by Mr. T. Eeane (Macmillan), is published as a 
volume of the Bohn Library. The same translation, 
issued in another form, was reviewed by us some time 
ago, but we note a few pieces that we do not remem- 
ber to have seen in the earlier edition. " The Captain's 
Daughter," of course, occupies the place of honor in 
the collection. 

It is interesting to note the present state of the " Ox- 
ford English Dictionary " as set forth recently in an 
official circular. The publication is in Volumes at $13.00 
each, Parts at $3.25 each, and, for the later instalments, 
Quarterly Sections at 60 cents each. The letters A and 
B may be had in one volume, and C in another. A, B, 
C, most of D, E, and a part of F may be had in ten parts. 
D and F, as far as they have progressed, may also be 
had in nine of the quarterly sections. 6 and H are in 
preparation, the former letter by Mr. Henry Bradley, 
the latter by Dr. Murray. The price of the work thus 
far published (four letters and parts of two others), is 
$36.40. Messrs. Macmillan & Co. are the American 
agents.

A Turkish Story. By"ADAUsx." Crown 8vo, 81.50. 
" This handsomely printed volume is reported as the literary work of 
a young Turkish lady, who from necessity writes under a nom deplume. 
The manuscript comes to the American publisher in English in her own 
handwriting. It is marked for its literary elegance. Besides being a 
very charming love story, it reveals life in the Turkish harem, and the 
manners and customs of the Turkish people, and in this sense it is pro- 
foundly interesting and instructing." Chicago Inter Ocean. 

THE NEW VIRTUE. 

A Novel. By Mrs. OSCAR BEBRINGBB. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
" In spite of the plot the tone of the story is moral. Vice is never 
planted before one in gay colors. When it stalks into a chapter it is 
sombre, sad, and foreboding. The sins are lost in obscurity, covered over 
in mystery. ' The New Virtue ' is a wholesome book, and suggests a fund 
of worldly wisdom." Chicago Record.

" There is no doubt that this is a striking book. The story it has to 
tell is thoroughly original and unconventional, while the manner of tell- 
ing it shows much restrained power." London Daily Telegraph.

THE 

STEARNS BICYCLE 



IS 



The Epitome of Comfort, 

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the "easy-running Stearns"; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, the better it is liked.

WEIR OF HERMISTON. By ROBERT Louis STEVENSON. 12mo, gilt top, $1.50. 

Mr. STEVENSON said : " It will be my best -work." 

Mr. HENRY JAMES: "The beauty of the thing had the effect of rendering doubly heart-breaking, as one read, the 
extinction of a talent that could still give one such a sense of freshness and life, of not yet having played, as it were, its 
highest card. I got from it a sense of new resources altogether ; of his striking a new chord. . . . What I allude to more 
particularly is what he seems to have been intending in the figure of the elder woman. That intention was surely one of 
the finest poetically, pictorially speaking, was n't it quite the finest that ever guided his pen ? " 

SIDNEY COLVIN : ' ' Surely no son of Scotland has died, leaving with his last breath a worthier tribute to the land he loved. ' ' 

POEMS AND BALLADS. By ROBERT Louis STEVENSOX. 12mo, $1.50. 

Lovers oi Mr. Stevenson's writings will welcome this dainty and attractively bound volume, which comprises all the poems included in 
"A Child's Garden of Verses," " Ballads," " Underwoods," and over forty pieces of verse written since the publication of those volumes. 

*#* Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons having recently acquired the rights to the publication of THE V AILIM A LETTERS, two volumes, 
$2.25; THE AMATEUR EMIGRANT, $1.25; THE EBB TIDE, $1.25; MACAIRE, $1.00, are now the publishers in this country of all 
of Mr. Stevenson's works. 

THE LIFE OF JAMES McCOSH. A Record Chiefly Autobiographical. Edited by Prof. WILLIAM 
-MiLLiGAN SLOAXE. Illustrated with portraits. 8vo, $2.50 net. 

This volume has been in the main compiled from papers left by Dr. McCosh. Large portions are his personal reminiscences, in his own 
words ; while the chapters which, for the sake of completeness, have been added by the editor, follow closely the ample material afforded by 
letters, printed speeches, and published articles. 

A LADY OF QUALITY. By Mrs. FRAXCES HODGSOX BURXETT. 12mo, $1.50. 

I. ZANGWILL, in The Critic : It appears to me the most interesting and remarkable thing Mrs. Burnett has done. It will add a new field 
to her already ample province. If its teaching be more sentimental than scientific, there is a vivid interest in its episodes ; and if one of its 
best scenes was partially anticipated in the life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and the murder incident anticipated in ' Izehl,' by Armand 
Silvestre, this only proves how true it is in some parts and how dramatic in others." 

CINDERELLA, and Other Stories. By RICHARD HARDIXG DAVIS. 12mo, $1.00. 

' ' They are very good in their genre, which is Mr. Davis's own especially ' An Assisted Emigrant,' which is very poetic in conception and 
well carried out. Taken altogether, this is a most satisfactory book, for there will be many to rejoice at Van Bibber's reappearance." Critic.

DROCH, in Life. 

THE TALE OF BALEN. By ALGERXOX CHARLES SWIXBURXE. 12mo, $1.50. 

The most important work that Mr. Swinburne has written in several years. It consists of Sir Thomas Malory's story, told in an elaborate, 
rhymed measure, which, however, keeps close to the original. Both in scheme and method the poem is an entirely new manifestation of Mr. 
Swinburne's genius, and it will arouse fresh enthusiasm among his many admirers. 

THE WORKS OF MAX BEERBOHM. I2mo, $1.25. 

The essays composing this volume are of unique quality. They treat of Brummell, Count D'Orsay, George the Fourth, Cosmetics, and 
other topics allied by the common element of dandyism, and are written in a vein of exceedingly refined and elaborate literary dilettanteism. 
Mr. Beerbohm is first of all a literary artist, but his critical powers are proportionally keen, and his essays will be valued for their substance 
as well as favored for their style.

" This story by J. L. Allen is one of the gems of the season. 
It is artistic in its setting, realistic and true to nature and life 
in its descriptions, dramatic, pathetic, tragic in its incidents, 
indeed a veritable gem that must become classic. It is difficult 
to give an outline of the story ; it is one of the stories which 
do not outline ; it must be read." Boston Daily Advertiser.

charm of Mr. Allen's delineative and narrative powers, and 
one reads the story with a breathless human interest to the 
very end." The Chicago Tribune.

THE DIAL'S SCORE OF VOLUMES. 

If volumes meant years, THE DIAL would 
just now be entering upon the year of its ma- 
jority. The present issue completes the twen- 
tieth volume of the review, and carries it well 
into the seventeenth year of its existence. This 
discrepancy between years and volumes results, 
of course, from the fact that THE DIAL began 
as a monthly, and became afterwards a semi- 
monthly. The first stage of its career extended 
from 1880 to 1892; the second stage has now 
covered four years. Since each of its score of 
volumes includes twelve parts, this issue of 
June 16, 1896, is reckoned as the two hundred 
and fortieth, while the aggregate number of 
pages is about seven thousand. 

Throughout all this period THE DIAL has 
remained under the same editorial manage- 
ment. During the first twelve years it bore 
the imprint of a well-known firm of book- 
publishers ; since then it has been issued by 
The Dial Company, incorporated in 1892 under 
the laws of Illinois. This transfer of publica- 
tion meant, as our older readers are well aware, 
no essential changes in the character of the 
paper except those naturally resulting from 
enlarged opportunities and resources. Begin- 
ning with September 1, 1892, THE DIAL be- 
came a semi-monthly, and added several new 
features, the most noteworthy of them being 
the leading editorial articles that have since 
appeared with every issue. It was felt by the 
editors that a critical journal devoted to the 
interests of literature should have, no less than 
the political or religious publication, a stand- 
point of its own, and that the general field of 
literary discussion offered, no less than any 
other, opportunities for the enunciation and 
defense of important principles in criticism, 
education, and public affairs. 

The editorial feature thus established was a 
new departure in critical periodicals of the 
class to which THE DIAL belongs, and abund- 
ant evidence of its acceptability has been af- 
forded by private communications and public 
comment upon our leaders of the past four 
years. The scope of this publication, broadly 
conceived, embraces many subjects besides 
those of strictly literary concern. Education, 
library management, important art movements,

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



the relations of scholarship to public affairs, 
the questions of copyright and the taxation of 
knowledge, and all other matters affecting the 
higher interests of culture, rightfully belong, 
and have upon appropriate occasions been 
brought, within its purview. Upon all of these 
subjects, and many others as well, we have 
sought to give expression to the sober intelli- 
gence of the nation, and to voice the lasting 
sentiments of the judicious rather than to echo 
the cry of the masses for the moment. Indeed, 
the leading editorials of THE DIAL, considered 
as a whole, may be taken as our confession of 
faith in questions of culture, as an index of 
those principles and ideals for which the re- 
view stands and may be expected to stand. 

In the performance of its function as a re- 
view of current publications, THE DIAL has 
sought to secure in all departments criticism 
that is both competent and readable, that is 
uninfluenced by prejudice, that is not weak- 
ened by the aimless sort of impressionism which 
so often usurps the name of criticism, that 
directs attention to the book under discussion 
rather than to the writer of the notice, and that 
tries to be as generous and appreciative as pos- 
sible without allowing inaccuracy, sciolism, and 
slovenliness to go uncensured. The list of spe- 
cial authorities who have contributed reviews 
to our columns is a very long and distinguished 
one, and includes the names of many scholars 
who stand foremost in their respective depart- 
ments of learning. It may be worth while to 
say, in this connection, that the unsigned re- 
views, or u Briefs," although editorial in " style," 
are prepared by a great number of hands, and 
are assigned with no less care than is exercised 
in the case of the longer articles. This method 
of securing reviews, of course, makes it impos- 
sible for us to notice books without some delay, 
for promptitude is to be had only at the sacri- 
fice of deliberate and authoritative judgment, 
and we are content to leave to the daily news- 
papers the foolish ambition to rival one another 
in the speed with which they herald the advent 
of the new books, and the facility with which 
they produce opinions that may be read to-day 
but will surely be forgotten to-morrow. 

It has often been assumed, by persons un- 
familiar with the work of THE DIAL, that it 
must give undue attention to the intellectual 
interests of the region in which it is produced. 
We need hardly say to any of our readers that 
this assumption is quite unwarranted, or that 
our field is as wide as the country itself. Al- 
though it is published in what New Englanders 



call the West, and in what publishers know as 
the great book-consuming centre of the Repub- 
lic, its constituency is as much Eastern as 
Western, and its subscribers are pretty evenly 
distributed over all the States and Territories. 
Indeed, the charge has come more than once 
from Western literary coteries that THE DIAL 
ignores the literary product of the section in 
which its home has been made, and recognizes 
only work that has won the approval of the 
older centres of culture. This foolish accusa- 
tion is best offset by the equally foolish one, 
now and then made in New York or Boston, 
that THE DIAL is the " literary champion of the 
West," and is jealous of the preeminence of 
Eastern men of letters. The simple truth of 
the matter is that we have never had, and never 
shall have, but one standard of judgment, the 
standard by which all work, good or bad, should 
be measured ; and that a book's place of origin 
never counts for a feather's weight in THE 
DIAL'S scale of criticism. 

We may perhaps be pardoned the confession 
of a little pride in contemplation of the twenty 
completed volumes of THE DIAL, and in recol- 
lection of the difficulties that have beset the 
enterprise during the sixteen years of its his- 
tory. It was no easy matter to win for a paper 
of purely intellectual appeal the support and 
the position that have been won for THE DIAL 
during these sixteen years, or to resist the temp- 
tation to bid for popularity at the sacrifice, in 
some measure, of the high ideals set for the 
journal at the start. As a record of American 
literary activity during nearly two decades of 
the century, our score of volumes are, we be- 
lieve, unsurpassed in value, and we take par- 
ticular satisfaction in the thought that, pre- 
served for reference as they are in most of the 
large public libraries, and fully catalogued in 
such works as Poole's " Index," they will prove 
useful to the future student of American litera- 
ture, as they have been helpful to readers of 
their own time seeking guidance in current lit- 
erature and in the selection of books to add to 
the library. 



SHAKESPEARE IN CHICAGO. 

Whatever our opinion as to the modern deca- 
dence of the stage, we must admit that in the depart- 
ment of Shakespearian drama Chicagoans have 
never enjoyed a more extended or more varied sea- 
son than that of 1895-96. 

Between the months of September and June the 
city has been visited by Mr. Frederick Warde, Mr. 



THE DIAL 



349 



Louis James, Sir Henry Irving, and Mr. Thomas 
Keene, veterans the quality of whose art is familiar 
to all ; Miss Ada Rehan and Mrs. Julia Mario we- 
Taber have appeared in Shakespearian roles, the 
former lady having practically opened the season 
with a three- weeks engagement in September and 
now closing it with a visit of a fortnight in June ; 
Mr. Walker Whiteside, Mr. Otis Skinner, and Mr. 
Robert Mantell have maintained their places as 
honest exponents of the classic drama, while Mr. 
Oeston Clarke and the younger Salvini have made 
courageous and not uninteresting essays in the same 
ambitious field, however rash and ill-judged their 
attempts may have seemed to be. Thus, eleven 
players of excellent repute have during the year 
submitted their interpretations of Shakespeare, con- 
ventional or new, to more or less critical audiences 
in Chicago. It may be added that notwithstanding 
the abnormal patronage accorded by large and 
.perhaps not less critical audiences to vaudeville 
and the " continuous show " with which Chicago has 
been afflicted no more than other American cities, 
these important engagements, with hardly an excep- 
tion, proved financially successful. 

The following tabulated statement of plays pro- 
duced, the number of performances, the actors and 
their dates, will be found of interest. It is under- 
stood that many other standard plays of the old

That is to say: thirteen of the best of Shake- 



speare's plays have been set upon our boards, and 
the number of performances gives an aggregate of 
ninety. We have had two Richards, two Macbeths, 
two Rosalinds. Three companies have appeared in 
one form or another of " The Taming of the Shrew "; 
two companies in " Romeo and Juliet." There have 
been seen three Othellos, five Shylocks, and seven 
Hamlets. From September 25 to October 12, Shake- 
speare was played continuously for three weeks in 
Chicago, Miss Rehan and Mrs. Taber appearing for 
two weeks of the three, simultaneously at different 
houses. Beginning again on January 27 there were 
performances continuing three weeks to February 
15. Mr. Walker Whiteside, Mr. Otis Skinner, and 
Mr. Creston Clarke were all playing in the city at 
this' time. Daring these three weeks, " Hamlet " 
was given fourteen times, and twice the theatre- 
goer had his choice of two interpretations. In 
March there were thirteen performances of Shake- 
speare ; and in April, sixteen. There was at least 
one performance in each month of the season except 
November. We rather doubt if any other city out- 
side of Germany can make as remarkable a show- 
ing as this. 

Of the varying values of these engagements it is 
not necessary to speak ; comparison with the past 
would also be gratuitous. The mere fact that the 
record stands as it does is a direct encouragement 
to those who love the true art of the stage in its 
most admirable expression; it also supplies the 
strongest possible argument for disproving the com- 
plete degeneracy of our stage and the assumed gen- 
eral decadence of theatrical taste at the present time.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE PARENTHETICAL ' SIC ' IN CRITICISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

In a communication in your issue of May 16, Mr. F. H. 
Teall indulges in a form of criticism, as annoying as it is 
uncalled for, which may be styled the parenthetical sic; 
and as the subject of the criticism is taken from an arti- 
cle by me, I crave the indulgence of a little space in 
which to enter protest. It is bad enough for the reviewer 
of a book to avail himself of this form of criticism; for 
anyone else to use it is impertinent, using the word, 
of course, in its literal sense. 

As regards the special points to which Mr. Teall takes 
exception, the first, the phrase " little far from criminal," 
might perhaps be improved, though I should hesitate to 
entrust the improving to a writer who uses so dreadful 
a phrase as " to exploit " ; the second is a case of incom- 
plete ellipsis; the third (which my critic introduces with 
that objectionable French phrase, en passant) is hardly 
met by using " the initiatory word notwithstanding," 
whatever an " initiatory word " may be. As to the " in- 
ference naturally drawn from this criticism namely, 
that Mr. White asserts that little annotation is neces- 
sary," I can only say that my statement was based wholly 
on Mr. White's practice, not at all on his theory. 

While I agree with Mr. Teall that the dictionaries

THE DIAL 



[June 16,. 



often set up a man of straw, I beg leave to differ with 
him about the meaning of admittance in "The Merry 
Wives." Elsewhere in Shakespeare this word is un- 
doubtedly used in its modern sense, but both here and 
in a later scene in the same play it certainly has the force 
of fashion or good form, as we should say now, that 
which admits one to good society. 

In conclusion I would mildly protest against the too 
frequent carelessness of writers in the matter of refer- 
ences, of which Mr. Teall's article furnishes a fair ex- 
ample. Of the five quotations from Shakespeare occur- 
ring there, two, or forty per cent, are incorrectly given, 
the passage from " Cymbeline " being from the third 
instead of the fourth scene of the first act, and the same 
being true of the extract from " Measure for Measure." 
The " p'rythee " in the latter the writer is perhaps not 
responsible for, though the apostrophe is of course not 
necessary. No more valuable advice was ever given to 
a literary young man than that of Dr. Bouth : " Always 
verify your citations."

THE PASSIVE VOICE WITH AN OBJECT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Caskie Harrison did well to call attention, in your 
journal lately, to the fact that such sentences as " he was 
asked a question " are warranted by good English usage 
for centuries back. As those who object to this con- 
struction, however, generally treat it as an absurdity 
from the logical standpoint, Mr. Harrison might have 
gone further and shown the inherent weakness of their 
logic. 

The difficulty with such critics is that they have not 
gone far enough in their linguistic investigations to dis- 
cover that a verb may be passive with reference to one 
person or thing without sustaining the same relation to 
every other person or thing with which the sentence may 
bring it into contact. When, from the active standpoint, 
we think of an officer giving a soldier his discharge, our 
conception is of an action affecting both the soldier and 
the discharge, the latter the more directly of the two. 
Now we change the point of view, and think of the sol- 
dier as the subject, saying that the soldier was given 
his discharge. Custom has decreed that the voice-form 
of the verb shall be governed by the subject, and so our 
critic raises his hands in holy horror at the outrageous 
anomaly of a passive verb with an object. The only 
anomaly is that in this age it should escape the notice of 
any fairly educated person that the relation of the verb 
has been changed with reference to but one of the 
two things (or persons) involved. To go back to the 
illustration, the discharge is evidently as much the 
object of the action as before, and rightly remains un- 
changed. 

In explaining this to a class, I should not say that 
when the voice of the verb is changed to the passive the 
accusative in question is retained ; this leads to the false 
idea that such a construction presupposes, in actual 
usage, the corresponding active locution. In ninety-nine 
cases out of a hundred, neither speaker nor hearer gives 
the slightest trace of thought to the active form. How- 
ever secondary the construction may be in its origin, it 
stands now upon its own basis in actual usage. The 
pupil should be told boldly that the accusative is the 
object of the verb; and after he has come to apprehend 
the fact by a common-sense examination of the meaning 
of the sentence, he may then be given an account of the 



active form into which the thought may be thrown. At 
the same time, it is well that his attention should b& 
called to the futile efforts of the class of critics by whom 
we are denied the right to this logical and well-accredited 
form of speech. 

By the way, have these critics realized that such sen- 
tences as " He has been told to go," " I was taught to 
sing," etc., are logically in the same category as the 
expressions which they condemn ? Or is it one thing to 
be taught language and quite another thing to be taught 
to understand language ? In one sense, at least, it cer- 
tainly is; and with this suggestion as to the origin of the- 
criticisms which called forth Mr. Harrison's letter, I 
must close. -yf jj j_

GERMAN PHILOLOGY IN SHAKESPEARE 

CRITICISM. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

It is surprising to find in an article under such a head- 
ing as " Shakespeare in Lexicography " (THE DIAL, 
May 16) no mention whatever of the most important 
of all dictionaries to the special student of the great 
dramatist, the " Shakespeare-Lexicon " of Alexander 
Schmidt, published twenty years ago in Koenigsburg, 
Germany. A knowledge of that work would have pre- 
pared Mr. Teall for a more intelligent discussion of the 
vocabulary of Shakespeare. Schmidt has, no doubt, 
erred at times in the creation of too many Shakespearian 
meanings of the same word. He realizes but imperfectly 
distinctions in the force of certain words in Elizabethan 
and nineteenth-century English. But to a German giv- 
ing English definitions to English words, more than this, 
may cheerfully be pardoned for the sake of the valuable 
material he has so arranged that one may, in many 
cases, let one's own discretion be one's tutor, spare a 
great deal of sheer memorization, and avoid thresh- 
ing general dictionaries that distinguish but scrappily 
between the English of our age and that of Shake- 
speare. 

Let us consult Schmidt concerning two of the pass- 
ages quoted by Mr. Teall. In " The Merry Wives of 
Windsor " (Act II., scene 2), Ford commends Falstaff 
as a gentleman " of great admittance." Schmidt defines 
" admittance " as " permission to enter, reception." 
Passages cited include " What admittance ? " (" Love's 
Labour's Lost," II., 1) explained as " What reception 
did you meet with?" and the peculiar expressions "Any 
tire of Venetian admittance " (" Merry Wives," III., 3), 
explained as " received, in fashion at Venice," and " of 
great admittance " (in the passage under discussion), 
explained as " admitted to the company and converse 
of great persons." That the last explanation is correct, 
is plainly shown by the context. That it differs for the 
better from Mr. Teall's "commanding much admit- 
tance," is equally clear. A more concise explanation 
than Schmidt's would have been " of admittance to the 
great." This would have shown that admittance has, 
as Mr. Teall says, its present meaning, " permission to 
enter," and that " the part of the sentence that needs 
explanation is the two words of great" words which 
Mr. Teall has not explained correctly. 

Turning to the word divorce, I find in Schmidt three 
definitions: (1) "Legal dissolution of the bonds of 
matrimony," (2) "Any separation of love," and (3) 
" That which separates." Of the last (given also by the 
International Dictionary), Mr. Teall says: " The word 
was never used and never could be used in this sense." 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



351 



How about Timon's apostrophe to the exhumed gold 
< Timon of Athens," IV., 3)? 

" thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce 
'Twixt natural son and sire ! " 

So extraordinary is Mr. Teall's denial of the possi- 
bility of divorce meaning " that which separates," that 
-we may expatiate a little. In the appendix to Schmidt's 
Lexicon (p. 1421) is the following remark: u The kind 
of metonymy called Abstraclum pro Concrete is common 
to all languages, and scarcely to be numbered among 
the peculiarities of poetical license, but no poet has been 
nearly so bold in it as Shakespeare." The subjoined 
passages are instructive. Abstract nouns are still used 
in calling names. We do not wonder at finding Ther- 
mites calling to Ajax, " Do rudeness, do camel." A re- 
markable instance of the same thing is Juliet's calling 
the Nurse " Ancient damnation! " Expressions like 
" Farewell, fair cruelty! " and " Get thee to yond same 
sovereign cruelty!" were perhaps of influence on Sir 
Piercie Shafton, whose " My most dear Discretion! " and 
" Ha, my Rusticity! " far enough removed from genuine 
euphuism, are a better reproduction of the foppish Eliza- 
bethan than has always been admitted. 

Schmidt gives passages illustrating the metonymy in 
profusion. I should like to call attention to two beau- 
tiful passages in which I think " death " is used for " the 
dead." They illustrate how fine and poetical this use 
of language may be when it arises from the uncon- 
scious instincts of inspiration. The first is from " Comus " 
(560-562): 

" I was all ear, 

And took in strains that might create a soul 

Under the ribs of death." 

The other is from "Othello" (Act II., scene 1): 

" O my soul's joy I 

If after every tempest come such calms 
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death ! " 

It is not impossible to take these as personifications, but 
until I meet with some representation of Death as a 
sleeper I shall prefer my own interpretation, of the latter 
passage at least. 

I have already exceeded my limits, but may be per- 
mitted to add that Schmidt's discussion of adjectives in 
the Appendix (pp. 1415 et seq.} makes clear many such 
usages as " of great admittance " and " the long divorce 
of steel." The latter means " the axe that causes long 

divorce."

THE seventh volume of "Germania" is completed with 
the April issue, and a glance over the year's numbers 
deepens our impression of the usefulness of the period- 
ical to students of the German language. Each num- 
ber contains a selection of good classical reading-matter, 
carefully annotated, together with simpler reading for 
those less advanced, and all sorts of syntactical and lin- 
guistic helps for the beginner. The editor, Mr. A. W. 
Spanhoofd, shows a keen appreciation of the needs of 
the student, and deserves to have a large following. 
Encouraged by the success of the periodical, the pub- 
lishers have undertaken a similar work for French, and 
we have just received the first issue of " L'Etudiant," 
edited in similar fashion by Dr. Alfred Hennequin. 
Both magazines appear under the auspices of the New 
England College of Languages, with headquarters at 
Boston. 



THE MAID OF ORLEANS.* 

The story is told of the English painter 
Watts, that he replied to a question in regard 
to the figure of the youth trampled under foot 
in his " Mammon " " Why did I paint the 
youth naked ? ' Because he is a type of human- 
ity ; if he had been clothed, and therefore par- 
ticularized, he would have ceased to be a type." 
Much the same sort of observation might be 
made of the " Personal Recollections of Joan 
of Arc." The figure of Jeanne Dare f is so 
clear and distinct, so refined, her life was so 
romantic and yet vouched for as few lives have 
been (hers is the only record of a human life 
the circumstances of which have come to us 
under oath), that it seems a work of superero- 
gation to seek to clothe her with the drapery 
of romance. Since Mr. Clemens has succeeded 
in so cleverly weaving the data of history into 
the narrative he has written, why did he not 
devote himself from the first to writing the life 
of his heroine ? The romantic element in the 
life of the Maid cannot possibly be heightened 
by its use in fiction, nor can it be reduced by the 
strictest adherence to history, for in her life 
history and romance well-nigh coincide. This, 
Mr. Lowell has realized ; and, as a consequence, 
from either point of view he has produced the 
preferable work of the two. 

But what that is new can be said of Jeanne 
Dare? Nothing. Yet while men love that which

1 1 cannot reconcile myself to Mr. Lowell's usage Joan of 
Arc ; nor again to the form Jeanne d'Arc. As to the first, 
a name is too personal a thing to be denationalized, especially 
in the case of so national a character as Jeanne Dare. Mich- 
elet conjectures that she may have been christened with the 
double form Jeanne Jean, according to the French mode of 
giving female names to boys, and vice versa. That observa- 
tion, however, would in no way affect the fact of the name 
Jeanne. In regard to the surname, whether it be d'Arc or 
Dare, I prefer the latter. Even if the name were derived 
from an ancestral village of Arc ( c/'ylrc), the appellation would 
tend to have the force of a distinct surname, as in the case of 
Jeanne's mother, Isabeau Rome'e, the form Rome*e having been 
derived from the circumstance that an early member of the 
family had been distinguished by a pilgrimage to Rome. So 
in the case of Jeanne Dare. This opinion is in deference to 
the authority of M. Valet de Viriville " Nouvelles recherches 
sur la famille de Jeanne Dare," Paris, 1854. A portrait of 
the Maid by an unknown painter, in the Hotel de Ville at 
Rouen, has the form "Jeanne Dare."

is true and beautiful, she will continue to be 
the world's fresh ornament, the largess of whose 
soul made France and the world the richer for 
her having lived in it. 

Jeanne Dare was born January 6, 1412, at 
Domremy near Vaucouleurs. Her father, 
Jacques, was a native of Ceffonds in Cham- 
pagne ; her mother, Isabeau Romee, came from 
Vouthon in the duchy of Bar. Jeanne was 
thus Champenoise through her father and Bar- 
rois through her mother. As to Domremy, it 
was divided by the little brook of Trois-Fon- 
taines, an affluent of the Meuse. The northern 
part of the village was a dependency of the 
Lorraine chatellany of Vaucouleurs ; the south- 
ern part, in which Jeanne was born, belonged 
to the lordship of Gondrecourt, which had held 
of the crown since 1308. Her parents were 
farmer folk of the better class, not rich, but 
possessed of flocks and herds and able to aid 
their poorer neighbors. Jacques Dare enjoyed 
a certain distinction in the village. Jeanne was 
the youngest of five children, three of whom 
were boys. The village was Armagnac in pol- 
itics, and the Armagnac party represented the 
national cause. By 1423 the English had pen- 
etrated into Champagne ; Domremy suffered 
from their incursion at that time. France was 
prostrate before the invader. Her people, not 
yet a nation because not yet out of the toils of 
feudal provincialism, for three generations had 
seen the lilies of France crushed into the dust 
by the foe, and so long as the alliance between 
Burgundy and England lasted the conquest 
would continue. 

But there was promise of morrow even in 
midnight. The Armagnac party, the dominant 
influence at court, was gradually growing to 
be the national party, not for any virtue of its 
own, but because of enmity to that of Burgundy. 
Even negative patriotism was better than no 
national sense. Fortunate was it for France 
that the king was in their hands, for the king, 
were he never so weak, still represented in his 
own person and privileged blood the idea, as 
yet unapprehended, of a native country. He 
reigned by grace of God, by divine right ; loy- 
alty to the king was therefore a Christian duty. 
But loyalty implied patriotism, and this is the 
meaning of the Coming of Jeanne Dare : she 
was the incarnation of French national senti- 
ment. Mr. Lowell has grasped this fact ex- 
cellently well. (Pp. 26, 45, 59, 69, 75.) 

The dominion of the French king in 1429 
embraced only Languedoc, Dauphiny, and the 
Lyonnais. Normandy, Guyenne, and Gascony 



were in English hands ; Artois, Flanders, Picv 
ardy, and Champagne, through Burgundy, were 
at the disposal of the enemy ; while, to crown 
the French humiliation, Paris itself, with the 
immense moral influence implied in its posses- 
sion, was lost to Charles VII. It remained for 
the English to force the barrier of the Loire 
at Orleans, and end the struggle. This was the 
moment chosen for the appearance of the Maid. 
Chosen ? By whom ? Was Jeanne Dare moved 
by a sublime exaltation, or is she to be regarded 
as an interesting pathological study merely?' 
Mr. Lowell has wrought at the problem of her 
character, but guards himself from predeter- 
mining the reader. As for the Sieur Louis de 
Conte, he believes that the influence in her soul 
was of God. 

Consider : the fifteenth century was a period 
of transition, when the old things that had ob- 
tained for centuries were passing away. It was 
an epoch of spiritual, intellectual, economic,, 
and institutional unrest, which already in Italy 
had culminated in the Renaissance, and was- 
destined ere long to combine Renaissance and 
Reformation phenomena together in England,. 
France, and Germany. This was the true pre- 
parative to the Reformation. The great re- 
forming councils ( Pisa, 1409 ; Constance,. 
1414-8 ; Basel, 1431), Wiclif, Huss, the Mys- 
tics, the lay and clerical societies, all showed 
that the Church was not supplying the relig- 
ious needs of the people. Because the apparatus 
of the Church failed, the people sought other 
means. Far from being alienated, however,, 
from the God revealed to them through the 
Church, they were enabled to draw closer to- 
Him. But the Church had not altogether lost its- 
authority, and the combined influence of this 
ancient authority and the new closer relation 
might easily have influenced a sensitive and 
pious soul like that of Jeanne Dare to an undue 
degree. 

Again : what was the character of her early 
education ? Of learning, in the sense of that 
term, she had none. The paternoster and a 
few prayers and litanies had been taught her j 
she could neither read nor write. Her educa- 
tion was that of Elijah. Behind the village of 
Domremy stretched away a vast forest : mighfe 
not those first temples, with their sombre aisles 
thridded here and there by sunbeams as through 
some mullioned window, the shade, the quiet, the 
reverence of the place, have appealed to the ten- 
der child-spirit ? How did her schooling differ, 
save in degree, from that of the prophets of 
old ? Might not the Voice that spake on Car- 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

mel, and caused the Cedars of Lebanon to bow 
themselves, whisper to a maiden, too, in the 
fastness of a forest in the West? After all, 
is not inspiration a question of degree ? Em- 
erson has somewhere said that a man should 
learn to detect and watch the gleam of light 
which flashes across his mind from within, and 
that the virtue of Moses and Plato and Milton 
is that books and traditions were ignored by 
them, while what they thought, because that 
conviction was so intense, was the universal 
sense. Jeanne Dare came to France with the 
impassioned argument of a simple truth. 

And again : consider the place where her 
youth was spent. Domre*my was on the high- 
road between Verdun and Langres, along which 
much of the news of war must have passed. 
Its frontier situation on that debatable land be- 
tween the two combatants would give her unex- 
ampled opportunities. She knew the weariness 
and waste of war ; perchance she had seen the 
king himself ; she felt, at least, the royal hu- 
miliation, not logically, but almost out of in- 
stinct and intuition. But all is not yet ex- 
plained, nor even alluded to, in her character. 
Whence did this child learn wisdom ? As nat- 
ural as the simplest creature of creation, she 
was still supernatural almost superhuman 
in some traits. In the field she astounded the 
grizzled veterans by her conduct, yet she was 
unerring ; in the council chamber this girl of 
seventeen displayed a judgment superior to the 
King's best counsellors. In the trial at Rouen 
her acumen confounded the judges. When 
pressed to reveal what was the mysterious 
" sign " she gave the King, she refused. That 
sign was nothing less than her assurance to 
Charles of his legitimacy, and therefore of his 
legal title to the French crown, a doubt which 
had never crossed the mind of anyone save 
the king himself, and which Jeanne discerned 
either by intuition or revelation. But she knew 
the political importance of the secret][she bore, 
and kept it well. Such capacity was not the 
conduct of a precocious child; her mental 
structure was deeper and more massive than 
that. She was mature without being old ; she 
was experienced without having been tried. 
Moreover, there was nothing hectic about 
Jeanne Dare ; she was spirituelle, but never 
morbid. Bernard of Clairvaux and Francis of 
Assisi starved the flesh that they might nurture 
the spirit ; but Jeanne Dare was abounding in 
physical vitality. The antithesis between her 
and her age, striking as it is, is not more remark- 
able than the combination of ideal motive, nat- 



uralness, and practical shrewdness in her char- 
acter. " You tell us," said William Aymery, 
in the preliminary examination at Poitiers, 
" that God wishes to free the people of France 
from their distress. If He wishes to free them, 
there is no need of the soldiers you ask for." 
" In God's name/' she rejoined, " the men-at- 
arms will fight, and God will give the victory." 
In the assault upon Jargeau, when the Duke 
of Alencon held back, she said to him, " Ah, 
gentle duke, are you afraid ? Do you not know 
that God helps those who help themselves ? " 
Jeanne's keenness and wit, her sense of the 
ridiculous, makes her intensely human. There 
are numerous incidents, known to be true, which 
show this and serve to complicate the prob- 
lem of her character. A friar who believed 
the English report that she was of the devil, 
fell to crossing himself vigorously at sight of 
her, at which she laughed merrily. Believing 
heartily in her mission as one divine, Jeanne 
Dare never pretended to any miraculous power. 
For the Church as an institution she had the 
deepest reverence ; but the hard and worldly 
priest-class of the France of that day she ab- 
horred. " My Lord has a book wherein no clerk 
ever read, were he never so clerkly," was her 
comment upon their pretensions. Her winning 
manner and quiet dignity never failed her un- 
der the most harassing circumstances. At the 
close of a long day's session, when three and 
four inquisitors had exhausted themselves in 
seeking to entangle her, she could say with a 
smile, with upraised hand, as six several ques- 
tions leaped at her from six pairs of lips at 
once, " My good lords, I beg you, one at a 
time." Her keenness at the trial foiled her 
adversaries time and again. Urged to give de- 
tails regarding the character of the vision that 
pointed out the king to her at Chinon, she sug- 
gested that they might send to the king, from 
whom doubtless they could get answer. When 
asked if she knew she was in the grace of God, 
she replied, " May God bring me into his grace 
if I am not in it ; if I am in it, may He keep 
me there." Even the examiners were filled 
with admiration at the answer, for the question 
was a dilemma : if the answer were yes, it 
could be construed into unholy presumption j 
if the answer were no, it was a confession of 
guilt. Her retaliation to this double-edged 
query came, when, in reply to the question 
whether St. Michael, who appeared to her, were 
clothed or not, she turned it by asking, " Do 
you not think that God, who taketh care of the 
lilies of the field and clotheth the fowls of the

air, has not the wherewithal to care for his 
saints ? " 

The lips of history are not dumb like the 
stone lips of the sphinx, but there is a riddle 
in the life of Jeanne Dare not yet divulged ; 
the facts of her life are like letters scattered 
upon the ground the message is and is not. 
" I believe that she was led by the spirit of 
God, and that there was in her a virtue divine 
and not human," was the comment of a lawyer 
who had seen her at Orleans ; and human in- 
genuity has not added anything essential to, 
or taken anything essential from, this verdict 
from that day to this. After four hundred 
years, in spite of the attentive study of schol- 
ars, the inquiry of science, the devotion of ad- 
mirers all of whom have conspired to erect 
into a cult the study of the life and character 
of Jeanne Dare, in spite of everything, all 
explanations are tentative and imperfect, and 
themselves require explanation. 

But to return to Orleans upon the Loire, 
the uttermost outpost of France against the 
English, whither Jeanne bent her steps after 
she had received the king's support. Orleans 
was a city of perhaps twenty thousand people, 
who lived in a strongly fortified territorial cir- 
cumscription of about one hundred acres in 
extent.* The French army, when its new leader 
appeared, was demoralized, an insensate rab- 
ble without order, deficient in respect for au- 
thority, lawless, brawling, licentious, and cruel. 
LaHire's notorious witticism "If God should 
turn man-at-arms, He would be a cut-throat " 
accurately illustrates the moral situation. 
The coming of the Maid changed the spirit of 
the army. LaHire himself ceased to swear by 
anything greater than his baton. The morale 
of the army, under the fire of her enthusiasm, 
was refined and purged of its dross. Its cour- 
age rose in degree. " Before she came," wrote 
a French chronicler, "two hundred English- 
men used to chase five hundred Frenchmen ; 
after her coming two hundred Frenchmen used 
to chase four hundred English." Jeanne's 
theory of the art of war was plain : to hit hard 
and often, a practice at variance with the 
desultory military methods of the time, when 
weeks were occupied in a languid siege. Or- 
leans was saved ; the campaign of the Loire 
was followed by the coronation of Charles VII., 
who had hitherto been, and that for eight years, 
only dauphin. Yet the mission of Jeanne Dare 

* The proportion between population and area presented in 
these figures indicates that overcrowding was a problem of 
urban life in the Middle Ages as to-day. 



was not over. The real end of her mission was 
the deliverance of France ; Orleans and Rheims 
were means to that end. But the 23d of May, 
1430 that month charged with so much 
fatality for her * witnessed her capture before 
Compiegne and her surrender to the English. 
The monarchy, under control of the infamous 
La Tremoille, stirred not a finger in her be- 
half. Charles was apathetic. Even the people, 
save in remote corners of France, were for the 
most part alienated or indifferent, for when 
circumstances for which Jeanne was in no way 
responsible defeated her purposes, they wagged 
their heads in superstitious ignorance, think- 
ing God had forsaken her. " From the time 
of her capture to her death," these are Mr. 
Lowell's melancholy words, "there came to 
Joan from the king she had crowned, from the 
council whose orders she had obeyed, and from 
the captains with whom she had served, not a 
word or a sign. Except for a few of her ene- 
mies who came at last to pity her, she was left 
alone. She lived and died as if king and court 
and soldiers and the French nation had ceased 
to exist" (p. 234). She had to sanctify her 
mission with the incense of martyrdom ere 
awakened France realized that the peasant girl 
of Domremy was the trumpet of a prophecy. 

The process by which Jeanne was tried was 
that of the Inquisition. It had to be so, for, 
by the laws of war as they then prevailed, a 
prisoner was the possession of her captor, who 
could put her to ransom if he pleased. Having 
purchased her for ten thousand pounds, the 
English government could not put her to death 
in cold blood, for the logic of the situation re- 
quired that it be willing, too, to accept a ran- 
som for her, if proffered. That none came, 
surprised the English. But some pretext had 
to be found to render control over her complete, 
even unto death. The Church afforded that 
recourse. Where the civil authority could not 
reach, that of the Church could. The guilt of 
heresy was the only means whereby the death 
penalty could be inflicted according to legal 
process. It required, however, all the learn- 
ing that could be mustered by doctors bred to 
the bar, by professors from the University of 
Paris, and by priestcraft, to compass the life of 
Jeanne Dare. We have to thank Mr. Lowell 
for a very lucid account of the law and the pro- 
cedure (pp. 259-60). Hour after hour, day 
after day, through the long and tedious trial,

the intrepid girl foiled her enemies by the per- 
fect candor of her speech, or disarmed them by 
the shrewdness of her retort. But she was be- 
tween hammer and anvil, and could not escape, 
though it required the last device of the exam- 
iners to incriminate her. 

" Joan had asserted that she was God's messenger, 
commissioned by Him through the voice of the saints 
and angels. It was possible, to say the least, that her 
inspiration was from the Devil. Was she willing to 
leave the question to the Church ? If she refused sub- 
mission, her guilt was established, for to deny the au- 
thority of the Church was at once the commonest arid 
the deadliest of heresies. If she submitted, then the 
ecclesiastical tribunal before which she stood was ready 
to assume the functions of the Church, and to decide 
the question against her " (Lowell, p. 293). 

But conviction alone would not satisfy her im- 
placable foes. If she died unrepentant, the 
French might still believe in her, and that she 
had been put to death unjustly. Torture was 
evidently the only means which could break the 
spirit of the girl who had triumphantly stood 
out against those trained advocates. Weary, 
deserted, heartsick, homesick, in pain of body 
and in mental anguish, weakened by a year's 
imprisonment under brutal jailers and the 
strain of the trial during the fast of Lent which 
she had faithfully kept, the sensitive girl 
for with all her divine qualities she was yet a 
woman shrank from the white-hot brazier 
that with hellish ingenuity was shown to her 
with threats whose meaning could not be mis- 
taken. For a moment the spirit wavered ; the 
strain was more than nature could endure ; the 
flesh cried out for relief she recanted.* Surely 
if Another, who was very God as well as very 
man, could cry for relief, then a relapse so soon 
recovered from and atoned for by the fires of 
martyrdom may be forgiven Jeanne Dare. Her 
retraction was of the lips and the hand, not 
of the heart ; in the quiet of the cell to which 
she had been returned her brave heart rallied 
for the supreme test. " Whatever I said was 
said from fear of fire," she cried. But the fire 
was not to be at once, though it was certain. 
The Inquisition now strained its last cord in 
order to send her to the stake confessing the 
justice of her punishment ! For months Jeanne 
had been denied the Eucharist ; her pious soul 
shrank to enter the grave unattended by its 
holy influence. But the Eucharist could only 
be administered to a contrite penitent ; if, there- 
fore, she partook of it, it would seem the con- 

* The nature and extent of this abjuration is a matter of 
question. It is probable that she was unaware of the exact 
character of the document she signed. Her after-statements 
indicate that she had no intention of retreating from her essen- 
tial position (Cf. Lowell, C. 23). 



fession of the sin whereof she stood accused. 
But her soul, as white as heaven, did not flinch 
before the teachings of those scribes and Phar- 
isees. 

The end was come. On May 30, 1431, in 
the market-square of Rouen, the courageous 
spirit was released ; she was given to the fire, 
" from whose arms the winds," as was finely 
said of Shelley, " took her and shook her broad- 
cast to the world." Like Shelley, too, her heart 
remained unconsumed. Her mission did not 
die with her. The ashes of that hearth in 
Rouen could not be extinguished, and quick- 
ened to life the feelings of the French nation.* 
Out of France with the English ! 

Has the reader followed so far, to come only 
to the threshold of these works ? Not so. Mr. 
Lowell's book, in what has been written, is 
behind us. It is serious, sober-suited history, 
conscientiously wrought out with fullest refer- 
ence to sources and authorities. The grandeur 
of the theme would make the book one of ab- 
sorbing interest apart from the grace of the 
writer. Mrs. Oliphant's " Jeanne d'Arc " (the 
reader will please forgive the three several 
forms of spelling her name) is rather a literary 
history. It is a gracefully written and sym- 
pathetic biography of the Maid. It will afford 
interesting reading for those who are fond of 
knowing results rather than processes, but the 
profit will be slight compared to that to be de- 
rived from reading Mr. Lowell. Of the " Rec- 
ollections of the Sieur Louis de Conte " so 
much cannot be said. As intimated, it cannot 
claim that protection too often afforded the 
"historical" novel, for it has not the novel 
form it is without plot, while the pretension 
to be history makes it amenable to the criti- 
cisms to which historical writing must always 
be subjected. To be plain, Mark Twain, like 
Tennyson in " The Princess," has made a gor- 
geous failure. The theme was too perfect to 
be marred by recourse to fiction. Moreover, 
by adopting the method he has, he has been 
forced to commit himself in places in which 
the cautious historian would hold judgment in 
abeyance. This was inevitable, for the " Recol- 
lections " are supposed to be the spontaneous 
outpouring of a heart devoted to her cause. 
But there are evidences that this spontaneity 
has been labored. The style is artificial, pre- 
senting an incongruous combination of archaic 
forms and present-day usages often in imme- 
diate juxtaposition. The actors move like fig-

ures in a panorama ; their language is neither 
wholly mediaeval nor wholly modern, and the 
thought that is swayed in it is a curious blend- 
ing of mediaeval concepts and modern ideas. 
Jeanne at times moralizes like a philosopher, 
as witness this nice bit of casuistry in a peas- 
ant lass : 

" The Sieur Bertrand was amused at Joan's naive 
way of referring to her advice as if it had been a val- 
uable present to a hostile leader who was saved by it 
from making a censurable blunder of omission, and then 
he went on to admire how ingeniously she had deceived 
that man and yet had not told him anything that was 
not the truth. This troubled Joan, and she said: 

" ' I thought he was deceiving himself. I f orebore 
to tell him lies, for that would have been wrong; but if 
my truths deceived him, perhaps that made them lies.' 

" She was assured that she had done right, and that 
in the perils and necessities of war deceptions that help 
one's own cause and hurt the enemy's were always per- 
missible. . . . Jean (her brother) said: 

" Joan, you told us yourself that you were going to 
Uncle Laxart's to nurse his wife, but you did n't say you 
were going further, yet you did go on to Vaucoleurs. 
There!' 

" ' I see now,' said Joan, sorrowfully, ' I told no lie, 
yet I deceived. . . . But the thing itself was right, and 
I would do it again! ' It seemed an over-nice distinc- 
tion, but nobody said anything " (pp. 92-3). 

The Sieur de Conte, too, attempts the phil- 
osophy of history, in a simple narrative, and 
that of the fifteenth century : 

*' Joan was France, the spirit of France made flesh. 
That was a humble eye to see so great a truth where 
others failed. . . . And yet, after all, it was just what 
such natures do. When they love a great and noble 
thing, they embody it they want it so that they can 
see it with their eyes ; like Liberty, for instance (Verily, 
the French Revolution in 1492). They are not content 
with the cloudy abstract idea" (p. 174). 

This edifying commentary upon the corona- 
tion might be a page from a history of 1789 : 

" Of all the wise people in high office in France, only 
one knew the priceless worth of this neglected prize. . . . 
How did she know it ? It is simple : she was a peasant. 
That tells the whole story. She was of the people and 
knew the people ; those others moved in a loftier sphere 
and knew nothing much about them. We make little 
account of that vague, formless, inert mass, that mighty 
underlying force which we call ' the people ' an epi- 
thet which carries contempt with it. It is a strange 
attitude; for at bottom we know that the throne which 
the people support stands, and that when that support 
is removed, nothing in the world can save it." 

How many popular revolutions can Mark 
Twain point out in the Middle Ages ? For a 
monarchy built up, not on popular right, but 
on privilege, flanked by princes and barons 
instead of " the people," the French monarchy 
was a pretty stable affair, since it lasted from 
987 to 1789. 

Page 89 presents us with so absurd a situation 



that, remembering Mark Twain's former writ- 
ings, one laughs at once. Jeanne, while leading 
her little band through the forest at night, in 
the darkness stumbles upon some English sol- 
diers. A colloquy ensues between the English 
commander and Jeanne, who has been mis- 
taken for an English trooper ; and Jeanne, 
whose knowledge of the French language was 
not larger than the dialect of Lorraine, calmly 
holds converse in English (!) without betray- 
ing her identity. There are other evidences 
that the Sieur Louis de Conte must have 
experienced re - incarnation in 1835. Such 
phrases as " Tours was a humming town "; " he 
went on pouring out a most pathetic stream, 
. . . which broke Joan all up" are unmistak- 
able American parlance. Criticism may not 
conclude here. As Jeanne's page and secre- 
tary professes to be writing history, and espe- 
cially since the "translator" gives an extended 
list of authorities " examined in verification of 
the truth of this narrative," that history must 
be judged by the dicta of historical literature. 
The prophecy that a virgin would save France 
from her enemies is attributed (p. 72) to Mer- 
lin. The actual belief which prevailed in the 
reign of Charles VII. was that foretold by 
Mary of Avignon to Charles VI. The Battle 
of the Herrings was fought upon February 12, 
1429, and not two days later (p. 75). More- 
over, there is next to no proof that Jeanne 
prophesied this event that is a fabrication of 
later days, an observation which the " trans- 
lator " should have made in a warning note. 
At Chinon, " several weeks " (p. 107) did not 
elapse, but only a few days, before Jeanne saw 
Charles ; and the commission to inquire into her 
early life was not sent into Lorraine until the 
investigation instituted at Poitiers. Jeanne's 
premonitions of capture did not come a full 
year (p. 216) before her taking at Compicgue. 
Our knowledge of this fact is based on her own 
testimony ; the time between prophecy and ful- 
filment was not over two months. But the 
greatest blunder is made when the honor of 
selecting Richemont for constable of France is 
ascribed to her (pp. 259-60). 

Mr. Lowell, too, has not wholly escaped er- 
rors, but they are of minor importance and 
concern Jeanne Dare in no particular save 
once. The exception has reference to her cap- 
ture. It is probable M. Cosneau says " peut- 
etre" that La Tremoille, the evil genius of 
Charles, was instrumental in betraying her; 
yet, strangely enough, Mr. Lowell makes no 
allusion to it. Aside from this important mat-

ter, criticism is limited. E. g., Orleans is not 
in Touraine (p. 52) ; the University of Caen 
was established by the regent Bedford, and not 
after the English lost Paris in 1436. The 
most obvious error, however, is the statement 
that " an enormous body of the French nobility 
stumbled helplessly against the well-disciplined 
English troops at Agincourt " (p. 5). The 
truth of this battle is the exact reverse : the 
French wanted to fight, and the English could 
not avoid engagement.

MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EVOLUTION 
AT ANPOVER.* 

Professor Harris, of Andover Theological 
Seminary, has given us, in his work on " Moral 
Evolution," a noble and notable contribution 
to the religious thought and life of America. 
The scope is comprehensive, embracing the 
essential principles and intimate relations of 
science, ethics, and religion. The spirit is pre- 
eminently sane and catholic. Nothing crude 
or narrow or intemperate disfigures these pages. 
There is great clearness of thought, without 
dogmatism ; deep earnestness, but freedom 
from intolerance ; a glad acceptance of science, 
and yet no surrender of the commanding truths 
of religion. The widest hospitality toward the 
revelation now unfolding is linked with an his- 
torical appreciation that makes us always rev- 
erent of the past, though not slaves to its wor- 
thies. An abundant learning shines through, 
but does not encumber, these discussions of 
vast themes. The author has evidently read 
widely and meditated at length upon the varied 
topics which he treats ; but instead of asking 
us to travel with him along all those weary and 
winding paths, he gives us, in short, clear, sug- 
gestive sentences, the discovery which he made 
by the way or the conclusion which he reached 
at the end. The literary method of the work is 
as satisfactory as its general temper. A fluent 
stream of discourse bears us onward through 
a varied landscape, always distinctly seen, and 
constantly opening into fresh views of truth and 
duty, both instructive and interesting. 

No attempt is here made to reconcile science 
and religion after the manner of the crude car- 
pentry of a quarter of a century ago ; and still, 
throughout these chapters, these realms lie be- 
fore us, not as rival, nor even as separate king-

doms, but as different phases of divine verities. 
Professor Harris fearlessly carries the scientific 
method over into the region of piety, assuming 
that reverence will build an altar wherever the 
torch of discovery lights up the universe. He 
boldly appropriates for the service of religion 
every new truth that the scientist reveals, claim- 
ing that the more we really know the prof ounder 
must be our worship and the ampler our phil- 
anthropy. And everywhere he brings out the 
ethical import of facts and insists upon a more 
ethical ministry of the church, holding that 
knowledge must be made fruitful in human 
worth and that theology must make the moral 
law central. 

We have, therefore, a discussion that is com- 
pletely emancipated from the old apologetic 
tone, and yet it is a treatment of a great sub- 
ject that makes powerfully for a noble recon- 
ciliation, leaving both thought and worship free. 
While the teaching is lifted far above the petty 
preachments of small moralists, every sentence 
glows with an ethical passion which commu- 
nicates to the reader the enthusiasm of human- 
ity. And though cast in a mould very different 
from that of dogmatic theology, this is never- 
theless a discourse upon God, which leads us 
to find his presence in all facts, and to trace 
his ways, with the glow of wonder and worship, 
through all the manifold affairs of humanity. 
Withal, it is a plea for a religion that shall be 
rational and humane ; for a theology that shall 
be ethical and practical ; for an application of 
science that shall fruit in philanthropic service ; 
and for an interpretation of our ethical life 
that shall make it the human expression, 
through the method of evolution, of what is es- 
sential in Universal Being. 

After some brief but pertinent remarks re- 
specting the misuse of the term " Evolution," 
Professor Harris traces the various bearings 
upon the problem of ethics of the great mod- 
ern discovery which this word represents. He 
criticises both Professor Huxley and Mr. Kidd, 
holding, against the former, that the ethical 
law and life are included within the cosmical 
process ; and against the latter, that our spir- 
itual life is essentially rational. Ethics and 
evolution, he claims, are neither identical nor 
antagonistic, but moral sentiment unfolds in 
harmony with the general evolution of the cos- 
mos, and ethical principles come to expression 
in humanity through a process of evolution 
which is an essential part of the unfolding of 
the universe. 

The individual plays a large part in this eth- 



358 



[June 16, 



ical process ; and just because of this fact 
(which recent writers have been inclined to 
overlook), "self-realization" is as divine an 
obligation as " altruism." Here we have a 
needed corrective of what is unwise in ex- 
treme phases of socialism. While " sympathy " 
makes the community possible, " self-love " is 
just as necessary to build up individuals with- 
out whom there can be no prosperous or pro- 
gressive community. It is here that Professor 
Harris makes his most original and valuable 
contribution to the discussion of ethics. He 
contends : " The truth is that self-realization is 
as moral as altruism " (p. 133). His survey 
and criticism of different ethical theories is 
interesting though brief, but his emphasis upon 
" self - realization " brings into prominence a 
somewhat neglected phase of moral truth ; and 
though he will probably meet with opposition 
at this point, there is so much of practical wis- 
dom in his words, and the spirit playing through 
them is so sober and thoughtful, that it is well 
worth while to have this forcible and suggestive 
presentation. 

Following this discussion of the rootage and 
character of ethical principles in general, Pro- 
fessor Harris devotes the next seven chapters 
(VIII.-XIV.) to an application of these truths 
to religion. And this complicated subject he 
treats in a broad and forward-looking spirit. 
He brings religion and morality into close as- 
sociation, tracing the reactions of each upon 
the other. Religion flows into morality as in- 
spiration and motive power, while morality be- 
comes the test and fruitage of religion. The 
thought of God is given in our experience of 
nature : " That which is intelligible has intel- 
ligence in it" (p. 185). The love of God as 
the " Good " springs from our experience with 
human nature : " The moral order, as observed 
in history, is a divine order " (p. 191). The 
Christian ideal is described, both as a personal 
estate and as a social order, a plea being made 
for the use of the term " Christian Ethics " 
(following Dorner and also Smyth), which 
seems far from wise, while a protest is made 
against overworking the idea of " the kingdom 
of heaven," which, though an inspiring phrase, 
is not an exhaustive description of Christianity. 

The chapter on "Degeneration," not very 
germane, and certainly inadequate as an exam- 
ination of the problem of moral evil, is followed 
by a longer discussion of the regeneration of 
the individual and of society. It is graciously 
admitted that regeneration is a process far 
wider than Christendom, while this process is 



defined with no reference to that supernatural- 
ism by which theologians so long obscured a 
spiritual awakening native to man as a man. 
Some conservative observations are devoted to 
economic methods and agencies, with a plea 
that the ethical element be more largely recog- 
nized, both in theory and practice. Judicious 
but brief remarks are made upon the Family, 
Democracy, and the Public Schools, especially 
as they contribute to that moral evolution which 
works itself out as personal and social regen- 
eration. While insisting upon the necessarily 
secular but not irreligious character of the com- 
mon school, the very obvious but often neglected 
truth is stated : " It is inconsistent with our 
principles for the state to assume religious 
functions " (p. 388). 

The last two chapters of the book are occu- 
pied with a discussion of the modifications in 
theology made inevitable by the new views re- 
specting both ethics and evolution. A few quo- 
tations very significant when we consider that 
they emanate from a professor in Andover 
Theological Seminary indicate how Professor 
Harris interprets the trend and quality of mod- 
ern religious thought. It is very truly said : 
" The centre of doctrine has been shifting from 
sovereignty to fatherhood. It is believed that 
power is directed by reason, and reason by love " 
(p. 401). Revelation is described very broadly : 

" Revelation and evolution are two sides of one and 
the same reality. ... It is a mistaken view of revela- 
tion which sees in it only intervention; only an excep- 
tional and disconnected breaking in upon orderly move- 
ment. . . . Revelation is not by occasional stroke, but 
by a continuous process. It is not superimposed, but in- 
herent. . . . All realities, then, are revelations. Nature, 
humanity, and genius, which is the epitome of human- 
ity, are embodiments of divine truth, goodness, and 
beauty" (pp. 411, 414, 415). 

In setting forth the claim that Christianity is 
preeminently an ethical religion, whose gospel 
as proclaimed by Jesus himself made personal 
righteousness central, this condemnation is 
passed upon teachings still all too popular : 
" Some evangelistic and revivalistic preaching 
in effect represents salvation as independent 
of character " (p. 397). The old traditional 
theory of the atonement is criticised in these 
words : 

" Until recently the usual representations of atone- 
ment were justly open to the charge of immorality. 
Even now, such representations continue to be made to 
a considerable degree. The moral sense is shocked at 
some of the reasons given for atonement. The impu- 
tation of our sins to Christ has been so stated that it 
seemed as if all regard for righteousness had been over- 
looked. The penal suffering of Christ was regarded as 
the philosophy of atonement. It was believed that God

359 



laid on Christ the penalty of our sins, or a suffering 
equivalent to that penalty. . . . This disappearing 
theory fails to satisfy because it is immoral, because it 
places salvation somewhere else than in character, be- 
cause it converts the sympathy and love of Christ into 
legal fictions, because it places the ethical demands of 
justice above the ethical necessities of love" (p. 407). 

It is strongly urged that the old interpretation 
of providence, which consigned millions to per- 
dition, is immoral : 

" Still another immoral conception of God is that 
which represents him as leaving vast multitudes of his 
children to perish or to sink into hopeless perdition with- 
out giving them the truth which can save them. . . . 
The moral sense revolts from such an idea. Few preach- 
ers and theologians can now be found who believe that 
the masses of heathendom are eternally lost. From the 
logic of the premise that the earthly life is decisive of 
the destiny of all men, escape is sought in various ways; 
as, that all souls have the essential Christ, that multi- 
tudes of heathen are renewed in character before death 
and only need the sunlight of Christ's presence to de- 
velop those seeds of holy character which have already 
begun to germinate. These lame devices show that the 
conception of God is changing " (p. 402). 

To the present reviewer, the least satisfac- 
tory part of this most hopeful and interesting 
volume is that devoted to the person of Jesus. 
There is everywhere most admirable candor 
and absolute freedom from dogmatism. It is 
delightful to read an author who, besides being 
just to opponents, is still a seeker for truth, 
and holds his views subject to revision. He 
readily admits that many beliefs about Jesus, 
once asserted as necessary to salvation, are 
no part of essential Christianity. Professor 
Harris does indeed bring Jesus a long way out 
of the mists of tradition into the light of his- 
tory. A vast amount of supernaturalism is 
stripped off by this short sentence : " The power 
of Jesus resides in his own character of good- 
ness" (p. 304). The limitation of Jesus is 
freely admitted : " In knowledge he was not om- 
niscient. He gained information as other men 
did. He shared the opinions of his time as to 
the universe, and in other essential respects was 
truly human. He had wonderful insight, but 
did not have omniscience " (p. 404). It is 
noted with gladness that recently a radical 
change has occurred in the world's thought of 
Jesus : " The change has amounted to a recov- 
ery of his humanity " (p. 403). This change 
is welcomed as a step forward : " He is be- 
lieved in as a human incarnation and revela- 
tion of the God of holy love. This is a marked 
instance of the moral evolution of theology " 
(p. 404). The miracles in general are looked 
upon with some uncertainty, and are considered 
at best as " secondary in importance." The 



belief in the resurrection is admitted to be at- 
tended with grave difficulties ; while the virgin 
birth, though not denied, is not regarded as an 
essential doctrine of Christianity. Here is pro- 
gress indeed, but not that clearness of vision 
that would result from a frank acceptance of 
the existence of legendary elements in the Gos- 
pels, which is the position of the best Biblical 
scholarship of the day.

THE HELLENISTIC EMPIRE ix EGYPT.* 

Mr. Mahaffy's very able work on " The Em- 
pire of the Ptolemies " will be warmly wel- 
comed by every student of that great and 
fascinating Hellenistic world, created by the 
conquests of Alexander, which brought into 
their most intimate contact the civilizations of 
Asia and the Nile valley on the one hand, and 
of Europe on the other. For the first time in 
the world's history, continental and race dis- 
tinctions are at this period effectually broken 
up ; the student feels that he is surveying the 
combined history of the Mediterranean coun- 
tries and their neighbors, irrespective of geo- 
graphical lines or linguistic affinities. For the 
student of that Europe which finally emerged 
from this great inter-continental commingling, 
it is of vital importance to understand fully the 
complicated contact by which so much of ori- 
ental civilization was absorbed into western cul- 
ture. Nowhere in the Mediterranean basin can 
this phase of the Hellenistic period be studied 
so favorably as at Alexandria. Here the in- 
tense religious feeling of the orient, the highest 
level of Eastern achievement in industries, art, 
and architecture, in politics, typical oriental 
despotism, the best learning of the East in law, 
science, and religion, including that of the Jews, 
in fine, all the elements of the incalculably 
ancient civilization of the East, are found side 
by side and in daily contact with the complex 
life of cultivated Europe. The Nile valley has 
preserved to us documentary and monumental 
remains of all this, as they have never been 
elsewhere preserved. 

The results of a study of these survivals are 
for the most part to be found only in learned 
and bulky treatises, quite inaccessible to the 
ordinary reader. Mr. Mahaffy has therefore 
done great service in furnishing a scholarly and 
at the same time very readable account of the 



*THB EMPIRE OF THE PTOLEMIES. By J. P. Mahaffy.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Ptolemaic or Hellenistic domination in Egypt. 
Besides his eminent fitness for the task as a 
scholar, Mr. Mahaffy has enjoyed unusual priv- 
ileges in the study of the most recently discov- 
ered Greek papyri, which have often come di- 
rectly into his hands from the spade of the 
excavator in Egypt, as, for example, those 
unearthed by Mr. Petrie. These papyri are 
of the greatest interest, and afford us glimpses 
of the life of the people such as are rarely to 
be found in the writings of the Greek or Roman 
historians. Sometimes it is a bill, again a 
deed, now a receipt, or it may be the court rec- 
ord of a lawsuit ; but out of it all we are grad- 
ually gaining a picture of the life of the com- 
mon people in the Egypt of a few centuries 
before and after Christ. 

The history of the Ptolemies is perhaps the 
most difficult to unravel in all the Grseco- 
Koman world. It swarms with unsolved prob- 
lems ; and often, at the most interesting junc- 
ture, the paucity of materials, or their complete 
failure, preclude any safe conclusion. More- 
over, it is a new field. As Mr. Mahaffy says 
in his preface : " The writer on Ptolemaic 
history feels himself in some sort a pioneer, 
who is liable to be baulked by unexpected ob- 
stacles, misled by ardent expectations, diverted 
from his path by. false informations. Yet are 
all these risks and dangers unable to outweigh 
the intense interest of penetrating a country 
either unexplored or imperfectly described by 
former travellers." It must be said that the 
author has shown notable skill in meeting the 
unusual difficulties of his task. Of course, he 
owes much to his German predecessors in the 
same field ; but it is evident that he is quite 
master of his material, and capable of independ- 
ent judgment, even when he follows his Ger- 
man authorities rather closely. In one notable 
respect he is much superior to the Germans, 
and that is in the charming style which he 
commands. His history never degenerates into 
an arid chronicle. This is due to the nature 
of the man, but also to the fact that wherever 
his classic sources flow scantily he is able to fill 
out a meagre chronicle of political events with 
a vivid picture of the life of the times, taken 
from the welcome Greek papyri with which he 
is enviably familiar. 

The work is so largely concerned with in- 
volved detail, with complex political and gov- 
ernmental problems, that it is impossible to 
offer any epitome of the ground covered. A 
few points where the author's conclusion may 
be open to question should, however, be noted. 



In writing on the first Ptolemy, Mr. Mahaffy 
uses Brugsch's translation, made twenty-five 
years ago, of the well-known hieroglyphic in- 
scription dating from the seventh year of the 
young Alexander. This translation is obsolete 
and very inaccurate. Its inaccuracy has affected 
the author's conclusion on a very important 
point. He is inclined to think that it was as late 
as 305 B. C. before Ptolemy I. "formally called 
himself king" (p. 58); but in the second line 
of the above inscription Ptolemy is referred to 
as " king " (Coptic owro), which Brugsch has 
given its older meaning, " great satrap," no 
longer conceivable at this late date. Moreover, 
in line eight of the inscription (and in other 
places) Ptolemy is referred to as " his majesty." 
Now this is at least five years earlier than 305 
B. C. However, the bulk of the material is in 
Greek, and it is not often that the author is 
obliged to take his translations at second hand. 
In the main, he has handled his purely Egyp- 
tian sources very well. " Chem " (p. 70) is a 
mistake from Murray's guide-book, and is given 
correctly " Chnum " on p. 489. "Hatasu " (pp. 
128-9 and 387) is apparently an error so 
deeply rooted that it will take another genera- 
tion to correct it. On p. 387 we have " Dayr- 
el-Medineh," but on p. 272 it was " Deyr." 
We do not understand the reference to Alex- 
andria (p. 77) as being a hundred miles dis- 
tant from the Fayum. Even the shortest air- 
line across the desert is one hundred and twenty 
miles. 

The author's conjecture (p. 273), in opposi- 
tion to Diodorus, that the Nubian king Er- 
gameiies was contemporary with Ptolemy IV., 
finds brilliant confirmation in the recent exca- 
vations at Philae. Herr Borchardt writes me 
from the first cataract, that they have discov- 
ered, on Philae, a temple in which the name of 
the Nubian Ergamenes occurs together with 
that of the fourth Ptolemy. 

On the whole, the author shows an evident 
inclination to idealise the Ptolemies, a tendency 
in which he is distinctly at variance with the 
Germans. Undue weight seems to be given to 
any indication of noble qualities in any mem- 
ber of the family. Nevertheless, this is one of 
the charms of the book, and undoubtedly the 
most readable passages in the treatise are those 
in which the fair side of the picture is presented. 
Especially admirable are the accounts of the 
institutions of Alexandria founded and main- 
tained by the Ptolemies for the cultivation of 
Greek literature and learning. Although so 
much remains to be done in this field, although

much is discovered every year, nevertheless Mr. 
Mahaffy's book will long remain the standard 
work upon the Ptolemaic period for the scholar 
or the man of letters, and will be permanently 
useful even to the specialist. Its usefulness is 
much enhanced by a full chronological table 
and a complete index. The classical scholar 
will welcome the Greek text of the Decree of 
Canopus and the stone of Eosette, with critical 
notes. The typographical work is excellent, 
and externally the book shows the best of work- 
manship. JAMES HENRY BREASTED. 



BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS.* 

Voltaire made a most unfortunate observation 
when he said that rare books are worth nothing, since 
if they are worth anything they would not be rare. 
We know better nowadays ; or, at least, we may 
easily learn better if we will read some of the nu- 
merous books lately issued dealing with the facts or 
the philosophy of rarity in books. At the outset, 
we must be brave enough to ignore Voltaire's im- 
plied reproach of those who seek a book for other 
reasons than its literary or human interest, and must 
admit without shame that we do care for the so-called 
" externals " of a book the binding, style, date, 
and the story of its individual existence. If we can- 
not enter into sympathy with Charles Lamb, and 
his exquisite story of the book which he so coveted 
that for its sake the old brown suit was made to 
hang on six weeks longer ; if we cannot understand 
why it is that it is never the ninety and nine treatises 
which a bibliomaniac has, but the hundredth which 
he has not, that entrances his mind and fires his 
ambition, filling him with the opium-eater's bliss 
without the opium-eater's bale then the gates of 
ex-libris land are probably barred against us for- 
ever. But if we do kindle at the thought of a " first 
edition," if we do seek to know something of the 
principles of this noble industry and royal sport of 
book-hunting, which is as old as literature itself, the 
means of knowing are at hand. 

The novice, one who has not mastered so much as 
the technical phrases and terminology, will find just 
the authority the primer of the subject in Mr. 
Brander Mattbews's recent work on " Bookbindings 
Old and New." There he will learn the meaning 
and see tbe illustration of what are called, in book-

binder's parlance, " tools," " powders," " fanfares," 
etc.; will be initiated into the technique of the biblio- 
pegic craft in its two stages of " forwarding " and 
" finishing "; will get a glimpse at the sequence of 
styles in different countries and at different dates, 
and at the characteristics which mark them as " Al- 
dine," " Grolier," Henry II.," Padeloup," " De- 
rome," " Cobden- Sanderson," or by other names 
with which later study continually will bring him in 
contact ; will be shown the causes why bookbinding 
in the nineteenth century, while improving as a 
handicraft, has declined as an art, and in America 
has been retarded by causes outside of art. 

The great beauty of all the early bindings is in 
the lavish and tasteful ornamentation of the sides. 
In the early days of printing, and when the tradi- 
tions of manuscripts still were dominant, the shelves 
of a library inclined like a reading-desk, and the 
handsome volumes lay on their sides, taking their 
ease. Instead of being packed together on level 
shelves with only the backs visible, each stately tome 
stood forth singly, and the broad sides of the ample 
folios seemed to invite decoration. 

The chapters dealing with " extra binding " the 
covering of a single volume in accord with the fancy 
of the owner of that one book occupy about half of 
Mr. Matthews's work, and are followed by equally 
lucid and profitable chapters on the more prosaic 
subjects of " Commercial Bookbinding," " Books in 
Paper Covers," and "The Grolier Club in New 
York." The story of this New York club, named 
after a book-lover and collector who was born before 
this continent was discovered, is one of great interest. 
Its constitution declares that " its object shall be the 
literary study and promotion of the arts pertaining 
to the production of books." That is to say, the 
Grolier Club is interested in books, not as literature, 
but as works of art. Although many of its mem- 
bers are scholars and students of literature, it is 
with the art and mystery of the book-maker, the 
printer, the engraver, and the binder, and not with 
the secrets of authorship, that they concern them- 
selves ; as a result the Grolier Club has established 
a standard of formal excellence in bibliography 
higher and more exacting than any now existing in 
Europe. The reader will be specially grateful for 
the magnificence and abundance of the illustrations, 
presenting, as they do, examples of every form of 
the art from its earliest beginnings to the paper 
covers of the latest American magazine. 

As an equipment in the principles which govern 
the practice of book-buying, one may be referred to 
an essay on " The Philosophy of Rarity," by Mr. 
G. H. Powell the first and longest of the essays 
composing the volume called " Excursions in Libra- 
ria." The ''philosophy" here expounded is the 
craft and " venerie " of the book-hunter. It distin- 
guishes between different classes of books of which 
" some are born rare, some achieve rarity, and some 
have rarity thrust upon them." 

Volumes of, so to speak, native rarity are those 
printed in relatively remote places, in small quan- 



362 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



titles (either owing to the expense of production or 
peculiarity of the subject, or merely for the sake of 
the consequent rarity), or at private presses. The 
collector who values books according to the locality 
of their origin will do well to have at his fingers' 
ends the various dates at which printing was intro- 
duced into the different capitals and countries of the 
world, the degrees by which Italy, France, the 
Netherlands, Spain, and England fall behind Ger- 
many, the more distant countries, the East and 
America, coming of course later still ; for all these, 
the standard of rarity on account of place and date 
has to be shifted proportionately. Of the books 
which, though produced in plenty, have been reduced 
to rarity by recent demand, notable examples are 
the first editions of modern romances, which of late 
years have formed the chief big game of London 
booksellers. Artistic beauty of any kind is inevit- 
ably at a premium. Comparatively few modern pro- 
ductions, even when printed by hand on hand-made 
paper, are as attractive as the commonest manual 
or treatise of the fifteenth century. The volumes 
which composed the Grolier library of three hun- 
dred years ago are now treated as veritable works 
of art ; they have their catalogue, like the pictures 
of a great painter or the plates of a great engraver, 
and are numbered. Erery existing book bound for 
Grolier has its pedigree, and is traced lovingly from 
catalogue to catalogue of the great collectors. 

The rarity that is " achieved " results in a some- 
what fanciful and fluctuating form of value, being 
affected by artificial diminution of the supply, as by 
destructions through fire, invading armies, and like 
calamities, in some cases also by destructions through 
exceeding popularity. The plunder of the Pisistra- 
tian collection by Xerxes ; the burning of one-half 
of the Alexandrian library by the soldiers of Julius 
Caesar, and of the other half some seven hundred 
years later by the Khalif Omar ; the ravages of the 
Goths, and of the French, Spanish, and German 
invaders of Italy, and scores of other mediaeval 
calamities, these and later accidents and crimes 
have swelled the tale of valuable books which are no 
more, or exist only in such quantity as to be prac- 
tically introuvable. Mr. Powell suggests that the 
librarian of King Osymandias, whose collection was 
formed, we are told, " less than four centuries after 
the Flood," might have been able to tell us some- 
thing of the literature already known to be destroyed 
at that date ! We are not to assume that high-priced 
catalogues, or auction duels terminating in rounds 
of applause, are things belonging to the nineteenth 
century. This first of libraries possibly possessed 
some priceless relic which the Brunet of the day 
would have described as " Ouvrage assez ancien ; 
Exemplaire portant 1'autographe de Japhet; Quel- 
qties feuilles mouillees par le Deluge" 

Of books that " have rarity thrust upon them," 
the most conspicuous are those which, by rising to 
the high-water mark of the free thought of the age, 
have been persecuted or summarily suppressed by 
authority, bigotry, or high-placed corruption. One 



of the rarest books in existence is the tract of Ser- 
vetus entitled Christianismi Restitutio, of which 
only one copy is known now to exist, nearly all the 
edition having been burned with the author, at the 
instigation of his former friend, Calvin, in 1558 ; 
and next might come the same author's three tracts 
on the Trinity, printed in italics, 1532. A work of 
which only two or three copies are said to be known 
is the Cymbalum Mundi (1537). Every kind of 
shocking impiety was long attributed to the author, 
till at last it occurred to one eminent bibliographer 
of the last century to read the book, which he ac- 
cordingly did, and found it of quite depressing pro- 
priety. 

During the interesting period of the revival of 
learning and thought, ecclesiastical damnation came 
to confer upon the volumes it honored a sort of hall- 
mark of excellence, or at least of candor and orig- 
inality, and the most select catalogue of books or- 
dered " to be burnt by the common hangman " would 
be very long indeed. Thus, often, bibliography be- 
comes a very material part of history. Many indeed 
are the books whose appearance marks the accession 
of something far more important than king or queen, 
nay of that which often may destroy kings, queens, 
and existing conventions generally, to-wit, a new 
idea. The final ripening of scientific conclusions, 
the impatient outbursts of long-shackled humor and 
good sense, the explosions of oppressed suffering, 
and the exultant happiness of peace and secured 
civilization all these leave their mark in the rec- 
ords of bibliography, and are more important and 
more interesting than all the official Acts of Sov- 
ereigns and States. 

Mr. W. Roberts's small volume on " Rare Books 
and their Prices " ought to rebuke all who scorn the 
enthusiasm of the collector. Here, the antiquity of 
collecting is shown to be almost as great as that of 
the world itself, and the spirit of the collector to 
have undergone but little change during the last two 
thousand years. The list of collectors in ancient 
Rome includes many illustrious names, e. g., Sallust 
the historian, in whose garden the Dying Gladiator 
was found ; Asinus Pollio, the orator, poet, histo- 
rian, and friend of Augustus, who once owned the 
Toro Farnese, now at Naples ; whilst even Anthony 
and Brutus stand before the world clearly convicted 
of the hobby for collecting. The collecting instinct 
being more or less deeply grained in human nature, 
the difference between the boy who accumulates 
postage stamps or letter-heads and the man who 
collects books or pictures is simply a difference of 
taste and of money, and not of spirit. Mr. Roberts 
takes up the subject in the four departments of 
Books, Pictures, Pottery and Porcelain, and Post- 
age Stamps. 

For notable acquisitions in any of these fields, 
nothing is plainer than that one has need to be as 
rich as Croesus, or the person typified as the " Chi- 
cago pork-butcher." To speak of books alone, we 
are told of one volume, the Psalmorum Codex, 
printed by Fust and Schseff er in 1459, which brought 



1896.]

the extraordinary sum of 4950. This is the high- 
est price ever paid for a single book, and it is un- 
doubtedly the grandest specimen of typographic art 
in existence. It is the second book printed with a 
date. The very first works of the earliest printers 
have never been excelled in the beauty of their ex- 
ecution, and they will for all time stand as an incen- 
tive as well as a reproach to modern printers. 

The editions of the English Bible printed during 
the earlier half of the sixteenth century maintain 
high prices, but anything like a fair comparison is 
difficult, as the copies which have come under the 
hammer during the last fifty years vary much in 
the degree to which they are imperfect. The theory 
that reading a book sometimes becomes a deadly 
sin, assumes, in the eyes of a collector, a very prac- 
tical form in connection with the early English 
Bibles. The Bible's extreme popularity with our 
forefathers, as a book to read, makes perfect copies 
extremely rare. An absolutely complete example 
would probably bring over 1000. 

Of the publications of Caxton, England's first 
printer, there are about 560 examples in existence. 
The highest sum ever paid for a Caxton is 1950, 
the book being the Harleian copy of " King Arthur" 
(the only perfect copy known), and the purchaser 
{" unfortunately, and to the lasting disgrace of En- 
gland," according to Mr. Roberts), an American 
collector, Mrs. Pope. 

The works of Shakespeare, so far as the original 
quartos and folios are concerned, yield to no other 
in their advance in price among book-fanciers. At 
the time of publication, the quartos sold for a few 
pence. Now they sometimes realize between 300 
and 400. Of the first folio, a matchless copy is 
priced by a bookseller at 1200. 

The attraction of a first edition over the second 
or subsequent issues falls into the category of 
things which are ffot explainable on ordinary prin- 
ciples. A writer in the " Speaker " has described 
the " mania " for first editions as a " purely spirit- 
ual joy," and, as with all spiritual joys, the expe- 
rience thereof is a thing of feeling and not of argu- 
ment. The first editions of Thackeray and Dickens 
realize very high prices when they possess the 
printed covers and the advertisements of the orig- 
inal parts. To the lay mind, a tastefully bound vol- 
ume offers attractions not possessed by a set of 
" parts " in their dingy wrappers ; but not so to the 
collector. The " Poems by Two Brothers," as issued 
in 1827, in boards and with a paper label at the 
back, costs ten times as much as the most beautiful 
-complete modern edition of Tennyson ; and a set of 
the latest complete edition of Browning's works, 
substantially bound, in all sixteen volumes, costs less 
than a single copy of " Bells and Pomegranates " in 
the original parts. 

The outward and visible mark of the citizenship 
of the book-lover is his book-plate. To have a book- 
plate gives a collector great serenity and self-confi- 
dence, since few borrowers will have the temerity 
to ask for the loan of a volume dignified by a book- 



plate. To the list of authorities in this branch of art 
must now be added Norna Labouchere, who writes 
of " Ladies' Book-plates " in a beautiful and elabo- 
rately illustrated volume. The aim of the work is to 
trace the history of women's plates, and to give some 
account of those ex-libris which seem to call for spe- 
cial attention, either from the interest attached to 
their owners or for the intrinsic merit of the designs. 

The plates of men and women ought to be essen- 
tially different. A spinster bears her paternal arms 
on a lozenge ; a married woman bears her paternal 
arms impaled with those of her husband on a shield, 
or if she is an heiress, or co-heiress, her husband 
marshals them upon his shield charged as an es- 
cutcheon of pretence ; a widow bears the same, but 
on a lozenge instead of a shield. Men continually 
adorn their plates with the figure of a woman, but 
women have seldom returned the compliment. The 
modern book-plate is commonly a pictorial effort to 
describe in one small vignette the varied tastes of 
the owner and the miscellaneous contents of the 
volumes of his library. Rumor has it that the inev- 
itable bicycle has even made its appearance upon a 
lady's book-plate. Incongruous as this seems for 
a library, possibly the fleet wheels might serve as 
symbol of the swift flight of time when a book is 
the companion. 

Delightful as one may find it to linger in the 
realms of the four books we have discussed, yet for- 
tunate indeed is it that no one need be unhappy if 
debarred from the luxuries and splendors which 
they describe. For is not a happiness still greater 
to be found in a small working library where the 
books are well selected and thoughtfully arranged 
in accordance with one central code of taste, and 
may be consulted respectfully at any moment by the 
master of their destinies ? Even so genuine a book- 
lover and ardent a collector as Edmund Gosse has 
declared : " If fortune made me possessor of a book 
of excessive value, I should hasten to part with it. 
In a little working library, to hold a first quarto of 
'Hamlet' would be like entertaining a reigning 
monarch in a small farmhouse at harvesting."

as they originally stood, were addressed to varying 
audiences of students, and hence contain more or 
less iteration of leading facts and insistence on ele- 
mental principles which, however well adapted to 
class-room exposition, may seem superfluous to the 
reader. But the book is of course extremely read- 
able and suggestive. It would have been next to 
impossible for Mr. Froude to be trite or dull on any 
subject ; and in the Reformation he had a theme to 
stimulate to the utmost the peculiar pungency of his 
trenchant pen. Nearly two-thirds of the volume is 
occupied with the story of the Reformation, from 
the " monkish squabble " (as Pope Leo phrased it) 
over indulgences, up to the convening of the Coun- 
cil in 1545 ; the remainder being mainly devoted to 
the manifold diplomatic shifts and the doctrinal and 
disciplinary wranglings of that notable conclave, 
down to its suspension in 1552, upon the advance 
on Innspruck of Maurice of Saxony. This advance, 
we may say in passing, Mr. Froude inclines to think 
was a matter of collusion between Maurice and the 
Emperor, and not, as is commonly held, an act of 
treachery on the part of the former. There was 
certainly something both noble and pathetic in the 
long struggle of Charles V. to save the unity of 
Christendom by pacific measures, and to quench the 
flames of the odium theologicum with the sweet 
waters of reason and charity ; and it seems not im- 
probable that the utter failure of his naive hopes of 
bringing warring ecclesiastics to compromise their 
doctrinal differences like reasonable men, and to 
secure the peace of Europe on a basis of broad apos- 
tolic Christianity, may have caused him at last to 
wash his hands indignantly of the entire matter. 
The advance of Maurice on Innspruck came in May, 
1552, and the peace of Passau followed in July, 
establishing toleration in Germany a sort of mo- 
dus vivendi which lasted till the bitter and devas- 
tating ordeal of the Thirty Years' War ; and Charles 
V., as our author notes, took no part in the settle- 
ment, and interested himself no further in the quar- 
rels of Pope and Protestant. While Mr. Froude 
clearly holds throughout a brief for the Reformers, 
he relies mainly on the testimony of Catholic writ- 
ers accepting for the nonce Cardinal Newman's 
charitable view that Protestant tradition in the case 
is founded on "bold, wholesale, and unscrupulous 
lying." That there may have been some mild pre- 
varication on the other side as well, seems probable ; 
but, nevertheless, Mr. Froude rests his cause on 
' Catholic documents of undoubted authenticity, on 
the testimony of Catholic witnesses antecedent to or 
contemporary with the Reformation." His main 
contention is that the Reformation was originally 
and essentially a moral and laical rather than a doc- 
trinal revolt. The Church had grown scandalously 
corrupt and unbearably tyrannical ; and Europe rose 
to demand a general cleansing of the Augean stables. 
The Church, conscious of guilt and dreading scru- 
tiny, resisted reform, resented the interference of 
the laity, ingeniously turned the moral controversy 
into a doctrinal one, and the great schism fol- 



lowed. " The garment without seam was torn ;'* 
and upon the papal party mainly rested the blame. 
Just how far the reforming zeal of the princes may 
have been inflamed and alloyed by their desire to 
lay hold of church property (almost a third of the 
land in Germany was in the hands of the clergy), 
Mr. Froude omits to say ; but candor compels us to 
admit a considerable tincture of regard for selfish 
and material interests in the stoutest supporters of 
the Reformation. To the German princes especially, 
the broad domains of the Church formed a glitter- 
ing bait. To the common assertion that the Reform- 
ation " settled nothing," Mr. Froude replies, pretty 
effectually, that every one of the abuses complained 
of by the laity has been swept away : " Popes no 
longer depose princes, dispense with oaths, or ab- 
solve subjects from their allegiance. Appeals are 
not any more carried to Rome from the national 
tribunals, nor justice sold there to the highest bid- 
der. Felonious priests suffer for their crimes like 
unconsecrated mortals. Too zealous prelates can- 
not call poor creatures before them ex officio, cross- 
question them on their beliefs, fine, imprison, or 
burn them at the stake. Excommunications are 
kept in bounds by the law of libel. Itinerant pardon- 
vendors no longer hawk through Europe their un- 
profitable wares. . . . These scandals are gone, and 
the devoutest Romanists would not wish to revive 
them." It would have been not only generous but 
just in Mr. Froude to follow his somewhat harsh 
indictment of the Romish Church by a tribute to 
the superb reforming movement which took place in 
that body under the pontiffs who held sway during 
the latter half of the sixteenth century. When the 
Church finally armed herself to combat heresy, her 
first care was to check the scandals which men like 
Cardinal Julian, Contarini, Sadoleto, and Caraffa 
had long deplored.

The coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire put an end 
to the Directory, and so formally relegated Barras 
to private life. From that date to the time of his

the arena of politics, is much more interesting than 
its immediate predecessor, since Barras remained 
to the end one of the closest and hest-informed ob- 
servers of public events of his day, keeping in close 
touch with the chief actors, intriguing and plotting 
during the period of the Consulate and of the Em- 
pire, and even playing, in a way, the part of con- 
sulting statesman to Louis XVIII., Charles X., and 
their Ministers. Like the earlier volumes, the con- 
cluding ones bristle with piquant personalities. The 
Jacobinical Viscount was preeminently a man who 
dared call a spade a spade ; and one rejoices, for 
the credit of human nature in general, that his ran- 
corous accounts of most of his leading contempo- 
raries must be rather freely discounted. Bonaparte 
is, as before, the main target for his shafts ; and 
we are inclined to think that, with all its exaggera- 
tions, and perhaps falsehoods, the picture he draws 
of his arch-enemy contains elements of essential 
truth which conscientious historians must reckon 
with in the future. Barras was unquestionably a 
strong and able, if an unprincipled, man. He ex- 
ploited more adroitly than any other leading rev- 
olutionist, except perhaps his fellow -Provencal, 
Bare*re, the events of the time to his own profit ; and 
his record of those events, while somewhat warped 
and discolored by his personal animosities and invet- 
erate bent for calumny, cannot be read without deep 
interest and (if read discriminatingly) profit. The 
copious introductory matter, furnished by M. George 
Duruy, forms at once an admirable historical study 
of the period embraced by the Memoirs, and a use- 
ful touchstone by which its more doubtful elements 
may be tested. M. Duruy has a very low opinion 
of Barras, and a correspondingly high one of Na- 
poleon ; so that, between author and editor, the ju- 
dicious reader should be able to arrive at a pretty 
accurate judgment. The volumes are well translated 
and handsomely made containing seven portraits 
in photogravure, together vriihfac similes, -plans, etc. 

Under the title " Historical Essays " 
ittp Lightfooe, (Macmillan), the trustees of the 

historical essay t. i . , ' i i 

Lightfoot fund have gathered to- 
gether several miscellaneous papers of a historic 
nature, written at odd times since 1872 by the late 
Bishop Lightfoot of Durham. Marked by zealous 
research and careful comparisons of authorities, the 
unfinished essay on the " Manor-House of Auck- 
land " is likely to interest the student who cares for 
out-of-the-way things in the history of English archi- 
tecture. In its fragmentary shape, however, it seems 
hardly worth publishing. In the four other papers 
which make up the volume the reader will seldom 
forget that he is listening to a churchman. At the 
game time, it must be said that these papers are 
charming in style, and admirably constructed to 
bring into clear outline the subjects with which they 
are concerned. " Christian Life in the Second and 
Third Centuries," the first paper, delivered as three 
lectures in 1872 at St. Paul's Cathedral, before 
Lightfoot was called to Durham, indicates at the 



outset the author's constructive power. From a mass 
of material he has chosen a few telling incidents 
which serve to trace the slow but steady growth of 
Christianity during its most critical stage. Passing 
by the paper on the " Comparative Progress of An- 
cient and Modern Missions," with its several rather 
startling conclusions, the reader will find himself 
under the guidance of a delightful companion in the 
course of the essay entitled " England during the 
Latter Half of the Thirteenth Century." The esti- 
mates of such men as Earl Simon de Montfort, 
Edward I., and Roger Bacon, are judicious and 
strong. An interesting comparison is drawn between 
the Pointed English architecture of the age of Ed- 
ward and the Doric style of Greece in the days of 
Pericles. The concluding study of "Donne, the 
Poet-Preacher " gives a glimpse of that curious fig- 
ure among English churchmen. Throughout the 
volume, but notably in the last essay, the reader 
cannot escape the spell of Bishop Lightfoot's per- 
sonality : the themes were his favorites, and his 
finely-wrought mind dwelt upon them in a noble and 

inspiring way. 

A beautiful memorial volume has

among the friends of the late Mrs. 
George Rowswell Grant, of Chicago, whose untimely 
demise two years ago was noted in these pages. 
Genevieve Grahame Grant was the daughter of Mr. 
and Mrs. Fernando Jones, and was a woman of re- 
markable intellectual attainments and social charm. 
She was best known to the public as the founder, in 
1889, of the Twentieth Century Club of Chicago, 
while by the large circle of her friends, which included 
many of the most distinguished people of America 
and Europe, she is remembered as a woman of grace- 
ful presence, rare tact, and keen intellectual sym- 
pathies. The memorial volume which is the occa- 
sion of these remarks includes two portraits, a brief 
but satisfactory memoir by the loving hand of " one 
who knew her almost from her cradle to her grave,' r 
a number of her contributions to various papers (in- 
cluding THE DIAL), a selection from her correspond- 
ence, and a tribute to her activity in connection with- 
the Twentieth Century Club. Perhaps the most strik- 
ing thing included is the text of an address made by 
her, in French, when a mere girl, before the Paris 
International Woman's Rights Congress of 1878.

entitled " The Last Years of St. Andrews " (Long-

churches, and church dignitaries. His style is

notable for its purity and simplicity, although it 
occasionally becomes a trifle diffuse, and is always 
lacking in strength. The author has the Boswellian 
delight for details, and tells all his stories with a 
naive exactness. Dr. Boyd should console himself 
with the thought that when Mr. Lowell said his 
"Recreations of a Country Parson " was " the dull- 
est book he ever read," he was not nearly so careful 
&s to the absolute truth of his statement as is Dr. 
Boyd himself when he says of a certain sermon : 
" It would be overbold to say the sermon was the 
dullest and stupidest I ever heard : because one's 
experience is large. But I can say truly I never 
heard a duller or stupider." Perhaps this is what 
Mr. Lowell really meant, forgetting for the moment 
that " one's experience is large." In view of this 
criticism, it was rather injudicious for Dr. Boyd to 
make the sweeping statement that he has found all 
of Mr. Lowell's "famous writings, both in prose 
and verse," " tiresome," and his explanation of this 
inability to appreciate each other's literary work as 
" a deficiency in nature " is certainly amusing. 

Mr. Stephen on " ' rhe Duties of Authors," one of the 
Social Eights chapters of Mr. Leslie Stephen's 
nd Duties. ^ "Social Rights and Duties" (Mac- 
millan) was commented upon by us at some length 
in a recent issue of THE DIAL. The two volumes 
of which this work consists are made up of addresses 
delivered to the Ethical Societies of London upon 
various occasions, discussing a variety of subjects of 
social interest, such as "The Sphere of Political 
Economy," " The Vanity of Philosophizing," " For- 
gotten Benefactors," " Heredity," " Punishment," 
and ' Luxury." These addresses are in a more pop- 
ular vein than most of Mr. Stephen's work, but it 
is hardly necessary to say that they make no con- 
cessions to commonplace minds, or that they reveal 
one of the deepest and most genial of living thinkers. 
Contact with such an intellect as Mr. Stephen's is 
Always in the highest degree stimulating, for the 
author has a happy faculty for clothing abstract 
truth and close reasoning in the most fascinating 
garb of expression. The Societies for whom these 
lectures were prepared are much to be envied, and 
the larger reading public is to be congratulated upon 
the access to them now afforded. 



A substantial The vei 7 striking paper entitled " Is 
philosophy of Life Worth Living ? " contributed by 
Optimism. Professor William James to a recent 

number of " The International Journal of Ethics," 
has been reprinted fn a neat booklet by Mr. S. Burns 
Weston, of Philadelphia. We wish that the essay 
might find its way to many thousands of readers, for 
it is both impressive and helpful. The writer holds 
a brief for optimism, it is true ; but he knows how 
worthless are the stock arguments for the optimistic 
view, and, instead of sheltering himself behind the 
shallow platitudes that we hear so often, seeks in 
the very heart of philosophical thought for his refu- 
tation of the pessimist. The essential thesis is that 



" our whole physical life may lie soaking in a spirit- 
ual atmosphere, a dimension of Being that we at 
present have no organ for apprehending." " I con- 
fess," the author goes on to say, " that I do not see 
why the very existence of an invisible world may 
not in part depend on the personal response which 
any one of us may make to the religious appeal. 
God himself, in short, may draw vital strength and 
increase of very being from our fidelity. For my 
own part, I do not know what the sweat and blood 
and tragedy of this life mean, if they mean anything 
short of this. If this life be not a real fight in which 
something is eternally gained for the Universe by 
success, it is no better than a game of private the- 
atricals from which one may withdraw at will. But 
it feels like a real fight ; as if there were something 
really wild in the Universe which we, with all our 
idealities and faithfulnesses, are needed to redeem." 

One of the most amusing papers in 
Schopenhauer's "Nachlass" is de- 
voted to a series of rules and prac- 
tical suggestions on " The Art of Controversy." It 
describes thirty-eight stratagems, or Kunstgriffe, 
that may be employed in argument, and illustrates 
most of them by example. The discussion is as cyn- 
ical as Machiavelli's " Prince," and its avowed aim 
is to enable disputants to hold their own, per fas et 
nefas. We have long wished that someone might 
translate this essay, and are glad to note that Mr. 
T. Bailey Saunders has at last added it, together 
with a few other papers, to the series of volumes in 
which the body of Schopenhauer's minor writings is 
presented to English readers (Macmillan). It makes 
the sixth volume of the series, and is to be followed 
by one more. We may find space for one of the 
simpler Kunstgriffe : " If you observe that your 
opponent has taken up a line of argument which 
will end in your defeat, you must not allow him to 
carry it to its conclusion, but interrupt the course of 
the dispute in time, or break it off altogether, or 
lead him away from the subject, and bring him to 
others. In short, you must effect the trick which 
will be noticed later on, the mutatlo controversies." 

It is, we believe, one of the notes of 
For architects genius that, in speaking of what is 

and others. , ' . r . . 

here and now, it proves also to be 
speaking of what is always and everywhere. Whether 
the author who has taken the evil name of Solomon 
Gargoyle be a genius or not, is fortunately not to 
be definitely settled by these lines. But it is worth 
first mention, that although what is said of " Five 
Sins of an Architect " (Riverton Press) is said by 
an architect and of architectural matters, it is also 
of broader scope, and has therefore the especial 
charm of all work that is appreciably suggestive. 
In putting his finger on some of the weak places of 
architecture, the author indicates also some of the 
weaknesses of the larger structure of society ; his 
conception of a good architect, also, is not without 
its bearing on our conception of a good man. One

reads with a wider interest than would be excited 
in the general mind by a discussion of the faults 
and follies of any especial profession or art. But 
in dealing with a particular way of life, it has the 
advantage attaching to concrete cases. It is, then, 
a book which one will read with pleasure and pos- 
sibly to further advantage. We regret that we can- 
not say that " there is not a dull page in it ": in 
truth, the author is not always at his best as must 
of course be true of every honest man. Nor is he 
uniformly impeccable (giving evidence of some pet 
sins of his own), but it will be more amusing to the 
reader to detect the said sins himself, and thereby 
taste the joy of commenting on the critic. 

Professor Bernard Moses, in " The 
Railwa 7 Revolution in Mexico " (The 
Berkeley Press, San Francisco), 
deals with the changed industrial and material con- 
ditions of our southwestern neighbor, which have 
succeeded the recent and extensive building of rail- 
roads in that country. He shows that by the influx 
and use of foreign capital in the building of rail- 
roads within the past two decades, Mexico, hitherto 
an isolated country, "has suddenly been brought 
under the influences that make for social changes, 
and we discover here an excellent example of the 
transition from a stagnant to a progressive society." 
There is no attempt at exhaustive treatment, the 
book contains but ninety pages, but the author dis- 
cusses, successively, the order which has followed 
out of this new means of transportation, the ma- 
terial and moral improvement of the population, 
the opening of new and unworked fields for agricul- 
tural enterprise, and, especially, the wholesome eco- 
nomic effect which this new influence has had upon 
the cities of the interior. The story is pleasingly 
told and will repay a careful perusal. A map of 
Mexico would have added not a little to the interest 

of the book. 

"Governments of the World To- 
<%>" % Mr. Hamblen Sears, is well 
calculated to interest the busy indi- 
vidual who wishes to keep in touch with current 
events in all parts of the globe. Indeed, it may be 
truly said, as appears on the title-page, that the book 
is " an outline for newspaper readers." It aims to 
give satisfactory answers to " references to contem- 
porary events, domestic and foreign, to men and 
things, which no paper can pretend to explain, which, 
in fact, the editors must take for granted as familiar 
to their readers." Useful statistical and historical 
information is given of forty-eight different govern- 
ments, alphabetically, beginning with the Argentine 
Eepublic and ending with Venezuela. These are 
followed with an appendix discussing briefly some 
features of a dozen other independent sovereign 
states. Maps are given of most of the countries 
treated, but they are so very small as to be of little 
value to the reader. An interesting table, showing 
the areas, populations, and other data of the British 
colonies, is found at the end of the book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The bound volume of " The Century " magazine which 
includes the numbers from November, 1895, to April, 
1896, is at hand, and is as full of interesting matter as 
any of its predecessors. Among the more noticeable 
features are Mr. H. M. Stanley's account of " The De- 
velopment of Africa," Mr. C. E. Borchgrevink's story 
of " The First Landing on the Antarctic Continent," 
Mr. Bryce's discussion of " The Armenian Question," 
and Mr. Marion Crawford's two papers on Rome. The 
serials include Professor Sloane's " Life of Napoleon," 
Mrs. Ward's " Sir George Tressady," and Mr. Hopkin- 
son Smith's " Tom Grogan." The illustrations are, of 
course, as distinctive and valuable a feature as ever. 

The cante-fable of " Aucassin et Nicolete " has hith- 
erto been known to English readers only in Mr. Lang's 
exquisite version. A new translation, the work of Mr. 
M. S. Henry and Mr. E. W. Thomson, now appears 
in one of the prettiest booklets imaginable from the 
press of Messrs. Copeland & Day. While we cannot 
say that the present translators have caught the flavor 
of the original quite as successfully as did Mr. Lang, 
they have nevertheless produced a very charming version 
of one of the loveliest strays of mediaeval literature. 

Madame Darmesteter's charming monograph on 
" Froissart " (imported by Scribner) has been translated 
into English by Miss E. Frances Poynter, and published 
in a volume that is made almost sumptuous by hand- 
some print, heavy paper, and illustrative plates. It is 
a beautiful book in spirit no less than in form, full of 
poetic feeling and sympathetic appreciation. It must 
surely help to make Froissart better known than he now 
is to English readers, and that is no unworthy task. 
The freshness and purity of the old Chronicler at his 
best are things " that will never lose their value," but 
are likely rather to become more and more prized as 
the world grows older. 

Mr. S. Baring-Gould describes his " Curiosities of 
Olden Times " (Whittaker), as " a small museum " 
wherein he has preserved some of the quaintest relics 
which have attracted his notice during his antiquarian 
labors. The book certainly points to a vast overhauling 
of dusty tomes; and the author presents his sufficiently 
curious odds-and-ends of forgotten lore and tradition in 
a sprightly and agreeable way. There are seventeen 
papers in all, under such titles as: "The Meaning of 
Mourning; " " Curiosities of Cypher; " " Strange Pains 
and Penalties; " " Some Crazy Saints; " " Sortes Sacne; " 
"Queen Culprits;" "The Philosopher's Stone;" etc. 
The book is full of curious and suggestive reading. 

"A Dictionary of Chemical Solubilities" (Macmillan), 
by Dr. Arthur Messinger Correy, has just been pub- 
lished. It is a work of enormous industry, and, although 
it deals only with inorganic substances, and is printed in 
the most compact form possible, fills over five hundred 
double-columned octavo pages. Storer's " Dictionary," 
published in 1864, is the only previous attempt to deal 
with this subject, and, of course, the accumulated de- 
terminations of the past thirty years have added greatly 
to the material to be embodied in such a work. The 
authorities are given for the determinations, but no at- 
tempt has been made to verify them experimentally, 
and they often contradict one another. Recent work is 
likelv to be more accurate than earlier, and that is the 
nearest approach that may be made toward any general 
rule. Every chemist will find this work indispensable.

was born December 31, 1814, and died on the eighth 
of this month. His early life was that of a scholar and 
teacher, and we think of him chiefly during this period 
as the pupil of Cousin, and afterwards as his successor 
at the Sorbonne. He lectured there for twelve years, be- 
ginning in 1839. He entered politics in 1848 as a mem- 
ber of the Constituent Assembly, and took his seat with 
the Left. The loss of his professorship, in 1851, was the 
consequence of his refusal to accept the Empire of the 
usurper. In this connection, he published " Le Devoir," 
"La Liberte" Commune," and "La Liberte* de Con- 
science." During the sixties, he published numerous 
books, among them " L'Ouvriere," " L'Ouvrier de Huit 
Ans," "La Politique Radicale," and "La Peine de 
Mort." He also entered the Corps Le'gislatif, and soon 
became the leader of the Republican party. His first 
appointment as Minister was under the temporary gov- 
ernment of National Defence during the war of 1870. 
In 1871, Thiers gave him the portfolio of Education, 
which he held for two years. Later, he published an 
eloquent defence of " Le Gouvernement de Monsieur 
Thiers." In 1875 he was elected a life senator and 
also to the Academy, while in 1876 he became Premier. 
In 1890, he was a delegate to the Labor Conference 
called at Berlin by the German Emperor. He was 
throughout his career the earnest supporter of free 
trade, of the republican principle, of arbitration for 
international difficulties, and of the whole set of ideas 
commonly, if somewhat vaguely, designated as liberal.

THE 

STEARNS BICYCLE 

IS 

The Epitome of Comfort, 

And a perpetual delight to its owner. So easily 
is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed 
the " easy-running Stearns "; and so truly have 
its builders gauged the wants of the average 
rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory 
mount can be found anywhere. The STEARNS 
is one of those few wheels which improve upon 
acquaintance. The more thorough the trial which 
is given it, the better it is liked.
