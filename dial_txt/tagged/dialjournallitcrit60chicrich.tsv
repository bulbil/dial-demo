		39 FACT , TRUTH , FICTION , AND THE STORY .

		Might it not straighten out matters for us a little , I sometimes wonder , if we were to throw overboard some of our verbal ballast , for instance , the word '' fiction '' and the word `` novel '' ?

		The first would probably sink of its own clumsy weight , and trouble us no more ; and the other , when we had let it out of its gilt cage , would skitter off into the thin air where it belongs , and we should not have that pet to take care of in the future .

		Very likely we should miss them at first ; but what a relief to discover , as time went on , that we were no longer fuddling ourselves and others with talk about '' realistic fiction , '' and -LRB- shade of Boccaccio ! -RRB-

		`` novels of ideas , '' and such strange cattle !

		What luxury to be , as it were , alone on a wide , wide sea , with no critical baggage aboard but a few simple words like `` story '' and `` story-telling '' !

		How much easier , when we fell into the in - evitable discussion of So-and-so 's latest , to make out what the other fellow might be talk - ing about !

		How much more possible for him to get an inkling , now and then , as to what we were driving at !

		The muddle we have got into over this whole business of '' fiction '' is amazing , when one thinks of it .

		Poetry is a still more boggy theme , to be sure , let us hasten to turn our backs on it .

		Fact , truth , fiction , the real , the romantic , the ideal .

		are these live words ?

		Or are they dead counters , to be shuffled about as we will ?

		It was a long time ago that Pilate clinched his immortality by merely inquiring .

		What was Truth ?

		A good many centuries later somebody was it Byron ?

		remarked that It was stranger than Fiction .

		But we are now being earnestly assured on many hands that Fiction is at least as true as Truth .

		And barking at our heels , while we try to engage each other in quiet literary conversation , is the rude word '' Fact , '' demanding that some one shall pay it a little attention , and tell us what it is .

		and where it came from , and what it is doing at the party .

		Now the truth is , fact is often fiction but let us pause for a moment , and advance with every appearance of caution .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	I suppose the meaning of
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's famous inquiry was , `` What is the deep and abiding reality in life ? ''

		Every nian must answer that for himself in a way , and does answer it .

		He has various aids in formulating his an - swer , experience , observation , religion , even art .

		But of course
Byron	PERSON	was n't thinking of an abstraction .

		What he meant was simply that the things that happen , the facts of expe - rience , are often more strikingly improbable than the things that are imagined .

		We all know this is true , we need only read the newspapers to have it brought home to us every week .

		Coincidences happen , bits of lurid incident take place before our eyes , which a theatre audience would laugh at .

		There are interventions of chance , feats of heroism , eventualities so startling that no manager of melodrama or '' movie '' would dare ask an audience to credit them .

		Here is one that , because I heard of it at first-hand , made more impression on me than if I had read it in a newspaper .

		It is literally true , I know that ; and it is utterly preposterous , you could not make a story of it that anybody would believe .

		An undertaker was leaving home for two days .

		There was a sick woman at a neighbor 's boarding-house , a stranger in the village .

		The landlady was afraid the woman would die while the undertaker was away .

		He said she might be laid out in his own parlor till his return : his wife is used to things and does n't mind , though she will be alone in the house .

		He returns late the second night , he is not expected home till morning .

		There is a light in the parlor .

		He lets himself in , finds the sheeted figure he has half-expected , uncovers the face with a pro- fessional hand : it is his wife .

		Now the mere fact is easily explained ; but there is no use in explaining such a thing for the purposes of the story-teller .

		It is too preposterously neat in its tragic irony .

		This happened some years ago , two miles north of my desk .

		Only the other day , two miles south of it , there was another incident which for bitter squalid pathos no `` natu - ralist '' could overmatch : the death , in every circumstance of meaningless horror , of a negro washerwoman .

		I shall not tell that thing .

		If the other incident had its element of artistic irony too complete for credibility , this one -LRB- am I here betraying a creed out - worn ? -RRB-

		is quite as complete in its disability for sane interpretation .

		It remains in my mind as one of those human experiences which we rightly try to keep in their places as mere items of sordid and sickening fact .

		It will not do to dwell upon them and magnify them : that way madness lies .

		Many such facts , it is true , are now employed as a basis for the thing called fiction , or for the '' story '' in the journalistic sense .

		But for the art of story - telling , they do not exist .

		You see what we win by narrowing our vocabulary .

		When we speak of a story , we are thinking of something fairly concrete and intelligible .

		For a story , if it is worth telling , is a thing organic , or at least composed .

		It hangs together , has a beginning , a middle , and an end , has , above all , a meaning .

		Read a tale in .

		the Arabian Nights , or in
Boccaccio	LOCATION	, and you have the story in its essence .

		You may expand or vary it indefi - nitely , in substance or in meaning , and yet not change its nature .

		If the golden material is there , the size of the product is largely -LRB- I do n't say altogether -RRB- a question of arrange - ment .

		Every story has , perhaps , its natural , or preferable , scale .

		But I confess myself pretty skeptical as to the value of all our talk about a distinct and '' new '' art of the short story .

		Many of the best stories of our time are in the short form .

		But is this true alto - gether because they were preordained for that form , or partly because the longer form which we call the novel has been so generally di - verted to other uses than the uses of story - telling ?

		Having been a reviewer for many years , I may own that , for my part , I have been unceasingly engaged in extricating my - self from the labyrinths of modern '' fiction '' by hanging to the clue of the story .

		I do n't mean by this the `` plot . ''

		What , then , do I mean ?

		How do I know a story when I see one ?

		What is a `` good story , '' giving the phrase its highest possible mean - ing ?

		Well , I shall content myself with saying that I think I have and that very many of us have a natural instinct about that , if we do not permit ourselves to be robbed of it .

		But many of the people who use the extended story form , or something like it , and many of the people who praise them for having writ - ten something other than a story under cover of that form , are very busy trying to rob us of just this instinct .

		To begin with , they ask us to believe that a novel is something differ - ent from a story , and that it is something bigger and better .

		I believe that the great
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL novels are first of all great stories , and that we love them for that , however much we may admire them for other things .

		And if I be - lieve that '' Pride and Prejudice '' and '' The Rise of
Silas Lapham	PERSON	'' are great books , as well as '' Ivanhoe '' or '' The Scarlet Letter , '' it is because I believe that , scale , manner , intel - lectual , moral , aesthetic , and other accessories apart , they are all great examples of the story-teller 's art .

		It is for this reason that I deplore our servility in the presence of sundry set and unduly emphasized distinctions as between realism and romanticism , between the novel of incident and the novel of character or of fact or of ideas .

		These distinctions are all useful enough as far as they go .

		But it is not necessary to bow down to them as before a row of idols .

		There is infinite gradation in these matters .

		The attempt to draw hard and fast lines has got criticism into such a mess that we are now fain to pull ourselves out with the aid of monstrous categories like `` romantic realism , '' `` realistic romance / ' and so on .

		A good deal of light is thrown upon one of the places that have been darkened by this sort of counsel in a recent '' Nation '' article by Mr.
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	.

		His immediate object is a searching and scorching analy - sis of the books of Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, of course , is a professed realist .

		He is out after the truth with a small t ; no gloss of imagination or theory is to sully with its gold the pure tin of his pages .

		Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- man points out the fact that , like all realists who are in any sense whatever story-tellers , Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's work , instead of a ruthless camera-process , represents a clear and con - sistent -LRB- if paltry -RRB- interpretation of life . ''

		There is no such thing , '' says Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, '' as a ' cross-section ' or ' slice ' or ' photo - graph ' of life in art least of all in the real - istic novel .

		The use of these words is but a clever hypnotizing pass of the artist , em - ployed to win the assent of the reader to the reality of the show , and , in some cases , to evade moral responsibility for any questiona - ble features of the exhibition .

		A realistic novel no more than any other type of novel can escape being a composition , involving pre - conception , imagination , and divination . ''

		And what does this mean but that , as we are saying , the novel , in so far as it is a work of art , is , for a ' that and a ' that , a story : an interpreting narrative , as definitely inspired , and at its height as purely wrought , as a poem or a statue .

		As for Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, nature gave him the story-telling instinct , and he happened to find his material in his own back yard .

		In his first book , '' Sister Carrie , '' that instinct asserted itself to good purpose , though at times it nearly lost itself among the rub - bish .

		In his latest novel , '' The ' Genius / '' it is quite gone , buried somewhere under the moun - tain of malodorous litter upon which Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	still broods with innocent and earnest devotion as a hen will brood her clutch of pebbles long after you have taken her last egg from her .

		To such futile employment the grosser realistic illusion , which , if Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- man likes , we will call naturalism , may bring even a born story-teller .

		I have said that the great story is purely wrought .

		I mean that it is sound as to sub - stance and well-knit as to structure .

		Only the short tale need be close-knit , and then largely -LRB- as with the play -RRB- for extraneous rea - sons . ''

		Jean-Christophe '' is a great story no more in spite of than because of its many volumes .

		The excellence of ``
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' as a story is in no way compromised either by its length , by its digressions , or by that air of negligence upon which Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	so ingenuously plumes himself .

		When Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling made his famous declaration about the nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays , he was justifiably challenging the critics who wish -LRB- or are supposed to wish -RRB- to tie down artists with petty rules .

		But not one of those ways , however unruly , can afford to be really lawless .

		Even the tribe has its standards , or at least its touchstones .

		How - ever it vary in size or pattern > in color or texture or stitch , our good story is a web well knitted , and not a chance jumbling of parti - colored threads .

		Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's stitch is singularly intricate , but there is no doubt about the firmness of his fabric .

		Even Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	but the interests of neutral - ity now urge that we be chary of attempting to reduce that expansive Briton to a nutshell .

		And if an immense variety of pattern and weft is available for the true story-teller , there is not less surely a vast choice of mate - rials .

		The simpler and more primitive -LRB- but not on that account despicable -RRB- forms of yarn or tale deal naturally with incident and type rather than with sustained action and the development of character .

		`` We have a right 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	to insist , in a general way , that the longer the story , the longer we are asked by the story - teller to associate with his persons , the more justified we shall be in expecting them to find that they are real beings , and not mere types or mouthpieces ; that the action shall be inter - esting because it has to do with them in - stead of their being simply puppets necessary for its carrying on .

		To be sure , a puppet is an admirable thing in a puppet-show ; and a puppet-show , or its written equivalent , is a pure if rudimentary vehicle for the story - teller .

		The exasperating and maddening thing is the sort of fiction , or figment , in which mere puppets are connected with an action demand - ing real characters .

		I suppose more long nar - ratives are offered us , year in and year out , which deserve to be condemned on this ground than on any other .

		Sham characterization is a chief mark of what Mr.
Wister	PERSON	has called the '' quack-novel '' ; and a disheartening fact it is that so many of our confirmed story - readers though not , I am sure , most of them are satisfied to accept , under the well-sounding label of `` fiction , '' these empty travesties of human action and character .

		As for the rest of us which means .

		I am happy to believe , the great majority if we could get rid of the muddle of terms , and stop harping upon differences of taste as to unes - sentials , should we not find ourselves pretty comfortably agreed as to what we really ask of our writers of prose narrative ?

		We ask , I suggest , such a handling of sturdy fact or creative fancy as shall illumine some aspect of human truth of the truth that is truer than either fact or fiction .

		To such a narra - tive , however colored by personal observation , thought , or imagination , I like to think the fine old word `` story '' may be fitly awarded as a symbol of merit .

		CAPRICES OF THE RARE BOOK COLLECTOR .

		A NEW STUDY OF OSCAR WILDE .

		SIR
SIDNEY LEE	PERSON	'S '' LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE '' IN A NEW EDI - TION .

		THE LATE
STEPHEN PHILLIPS	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is a noticeable thing that though pub - lishing has been so badly hit by the war and the ordinary second-hand book trade has also suffered , the prices fetched by old and rare books at the great auctions have been well maintained , and in some cases have beaten records .

		At first sight puzzling , this fact is not inexplicable .

		Persons wdth modest in - comes , on wiiom , by virtue of their numbers , the book-trade in the larger and more popu - lar sense must depend , are feeling the eco - nomic pinch , and are , for the most part , inclined to think of books as dispensable luxu - ries .

		But the collectors of rare books are a small and peculiar class .

		In the first place , they are normally well-to-do , and still have money to play with in spite of the present raids on their pockets and appeals to their patriotism .

		And in the second place , they are such slaves to their hobby that they would go on buying as long as they had a penny left .

		To what the passion can lead a man is shown in the late
George Gissing	PERSON	's `` Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	. ''

		Gissing in his early days , when he lived in a garret and read JEschylus , used often to have to consider the question of book versus meal .

		Standing be - fore a beautiful old volume in a shop-window , he would poise his last sixpence in his hand and wonder whether to do without the book or go without his dinner .

		The book always won ; for , he argued , if he bought the book he would have it a week afterwards , but on sont les diners d' ant an ?

		Had he been more prosper - ous , no such trifles as Armageddon would have restricted his bids at auctions when first editions of North 's '' Plutarch '' or Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	came up .

		That is what the book - collector is like .

		And beyond this , there is of course the influence of the American pur - chaser .

		American competition is the factor that has sent the prices of books , as of pic - tures , up so enormously in recent years ; and that factor is still operative .

		Americans ap - pear to be buying more freely than ever ; we may be said , in a sense , to be bartering Folios for Munitions of War .

		The more valuable the book the more American competition for it becomes operative .

		I was talking on the subject a day or two ago to one of the best
London	LOCATION	dealers in incunabula and other rare books .

		He spoke of the large American purchases ; at the same time he complained that American buying was unsystematic and capricious .

		He could never make sure , he said , what he would place in
America	LOCATION	; few Americans appeared to spe - cialize in a particular type or period of book .

		Possibly this is true ; I know nothing about it .

		But one may say of collectors all the world over that one can not quite make out why they collect what they do collect , and why they do not collect what they do not col - lect .

		With first editions of famous authors
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL the case is fairly clear : the forces of intrinsic interest , rarety , and age produce a compre - hensible resultant .

		`` What I am thinking of , rather , are books which are collected solely , or principally , because they are early or very rare , or because of the beauty of their print .

		With the earliest books of all .

		date is .

		perhaps not unreasonably , the most important factor .

		But it is impossible to account on any ground of reason for the habits of collectors who pro- fess to specialize in beautiful books .

		Fashion seems to govern them completely .

		They get hold of the idea of
Aldines	LOCATION	; they rush for Aldines .

		But
Aldus Manutius	ORGANIZATION	was not every - body ; and , though
Aldines	PERSON	are often beautiful books , there are others .

		Why should Elze - virs have had their vogue , and books printed at
Basel	LOCATION	-LRB- save for a few Erasmuses -RRB- be given the go-by ?

		I have bought recently two most glorious
Basel	LOCATION	folios .

		Erasmus 's
Annota	LOCATION	- tions to the New Testament -LRB- printed by Fro - ben with marginal cuts by
Holbein	PERSON	-RRB- and
Polydore Virgil	PERSON	's History of
England	LOCATION	.

		for a few shillings a piece .

		Why do so few people -LRB- though a number of Germans have begun specializing in this field -RRB- intelligently collect the beautiful Italian books of 1500-1530 ?

		Why are French printers like
Stephanus	PERSON	so neglected ?

		Why .

		indeed , do not the biblio - philes pay some attention to our few good English printers ?

		Some years ago a man wrote a book about
John Baskerville	PERSON	, the eighteenth century
Birmingham	LOCATION	and Cam - bridge printer , who used beautiful type and -LRB- almost as important -RRB- paper which has kept white .

		The result was a sudden rush for Baskervilles .

		But why not collect the books of his predecessor ,
Jacob Tonson	PERSON	.

		who not only printed well but usually illustrated his books with most entertaining engravings ?

		Tonsons are .

		of course , common .

		You can find them in every shop : you can buy for example , his great '' Prior '' or his admirable `` Lucretius '' for five shillings or seven-and - six .

		But if all who profess to care for digni - fied book-production began to collect Tonsons it would soon be found that the supply of good copies of his volumes is not inexhausti - ble , and prices would certainly not remain at their present level .

		Foulis of
Glasgow	LOCATION	is another eighteenth century printer who de - serves the honor of being collected : his small classics are charming little books .

		But I suppose that if I persist in this sort of propaganda .

		I shall end by raising prices against myself !

		Recent books worth mentioning though some of them at least , .

		will certainly have been published on your side are Sir Ed - ward
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's monograph on
Delane	PERSON	, the
Victo	PERSON	- rian editor of `` The Times . ''

		J. 11 .

		Hone 's monograph on
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	-LRB- much more sensi - ble and full of matter than most books on contemporary authors -RRB- ,
Boyd Cable	ORGANIZATION	's `` Be - tween the Lines '' -LRB- about the best book of war - sketches yet published -RRB- ,
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	's '' The Crimes of
England	LOCATION	, '' the seventh edi - tion of Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's `` Life of Shake - speare , '' and
R. H. Sherard	PERSON	's `` The Real Oscar Wilde . ''

		Wilde 's friends appear to think this last subject inexhaustible : the British Museum authorities will soon have to build a new wing to house the mounds of monographs on
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	that every year pro- duces .

		The latest , as these books go , is a good one .

		It is quite uncritical , and scarcely dis - tinguished in point of style : but the per - sonality of the hero comes through , and many of the anecdotes are new .

		It contains one great gem , for which not Wilde but Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	is responsible .

		Contemplating the enormous reverence that they have for
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	, Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	suddenly wonders what would have happened had Oscar still been alive .

		Surely , he asks , had
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's eye been upon them the Germans would never have risked his disapproval by committing the excesses of
Lou	PERSON	vain and
Rheims	LOCATION	?

		Xo !

		the prospect of reproaches from such a quarter would have checked and chilled them !

		It only remained to argue further that a word from
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	would have stopped the war .

		But this step Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	leaves to his reader .

		As for Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's book , what can one do but stand before it with that measure of humility and awe with which a pigmy tour - ist contemplates the uptowering mass of the Pyramid of
Cheops	LOCATION	?

		For seventeen years Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has been adding and adding to it .

		incorporating every new fact which can con - ceivably be brought into relation with Shake - speare 's life or work , until now we have something which is less a book than a public monument .

		It would be possible to burlesque the kind of research in which he disports him - self .

		Group after group of people ,
Strat	PERSON	- ford tradesmen , lawyers , authors , publishers , and peers .

		have been , in the process of years , brought into use in the effort to build up a hypothetical life for the
Elusive Bard	ORGANIZATION	, until one feels that , by the time ten more years have passed , the index of the then cur - rent edition of Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's '' Life '' may pro- vide a complete census of the inhabitants of
England	LOCATION	in the reigns of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
James I. Almost	PERSON	any contemporary docu - ment may be made to have its bearing .

		If , in
1575	DATE	,
Anthony Jones	PERSON	of
Stratford	LOCATION	sold a dozen herrings to
Peter Piper	PERSON	of the same town for two shillings nine pence , the fact s THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	may well illuminate something in the elabo - rate argument ; and , after all , every man then living was or was not Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	, and every woman was either dark or fair .

		But it is a change to come to a great mass of hard facts , however trivial , after the deluge of `` aesthetic '' appreciation of Shakespeare , and the endless attempts to deduce `` The Man '' -LRB- failing any more trustworthy sources ! -RRB-

		from his Works .

		Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	makes no bones about his own proclivities .

		He is a '' dryas - dust , '' and proud of it , a thorough and painstaking and extraordinarily sensible dry - asdust .

		The result is that he is anything but dry .

		His judgments on controversial points are always worth having , though , like all Shakespearean controversialists , he tends to think that 1 probability - f 1 probability = 1 certainty .

		But his accumulation of facts is so enormous and his detail so precise that his book would be fascinating reading even if one took no particular interest in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	at all and did not care whether or not he was
Bacon	PERSON	.

		As a work of reference concerning
Shakespeareana	ORGANIZATION	, this book with its appendices has no rival ; it even provides one with bibli - ographies of all the more important aspects of the
Shakespeare Question	ORGANIZATION	.

		I observe I had not observed it before that by a tragic coincidence one of the witnesses to Shake - speare 's Last Will and Testament bore the surname of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		I also had not realized before that the German taste for `` Unser Shaxpur '' developed very early .

		Two of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , in a very mutilated form , were published in a German translation in
1620	DATE	, only four years after the dramatist 's death .

		The death of
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	would have been much more widely noticed ten years ago .

		From
1899	DATE	to
1905	DATE	, when his early poems and dramas ``
Marpessa	LOCATION	, '' `` Christ in Hades , '' `` Herod , '' `` Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	, '' and so on were being published , all but the most level - headed critics were raving about his genius .

		He was , they said , another
Webster	PERSON	, another
Wordsworth	PERSON	, another
Milton	PERSON	, even another Shakespeare .

		In sober truth , he was a man of sensibility , with a liking for words and a knowledge of the stage , who had nothing new to say and no new way in which to say it .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NEW JUSTIFICATION OF THE NOVEL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY is offered by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		We are all familiar with the prominently dis - played bargain in the shop window , a display that is hoped to win custom for other goods also in the same emporium .

		Apparently with this in mind Mr.
Moses	PERSON	writes , in the course of his article , '' In Defence of Novels , '' as fol - lows : `` Let us suppose that Mr.
Tax Payer	PERSON	had had his way that the buying of novels had been ruled out of the public libraries sys - tem , what would have happened ?

		One of two things : either there would have been a greater buying of novels among the people , thus en - couraging the output of fiction , or there would have sprung up a greater number of fiction libraries than there are , run strictly on a com - mercial basis .

		The public library would have found itself , therefore , working against a sys - tem which was reaping benefit through its neglect , and which was counteracting the pub - lic library 's source of influence by keeping away from it a great many people who , unless it had novels to offer , would never go in .

		Most libraries look to the novel as a means of exploiting other books . ''

		It is undoubtedly true that such a novel as Erckmann-Chatrian 's '' Conscript '' has prompted many a reader to make a serious study of the Napoleonic wars , and other romances have suggested other branches of research ; but it is questionable whether '' most libraries '' -LRB- which may be taken to mean most librarians -RRB- consciously maintain that commercial attitude toward their fiction department which seems to be indicated in the foregoing .

		Novels have their own independent virtues , as do other books ; like beauty they may be their own excuse for being ... SOME IRRATIONALITIES OF THE PRINTED PAGE , minor departures from that correctness in detail which every author and every printer ought to strive for , are brought to mind upon reading , with considerable entertainment and hearty approval , Mr.
Charles Fitzhugh Tal	PERSON	- man 's amusing ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article , `` Accents Wild . ''

		Though the writer claims for himself uniqueness in his irritation at the carelessness with which accents and umlauts and similar
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 9 diacritical marks are commonly used , many another observer must have noted with the same vexation this lack of scholarly accuracy .

		What accents are used in foreign words , and where they are placed , seems to be regarded as a matter of indifference , with an easy as - sumption that the more we have , the better ; some at least are likely to land in the right place if we throw them in with sufficiently lavish hand .

		A very carefully edited
New York	LOCATION	newspaper persisted for some time in recording the military movements of one Gen - eral
Joffre	PERSON	, which was not unpardonable , though a little surprising .

		In one of the most popular of current war books , Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's `` My Year of the Great War , '' he writes , in referring to the
Kaiser	PERSON	and
Berlin	LOCATION	: '' Not far away one had glimpses of the white statues of My Ancestors of the
Sieges Alice	PERSON	, or avenue of victory , '' and he so likes the look of this impossible thoroughfare that he intro - duces it again on the next page , and still again on the one following , although he is j describing an actual sojourn in the German j capital and must have seen in print the word '' Siegesallee '' more than once .

		But there \ is a French word `` siege '' -LRB- which has nothing to do with '' victory '' -RRB- and there is a French !

		word '' allee '' ; therefore he thinks to improve on the
Kaiser	PERSON	's German by making the
august	DATE	Hohenzollerns adorn the `` Sieges Allee . ''

		An j irrationality of a different sort reveals itself ' in the following current news item , the news - paper , however , being blameless : `` Five thou - sand cards mailed from the
White House	ORGANIZATION	last evening read as follows : ' Mr.
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	and Mrs.
Norman Gait	PERSON	, nee
Edith Boiling	PERSON	, announce their marriage , ' '' etc. .

		Most of us , not so fortunate as to be presidents ' brides , have to wait until after birth , some - times a whole week , or even longer , before j acquiring a prefix to our patronymic .

		CRIMINAL SHEDDING OF INK , advocacy through the printing press of doctrines or policies fraught with evil , may be less horrible than criminal bloodshed , or on the other hand it may be worse than any single act of vio - lence if it incites masses of men to excesses of brutality .

		The number of pens in this country at present engaged in urging the necessity of immediate preparation for war -LRB- though they may call it simply armed de - fence -RRB- is beyond counting ; and this frenzied activity illustrates , apart from all questions of ethics or of expediency , that habit of false and hasty reasoning which
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	found typified in the involuntary impulse that makes an onlooker bestir himself to jerk IL i. into an upright position the man who has slipped and fallen , and who needs at the mo - ment nothing so much as to be left for a brief space to catch his breath and rally his powers .

		An instant 's reflection ought to make clear , whatever one 's attitude toward war in general , that now , when a large part of the world is rapidly bleeding to death , or to exhaustion , the danger of attack upon this country is reduced to a minimum ; and that now , of all times , is the proper season to cher - ish some reasonable expectation of success in the age-long endeavor to devise a practicable substitute for war as a means of settling inter - national disputes .

		Let us at least wait and see whether some league to enforce peace may not take promising shape when the battle - smoke at present filling the air shall have cleared away .

		On higher grounds than mere expediency and common sense there is of course much to urge against what the panic - mongers call `` preparedness . ''

		Never before has there been offered so fine an opportunity to show the world that our traditional policy in things military comes near to being the one right policy to pursue .

		Never before has this country had such a chance or been so well able to assume leadership in a worthy cause .

		But here is no place for detailed argument or for indulgence in long-winded moralizing .

		Let it suffice to quote the words of
Isaac Dis	PERSON	- raeli , written a century ago , but never so applicable as now : `` War has corrupted the morals of the people , and has occasioned them to form horrible ideas of virtue . ''

		THE INADEQUACY OP TRANSLATIONS , 6V6U the best , is undeniable .

		Consequently one is not prepared to criticize as altogether extravagant the language of a writer in '' The Unpopular Review '' who , discussing '' The Way of the Translator , '' goes so far as to assert that '' the translation of literature is a meddling an irreverence , a sacrilege .

		It is this because it is impossible , and it is impossible because it is this . ''

		Again , in the same strain , he says : '' Literature is art , and art is emotion .

		Emo - tion is inspiration , a divine thing , the most delicate and the most sacred in human ex - istence ... Translation is meddling with in - spiration , blasphemy against the Holy Ghost . ''

		He is also moved to exclaim : '' The older generation may thank God for bringing them into the world in time to go to college before every housetop in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	became a pulpit for some sophomore or state legislator preach - ing in bad grammar the glories of the superfi - cial and the shameful waste of the deep things of God . ''

		Impassioned eloquence we have 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	here , surely , and if it turns but a single reader to the serious study of one great work of foreign literature in the original , it will not have been wasted .

		At the same time , even though oranges and figs ought to be eaten ripe from the tree if one would get their full flavor , it would be absurd for us of a colder clime to deny ourselves oranges and figs altogether .

		To be consistent , moreover , the writer should have called it an irrever - ence to attempt to read in the original any work not written in one 's mother tongue ; for only the native Italian can fully understand and enjoy his
Dante	PERSON	and his Petrarch , only the Spaniard can thoroughly appreciate Cer - vantes and
Calderon	PERSON	.

		Translations , except of scientific treatises , business letters , or other technical matter , are always inadequate ; yet they have their uses and sometimes their very conspicuous virtues .

		What would English literature -LRB- to push speculation no further -RRB- be like to-day if all English writers had been obliged to go to the Hebrew and Greek for their knowledge of the Bible , or forego such knowledge entirely ?

		FROM AN OLD SCHOOLBOY , a graduate of the same preparatory academy as the present writer , these few sentences from a letter ad - dressed to the school principal offer them - selves for quotation : '' Somehow tag-ends of memories bob up unexpectedly .

		Yesterday I was trying to translate , with the aid of a dictionary , a French official war communique , when some French word suddenly called up the picture of Mr.
Davis	PERSON	sitting back in his chair before his class and making an alien language fairly live .

		His knack of making boys think in French and read their texts through French eyes was marvellous .

		Any - one who has heard him illuminate and vivify ' 1 ` Abbe Constantin ' by the little phrases and remarks he drops out in passing , can not escape without having learned much more of French than is in the textbooks .

		Is Mr.
Hecker	PERSON	still at
Roxbury	LOCATION	?

		I hope so .

		Although I have worked in about fifteen different cities since I left school , and have left a part of my per - sonal effects in each one , I still have in my trunk the card index of Latin idioms with which he used to make sight translation of
Cicero	LOCATION	mere child 's play .

		I shall never forget how he hammered those idioms into our heads , one by one , and then drove each idiom home with a final witty remark .

		After we had learned those few-score idioms , reading Cicero at sight was much easier than reading the war news of to-day . ''

		No doubt
Cicero	PERSON	, accom - plished rhetorician though he was , stuck closer to the truth than the present-day writer of war dispatches , even official ones .

		The whole letter of which a small part is here given prompts one to quote , for the benefit of schoolboys now groaning under what may seem to them an unbearable linguistic grind , the Virgilian tag , '' Forsan et hsec olim memi - nisse juvabit . ''

		But what can those words mean to the schoolboy until long after he has left school ?

		... THE LITERARY OUTLOOK FOR THE SOUTH pre - sents itself to that loyal Southerner .

		Professor
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, as highly promising .

		Hisi Phi Beta Kappa address at
Tulane Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity last
June	DATE	has been printed in pam - phlet form , and no Southerner can read it without rejoicing in his birthright , no North - erner without some momentary regret at hav - ing been born north of
Mason	PERSON	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line .

		Although , as Professor
Henderson	PERSON	ad - mits , the
Hall of Fame on University Heights	ORGANIZATION	has but one of its fifty-one tablets devoted to a distinctively literary genius of the South
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	-LRB- and he was born in
Boston	LOCATION	, of English parentage -RRB- appreciation of good literature and a fondness for the classics were early developed in the southern States , though the call to authorship failed to make itself heard there long after the North had pro- duced writers of more than local repute .

		But with the South again resuming something of its old political leadership a quickening of other activities , including the writing of books , is looked for . ''

		To-day , as we stand upon the threshold of this new era , '' declares the Phi Beta Kappa orator , '' there must come to all of us a sense of joyous elation , a leaping of the blood , that it is given to us to live in such a country . ''

		Surely , in that spirit , if in any , is high-hearted literature produced .

		A PROSPECTIVE SERIES OF IMPORTANT ARTI - CLES is announced by the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin . ' '

		Believing that a lively interest in American public libraries exists throughout the library profession , together with a very prevalent ignorance on the same subject , the editors of the '' Bulletin '' are planning a suc - cession of ten papers from experts , to be published in its columns during the present year , dealing with leading American libraries .

		First , Mr.
Walter M. Smith	PERSON	, librarian at Wis - consin
University	ORGANIZATION	, is to enrich the
January	DATE	number with an account of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	libra - ries , including the activities of the library commission , the university library , the his - torical library , the college , normal school , and public library , as they are to-day performing their several functions in that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chi - cago libraries will next be handled by Miss

Louise B. Krause	PERSON	and
Miss Renee Stern	ORGANIZATION	, after which will come an article on
Greater New York	LOCATION	libraries by Miss
Josephine A. Rath	PERSON	- bone .

		The author of '' The American Public Library , '' Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	's well-known librarian , has promised to write about `` American Public Libraries Which We Should Know . ''

		After this series it is hoped to offer a second on the more important libra - ries of other countries .

		BOOKS THAT MAY BUN THE BLOCKADE HOW maintained by the all-powerful British navy | against free commerce on the part of her ene - I mies are specified by Sir
Richard Crawford	PERSON	, commercial adviser of the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	, in a communication to the foreign-trade ad - viser of our
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Books in !

		German or other language , from the enemies of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and of a philosophical , scien - tific , technical , or educational character , will j be allowed to pass if destined for universities , colleges , or public bodies .

		Applications for the transmission of such freight should be vouched for , in respect to the good faith of the applicants , by some official authority .

		The
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has volunteered to act as this authority , and applications from those institutions desiring to import books otherwise subject to detention should be sent I to him .

		After satisfying himself of the -RSB- applicant 's good faith , the Librarian of Con - gress will give his official voucher , the appli - j cation will be forwarded to the foreign-trade ; adviser of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, who in turn i will send it to the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at Wash - ington with an unofficial request that a permit for the shipment of the books in question be issued ; and after a sufficient interval the books may actually be received .

		Thus is war a fertile producer of red tape as well as of other negatively valuable things .

		THE EXPLOSION OF A PRETTILY PATHETIC MYTH sends its reverberations from
France	LOCATION	to our shores .

		Mr.
Alvan F. Sanborn	PERSON	writes from
Paris	LOCATION	to the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' that the late
Henri Fabre	PERSON	, variously known as the insects ' Homer , the Lucretius of
Provence	LOCATION	, and -LRB- with gentle humor -RRB- the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	of the bugs , was very far from being desti - tute , or anywhere near it , in his latter days , j Prizes in some abundance had been awarded him by the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	and the
Academy j of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, and these prizes took the form of ' cash , sometimes to the amount of five thou - sand francs .

		His books , too , developed a ready sale as their author 's fame spread , and his family connections included persons -LRB- such as a councillor of the court of Mines -RRB- who were able and willing to assure him a com - fortable old age .

		Consequently he was no little vexed by the report , spread abroad by a journalist who interpreted his simple mode of life as an evidence of poverty , that the ven - erable naturalist was suffering actual want .

		The display of obtrusive solicitude and vulgar curiosity caused by this and like reports was exceedingly disagreeable to their victim , who resorted to various devices for the avoidance of a hateful publicity .

		After all , there was pathos in his later experiences , but not the pathos of poverty .

		A POREIGNEB 'S TRIBUTE TO OUR LIBRARY SYS - TEM is always gratifying , as tending to prove that not invariably do `` they order this mat - ter better in
France	LOCATION	, '' or even in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Such a testimonial is made public in a
New York	LOCATION	journal , in the form of a letter ad - dressed to its editor in these terms : '' Sir :
May	DATE	I be permitted , as a stranger in a strange land , to offer through the medium of your hospitable columns a word of appreciation of the excellent service furnished by the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	?

		The attaches thereof know me not from
Noah	PERSON	's niece ; yet on more than one occasion have I consulted them , even by telephone , regarding more or less recondite matters .

		Ever have my queries been an - swered with courtesy , with accuracy yea .

		with erudition .

		And it seems but meet that I should herein and hereby offer my acknowl - edgments .

		Emanuel Elzas . ''

		To Europeans , familiar with the deliberation of their own library officials , the American quickness of response must come as a delightful revelation .

		THE HISTORY OF THE FUTURE , if we are to believe Mr.
Edgar R. Harlan	PERSON	, Curator of
Iowa	LOCATION	's
Historical Department	ORGANIZATION	, will be re - corded very largely on cinematograph films .

		Mr.
Harlan	PERSON	is said to have collected already more than fifty thousand feet of such films , on which are photographed local events of im - portance occurring within the last three years ; and these ten miles or more of graphic his - tory are to receive regular additions , so that the
Iowa	LOCATION	schoolboy or schoolgirl of the future will learn the recent history of that state by sitting in front of a screen and keeping his or her eyes open .

		Of course this is no new application of the cinematograph .

		We have all seen some late memorable events , including perhaps battle scenes in
France	LOCATION	or
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, pictured on the screen .

		Other studies besides history surgery , for instance are now ad - vantageously pursued with the aid of moving pictures .

		EYESTBAIN AND LITEEATUEE : AN ILLUS - TEATIVE CASE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		For nearly a score of years I have persistently directed the attention of literary and medical men to the fact that what oculists call eyestrain has two morbid effects upon literature : it paralyzes lit - erary creativeness and morbidizes what is created .

		But it seems that I have labored in vain , at least so far as concerns my most prized literary journal , THE DIAL .

		I have , I judge , shown that a large number of literary men have in the past been afflicted in this way .

		At last , in the case of
John Hay	PERSON	, we had an instance of positive and convinc - ing clearness ; but your reviewer of Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's `` Life and Letters '' -LRB- issue of
November 11 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- not only makes no mention of this striking and pitiful fact , but traces Hay 's '' desertion '' of lit - erature and his unproductivity to his '' mood and not the want of inborn ability . ''

		In order to make clear that the cause of Hay 's literary unproductivity was not due to inethical lapse and want of literary idealism , will you spare me one or two of your pages for some quotations which will show that your reviewer should at least have more than mentioned his biographer 's oft repeated citation of the real cause ?

		At college there are two reasons why such an intellectual and ambitious young man as Hay would illustrate industry and good scholarship .

		How was it ?

		Let us consider these quotations from Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's book : '' He was never seen ' digging , ' or doing any other act or thing that could be construed into hard study . '' ''

		Throughout the autumn and winter , Hay experi - enced that disenchantment with the world , etc. .

		.

		It coincided with one of his periodic fits of melan - cholia . '' ''

		If my health returns I do not question but that I shall work out of these shadows . '' ''

		I can bear but I am sure to die soon . '' ''

		There seems no doubt that he suffered from poor health that winter . ''

		Throughout Hay 's life , and throughout the lives of the great majority of those who read and write a great deal , there are constantly recurring demon - strations that such near use of the eyes produces not only diseases of the eyes , but more decided diseases of the brain , of the general nervous and nutritional systems .

		Witness a few quotations referring to the dozen or more years from the age of thirty-eight to that of fifty .

		Soon after taking up editorial charge of the '' Tribune , '' he writes : '' see with what eyes are left me , and write till the time of the stereotypes comes , '' etc. . ''

		When Hay 's own health was impaired , by night work on
The Tribune	ORGANIZATION	, his abandonment of journalism followed . '' ''

		Loose the fierce band that binds my tired brain ; Give me the melting heart of other years . '' ''

		In life 's high noon Aimless I stand , my promised task undone , And raise my hot eyes to the angry sun , That will go down too soon . '' ''

		During much of his stay in
Vienna	LOCATION	his health had been bad , a reason for his wishing to come home . '' ''

		Serious trouble with his eyes caused him to forego writing for several months .

		He seems to have suf - fered from what later oculists diagnose as eyestrain , which caused headaches , nervous dyspepsia , and de - pression . '' ''

		Health so seriously impaired that the doctor told him he must lie off all
summer	DATE	. '' ''

		At
Schlangenbad	LOCATION	, took the baths and was assured by Dr.
Bauman	PERSON	, who looked him over , that ' there was nothing serious . '

		At Sehwalbaeh , Dr.
Carl Genth	PERSON	examined his eyes , and ' saw no organic trouble what - ever . ' '' ''

		While travelling through
England	LOCATION	and the
Conti	PERSON	- nent , he was more quiet than in
Cleveland	LOCATION	. ''

		For a month or so on his return to
Cleveland	LOCATION	he '' imagined he felt better , '' but '' the other day I had the most ridiculous attack I have ever had I thought I was dead for half an hour .

		The doctor said it was noth - ing at all serious simply the effect of a cold .

		But I feel rickety yet .

		I have been trying my best to get to work again , with very indifferent success . '' ''

		I have only one aspiration in life , to get out of office and stop having the headache . '' ''

		I am still not well , and the doctor tells me not to be worried if I take a month more to get well in . '' ''


Manitou Springs	LOCATION	or
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	became henceforth his chosen resorts for recuperation . '' ''

		I saw some doctors who told me without collusion that if I would stay in
Paris	LOCATION	40 days and take douche baths I would be well .

		They were both great swells and the coincidence of their views rather struck me .

		I remembered also that it took exactly the same time in
Noah	PERSON	's day to cure the world of most of its infirmi - ties by the same method ; and so , like an ass , I gave up , or rather , postponed , my trip to the South and went through my douches , with , of course , no result whatever .

		I went back to my doctors , and reported .

		One said : Better stop your douches !

		Go to
Cannes	LOCATION	and amuse yourself !

		You will soon be all right .

		Forty francs !

		Thank you !

		Goodbye !

		`` The other said : Eh bien !

		Instead of six weeks , take three months of douches .

		Take them in
Cannes	LOCATION	, if you like , or in Nice ; and with that he gave me an entire change of drugs ; forty francs !

		Thank you , bon voyage !

		There was nothing Noachian about three months , so I came away determined to do noth - ing he told me . '' ''

		I have been so inert and lifeless since I came over here -LSB-
Paris	LOCATION	-RSB- that I have not written a letter except on the stimulus of receiving one .

		I have never been so idle in my life .

		It was of set purpose , and I think it has been wholesome . '' ''

		I was still rather miserable and at last went to two doctors ,
W. B.	PERSON	, an American Egyptian , and the famous C. , the same day .

		They both advised the same thing , douche baths , tonics , and bromides . '' ''

		At your age
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	suffered precisely as you do , deep , nervous depression , persistent indigestion and loss of sleep a general disaster and irritation of the entire nervous system .

		His misery seems to have been of the keenest character .

		Yet he lived to be 86 years of age , and the
last 25 years	DATE	of his life were com - paratively healthy and free from pain . '' ''

		Like the fever patient who , on his recovery , finds the morphine habit fixed upon him . '' ''

		I do not know that I have much hope of ever improving my health , but the doctors give me the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 usual futile assurance that I will be better out of
Washington	LOCATION	in the
summer	DATE	time . '' ''

		I had even written a few pages when I was struck with partial blindness .

		I have had numerous doctors at me almost ever since ... hope by taking it easy this
summer	DATE	to be well next
fall	DATE	. '' ''

		My old foe , the headache , is lying in wait for me , !

		but I hope to get free .

		I write with great labor and j difficulty my imagination is all gone a good rid - dance .

		I shall never write easily and fluently again . '' ''

		I found myself breaking down with the nervous fatigue of writing and copying .

		I therefore hired a stenographer .

		It is a great gain . '' ''

		I am sick abed but the Doctor thinks I am gain - ing on him and will be out of his hands this week . '' ''

		I have lost 10 pounds since
June	DATE	.

		I want to get done with this work '' i. e. , the
Lincoln History	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` When Hay was driven to dictation the foe to ; durable writing he further depersonalized his style . '' ''

		There are lots of pretty things in this rickety old planet , if we could only have the enterprise to look for them and the nerves to enjoy them .

		But eheu fugaces I ought to have done my enjoying while the day lasted . '' ''

		I shall work , not because I feel like it , but because I hate it , and because I feel that my time is waning . ''

		From the age of fifty on , as all oculists know , the loss of accommodation , or the progress of presbyopia , causes greater suffering and a greater inability to write and read .

		The following quota - tions bear ample witness : '' 1 am a worthless creature destitute of initiative . ''

		i '' The doctor tells me I have thermal fever , the re - ; suit of the baths . '' ''

		My fool of a doctor has discovered another mortal malady in me , which tickled him very much , and dis - gusted me . '' ''

		I get up with the impression that I will drop to pieces during the day . '' ''

		All I lack is a stomach to eat and drink withal , eyes to see withal . '' ''

		1 am filled to the lips with the amari aliquid of age and infirmities . '' ''

		I feel as though I should not look at anything much longer .

		I am getting a very bad pair of eyes on me . '' ''

		I have developed two or three more mortal dis - eases since I came here and am going to
New York	LOCATION	next week for Vivisection ... There is nothing like being given up by the Doctors .

		It is a certificate of I longevity . '' ''

		His health , never robust , became more and more precarious under the strain -LSB- of routine office work -RSB- .

		More than once he was on the verge of breaking down . ''

		i '' His health did not permit him to return to Wash - ington until
October , 1900	DATE	. '' ''

		My short remnant of life , of little use to my friends , and none to myself . '' ''

		His gradually failing health . '' ''

		His health visibly declined for several months showed such alarming symptoms that his physicians prescribed for him a complete rest from official duties and treatment at Nauheim . '' ''

		I tried to walk
this afternoon	TIME	, but it was tough work .

		By going very slowly and stopping often I was able to cover about a mile but the pain does not pass away as it used .

		It continued all the way home . ''

		He went to take the cure at Xauheim . ''

		All the Doctors tell me I am going to get well but that it will be a matter of some months yet . '' ''

		My doctor is an austere Bavarian , and does not mince matters .

		I asked why Eixey and
Osier	PERSON	never discovered the hole , or rather bump , in my heart .

		He said : ` Perhaps they did not want you to know it ; or perhaps they could not find it .

		There are few men in the world so sure of their affair as I am . ' ''

		It is now known by many oculists , and by more patients , that scientific correction of the defects of shape and function of the eyes of literary work - ers would not only avoid a vast deal of their suffer - ings , but would insure a greater and better literature .

		In none is '' the mood '' at fault , nor '' the want of inborn ability , '' but primarily the unhealth of the eyes , and following this the sick - ness of the nervous and general systems .

		AN INTERESTING BIT OF FOLK POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Folk literature is always attractive , but I have seldom come across a more pleasing bit of it than a Christmastide poem which was given to me orally and which , at least so far as I have been able to ascertain , has never been printed .

		The woman who furnished it to me learned it from her mother nearly half a century ago , and the mother in turn seems to have obtained it in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is evidently one variant of a rather ancient original , as a poem hav - ing similar structure and embodying some of the same images was used by a group of English singers in this country
several years ago	DATE	.

		The latter , I think , has likewise remained unpublished .

		The poem suggests , as will be observed , an English origin .

		The conception of the twelve days of Christmas belongs to northern
Europe	LOCATION	, this being due , of course , to the fact that the period from
Christmas Day	DATE	to the Epiphany in the Christian year was a substitute for a similar period observed in late pagan times in honor of
Odin	PERSON	and
Freyja	LOCATION	.

		The vocabulary of the poem is thoroughly English , as are also the ideas , indicating that the work is not a translation from another Germanic language .

		The origin of the poem , I should say , was in mid - dle or lower class society probably the former rather than among the nobility .

		The line , '' Eleven lords a-leaping , '' shows almost as naive a conception of the aristoc - racy as do the counting-house king and the bread - and-honey-eating queen of the Mother Goose rhyme .

		The other gifts enumerated suggest somewhat the mercantile magnificence of a Renaissance burgher .

		The poem runs as follows : '' On the first day of Christmas My truelove sent to me A beautiful juniper tree . ''

		On the
second day of Christmas	DATE	My truelove sent to me Two turtledoves , Sitting in a beautiful juniper tree . ''

		On the
third day of Christmas	DATE	My truelove sent to me Three French hens .

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-

		WOMEN IN THE BOOKSTOEES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The book-buying season is over for a year .

		Not until another Christmas comes round will the Gen - eral Public , which depends on libraries and avidly devours the cheaper magazines , have any appre - ciable use for .

		the bookstores .

		Meanwhile , let us adjure publishers , booksellers , college women , and all others interested in the survival of the private library and the resuscitation of the book trade , to recall , re-read , and ponder upon Mr.
Earl Barnes	PERSON	's article in the
August	DATE	''
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' entitled '' A New Profession for Women . ''

		The new pro- fession is the ownership and management of book - stores , to be run on a very limited capital , by means of a benevolent `` on sale '' arrangement , made possible by intelligent publishers ' interest in increasing their terminal facilities .

		I have , to be sure , scant faith in the publishers ' seeing with Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	's eye in this matter .

		His main proposal strikes us as a fantastic piece of chivalry to woman , that would soon put all the present book men out of business and leave the matter in a sorrier mess than it is now .

		But the value of women as bookclerks intelligent women , if not college-trained is another matter .

		Incidentally I would suggest to Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	that the best prac - tical training for an educated woman who contem - plates running a bookstore is to help run one .

		The popularization of the woman bookclerk is an innovation I strongly advocate .

		This Christmas I bought part of my books in a country bookstore , where the proprietor 's daughter , a college gradu - ate , is the presiding genius .

		This woman knew what books she had .

		She could furnish intelligent information about what she had not .

		She was acquainted -RRB- with everybody in her town ; and her suggestions to local buyers were valuable and val - ued .

		This woman loves books and people ; she puts her personality into the business of book -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 selling , in a fashion at once typically feminine and essential in a business that can not be taken imper - sonally .

		Her eager , patient , ingenious service made that subsequently furnished by the men in a city store seem capable and willing , but very cold and stodgy , unsuggestive and unenterprising . ''

		Why do n't you have some woman here ? ''

		I asked the proprietor , a man known in the trade for his intelligent and successful management of his business . ''

		Why , I do n't know , '' he returned indifferently . ''

		We had one , one
Christmas	DATE	.

		She disliked climbing the ladder to the upper stock - shelves .

		We never tried another ; it 's contrary to tradition . ''

		Now most book-buyers are women .

		Naturally they will establish closer , more helpful relations with saleswomen than with men .

		Women read more than men ; they are usually defter at '' skimming . ''

		Women are enthusiastic , and enthu - siasm is contagious .

		Therefore we believe that the educated woman 's ability to increase book-buying , by intelligent service in bookstores , is worthy serious consideration from all persons interested in the issue .

		LITERARY HONORS IX
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am not sure , but I think that it was the late Senator
Matt Quay	PERSON	, at any rate it was some old political `` boss , '' who referred disrespectfully , ungrammatically , and even profanely to '' them d d literary fellers . ''

		He meant certain lit - erary men who had taken an active part in politi - cal affairs in opposition to some of his pet schemes or favorite methods of political pull .

		Anyhow , he expressed most vigorously the idea that such men were not worthy of honor or even of respect .

		I am glad , however , to be able to call attention to the fact that , in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' literary fellers '' are considered worthy of the Imperial favor , even of Imperial honor .

		The scholar , whether in politics or out of politics , is one whom '' the king delight - eth to honor . ''

		For example , it may be noted that many coronation honors were conferred upon scholars and educators .

		And a special provision of the Constitution enables the Emperor to ap - point men of erudition to membership in the
House of Peers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among scholars and educators recently honored with decorations by the Emperor , in connection with the Coronation ceremonies , we find Presidents
Amano	PERSON	and

Miss Ume Tsuda	PERSON	, head of a girls ' English normal school ,
Tokyo	LOCATION	; and two or I three other female educators .

		Moreover , such a scientific scholar as Dr.
Takamine	PERSON	, of
New York ; City	LOCATION	, was also honored .

		And , most interesting of all , posthumous honor was conferred upon the late
Koizumi Yakumo	PERSON	, who is no other than
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	!

		Posthumous honors were also ; conferred upon other literary celebrities , or educa - tionalists , like Dr.
Neeshima	PERSON	, founder of the
Doshisha University	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
Obata	PERSON	, a former presi - dent of
Keio University	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
Fukuchi	PERSON	, a well - known journalist and playwright ; Dr.
Nakamura	PERSON	, ; translator of Smiles 's `` Self Help '' ; and other lesser lights of literature .

		Moreover , although the list of peerage honors is not yet published , it is known that Dr.
Yamakawa	PERSON	, President of the Impe - rial
University	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Hozumi	PERSON	, emeritus i law professor of the same university , and author j of works in English on '' Ancestor - Worship , '' will -RSB- be honored with the rank of Baron .

		This is by i no means a complete list ; but it is sufficient to show that , in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' them literary fellers '' are not deemed unworthy of high Imperial honors .

		If republics are proverbially ungrateful , the sin of ingratitude can not be laid at the door of the Empire of

		STILL MORE ABOUT DIPHTHONGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In connection with my letter printed in your issue of
Dec. 9	DATE	, and the reply appended thereto , may I ask your indulgence to say : -LRB- 1 -RRB- That a discussion on the use of ties , or liga - tures , on certain phonetic symbols , to bring out diphthongal characteristics , is not one of phonetic values , no matter how many reams of paper or columns of print Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	may use in try - ing to prove it so .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- That tie alphabet recommended by the Com - mittee of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, for use in dictionaries and reference books , in
Febru	LOCATION	- ary ,
1911	DATE	, is a very different thing from the
Standard Phonetic Alphabet	ORGANIZATION	recommended by the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	and the
Spelling Reform Association	ORGANIZATION	in
July , 1877	DATE	, but Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	ably confuses both .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- That the practise of all the great dictionaries may be ascertained by consulting the keys to the symbols which they use to indicate pronunciation .

		This is to indicate the diphthongs to which I re - ferred by using symbols that show the diphthongal characteristics already mentioned by -LRB- a -RRB- plain let - ters in combination ; -LRB- & . -RRB-

		dots and dashes and curves and curlicues above and below the letters ; -LRB- e -RRB- especially designed , sjinbols or Anglo-Saxon letters , as the edh and thorn .

		Here permit me to say that more than two thousand years ago ,
Seneca	LOCATION	taught that '' Practise is better than precept '' No matter what precepts Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	may draw from the work of Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's assistants , the fact remains that the practise followed by Dr.
Murray	PERSON	was to use symbols which indicate diphthongal characteristics .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- That nowhere in my book do I individually say '' most phoneticists analyze this sound as a com -
16	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-

Rice	PERSON	asserts .

		It is true that the words appear upon page 291 of the book , but there they are quoted from the edition of ''
Webster	PERSON	's
International Dictionary /	ORGANIZATION	' copyrighted
1900	DATE	, and reissued as ''
Webster	PERSON	's Revised Un - abridged Dictionary , '' copyright
1913	DATE	.

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- That in
1791	DATE	,
John Walker	PERSON	started a discus - sion on the meaning of the word diphthong .

		Now , one hundred and twenty-five years later , Mr.
Rice	PERSON	digs the skeleton of this discussion out of its grave and tries , very clumsily , to clothe it with flesh .

		No matter what Mr.
Rice	PERSON	may think this word means , the fact remains that it has been defined by men who know .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- That , although challenged to `` promptly withdraw '' my '' statement that ' one of the mean - ings of the word diphthong is a combination of two consonants in one syllable / '' because Mr.
Rice	PERSON	says '' at least , no such meaning attaches to the word in the
New English	LOCATION	, the New International , the Cen - tury , the Standard , '' and other dictionaries which he tells us '' are all I have had time to consult , '' I most respectfully decline to do so , and rest my case upon the following facts : `` The Standard , ''
1913	DATE	, -LRB- p. 715 , col. 3 -RRB- says : '' diphthong , n. 3 .

		A combination , especially an intimate one , of two consonants in one syllable . ''


Murray	PERSON	's `` New English Dictionary , ''
1897	DATE	, -LRB- vol .

		3 , p. 383 , col. 3 -RRB- says : `` diphthong , sb .

		-LRB- d -RRB- Applied to a combination of two consonants in one syllable -LRB- consonantal diphthong -RSB- , espe - cially ... such intimate unions as those of ch and dg ``
Webster	PERSON	's New International Dictionary , ''
1909	DATE	, -LRB- p. 628 , col. 3 -RRB- , says : `` diphthong , n. 4 .

		A combination of two consonants in one syllable , esp .

		when blending intimately , as ch in chop . ''

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- Pitiful as my position concerning th may seem to Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	, the fact remains that we use the letters t and h in combination to represent two sounds .

		This is one of the points which the
N. E. A. Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Phonetics sought to distin - guish when it recommended the use of ligatured symbols .

		Two hundred and seventy years ago
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, in his '' English Grammar , ' r drew attention to this double use .

		Said he , Th Hath a double and doubtful sound , which must be found out by use of speaking .

		.

		and in this consists the greatest diffi - culty of our alphabet , and true writing . ''

		-LRB- 8 -RRB- That notwithstanding Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's assertion that Dr.
Wm. T. Harris	PERSON	`` was not a phonetician , '' the fact remains that
Harris	PERSON	was teaching phonetics in
St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1858	DATE	, one year before Mr.
Rice	PERSON	was born , and employed a phonetic alphabet in doing so in the public schools of
St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	, when Mr.
Rice	PERSON	was barely out of kilts .

		-LRB- 9 -RRB- That Henry Sweet never wrote any book enti - tled `` A Primer of English Sounds '' and that , therefore , I can scarcely acquaint myself with its '' earlier paragraphs . ''

		-LRB- 10 -RRB- That
Henry Sweet	ORGANIZATION	ceased to be the `` most eminent of living phoneticians in English ''
April	DATE	30,1912 !

		-LRB- 11 -RRB- That Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	is altogether too modest .

		-LRB- 12 -RRB- Finally , that having provided Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	with an argument , I do not feel that I should be further obliged to find him an understanding .

		THE LAST OF THE
BRYANT	PERSON	CONTROVERSY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I do not wish to strain your hospitality by demanding further space in the Bryant contro - versy .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	wanted facts : I gave them , and since he can not controvert them , he takes up two or three of your columns in sarcastic ques - tioning of my motives , ability , etc. .

		That is not my way of conducting a discussion .

		I do not question Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's ability , or his sincerity and disinter - estedness , in his defence of
Bryant	PERSON	.

		But since he will not credit me with , if not ability , at least sin - cerity and disinterestedness , I must request you and your readers to believe that I have been actu - ated in this matter , not by an impious malignity against the `` mighty dead , '' but by certain ideals of my own which even Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	has no right to question .

		The case of
Bryant	PERSON	seems to me not individual but typical .

		As a young poet wrote to me recently : '' I now see that
Bryant	PERSON	is a symbol of everything that we moderns must sweep aside . ''

		-LRB- To forestall Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's rage or laughter over this '' we moderns '' and '' sweep aside , '' I must plead that youth should be allowed a little arro - gance , and that this particular young poet proves his idealism by sacrifices for his art which
Bryant	PERSON	at his age , by Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's admission , did not make . -RRB-

		But if Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	and I have arrived at an impasse about
Bryant	PERSON	, I trust we may be more fortunate on the subject of Mr.
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	's '' plagiarism '' in the
October	DATE	number of '' Poetry . ''

		It happens that I was familiar with the Meredith sonnet whose final line so neatly pointed Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's brief satire .

		As the very point of its use was the fact that it was quoted , it never occurred to me and no doubt I speak also for the poet to risk a delicately humorous situation by attempt - ing to intrude therein anything so obvious as quo - tation marks .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 17 Sooks .

		WITH JOHN Mum rx THE FLOWERS AXD ICE .

		OF To call
John Muir	PERSON	a naturalist is literally exact , but misleading ; to call him a literary man seems grotesque .

		This sane , fundamen - tally normal man defies classification , fitting into none of our artificial categories .

		He did not write for the sake of writing ; the greater part of his rich life remains unrecorded .

		He did not study nature as a scientist , with the principal purpose of adding new records to the accumulations of the past .

		Highly cul - tured , eminently civilized and modern in one sense , he nevertheless regarded the world so naively that he reminds us of some prehistoric being , endowed with every human faculty , but unhindered by custom and tradition .

		In his writings , he constantly describes natural phenomena as the work of God , and with simple pantheism identifies the contemplation of nature with communion with the Almighty .

		It is this directness , this reliance on immedi - ate experience , which gives so much charm to his descriptions , and removes him so far from the professional writer on the one hand , and the ordinary scientific man on the other .

		He rarely quotes other writers ; the great white glaciers and the flowery meadows remind him neither of the classical poets nor of the trans - actions of learned societies ; there is little to come between him and his experiences .

		There is a natural tendency for an ordinary scientific worker , such as the present writer , to feel a certain impatience with
John Muir	PERSON	.

		Notwithstanding all his contributions to our knowledge of the glaciers , and his illuminating descriptions of northern life , he seems to fall short of making and recording a thousand little discoveries which lay ready to his hand .

		Passionately fond of plant life , having a good knowledge of botany , might he not have given us a mass of exact information on the distri - bution of plants in the far north , in regions which few botanists , if any , have visited ?

		Alaska is so vast , there is so much work to be done , and every real contribution is precious .

		Criticism of this sort is really unreasonable , for a man can not be all things at once .

		Muir developed his nature on its strongest side , and we may be more than content that he was able to see so keenly , to love nature so warmly , and to communicate some measure of his emotions to us .

		Less endowed than he .

		respond to the appeal , and in some poor meas - ure attain his freedom to enjoy .

		So far as at present appears , '' Travels in
Alaska	LOCATION	'' is
John Muir	PERSON	s last book ; indeed , he was not able to complete it before his death .

		If other manuscripts exist , the fact seems not to be known .

		The work consists of three parts , one dealing with his first trip , that of
1879	DATE	, the second with the trip of
1880	DATE	, and the third , unfinished , describing the voyage of ;
1890	DATE	.

		The descriptions relate not only to the scenery and wild life , but also to the Indians , I for whom
Muir	PERSON	had the most genuine regard .

		These simple folk are shown to be capable of great degradation , under the influence of !

		whiskey and other products of '' civilization '' ; i but at their best , they may be nothing less than heroic .

		Thus among the Stickeens the doctrine of the atonement , which seems remote and vague to most modern Christians , was : readily accepted as the most natural thing , ; for they understood it as part of their lives .

		j Not many years before there had been a feud between the
Sitkas	PERSON	and the
Stickeens	PERSON	, and a situation arose not wholly unlike that now existing in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A Stickeen chief shouted across the lines that he wished to parley with a
Sitka	LOCATION	chief , and when the latter appeared ; he said : '' My people are hungry .

		They dare not go to the salmon-streams or berry-fields for winter supplies , and if this war goes on much longer most of my people will die of hunger .

		We have fought long enough ; let ; us make peace .

		You brave
Sitka	LOCATION	warriors go home , and we will go home , and we will all set out to dry salmon and berries before it is too late . ''

		The
Sitka	LOCATION	chief replied : `` You may well say let us stop fighting , when you have had the best of it .

		You have killed ten more of my tribe than we have killed of yours .

		Give us ten Stickeen men to balance our blood-account ; then , and not till then , will we i make peace and go home . ''

		`` Very well , '' re - plied the Stickeen chief , '' you know my rank .

		You know that I am worth ten common men and more .

		Take me and make peace . ''

		John ;
Muir	PERSON	adds : '' This noble offer was promptly !

		accepted ; the Stickeen chief stepped forward and was shot down in sight of the fighting bands .

		Peace was thus established , and all made haste to their homes and ordinary work .

		That chief literally gave himself a sacrifice for his people . ''

		It may be that to stop the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean carnage it will be necessary to sacrifice , , not the lives , but the positions or political prestige of certain chiefs ; but no one expects such sacrifices to be made without compulsion .

S. H. Young	PERSON	is the missionary who accompanied
Muir	PERSON	on his first two Alaskan journeys , and who owned the little dog 18 THE DIAL -LSB-

Muir	PERSON	has immortalized .

		He now tells the story from his point of view , and the twice-told tale only gains in interest from repetition .

		Self - revealing as
Muir	PERSON	's own narrative is , we gain something new from another , regarding him objectively .

		Even had there been no
Muir	PERSON	, Dr.
Young	PERSON	's book would have held its own as an excellent con - tribution to the literature of travel .

		Selecting a single quotation , we take his account of the death of Tow-a-att , a chief of the Stickeens : '' The Hootz-noos , maddened by the fiery liquor that bore their name , came to
Wrangell	LOCATION	, and a pre - liminary skirmish led to an attack at daylight of that
winter	DATE	day upon the Stickeen village .

		Old Tow-a-att had stood for peace , and rather than have any bloodshed had offered all his blankets as a peace offering , although in no physical fear him - self ; but when the Hootz-noos , encouraged by the seeming cowardice of the Stickeens , broke into their houses , and the Christianized tribe , provoked beyond endurance , came out with their guns ,
Tow	LOCATION	- a-att came forth armed only with his old carved spear , the emblem of his position as chief , to see if he could not call his tribe back again .

		At my instance , as I stood with my hand on his shoulder , he lifted up his voice to recall his people to their houses , when , in an instant , the volley commenced on both sides , and this Christian man , one of the simplest and grandest souls I ever knew , fell dead at my feet , and the tribe was tumbled back into barbarism ; and the white man , who had taught the Indians the art of making rum , and the white man 's government , which afforded no safeguard against such scenes , were responsible .

Young	PERSON	's book , but none whatever in
Muir	PERSON	's , a lamentable omission .

		of danger signals and wondering what they mean .

		This is a commonplace of the day .

		Emerson foreshadowed it ;
Moody	ORGANIZATION	stated it fairly in ''
Gloucester Moors	LOCATION	. ' '

		In such a strait any book is welcome which promises a chart of the seas , or even a dead-reckoning of the recent course .

		So the reader who likes to consider himself thoughtful will snap up Mr.
Van Wyck Brooks	PERSON	's ''
America	LOCATION	's Coming - of-Age . ''

		At the outset the book is exhilarating .

		The opening chapter on '' ' Highbrow ' and ' Low - brow / '' based on a remote yet visible past , discusses the chasm between the cultured idealist and the man of action , expounds
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	and
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	as determinants of American character , `` in their amazing purity of type , and in the apparent incompatibility of their aims , '' and fetches up with the conclusion that traditional American education has done so little to bridge the gap that the modern university man is forced to choose between futile ideal - ism and the sordidness of commerce .

		With this well generalized and measurably true dilemma before him , the reader , thoroughly interested , looks ahead to find the way out ; but he never gets out , for the remaining chap - ters triumphantly lead up to the Q. E. D. '' there is no escape . ''

		With reference to '' Our Poets , '' over whom he skims in the second chapter , Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	speaks in the habitual American self-dis - paragement which he himself condemns in his concluding pages .

		Emerson ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Hawthorne	PERSON	are imperishable posses - sions ; but they `` have not had the power to move the soul of
America	LOCATION	from the accumula - tion of dollars . ''

		The exertion of such a power would , of course , have been a fine achievement ; but the implication in the in - dictment is that some other men have exerted just this power over some other nations , that
America	LOCATION	has remained ignoble while other peoples have become ennobled .

		It is a low retort , but in reply to the typical Amer - ican comment it is hard not to ask who the fortunate nation is .

		If
Emerson	PERSON	failed in
America	LOCATION	, did Carlyle succeed in
England	LOCATION	, or Nietzsche in
Germany	LOCATION	, or
Taine	LOCATION	or Hugo in
France	LOCATION	?

		It hardly seems so .

		By the time
Walt Whitman	PERSON	has been reached in the third chapter a disqualifying formula has denied all hope to all other Amer - icans . ''

1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 19 alities . ''

		One begins anew to test the neat generalizations , and to think back to preced - ing chapters as apparently Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	did not do .

		So when he finds -LRB- p. 112 -RRB- concerning Whitman that `` in him the hitherto incom - patible extremes of the American tempera - ment were fused , '' the reader recalls that it has already been asserted -LRB- p. 80 -RRB- of
Emerson	LOCATION	that '' the upper and lower levels are fused in him . ''

		and he is surprised to find that
Emer	PERSON	- son has degenerated in thirty-two pages into the inhabitant of a `` fastidiously intellec - tual .

		.

		shadow world . ''

		From this point on , Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	is no longer disturbing ; but he continues to be interesting as the miles gloriosus of the comedy .

		He asserts that the writers of popular novels '' immitigable trash '' could make literature out of American life , even though no one else has finely succeeded .

		He shows his contempt for the clergyman and the professor , but yet greater contempt for the men who have aban - doned teaching and preaching .

		Because Re - form is only a corrective , he turns it to scorn with the dictum that its ideal is the attain - ment of zero .

Emerson	PERSON	's American choice of `` Representative Men , '' but he ap - plauds
Carlyle	PERSON	's group of `` Heroes '' made in
England	LOCATION	.

		He even between dashes denies humor to
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		But he makes his best hit when he lays low the author of '' Inspired Millionaires '' for not being logical .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	should be careful ; he is making hon - est thinking in
America	LOCATION	nearly impossible ; he thinks on three or four levels at once ; he knows nothing about life .

		This is interesting because on reading the earlier chapters it had occurred to us that Mr.
Lee	PERSON	might represent a new and commendably American point of view .

		Then suddenly the sin of Lee is laid bare .

		He is not a Socialist .

		Now we begin to understand why Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	reduces all civilization to three men in a tub , and
America	LOCATION	's coming-of-age to the maudlin inebriety of a youth who is at once celebrating marriage and majority .

		We un - derstand , but we do not approve , for we feel that it would have been franker of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	to declare his thesis instead of exe - cuting a flank movement on civilization by disqualifying all non-Socialists from any title to intellectual respect .

		It is unfortunate that in the end his suc - cession of lyric utterances should be so in - effectual , for he has not only a gift of brilliant speech , but a real though unbridled power of generalization .

		We are reminded , as we blink before his pyrotechnic pages , of the profound utterance of Professor Kittredge whom he would rule out as a detached '' highbrow '' that a roman candle is a brilliant light but a poor thing to go to bed by .

		We are forced to apply to ``
America	LOCATION	's Coming-of-Age '' what its author says of Whitman 's output , that in its latter part it is `` increasingly marred by much pomposity and fatuousness . ''

		Yet this much should be said in valedictory comment on the admirable closing chapter : Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	contends that an intelligent un - derstanding of American life can be acquired only by means of genuine discussion ; that discussion can thrive only where there are real issues ; and that clear issues can be de - fined only when there has been created '' a resisting background '' against which the thinker can project his ideas .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	presents an issue that the constructive lit - erature and philosophy of the `` highbrow '' must be based on a recognition of economic fact , the stamping-ground of the '' lowbrow . ''

		He presents it vigorously enough to arouse opposition .

		If he can go on increasing his audience and his opposition he may pro- mote that conflict of ideas which will educate
America	LOCATION	toward the coming-of-age to which he now looks forward with so little confidence .

		20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	Until the present generation of historians , historical writing was largely dominated by the tradition that history is a branch of lit - erature .

		The older historians of the revolu - tion ,
Thiers	PERSON	,
Michelet	PERSON	,
Lamartine	PERSON	,
Taine	PERSON	, were not scientifically trained specialists , but literary artists whose ambition was to paint a brilliant picture of the revolution as a whole .

		Their knowledge of the sources was limited , their use of them uncritical , and their exposi - tions superficial and untrustworthy .

		Their works attracted the general public , and were extremely popular ; their defects were known only to the few .

		It was the revolt of these few that was to open the path to sound his - torical writing .

		They realized that the busi - ness of the historian was to ascertain the truth concerning man 's social evolution , and that this task of ascertaining and presenting the truth was a thing of such infinite diffi - culty that no human life was long enough to make possible a thorough scholarly investiga - tion of the whole period of the French Revo - lution .

		It became clear to them that a sound synthesis of the whole revolution must rest upon a continuous series of monographs , the work of scholars who aspired to do no more than could be done thoroughly and critically .

		Thus the historical work upon the revolution entered upon a new stage , that of the scien - tific monograph .

		The sound knowledge of the revolution thus acquired soon discredited the older histories , but did not give birth to any new and comprehensive expositions of the revolution as a whole .

		To the uninitiated , historical writing had entered upon a period of anarchy ; the historian appeared to have lost his large vision , and seemed to be inter - ested only in microscopic research .

		This was , of course , not true , and from time to time a new synthesis has been attempted to mark the progress that has been made and to make accessible to the public the results of the spe - cial investigations .

		This is the justification of Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's volume on '' The Revo - lutionary Period in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		It is supposed to be a college text-book , but it is something more than that : it is without doubt the best brief account in the English language of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic period .

		That is not equivalent to saying that it contains the last word on the revolutionary period , and that it will not in time be outgrown as the monographic litera - ture on the period increases ; but what we wish to say is that Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's book , better than any other volume of the same size , acquaints us with the present state of sound historical knowledge on the period he treats .

		It is not primarily the work of a text-book maker .

		For something like a quarter of a century , Professor
Bourne	PERSON	has been a close and critical student of the revolutionary period , and especially of the French phase of it ; a good part of the scientific studies pub - lished in this country on the revolution has come from him .

		He is acquainted not only with the monographic work on the period , but with the sources on which these monographic works rest .

		The general reader , looking for an introduction to the revolutionary period , could find no more trustworthy guide than this volume .

		It was a large canvas that Professor
Bourne	PERSON	undertook to fill , and he has filled it with unusual success .

		The limits of the period are the close of the Seven Years War and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Within this period took place the greatest revolution in European history .

		In twenty-seven chapters , beginning with '' The People and the Old Regime '' and ending with '' The Restoration in
France	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, '' Professor
Bourne	PERSON	describes the state of
Europe	LOCATION	on the eve of the revolution ; the course of the revolution in
France	LOCATION	, with the reconstruction of French institutions ; the struggle between
France	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, with the rise and fall of the Napoleonic empire .

		It is especially his treatment of the changes wrought by the revolution in
France	LOCATION	and in
Europe	LOCATION	that distinguishes Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's volume from its forerunners .

		Chapters like those on `` Revolutionary Reorganization , '' '' The Finances and the Church , '' '' Imperial - ism and Bankruptcy , '' and '' The Continental System , '' revealing as they do the author 's acquaintance with the best monographic work on the topics , are not to be found in other short works on this period .

		The chapters are not only new and fundamentally important , but they are well done .

		We do not mean to imply that the volume as a whole is beyond criticism ; Professor
Bourne	PERSON	himself would be the last to claim that .

		He could not lean on monographic work where such work does not exist ; and when such aid fails , the work of the scholar necessarily becomes superficial .

		It would not be difficult for the specialist to pick flaws in the part of the present work with which he is familiar ; it would be more diffi - cult for him to construct a sounder synthesis of the whole subject than Professor
Bourne	PERSON	has given us .

		One of the best things in the volume is the bibliography , a sufficient proof of Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's wide reading and excellent critical judgment .

		It is not a potpourri of all that has ever been printed on the subject , but a carefully selected list of the best monographs and the most important sources , such a list
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 as could be made only by the trained scholar who has familiarized himself with the litera - ture through long years of study .

		Some titles are missing , but on the whole it is incom - parably the best bibliography on the period of the revolution to be found in any single volume of the same size .

MORROW	PERSON	FLING .

		A PANEGYRIC OF Music .

		* The author of `` Hermaia '' considers music as the ultimate and comprehensive art ; the other arts , architecture , sculpture , painting , and poetry , lead up to music , and find their consummation in it .

		Music is the latest art to appear in the progress of mankind , because it is the most complex , the most intimate , the most embracing .

		Mr.
McAlpin	PERSON	gives to this art the precedence which he believes to be its right , and the major part of his book is de - voted to an explanation of its importance and position .

		This explanation is presented with a completeness and skill that leave little to be desired .

		The point of view which the author holds will be made clear by the following quota - tion : '' ' The man is only half himself ; the other half is his expression . '

		So writes
Emerson	LOCATION	; and , need - less to say , we are here concerned solely with this other half of man .

		And that , moreover , in a very specific sense , since much of his expression is , strictly speaking , not necessarily of the artistic .

		Yet not only man , but nature also , both animate and inanimate , abounds with expression .

		And that too , quite apart from purposes of utility .

		It is beauty for its own sake .

		We conclude , there - fore , that this same initial and divine impulse , which can not but create the beautiful , reappears in man as a spiritual necessity .

		Indeed , he alone , amongst sentient creatures , has built up for him - self a self-contained world of beauty .

		And within this universe of art we shall discover order and arrangement , such as is discoverable in any other department of existence where the principle of development has wrought it up into an indepen - dent activity .

		Thus with man art becomes expres - sion for its own sake . ''

		The '' expression for expression 's sake '' theory of art is diametrically different from the '' art for art 's sake '' theory .

		The empha - sis in the former is placed upon the content ; in the latter it is placed upon the form .

		The former distinctly proceeds upon the assump - tion that all art has something to say ; while the latter is entirely satisfied with outline and color and rhythm for the pure pleasure to be j * HERMAIA .

		found in them .

		The end of art in both cases lies within itself , and utilitarian considera - tions have nothing to do with it .

		In his chapter entitled '' The World of Expression , '' Mr.
McAlpin	PERSON	says : '' Now , where there is expression , it is obvious that there must be something expressed .

		And the man of art , while obedient to the constitutional law of art itself , is free to draw upon entire ex - istence for his subject-material .

		Broadly speak - ing , all reality may become the artistic model for expression ... Now since art , however creative , can not but reflect reality , we shall find reality exercising a reflex influence upon the domain of art itself .

		Thus if we set the world of idealism and realism alongside of each other , we shall be able to read off the features of reality as reflected in the mirror of man 's artistic consciousness .

		But since man is neither more nor less than his own consciousness , we may say that art is the ideal expression of real experience .

		Art , then , may .

		be said to be the reflection of total existence .

		We shall view , therefore , the world of art as one mas - sive , organic unity . ''

		This world of art , the idealization of ex - istence and experience , has its divisions , just as the realistic world of being and life has its divisions .

		These divisions are , of course , coordinate , and the divisions of art corre - spond to those of reality . ''

		The world of art is total reality appearing in the imagination from plastic art , which reflects appearance , to music , which is the ideal reflection of that which underlies appearance .

		And if we consider how creation was built up from the inanimate to the animate , and how the realm of creativeness has been built up from the arts of plasticity to music , the progress from stones to souls in the real world will not appear greater than the progress made from the pictorial art , through poetry , up to the tuneful art , in the ideal world ... Roughly speaking , painting expresses man 's body , poetry his mind , while music is ex - pressive of his soul .

		They are , respectively , the physical , mental , and spiritual arts , material - ism , mentalism , and moralism in the language of beauty . ''

		It will be noted that there is here no men - tion of architecture or sculpture .

		These seem to be excluded from the author 's considera - tion of art as art .

		He nowhere gives what may be regarded as sufficient reason for this remarkable omission .

		In one place he says : '' Now , respecting the above -LSB- the world of art -RSB- , it need hardly be said that we treat of the main outstanding branches of beauty alone , such as automatically allot themselves to the major king - doms of reality , so we shall have nothing 1 to say about either decorative art , or even architecture in this connection .

		Plastic beauty , which , analogous to the manifold in material nature , covers sa wide an area , will be here represented by painting alone . ''

		22 -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	The exclusion of architecture and sculpture from '' a study in comparative aesthetics '' seems scarcely warranted , and appears to result from an over-appreciation of certain theoretical considerations which are , perhaps , susceptible of a larger and more inclusive interpretation .

		Accepting , however , what seems the author 's rather needless circumscription of his theme , we find his triple differentiation of value and importance .

		He confines the plastic arts to painting , and he thus describes the field and function of the pictorial art : `` Painting is , then , universal art in its infancy .

		It deals with the objective , and satisfies the early dawn of the artistic mind with palpable pictura - bility .

		It is , as we have already seen , the first mental act in art .

		First of all the outer world beats on our senses , and is followed by the awak - ening of the inner mind .

		The child attends pri - marily to the visibly external .

		And similarly the painter attends solely to the object , while later on the poet will be seen to think about it .

		The painter only imagines , while the poet both thinks and imagines . ''

		The second stage in the development of universal art , as our author sees it , is poetry . ''

		In passing now from painting to poetry we pass in reality from visible things to invisible thoughts ; from image to imagining and from symbol to sentiment ; from similitude to simile , and from figures to figures of speech .

		Or again , if painting be assthetic perception , then poetry becomes literally aesthetic apperception .

		And in this translation of the beautiful , we are enabled to lay hold of , as material for art , that immeas - urable wealth of suggestion which arises from the artistic apprehension of apparent experience ex - ternal to ourselves .

		Indeed the poet can add his own personal consciousness or maybe his private experience to the artistic material of the painter .

		What , therefore , was merely suggestion in paint - ing , becomes now the actual matter of artistic expression .

		Poetry thus mediates between paint - ing and music : painting is the artistic reproduc - tion of external experience , music the artistic reproduction of internal experience ; poetry the artistic reproduction of both in organic unity . ''

		Music , expressive of the supreme internal experience and ascending to heights which are inaccessible even to poetry in its best estate , is at once the final and all-comprehensive art .

		If it can not idealize nature as painting does , it can give the sentiment of nature with end - less suggestions , as painting can not do ; if it can not give human life in its infinite phases as poetry does , it can give the universal splen - dor in which both nature and man live and move and have their being , as poetry can not . ''

		Music is therefore the expression of our spir - itual consciousness .

		It breaks up at once that social segregation which is the cause of moral dis - cord .

		It reveals ideally the underlying oneness of all spirits .

		It does not speak so much of the per - sonal sense of self which limits and estranges , but rather of the higher impersonal sense of divinity within . ''

		The author 's thesis is maintained through - out his large volume with unflagging vigor and insight .

		The whole realm of the know - able seems to have been put under contribu - tion to furnish arguments and illustrations .

		Music has never received an exposition loftier or more elaborate .

		Fully half the volume is given up to the supreme art , as is but just from Mr.
McAlpin	PERSON	's view .

		The diction almost bewilders in its richness and profusion .

		The reader may not be willing fully to accept the author 's conclusions , for poetry lies very close to most of our hearts .

		Mr.
McAlpin	PERSON	acknowl - edges that poetry spans both the inner and outer spheres ; and he calls the drama , ideal - ized with music , the chief achievement in art .

		But the sweep of the analysis , the movement of the thought , the cumulative force of the argument , bear on irresistibly to the conclu - sion .

		The book is a significant contribution to the subject of which it treats , and musi - cians will find in it justification for their highest claims .

		* A book of unusual interest to the student of comparative literature is Professor
Jaeck	PERSON	's `` Madame de Stael and the Spread of Ger - man Literature . ''

		The author has traced the diffusion of German culture and letters in
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, as well as German influence upon the literatures of , these countries .

		Curiously enough , the book appears just a century after
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	's `` De 1 ` Allemagne , '' in times as war-like as those in which the latter was written .

		To the
France	LOCATION	of
1813	DATE	, decadent in literature and lulled into a sense of superiority by the suc - cess of her arms abroad , the new
Germany	LOCATION	and German literature of `` De I ` Allemagne '' was a revelation .

		Professor
Jaeck	PERSON	's book not merely emphasizes anew the fundamental ideas of '' De I ` Allemagne , '' but also describes the effect of its message upon the world .

		It ought to be of peculiar interest at this time , and in a country where
Germany	LOCATION	is as little understood as it was in the
France	LOCATION	of
1813	DATE	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 23 up successively Mme. de StaeTs revolt against French classicism , her interest in German literature , and the genesis and writing of '' De 1 ` Allemagne . ''

		The chapter on ''
Essen	LOCATION	- tials of German Culture in ` De 1 ` Allemagne '' is possibly the most noteworthy in the book .

		It takes on a special significance when we appreciate that the ideas it embodies were expressed by a Frenchwoman educated in the atmosphere and traditions of French classi - cism .

		Realizing the decadence toward which the intellectual and moral life of
France	LOCATION	was drifting .

		Mme. de Stael became one of the most penetrating and fearless critics of French civilization .

		In `` De la Litterature considered dans ses Rapports avec les Institu - tions sociales . ''

		written as early as
1800	DATE	, she had already pointed out the results of eight - eenth century materialism and rationalism upon the intellectual and social life of her country .

		French literature , in her opinion , was menaced not only by monotony , frigidity , and sterility , but by forces even more to be feared .

		irony and ridicule .

		All sentiments and actions were gauged by these criteria of the fashion ; until love , enthusiasm , relig - ion , every sentiment except selfishness , was undermined .

		In this book , Mme.
de Stael	PERSON	did not hesitate to maintain that such conditions were the result of a false philoso - phy of life .

		At the beginning of the nineteenth century , in the disappointment at the apparent fail - ure of the French Revolution , a feeling that humanity had arrived at a stage of senility was becoming general .

		Searching for the fountain of youth that might rejuvenate European civilization , which was in effect French .

		Mme. de Stael at length discovered it in the poetry and philosophy of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		In the writings of the Germans . ''

		she re - marks in '' De rAllemagne , '' '' we seem to feel a new youth arising . ''

		In order to find the secret of the youthfulness of German litera - ture , she carefully analyses the new German culture which , unknown to the rest of the world , had developed during the eighteenth century and which culminated in a fresh ideal of man and a new attitude toward the world .

		The basic feature of this attitude , and of the German mind in general , is what she calls the latent and forceful enthusiasm of the German Gemiit .

		It is here that the imagi - nation , the idealism , and the religious feeling which characterize German literature and philosophy are rooted .

		With deep psycho - logical insight Mme. de Stael recognized that a rejuvenation of character and culture could come only if enthusiasm , imagination , feeling , morality like those of
Germany	LOCATION	became living forces in the French character .

		As her coun - try 's need was pressing , she considered it her duty as a patriot to show
France	LOCATION	these quali - ties in
Germany	LOCATION	and its culture .

		She thus became not only the first great interpreter of the spirit of the new German culture , but she became also the inaugurator of a new cultural life .

		It is the second part of Professor
Jaeck	PERSON	's book that offers the greatest amount of new material , especially in regard to the history of American literature .

		The author has set herself the task of pointing out how through `` De rAllemagne '' German literature , hith - erto unappreciated because of great tempera - mental differences , became an active force in the world .

		She has assembled as witnesses an imposing number of writers distinguished in their national literatures ,
Gautier	PERSON	, Mns - set ,
Sabatier	PERSON	.

		in
France	LOCATION	;
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	;
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	, Ever - ett ,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Longfellow	LOCATION	, in
America	LOCATION	.

		These and countless others have paid tribute to the inspiration they received from German literature .

		In American literature , particu - larly , from its earliest beginnings to the pres - ent time , scarcely a writer can be found who has not at some period of his career felt the force of the German spirit .

		Bancroft 's words of seventy years ago have lost none of their force : `` It can not be denied that German literature has come to exercise a great influ - ence upon the intellectual character of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope and
America	LOCATION	.

		`` We may lament over this fact or rejoice at it , according to our several points of view , but we can not disguise from ourselves its existence . ''

		It is in recalling this to
America	LOCATION	, in a day when there is a tendency to reject all things German , that Professor
Jaeck	PERSON	has done her greatest service .

		It would be unfortunate , indeed , were we , in the words of
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	, to erect a Chinese wall around American literature in order to pre - vent the penetration of any ideas from with - out .

		As she well said , '' In all countries the hospitality which welcomes foreign thoughts and sentiments brings good fortune to the host ''

Jan. 6	DATE	RECENT POETRY .

		* The most distinguished name on our list of recent verse is that of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	; but the poems are not new , save in their English form , being in fact translations of the con - tents of the early volume called ''
Serres Chaudes	PERSON	, '' it is annoying that Mr.
Miall	PERSON	does not give us its exact date .

		They ante - date , therefore , all but the very earliest of the plays , and carry us back to the days when the beautifully colored but obscurely outlined symbolistic work of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	was winning the attention of the world of letters .

		The `` Hot Houses '' will seem familiar enough to readers of '' The Princess Maleine '' and '' The Seven Princesses , '' even though they may not have seen the poems in French .

		Here is the same stage-setting , of '' flowers without a hue , Lilies that under the moonlight fade , Moonlight over the meadows laid , Fountains far on the sky-line blue ; '' and the same succession of poignantly stirring but wholly mysterious occurrences : `` All the lovely green rushes of the banks are in flames And a boat full of wounded men is tossing in the moonlight !

		All the king 's daughters are out in a boat in the storm !

		And the princesses are dying in a field of hemlock ! ''

		The difference is chiefly that of form , and one is interested to note the effects accom - plished by English versions of the two chief metrical types used by the poet : the `` In Memoriam '' quatrain , and free rhythms which oddly employ the cumulative cata - loguing method of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	for the fragile materials of
Maeterlinck	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Miall	PERSON	's translations leave almost nothing to be de - sired .

		English verse form while avoiding strongly marked rhythms which would be foreign to his material .

		It appears from a remark in the Preface that he is disposed to dislike the '' In Memoriam '' stanza in its iambic form , and to think it improved by an occasional change to trochaic cadences ; and , though I can not share his prejudice , I gladly admit that he has obtained some charming effects by the experiment .

		One example of these is , I think , the best of the lyrical versions in the collection ; it is called `` Heart 's Foliage '' : '' ` Neath the azure crystal bell Of my listless melancholy All my formless sorrows slowly Sink to rest , and all is well ; '' Symbols all , the plants entwine : Water lilies , flowers of pleasure , Palms desirous , slow with leisure , Frigid mosses , pliant vine . ''

		` Mid them all a lily only , Pale and fragile and unbending , Imperceptibly ascending In that place of leafage lonely '' Like a moon the prisoned air Fills with glimmering light wherethro ' Eises to the crystal blue , White and mystical , its prayer . ''

		A second volume of translated verse is by
Lord Curzon	PERSON	, in this case representing a variety of sources .

		The leading poems con - cern the present war , and are from the Bel - gian poet , Cammaerts ; here one is likely to turn first to the dreadful New Year 's Prayer better called a Curse addressed to the German army , which has already been widely reprinted , sometimes under the mistaken im - pression that it was original with the trans - lator .

		I do not find much significance in any of this group of versions ; the style of the noble lord does not lend itself readily to the difficult union of fervor and directness of speech which is demanded for subjects of cur - rent public concern , and his rhythm and rhyme sometimes lead him from the straight and narrow way with unhappy results , as .

		when he renders '' Et que vous erriez eperdus comme des betes '' by '' Fear drive you like brute beasts that squeal . ''

		More agreeable are the miscellaneous transla - tions forming the second part of the volume , which represent the age-long recreation of the cultivated Englishman the rendering of classical beauties in verse of his own tongue .

		Even here there are few specimens which I should not suppose could be paralleled in most of the vicarages of the kingdom .

		Per - haps because of pleasant memories of the ode in other days , I find most appealing Lord

		Once thou art perished and gone , and , high on his stately tribunal ,
Minos	PERSON	has uttered thy doom , Eloquence , goodness , and birth , Torquatus , will not avail thee E'er to return from the tomb . ''

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's new volume is opened by a portrait which gives real joy in its rep - resentation of the robust and whimsical personality of the author .

		For a current En - glish collection , the work of a journalist , it is rather noticeably lacking in matter that con - cerns the war .

		The greater portion is devoted to poems of love , religion , and the social and political themes which inspire Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton 's familiar editorials .

		This last group con - tains some trenchant satire such as one would hopefully look for the best of it worthy of a Dry den or a Canning .

		I have found chief joy in some lines addressed to the Rt. .

		Hon.
Walter Long	PERSON	, though I know nothing what - ever about the Right Honorable gentleman save that he once uttered some words on revolution which drew Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's blade from its scabbard : '' If I were wise and good and rich and strong Fond , impious thought , if I were Walter Long If I eould water sell like molten gold , And make grown people do as they are told , If over private fields and wastes as wide As a Greek city for which heroes died , I owned the houses and the men inside If all this hung on one thin thread of habit , I would not revolutionize a rabbit ! ''

		Walter , be wise !

		avoid the wild and new .

		The Constitution is the game for you .

		Walter , beware !

		scorn not the gathering throng .

		It suffers , yet it may not suffer wrong , It suffers , yet it can not suffer Long ! ''

		But the surprises of the volume , to those who know Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	only as essayist wield - ing humor , satire , and paradox as his hourly weapons , and have not realized the roman - ticism and lyricism that underlie his nature , will be found in the poems on love and relig - ion .

		There is a Marriage Song , for example , in which paradox and hyperbole are satu - rated with passion : '' Why should we reck of hours that rend While we two ride together ?

		The heavens rent from end to end Would be but - windy weather ; The strong stars shaken down in spate Would be a shower of
spring	DATE	.

		And we should list the trump of fate And hear a linnet sing . ''

		Most of the religious lyrics are Christmas carols ; and they take us back to the ardent singing of Crashaw , though touched always with the consciousness of man 's most recent struggles for and against his traditional faiths . ''

		The child that played with moon and sun Is playing with a little hay , '' this is the old conceit of the Catholic lyrists ; but a moment later comes the paradox of the modern Wise Men : '' So very near the Manger lies That we may travel far . ''

		The finest of these carols is called ''
The House of Christmas /	ORGANIZATION	' and I am sorry that I can find space here for only the concluding stanzas : '' This world is wild as an old wives ' tale , And strange the plain things are , The earth is enough and the air is enough For our wonder and our war ; But our rest is as far as the fire-drake swings , And our peace is put in impossible things Where clashed and thundered unthinkable wings Round an incredible star . ''

		To an open house in the evening Home shall men come , To an older place than Eden And a taller town than
Rome	LOCATION	; To the end of the way of the wandering star , To the things that can not be and that are , To the place where God was homeless And all men are at home . ''

		Very different are the religious lyrics of Mr.
William K. Fleming	PERSON	.

		In entering his little volume we pass from the region both of ardent passion and intellectual strife to one of mysticism and of peace .

		His Christmas carol is of the simple joy and faith of child - hood ; his deeper notes of the quiet hopes of the soul seeking its native country .

		Without salient achievement of any kind , his verse is saved from mere obviousness by the dignity of the personality it represents , and by an almost impeccable taste .

		That is , it main - tains the best traditions of the Anglican lyric of the spirit .

		A good example of its capacity to represent at once its writer 's pleasure in the visible and the invisible world is found in the poem called '' Essex in
March	DATE	'' : '' The long , lean hills of
Essex	LOCATION	, and the grey Salt marshes , and a wind that all the day , With chant of thousand tongues , Roared thro ' the high elms on its coastward way . ''

		And in my heart a voice that cried to me : ' O'er thy trim fields of life , immune , unf ree , There peals the Song of songs , Of souls insurgent for their native sea . ' ''

		The same publisher who brings out Mr.
Fleming	PERSON	's verses has initiated a series called `` Little Books of Georgian Verse . ''

		under the editorship of
Miss Gertrude Ford	ORGANIZATION	.

		One may suppose that it is intended in some sense as an answer or antidote to the series issued by 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	the Poetry Bookshop , for it is brought out in similar inexpensive brochures , yet appears to be more conventional and discreet in both form and content ; and Miss Ford lays em - phasis -LRB- in her Introduction -RRB- on a desire to discover poets representing the continuity of the English tradition , the line of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, as distin - guished from `` iconoclasts with studied striv - ings after originality . ''

		To some of us this declaration of principles sounds wholly rea - sonable ; yet of course , in considering how it works out , one is brought face to face again Avith the perennial problem of art , how to represent the sound tradition and at the same time make an individual offering worthy of distinct attention .

		I regret that Miss Ford should not have found verse of more distinc - tive intrinsic significance than that contained in the two opening issues of the series .

		One is by Lieutenant
C. A. Macartney	PERSON	, of the '' New Army , '' and we can not avoid the suspi - cion that we are invited to look on his poems more sympathetically because he is a young hero of the hour ; the other is announced as the work of a girl of sixteen , and again there is an inevitable disposition to judge it as re - markable under tine circumstances .

		In Lieu - tenant
Macartney	ORGANIZATION	's verses I find little that leads me to do more than wish him well .

		The other collection , by Miss
Mona Douglas	PERSON	, is decidedly more interesting .

		The author is a Manx girl , evidently of delicate sensibilities for all the aspects of nature , and with a more than ordinary gift for metrical expression .

		One hopes , of course , that her work will tell us something distinctive of her special en - vironment , and there are bits of
Manx	ORGANIZATION	legend and
Manx	ORGANIZATION	landscape which she has caught up with a true sense of their values ; in general , however , she has been learning from litera - ture rather than life , and this is quite as it should be in her ` prentice days .

		It is as promise and suggestion of more distinctive work hereafter that the little volume is to be valued .

		And perhaps Miss Ford purposes frankly to make use of this new series as seed-plot and testing-ground for poetry which is to be viewed as potentiality rather than achievement ; if so , we can heartily approve it .

		I find the most attractive of the verse thus far given us to be in these stanzas from a lyric in
Miss Douglas	LOCATION	's collection , called `` Moods '' : '' Dawn on the hills , and a breeze across the heather , Lark-songs that fall from the solitudes of blue ; Haze on the bogs with their tufts of golden feather , And a light that makes the whole world new . ''

		Dusk on the hills , and the shadows on the heather , Ripples of flame on the waters far away ; Light on the crags , where the cattle roam together In the glory of the dying day . ''

		For American verse I turn first to the col - lection of Mrs.
McGiffert	PERSON	's poems , opening with `` A Florentine Cycle . ''

		To speak truly , it is a volume of the type which tends danger - ously to tempt the reviewer to shut his eyes to its many points of excellence .

		It is too long , to begin with : it is long without rea - son ; it might as well have been much longer , or more happily half as long ; it im - presses one as containing all that the author has thought of committing to verse day by day for many , many days .

		She has travelled widely , and wherever she has gone a series of admirable quatrains has recorded her impres - sions ; she has studied the history of the regions she has passed through , and been fascinated to find that all the proper names thus turned up can , with a little dexterity , be wrought into her quatrains .

		She has looked on the cherubs of
della Robbia	LOCATION	, on the
Torso Belvedere	LOCATION	, on a silver bowl of
Cellini	ORGANIZATION	's , on an Alsatian village , and for each has had a pleasant thought which she has expressed in what may be truly if tritely called well - chosen words .

		As companion in travel , or correspondent , I should suppose her charm to be rather notable .

		But one seeks almost in vain for the lyrical intensity , the really pene - trating imaginative flash , which alone will justify beyond question the making of so much verse , or no , I do not mean the mak - ing of it , but the printing or the reading of it .

		Mrs.
McGiffert	PERSON	thinks well clearly and firmly , as well as pleasantly , and there are epigrams and sonnets which are admirable for their outline and their definitiveness .

		For example : `` A fleeting rose-bud crave eternal life , With its own loveliness unsatisfied ?

		Is perfume of its passing not enough ?

		Has one least rose-bud ever really died ? ''

		But even this quatrain suggests a notable defect of the writer 's verse , considering that one is driven to look at it so largely from the standpoint of fine formal artistry : her pov - erty of rhymes .

		The greater portion of the collection is in quatrains , and I have not noted a poem in which she completes the rhyme in the odd-numbered lines .

		This is no trifle ; for the whole story of our verse goes to show that , while you may use the imperfect abcb quatrain without harm in a loosely wrought , simple poem in ballad or similar style , if you seek the effect of closely wrought perfection , of cameo , etching , or epigram , you must not leave lines unrhymed as if through the mere negligence of completeness .

		Despite this imperfection of form , I choose as an
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL especially pleasing example of Mrs.
McGif	PERSON	- fert 's imaginative art this bit of interpretive fancy on '' The Brook '' : '' A rush of twisted waters through the glen .

		Eager and valorous it delves and hews ; A
Future City	LOCATION	waits to flower its banks , So it must wisely choose ! ''

		It leaps , it dances on its dainty way ; That spot is for cathedral arch , and there Some day will rise great deathless marble heights , So must it have a care ! ''

		Diametrically opposite in its effect is the collection of poems by Mr.
W. S. Johnson	PERSON	.

		From the standpoint of the purist it is some - thing of a hodge-podge , bits of inspiration from
Whitman	LOCATION	, bits from
Browning	PERSON	, bits of current science and sociology versified with zest but not with unerring taste , a jolly Parisian villanelle and a ballade or two , to - : gether with popular verses that move swiftly and cheaply in Kipling-like journalese .

		But there is the real stuff of poetry here : the : interpretation of vital experiences by an j eager imagination that transfigures them , for ' .

		the moment , to something of widely appealing significance .

		The unity of the volume , so far as it may be found , lies in that type of relig - ious sense which is perhaps of closest kinship to poetry the Spinozistic conception of in - dividual experiences as bubbles on the surface of the divine firmament of waters .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	expresses this most eloquently and at the same time most definitely in the fine harangue of Lachesis in the poem called '' Beyond Our War '' : '' For That which suffers is the Joy of God , Forever widening and quickening ; And That which strives is but the
Peace of God That	ORGANIZATION	passeth understanding .

		As bubbles they rise , The works and wars and wonders of the world ; And in the verity of the crystal sphere They show as worship .

		Mine are the Eyes of Life !

		I see it all and Life is worship only !

		... '' The marble pants with art 's immortal breath ; Ascetic vision hunger-dreams to death ; The clutching talon and the rending claw Act the red ritual of evolving law : And each is worship only '' I see the chestnut glaze its winter bud , Atom slay atom in the fevered blood , An earthworm draw a leaf beneath the sod , A poet love his failure up to God : And each is worship only . ''

		And millions , throbbing with the throbbing drum , Hear the Great Call ; and millions yet to come Shall follow by the charnel road of strife Through hate to love , through passionate death to life : And this is worship only . ''

		I can not here do myself -LRB- and the reader -RRB- the pleasure to represent Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's lighter vein , but commend unreservedly the good - natured satire of the verses on the weather - cock Egoist a kind of new Chanticleer who believes he controls the winds and the dainty humorous philosophy of the address to a sparrow in the
Luxembourg Gardens	LOCATION	.

		The drawback is that the writer either can - not trust his taste or does not care to , and allows compositions to slip into the volume , and lines to slip into compositions , oddities of vocabulary and grotesque violences of imagery , like ''
Yggdrasil	PERSON	's pollen omnific '' and `` This pullulating spawn of man that fouls the rotting earth '' together , as I have said , with some mere journalistic doggerel , all of which will make the judicious grieve .

		Perhaps Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	does not care whether they grieve or not , so long as he says his vigorous say .

		I should add that the '' Prayer for Peace . ''

		which gives title to the volume , is an exposition , in vivid imaginative form , of the notion that strife can not be put away in a universe which is evolving through strife toward perfection .

		For this reason it has already won the approbation of Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt , and may perhaps be made into a tract by the
Navy League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The name of Mr.
Shaemas O'Sheel	PERSON	invites us to look in his verse for a fine Irish zest and irresponsibility in the enjoyment of both beauty and action , and we are not disap - pointed .

		He calls Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	his master , and at times , like him , seeks to catch and imprison the beauty of the '' Rose of the World '' ; but he has not his master 's sureness of ear and of touch , so that his more delicate workman - ship , though not unappealing , can hardly be thought memorable .

		But I have taken real pleasure in a frankly American harvest song of `` Thanksgiving for Our Task , '' and still more in the buoyant rhythm and garrulous feeling of this lyric called `` A Night on the Hill '' : '' Once when the grey night held more of clouds than of stars , And the wind was swift and cold , and full of a troubling cry , I quenched my lamp and opened the door and dropped the bars And went forth into a meadow , past fields of shud - dering rye , And over a moor that ghastly lay under a ghastly sky , And I ran with a stumbling run that the wind might blow more bitter by .

		And I fell in weary delight by an old ash clenched with scars , And I trembled a-thrill with cold , and was content to lie . ''

		And the glory of God 's wild mirth was revealed to me , And I saw how the elements played at a game through space , 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	And the wind was mad with a vast impetuous glee , And a starry laughter broke on the sky 's pale face ; White naked runners in the dark , the clouds a-race , And virginal snowy dancers veiled in lace ; And an ancient laughter roared through the rocking tree , And ripples of youthful joy sang the flowers of that place .

		And I lay like the mossy rock on the side of the hill , And the spin of the rolling world was a dizzy thing , And I heard in a moment , when the winds were sud - denly still , The cheery and lusty song that the huge tongues sing The tongues of flame leagues deep in earth 's hollow - ing ; Far off I knew the great seas leaped in a ring ; And I rose with joy in my heart and peace on my will , And sought the fire on my hearth , and my home 's enfolding wing . ''

		Mr.
Arthur Guiterman	PERSON	has collected in `` The Laughing Muse '' many merry verses which have already been enjoyed in various periodicals .

		Of these the cleverest is that which opens the volume , '' The Quest of the Riband , '' the account , in antique ballad form , of a shopping expedition undertaken by a mere man in a modern department store .

		Since this is quite too long to be represented here , and since our subject is contemporary poetry , I choose for an example of Mr.
Guiter	PERSON	- man 's not wholly thoughtless raillery this account of '' The Young Celtic Poets '' : '' Their hearts are bowed with sorrow , They love to wail and croon ; They shed big tears when they sigh , '
Machree	PERSON	, ' Floods when they sob , ' Aroon ! ' ''

		For the
Young Gaels of Ireland	ORGANIZATION	Are the lads that drive me mad ; For half their words need foot-notes , And half their rhymes are bad . ''

		The admirers of Mr.
Arthur Davison Ficke	PERSON	's poetry , among whom I have often been glad to count myself , are likely to experience some disappointment in reading his latest volume .

		It contains some fine things , notably the Elegy on
Swinburne	LOCATION	, which attracted some attention at the time of its publication in a periodical ; but as a whole it can not be said to mark prog - ress either in the matter or form of the writer 's art .

		T!he two leading poems are in narra - tive blank verse of a kind of Wordsworthian cast , and , while here also there are exceed - ingly good lines , I do not find Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's blank verse sure-footed or persistently effec - tive .

		The title-poem , giving the story of a madman who crucified himself through a pas - sion to save the world , is certainly not unmov - ing , but it must be admitted to be the sort of tale which is legitimately moving only if known to be true , and hence not well fitted for poetic fiction .

		The other narrative , called `` At St. Stephanos , '' disappoints in arriving at no real climax either of action or feeling .

		It depicts a somewhat mysterious monk in a mountain convent , who , after darkly hinting that he had that within him which he could not bring himself to reveal , at length found voice and -LRB- says the poet -RRB- '' Poured forth such speech as from no other man I ever heard , nor like shall hear again . ''

		This promises much ; but all that transpires is that the young monk had led a life which vacillated between the ideal of contemplation and that of action , and that now , being irre - trievably imprisoned in the monastery , he was dying of hopelessness because neither ideal had been fulfilled .

		One must think the poet to have been singularly unfortunate if he had never heard speech more remarkable , both in content and form , than this of Theodoras .

		What he feels that he has gained is a view of '' Man 's life , and its strange pitif ulness ; so sweet That memory makes the heart to overflow : So bitter that men turn from it , as turned This soul beside me , to the world of dreams : So fleeting , that the darkness hovers close Even while the seeker pauses to debate The better path , or turns to mourn in vain A choice regretted , and the days go by Bearing what still remains . ''

		And the languorous and purposeless disillu - sionment of this conclusion seems to animate -LRB- if that is not too vigorous a word -RRB- the great part of Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's volume .

		Sometimes he compares himself , with pride decorously veiled in a sweet sadness , with those who have settled down to a contented theory of life , who `` have determined all that life should be '' ; sometimes he admits to being `` weary of being bitter and weary of being wise '' ; sometimes he forecasts the late autumn when it will only remain for him to '' clasp , with weak and thankful heart .

		Whatever faded blossom there apart Can ease my smart . ''

		All this is skilfully , much of it beautifully , done ; and I am far from assuming that Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	identifies himself with these various wise and bitter and weary and generally dis - illusioned and disillusionizing singers .

		But if he is to give us a collection of dramatic monologues , he should admit among his dramatis persona some of a more heartening sort .

		This I say , foreseeing that it will again be charged as has been done already that I count no poetry first-rate which does not teach sound doctrine ; and I can not here pause to explain how it is that I mean something quite different , apart from doctrine alto - gether .

		But in leaving Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's volume , since I am unwilling to represent the Swin - burne elegy by a few lines only , and since in a review not long ago I quoted one of his
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 admirable sonnets , I shall here set down this slight but hauntingly perfect lyric , called '' The Three Sisters '' : '' Gone are those three , those sisters rare With wonder-lips and eyes ashine .

		One was wise and one was fair .

		And one was mine . ''

		Ye mourners , weave for the sleeping hair Of only two your ivy vine .

		For one was wise and one was fair , But one was mine . ''

		I turn finally to a group of three little vol - umes of posthumous verse , all of distinctively personal character , whose interest and value are in some measure frankly dependent on the personal relation .

		The first is made up of verses written in his latter days by the late Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	bookseller , publisher , and literary amateur , whose per - sonality was familiar to many Americans ; they are brought out for private circulation by his son .

		The theme of these poems is the end of life , and what it means for one to whom eager activity seems the one essential of living , and who feels no assurance that there is to be any continuance of such indi - vidual activity .

		Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's spirit was Stoic , and his poetic method somewhat coldly ex - pository , yet with a dignity and sincerity which caught something of the attractiveness that lies in the stern and sombre veracity of
Blair	PERSON	's verse , or Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's .

		`` Witness these quatrains , of the eighteenth century not merely in manner but in mode of thought , on the dread of senile decay : '' A ruined castle of all life forlorn ; A temple by a barbarous host profaned ; A
Venice	LOCATION	of its power and glory shorn ; A stony desert where abundance reigned ; '' Such sights as these are sad .

		yet not so sad As 't is to see a noble mind 's decay : A
Marlborough	LOCATION	doting , or a Swift grown mad ; A fiery soul to ashes burnt away . ''

		Strike me down rather in the flush of life .

		When hopes are high and every prospect fair ; The soldier slain in the fierce battle-strife Buys cheaply his release from pain and care . ''

		It happens that the next collection , made of the posthumous poems of
Clifford Lanier	PERSON	, fur - nishes a strikingly contrasting treatment of the same theme of old age .

		viewed now by one who is both romanticist and man of faith : '' Gold in the morn ; silver shine at noon ; Gold after noon : new soft lights beam , Whereof the heart of youth may merely dream :
Pearl	LOCATION	, amber , lucent sard are in yon gleam .

		In circles ever moveth life around .

		Without decline ; eve puts no term nor bound ; Age at old portals is await For that new scene beyond the gate .

		This little grain of life was sweet : how grand The planetary round of God 's new land ! ''

		For these poems Mr.
Edward Howard Griggs	PERSON	writes a brief memorial introduction , with an account of the friendship of the brothers
Sid	PERSON	- ney and
Clifford Lanier	PERSON	, and the sacrifice which the younger made for the older and more gifted , in yielding up his own hopes of a life devoted to letters .

		The opening sequence of sonnets is the monument to this friendship , of uneven excellence , wrought always with love and sometimes with skill .

		The finest of the sonnets , beginning , '' Thou magic breather of the silver flute , '' which reproduces rather remarkably the Elizabethan flavor , has already won friends through periodical publication .

		Professor
George Herbert Palmer	PERSON	has now followed up his notable memoir of his wife , after more than seven years , with a collection of the verses found in her desk .

		The greater portion of them were planned , he tells us .

		as parts of a `` Marriage Cycle '' ; and he has sought to arrange and entitle them with a view to their place in this plan .

		The result is bound to impress us not so much as a work of art as a new view of the rich personality which was revealed and interpreted in one of the most remarkable of American biographies .

		The theme of the series of poems is best stated in Professor
Palmer	PERSON	's own words , as `` the significance of marriage , blended as it always was in her mind with religious expe - rience and the enjoyment of nature '' : and its primary value lies in the veracious repre - sentation of this triune devotion .

		It can not be claimed that the greater number of the poems would be certain to seem distinguished , apart from our knowledge of the writer ; for
Alice Freeman Palmer	PERSON	did not have precisely the mind or the pen of an artist .

		She touched and expressed life with directness , rather than with imaginative interpretiveness if there be such a word .

		Yet this is only a question of degree ; and there are compositions in this volume which beautifully show '' emotion recollected in tranquillity '' and committed to enduring form .

		Choice is difficult , but these stanzas from the poem called '' The Glory of the `` World '' are true to the theme and the mood of the whole sequence : '' O
summer	DATE	night beside the soundless sea , golden hour for my dear Love and me !

		The past , the future , are at one with thee ! ''

		O witching world , with beauty never guessed !

		Light of the east , dead splendors of the west .

		1 lock you fast forever in my breast . ''

		I know your wondrous meaning ; for one stands Beside me , at the touch of whose dear hands My whole heart leaps to life and understands . ''

		30 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	This is the normal simplicity of the writer 's method .

		But now and then she turns to the more elaborate figuring of an experience , as in the perfect allegory of this poem , complete in six lines , whose art is reminiscent of
George Herbert	PERSON	's : '' I said to Pain , ' I will not have thee here !

		The nights are weary and the days are drear In thy hard company . '

		He clasped me close and held me still so long I learned how deep his voice , how sweet his song , How far his eyes can see . ''

		The editor sums up his impression of the chief values of his wife 's verses in a reference to the '' art of transmuting our usual and neces - sary experiences into occasions of wonder , romance , and gladness . ''

		And this is not a bad word on which a critic or a reader of poetry may pause .


RAYMOND M. ALDEN	PERSON	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It is hard to avoid what the publishers say about a book , and the ingenuous mind would ask , Why do so ?

		It would seem as though they ought to know better than most what the author is trying to do .

		In writing of '' Lot & Company , '' the publishers speak of Mr.
Will Levington Comfort	PERSON	as being '' among the best writers of romance and adventure , '' and add : `` Never has Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	written a novel in which is heard so clearly the sound of the sea , man 's love for woman , and the song of the joyous seeker , going on day after day to the wonder of new horizons . ''

		Now if those de - lightful things show the intention of the author , his book sends his readers off on a false track .

		The net impression of `` Lot & Company '' is not that of a tale of romance and adventure , in fact , there is not really very much romance and adventure in it , in the ordinary understanding of those words , but rather of a book in which a man had something very especial to say to the world .

		It is not specifically the story of the joy - ous seeker always coming on new horizons , again as one would normally understand the expression , but the story of a man who was applying himself very definitely to a search for something he was absolutely determined to find .

		There are horizons and adventures , it is true ; but it is a pity to give the idea that they are the great thing , for then the reader will fancy he has a good example of something * LOT & COMPANY .

		which at its best is not one of the finest things of art , instead of an effort -LRB- successful or not -RRB- at one of those aims which have always been the mark of a great man of letters .

		I prefer the other view , even reckoning without Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	himself , if that be neces - sary , and shall assume that he had -LRB- subcon - sciously , if you like -RRB- an idea , and that the power of his idea moulded his conception even of horizons and adventure .

		This idea is that there is a finer life than that of grabbing and getting , making money or at least taking it from others , or perhaps really only noting down in a book that you have done so , scour - ing sea and land to make an addition to the right side of the ledger .

		It may seem that this doctrine is nothing new , which is cer - tainly the case ; still , it is interesting to see the form it will take in the mind of an adven - turer , a joyous seeker of wide-spread wonder of new horizons , a lover of women and the sound of the sea .

		We shall not tell just what form it does take ; that is the story , and we think that in the hand of Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	it makes an impression that will be remembered .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's `` The Star Rover '' `` is also a book founded upon an idea .

		As to just what that idea is , there may be difference of opinion .

		In fact , it may well be thought that Mr.
London	PERSON	bodies forth in his imagination more than one `` fundamental idea . ''

		If we turn once more to the publishers for informa - tion , we shall gather that the plot rests upon the conception of the '' supremacy of mind over body . ''

		This idea is undoubtedly to be found in the book , and may be thought funda - mental , in that the full structure of the book is built upon it , or dominating , in that it controls the development of the story .

		The novel gives the experiences of
Darrell Stand	PERSON	- ing , a man serving a life sentence in the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia
State	ORGANIZATION	prison at
San Quentin	LOCATION	.

		He proved incorrigible , and according to the mode of dealing with incorrigibles in that institution he was given not only solitary con - finement but in addition what was called '' the jacket . ''

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	describes with his ac - customed vigor the horrible conditions which prevailed in the prison and the relentless vigor with which the officials quelled the slightest breaches of discipline .

		Laced in a straight-jacket , then , in solitary confinement ,
Darrell Standing	PERSON	is told that it is possible for one to release the mind from the prison of the body .

		He tries the experiment and succeeds .

		With his first success he vaults beyond prison roof and
California	LOCATION	sky , and is among the stars .

		In the shortest possible time he is away star-roving for long ages .

		Hence the name of
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 31 the book , and hence the view that in such free - dom of mind from body we have this funda - mental idea .

		But all this is but a beginning .

		As time goes on , another thought becomes more prominent .


Darrell Standing	ORGANIZATION	ceases to rove among the stars , but when his spirit leaves the prison of the body it passes into the bodies of other men in whom we feel it had at one time previously lived .

		So he becomes , first , Count Guillaume de Sainte-Maure ; then
Jesse	PERSON	, a boy who goes with the immigrant train which was ambushed by the Mormons at
Mountain Meadow	ORGANIZATION	; then
Adam Strang	PERSON	, who was shipwrecked in
Korea	LOCATION	, the lover and husband of the Lady Om .

		Then he is
Ragnar Lodbrog	PERSON	, the northern legionary in the Roman garrison of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	at the time of Pilate ; then he becomes
Daniel Foss	PERSON	, a native of Elk - ton , who sailed for the
Friendly Islands	ORGANIZATION	and was cast on a desolate island where he lived for many years .

		He becomes Ushu , the pre - historic man who takes for his mate
Igar	ORGANIZATION	, the race mother .

		But always at some crucial time he returns to his `` jacket , '' whence he passes by a natural series of events , until he finds himself finally in the death cell waiting for the day of execution , where he writes the book we read .

		It is this latter idea , the conception of the transmigration of souls , the idea that the living spirit inhabits first one body and then another , sometimes retaining a hazy recollection of earlier phases of existence , that seems to be the dominating conception of the book , rather than the more general notion , which perhaps includes it , of the supremacy of mind over body .

		Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	, in his novel enti - tled `` Athalie , '' has also had thoughts that lie rather deep beneath the somewhat superficial life which the book otherwise portrays .

		A story `` of a girl who was strangely clairvoy - ant , '' the volume is said to be -LRB- again by the publishers -RRB- ; and such it is , for
Athalie Green	PERSON	- sleeve did possess the power which is com - monly called clairvoyance -LRB- whether it really exists or not -RRB- , and indeed was thereby very fortunately enabled to earn her living at a time when she found herself unable to do so in any other way .

		But to speak of the idea of this book as clairvoyance , or of
Athalie	PERSON	as a clairvoyant , gives one a false notion : for really it would seem that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is not so much concerned with the experiences of a girl of marked or singular power as he is with the much greater matter of whether those who have passed out of physical life can and do still remain near the scenes of their former experience and with the persons of those whom they have loved .

		Whether or not a girl be a clairvoyant appears to us rather a minor matter , when compared with the great question we have just noticed ; and Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	seems absorbed in the greater ques - tion rather than the less .

		The general character of Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's ability is so well known that one need not do more than refer to it .

		He is undoubtedly able to present a picture of the gay and glittering , rather external and semi-public , life of
New York	LOCATION	at the present day , the life where home means an apartment , where dinner means a restaurant , where amusement means the theatre , and where business may or may not mean anything at all .

		Doubtless there are phases of existence in any large city more or less like the life which Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	presents .

		I always take the liberty to doubt privately whether there are many young ladies of per - fectly correct and beautiful character who spend their evenings and sometimes their afternoons habitually with some high minded and fine natured young man of wealth and position without a thought of anything be - yond friendship .

		Whether there be such is not important just now ; more to the point is it that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	, having in mind a fine idea and wishing to present it in his own way which is , of course , not the way of the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	or any other such body , has rather unfortunately allowed his idea to be so overlaid with other things that few will get more than a suggestion of what it is .

		It does no injustice to Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- bers to think that he has .

		a deep sympathy , if not perhaps a settled belief , in the thought which here and there rises in his pages .

		We must rather regret that he allows his unde - niable gift for the gay , the light , the spark - ling forms of existence to fill the mind so that the net impression of the book can hardly be to give one more than a slight idea of what seems really an important matter .

		Or if the subject be the serious one of the continued existence and relation of ourselves to those whom we have once loved and lost , why should it be advertised as something connected with crystal balls and announcements in the news - papers ?

		There may be those who will think it merely humorous to spend so much space in talking of ideas in connection with the work of these authors .

		If it be so .

		we believe that the fault -LRB- such as there may be -RRB- must lie with the authors and their publishers .

		If the '' ideas '' are not to be taken seriously , if mention of them be merely a device to make people fancy they are reading something worth while , if we have really something meant to stir the blood rather than to stimulate the thought , then why this allusion to .

		even insistence on .

		32 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 6	DATE	the other thing ?

		To tell the truth , we rather fancy that these able writers are only toying with ideas , thoughts , conceptions , or , as we might almost call them , whims , fancies , no - tions .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	doubtless has much at heart the conception of a finer life than that of
America	LOCATION	to-day , we wish he had sought to work out the positive side as definitely as he has the negative .

		Mr.
London	PERSON	is obviously using his '' fundamental idea '' as a literary means .

		That he does not really believe the experiences of
Darrell Standing	ORGANIZATION	are more than fancies , is clear at the very beginning .

		The star-rover in his first flight is impressed with the idea that he must touch each star with a glass wand ; which shows , of course , that there was no reality in the flight , nor is there more reality in the later scenes .

		Of Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	it need only be said that while he has treated his subject with delicacy and reserve , he has turned the real interest of Ms book -LRB- as far as we can see -RRB- in quite another direction .

		It is perhaps a tribute to the attractions of the intellectual life , or the spiritual , that such books should appear before the public as hav - ing something to say on `` ideas . ''

		We hope that their readers who are doubtless people who enjoy the world of adventure or the world of gaiety or both will be attracted to that other world so different from that with which they are familiar , and yet so closely related to it .

		If they are so attracted , they will have no difficulty in finding competent

		American literature , 1870-1892 .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The title of Professor
Fred Lewis Pattee	PERSON	's latest book , `` A History of American Literature since 1870 '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , seems to threaten a catalogue of story-writers and poets of to-day ; but the preface reassures the reader with the promise that only writers who did distinctive work before
1892	DATE	will be included .

		The quarter-century following the Civil War is now far enough in the past to make possi - ble an evaluation of its literary output , and it is fortunate that the first attempt at such an evaluation has been made by a scholar with an established reputation for careful and thorough work in American literature .

		Not all students will agree with all of Professor
Pattee	PERSON	's judgments .

		His critical standards may be inferred from some of his pet aver - sions the baneful influence of
Keats	PERSON	, `` Long - fellowism , '' '' so conventional a thing as a sonnet , '' and indeed all carefully elaborated writing .

		It is not strange , therefore , that he finds much to praise in
Artemus Ward	PERSON	,
Whit	LOCATION	- man ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	.

		`` Ramona '' is `` an exquisite work of art , '' and gives its author '' a place indeed with the two or three best writers of American ro - mance '' ; and the stories of
Kate Chopin	PERSON	a name possibly not known to every reader are '' equal to the best that has been produced in
France	LOCATION	or even in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		On the other hand , he has little but judicially phrased con - tempt for
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and
Aldrich	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Even those who dissent most sharply from his judgments will , how - ever , value his criticisms for their frankness and consistency .

		Some objection may be raised to the bringing in of authors whose distinctive work was done before the year so definitely set forth in the title .

		A student of the `` Biglow Papers '' and `` The Fable for Critics '' may be astounded to learn that ''
Lowell	PERSON	, so much of whose early heart and soul had been given to
Europe	LOCATION	, discov - ered
America	LOCATION	in this same Centennial year -LSB- 1876 -RSB- '' ; and in view of the author 's thesis that the distinctive characteristics of his period are traceable to the Civil War .

		it seems hardly fair to include Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	,
Timrod	LOCATION	, and others of their time , and even to devote a long section to
Thoreau	LOCATION	on the na'ive ground that `` in spirit and influence .

		.

		he belongs to the period after
1870	DATE	. ''

		A few vagaries like this stamp the author as just a little of a special pleader .

		The few noticeable slips , such as the statement that
Marion Crawford	PERSON	wrote no short stories , come from a tendency to be sweepingly dogmatic .

		But on the whole , the work is scholarly , and granted the crit - ic 's assumptions as to what American litera - ture ought to be logically sound .

		Full and sympathetic recognition is given to the work of the South since the War , and the sections dealing with Southern writers are especially well done .

		Attractive in binding and letter-press , compact each volume runs to about 130 pages and '' done , not by literary hacks , but by fellow-craftsmen of a younger generation , distinguished for imaginative work , '' as the advertisement recites , these little handbooks should be well received .

		While the average reader who has a natural craving for Bos - wellian gossip may meet with some disap -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 33 pointment in their subject matter , the reader j who likes to study his author more technically and to analyze and discuss his work , will be j better pleased .

		That is to say , although each of these volumes is introduced as `` a biog - raphy and a critical estimate , '' the biography is in each instance negligible : eight pages in , the ``
Bennett	PERSON	, '' three in the `` Wells . ''

		suffice ; the real `` vital facts , '' it is assumed , appear , in the more or less elaborate analysis of j each novelist 's literary achievement as re - !

		corded in subsequent pages .

		Of the two stud - -RSB- ies , that of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	strikes us as the !

		clearer and more satisfactory , although per - haps there is no good reason for such a con - trast .

		Mr.
Darton	PERSON	identifies the subject of !

		his study intimately with the spirit of that '' domicile of origin , '' the
Staffordshire	LOCATION	district which this novelist has made familiar to the world .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	'' is a Five Townsman keen , interested , exceedingly shrewd , very practical and efficient , limited in certain di - rections , rather coarse-fibred in others . ''

		He also declares that , like his fellow Five Towns - men .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is `` high strung , '' an epithet that the reader will find explained satisfactorily .

		The chapter on the Five j Towns , by the way , is one of the best in the book , and contains a capital description of the topography of
Stoke-on-Trent	LOCATION	, with a map for the complete identification of places men - tioned in the novels of the Five Towns .

		Natu - rally , Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	can hardly perform a similar service for his hero he insists , far more strongly than Mr.
Darton	PERSON	, that his ' hero is a hero ; but rather confines his effort to asserting the normality of Mr.
`` Wells	PERSON	and of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's vision .

		He sees him as `` re - garding all life from a reasonable distance . ''

		He maintains the superiority of the romances to those of
Jules Verne	PERSON	, and regards Mr.
Wells	PERSON	as second to none as a writer of romances of this type .

		He is less certain of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's position as a novelist , but feels no hesita - tion in the claim that he is one of the great writers ; and that alone , among the novel - | ists of the day , he has used his perfected art for a definite end .

		He has pointed the possi - ble road of our endeavor .

		He has set up the ideal of a finer civilization .

		Records of '' the glory that teat
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		In view of the rapidly grow - ing responsibility of American scholarship , it is particularly pleasing to greet a volume of the ambitious series now being issued by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	under the general title of '' Records of Civilization . ''

		The aim of the series is as praiseworthy as it is comprehen - sive .

		`` In the first place , its intention is to make accessible those sources of the history of
Europe	LOCATION	and of the near
East	LOCATION	which are of prime importance for the understanding of Western civilization .

		In the second place , both by the treatment of these texts and by special studies it covers the work of modern scholars in these fields .

		It is , therefore , a guide both to the original documents and to recent criticism .

		The material , furthermore , is given in English translation , in order that it may be readily accessible to students and readers who do not have that knowledge of classical and other foreign languages which is essential for specialized research . ''

		Profes - sor
James T. Shotwell	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has been selected as general editor , and the history workers of
America	LOCATION	will feel that the choice has been felicitous .

		The volume before us , edited by Professors
G. W. Botsford	PERSON	and
E. G. Sihler	PERSON	, deals with `` Hellenic Civiliza - tion '' ; and we have no doubt that it has proved a more difficult task than will any of its successors .

		It is the old story of an embarras de richesse , and Dr.
Shotwell	PERSON	has forestalled the critic by writing : '' The selec - tions have been made , not for specialists , but for those who are interested in general Hel - lenic culture .

		Nothing could be easier than to suggest the lengthening or shortening of passages and the addition or substitution of other selections .

		No two scholars could agree as to what is absolutely best for a volume of the kind ; and those who have cooperated in its preparation can only hope that it may in some degree contribute to an understanding of the spirit of ancient Hellas and add to the interest in her culture . ''

		It remains to be said , however , that while the general level of translation is high , a few of the renderings are simply villainous from the side of ade - quate English .

		-LRB- Vide pp. 190 , 191 , et al. -RRB- The bibliographies , again , are generally ad - mirable ; but any reviewer with a sense of humor will note with a kindly smile some of the inclusions and omissions .

		Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	, apparently , has written nothing on Plato that is worthy of recording beside the contributions enumerated .

		The index is fair , but in a book of this nature it might well have been more extensive .

		If we may assume that '' Hellenic Civilization '' represents the material form of the series , we shall have a set of large and clearly printed books , run - ning to about seven hundred pages each .

		Eighteen volumes have been definitely listed as in preparation , and others will be an - nounced later .

		It is to be hoped that the general editor and his collaborators will not allow themselves to be hurried , and that this 34 THE DIAL -LSB-

		versus recent contributions to the lit - MaanaCharta , era t ure of international law , renewed interest in which has been stimulated by the great war , is a volume entitled '' War : Its Conduct and Legal Results '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by two well known English scholars , Profes - sors
Baty	PERSON	and
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their treatise is note - worthy in being perhaps the only work which undertakes to state the legal effect of war upon the local or municipal law in this case , upon the law of
England	LOCATION	.

		It does not pretend to be a study of the questions of in - ternational law to which the present war has given rise , although some of these are touched upon , notably where the provisions of the
Hague Convention	ORGANIZATION	regarding the laws and customs of war are compared with those of the German war manual -LRB- which , by the way , Professor
Morgan	PERSON	has recently translated into English -RRB- .

		The present work is devoted mainly to an exposition of the effect of war upon contracts , the status of alien enemies , trade with the enemy , personal liberty , lib - erty of the press , and , in general , the status of the civil population as a whole throughout the realm .

		It is based largely on the decisions of the English and American courts ; but the treatment is non-technical and to a remarka - ble degree popular in character .

		There is a critical examination of all the important emergency war legislation enacted since the outbreak of the present conflict , and the text of this legislation is reprinted in an appen - dix of more than one hundred pages .

		While stating that '' we are all united in the convic - tion that never was a cause more just or a war more righteous , '' the writers have sub - jected the measures of the government to a severe criticism , and applied to them the strict tests of legality in a way which it may safely be assumed would not be tolerated if it were attempted in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Their criti - cism of the
Defence	ORGANIZATION	of the Realm and Press Censorship Acts , and the regulations issued in pursuance thereof , is particularly severe .

		These drastic measures are declared to be un - precedented because they create new offences and make them punishable by a procedure unknown to the common law .

		The effect , we are told , is for some purposes '' to deprive the whole civil population .

		.

		of the right to trial by jury and to enable a court-martial to sen - tence any one contravening those regulations to penal servitude for life . ''

		This , notwithstand - ing the fact that the
King	LOCATION	's Courts are still open and that his writs still run throughout the realm .

		Liberty of the press , it is affirmed , is '' in a precarious condition it hangs by a thread . ''

		Never in the history of
England	LOCATION	, we are told , has the executive assumed such arbitrary power over the life , liberty , and property of British subjects .

		`` The net of restriction is now so finely woven , so ingen - iously designed , that it enmeshes every activ - ity of the citizen .

		The military authorities can .

		deport the whole population of any town or village from one part of the country to another .

		They could totally close all the public houses throughout the
United King	ORGANIZATION	- dom for every hour of the day for the whole period of the war ... They can on mere sus - picion arrest any one without warrant and can equally without warrant enter any house by day or by night .

		They can punish with penal servitude for life any journalist who speculates as to the plan of campaign .

		.

		and with six months imprisonment if he criticizes the dietary or accommodation of the new recruits . ''

		They can stop any citizen , close any road , or compel the whole population to keep indoors . ''

		We must leave the reader to judge for himself whether this ` parliamentary despotism ' which recalls nothing so much as the kind of legislation hitherto exclusively re - served for uncivilized protectorates , is either necessary or wise . ''

		Such is the regime under which the English are living to-day ; yet
England	LOCATION	, although `` at war , '' is not in a `` state of war , '' a distinction which the authors regard as sound and fundamental .

		impressionist * Mr -
James Hunekcr	PERSON	has been studies in art fortunate in the title of his latest volume , '' Ivory , Apes and Peacocks '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Whether intended in an ironic sense or not , it suggests both the qualities and the limitations of the essays .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	continues , of course , to devote himself to the '' modern '' and '' ultra-modern '' European movements in music , literature , and art .

		The new volume discusses such men as
Schoenberg	PERSON	,
Matisse	ORGANIZATION	,
Van Gogh	PERSON	,
Gauguin	PERSON	, and the Italian Futurists , as well as
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Dostoieffsky	LOCATION	,

		Critics , '' he says , '' are like prize-fighters , they must keep in constant training else they go ' stale . ' ''

		His conception of art is that of

		A text which may be considered an `` irreducible minimum '' is presented by Mr.
Ernest Wilson Clement	PERSON	in his '' Short History of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In one hun - dred and fifty pages he has outlined fifteen hundred years of recorded history , and has found space for references to social condi - tions , literature , and art .

		As the more impor - tant authorities are cited , the reader may easily turn to the more extensive works .

		Half the volume deals with the period before
1603	DATE	, and the remainder treats of the
Tokugawa Shogunate	ORGANIZATION	and the Meiji Era .

		The appen - dices include an account of the physiography of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, with lists of the provinces by circuits , the prefectures , the emperors and empresses , the shoguns , the regents , and the Japanese name periods .

		The volume also con - tains a map of present-day
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The work is well done when the limitations of space are considered .

		A few errors , however , should be corrected in a text which will have wide use .

		Hideyoshi 's letter to the Governor of
the Philippines	LOCATION	was delivered -LRB- p. 78 -RRB- ; Chinese about .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	is himself thoroughly `` modern . ''

		He dislikes and fears -LRB- half - seriously -RRB- the music of
Schoenberg	PERSON	, and he thinks that the Futurists `` have mistaken their vocation .

		They should have been musi - cians or writers , or handle the more satisfac - tory , if less subtle , cinematograph . ''

		But he | refuses to reject either Futurism or
Schoen	PERSON	- j berg .

		`` I should n't be surprised if ten years hence
Arnold Schoenberg	PERSON	proves quite as con - ventional a member of musical society '' as
Richard Strauss	PERSON	and

		One wonders how long this quest and adventure can be kept up without exhaustion , without realizing that our '' mod - ernists '' are most of them living too much on their temperaments .

		What one misses in Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's criticism , and in the * modern move - ments in all the arts , is character , that con - cern for the permanent which meant so much to

		From the
H. W. Wilson Company	ORGANIZATION	we have two useful works for debaters . ''

		Selected Articles on Prohibition of the Liquor Traffic , '' compiled by Dr.
Lamar T. Beman	PERSON	, has abun - dant bibliographical references and a pre - liminary outline of both affirmative and nega - tive arguments .

		The bibliography fills thirty - four pages , the argumentative selections nearly five times as much space .

		The book forms one of the `` Debaters ' Handbook Se - ries . ''

		In the '' University Debaters ' Annual '' for
1914-5	DATE	-LRB- the first of a promising series -RRB- are found arguments for and against the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, the increase of our army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, the minimum wage , government ownership of telegraph and telephone , the single tax , and socialistic control of the means of production and exchange .

		From college and university debates these arguments are taken , but they represent considerable scholarly application and are accompanied by sufficiently full bibli - ographies to enable the reader to pursue the subjects further if he so desires .

		Psychological In his volume entitled `` The studies of three Criminal Imbecile '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , * e - Dr.
Henry H. Goddard	PERSON	analyses three remarkable murder cases .

		The criminal is in each case a boy of low mentality , show - ing by test the development of about a ten or eleven year old child , in actual age , sixteen , nineteen , and twenty-four years .

		The aggres - sive sex-impulse enters , or the mere negative one of suggestibility under another 's power .

		The first boy killed his school teacher ; the plea of imbecility was admitted , mainly upon the basis of psychological tests .

		The second case was involved , and showed the hypnotic type of influence ; a verdict of murder in the first degree was rendered .

		In the third case the young man shot down a girl who refused his attentions , and is now in prison for life ; though twenty-four years of age , he has exer - cised for the last twelve years only the men - tality that he had developed at the time of his crime .

		The social menace of such cases is the theme of Dr.
Goddard	PERSON	's monograph .

		The con - tribution is peculiarly valuable in showing how the recognition of abnormality is an ex - pert matter .

		To the layman the criminality is far more conspicuous and abhorrent than the imbecility .

		The different play of the `` sex '' factor is convincing .

		The masculine trend for action and the play of violent emotions shows itself in the pathological manifestations .

		How the ''
Lusitania	PERSON	' went down .

		Strikingly at variance with the findings of the official inquiry are Mr.
Charles E. Lauriat	PERSON	's ob - servations on the occasion of the sinking of the '' Lusitania . ''

		In fact , he himself says in his book , '' The Lusitania 's Last Voyage '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , that they `` are as diametrically opposite from ` those of Lord
Mersey	ORGANIZATION	's Court as they well could be . ''

		But it is evident to any impartial reader that Mr.
Lauriat	PERSON	re - mained cool and calmly observant from the moment the torpedo struck the ship on which he was a passenger , to the end of that appal - ling catastrophe .

		As one proof of his remark - able freedom from anything like panic , the follower of his brief but clear narrative notes his allowing himself just enough time , as the vessel was rapidly listing to starboard , to go below to his stateroom , walking in the angle formed by the floor and side wall of the pas - sage , and secure certain personal belongings from his luggage .

		It is already known how intelligently and fearlessly helpful he was in saving other lives besides his own .

		Briefer than was Mr.
Lawrence Beesley	PERSON	in narrating the tragedy of the '' Titanic , '' Mr.
Lauriat	PERSON	re - counts events of a similar but more startling nature , in which he himself figures , modestly enough , as an actor of some importance .

		The report of Lord
Mersey	ORGANIZATION	's court of inquiry is added , and some significant extracts from the `` Frankfurter Zeitung '' of
May 9	DATE	are given in both German and English .

		The whole con - stitutes not only a '' document '' of historic interest , but a thrilling narrative of the greatest disaster of its kind .

		The obvious purpose of Profes - i te * t - * > 0 k t f sor
Arthur L. Cross	PERSON	's `` History Enghsh history .

		/ .

		- n-ij j ^ i - r-r of
England	LOCATION	and Greater Brit - ain '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is to fit the demands of a text for advanced classes in colleges and uni - versities .

		For such a purpose the book fur - nishes a good basis .

		It is a fresh treatment of the subject in a large volume of over eleven
1916	DATE	-RSB- 37 hundred pages , supplied with very good maps and competent references to other works and sources .

		Professor Cross brings his narrative up to
February , 1914	DATE	, within six months of the beginning of the European war .

		The book comprehends the history of
England	LOCATION	, and its expansion into greater
Britain	LOCATION	, within fifty-seven chapters , and employs the topical method of presenting the subject-matter .

		It touches the political , social , and literary de - velopment of the country in due proportion .

		The paragraphs dealing with literary history , however , suggest a less confident acquain - tance with the sources than those dealing with political and industrial development .

		The book aims at the presentation of facts in the light of their significance and historical suc - cession , and makes slight attempt to appraise events or interpret the spirit and character of the English people .

		It is probably the most satisfactory text-book in its field for college courses thus far written by an American scholar .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The process of development of the honey bee from the egg through the larval stage is described with much technical detail in '' The Embryology of the Honey Bee '' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
J. A. Nelson	PERSON	, expert in bee culture investiga - tions in the
Bureau of Entomology	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is of value to scientific bee culturists , and will form a welcome addition to the libraries of colleges and universities , since it gives a very full and connected account of the development of a highly specialized representative of that most important group of animals , the insects , A full bibliography and an ample index , as well as abundant illustrations , add to the book 's value as a work of reference .

		A second series of '' Essays for College Men , '' under the editorship of Messrs.
Norman Foerster	PERSON	,
Frederick A. Manchester	PERSON	, and
Karl Young	PERSON	, has been issued by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		It maintains the high level reached in the preceding volume . ''

		What Is a College ForT '' by President
Wilson	PERSON	, `` Academic Leadership '' by Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	, and '' The Religion of Humanity '' by Hon.
Arthur James Balfour	PERSON	are titles which indicate that many of the essays selected are admirably suited to the purpose of the series .

		But the wisdom of including such an essay as '' The American Scholar '' may be ques - tioned .

		That college men should know it will not be disputed ; but it is so easily accessible already that one begrudges it space in a volume of this kind .

		Another useful reference book comes from the indefatigable pen of Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	, and this time it has to do with '' Heroes and
Heroines of Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, Classical , Mediaeval , Legendary '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		Thus it forms a companion volume or supplement to his similarly entitled work dealing with modern fictitious names .

		Much industrv is shown in its compilation ; here and there , perhaps , excessive industry , as where he writes of Ahasuerus and
Cartaphilos	PERSON	and the Wandering Jew , in three separate paragraphs , but with no cross references , no sending of the reader to the longest and best of the entries , that under '' Wandering Jew . ''

		On the other hand , some defect of industry seems to be re - sponsible for the omission of the Seven Champions of
Christendom	LOCATION	,
Emerson	PERSON	's '' sacred Seven '' which many a reader of '' Brahma '' has puzzled over .

		Not far from four hundred double-column , fine - print pages are given to Mr.
Walsh	PERSON	's fruitful and interesting theme .

		Professor
Henry Seidel Canby	PERSON	's '' College Sons and College Fathers '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a new and sane discussion of the much-mooted question of college education .

		Professor
Canby	PERSON	looks at the question from the standpoint of the teacher , the student , and the student 's parents , and he maintains a rare bal - ance between sympathy and detachment in his treatment of each of these classes .

		Everywhere he shows mature thought and insight , nowhere snap judgment or sensationalism .

		He is human through - out , and because he is human he deals with essen - tials .

		`` The Undergraduate Background , '' `` The Colleges and Mediocrity , '' and '' Current Literature and the Colleges '' are a few of the chapter-headings that provoke attention and suggest the importance of the matters discussed .

		Mr.
John C. Wright	PERSON	, of
Harbor Springs	LOCATION	, Em - met County ,
Michigan	LOCATION	, has industriously collected a score or more of the native legends of his neighborhood and published them under the title , '' Stories of the Crooked Tree . ''

		This semi-mythi - cal tree , known in Jesuit missionary annals as '' I ` Arbre Croche , '' is supposed to have stood in or near what is now
Middle Village	LOCATION	, and has an interesting legend of its own to explain its crook - edness .

		Other characteristic Indian folklore is not wanting to fill out Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's volume , and the author has added the necessary historical com - mentary , with an abundance of full-page illustra - tions from photographs .

		He has had previous experience in work of this sort , and his present book is a notable contribution to the legendary lore of our aborigines .

		-LRB- The Lakeside Press , Har - bor Springs ,
Michigan	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		The Princeton idea , less to contribute to knowl - edge than to aid in its assimilation , finds notable expression in Mr.
Clarence Ward	PERSON	's '' Mediaeval Church Vaulting , '' lately added to the ''
Princeton Monographs	ORGANIZATION	on Art and Archaeology '' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The few novel views are con - fessedly subordinate to the purpose of the work , which is '' to give in a compact and systematic form a thorough resume of all the principal forms of vaulting employed in the middle ages . ''

		The study of origins and motives , however , is too attractive to permit the author to forego it , in spite of the limi - tations of his systematic formula ; and many of his most interesting observations deal with questions of such a character .

		In fulness and logic of presenta - tion the book adequately fulfils its purpose ; while unhackneyed photographs , clear typography , and becoming form make it a pleasure to read .

Jan. 20	DATE	THE articles by
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	, which appear each month in The Forum , are the first constructive , purely aesthetic art criticisms to appear in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's aesthetic rationale is neither personal nor merely scholastic ; it is founded on definite knowledge of emotional apperceptions and reactions , and adheres to the facts recorded by the leading European scientists and psychologists who have made a profound study of subtle and complex problems of aesthetics .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's criticisms mean more than mere transient records and opinions .

		They possess a philosophic and educational appeal which is stimulating and interesting even to those not particularly concerned with painting .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is neither a teacher nor a detractor .

		You will not be concerned as to whether you personally agree or disagree with him .

		But you will be stimulated .

		You will be set thinking .

		You will find that there are more possibilities of aesthetic enjoyment than you are aware of .

		You will have new viewpoints opened up to you .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is accomplishing something new and highly important .

		He has lifted criticism out of its old rut of dogma and prejudice and sentimentalism , and has placed it on a solid foundation from which all art lovers no matter how divergent their tastes will gain a clearer and profounder vision .

		Dr.
Christian Brinton	PERSON	says that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's art criticism u is a vindication of the metaphysical method as applied to aesthetic inter - pretation .

		It satisfies the intellect , and at the same time is not devoid of the requisite charm of statement . ''


William Marion Reedy	PERSON	says : ``
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	comes nearer to revealing for us the anatomy of art and its spirit , too , than any writer I ever read . ''

		Andre Tridon calls Mr.
Wright	PERSON	``
America	LOCATION	's first aesthetician , '' and adds : `` A standard of criticism has been set , and this standard reposes on the most durable foundation , the animating purpose of all great creative expression . ''

		, 87 THE `` DISTINCTION ' LONGFELLOW : OF A few seasons ago , when a celebrated trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	pianist returned to
America	LOCATION	for the first extended tour that he had undertaken here in a number of years , an Olympian critic bitterly complained because of his placing upon his programmes certain of the composi - tions of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` An artist , '' the re - viewer wrote , `` acclaimed the first of living pianists , owes it to his public to offer it some - thing of greater distinction than outmoded specimens of an invertebrate art which , in these days , should be consecrated to the young ladies ' boarding-schools and not obtruded upon the mature musical intelligence , '' or words to that effect .

		But there was balm left in
Gilead	ORGANIZATION	.

		For not long afterward another eminent trans-Atlantic virtuoso who visited these shores offered to the public a `` tone - poem '' in which a contemporary composer had endeavored to depict the emotions which the passage of a reverberant express-train over an evidently rudimentary railway had aroused within his breast .

		Tumultuous indeed was the resultant repercussion , and correspondingly surging was the enthusiasm of our critic , who asserted with conviction , almost with passion or as near passion as an Olympian critic may allow himself to betray , that the public -LRB- very obviously of `` mature musical intelli - gence '' -RRB- was vastly indebted to the executant for his interpretation of this distinguished example of the new art - forms with which mod - ern pianistic literature was being enriched .

		We can never sufficiently marvel , I think , at the critical capacity to take its artistic pleas - ures painfully .

		From modern art it seems , preferably , to demand a paralyzing punch upon the solar plexus , after which it most de - lights in being dragged by the heels to the top - most turret of the artist 's ivory tower and violently precipitated therefrom .

		The critical anatomy being admittedly indestructible , it then , having gathered itself together and picked itself up , hastens off to blacken paper to the effect that it has been its privilege to assist at a most distinguished performance . ''

		Distinguished ! ''

		potent word ! ''

		I think therefore I am , '' said
Descartes	PERSON	.

		`` It is dis - 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	tinguished therefore it is , '' says the Olym - pian critic of poem , painting , or polyphony of anything that aspires to consideration as an artistic achievement .

		`` Y-e-e-s , '' feebly as - sents the bourgeois bystander -LRB- who , as we all know , forms the indispensable background of Olympian criticism -RRB- , shuddering lest he make a mistake , `` but how am I to know what is distinguished from what is n't ? '' ''

		How in - deed ? ''

		is the response . ''

		To be frank , you can not .

		But I am here to instruct you .

		Fol - low me , and possibility of error is eliminated .

		For instance . ''

		And the next lesson ensues .

		I have just been studying one of these lessons , and I confess to a doubt to a doubt that swells to a suspicion of the infalli - bility of my Mentor ; who , in this case , is discussing the poet
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		To be par - ticular , he is offering what he terms a '' Por - trait of Longfellow '' ; and , as the finishing touch thereof , he pronounces him to have been , as a poet , utterly destitute of `` dis - tinction . ''

		Of Longfellow the man something different , he thinks , may be averred .

		One can even discern that he is rather pleased to be able to record that
Longfellow	LOCATION	was , humanly speaking , a truly distinguished gentleman ; and he bestows on him various approving phrases which must , to his benignant shade in its serene place upon
Parnassus	LOCATION	, be indeed most comforting .

		But of Longfellow the poet !

		Up go the Olympian eyebrows ; the Olympian nostrils dilate , and very palpably they sniff ; and the Olympian hand , with a weary gesture , altogether eliminates the au - thor of `` My Lost Youth , '' `` Palingenesis , '' and `` A Psalm of Life '' from his distinguished consideration .

		It is done with an assured inexorability that is final .

		But if the reader happens to have a portrait of Longfellow hanging upon his library wall -LRB- as some bour - geois readers who have not yet balanced them - selves upon the most vertiginous aiguilles of the New Parnassus possibly still have -RRB- he will raise his eyes to the pictured face and , as I have said , he will have his doubts , and his doubts will swell into suspicions .

		But not sus - picions of
Longfellow	LOCATION	, suspicions of the Olympian and oh , so distinguished , critic !

		In my opening paragraph I alluded to a composer Mendelssohn ; for , as I ponder his case and that of
Longfellow	LOCATION	, I find be - tween them a quite predicable parallelism : in their lives and works , the places which , in their respective pantheons , they occupy , and , above all , the `` distinction '' which , in Olym - pian estimation , they enjoy or , rather , lack !

		It is not , necessarily , complete , for such par - allels never can be ; still , the seeker for simili - tude will not fail to discover it should he compare the music of Mendelssohn with the poetry of
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		Both are character - ized by a spontaneous purity , sincerity , and sweetness , an exquisitely poignant emotional sensibility , an innate serenity and inimitable because quite unaffected grace ; by fineness of fibre , delicacy of timbre , and instinctive avoidance of things repulsive and repellent .

		Both poet and composer possessed effortless mastery of their technical resources , and are notable for the ease at which they sustained themselves at their own levels and the rarity with which , appreciably , they fell below them .

		Each is devoid of eroticism but instinct with love , as we contrast it with the implications of passion , though in this respect
Longfellow	LOCATION	's range is wider and his touch more vibrant .

		As their accomplishments were similar , so also were their limitations limitations from which they themselves would never have pre - sumed to claim exemption , for their unpre - tentiousness was complete , the '' immodesty of genius '' being foreign to their natures .

		Both also possessed extraordinary personal charm , and they remain incontestably among the best - beloved makers of music and poetry that yet have lived .

		If this correspondence has never before enforced itself , take down your Long - fellow and re-read '' Voices of the Night '' and others of those so familiar and so felicitous lyrics , and then once more scan the scores or harken to the audible music of '' Songs with - out Words '' ; turn again the leaves of ''
Evan	PERSON	- geline , '' `` Hiawatha , '' `` Tales of a Wayside Inn , '' or '' The Golden Legend , '' and then re - call the harmonies of the ''
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' overture , ''
Fingal	ORGANIZATION	's Cave , '' '' Sea - Calm and Happy Voyage , '' or ''
Elijah	PERSON	. ''

		It has become one of the established canons of Olympian criticism to depreciate both the poet and the composer .

		But this depreciation , while it may be `` distinguished , '' can not de - grade them ; because , happily enough , ` both
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Mendelssohn	PERSON	wrote , not for critics , but for lovers of poetry and music .

		It merely indicates , in the depreciators , a lack of sympathy , an insensibility , a delimitation , a sort of tone-deafness , for which they are , after
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 51 all , most to be pitied .

		To the lover of
Longfel	LOCATION	- low and
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, it may become rather tiresome at times , and rather sad ; until he remembers that nowadays the beaker of art is not dipped , ordinarily , into the Castalian
spring	DATE	, but filled from a siphon or even from a beer-pump !

		There is a great deal of fizz and foam at its brim and something -LRB- usually bitter -RRB- beneath , to be gulped down at a single swallow lest it gag the thirsting soul I was going to say , but perhaps throat would be more accurate .

		There is also a great deal of fizz and foam in what I may call the Xeo - or Beyond-Olympian criticism now flour - ishing ; to one of whose oracles we owe the statement -LRB- in a brand-new volume of superior finality -RRB- that
Longfellow	PERSON	's voice is that of '' a barrel-organ '' !

		An example of tone-deaf - ness not so piteous as it is out of all whooping .

		The Olympian or , more correctly , the
Brahminical	PERSON	critic is much given to fulmi - nating against those who discuss one of the arts in terms of another .

		To him music , let us say , is music , and poetry is poetry , and it is quite a monstrous thing to mix or mingle them in any way .

		But one making no pretensions to the critical estate , who began writing about a poet by referring to a musician , may be allowed to pursue his parallel between the two .

		It may be recalled , then , that
Hans von Billow	PERSON	, who was , in his early career , one of the original Wagnerian propagandists , and .

		in his latter days , was among the first to hail with enthusiasm the compositions of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, pronounced
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's `` Songs without Words '' as immortally classical as the lyrics of Goethe .

		Similarly , I chanced to read , not long ago , the verdict of a critic of like breadth and catholicity , who pronounced the lyrics and sonnets of Longfellow the most enduringly classical poetry to which
America	LOCATION	has yet given birth .

		I am well aware that the use of the adjective `` classical '' causes many people to see red , metaphorically speaking .

		That is , if I may be permitted a Celticism , they see something which they think ought to be red but from which , they imagine , all vestiges of color have carefully been removed and life replaced by petrifaction .

		Which is , indeed , most lamenta - ble , most melancholy .

		Because , on account of this unfortunate habit of mind they are miss - ing , in a literary sense , half their lives !

		If thev onlv knew what a classic , a true classic .

		really is !

		How infinitely precious , how peren - nially pleasure-giving , how perdurably , thril - lingly , sentiently alive !

		Why can not they emulate Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	, who finds first
Pitts	PERSON	- burgh and then the Parthenon subjects that inspire him to the production of masterpieces ?

		In
Longfellow	LOCATION	's case it happens , as a fur - ther curious commentary , that this so purely and so surely '' classical '' poet has been , since first his voice was lifted , the chosen singer of youth .

		If you will turn to the newly pub - lished volumes of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's `` Inter - pretations of Literature '' an unexpected retrieval of gold and gems from the grave you will there find a chapter on Longfellow which , coming as it does from a man recog - nized as the finest literary artist identified with modern American literature and one of the finest ever identified with any , should give some of the depreciators pause ; so replete is it with reverence , with love , and with appre - ciation .

		In its course
Hearn	PERSON	says that the boy who does not love
Longfellow	LOCATION	is , in a vital way , deficient in poetical sympathy ; and that a man who , having loved
Longfellow	PERSON	in his youth , afterward depreciates and sneers at him , is defective in his organization .

		To be sure , this was written some fifteen years ago .

		which , as time goes nowadays in the
Garden of Poesy	LOCATION	, is a very long while .

		Would
Hearn	PERSON	's rapport with
Longfellow	PERSON	have found such unequivocal expression had it been granted him to survive another decade and witness what it has brought ?

		Was it his misfortune to pass from the literary scene before its poetical structures began to be erected in the Perpendicular Style ; before the gargoyle had become greater than the cathedral , the mas - caron more than the vase ; before the organ was supplanted by the steam-calliope and the harp by the horse-fiddle ?

		Or was it rather incalculably his good fortune ?

		I will not pre - tend to say .

		But of this I am sure , that youth , in its essence , is unchanging , immortal .

		What it has always loved , that it will always continue to love .

		And those of us who are so happy as to retain our youthfulness of spirit , our early sensitiveness and sympathy , to the '' grand climacteric '' and beyond , will con - tinue to cherish the poetry of
Longfellow	LOCATION	in our hearts , irrespective of the dicta of Olym - pian criticism .

		For what is the necessity of '' distinction '' to that which we love ?

MERRILL	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One of the greatest misfortunes of the pres - ent war is the check which it has given to the expansion , so well under way , of a sane inter - nationalism and the consequent increased de - velopment which it has given to a narrow , excessive , unhealthy , military nationalism .

		Two striking examples of this evil present themselves at this moment in the world of French letters , I refer to the attacks on and defence of
Romain Holland	PERSON	and
Comte de Gobineau	ORGANIZATION	now going on , even beyond the boun - daries of
France	LOCATION	, in reviews , newspapers , and conversations .

		Perhaps it is not going too far to say that the person who has done most to make
Romain Rolland	PERSON	known is Dr.
Paul Seippel	PERSON	, a Swiss Protestant literary critic , born in
Geneva	LOCATION	but now professor at the
Zurich	LOCATION	Federal Poly - technic School , who has travelled in
America	LOCATION	and written a book on our country .

		It should be noted that '' Jean-Christophe '' is more appreciated in
Switzerland	LOCATION	than in
France	LOCATION	; and when some two years ago the French Academy awarded it the Literature Prize , Dr.
Seippel	PERSON	published a triumphant article which did not have its equal in
France	LOCATION	.

		Now , Dr.
Seippel	PERSON	is the author of another book which has made a certain noise , ''
Les Deux Frances	PERSON	, '' in which he shows that he neither understands nor values what he calls '' la
France	LOCATION	noire , '' that is , catholic and traditionalist
France	LOCATION	, nor `` la
France	LOCATION	rouge , '' that is , revolutionary and free-thinking
France	LOCATION	.

		So when Professor
Seippel	PERSON	praises a French writer , one may con - clude that this writer represents an excep - tional
France	LOCATION	, which is neither `` black '' nor `` red , '' a writer who can not be completely liked or comprehended in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day and who , consequently , must feel himself rather out of place in his own country .

		So here may be found the cause of much of the criticism to which
Romain Rolland	PERSON	is sub - jected at this moment , and the cause also of many of his own acts which have increased this tendency to find fault with him .

		Let me give some specimens of these criti - cisms , which I take from letters to me or from conversations , of course with the permission of the writers or speakers .

		M.
Jean Finot	PERSON	, editor of '' La Revue , '' says : '' It does not suffice to be virtuous ; one must also act virtuously .

		But
Romain Rolland	PERSON	has done everything to produce the contrary effect .

		At the beginning of the war , he could claim to be igno - rant of its causes and its authors .

		At that time he could write with serenity ' Au-dessus de la Melee . '

		But the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	and the divulging of the diplomatic documents should have made it impossible for him to remain any longer at
Geneva	LOCATION	, far from
France	LOCATION	which needed all her sons .

		His plain duty was to aid in creating the atmosphere of heroism necessary for the triumph of the cause of humanity .

		But he preferred to shut himself up in his ivory tower and sow doubts as to the beauty and the grandeur of the efforts of the Allies .

		I am quite ready to believe in his sin - cerity , but I deplore the way in which he shows it .

		If he is unable to discover the motives and the meaning of the grand international tragedy , he might at least keep still .

		But he is guilty , unin - tentionally , of the crime of demoralizing a group of youths who , influenced by his quasi-heroic atti - tude , show an unseeming indifference as to the con - sequences of the war , which in the end must be the triumph of good or evil , the saving or the loss of humanity . ''

		The only child of the late
Pere Hyacinthe	PERSON	, Lieutenant
Paul Hyacinthe Loyson	PERSON	, whose mother and wife were , by the way , both Amer - icans , and who is now an interpreter in the army , has been especially severe on
Romain Rolland	PERSON	.

		His '' Un
Appel	PERSON	a
Romain Rolland	PERSON	, '' in `` La Revue '' for
November	DATE	, is one of the strongest arraignments of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	that has appeared .

		Its spirit is summed up in these lines which I have just received from
Le Havre	LOCATION	, where Lieutenant Loyson is at present : '' I have long loved and admired
Romain Rol	PERSON	- land , and it is for this that I deplore more than most persons that the folly of pride has precipi - tated him into the absurd .

		By remaining outside of his native land during the war and by refusing in what he writes he alone , he absolutely alone , of all men of all parties to proclaim the good right of
France	LOCATION	, he has magnificently proved this right . ''

		Lieutenant Loyson is about to publish `` Etes-vous Neutres devant le Crime ? ''

		-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Berger-Levrault -RRB- , an answer to `` Au - dessus de la Melee . ''

		At the head of the vol - ume will appear the following letter from
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, which I am here able to make public for the first time and which shows plainly how this well-known Belgian poet stands in the
Rolland	LOCATION	controversy : '' All that I wrote in ' La Belgique Sanglante ' shows how happy I am , in these dark days when right is sabered by the reiters and cuffed by the emperors , to offer you a proof of my esteem .

		The present war is a wicked war .

		It is aimed at the highest and the proudest ideals set up on this earth by men since they have thought and worked for the public weal .

		It should be hated ; there
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 should be no tergiversation in the name of a cold and culpable neutrality .

		One 's hands should not hold scales when the adversary holds a sword .

		I am consequently with you , and , notwithstanding all the friendship which I have for Remain Hol - land , I will not permit myself to take the side of his error . ''

		Some of his French critics have gone so far as to liken
Holland	PERSON	's case to that of
Dom Morin	PERSON	, a French priest now residing in Mu - nich , who has come out squarely for the Ger - mans .

		But this is very unfair to
Holland	LOCATION	, as Dom
Morin	PERSON	's case is wholly different .

		He is one of those ecclesiastics who look upon the Church as their true country , superior to their terrestrial country ; so , when the separation of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	came about in
France	LOCATION	, Dom
Morin	PERSON	emigrated to
Bavaria	LOCATION	, one of the nations where the Catholics are best treated , and there he was when the war broke out .

		It would be much nearer the right to compare
Holland	ORGANIZATION	's conduct with that of the German poet ,
Hermann Hesse	PERSON	, who at
Berne	LOCATION	is using his pen exactly as
Romain Holland	PERSON	is using his at
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		And now let me give the opinion of two witnesses for the defence , which , like the fore - going statements on the other side , are here published for the first time .


M. Alcide Ebray	PERSON	, long time foreign editor of the '' Journal des Debats '' and later French Consul General at
New York	LOCATION	, writes me : '' I do not think that
Romain Rolland	PERSON	can be justly accused of being anti-French .

		He appears to me rather to be one of those men , of whom there are not a few in
France	LOCATION	, who have a mixed or hybrid mentality .

		In ordinary times persons like
Romain Rolland	PERSON	can manage to keep alive in them these two spirits ; they can even use for good the bond uniting these two different mentali - ties .

		But in war times , their position becomes difficult .

		They try to play the part of conciliator , and be just and impartial , with the result that they please nobody .

		This is just what has hap - pened to
Romain Rolland	PERSON	.

		In
France	LOCATION	he is treated as a German and in
Germany	LOCATION	he is considered to be too lukewarm for the German cause .

		His case , therefore , seems to me more interesting from the psychological than from the patriotic standpoint . ''

		It will be remembered that until rather recently
Romain Rolland	PERSON	was professor of the history of music at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, which chair he filled with rare distinction until , run down by an automobile and gravely injured , he resigned the post to the great regret of the faculty .

		Here is the view taken of his present attitude by one of his former colleagues .

		Pro- fessor
Henri Lichtenberger	PERSON	, who was last year exchange professor at Harvard : '' I find that many people here in
France	LOCATION	are extremely unjust towards
Romain Rolland	PERSON	, who is one of the noblest-minded men I know , and whose broad Europeanism and spirit of equity are ad - mirable to behold .

		It is permissible to entertain different views as to the wisdom of his decision to remain in
Switzerland	LOCATION	during the war and to try and place himself above the contending parties .

		But one should bear in mind that
Romain Rolland	PERSON	has no military duties to perform , has no brother or son in the army , and is in bad health , and con - sequently in a much better position than most of us to assume this attitude . ''

		In the meanwhile
Rolland	PERSON	has done nothing to defend himself .

		Comte Fitz-James , the French dramatic critic , who has just returned to
Paris	LOCATION	from a visit to
Switzerland	LOCATION	, where he met
Rolland	PERSON	, tells me that the latter feels very keenly the way he has been treated in
France	LOCATION	, `` where the incriminated articles have been published , when published at all , only in a garbled form , '' and the charge is repeated in the preface to the volume just out , which gives them exactly as they were originally printed in the '' Journal de Geneve . ''

		`` Au-dessus de la Melee '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Ollendorff , 2 francs -RRB- is now in its fifteenth edition , which would seem to indicate that commercially these attacks have not been bad for
Rolland	PERSON	.

		I have just finished reading the book , one of the most interesting and notable that the war has produced , and I fail to find in it sufficient ground for the rough handling which the author has received from his own countrymen .


Rolland	PERSON	was in
Switzerland	LOCATION	when the war began , '' where he is now doing excellent work , '' Dr.
Seippel	PERSON	writes me from
Zurich	LOCATION	, `` in the `` War Prisoners Bu - reau at
Geneva	LOCATION	. ''

		Furthermore , in these arti - cles , he has always made a marked distinction between Prussian militarism and the grand old
Germany	LOCATION	we all admired and loved .

		The first he condemns as severely as anybody , but the latter he refuses to deny ; and the justifica - tion of his course he finds in this '' grand line from
Emerson	LOCATION	, '' which he gives in the original English : '' Nothing is more rare in any man than an act of his own . ''

		But what
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	said to me the other day seems to apply here . ''

		I find fault with
Romain Rol	PERSON	- land , '' says the literary editor of '' Le Temps , '' `` because he assimilates
France	LOCATION	to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But the latter has attacked us and we have had to defend ourselves .

		Again , the mental state of our intellectuals should not be likened to that of those of
Germany	LOCATION	, where practically all approve the conduct of their government .

		But it is perfectly sure that if
France	LOCATION	had attacked
Germany	LOCATION	and violated the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	, a large number of our intellec - tuals would have protested , the very oppo - site of what has happened in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		But that these articles and this book have exerted considerable influence for good is well proved 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	by an example which has come under my own eye .

		Comte Fitz-James said to me the other day : `` I had finished a volume on the war - ` Les Ennemis Interieurs ' and was on the point of giving it to my publisher , when the reading of
Romain Holland	PERSON	's book decided me to entirely remodel my manuscript .

		I still say what I said before , but with an attempt to attain the grandiose spirit of moderation set before the world by
Romain Rolland	PERSON	. ''

		The attacks on
Comte de Gobineau	ORGANIZATION	are of a still more virulent kind than those on
Romain Rolland	PERSON	, are far less excusable , and offer a prime example of nationalism gone mad ; for the man has been in his grave since
1882	DATE	, and his crime of pro-Germanism dates from the early fifties , fifteen years before the war of
1870	DATE	, and sixty years before the present con - flict .

		But this does not prevent his being torn to pieces in the most savage and vulgar fash - ion by a certain category of Frenchmen .

		When the war came , the surviving members of the
Gobineau	PERSON	family were quite prepared to see their father and grandfather severely taken to task for his now famous '' Essai sur rinegalite de
$ Races	MONEY	Humaines '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Didot , 1853-5 , 4 vols .

		in 8 -RRB- , where , in a word , the German race is placed at the head of civ - ilization .

		M.
Jean Richepin	PERSON	led off with a dig in one of his newspaper articles , and was fol - lowed by a contribution which appeared in `` Les Anales '' from the pen of
M. Herriot	PERSON	, mayor of
Lyons	PERSON	, who accuses Gobineau of being the cause of the war !

		Thereupon , the eldest daughter of Gobineau ,
Baroness Gul	PERSON	- dencrone , who inherits much of her father 's literary ability , rushed to his defence in the columns of '' Le Temps , '' where she contended that his theory had been misunderstood , and that he really held that the true and purest Teutons are the Scandinavians and even the Anglo-Saxons , whereas the Germans of to-day are more or less strongly affected by Slavic infiltrations .

		But this questionable apology did not prevent
M. Frederic Masson	PERSON	from coming to the rescue of the nationalist position with an extraordinary article which appeared at the head of the `` Revue Hebdomadaire '' of
October 16	DATE	, and which for a glaring instance of ultra-nationalism and general `` cussed - ness '' has seldom been equalled .

		Mme. Ser - peille , the youngest daughter of Gobineau , tells me that the manuscript as originally handed to the editor was even worse , and that
M. Fernand Laudet	PERSON	toned it down considera - bly before giving it to the printer .

		But just as it stands it is a disgraceful piece of work , which does not reflect credit on the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, of which the author is a member , or on the `` Revue Hebdomadaire , '' which can - not be too severely censured for having per - mitted such an offence to the living and the dead .

		In the `` Revue Hebdomadaire '' of
November 27	DATE	the grandson of
Comte de Gobineau	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Clement Serpeille	PERSON	, an intelligent young litterateur , publishes a brief and digni - fied reply to
M. Masson	PERSON	, who follows with some comments which do not at all remove the stain of his first article .

		Here is the place to quote a remark made to me the other day by a French authority on things German , whose name , however , had better not be given : `` Whatever
Frederic Masson	PERSON	writes on Ger - man affairs is utterly without any value , for he is a Germanophobe , as unreasonable and as absurd , it seems to me , as the Gallophobia of the most ridiculous Pan-Germans .

		Every time I read an article by
Masson	PERSON	or
Louis Ber	PERSON	- trand , I am thrown into a state of exaspera - tion .

		They make us the laughing-stock of all neutrals . ''

		If one would know what intelligent and au courant Frenchmen think of Gobineau , one should read the three articles by
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	, which appeared in '' Le Temps '' some two years ago ; '' La Vie et les Propheties du Comte de Gobineau , '' by the young journalist of `` Le Figaro , ''
M. Robert Dreyfus	PERSON	, perhaps the best book to give one an idea of the per - sonality and the intellectuality of
Gobineau	LOCATION	, where the frontispiece , a portrait of him , de - picts a highly cultivated man with a good head and aristocratic features ; and `` La Philoso - phic de I ` lmperialisme , '' by
Baron Ernest Seilliere	PERSON	, member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, a substan - tial study of the philosophy of
Gobineau	ORGANIZATION	's life and works .

		Then one will have a fair idea of this remarkable man and one will wonder still more at the impertinence of this
Masson	PERSON	tirade and vulgarity .

		This spirit of excessive nationalism finds an efficient corrective in the presence among the contemporary writers of
France	LOCATION	of a small but brilliant and active element of foreign-born men of letters , who see well beyond the borders of their adopted country .

		One of the most admirable of this group has unfortunately just died .

		I refer to the American poet ,
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	.

		I knew his father , who , in the latter seventies , was the blind lawyer of our Amer - ican colony , a learned , gentle-spirited man ; but I made the acquaintance of the talented son only when he had already become a recog - nized French poet .

		The last time we met was at a
Washington	LOCATION	's Birthday banquet here in
Paris	LOCATION	, when I , as toast-master , called upon
Francis Viele-Griffin	PERSON	, our other French - American poet , to read an original ode in
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 55 honor of the Father of his Country , while
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	led in the applause .

		And it is Viele-Griffin who to-day sends me for THE DIAL this admirable estimate and eulogy of our old and common friend : '' In the first letter I ever had from
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	, dated
New York	LOCATION	,
April 13 , 1887	DATE	, he ex - presses his aesthetic dream of the young poet : ' I am not the only American who is trying to endow the French alexandrine with a little of the enchant - ing music of English verse ; for you are , are you not ?

		a disciple of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		Ah !

		do n't deny it , for you need not be ashamed to admit that you are the disciple of that incomparable master , just as you might avow your being the disciple of
Wagner	PERSON	, without losing any of your own proper genius .

		To express the idea by words , to suggest emotion by the music of these words , such are , I think , the alpha and the omega of our doctrine . ' ''

		From the start ,
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	was , to use his own words , ' the poet of sonorities and splendors . '

		It is in his volume , ` Les Fastes , ' that he merits this title .

		In the works which followed , he showed himself , without losing any of his verbal virtu - .

		osity , to be the landscapist of the horizons of |
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	,
Grez	PERSON	, and
Marlotte	LOCATION	, where he often !

		spent his summers .

		His gorgeous music lent itself to the sincerities of the popular song , and in ' Les
Quatre Saisons	PERSON	' it is the triumph of life , at once calm and passionate , of the laborious poet whose window opens on the grand highway of
France	LOCATION	.

		Although
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	had travelled much , he trans - lated , like the painters of Barbizon , like Manet and
Corot	LOCATION	, only the landscape and atmosphere of the valley of the
Seine	LOCATION	.

		He is a true French poet '' The generosity and nobility of
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	's nature necessarily inclined him towards human suffering , and he lived in the hope of seeing the dawn of ' justice and fraternity , when the horrible butchery of the present hour surprised him in the midst of his dream .

		He was suffering from heart-disease , and still hopeful , he died from the terrible emo - tions in the midst of which we are now living , his eye fixed on the victory of justice and right .

		In ; fine , one of the best poets of a time which is rich in grand lyric bards ,
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	has passed away surrounded with the affectionate admiration of his peers and the esteem of those who enjoyed his intimacy , for the man in him was as noble as the poet was delicate , and the kindness of his heart equalled the idealism of his thought . ''

		The fact that
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	's wife was a Belgian and that he lived much of the year in the suburbs of
Brussels	LOCATION	strengthens Viele-Griffin 's intimation , shared by us all , that the war hastened his end .

		Some twelve years ago while I was writing I a letter to
John Hay	PERSON	.

		there was placed on my table a French periodical containing a critique by
Merrill of Hay	ORGANIZATION	as a poet .

		I sent it to `` Wash - ington by the same post as my letter , and in due season came a reply from the busy
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, which closed with this paragraph : '' Curiously enough , the paper came just as I was translating , or at least trying to translate , into English verse one of
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	's poems , which had struck my fancy .

		He is pretty hard on my so-called poetry , but I suppose it richly deserves all the censure which he bestows on it .

		I trust , however , that
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	will find my transla - tion worthy of the original .

		Let me know if he does . ''

		How like
John Hay	PERSON	this was !

		And his for - giving generosity is all the more admirable when we recall what is brought out in
Profes	LOCATION	- sor
Thayer	PERSON	's recent excellent biography of Hay , that it was one of the dreams of his early manhood to become above all things a great poet >
THEODORE STANTON	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
Dec. 30 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		LINGUISTIC THEORY AND PRACTICE never quite harmonize even in the writings of the most painstaking .

		Some little verbal or gram - matical or syntactical defect will be found to mar the otherwise perfect page of the most careful purist .

		But if perfection were attain - able instead of being always just beyond our reach and seductively inviting pursuit , what zest would there be left in living ?

		On the editorial page of an esteemed journal pub - lished in the cultured city of
Boston	LOCATION	there was recently printed an excellent plea for the preservation of our language in all its wealth of resources from innumerable fountains of supply , in all its fine distinctions and grada - tions , both verbal and grammatical .

		Espe - cially did the writer deplore the indiscriminate use as synonyms of words not synonymous , instancing '' would '' and '' should '' -LRB- but unac - countably making no mention of '' will '' and '' shall '' -RRB- .

		Always timely and never uncalled - for in a carelessly speaking and writing world are such reminders of our besetting sins of speech .

		Video meliora prorogue , deteriora sequor , is the shame-faced confession of even the best of us , including the excellent news - paper in question ; for this same editorial section was disfigured by such looseness of expression as the following , referring to the term '' preparedness '' and the different mean - ings given to it by different authorities : '' Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's definition is a more extreme one than most Americans of any other party . ''

		For a more violent ellipsis one might have to hunt far .

		In the same paragraph occurs '' the proposition to nominate Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	for President , '' wherein the use of '' proposition '' in the sense of `` proposal '' -LRB- a very frequent and even classic substitution -RRB- is to be noted 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	with at least mild disapproval .

		Since we have the two words , why render our language so much the poorer by making them interchange - able ?

		In
America	LOCATION	almost everything is now denotable by this much-abused term .

		For ex - ample , in ''
Wolfville	LOCATION	Nights '' we read : '' He could call a coyote or a fox , or even so fitful an ' nervous a prop ` sition as a antelope . ''

		AUTHORSHIP IN AN ALIEN TONGUE , in a lan - guage acquired with more or less effort after childhood , is not often brilliantly successful ; but there are not wanting a number of con - spicuous instances of such success .


Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, though born and bred in
Rome	LOCATION	, and speaking Latin as his mother tongue , wrote his `` Meditations '' in Greek .

		Blanco White -LRB-
Jose Blanco	PERSON	was his name in his native
Spain	LOCATION	-RRB- did not emigrate to
England	LOCATION	until he was thirty-five years old ; yet , besides other writings in his adopted language , he gave to English literature one of its finest sonnets .


Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen	PERSON	came to this coun - try from
Norway	LOCATION	at the age of twenty-one , and made English his chief medium of expres - sion as an author .

		The Dutch novelist known as ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' wrote almost exclu - sively in his adopted tongue .

		Mr.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	, famous on two conti - nents for his remarkable work , '' The
Founda	PERSON	- tions of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' is a Briton by birth and early training , being the son of a British admiral and the grandson of a Brit - ish naval captain , and apparently the last person to renounce his Briticism .

		But all the world knows , as he has taken pains to let it know , that he is now , and long has been , even more German than the Germans .

		Not only has he written chiefly in German , his master - piece above-named being in that tongue and translated into English by another hand , but he now turns against his native language , to - gether with all things English , in a fury of partisanship for German and
Germany	LOCATION	such as only a convert can show toward the per - versities and depravities of his unregenerate past .

		In an utterance addressed to the mis - guided people of his native land , and pub - lished in `` The International Review , '' he glorifies the nation that has produced a Treitschke , a
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, and a
Bernhardi	LOCATION	, and heaps extravagant praise upon its language . ''


Germany	LOCATION	alone , of all the nations , '' he as - sures his readers , `` still guards a living treas - ure , one capable of development , unfathomable as is everything which comes from God .

		It is her language . ''

		That our own language has a quite contrary origin he all but tells us in so many words , and he evidently believes that not the least of the benevolent ends held in view by the belligerent Teutons is the sup - planting of that decadent tongue .

		All this is depressing , not to say humiliating , to an English-speaking person ; but we may still be thankful that our language is not yet incapa - ble of effective use in so eloquent and enter - taining an article as that with which
Herr Chamberlain	PERSON	has favored us .

		THE FINEST PRIVATE LIBRARY IN THE WORLD , that of Mr.
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, has recently assured itself of this pre - eminence beyond doubt or cavil by a notable increase to its treasures through the addition of the collection hitherto owned by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	-
erick R. Halsey	PERSON	of the same city .

		About three-quarters of a
million dollars	MONEY	is rumored to have been the price paid by Mr.
Hunting	PERSON	- ton for the
Halsey	LOCATION	library , which itself is the fruit of thirty-five years of assiduous expert collecting in
Americana	LOCATION	, early English litera - ture , nineteenth-century first editions , rich bindings , and other precious rarities obtainable only by persons of wealth .

		Mr.
Hunting	PERSON	- ton 's rise to fame as a book-collector is com - paratively recent .

		It began with his purchase of the E. D wight Church library for a million and a quarter dollars , or some such fabulous amount of money ; the next event was his securing of the Beverly Chew collection at a figure said to have been a round half-million ; and soon afterward occurred the famous Hoe sale and Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	's purchase of the first printed book , the
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	, at a price never before paid for a single work , fifty thousand dollars , with other rare works , all amounting to a
quarter-million dollars	MONEY	.

		Judge
Russell Benedict	PERSON	's fine collection of Revolutionary War books and other volumes of great value next fell a prey to Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	- ington 's collectomania ; and , finally , the
Hal	PERSON	- sey library was secured .

		With no new Avorlds to conquer , so far as he can see for the pres - ent , this multimillionaire bibliophile will now have his entire library catalogued by Mr.
George Watson Cole	PERSON	, whose bibliographic skill was notably shown in the Church catalogue , and then he ought to be entitled to a few weeks ' vacation from collecting and railroad - ing in order to become acquainted with his books .

		THE GOVERNMENT AS PUBLISHER Seems to have undergone a change of heart .

		It is mend - ing its ways and stopping some of the waste that has in the past rendered it notorious as the most recklessly uneconomical of printing and distributing establishments .

		Though the congressmen are not yet all sufficiently self -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 restrained in placing their oratorical efforts before the eyes of their constituents , which means a lavish use of the franking privilege and the virtual waste of thousands of pages of printed matter , there has been considerable reform in the practice of sending out docu - ments with no assurance that they will be appreciated by the receivers , or even opened by them .

		The sale of such documents has been greatly increased , the charge being only enough to pay the cost of mechanical produc - tion , which is likewise enough to make them valued and put to a good use when they reach their destination .

		In a single decade the an - nual sales have mounted from
five thousand dollars	MONEY	to forty times that amount .

		As a pub - lisher of periodicals that circulate on a busi - ness basis , the government has built up what would be considered , under private manage - ment , an immense trade .

		Nearly two-score regular publications of this sort are now issued , ranging in price from
twenty-five cents	MONEY	a year , the modest subscription fee asked for '' The National Weather and Crop Bulletin , '' to
five dollars	MONEY	a year , the charge for the patent - office '' Gazette , '' a large and fully illustrated weekly .

		Price-lists of its numerous and ever - increasing publications are circulated by the government , the post-office department aiding greatly in this work of publicity , and com - mendable effort is being made to bring : the particular pamphlet or book or periodical and the person whom it should interest and profit into contact with each other .

		Many valuable treatises , having each sixty or perhaps more pages of print , are obtainable at as low a cost as
five cents	MONEY	apiece ; but -LRB- and this should be carefully heeded -RRB- an enclosure of postage stamps will not secure any of these publica - tions .

		Uncle
Sam	PERSON	does a cash business .

		A FAMILIAR THEME IN LIBRARY LITERATURE is `` The Place of the Library in - . ''

		The blank may be variously filled in .

		but the gen - eral sense remains much the same .

		Sometimes it is '' the community '' that is considered in its relation to the library , at others `` the public school system , '' or `` the educational scheme , '' or it may be .

		with a wider scope , `` modern life . ''

		Dr.
Ernest C. Kichardson	PERSON	.

		Librarian of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, prepared a paper for presentation before the
Interna	LOCATION	- tional Conference of Librarians at
Oxford	LOCATION	, but the war upset the plans of that confer - ence , as it upset so many other plans , and there was no conference , consequently no paper read by Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	or anyone else .

		However , the
Princeton	LOCATION	librarian 's labors were not by any means to be thrown away ; he has printed his essay in a twelve-page pamphlet ; and the title has the good old familiar ring .

		It is this , '' The Place of the Library in the
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The writer is known for his able and learned treatises on pre-historic libraries and other abstruse bibli - othecal subjects , and his systematic treatment of any theme engaging his attention is also known .

		Therefore one is prepared to find him ordering his present discourse under logically arranged headings , and clearing the ground with all needful -LRB- and perhaps some not strictly needful -RRB- definitions as he goes along .

		The university is defined , the various kinds of university students are enumerated , several pages are given to the methods of teaching ; then the library is defined , the nature of the university library is considered and also its methods of imparting instruction , a section is devoted to `` Systematic Staff Teaching : Book Arts and Library Schools , '' and , finally , the place of the library in the university which is what we started out to learn is specifically considered in a page and a half , with a brief '' sum of the matter '' as a wind - up .

		So scholarly a treatment of so scholarly a theme should give pleasure to all scholarly readers .

		CONCERNING PLOTS there has been some re - cent discussion aroused by Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett 's remarks on the subject in his book , '' The Author 's Craft . ''

		He says , for instance , that '' the plot is good when you want to make sure what will happen next .

		Good plots set you anxiously guessing what will happen next . ''

		Cordial assent is given to this by most readers , while others as heartily dissent , maintaining that the best novels are those that hold the interest so completely from page to page that there never enters the reader 's head any thought of what is going to happen next : and the disputants wax warm in support of their respective views , not suspecting that they may be arguing at cross purposes .

		There are , in respect to plots , two very obvious kinds of novels , those with plots and those without them .

		He whose chosen fiction is of the class well represented by '' The Woman in White '' finds his pleasure in being kept `` anxiously guessing what will happen next . ''

		in wonder - ing what will be the next turn in the intricate maze of the plot , and will have but a poor opinion of any story that fails to pique his curiosity in this way .

		On the other hand , the novel-reader whose favorite book is ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	. ''

		with all its looseness of method , its inconsistencies and self-contradictions , its almost total lack of structural coherence , will get no satisfaction from the ingenious and 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	elaborate fabrications of
Wilkie Collins	ORGANIZATION	.

		To him they are nothing but tiresome pieces of mechanism , mere machinery without a spark of life .

		The plotless novel , like `` Wilhelm Meister '' or ''
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	, '' and the novel with a plot , like '' The Leavenworth Case '' or '' The Danvers Jewels , '' are so dissimilar in kind as to be hardly more comparable , one with the other , than an alligator and a tuning - fork .

		THE SHIFTING SANDS OF SIMPLIFIED SPELLING are almost as treacherous as the sliding banks of the
Culebra	LOCATION	Cut .

		When once the mania for re-making our written speech has seized a person , there is no certain limit to its rav - ages .

		Like other passions , the zeal for ortho - graphic reform grows with indulgence , and no two schools of reformers , scarcely any two individual reformers , can agree as to when the curb should be applied .

		The '' Simplified Speling Sosieti '' of
England	LOCATION	has very lately made a further advance in heterodoxy and become the '' Simplifyd Speling Sosyeti , '' and its bi-monthly periodical , '' The Pioneer ov Simplified Speling , '' has been transformed into `` The Pyoneer ov Simplifyd Speling , '' which is no longer '' publisht bi '' said asso - ciation , but `` publisht by '' a curiously un - intentional return to partial sanity .

		Among the '' distingwisht authorz '' of the past whom it proudly and prominently mentions as sup - porters of the reform , it names
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, perhaps having in mind certain numerous passages in `` The Biglow Papers , '' as for instance
Birdofredom Sawin	PERSON	's declara - tion : '' This goin ' ware glory waits ye haint one agreeable feetur , an ' ef it wor n't fer wakin ' snakes , I 'd home agin short meter '' ; or
Hosea Biglow	PERSON	's pronouncement that `` ef any thin 's foolisher and moor dicklus than militerry gloary it is milishy gloary . ''

		A short cut through the acknowledged irregularities and difficulties of our highly composite lan - guage may or may not be desirable ; but , granted this desirability , where is the
Colonel Goethals	PERSON	to engineer the work and safeguard the channel from landslides -LRB- if such safe - guarding be in any wise possible -RRB- ?

		On the whole , the old orthographic route around the other horn of our dilemma -LRB- forgive the mixed metaphor -RRB- is likely to prove the safer .

		BOOK-STANDARDIZATION , not in respect to inner content , but as to outer form , has long been the dream of librarians and others inter - ested in making a given amount of book-space hold a maximum number of books .

		With vol - umes of all sizes to provide with shelves , and with many sizes even in a single branch of lit - erature , the waste space in a large book-stack necessarily amounts to considerable ; and if a congested city library that is planning an extension to its stack has to pay several hun - dred dollars per square foot for the needed additional ground , it becomes a matter of practical economy to figure out a possible scheme whereby all the books on a particular subject may be made to dress their ranks with no marked irregularities of height in any one of those ranks .

		What is the most convenient and in every way desirable book-size for polite literature , for natural science , for art-works , and for the various other departments of printed matter , will probably never be deter - mined by any common agreement ; and so there will always be a place in the reading world , especially in the library world , for such laborious treatises as that which has just come from the pens of the
Herren Doctoren Rudolf	PERSON	and
W. Angermann	PERSON	on `` Normal Book-size and Normal Story-height '' -LRB- `` Nor - malbuchgrosse und Normalgeschosshohe '' -RRB- .

		The problems in least common multiple and greatest common divisor suggested by the mere title can not here be discussed ; but that the whole theme is eminently congenial to the German type of scholarship no one having any acquaintance with that scholarship will doubt .

		Little hope is there of practical results per - haps they are undesirable anyhow from such researches , but it may be well to have the theory of the matter worked out , once for all , with Teutonic thoroughness .

		Harrassowitz , of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, publishes the work .

		THE AUTHORITY OF
SOCRATES	LOCATION	, as a true patriot and eloquent advocate of patriotism , is invoked by '' The Spectator '' in an attempt to bring the '' shirker ' ' to his sense of duty in this hour of his country 's danger .

		It quotes from the '' Crito '' considerable portions of the dialogue between the Laws and the imprisoned sage of
Athens	LOCATION	.

		A few lines will illustrate the remarkable aptness of the citations for the present purposes of
Lord Derby	ORGANIZATION	and the others associated with him in guiding the for - tunes of imperilled
Albion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , in
Jowett	PERSON	's translation , are one or two sentences uttered -LRB- if we may accept
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's word for it -RRB- twenty - three centuries ago , the pronouns '' she '' and '' her '' referring to one 's country : `` And when we are punished by her , whether with imprisonment or stripes , the punishment is to be endured in silence ; and if she lead us to wounds or death in battle , thither we follow as is right ; neither may anyone yield or re - treat or leave his rank , but whether in battle or in a court of law , or in any other place ,

		Whether one side with
Socrates	PERSON	-LRB- speaking here as the Laws -RRB- or with Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	, in respect to a citizen 's obligations in military matters , the undying vitality , the unfailing freshness or modern - ity , of the classics , find in the quoted passage another striking illustration .

		THE POET 'S OPPORTUNITY has come .

		One thousand dollars in gold will be paid '' to the persons who write the best verse on
Newark	LOCATION	, '' announces the editor of '' The Newarker , '' and he thus continues in characteristic vein : '' I say persons and not poets , for everyone can try ; and I say verse and not poetry , for if no poetry is offered then verses will win the prizes .

		No good poetry on
Newark	LOCATION	has yet been written ; the field is quite clear , the bars are down ; the grass is fresh and green , and !

		Indeed , no city in the country , no mat - ter how romantic and full of color its history may seem to be , has a past more full of the episodes about which good poetry may be j woven ; a present more complex , more full of conflicting movements , more deeply touched by human passions : and a future more abounding in possibilities quite epic in their range than this same hitherto unsung

		If any poet of foreign parts | does not believe what I say , let him come and j look and learn . ''

		Finally it is added : `` We j have in the library several dictionaries of j rhymes and many good books on how to tell poetry when you see it : none , alas !

		on how to write it . ''

		The prizes are offered by the Com - mittee of One Hundred on
Newark	LOCATION	's 250th Anniversary , 1666-1916 .

		A FAVORITE PLAN WITH PUBLISHERS , and One that has its undeniable merits , is the issue of books in sets or series that sometimes are logi - | cally formed and hold together by a certain | natural and recognizable affinity , but at other | times have less excuse for their existence and are artificial in their structure .

		But there is always something impressive to the book - buyer in the name and uniform appearance of a set .

		The '' Pigskin Library '' or the '' Five - foot Shelf '' or the `` Great Captains Series '' looks so trim , so imposing even , in its entirety , that many a casual inquirer for a single num - ber is led into the purchase of the whole row , whether or not there is any likelihood of his ever reading the entire series .

		A new `` library , '' in this special sense of the word , is about to appear in
London	LOCATION	and , presumably , in
New York	LOCATION	also , its name to be `` The Museum Library , '' and its contents to embrace anno - tated selections from the chief works of the nineteen British authors whose names so con - spicuously show themselves to anyone entering the reading-room of the British Museum .

		On the circular walls of that famous resort of the studious are inscribed the names of the fol - lowing lights of English literature : Chaucer ,

		To each of these will be devoted a volume containing a biographical study of the author in question , a bibliography of his works , and an annotated selection from his more important writings .

		A twentieth volume will be added for good meas - ure , and will contain noted studies of all the nineteen authors from famous pens .

		The last author on the list will open the series . ''

		PSEUDONYMS THAT CLING , fitting so well that the real name is all but forgotten , are few in comparison with the many that have been assumed and then have fallen into dis - use .

		Such pen-names as
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	,
Anatole France	LOCATION	, are of a permanence such that even the scrupulous cataloguer often consents to recognize them at the expense of the honestly inherited patro - nymic .

		On the other hand , who now would ever think or speak of Thackeray as ''
Michael Angelo Titmarsh	PERSON	, '' or even of Dickens as '' Boz '' ?


Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	is known to thou - sands who would hardly recognize her as ''

J. G. Holland	PERSON	is now never referred to as ''

		Of the foregoing pseudonyms there is one that most persons are inclined to regard as a real name , ``
Anatole France	LOCATION	. ''

		Indeed , even the informed speak habitually of ''
Monsieur Ana	PERSON	- tole

		But the illustrious Frenchman 's father was one

		The elder

		In private life he is
Jacques Ana	LOCATION	- tole Thibault .

		An early desire to become famous , not as an author , but as a saint , is chronicled in the records of his childhood .

		Vying with St.
Simeon Stylites	PERSON	in mortifica - tion of the flesh , he took up his station on top of the kitchen pump , only to be promptly deposed by an unsympathetic maid servant ; and cutting open the seat of a chair to pro- cure himself the wherewithal for a hair shirt , he was ignominiously whipped and put to bed .

		It was fame of a less sanctified though of a not less enviable character that had marked him for her own .

		... A YEAR 'S PROGRESS IN EDUCATION finds its encouraging summing-up in Commissioner
Claxton	PERSON	's annual report for our national De - partment of Education .

		While
Europe	LOCATION	has been busy undoing , so far as possible , the work of centuries of educational and indus - trial and other effort , this country has con - tinued its constructive labors in reclaiming as wide an area as might be of the barren do - main of ignorance .

		Among things achieved in this field Dr.
Claxton	PERSON	enumerates the revival of interest in the kindergarten , greater care for the health of young pupils , longer terms of school activity , better pay for teachers , school-attendance laws in certain States hith - erto without them , the adoption of a larger unit of rural school administration in several States , a raising of the standard of prepara - tion required of teachers in some States and an extension of the means necessary for furnishing this preparation , and , finally , in - creased differentiation of work and adjust - ment of studies in schools of all grades , to rafet the needs of children of varying ability and the vocational life of the community con - cerned .

		This is a far better showing than many a European minister of education will be able to make for the year just closed .

		THE REPORT OF THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDA - TION is not exactly a literary production ; but there are times when literature must take a back seat .

		Two English noblemen once quar - relled as to which of them could write the best verses , and they agreed to refer the dispute to
John Dryden	PERSON	.

		One of them dashed off a few lines on a piece of paper and handed it to
Dryden	PERSON	, who immediately declared that he had won .

		`` But , '' said the other , `` you have not read my verses . ''

		`` It is unnecessary , '' said
Dryden	PERSON	, `` you can not beat this , '' and showed him a check for a hundred pounds .

		Seriously , the
Rockefeller Foundation	ORGANIZATION	seems to be a most laudable and useful affair .

		Dur - ing the past year it contributed about a
million dollars	MONEY	to Belgian Relief , and a mil - lion and a half to other objects .

		It has been regarded with a good deal of suspicion by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; but there does not seem to be any - thing in it to be frightened about .

		In the finances of nations , as they show to-day , even
one hundred million dollars	MONEY	is a mere baga - telle .

		With the provisions against the ac - cumulation of funds , and practical national control of the governing board , there would not appear to be any danger to the
State	ORGANIZATION	in the charity .

		It is well enough to look a gift horse in the mouth ; but when the steed has proved its speed and bottom , skepticism ought to cease .

		The gratitude of the Belgian suffer - ers ought to weigh down any jealousy of this Fund .

		A NEW USE FOR DISCARDED LITERATURE .

		SUCh as old books , useless pamphlets , back numbers of magazines , stale newspapers , is predicted by a German scientist , a certain Professor
Mehner	PERSON	, who gives utterance to some charac - teristically German advice in the columns of the '' Hamburger Nachrichten . ''

		Not only , he urges , should all waste paper be saved as being excellent material for bedding cattle , thus re - leasing as fodder the straw commonly used for this purpose , but , more than that , processes may be discovered that will ere long make paper itself available for fodder ; and thus the very literature that has fed readers ' minds in town and country will soon afterward feed their bodies in the form of beefsteak , roast beef , veal cutlets , milk , butter , and cheese , through the transmuting medium of paper-fed cattle .

		But why not turn the literature di - rectly into nutritious and appetizing food for the table ?

		Surely , nothing is impossible to German efficiency under the present spur of necessity .

		MR.
HENRY JAMES	PERSON	'S DECORATION , only a short half-year after his renunciation of American citizenship in favor of English , must be gratifying to him as proof that his talents are not unappreciated in the land of his long-time residence and recent adoption .

		It will be recalled that
last July	DATE	, when he decided to become a Briton , he explained his action as prompted by a desire to lend such aid and comfort as he could to
England	LOCATION	in her hour of trial by throwing in his lot with
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 her people .

		It was a frank and manly state - ment of his position , and the Order of Merit now given to him by an appreciative sover - eign will certainly not be begrudged him by any of his admirers .

		It is no small honor to wear a decoration that has adorned a Mere - dith in the past and is worn by a
Morley	PERSON	, a
Bryce	LOCATION	, a Trevelyan , and a
Hardy	LOCATION	, in the pres - ent .

		Instituted as a mark of especial distinc - tion for military or naval service , or for notable contributions to art , literature , or science , the order includes at present but eleven civilian members , so that its bestowal on Mr.
James	PERSON	ought to gratify him more than would an invitation to enter the far more crowded company of knights or baronets that is , of course , if he cares for such things at all ; and not to care for them is to be either more or less than human .

		AN INTERCOLLEGIATE MAGAZINE , with the peremptory title of `` Challenge , '' is to make its appearance in the periodical world next month , under the auspices of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity .

		Editorial and business representa - tives will be , or have been , appointed at the leading universities and colleges throughout the country , and the magazine ought to find interested readers at almost every seat of learning and to promote intercollegiate good - fellowship .

		In the words of the prospectus , '' Challenge '' will make its purpose '' to stimu - late the free expression of opinion among American students , to the end that each American college and university may become a conscious and informed intellectual democ - racy . ''

		Great things are evidently hoped for by the courageous young organizers of this promising enterprise : and to youth and en - thusiasm all things are possible .

		COMMUNICATIONS . ''

		WE MODEEXS '' AND THE BROOM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		We are told in your columns of a young poet who says , '' I now see that
Bryant	PERSON	is a symbol of everything that we moderns must sweep aside . ''

		If the young '' poet '' who feels that way reads these columns , let him rest assured that the sooner he turns the broom to the more urgent task of sweep - ing aside his own conceit the better will be the chance that he will one day be an old poet .

		No great school of art , literary or otherwise , has ever yet begun by sweeping away that which has once gained a vital hold on the affections of the people .


Asinius Pollio	PERSON	, a would-be '' modern '' of the expiring Roman Republic and early Empire , tried the broom on the prose style of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		To-day , so far as we know with certainty , we have but a handful of scattered fragments of
Pollio	PERSON	's prose , together with three words of his poetry cited by a Roman grammarian , while the prose of Cicero re - mains an influence of enormous power in the style of all the great literary tongues of the modern Indo-European language family .

		One does not want to be harsh , and yet it needs to be said that all talk of '' sweeping away '' the art of the past in order to make room for the new is merely the whine of incompetence .

		Whence does the new artist propose to sweep the art of the old ?

		Not out of his own system , for it most assuredly is not there to be swept .

		Not out of the affections of the rest of us , for the door of our hearts and minds is not open to the self-appointed literary sweep who comes on that errand .

		Whether the '' We Mod - erns '' school has any real message to the present age remains to be seen , but if so , let it rest assured that the present age has aesthetic and intellectual capacity entirely sufficient to absorb that message without any necessity of emptying out the treas - ures of the past .

		The sensible course for the artist who feels himself an innovator is to offer his goods at their face value and take his chances , but if it has to be one or the other , he will consult his own interests by coming with an apology rather than a broom .

		The very idea of '' sweeping away '' any of the old time classics is puerile .

		They became '' classics '' by going down with their art into the deeper regions of the human soul and attaching themselves to that in man which is not of the moment but of the ages .

		Men and women who occasionally go down into similar depths will meet them there , now one and now another , and hold delightful and profitable converse with them .

		Out of that depth they will never be swept , for into that depth the militant with the broom on his shoulder will never enter .

		THE COLLEGES AND AMERICAN MEDIOCRITY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A great deal is being written at present upon the nurturing of mediocrity in college , and it has been suggested that much better results might be attained if the conscientious college professor did not centre his attention so exclusively upon knock - ing into shape the vast majority of the not especially endowed , but would direct his energies more particularly upon those who show unusual talent or genius , that is , if we are to get any - where that is really worth while in the world of letters and thought .

		That
America	LOCATION	as a whole is deplorably mediocre , not to say degenerate , in matters of taste in litera - ture , music , and art , goes without saying .

		It is , indeed , an age of '' successful mediocrity . ''

		But just how the devoting of especial attention to tal - ent and genius in college is going to right the matter , the present writer fails to see .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	In the first place , those who are peculiarly endowed do not require , as a rule , the special guidance of a professor , who is as likely as not to be as mediocre in his tastes as any of the mass of individuals outside of college .

		I remember , not long ago , to have heard of a professor who told his students that ``
Milton	PERSON	was n't in it with the ' Faithful Shepherdess ' '' ; and of another who held that ''
Robert Browning	PERSON	never said anything 1 that Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	had not said and said better . ''

		The bad taste in this latter statement is in not being able to appreciate each of these poets for his own especial gift of personality , instead of slighting one because he is not exactly like the other .

		Bad taste of this sort , implying narrow - ness of judgment , is just as prevalent among col - lege professors as it is among those outside of college , if not more so .

		Furthermore , such snap judgments help to make the mass outside mediocre , while no student of genuine talent or genius would be in the least affected by them .

		But admitting these instances to be exceptional , and that perfect judgment in matters of taste exists among the majority of college professors , the problematical genius could at best only be saved some wearisome journeys in barren regions of literature or art by the wise warnings of these Elders in the halls of learning .

		It is difficult to see how any amount of special training could increase the genuine creative faculty or the innate good taste of genius , for these are the things with which genius is born , and they grow by their own impetus .

		Did any college professor instruct
Keats	PERSON	that it was the proper thing to admire Greek mythology ?

		On the contrary , the learned critics of the day facetiously spoke of his having - versi - fied Lempriere 's Dictionary .

		It is hard to say where in this worthy dictionary
Keats	PERSON	could have found the masterly interpretation of Greek myth which he has put into '' Hyperion . ''

		What talent or genius really needs is apprecia - tion and support after it has left the protecting arms of the Alma Mater .

		Where will it find such appreciation and sup - port now ?

		The publishers are not at all inter - ested in whether a writer is a genius or not .

		They want something that will sell ; and having a mediocre public to deal with , and being also medi - ocre themselves , every trained mediocrity that comes out of college stands a better chance of being heard than the one genius .

		Music publish - ers will even refuse to look at compositions which they are told show unusual originality .

		Again , if the newspaper or magazine editor wants a critic , he asks the candidate , not if he is capable of forming luminous and broad-minded judgments upon the books he is to review , but ~ if he is a trained college man .

		Therefore , criticism in this country is for the most part a farce , for the trained young college man , who is only that and nothing more , has neither had sufficient expe - rience of life nor done enough individual reading to form sound judgments .

		He starts in with a handful of courses in literature , in each of which he has read selected masterpieces , perhaps having specialized in one man for a degree , and with a few rules about style ; then tries to size up every - body according to the standards he has been taught .

		The only criticism worth anything is that which can perceive the power and beauty of the forward-looking which transcends past standards , and this requires a genius for criticism or appre - ciation .

		Woe to the genius who falls into the clutches of this young critic !

		If the genius happens to be so lucky ad to find a publisher with the strength of mind to publish anything which is not exactly like everything else published by everybody else , that is , which is not in the prevailing style , he will find himself doomed by the trained young critic , who will probably confess with pride and exaltation that he finds this new writer '' obscure . ''

		Nothing seals the fate of a genius so effectually as to have mediocrity say it can not understand him .

		Suppose , by any possible chance the publisher or the editor gets hold of a genius in critical work , and this benighted genius flatters himself that after a few years of experience he will be able to command a better price for his labors .

		He will eventually learn his mistake , for he will find him - self dismissed in favor of the cheap young trained college man .

		So the college training plays into the hands of the mercenary publisher .

		The training counts for everything , genius and experience for nothing .

		Perhaps it is a temperamental weakness in us Americans that we seem to take the utmost pride in writing ourselves down stupid .

		Noble and beautiful music we call '' heavy '' ; psychological drama , in which gripping problems are powerfully portrayed , we call '' high-browed . ''

		We must have something simply amusing .

		Philosophy , or poetry enriched by philosophical truth , is quite too pro- found for our mean little brains to grasp .

		And we are proud of it , and anyone who says he likes these things is either a bogie or a poseur .

		It sometimes looks as if stories written in slang phraseology , moving pictures , and Victrola per - formances would run out all other forms of litera - ture , drama , and music .

		We must have things to read in which we need not be seriously interested .

		We must have '' shows '' that do not appeal to our sense of the artistic , but to our delight in perfectly obvious mechanical contrivances .

		We must have twice-baked music in bits because we get fidgety if we are obliged to sit through a whole concert or opera .

		The real problem , then , with which the college professor has to deal is how to educate mediocrity so that , instead of being so desperately in love with itself , it will aspire to an appreciation of some - thing better than itself , or , at least , different from itself .

		The genius , if he is to thrive , must have his appreciators ; but the question is , how in an age where a premium is put upon training as against innate intellectual superiority can he find them ?

		for it is a condition of things in which he is more likely to be scorned as a freak than appreciated .

		It is not for me to suggest to college professors how this problem is to be met .

		I suspect it is more of a social or moral problem than a purely intellectual one .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 63 It is certainly mixed up with the ideal of democ - racy , which revolts against the idea of innate superiority , and welcomes the paramountcy of training , because it posits equal capabilities in everyone .

		Once arriving at this point , it is an easy step for mediocrity to regard itself as the superior of genius .

		Can it be that we like to read stories in which we can not be seriously interested because we like to feel superior to the writer ; that we like '' movies '' because enthusiasm for the actors and the author are put on an impersonal plane , and we as persons can thus feel superior ?

		The same with the Victrola , our superiority is safely isolated by the mechanical contrivances .

		And how much we feel like super-men and super-women , when we candidly admit we do not enjoy '' heavy '' -LRB- that is grand and noble -RRB- music , or '' high brow '' plays !

		In fact , I think
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	somewhere expresses approval of such an attitude of mind .

		Perhaps it will dawn upon a democratic world some day that there is no greater joy possi - ble than that of the appreciation and enthusiasm for great and beautiful and nobly powerful things .

		The two highest functions of the human mind are the one which is capable of creating beauty and the one which is capable of appreciating beauty .

		Every human being has the power innate within him to create beauty in some form , not neces - sarily art .

		It may be moral beauty , a beauty of service , mechanical beauty , etc. .

		In this sense there is no mediocrity .

		Every human being has also latent within him the power to appreciate beauty .

		Developed to its highest capacity this power is almost a more won - derful gift than genius itself , or rather , it be - comes a genius for sympathy and enthusiasm for all that is great in art , noble in thought , ideal in morals , marvellous in science .

		Its kingdom is wider than that of genius .

		There comes with it a joy which is perhaps quite equal to the ecstasy of the creator in art .

		So-called mediocrity , then , when it leaves col - lege should be able to look forward to a time when it can say , like Cleon , '' I have not chanted verse like Homer , no Xor swept string like Terpander , no nor carved And painted men like Phidias and his friend : I am not great as they are point by point .

		But I have entered into sympathy With these four , running these into one soul , Who , separate , ignored each other 's art .

		Say , is it nothing that I know them all ! ''

		To which might be replied : '' Yea , verily , so well hast thou done that thou shalt sit with Homer and Terpander and Phidias on the slopes of Parnassus . ''

		On the other hand , the genius must be modest .

		His superiority is only in one direction .

		He cre - ates , it is true , a beauty of the imagination ; but there are others who create a beauty of the mind , or a beauty of the spirit .

		And above all , there are those , his greatest need , who dwell in the land of sympathy and appreciation .

		But this is unnecessary advice to the true genius in any department of effort , for it is only success - fully trained mediocrity , as at present constituted , which is unbearablv conceited .

		If the college professor is able to convince his students that what the world , and
America	LOCATION	in par - ticular , needs is a fine frenzy of enthusiasm , that such appreciation is as much to be honored as genius itself ; and also if he can convince them of the silliness of congratulating themselves upon their own weak brain power often the result of sheer laziness or lack of aspiration , he will be paving the way for the transformation of medioc - rity into a genius for the highest appreciation in relation to the creators of distinguished beauty .

		Ages of development have gone to the evolution of the human brain .

		It is true that intuition and emotion have probably remained almost pristinely embryonic during this process , and it is time to pay attention to these other faculties of the human spirit .

		Perhaps by dancing we may be bringing our emotions to a point where they may begin a healthy development .

		Perhaps psychology will open out the ' way whereby our intuitions may grow ; but we must not let our last gain make our first gain futile , for we are creatures of mind as well as of heart and soul .

		THE WORD `` UXTEXTED '' IN `` KING LEAR . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the generally accepted interpretation of a pas - sage in `` King Lear '' -LRB- I , 4,307 ,
Rolfe	PERSON	's edition -RRB- , there is a striking instance of what Professor Lid - dell has well called `` botching Shakspere . ''

		Lear , in cursing
Goneril	LOCATION	, says : '' Th ' untented wound - ings of a father 's curse
Pierce	PERSON	every sense about thee ! ''

		The word '' untented , '' as here used , has never been satisfactorily explained by either com - mentator or lexicographer .

		Schmidt and almost all editors of this play say that a '' tent '' is '' a probe for searching a wound '' and that `` untented '' means '' not to be probed by a tent ; incurable . ''

		Some editors go a little further and say a tent is '' a roll of lint , or other material , used in searching a wound . ''

		Dyce says that `` untented woundings '' are '' wounds not yet treated or so severe and deep that they will not admit of being treated by the insertion of the surgeon 's tent , '' and that '' to tent '' means '' to search with a tent , to probe . ''


Phin	PERSON	adds `` unsearchable '' to the other definitions of '' untented '' ; and
Hudson	PERSON	's gloss is : '' too deep to be probed . ''

		The dictionaries are no nearer the truth than the commentators .

		Worcester defines the word as '' not tented , not having a tent applied '' ;
Ogilvie	PERSON	's Impe - rial Dictionary as '' not having a medical tent applied ; hence , not having the pain lessened '' ;
Johnson	PERSON	's as '' having no medicaments applied '' ; the Encyclopedic Dictionary adds '' not dressed '' to the other definitions ; and so on .

		The medical knowledge of Skeat 's Etymological Dictionary is no better , for there we find : '' Tent , a roll of lint used to dilate a wound .

		See Nares .

		Properly a probe ; the verb to tent is used for to probe . ''

		The eighteenth century editors also found the passage difficult of explanation .

		Pope changed '' untented '' to '' untender , '' thus following one of the Quartos .

		Theobald , quoted by
Furness	ORGANIZATION	, said it 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	meant '' a wounding of such a sharp , inveterate nature that nothing shall be able to tent it , i. e. search the bottom , and help in the cure of it . ''

		Steevens , also quoted by
Furness	PERSON	, missing the sig - nificance of
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	's explanation , says that '' un - tented woundings may possibly signify such wounds as will not admit of having a tent put into them . ''


W. J. Craig	PERSON	, in his excellent edition of the play , after a careful consideration of the passage in question , accepts
Nares	ORGANIZATION	's explanation : '' Unap - peased , not put into a way of cure as a wound is , when a surgeon has put a tent into it . ''

		The most surprising explanation of all , as coming from a physician , is that of Dr.
Bucknill	PERSON	, who says : '' Untented appears to mean , ' not to be tented , ' wounds the bottom of which is not to be reached . ''

		All these interpreters have forgotten that the term '' tent '' was applied not only to a probe , for the purpose of searching a wound , but also to a piece of some medicated material , lint or sponge , intro - duced into an abscess cavity for the purpose of stimulating healing ; to stimulating ointments used in the healing of wounds ; and to a cylindrical roll of some absorbent material , usually of lint , in - troduced into wounds and retained there for the purpose of absorbing the acrid and purulent dis - charges of the abscess or fistula .

		In other words , a tent is what is now commonly called a drain , and '' untented '' in accordance with a common
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan usage means '' undrainable , not capable of being emptied of its purulent contents , not ceas - ing to discharge pus . ''

		Stated medically ,
Lear	PERSON	is cursing
Goneril	LOCATION	with chronic purulent ulcers affect - ing all her organs of feeling .

		This is certainly far more vivid than wounds that are too small or too deep or too sharp to admit of the introduction of a probe or tent or medicament .

		Besides , such wounds do not exist .

		Even a superficial examination of any medical work of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries will suffice to confirm our definition .

		The curious reader may consult
Clowes	PERSON	's '' Treatise on Gunshot Wounds , ''

		We can not , in concluding , refrain from quoting a very inter - esting passage , illustrating the use of the word '' tent , '' in '' The Muse 's Looking Glass , '' a play by
Randolph	PERSON	-LRB- 1638 -RRB- : '' The land wants such As dare with vigour execute her laws ; Her fester 'd mem - bers must be lanc 'd and tented . ''

		SHAKESPEARE 'S DRAMATIC DIRECTNESS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am one who did notice the point of fact your correspondent in a recent number of THE DIAL brings forward as one usually ignored by editors , concerning the minor incident in
Plutarch	LOCATION	used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	with his transfiguring touch in '' Coriolanus , '' I , ix , 94ff .

		To make Coriolanus forget the name while remembering the deed of a benefactor , at a time when most men would be full only of themselves , is one of those multitudinous trifles of invention that speak eloquently of the characterizing and humanizing genius of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In my brief notes on the '' cunning '' of '' Shake - speare 's little changes '' and his '' human touch , quite beyond Plutarch '' in this passage -LRB- `` First Folio Edition '' of `` Coriolanus , '' pp. 174-5 , 178-9 -RRB- , I also brought to bear upon these changes another little fact not noticed by your correspondent , the fact that the poet keeps back until now the faint - ness mentioned by
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, earlier , before the close of the battle : '' Then they prayed Martius that he would retire to the campe , because they sawe he was able to doe no more , he was alreadie so wearied with the great woundes he had upon him . ''

		Shakespeare dramatizes here at one clear and rapid stroke the historical , physical , and psycho - logical facts upon which he builds the climax of this scene and the stage mechanics of its exeunt .

		The Roman general , instantly granting the boon just asked for the benefactor , gives the order '' deliver him , Titus . ''

		To carry out the order , Titus asks `` Martius , his name ? ''

		This question brings out the reply : '' By
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, forgot : I am wearie , yea , my Memorie is tyr 'd : Have we no wine here ? ''

		His general 's comment is clear and direct .

		It reinforces this explanation by
Corio	PERSON	- lanus that he forgot because his very capacity to remember within his wounded head was faint for loss of blood .

		Cominius notices that the blood has ceased to flow , is drying , a token of its exhaustion implying the need of care and nourishment .

		So he says , '' The bloud upon your Visage dryes , 't is time It should be lookt too : come . ''

		And thus they go off stage .

		The trouble with a more involved and round - about explanation of the dramatic fitness of this climax and this exeunt is that it falsifies them .

		It is against the dramatic sincerity of the scene and the characters and the direct and sufficient explana - tion elaborately to suppose that Coriolanus forgot , as your correspondent puts it , because he scorned to remember a name that '' would have suggested '' his benefactor 's '' plebeian origin . ''

		If this were designed by Shakespeare he had the skill to make it plain .

		Why did he take pains rather to reinforce the explanation offered ?

		Why should a dramatist who is sure of touch and master of his purpose go about to make it dark and double ?

		Remember , too , that he prepared earlier for a special loss of blood in the head .

		This dauntless hero took his wounds headlong , confronting the foe .

		His face was scarcely recognizable in I , vi .

		It appears as if it were flayed .

		It needs to be verified as his by the sound of his voice .

		In the present scene , he says that when he has washed and his '' face is f aire '' those about him may be enabled to perceive whether he blushes at their praise or no .

		The assertion remains to be proved , moreover , that merely because the benefactor is poor he is therefore a plebeian .

		What sequitur is there in that for an audience ?

		What sequitur is there in that for a patrician soul
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 65 like that of Coriolanus , who is so un-American , shall we say ?

		at least so not at all up to date as in this very scene to despise a mercenary measure - ment of his own worth ?

		The idealistic scorn of the material coming out in the hero 's characteristic refusal to '' take a Bribe to pay my Sword '' shines rather in an inten - tionally enhancing light because the Volscian bene - factor whom he remembers is poor of purse and noble of nature .

		There was nothing to be got by the request he makes for him .

		Shakespeare selects from
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	for special mention here only those facts about him that suit and serve the scene .

		The other details , that he had been rich -LRB- therefore was not a plebeian we could with more reason suppose if it were worth while to go into that irrelevancy -RRB- and was now a slave of war all these details were simply needless or inconspicuously implied in the statement of Coriolanus that he once lay at his house , '' He us 'd me kindly , He cry 'd to me : I saw him Prisoner ; But then
Aufidius	PERSON	was within my view , And wrath o'rewhelm 'd my pittie : I request you to give my poore Host freedome . ''

		In this scene , evidently , sympathy with the nobleness of the hero is all Shakespeare wants from his audience .

		Later , when he sits in gold and when his friendliness with Volscians against his country is to his discredit , there is there as here no taint of mere money return suffered to blacken him .

		A BACONIAN TO THE DEFENCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The authorship of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	plays is undoubtedly the greatest of literary problems , and it can not be belittled by an article such as the review in your columns by Mr.
Samuel A. Tannen	PERSON	- baum , of Mr.
James P. Baxter	PERSON	's solid work on the question .

		The reviewer seems to have made a special study of the facts connected with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's applica - tion for a coat of arms , and he is enabled to correct Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	on one or two minor points regarding the application .

		His triumphant manner of doing this might lead anyone to suppose that he believed he had thereby established his hero 's claim to the authorship of the plays .

		Another point on which Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	lays special stress is the praise of the Shakespeare works by various con - temporary writers .

		In using this argument he quite ignores the fact that none of these writers , with possibly one exception , identifies the author with the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor , and this possible excep - tion is by no means a clear exception .

		The phrase '' our English Terence '' suggests a pseudonym , if the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's reasoning would be paralleled by stringing together a number of passages in praise of
George Eliot	PERSON	's novels , and proceeding to argue that the author of the novels must have been a man of that name .

		Dr.
Charles William Wallace	PERSON	, who some few years ago discovered in the
Record Office	ORGANIZATION	in Lon - don the document containing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's An - swer to : Interrogatories in a petty lawsuit in which he was a witness , unwittingly proved con - clusively that the actor was unable to write , be - cause his name is written by a law clerk in law script , and the deponent made his mark beneath the signature .

		Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	is greatly displeased with Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	for distinguishing between the actor 's name ,
Shakspere	LOCATION	, and the author 's pseudonym , Shakespeare or Shake-speare ; but Mr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum 's displeasure does not alter the fact that the difference does exist , and it exists quite as clearly as the difference between
Tannenbaum	PERSON	and
Rosen	PERSON	- baum .

		The article contains the usual sneering sugges - tion that all Baconians are insane , though it is doubtful whether Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	would have dared to say this of von Bismarck if he had been in
Germany	LOCATION	during the heyday of the Chancellor 's P wer '
E. BASIL LUPTON	PERSON	.

		A FESTAL WORD ABOUT DIPHTHONGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Always , when the follower of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's `` Art of Controversy '' finds himself with no hole to hide in , his procedure is that of the cuttle - fish the beclouding of clear water with much ink .

		So far has Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	carried the process that it is needful to restate the issues he has so confused .

		These are : '' Our present letters do not show the diphthon - gal characters of ch , sh , ng , th and zh . ''

		-LRB- ''
Essen	LOCATION	- tials of English Speech , '' by
Frank H. Vizetelly	PERSON	, page 290 . -RRB-

		I take it this means that the sounds indicated by the italicized letters were diphthongal in Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's best understanding of the subject at the time the book was written . ''

		Every one of the great dictionaries has decided that the sound of these letters -LSB- those italicized above -RSB- is diphthongal . ''

		-LRB- Ibid , page 291 . -RRB-

		This seems to state in plain language that all the great dictionaries actually set forth that the sound of these letters is diphthongal .

		These are the points at issue , these and these alone .

		In contradiction of Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's state - ments I arrayed against him every dictionary .

		Not daring and he dares much to deny their authority , he preserves a brilliant silence on both the points at issue , which must be taken as a tacit confession that he is wrong .

		This settles the con - troversy .

		It only remains for him to correct his book , quite useful in several other respects , in the light of the understanding that , I am sure , once imparted , will slowly dawn upon him surely , but slowly .

		His letter to THE DIAL of
Dec. 9 , 1915	DATE	, Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	opened by observing of his book that his `` remarks .

		.

		were written to bring out the fact that .

		.

		the diphthongal characters of the digraphs ch , ng , sh , th , and zh , would be better indicated by ligatured symbols than by plain letters . ''

		Having arrayed against this restatement of the diphthongal characters of all these digraphs , except ch , every 66 -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	phonetic authority , quoting volume and page , it pleases me to find him citing not one authority against that array in his letter of
Jan. 6 , 1916	DATE	, not one .

		As he has cited pretty nearly everything else he could think of which does not bear directly upon this point , I take it that he is on his dilatory way to conviction that he is wrong .

		And he is grotesquely wrong .

		For he has chosen the use of digraphs to represent elementary sounds as an excellence of the alphabet he is apologizing for , when it is a weakness .

		It may well pray to be defended from such a friend .

		This , too , will eventually come to him .

		A paragraph , '' -LRB- 4 -RRB- , '' in his latest letter requires attention as bearing upon the main question and not upon matter wholly extraneous .

		In it Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	says : '' nowhere in my book do I indi - vidually say ' most phoneticists analyze this sound -LSB- that of ch -RSB- as a combination of t and sh , ' as Mr.
Rice	PERSON	asserts .

		It is true that the words appear upon page 291 of the book , but there they are quoted from the edition of '
Webster	PERSON	's
Interna	LOCATION	- tional Dictionary . ' ''

		The italics are the good Doctor 's ; as usual when he italicizes , it is to shout something that he ought not to whisper .

		Here the book follows the quotation from
Webster	PERSON	with a sentence of his own , '' This being the case , let us be guided by the expert phonetist . '' ''

		This being the case , '' it might seem to those with under - standing , can mean only that Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	does individually say what his letter with equal explicit - ness denies he has said individually , while the words '' expert phonetist '' mean nothing more or less than that the authority quoted is , in his indi - vidual opinion , an authority which has his indi - vidual endorsement .

		Possibly , however , judging by other positions he has taken , his categorical statement that the case is '' this '' signifies that he individually believes it different .

		What his per - sonal views on the subject of ch chance to be at this moment , provided he has any , is a matter for smiling conjecture .

		Only less confusing are Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's partial quotations from three dictionaries , ignoring five others , regarding the meaning of the single word diphthong .

		No one doubts that the words conso - nantal diphthong mean '' a blending of two conso - nants in one syllable . ''

		That is not the point in issue ; the noun without its modifying adjective means only '' a blending of two vowels in one syllable . ''

		The use of the noun and adjective in the definition from the '' New English Dictionary , '' quoted in parenthesis , emphasizes the point ; so do the two instances of use brought forward to support it .

		This is no less true of the citations from the other two dictionaries .

		If Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	had quoted the instances of use or had allowed their weight to enter his understanding , he might have admitted the correctness of my position .

		He might , I say ; there is nothing in his controversial method to make me think he would .

		As for the rest , it is without the issues .

		Where I have been corrected in errors ` of fact when the haste of an instant reply compelled my reliance upon impressions rather than demonstrable facts , I am thankful , as I have been for correction throughout life ; these errors , however minor , I shall not have to repeat or ignore by way of prov - ing my possession of understanding .

		VAEIANTS IN A CHRISTMAS FOLK-SONG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
January 6	DATE	number of THE DIAL one of your correspondents , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	, quotes '' The Twelve Days of Christmas '' at length .

		He says the version was given him orally and that he has never seen it in print .

		By a curious coincidence these verses were published as a children 's game by Mr.
George E. Johnson	PERSON	in the
December	DATE	-LRB-
1915	DATE	-RRB- number of '' Something to Do , '' an excellent new juvenile magazine .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	gives a slightly varying version which it is interesting to compare with Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford 's .

		His final stanza is : '' The twelfth day of
Christmas	DATE	, my true love sent to me , Twelve lords a-leaping , eleven ladies dancing , ten pipers piping , Nine drummers drumming , eight maids a-milking , seven swans a-swimming , Six geese a-laying , five gold rings , four colly birds , three French hens , Two turtle doves , and a partridge in a pear tree . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's '' twelve lords a-leaping '' are not so absurd with '' eleven ladies dancing , ten pipers piping , and nine drummers drumming . ''

		Indeed , it seems quite natural behavior under the circum - stances !

		It is amusing to note how the oral transmission has changed the '' four colly birds '' of the one verse into the '' four colored balls '' of Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford 's , and even the '' six geese a-laying '' into '' six chests of linen . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 67 Socks .

		THE VERSE OF
THK	ORGANIZATION	BROXTE SISTERS .

		* There was a time in Victorian days when readers slaked their thirst for an innocent melodrama with the novels of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, when her hysterical rhetoric , the plaintive heroines , and their black-browed suitors -LRB- of mysterious past -RRB- moved readers to strange and deep emotions .

		Those days are gone , and with them the peculiar thrill .

		The demoniac laughter of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' and the nun-like spectre of `` Villette '' stir us no longer , or , at most , move us to irreverent though indulgent mirth .

		And yet , despite the changes of literary fashion , there has been no decline in the
Bronte	PERSON	' stock .

		The age which allows
George Eliot	PERSON	to moulder on forgotten shelf has preserved the fame of
Charlotte	LOCATION	and practically created the fame of
Emily Bronte	PERSON	.

		Volume after volume about them issues from the press .

		Their works are published in sumptuous '' library editions '' ; their lives are written by Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	,
M. Dimnet	PERSON	.

		and
Miss Sinclair	LOCATION	; there is a ''
Bronte Society	ORGANIZATION	, '' with its own series of publications : the microscopic romances , in the fabrication of which the sis - ters passed away a lonely hour of girlhood , fetch magnificent sums in auction-rooms ; the moors of
Yorkshire	LOCATION	have become '' the
Bronte	PERSON	country '' ; and now Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, gathering up all their verse , puts forth a volume entitled '' The Bronte Poems . ''

		The Brontes , in a word , have become a fad .

		They have entered a sphere with
Chatterton	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	, where interest in an au - thor 's literary work merges into a larger but perhaps less legitimate interest in his whole story , his life and environment , and mere literature is viewed in the light of the whole .

		The explanation is simple enough .

		The
Bronte	PERSON	story challenges the imagination .

		It is as though the spirit of
Byron	PERSON	had mingled with that of
Miss Alcott	PERSON	, and then projected itself against the bleak background of the northern moorland .

		There is a bitter realism in the story at times , suggestive of Balzac or even of Zola , but the whole is softened by the spirit of girlhood and is solemnized by the atmosphere of a brooding fate .

		To much of this
Emily Bronte	PERSON	' gave enduring expression in '' `` Wuthering Heights '' crudely , to be sure , but with amazing power .


Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, forgetting her pedagogic primness , expresses it at moments , but never fully .

New York	LOCATION	: G. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		the complete revelation of it , you must know the
Bronte	PERSON	story .

		Now it is for its connection with this story that most readers will open Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's reissue of the poems .

		They are by no means new to the world .

		The sisters as every one knows put forth their first volume of verse in
1846	DATE	; the verse has been reissued in various forms , and additions to it have appeared at various times .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, who has had access to the
Bronte	LOCATION	papers , can add but little that is new : six poems by
Charlotte	LOCATION	, two by
Emily	PERSON	, and five by
Anne	PERSON	.

		This is hardly an event in literary history , for the poems now first published contain nothing particularly significant , and a perusal of the entire volume will but remind the average reader that the Brontes have become very old-fashioned .

		The poems , with one or two notable exceptions , derive their interest not so much from their intrinsic merits as from the significance lent them by the circumstances out of which they
spring	DATE	.

		The Brontes were all , by common inheri - tance , versifiers ; none of them was a poet , though Emily and , at times ,
Anne	PERSON	produced poems .

		The lack which is felt throughout the work of them all is that of discipline .

		There is surely some subtle hereditary relation be - tween the vice of BranwelTs life and the vice of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's style .

		In the poems , as in the novels , emotion is everywhere astir , but it is crude , frequently callow , self-conscious , wholly uncontrolled , and always plunging into language , wreaking itself upon expres - sion , set down hurriedly in all its rawness , never , by any chance , recollected in tranquil - lity .

		With the Brontes , to experience an emo - tion is to express it .

		They consume no smoke , and therefore a collection of their verse must always remain a somewhat murky record of their riot of emotionalism .

		After reading them for a while one longs for the profes - sional touch again , and turns to Landor or to Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	, to Hellenism and discipline and an experienced artist 's control of technique .

		The atmosphere may be colder , but it is clearer .

		The nocturnes and etudes of the Brontes are passionate and moving , but the performer is for ever striking a false note .

		Emily , for example , can write about the stars in a really beautiful and affecting way : '' I turned me to the pillow then To call back night , and see Your worlds of solemn light again Throb with my heart and me . ''

		She could write that , and then she could add : '' The curtains swayed , the wakened flies Were murmuring round my room , 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	Imprisoned there till I should rise , And give them leave to roam . ''

		The same slovenliness of technique , the same passion spoiled by rawness , appear in the poems of
Charlotte	LOCATION	.

		Her lyric , '' He Saw My Heart 's Woe , '' now printed for the first time , might come straight from the most lurid pages of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' : '' Idolater I kneeled to an idol cut in rock , I might have slashed my flesh and drawn my heart 's best blood , The Granite God had felt no tenderness , no shock , My Baal had not seen nor heard nor under - stood . ''

		There are the diction and the emotions with which the pen of Jane once acquainted us ; you may find it in your heart to wish the pas - sage tempered down , but you can not deny its passion and then , suddenly , all sinks into prose and bathos : '' Now Heaven heal the wound which I still deeply feel ; Thy glorious hosts look not in scorn on our poor race ; Thy King eternal doth not iron judgment deal On suffering worms who seek forgiveness , comfort , grace . ''

		Of all the
Bronte	PERSON	group the one who came nearest to self-restraint was
Anne	PERSON	.

		She , the gentlest of them all , craves direction and con - trol , finds it in her Christian faith , and sub - mits herself to the higher power .

		Her verse is prevailingly religious , her moods less stormy than
Emily	PERSON	's , her notes few and sim - ple , reminiscent of eighteenth century hym - nals and , in particular , of the poetry of
William Cowper	PERSON	.

		Her verses to the memory of that poet are something more than a young girl 's sweet tribute to a favorite ; they are instinct with the very spirit which she ad - mires in her master , and it is pleasant to feel that among all the verses written in his honor none would have gratified the recluse of
Olney	ORGANIZATION	more than these .

		It is the spirit of
Cowper	PERSON	, moreover , that moves in what is almost cer - tainly the best poem she ever wrote , the '' Prayer , '' which ends , '' I can not say my faith is strong , I dare not hope my love is great ; But strength and love to thee belong ; Oh , do not leave me desolate . ''

		I know I owe my all to thee ; Oh , take the heart I can not give !

		Do thou my strength my Saviour be , And make me to thy glory live ! ''

		If the name of
Anne Bronte	PERSON	is to live in verse , it must , as she foresaw , be in some such simple way as this .

		For verses such as
Anne Bronte	PERSON	's our free - thinking times will have but little use ; they will prefer those of
Emily	LOCATION	, for there is more resistance in her and therefore more passion .

		The abiding gloom of her poetry will seem natural enough to those who know her life - history ; but it is always to be remembered that the despair which broods over poems springs not so much from the fear of physical suffering , which was hers in large measure , as from a certain horror at the misery of the general human lot .

		In her powerful lyric , '' How Clear She Shines , '' she says : '' The world is going ; dark world , adieu !

		Grim world , conceal thee till the day ; The heart thou canst not all subdue Must still resist , if thou delay ! ''

		While gazing on the stars that glow Above me in that stormless sea , I long to hope that all the woe Creation knows is held in thee ! ''

		This is the essential mood in her verse , this rather than the more pagan tone of the fol - lowing poem -LRB- given in its entirety -RRB- : '' One pause upon the brink of life , Before it breaks in headlong strife , Upon its downward road ; One insight through the waters clear , Before their pictures disappear In the fierce foaming flood . ''

		But there was one experience which shat - tered
Emily	PERSON	's life-long sadness , and lifted her to a plane of solemn joy , and that experience was death .

		In her last lines , `` No Coward Soul Is Mine , '' she transcended herself , and lifted her dying voice in a paean of faith from which the note of desperation has been banished by the calmness of eternity ; and , though the verses have been hackneyed in every anthology and in every essay on her work , they must be quoted once again as a measure of all that was best in her and as gathering into one piercing ray all the broken lights of her earlier verse .

		The last two stanzas of this poem are these : '' Though earth and man were gone , And suns and universes ceased to be , And Thou wert left alone , Every existence would exist in Thee . ''

		There is not room for Death , Nor atom that his might could render void : Thou Thou art being and breath , And what Thou art may never be destroyed . ''

		That is an utterance destined to survive .

		In the opinion of the present writer it is even destined to survive that popular creed of the present hour in which it is asserted , with more force than conviction , that man is the master of his fate and the captain of his soul .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 69 Thus the poetry of the Brontes is prevail - ingly meditative .

		Their function is contem - plation , not creation .

		To them the poet is not a maker of images , a teller of tales , a dreamer of dreams , or even the idle singer of an empty day .

		Their concern is ever with the commonplaces of the human heart , its fears , its faith , its sorrows and its plaintive hopes .

		None of the Brontes ever escapes from the prison-house of self , and the constant recur - rence of such words as '' dungeon '' and '' thrall '' is significant of a profound defect in their poetry , self - absorption .

		This lack is the more remarkable in three poets who were also novelists .

		You will search their volume in vain for any evidence of that shaping power of the imagination which conceived the fabric of '' Wuthering Heights '' or for any of that dramatic vision which created
Paulina	LOCATION	or
Adele	ORGANIZATION	.

		And because of this lack of imagi - nation for such in a very profound sense it is the poetry of the Brontes will always be the possession of a very few , and will remain a body of verse interesting chiefly as a lyric commentary on a group of lives , which , in their sadness , their isolation , and their sense of powers half-realized , mingle the gentle with the heroic and bring , at times , the actual very near to the high levels of tragedy .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		praisal of the efforts of sundry European peoples in the same direction , and concludes with a sketch of the experiments of the kind which have been , and are being , made in
North and South America	LOCATION	.

		So far as geo - graphical range is concerned , the one striking omission appears to be the English self - governing colonies .

		It would seem that in any account of the evolution of liberty under law the constitutional systems of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and
South Africa	LOCATION	should be accorded a not inconspicuous place .

		No one of these names , however , even appears in the index of the present volume , although practically every Latin American country is there mentioned .

		It was to be expected that the history of the relations of government and liberty in
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	would be recorded quickly .

		The two chapters devoted to the subject comprise less than one-eleventh of the book , and are taken up chiefly with summaries of recent political movements in
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		It is the author 's opinion that in the two continents mentioned the best efforts to harmonize government and liberty are those which have been made in the
Moham	LOCATION	- medan states , and that `` had the subjects of these states been wholly Mohammedans by their own choice and conviction it is not im - possible that these states might have gone much farther in this great work than they have . ''

		The hope is expressed that the Turks may yet attain the desired reconciliation .

		In describing the efforts of
Europe	LOCATION	to har - monize government and liberty , the author naturally follows the order of chronology , beginning with the Greeks and the Romans and moving on to the establishment of the constitutional systems at present operative in the various states .

		Of the Greeks he is obliged to say that , on account of their con - founding the state with government and their recognition of no sphere of individual immunity against governmental power , they did not even perceive with any degree of clearness that there was a problem of the kind here being considered .

		`` With regard to the Romans , it is pointed out that very early , in the drawing up of the
Twelve Tables	LOCATION	, there was the most complete solution of the prob - lem of reconciliation which the world to that time had produced , but that in the subsequent history of the Republic , and especially of the Empire , the good beginning that had been made was not followed up .

		It is maintained that , contrary to a widely prevalent impres - sion , in the political arrangements of the primitive Germans -LRB- as described by Tacitus -RRB- there appears no approach to a solution of the 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	problem , and that in the Germanic states of the earlier Middle Ages there was scarcely more approach to it , save in
Anglo-Saxon Britain	LOCATION	, and there only in the earliest days .

		A detailed review of the history of the Middle Ages fails to disclose the condition sought ; and a chapter on the growth of the national monarchies in the fifteenth , six - teenth , and seventeenth centuries demon - strates that in this great era liberty , even more completely than formerly , was sacri - ficed to government .

		In a somewhat prolonged , survey of `` the Revolutions '' beginning with the English Civil War in the seven - teenth century and closing with the inaugu - ration of constitutionalism in
Russia	LOCATION	a decade ago it is maintained that , while in this period fairly adequate safeguards of the indi - vidual were established as against the execu - tive , none of consequence were created as against the legislature .

		And the author pauses to expound the idea that a legislature may be just as despotic and as oppressive as a monarch can ever be .

		A legislature , he says , can be depended on to protect the indi - vidual `` only where the suffrage is limited to men of intelligence , character , and means , and eligibility to a seat in the legislative body is conditioned upon the same qualities .

		Where universal suf - frage is the source of legislative mandate the legislative authority is a far more consummate despot than any king or prince has ever shown himself to be .

		Against such a legislature the indi - vidual is in the most helpless condition possible .

		It has rarely any sense of justice and is almost never influenced by considerations of mercy .

		It readily becomes the instrument through which brute force tyrannizes over intelligence and thrift , and seeks to bring society to an artificial dead level .

		Until a political system shall have provided the means for protecting the individual in his con - stitutional immunities against this most ruthless organ of government , it will not have solved our great problem .

		It will , even , in its transfer of the balance of governmental power from the executive to the legislature , have placed a more formidable obstacle in the way of its solution . ''

		In the constitutions at present operative in
Europe	LOCATION	, Professor
Burgess	PERSON	finds little ap - proach to a solution of the problem in hand .

		Upon all sides he seeks evidence of the ex - istence of a sovereign power , '' organized back of both Government and Liberty , indepen - dent of both , supreme over both , the origina - tor of both and the determiner of their relations to each other . ''

		Without some such primal and perpetual authority , we are told , there can be , at best , only a truce in the con - flict between
Government	ORGANIZATION	and Liberty .

		The results are not flattering .

		Every European constitution save the Swiss , it is asserted . ''

		confounds the sovereign body with the Gov - ernment or some part thereof in such a way as to leave no sphere for Liberty into which the
Government	ORGANIZATION	may not , in some manner and degree , intrude . ''

		Furthermore , the indis - criminate extension of the suffrage in the various countries has been adding steadily to the tyrannical character of the legislative bodies ; and the universal exaltation of the popular branch of the legislature , by intro - ducing in effect the unicameral principle , is accentuating the tendency . ''

		In a single sentence , the unicameral
Legisla	PERSON	- ture with the existing electorate moves along towards the socialistic state and the socialistic state does not recognize any sphere of Individual Immunity defined and guaranteed by the Constitu - tion against the powers of
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can not , therefore , consider the present constitutions of the European states as offering any satisfactory solu - tion of the great problem of the reconciliation of Government with Liberty .

		Liberty is sacrificed to
Government	ORGANIZATION	in them all . ''

		In his closing chapters the author turns to `` the effort of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		So far as the
United States	LOCATION	is concerned , it is shown that , until recently , at any rate , the country ex - hibited a fuller measure of reconciliation of government and liberty than does any other
State	ORGANIZATION	in the world .

		The completest harmo - nizing of the two great interests would have required some readjustments , but no radical or revolutionary changes .

		But , unfortunately , upwards of twenty years ago there set in a change , and since that time the trend has been rather steadily in the wrong direction .

		This shift came in consequence of the adop - tion of an imperial policy abroad -LRB- incident to the Spanish War -RRB- and of a paternal pro- gramme at home .

		Evidences of it which the author cites include both of the recently adopted amendments of the Constitution : the Sixteenth , which liberates
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from all limitations in dealing with the property of the individual , and the Seventeenth , which removes the safeguards arising from the ` con - servative structure of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is high time , '' Professor
Burgess	PERSON	declares , '' for us to call a halt in our present course of increasing the sphere of Government and de - creasing that of Liberty . ''

		In
Latin America	LOCATION	the situation is found to be distinctly favora - ble .

		Six states
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Colom	LOCATION	- bia ,
Peru	LOCATION	,
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and
Venezuela	LOCATION	have made the declaration of individual immuni - ties against governmental power a most im - portant part of their constitutional law , and have vested in judicial tribunals power to protect the realm of individual immunity
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 against encroachment by any branch of gov - ernment .

		In the reconciliation of government with liberty these six states have gone well beyond
Europe	LOCATION	.

		If their political civilization is backward , it is because of the character of their populations , not because of the theory of their public law .


Argentina	LOCATION	, it is declared , contains all of the factors necessary for a sat - isfactory solution of the problem of recon - ciliation .

		THE CLASSICS .

		* If Mr.
Albert Mordell	PERSON	had come ten years earlier with his book on ''
Dante	PERSON	and Other Waning Classics , '' we might have praised him for having the courage of his conviction ; we might have wondered at his audacity in try - ing to displace a mountain range with the push of his single shoulder .

		But opinion has moved rapidly of late .

		It is now pretty well understood that every new Novelist or Dramatist of the Dismal is superior to Shake - speare ; and that all the Illuminati of Irregular Verse are better poets than
Milton	LOCATION	.

		The real heroes of criticism are those who cover the retreat of the disgraced classics .

		Why can not the modernists live and let live ?

		Do they think that by eating their grandfathers they will acquire all their virtue and reputation ?

		It was not always so .

		Lit - erature presents the spectacle of a long pro- cession of great writers holding by each others ' robes , and , incidentally , with their hands in each others ' pockets .

		Virgil pays Homer the flattery of continuous imitation .

		To
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	is the highest type of human reason .

		Milton bows to '' blind Thamyris and blind Ma?onides . ''

		Even the leaders of a rival school , the earlier rationalists and real - ists , were true to their forbears .

		Voltaire held by the Greek tragedians .

		Pope and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	edited Shakespeare and praised him nobly .

		The great writers of the last centn ry ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Hugo ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, prostrated themselves before their predecessors .

		Thacke - ray wanted to black
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's boots .

		In general , every one who has become an idol has been an idolater .

		It is mainly the ideas of the writers whom Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	attacks , their views of life , the cosmogonies and religious ideals which they embody , which he thinks effete , foolish , unfit for contemporary consumption .

		We do not believe that any great thought or speculation which has entered the world can die .

		It may be driven aside , and compelled to lead a sub - * DANTB AND OTHER WANING CLASSICS .

		terranean existence for a time ; but it almost certainly comes back or up .

		There must al - ways be changes of opinion , revolutions .

		But the business of a revolution is to revolve , and it generally finds itself back in the same place .

		Take the ideal of feudalism , which Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	thinks particularly obsolete .

		Two years ago it did seem to be comfortably bur - ied .

		But it has pushed aside '' the ponder - ous and marble jaws wherein we saw it quietly inurned , '' and has made a great struggle for existence .

		We all hope that it will be driven back into the tomb ; but of its present vitality there can not be a doubt .

		It is the same with religious ideas , Catholic or Protestant .

		The booming of the cannon seems to have deepened the notes of the church bells all over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And occultism , supernaturalism !

		If a flood of books on such subjects is any indication , these dreams or illusions of man are coming back with a rush .

		It is quite possible that some of us may live to see witches burned again on
Boston Common	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even , however , if ideas can be permanently pushed aside , execution , the projection of great figures , the painting of wonderful scenes , the mighty or mysterious use of lan - guage , must retain their hold on the human mind .

		If we have no other use for the great writers of the past , we must go to them to learn how to write .

		With the possible excep - tion of aKempis , all those on Mr.
MordelTs	PERSON	catalogue of incorrigibles were great execu - tants .

		He allows
Dante	PERSON	two great episodes and a few minor passages , and dismisses the rest of his poem as useless lumber .

		Well ,
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	said the same thing , and Landor and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	turned from the Florentine in sheer disgust .

		Such antipathies must always occur .

		But by the great and continually increasing voice of criticism .

		Dante is hailed as the man who has said more profound things , painted more vivid pictures , than any one else has ever done in an equal space .

		To object to the horror , the painful - ness , of many of these pictures seems illogical in a writer who thinks so well of the work of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	and
Dostoieffsky	ORGANIZATION	.

		These later tragedians placed their infernos on the earth , whereas
Dante	PERSON	concentrated his in a region of their own .

		Their effect on our feelings , we should think , would be the same in either case .

		Mil - ton is another poet who condenses human experience and vision .

		There is probably more picture and music to the page in him than in any one since .

		Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	objects to the figures of Sin and Death .

		To us they seem almost unparalleled in imaginative vigor .

		Even in the long later stretches of '' Paradise Lost . ''

		which because of a lack of interesting 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	matter are tiresome , there is always the high level of diction , the movement of a great tide of verse .

		Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	does not find any mes - sage of importance in
Pascal	LOCATION	's '' Thoughts . '

		They do not pretend to be a system , they are only scattered sparks , many of which , however , have kept alight to the present day .

		The great
Pascal	PERSON	is the
Pascal	PERSON	of the ' '
Provin	PERSON	- cial Letters , '' who ought to appeal to Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	because he was a liberalizer , a revo - lutionist , a miniature Luther .

		Indeed , he dealt a deadlier blow to Jesuitism than
Luther	PERSON	did to Catholicism .

		Is Bunyan negli - gible ?

		Is the man who stamped a number of images or visions , the Slough of
Despond	LOCATION	, the
Giant Pape	ORGANIZATION	in his Cave , Vanity Fair , the
Delectable Mountains	LOCATION	, so firmly on the mind of his race that literature and art have been incessantly repeating them ever since , is such a writer a nobody ?

		We do not believe it .

		And
St. Augustine !	ORGANIZATION

		The
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	is largely founded upon him , and the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	is surely a present verity .

		Besides , the very germ of all modern philosophy ,
Descartes	PERSON	's `` I think , therefore I am , '' is in
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		This alone would make him important .

		Mr.
Mordell	PERSON	has the real reading which makes a full mind ; he has a trenchant style and a lawyer-like expertness in putting his case .

		It is unpleasant to have to differ so totally from him .

		But what would he have ?

		If , like Prospero , we must bury the Book of the Magic of the Past , and accept the mod - ernists at their own valuation , what guaran - tee have we that to-morrow there will not be a crop of neo-modernists who will declare the others antiquated .

		If we regard what is tak - ing place in art to-day , this is exactly what will happen .

		Novelists will be as soon out of date as newspapers , and poets will hardly outlast the full moon that inspires them .

		Per - manence of fame , what we are accustomed to call literary immortality , will be a jest .

		We presume the modernists are out for perma - nent fame .

		Criticism ought to , and mainly does , concern itself with contemporary pro- duction ; but it ought also to hold fast by what it knows to be abiding .

		In two volumes of '' Notes of a Busy Life '' Mr.
Joseph Benson Foraker	PERSON	has sketched his expe - rience of three years in the

Ohio	LOCATION	, and twelve years in the senate of the

BELGIUM	LOCATION	'S AGOXY .

		* Neutrals are constantly finding ground for optimism in the fact that all the belligerent nations in the present war are exceedingly anxious to justify themselves before the su - preme court of public opinion .

		Frankly , any - one condemned to read much of the polemic that has been raging since the war began has need of keeping this consolation before his eyes .

		To the neutral American mind the ver - dict in the case of the violation of
Belgium	LOCATION	has never hung in the balance .

		We accepted the first statement of the German chancellor , and have seen no reason to change our deci - sion .

		Yet both sides continue to thunder diatribe and recrimination .

		Both sides quote
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's words : '' Truth must constantly be re-stated , for falsehood never ceases to whis - per in our ears . ''

		As applied to much of the `` literature '' -LRB- with apologies to that noble word -RRB- on the subject , this citation seems al - most blasphemous .

		It is probably impossible at this time for any of the belligerents , at least , to utter that truth of which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	spoke .

		A rapid survey of a few of the recent discussions of the Belgian case must suffice here .

		Not long after the outbreak of the war the Belgian government appointed a commission to investigate the alleged violation of the rights of non-combatants .

		The reports of this commission , sifted from the testimony of eye - witnesses under cross-examination , are heart - rending ; evidence can be found in them to substantiate all the atrocities with which we are only too familiar .

		Let us hope that they are greatly exaggerated ; but the proclama - tions of the German General Staff are hardly reassuring .

		For instance : '' In future the localities nearest to the place where similar acts -LSB- the destruction of a railway line and telegraph wires -RSB- take place will be punished without pity : it matters little if they are accomplices or not . ''

		Louvain and Belgian villages in ashes are a terrible commentary on this pitiless punishment .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 73
Last December	DATE	M.
Emile Waxweiler	PERSON	wrote from
Switzerland	LOCATION	a book which , published simultaneously in French and German , has been widely read in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The title of the American edition , ``
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Neutral and Loyal , '' gives a fair idea of the contents .

		There is nothing really new in the book ; but at least the author is to be congratulated for having maintained , nearly always , a tone of moderation .

		Even in the concluding chap - ter .

		a discussion of the German methods of war .

		he deliberately refrains from citing the testimony of eye-witnesses , which , he realizes , may often be exaggerated ; he confines him - self instead to a discussion of the German military manual and its remorseless applica - tion to
Belgium	LOCATION	.


Herr Richard Grasshoff	PERSON	's '' The Tragedy of
Belgium	LOCATION	'' is more painful reading .

		It is an abusive answer to
M. Waxweiler	PERSON	, and falls by its own violence .

		The book attempts to prove that the Belgian government has only its own treacherous machinations to thank for the national calamity .

		The government is accused of having deliberately encouraged a guerrilla warfare which obliged the pacifically disposed Germans to stern measures of repression .

		The object of the government is stated as having probably been to supply to its official commis - sion material for fabrications in regard to out - rages committed by German soldiers .

		The reader wonders , on finishing the tirade , what connection the contents have with the title .

		There is nothing to indicate that the book is a translation : if .

		as one suspects , it is the same authors `` Belgien 's Schuld '' in English dress , the new title , apparently meant to sweeten the pill for American readers , will scarcely tend to increase our confidence in the argument .

		Mr.
Alexander Fuehr	PERSON	's '' The Neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	'' has at least the merit of being writ - ten in judicial tone .

		The book attempts to prove , first , that
England	LOCATION	has always been the power behind the Belgian nationality , that she has unscrupulously used the smaller nation for her own ends , and that , before the out - break of the war ,
Germany	LOCATION	had sufficient evi - dence that Belgian neutrality had become a dead letter .

		-LRB- For which , see the
Brussels	LOCATION	documents . -RRB-

		Second , that the treaties pro- viding for
Belgium	LOCATION	's neutrality have , by the law of nations , been void for many years , and have been so considered by
England	LOCATION	: third , that even had any treaty been in force , Ger - many would have been justified in invading
Belgium	LOCATION	under the particular circumstances .

		The particular circumstances are , of course , the famous German necessity .

		The author , a doctor of law , supports his position by cita - tions from English and American jurists .

		His arguments seem scarcely disingenuous to the lay reader , who is inclined to hope that the jurists concerned would disavow this applica - tion of their thought , and observe that the devil , under stress of necessity , can quote Scripture .

		It is pleasant to turn from these contro - versial volumes to one or two books which have value as human documents .

		In her `` Journal of Impressions in
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	tells with no little humor the experiences of a
British Red Cross Corps	ORGANIZATION	in its infancy .

		It was given to her to see little or nothing of the actual fighting , and she relates only what she has seen or felt .

		Her account holds the reader by the lively por - trayal of the members of the
Corps	ORGANIZATION	, and the reaction on them of the scenes behind the firing lines .

		When one lays down the book , one knows the whole staff as thoroughly as one knows any of the characters of Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's novels - , and they are people whose acquain - tance is even better worth making .

		In `` The Log of a Non-Combatant , '' Mr.
' Horace Green	PERSON	gives a vivid account of the adventures of a newspaper correspondent in the midst of the fighting and in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He came into intimate relations with Belgian , | British , Dutch , and German soldiers , and I later with the German people .

		His anecdotes ' are keenly interesting in themselves , and illus - trate national and personal characteristics that stand out even in the stress of war .

		As he was bent on missing nothing , and was not always provided with all the necessary cre - dentials , time never hung heavy on his hands for lack of excitement .

		In an appendix he discusses briefly the '' atrocities , '' and is in - clined to believe that the reports of unpro - voked personal outrages have been greatly exaggerated .

		In reviewing
Zweig	PERSON	's study of Yerhaeren for THE DIAL some weeks ago , I wrote of the poet 's last works : '' This singer of force , of universal energy working with common inter - est toward cosmic progress , finds a higher ideal still the union of humanity by uni - versal love and admiration which joins men in their common purpose and musters indi - viduals and nations into a common cause the striving for the onward march of life ... I We need not wonder if his bitterness knows no bounds to-day . ''

		The volume entitled ''
Belgium	LOCATION	's Agony '' is the first expression of his feeling to reach
America	LOCATION	.

		The English version , well executed in spite of occasional slips , contains a short notice of M. Ver - haeren 's earlier work , and three war poems 74 -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	not yet translated .

		The first and best of these poems , `` La Belgique Sanglante , '' is filled with the spirit of his last ante bellum verse , and foreshadows his great disillusion .

		It strikes poignantly the key-note of the book , which , with its brief but loving sketches of Belgian landscape and homes before they were laid waste , throws over the present horror a lurid light that no official report could give .

		From the devastation two sentiments arise in Belgian hearts : first , pride in their country 's heroism and the firm faith that she will emerge with a strengthened ideal ; second , a bitter hatred of the ruthless invader .

		The last chapters form a terrible indict - ment of that invader .

		In
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's view ,
Germany	LOCATION	has a barrack-bred culture but no civilization , for civilization means a sense of honor that outbalances egotistical interest , a spiritual force which is the negation of brute force .


Germany	LOCATION	's awful and sinister mission is to let loose her hordes upon
Europe	LOCATION	, whose ideals have left her far behind .

		For the sake of world-domination she must crush the individual life of other nations , and de - stroy all art , past and present , that is not her own .

		She would mould genius itself in her own image .

		She believes her organized culture to be the last word of modernism , and forgets that the religious tyrants of the dark ages tried to impose it by not dissimilar meth - ods .

		At bottom the only difference is that the one tyranny was religious , the other is civil .

		As
Spain	LOCATION	of the sixteenth century , imbued with the spirit of
Africa	LOCATION	, sowed in each of her soldiers the lessons of cruelty , so
Germany	LOCATION	to-day , imbued with the spirit of prehistoric
Asia	LOCATION	, inculcates terrorism as a potential offen - sive weapon .

		There is no more honor or chivalry ; but only treachery , cruelty , and lies ; the enemy 's every action is known to cloak a crime .


Germany	LOCATION	's utter indifference to ideals is revealed in the attitude of her statesmen toward international relations .

		Even when she presented her ultimatum to
Belgium	LOCATION	, she came prepared for huckstering , talking of profit and loss as on the stock exchange .

		Finally
Germany	LOCATION	's effort to spread her culture/born of the past , is diametrically opposed to `` the spirit of to-day , wrought of pride and liberty , wrought of human reason and human idealism , wrought of an emotion infectious and splendidly dangerous , which is little more than a hundred years old , and the strength and brilliance of which time has not yet brought fully to light . ''

		Such , in sub - stance , is
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's bitter indictment of the invaders of his country .

		Lovers of poetry should welcome an intro - duction to another Belgian bard ; and the slender volume of `` Belgian Poems '' by
M. Emile Cammaerts	PERSON	will not , we trust , pass un - noticed in the hurly-burly of war books .

		The poems are published in French , with transla - tions of varying success on the opposite page .

		It is to be hoped that translators of foreign poets will more generally adopt this form of presentation , which has long been used in
France	LOCATION	for the classics .

		Most of the English versions are due to
Madame Cammaerts	ORGANIZATION	.

		The collection contains war songs , Christmas carols , and poems of love and domestic felicity .

		Perhaps the most striking feature of them all is their directness and simplicity .

		The poet feels this quality , and says , as he explains the purpose of the book -LRB- the proceeds , are to purchase tobacco for the Belgian sol - diers -RRB- : '' J'ai mis ici des naivetes Dont les moqueurs se gausseront .

		Ma lyre tinte d'une corde , mon vers cloche d'urt pied Et je n'ai guere d'inspiration .

		J'ai mis ici mon coeur tout nu Que m ` importe qu ' on raille !

		Pourvu qu ' Us fument une pipe de plus Sous la mitraille . ''

		The spirit of the war poems is that robust joy in the consciousness of moral strength that rings through
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's work .

		Here is a stanza from a stirring marching song , '' Le Drapeau Beige '' : '' Rouge pour la pourpre heroi ` que Noir , jaune et rouge Noir pour le voile des veuves Noir , jaune et rouge Et jaune pour 1 ` orgueil epique Et le triomphe apres 1 ` epreuve . ''

		One of the most striking of the patriotic pieces is the following , entitled '' Les Renforts .

		delaMort '' : '' II est une armee mysterieuse Qui ne saurait perir , , Et dont les ombres silencieuses Hantent notre souvenir .

		C'est 1 ` armee de ceux qui sont morts En maudissant les Allemands , Et dont les irivincibles renforts Vengeront le sang innocent . ''

		Those who would turn aside from the horror and hatred of war will prefer the last two - thirds of the volume .

		For them let us cite in closing this stanza from '' L'Enf ant '' : '' 0 , mystere , mystere de ton ame d'enf ant !

		Combien j' ai honte de si mal deviner , Combien je rougis d'etre grand Aupres de mon bebe ! ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 75 BECEXT ROMANTIC PLAYS .

		* Perhaps the most conspicuous trait of re - cent drama , viewed as a whole , is the ten - dency toward wide experimentation .

		In this respect our time resembles the latter part of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	.

		Then , as now , there was a keen and rapidly growing popular interest in the theatre , which drew writers of all sorts , including some whose natural gift was far from dramatic , into playwriting .

		Novelists like Lyly and
Greene	PERSON	, lyric poets like
Peele	PERSON	, satirists like
Nash	PERSON	, moralists and classical scholars like
Jonson	PERSON	and
Chapman	PERSON	, were all driven into dramaturgy .

		Then , as now , determined attempts were being made to use the drama for educational and moral purposes .

		Many of the experiments were abortive , but all were more or less instructive as to what can and what can not be done in a play .

		Nothing could furnish better evi - dence than this wide experimentation that the drama to-day is intensely alive .

		Our poets , novelists , reformers , and social philosophers would not be trying to reach or move the world through an art which was in a mori - bund or decadent state .

		It seems reasonable to hope that the present rather chaotic condi - tion of the drama may issue in some great and permanent achievement .

		The strongest current is undoubtedly in the direction of realism ; but there are eddies and cross - currents worth taking into account .

		What - ever the triumph of realism , it will always be one of the functions of the theatre to take us away from the commonplace world into some land of enchantment .

		It is perhaps rather significant that Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	and Mr.
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	, both of whom started out as realists , have turned in their latest plays to romance .

		Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	, indeed , has gone or tried to go all the way to fairy-land . ''

		sen 's , has simplicite , and not , like Mr.
Shel	PERSON	- don 's , simplesse .

		Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's simplicity , as well as his plot , is over-elaborated .

		The charm of such a story is a delicate and evanescent thing , '' Frail as are the wings that grace Thistledown or butterfly . ''

		Even great literary talent , combined with the best will in the world , can not catch it and magnify it and embody it for us on the stage .

		Only a master of what
Addison	PERSON	called `` the fairy way of writing '' could hope to touch it without losing something of its secret .

		Of living dramatists ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	alone , perhaps , could succeed in the task .

		It is no mean praise of Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	to say that he has not entirely failed , that though he has loaded his story with details , he has contrived to keep a little of its wistful charm .

		But he is not at his best in this kind of writing ; he is inclined to make his mermen and mermaids talk , as
Addison	PERSON	says , '' like people of his own species , and not like other beings , who .

		.

		think and talk in a different manner from that of mankind . ''

		Mr.
William Lindsey	PERSON	's `` Red Wine of
Roussillon	LOCATION	'' takes us back to the twelfth century in
Provence	LOCATION	, the time of trouba - dour and crusader .

		Raimon , Count of
Rous	PERSON	- sillon , has for two years been absent in the Holy Land , and is reported to have fallen in battle .

		He was sent thither to do penance for a deed of violence ; in love with Sere - monda , he had slain her bridegroom at the altar , and forcibly married her .

		In his absence she has fallen in love with his young friend
Guilhem	PERSON	, a nobleman and a trouba - dour ; but
Guilhem	PERSON	declares his love only after they have received apparently certain news of
Raimon	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		At the very moment of his declaration ,
Raimon	PERSON	has arrived in the village , and is on his way to the castle .

		Sere - monda begs Guilhem to flee with her , but because of his friendship with
Raimon	PERSON	he refuses ; and to save the situation , it is agreed that Guilhem shall pretend to be in love with her sister
Guida	PERSON	.

		But the jealousy of Sere - monda , who perceives that
Guida	PERSON	really loves Guilhem , is aroused ; and when the trouba - dours are entertaining the household after dinner , by a preconcerted signal she com - mands Guilhem to declare in his song his love for her .

		The catastrophe is only postponed by the intervention of the priest
Aimar	PERSON	; it finally involves the death of the lovers and of the madly jealous count .

		Except for a little slowness in the exposition , Mr.
Lindsey	PERSON	has handled his plot well , making the most of its strong dramatic moments .

		The crisis scene , 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	in which Seremonda , by the sign of suddenly breaking her fan , forces her lover to a public declaration , would be impressive on the stage ; and others , such as the return of the count , and his appearance at the castle after slaying Guilhem , are almost equally strong .

		The play is written in blank verse , which though it falls short of greatness is vigorous , flexible , and free from affectation of archaism , a far better medium than prose for a story of this kind .

		The characters , even the minor ones , are distinct and individual .

		Yet in spite of these great merits , the play somehow leaves one a little cool .

		The reason , I think , is that the interest is not sharply focussed ; the emphasis is divided too evenly among the principal characters , with the result that though we sympathize with them all , we do not sympathize intimately or passionately with any of them .

		The most attractive figure is that of Guilhem , but he is presented to us less fully than either of the others .

		Verse far more sensitive , and exquisitely adapted to its purpose , is that of Miss Con - stance
D'Arcy Mackay	PERSON	in '' The Beau of Bath , and Other One-Act Plays . ''

		This little vol - ume contains six short dramatic sketches , written in rhymed couplets of exceptional fin - ish and charm .

		They present incidents , real or fancied , in the lives of famous eighteenth century people .


Beau Nash	PERSON	, old and broken , is playing solitaire beside the grate on Christ - mas Eve ; he falls asleep , and in his dream the Lady of the Portrait comes down and talks with him of their old unspoken love .


Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	is caught by her uncle revis - ing the manuscript of ''
Evelina	PERSON	, '' after he has been telling her of the success of the book , and has promised that she may read it if he thinks it proper for her .


Avis Linley	PERSON	, years ago disappointed in love through the interference of her brother , helps her niece to elope with
Richard Brinsley Sheridan	PERSON	.

		All of these situations are lightly and charm - ingly sketched , with a keen sense of dramatic values ; but the best of the pieces are the last two , '' Counsel Retained '' and '' The Prince of Court Painters . ''

		In the former Peg Woffington takes refuge from her admirers in an open casement , and finds herself in the shabby chambers of
Edmund Burke	PERSON	, then poor and unknown .

		In the second ,
George Rom	PERSON	- ney , broken , ill , and forsaken by his court friends , asks for charity at a cottage door in the country , where lives the deserted wife of his youth , still proud of his fame and faithful to his memory .

		Neither at first knows the other ; and their gradual recognition is pre - sented with extraordinary delicacy and dra - matic skill .

		The plays are intended primarily for amateurs , but they would furnish oppor - tunity for the most finished professional acting .

		The convenient and inexpensive series of `` The World 's Best Plays , '' edited by Dr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	, includes translations by the editor of two French plays which trifle agree - ably with romantic motives ,
Rostand	PERSON	's '' The Romancers '' and
Octave Feuillet	PERSON	's `` The Fairy . ''

		The former is so well known in
America	LOCATION	as to need no comment here .

		The latter is a graceful one-act piece the scene of which is a cottage on the boarder of the enchanted forest of Broceliande .

		The fairy , one rather regrets to say , turns out to be an ingenious young lady who wins her lover by means of very natural magic .

		Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	's lyric drama , '' The Immigrants , '' is the libretto of an opera , the music for which has been written by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
S. Converse	ORGANIZATION	.

		The theme is strikingly expressed in the speech of
Noel	ORGANIZATION	, an American artist , as the immigrant ship enters
New York	LOCATION	harbor : ''
America	LOCATION	, dear motherland of men , Age after age lodestar of immigrants , Hark to these peoples crying in the mist !

		Here where you loose your cities on the sea , Leviathans of lightning spire on spire , Palace and hanging garden of the waves , Whose spacious splendors house the lords of life - Here , under all , cramped in their vitals , swarm The seekers after life the slaves of toil , With hearts of yearning .

		remember these And feed the awful hunger of their hearts ! ''

		A group of Italian peasants , gay and poor , are beguiled by a commercial agent , who uses a moving-picture show as bait , to leave their homes and seek better things in
America	LOCATION	.

		They are helped by the young artist , and ex - ploited by the agent , a beast who attempts to seduce the girls .

		They find sweatshop labor , wretched food and quarters , and at last imprisonment and death .

		Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	is necessarily handicapped somewhat in treating the theme by the requirements of the operatic form .

		Scammon , for instance , the agent , loses reality when he begins to sing in lilting meas - ures , a strange siren !

		But though the piece does not represent the author at his best , it contains eloquent verse and a number of attractive lyrics .

		The recent death of
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	lends a melancholy interest to what is probably his last play .

		On the whole , in treating of war , the realists have the better of it .

		`` Armaged - don '' is a strange and sad fulfilment of the fears expressed in `` A Poet 's Prayer '' -LRB- pub - lished in `` New Poems , ''
1907	DATE	-RRB- :
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 77 '' Desert me not , when from my flagging sails Thy breathing dies away , and virtue fails , And I , from splendour thrown , and dashed from dream , Into the flare pursue the former gleam .

		Else shall thy dreadful gift still people Hell , And men not measure from what height I fell . ''

		No criticism of `` Armageddon '' could be more exact or more severe than this prophecy .

		Even to the letter it has been realized .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	still had vigorous rhetoric at his com - mand ; he was visited still by intermittent gleams of poetry .

		But in this play he has `` peopled Hell '' -LRB- the scene of the prologue and epilogue -RRB- with demons who speak not in the large accents of his Prometheus , but in the rant of Tamburlaine . ''

		Arise now , Massacre !

		Thou favorite daughter , Got in adultery ` neath a moody moon , Awaken to the smell of infant blood ! ''

		`` Into the flare '' with a vengeance !

		The scenes which represent
Germany	LOCATION	at war are sorry caricatures .

		The best part of the play is the scene in which the French ; Belgian , and British generals express their national points of view ; and even here the inspiration flags , and drama is sacrificed to rhetoric .

		Against a background of early eighteenth century
Japan	LOCATION	, Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's '' The Faith - ful '' tells a story of cruel wrong and revenge .

		Asano , a noble and enlightened Daimyo who has devoted himself to his people , has strug - gled long against the aggressions of his enemy
Kira	PERSON	, an upstart lord who has grown rich and powerful at the expense of his neigh - bors .

		By coldly calculated treachery ,
Kira	PERSON	provokes him to an act of violence which brings upon him the condemnation of the Emperor 's envoy , and death .

		Asano 's friend
Kurano	PERSON	is prevented by a device of his wife 's from being present at the fatal meeting .

		On hearing of it , he devotes himself , his son .

		and a handful of
Asano	PERSON	's followers to the sacred duty of revenge .

		He puts away his wife , who might hinder him in his purpose , and to blind suspicion he feigns madness .

		The wives and children of his followers slay them - selves to leave their lords unhampered in the great design .

		All
Asano	PERSON	's friends are driven into outlawry .

		At last the moment arrives .

		Kira is once more visited by the Emperor 's envoy ; and confident in the sanctity which the Presence gives to his palace , sends away his guards .

		Kurano and his followers sur - prise him as he is dallying with a woman , and magnificently courteous , request him to kill himself with the dagger of
Asano	PERSON	.

		Kira 's courage fails him , and he dies on the sword of Kurano .

		Then , over the grave of
Asano	PERSON	, the faithful receive and execute the Emperor 's sentence upon themselves .

		In its motives of revenge , pretended madness , and the rejection of love through consecration to a terrible duty , the play obviously recalls '' Hamlet . ''

		But
Kurano	PERSON	is troubled by no doubt or hesi - tation ; he waits only till the moment of opportunity , then swift as meditation or the thoughts of love he sweeps to his revenge .

		In style and feeling , the play is closer to classic tragedy than to romance .

		No death takes place on the stage .

		There are only two scenes , between which the action alternates : the open country near
Asano	PERSON	's castle , and a room in the palace of
Kira	LOCATION	.

		The atmosphere through - out is one of gloom , unrelieved except by the triumphant fulfilment of vengeance .

		The play is written in grave and quiet prose , aus - terely simple ; yet through it there swells a mighty and restrained rhythm , as of a distant and muffled drum-beat , breaking at the end into the trumpet-call of the
Herald	ORGANIZATION	who brings to
Kurano	PERSON	and his warriors the mes - sage of death .

		Only a great poet could create a prose like this , sonorous in its very plain - ness , charged with profound feeling , and accurately right in its reticences and its over - tones .

		The fragments of grave and medita - tive song which are scattered through the play are woven into the very texture of the style .

		They are not external ornaments : they fre - quently express the deepest emotions of the singer .

		Thus
Chikara	PERSON	, son of
Kurano	LOCATION	, after he and his father have resolved that the hour of vengeance has come , sings : '' Sometimes , when guests have gone , the host remembers Sweet courteous things unsaid .

		We two have talked our hearts out to the embers , And now go hand in hand down to the dead . ''

		The theme of the play is best expressed in
Kurano	LOCATION	's `` death-poem , '' which is a single sentence : '' Evil is very strong , but men who will give their lives are stronger . ''

		Revenge to
Kurano	PERSON	is not merely a personal matter ; it is the redressing of a great wrong .

		It is the
Dark Tower of Childe Roland	ORGANIZATION	's quest ; to which the way leads through a desolate and cruel region ; for which , though it is ugly in itself , all human bonds must be lightly sun - dered , and life itself is a trivial price , to be paid exultantly .

		Dark as is the tragedy of the story , therefore , its total effect is not de - pressing , but .

		like that of all great tragedy , uplifting .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has written admira - ble poems , but none finer than this dramatic poem in prose .

E. WOODBRIDGE	PERSON	.

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	FICTION .

		* Ever since the immense popularity of `` Waverley , '' the historical novel has had a sort of prescriptive right to be .

		Scott showed clearly how delightful it was to read , and the novelists soon found out how delightful it was to write .

		I believe it was
Gibbon	PERSON	who pointed out that any honest gentleman who wanted to write a book could write a history , for there was the subject matter all ready to hand .

		In like manner , anyone who wanted to write a novel had at once some sort of interest ready-made in the charm and color of some bygone time .

		It is true that ideas conven - tionalized a good deal , especially in the mat - ter of medievalism ; knights , ladies , squires , pages , outlaws , friars got to be stock charac - ters which became wearisome , while the imita - tion of medieval language became an imbecile jargon which even
Stevenson	PERSON	called `` tush - ery . ''

		Into this placid convention Mr.
Mau	PERSON	- rice
Hewlett	PERSON	tossed ``
Richard Yea-and-Nay	PERSON	, '' which surprised and delighted people with the idea that life in the Middle Ages was as real as at any other period .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's '' Fortunes of
Garin	PERSON	'' is a novel of the later type .

		It is not lacking in romance , but it has reality as well .

		Reality , in this case , is not a question of historic accu - racy , though general accuracy is good , prob - ably necessary ; it is a question of vitality .

		One must conceive of the thing in terms of life , which doubtless demands knowledge .

		So Miss
Johnston	PERSON	realizes her setting and her characters , the great cathedral , the feudal castle ; the squire and the jongleur , and all the rest of the stately pageant or panorama which passes before us .

		They must be real places and people , and not vague conventional forms and figures coming from an imagination stimulated by readings and dreamings .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	has been most successful ; from the very beginning one feels that here is a ro - mance that might be of our own day , except for the strange and curious garment of the body and the soul of the men and women therein .

		Yet it is not absolute realism .

		Such a book probably must be always somewhat decorative , conventionalized though not con - ventional .

		We can hardly know that life so well as to permit the utterly true truth .

		It must always be rather like a fine tapestry than like an absolute picture .

		Such a book is a real achievement .

Garin	PERSON	of the
Golden Isle	LOCATION	, and the Princess of the Fair Goal ; also of a man and a woman living in far away
Provence	LOCATION	during the Crusades , when life was far more broken up and mixed than we think who view it through the simplifying media of history and recollection of history .

		It is a well-written book ; like `` The Witch , '' it has less of the semi-lyric note than some of Miss
Johnston	PERSON	's books , and therefore -LRB- we would say -RRB- more of a definite matured char - acter .

		It is a fine book , and not to be vaguely undiscriminating we add that it is not one of the few finest .

		It may be that
Miss Johnston	PERSON	lacks the intensity of imagination necessary to fuse everything in one great impression .

		She often appears to us a little too medita - tive , contemplative , for a great novelist , more like an essayist on the one hand , or a lyric poet on the other .

		If
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's book is a fair try at the best that an historical novel can be , Mr.
Far	PERSON	- nol 's '' Beltane the Smith '' is a very different matter .

		It may be that the author would not wish to have his book thought of as an histori - cal novel , and it is certainly true that it is nothing of the kind .

		But just as surely as '' The Fortunes of Garin '' derives from the sound and fine idea in '' Ivanhoe '' and `` Quen - tin Durward , '' so does `` Beltane the Smith '' derive from what in itself was -LRB- and still is -RRB- good in the hand of a master and an original mind , and yet slight and childish in the hand of one who handles it merely as one would handle the puppets of a marionette show .

		It is no harm -LRB- and indeed it is most delightful -RRB- for a child to be enthralled at the first imagin - ings of knights and outlaws , tournaments and greenwoods ; but it is hardly worthy the time of an adult reader to continue through pages of imaginings suggested thereby .

		That there is something more in `` Beltane the Smith '' is undeniable , but that something is a hindrance rather than a help .

		It con - cerns the serious side of the book , however foolish it may seem to anyone to imagine that there is one .

		Nobody need bother to run a tilt with a man who really tries to present the labors of a young fellow who devotes his life to making a bad world good .

		Such people are too rare in life , and it is good to read of them .

		But the trouble with `` Beltane the Smith '' is that it is not genuine ; it is a mere sham .

		Beltane is not a young man '' versed in woodcraft and ancient philosophies '' ; there is not a single line in the book which shows any woodcraft or philosophy on his part or the part of the author .

		He is not a young man who goes forth in the service of Jesus Christ with the -LRB- mistaken -RRB- notion that the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 79 main thing in His message was '' that He came ' not to bring peace on this earth but a sword . '

		For good can not outface evil , but strife must needs follow . ''

		He is but a blun - dering young fellow of the type of hero brought into painful prominence twenty-five years ago by Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	.

		He is no more genuine than the jargon in which his story is told .

		Nor does the author take his own figures seriously ; he knows there is noth - ing to them , and makes no attempt to realize any of the superficial sentiment that occa - sionally occurs to him .

		or even the various situations which he imagines .


Helen	PERSON	,
Duchess of Mortain	ORGANIZATION	, goes out at night into the wood to seek the young smith whom she had kissed that afternoon in a little visit she had made to the greenwood for that purpose .

		A good while afterward .

		Beltane , who has been wan - dering about with the same
Helen	PERSON	under the disguise of a young knight , finds out who she is on seeing her as she comes out of a wood - land pool and lets down her hair .

		In neither case does Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	give us any idea that we have more than one of the ordinary events of life , in `` that period when Love and Valor were life 's mainspring . ''

		It might seem that much the same sort of thing should be said of Sir
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	's * ' Aladore . ''

		But among many differences be - tween the two books , there is this one , which would be enough were there no others : in `` Aladore '' the author has really in mind as the chief thing the spiritual quest of his hero , and takes the imaginative form which he does take merely as a form : while with Mr.
Far	PERSON	- nol 's book the reverse is the case , he takes the form and mentions a spiritual quest as a substance which he now and then feels is needed to give reality , and the result is .

		that while in '' Beltane the Smith '' we have much conventional bashing and blundering with no significance at all .

		in `` Aladore ' ' we have some very singular pregnant conceptions in the form of imaginative though sometimes whim - sical action .

		Beltane going forth to right the wrongs of Pentavalon at the behest of his father turned hermit is a figure of no real significance .

		But when
Twain	PERSON	goes forth from his estate with the child , it gradually dawns on us that in his search for something more satisfying than wealth and power he is really guided by the freshness and sincerity of his own youth .

		The thing shows even in language .

		It is not necessary to say that `` Aladore '' is written in any form of the English language that ever was actually spoken or written .

		But even if not .

		Sir
Henry	PERSON	's dialect is a dialect of his own -LRB- like
William Morris	PERSON	's -RRB- , the result of actual familiarity with old forms and old literatures .

		`` We may not like it : when he says that the hermit threw his crumbs out to '' dunnocks and finches '' we may prefer some other names for the birds , dyke-snowier , for in - stance , or the more familiar hedge sparrow .

		The words or phrases may not be really archaic : `` cot and lot , barn and balk . ''

		says the book ; we never heard the latter phrase , but if not remembered it is a good imagina - tion .

		If the book says '' laylock bushes '' it is a pleasure to remember that current Ameri - canisms are often descended from English dialects .

		So all the way from the idea at the very core to the language on the very out - side , one may test the book and find it ring true ; one may find something that actually arose in the mind of the poet and therefore makes the mysterious effect upon our own minds .

		So much , though it leaves out all but inner - most kernel and outer shell , should be enough to send to the book most of those who would be likely to enjoy it .

		Sir
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	is best known to us as a poet ; everyone knows his `` Admirals All . ''

		His poetic romances are not so well known , but they are equally well grounded in an intuitive perception of some of the things that are great in life .

		We ought to mention , also , the drawings of his sometime co-worker , the Lady
Hylton	PERSON	-LRB- with apologies for our own affectations of lan - guage -RRB- , which are very much in the spirit of the romance .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS . ''

		How Diplomats Make War '' of secret -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of a book diploma ** .

		recently published which many of its readers will feel has appeared at the moment when it was most required .

		Amidst the high pressure of emotionalism in which sane judgments are at a premium , and strong opinions on one side or another are regarded as .

		inevitable , it is well to be re - minded that quarrels between nations , as between individuals , are usually due to `` faults on both sides . ''

		The `` British states - man '' who is the anonymous author of this book has collected a mass of evidence drawn from the various manifestos of the warring countries as well as from the parliamentary reports of questions addressed by British members to the Prime Minister and foreign secretary ; all going to show that undue secrecy as to the commitments of the govern - ment had been preserved during the half - dozen years preceding the outbreak of the 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	war .

		The indictment is indeed a serious one .

		The whole principle of democracy is involved in the question as to whether it should be possible for the government of a country to commit its people to ententes and alliances that may lead to international conflict , with - out the full knowledge and consent of the representatives of the people .

		To admit the legitimacy of such irresponsible action is to throw away the only guarantee we possess against the evil of autocracy and to abandon the entrenchments of popular liberty that have been laboriously erected during the last hundred years .

		The chief service which this book renders to those who wish to see all round the problem of the original causes of the war , lies in its suggestion that there is a case for
Germany	LOCATION	as well as for
Britain	LOCATION	and her Allies .

		The author supplies statistics with a liberal hand , going to prove that the estimates for army and naval enlargement and construction on the part of the Allies during the past few years have been consid - erably in excess of
Germany	LOCATION	's , and that Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's proposal for '' a naval holiday '' as between
Germany	LOCATION	and
Britain	LOCATION	, while
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	were increasing their armaments , was one that
Germany	LOCATION	must necessarily have declined .

		If it is true that , without the knowl - edge of the people 's elected representatives and in spite of questions repeatedly asked and answered in the negative , the Cabinet com - mitted themselves to certain courses of action that could only be interpreted by
Germany	LOCATION	as a policy of isolation and unfriendliness , then the British people should know of it , and decide once for all whether their parlia - mentary institutions are for the future to be made secure against the recurrence of such violations of the first principles of constitu - tional government .

		Believers in the laws of causation can not regard the hatred in which
Britain	LOCATION	is held by
Germany	LOCATION	as without ade - quate foundation , and an attitude of diligent heart-searching would undoubtedly be the most becoming one for the people of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		The time has come when nations , like individuals , must learn that not only is honesty the best policy , but that open - ness and sincerity and friendliness produce like feelings in other nations , and that day - light is the one sanative influence under which the germs of suspicion and distrust and hatred will never develop .

		The psychology Doubtless the most widespread of individual psychological interest is that shown in the observation and comparison of the widely differing traits of individuals .

		From it have sprung the doctrine of temperaments , and the pseudo-sciences of phrenology , physiognomy , and palmistry , not to mention the older astrological speculations .

		Recently it is manifest once more in the numerous attempts , by a `` mental diagnosis , '' to predict for the individual the pursuit for which his talents best fit him .

		These attempts very largely ignore the plasticity of the mind , and the consequent adaptability of the indi - vidual to a varying environment .

		They as - sume at the outset that the mind is a rather rigid mechanism , and that the individual must fail unless he promptly finds his particular niche in the social and business worlds .

		These attempts all masquerade under the title of '' efficiency , '' a term which , as someone has said , '' should no longer be permitted in polite society without a chaperon . ''

		Of recent books on the psychology of individual differences , one of the best is Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	's `` Character and Temperament '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It will convince the reader that there is not as yet any trustworthy short cut from theory to practice .

		General psychology gives a good outline map of the main features of the human mind .

		This must be filled in with numerous details in order to afford an account of the human diversities included in the terms '' char - acter '' and '' temperament . ''

		Of these Profes - sor
Jastrow	PERSON	gives a qualitative account .

		In the babe a functional trait is little more than the strength and direction of an instinct .

		This remains as its foundation , but it later develops into a generic reactive tendency or a factor modifying such a tendency .

		At this higher level of development , human traits are de - scribed in the text , though brief mention is made of the instinctive root of each one , except perhaps in the intellectual traits such as the sense of detail , aptitude for construc - tion , power of abstraction , '' gift '' in language or mathematics , originality , shrewdness , `` com - mon sense , '' etc. .

		The conclusion is drawn that the differences in traits between men and women , and between white , black , or red races , are comparatively small and overlap .

		The widest differences are individual ones .

		Indi - vidual white men of similar ancestry and environment differ from each other in any one ability more , for example , than the average difference in that trait between men and women .

		Yet differences small in amount may be large in effect .

		What factors or elements of a trait are due to heredity and what to environment or training ?

		In answer to this question some physical `` unit characters '' are named ; but it is thought `` hardly plausible though not impossible that musical ability , like eye color , is a factor absent or present , through the absence or presence of a factor in the germ .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 81 With even more complex traits , such as math - ematical ability or a keen moral sense , the probability grows still less . ''

		While deferring somewhat to the extreme opinion that there is no such thing as general intelligence , Profes - sor
Jastrow	PERSON	inclines to the view that there is a Common aptitude for different types of mental work , and a common fund of energy at whose expense mental work is done .

		The tests of the laboratory are not , perhaps , so successful as those of life in determining individual differ - ences , yet the former tests give us hope of eventual success .

		Possibly the greatest dif - ference among men is that of energy and its emotional counterpart , courage .

		The differ - ing mental traits of the sexes are discussed at length , and also the relation of character to the environment .

		The attentive reader will find that the book supplements the outline of general psychology in many important respects .

		A book of reminiscent gossip .

		So sound a critic as
E. C. Sted	ORGANIZATION	- man pronounced one of Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	's books '' breezy and fascinating , '' and perhaps he was not ex - travagant .

		But one wonders what he would have said of her '' Memories and Anecdotes '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Certainly it is breezy ; but more than that can not be said for it .

		It is the thinnest of gossip , so thin that even large type , and illustrations , and gratuitous quota - tion do not succeed in impressing the reader .

		It might serve as a substitute for an idle hour of reminiscence with a garrulous and egotis - tic old friend ; but it hardly deserves to be called a book .

		These are hard words ; yet softer ones are not easy to find .

		Referring to the criticism offered by a professor at
Dart	PERSON	- mouth ,
Miss Sanborn	PERSON	writes : '' I needed his precautions about spreading myself too thin , about being less flamboyantly loquacious , and subduing my excessive enthusiasm and emo - tional prodigality . ''

		Yes , and this popular lecturer and writer of books needs his precau - tions , at this late day , more than ever .

		Her language is shabby in an age when all writing tends to the journalistic ; she tells mere noth - insrs with infinite and wearisome '' breeziness '' -LRB- `` gusto '' would not serve for her flitting mood -RRB- : she has not even mastered English grammar -LRB- witness , for example , the confu - sion of `` who '' and `` whom '' on pp. 65 and 145 -RRB- .

		In her favor is the wide experience she has had in her work , in many States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		She has seen , not without shrewd - ness , one or two of the greater and many of the lesser lights of her day .

		Here is Bryant : '' What an impressive personality : erect , with white hair and long beard : his eyebrows looked as if snow had fallen on them . ''

		Here is Alcott : `` Alcott made some most remark - able statements , as : ` We each can decide when we will ascend . '

		Then he would look around as if to question all , and add : ' Is it not so ?

		Is it not so ? '

		I remember another of his mystic utterances : ` When the mind is izzing , it is thinking things .

		Is it not so ?

		Is it not so ? ''

		Whitman discusses , in his own way , and in the presence of
Frances E. Wil	PERSON	- lard , the subject of temperance : '' He declared that all this total abstinence was absolute rot and of no earthly use , and that he hated the .

		sight of these women who went out of their way to be crusading temperance fanatics .

		After this outburst he left the room .

		Miss
Willard	PERSON	never alluded to his fiery criticism , did n't seem to know she had been hit , but chatted on as if nothing unpleasant had oc - curred .

		In half an hour he returned ; and with a smiling face made a manly apology , and asked to be forgiven for his too severe remarks . ''

		There are too or three other pas - sages of equal interest , but all too few .

		Mr.
Elliott O'Donnell	PERSON	's `` The iri , h emigrant , jngh Abroad '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is an in many lands . '

		extended account of what the sons of
Erin	PERSON	are doing in various parts of the world , with an introductory chapter on the conditions which forced the Irish to seek homes in foreign lands .

		The author finds his countrymen almost everywhere ; but the greater number of Irish emigrants appear to have settled in English-speaking countries ,
America	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the self-governing British colonies .

		In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the many rebellions against English rule in
Ireland	LOCATION	led to a con - siderable migration to the Continent , espe - cially to
France	LOCATION	, in the armies of which Irish exiles , in thousands , found service ; to the history of this interesting movement , and to the achievements of the Irish in
France	LOCATION	, the author gives several chapters .

		Mr.
O'Donnell	PERSON	's work is somewhat encyclopaedic in character , and contains a great mass of important infor - mation ; but , unfortunately , he has not always been careful to verify his statements , and con - sequently many errors have found their way into the book , particularly into the chapters that deal with the Irish in our own country .

		We are told , for instance , that Irish settlers came to
America	LOCATION	'' in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, when about a thousand , mostly Puritans from all parts of
Ireland	LOCATION	, went to
Maryland	LOCATION	under the leadership of
John Winthrop	PERSON	, and , in
1630	DATE	, founded
Boston	LOCATION	, which has been Irish in the main ever since . ''

		It may be true that eighty per cent of the American Revolution -
82	DATE	-LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	ary army in
1782	DATE	was composed of Irish - Americans , but we should like to see the evidence .

		With the statement that '' there are few names in history deserving of more praise '' than that of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, we do not wish to quarrel , though it seems an exag - geration .

		But it really does startle one to read that Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	ran for president as the '' ad - vocate of monometallism as opposed to the present system of bimetallism . ''

		It is also interesting to note that the story of the Irish in
South America	LOCATION	is made part of a chapter on `` famous Irishmen in the
United States of America	LOCATION	. ''

		Americans of Irish ancestry will be interested in Mr.
O'Donnell	PERSON	's book ; but it is possible that some of them will object to his statements that when the Irish parliament becomes a reality ,
Ireland	LOCATION	will '' bury the hatchet for good , '' and that `` in the present crisis the Great European War the sym - pathy of every true-born / Irishman in the
United States	LOCATION	is entirely with
England	LOCATION	and her Allies . ''

		_ Two fresh introductions to
Browning	PERSON	.

		When
Robert Browning	PERSON	died , twenty-six years ago , the ques - ^ j ^ ^ ^ ^ f requently and discussed most hotly in literary circles was this : Will
Browning	PERSON	's poetry live , will the next generation give him as high rank as is given him to-day ?

		There were those who were ready to assert that it was the
Browning	PERSON	societies that had made
Browning	PERSON	's reputa - tion , an opinion worthy to stand by the side of the statement of the
Stratford	LOCATION	coach-driver who said to the present reviewer : '' We do n't think much of Shakespeare in this town ; it 's the Americans that have made Shakespeare . ''

		Time has settled the old doubts ; and how - ever much lovers of poetry may differ as to `` favorite poets , '' few indeed will deny that the world 's verdict writes
Browning	PERSON	's name very near the top of the list .

		But this is not to say that he is as easy to read as some others ; it makes considerable difference through what poems of his you approach him , a fact which has been recognized by numer - ous writers of `` Introductions to Browning '' during the past quarter-century .

		Two excel - lent guides have lately appeared , Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	's ''
Browning	PERSON	: How to Know Him '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Pro- fessor
Vernon C. Harrington	PERSON	's `` Browning Studies '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- .

		Although the two books have the same purpose , they are quite different in type .

		To the general reader , Dr.
Phelps	PERSON	's volume is the more interesting .

		Though scholarly , it is not pedantic : foot-notes there are none .

		Fifty well-chosen poems are pub - lished entire , to furnish material for discus - sing
Browning	PERSON	's theory of poetry , his aim and method , his leading ideas , his fondness for paradox , and the nature and basis of his optimism .

		Hence it is an agreeable , as well as an instructive , volume for the general reader as far as it goes .

		But , since the pur - pose seems to have been to include only such poems as could be given entire , we have noth - ing of '' The Ring and the Book , '' almost nothing from the dramas , and nothing of ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	'' except some of its lyrics .

		To find fault with a writer of so much humor , charm , and knowledge as Dr.
Phelps	PERSON	is somewhat ungracious ; nevertheless the question arises : Can anyone really '' know '' a poet without considering his masterpieces ?

		Are these not needed to justify Dr.
Phelps	PERSON	's own statement : `` With the exception of Shakespeare , any other English poet could now be spared more easily than
Browning	PERSON	'' ?

		Professor Har - rington 's book is derived from lecture courses given to college students .

		It is frankly academic in type , bristles with foot-notes , is divided into almost endless heads and sub - heads .

		Consequently it is a book for the stu - dent , rather than for the general reader , a reference book for the library shelf , rather than a volume for consecutive reading .

		For the purposes indicated , it is admirable .

		For example , it would be difficult to find a more helpful discussion of '' The Ring and the Book '' than in the fifty pages given to it here .

		Professor
Harrington	PERSON	calls this work `` the most soul-satisfying piece of literature I have ever read .

		In spite of all its defects .

		.

		by its passion , beauty , and wealth of color , and in its marvellous grasp of human nature , it can be compared only with the great operas . ''

		The expulsion of the Germans The fall of a r German outpost trom Shantung by the Japanese , though insignificant in compari - son with many of the other operations of the Great War , may prove to be one of the most important in its after-effects .

		Mr.
Jeffer	PERSON	- son Jones , the only American civilian eye - witness , who accompanied the Anglo-Japanese force , has described the episode in '' The Fall of Tsingtau '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story is not a very thrilling one .

		The garrison of forty-five hundred was doomed from the first , and the delay in forcing the issue was due to a desire to save life or , we are told , to political conditions in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		Yet one must regret that lives were sacrificed , and that the attractive German outpost in
China	LOCATION	had to be demolished by friend and foe .

		More interest - ing than the account of the military operations are the comments of the author on the viola -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 83 tion of Chinese neutrality by the Japanese , on the subordinate position of the British con - tingent , and on the lack of sanitation and dis - cipline in the Japanese force .

		A considerable portion of the volume is devoted to the general situation in the
Far East	LOCATION	, especially as regards the recent Sino-Japanese treaties .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	is a severe critic of the late Japanese diplo - macy , and he apparently must be numbered among the journalists who have adopted a pes - simistic view of
China	LOCATION	's future .

		One of his chapters is entitled '' The Passing of
China	LOCATION	as a Sovereign Power , '' and he is of opinion that '' at half-past 1 o'clock on the
morning	TIME	of Sun - day ,
May 9	DATE	,
China	LOCATION	, the oldest nation in the world , passed under the virtual domination of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		But in the last chapter we learn that ''
New China	LOCATION	.

		.

		gains strength day by day . ''

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	also believes that the real issue between
Japan	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	is not immigration but the attitude of the two gov - ernments toward
China	LOCATION	; but happily `` there is no real ground for apprehension , no real cause for alarm in the relations existing be - tween the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		If `` The Fall of Tsingtau '' runs into a second edition it is to be hoped that the publishers will include a map , for surely there are some readers who canpot easily turn to a large - scale map of the
Shantung Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		The relation of insects to disease .

		The growth of knowledge re - garding the relations of insects to many forms of disease has been so great in the past fifteen years that earlier entomological treatises are wholly in - adequate in their presentation of this aspect of the relations of the arthropods , the greatest of the groups of animals , to human health and welfare .

		Indeed , the available material in this field is now so abundant and so varied that the merest presentation of the impor - tant principles involved in these relationships , of the more salient facts , and of the most striking illustrations , will in itself make a book of considerable size .

		It is in the selec - tion and condensation of such material that the `` Handbook of Medical Entomology '' -LRB-
Comstock Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written by Pro- fessors
W. A. Riley	PERSON	and 0 .


A. Johannsen	PERSON	of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, notably excels .

		The per - spective of relative values so difficult to estab - lish in the infancy of most great advances in knowledge is here not only adequately deter - mined but also well maintained throughout the work .

		The author discusses the growth of knowledge of insect transmission of disease , rather too briefly in the matters of recent history , and then proceeds to the systematic discussion of the several types of relationships which insects bear to disease in man .

		The first of these , often omitted in treatises of this kind , deals with arthropods which are directly poisonous , including the biting , stinging , net - tling , and vesicating insects , mites , and spi - ders .

		Then the truly parasitic mites , ticks , lice , bugs , flies , mosquitoes , midges , fleas , and chiggers are discussed , as well as those which occasionally temporarily adapt themselves to life on or in the human body .

		The most important chapters are those which deal with flies as carriers of typhoid fever , fleas of the plague or `` black death , '' and mosquitoes of malaria and yellow fever , ticks of
Texas	LOCATION	cattle fever and relapsing fever and the fatal spot - ted fever of man , lice of typhus , and the tsetse fly and fleas of the widely spreading sleeping sicknesses of man and other mam - mals .

		Possible but not proved relations of insect agency for the transmission of infantile paralysis , leprosy , pellagra , and cancer are discussed but not accepted .

		There is a synop - tic key for the determination of the insects concerned , a helpful chapter on household fumigation , and an extensive bibliography which omits some of the more important memoirs and includes others of slight conse - quence .

		The illustrations are well chosen , and I generally well executed .

		The book deserves i wide distribution as a concise and comprehen - sive manual of medical entomology suitable alike for the physician , the school , the general library , and as a text-book for university classes .

		The historical novel crops out aJZieZtEnrpt .

		^ our thousand years ago on papyri bearing the tale of an | Egyptian courtier ,
Sinuhe	PERSON	, who had adven - tures in
Palestine	LOCATION	long before the Hebrew nation existed .

		The eastern
Mediterranean	LOCATION	situation a thousand years later appears in the ostensible -LRB- or actual ? -RRB-

		report of an Egyptian priest ,
Wenamon	PERSON	, who had been sent to the
Lebanon	LOCATION	to procure cedar for a sacred barge .

		Half way between these in time ,
Thutiy	LOCATION	, a general of the pharaoh Thutmose III , is pic - tured as capturing
Joppa	LOCATION	by a stratagem sug - gestive of
Ali Baba	LOCATION	and the forty thieves .

		These and other types of Egyptian tales a marvellous sea yarn , talking mummies , prodi - gies worked by magicians are assembled in
M. Maspero	PERSON	's `` Popular Stories of Ancient Egypt '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This volume , translated by Mrs.
C. H. W. Johns	PERSON	from a revision of the fourth French edition of
1911	DATE	, furnishes the most complete treatment of the subject now available .

		Even stories preserved only piece - meal and at second hand by
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and later writers are included .


M. Maspero	PERSON	, in a 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	very readable Introduction , establishes con - nections between the composite plots of these earliest known tales and more familiar epi - sodes in the Old Testament stories , the Arabian Nights , and elsewhere , at the same time show - ing that their atmosphere and setting here are thoroughly Egyptian .

		The '' revision '' of the French edition is almost imperceptible , except that two useful indexes -LRB- lacking in the French -RRB- have been added .

		Each story is accompanied by an apparently complete bibli - ography ; but some important additions since
1911	DATE	remain unmentioned , among them
Vogel	PERSON	- sang 's voluminous commentary on '' The Lamentations of the Fellah . ''

		This same tale , to
M. Maspero	PERSON	apparently a mere `` take-off '' on the sorrows and volubility of the Egyptian peasant , has been well interpreted by Profes - sor Breasted in his unnoted '' Development of Keligion and Thought in Ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- as a social tractate in disguise appeal - ing for a more just officialdom .

		The transla - tions of the tales from the Egyptian depend rather on
M. Maspero	PERSON	's keen intuition , his own extensive studies , and his familiarity with modern
Egypt	LOCATION	, than on the grammatical prin - ciples which have been worked out , chiefly by German scholars , in the last decades .

		Occa - sional loss of coherence and of accuracy in detail results .

		Some points for example , the name and location of the vale to which
Bata	ORGANIZATION	fled -LRB- in the '' Story of the Two
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' p. 9 -RRB- , the nature of the ka , and the meaning of the epithet '' true of voice '' applied to the dead -LRB- p. 84 -RRB- are better explained in other ways than those here adopted .

		Inconspicuous foot - notes seem inadequate for distinguishing the actually surviving portions of the tales from skilfully paraphrased restorations of lost frag - ments .

		Any translation will involve some slips or misunderstandings .

		Mrs.
Johns	PERSON	has , however , as in her previous translations of other worth-while books , well reproduced the spirit of
M. Maspero	PERSON	's suggestive volume .

		Mr.
Beiioc	PERSON	' s war Mr -
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	is known to history .

		- the the American public as an essay - first phase .

		, * - * _ - , .

		- , , , ist , an historian , and the bril - liant mentor of the still more brilliant Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	.

		It may not be so well known that he is a military critic of some repute , with a respectable term of service in the French army behind him .

		He has projected a history of the present European conflict in six volumes , collectively entitled '' The Elements of the Great War , '' of which we now have `` The First Phase '' -LRB-
Hearst 's International Library	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is one of unusual interest , for the author 's lucid and logical mind , more French than English in its texture , brings out in sharp relief the salient features of a very complex situation .

		Indeed , the judicious reader may sometimes wonder if the whole matter is not being made too clear and easy for his readier comprehension .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	passes over the preliminaries of the war with a few pungent , slightly dogmatic , statements .

		Like many another , he is con - vinced that while
Germany	LOCATION	's military prepa - ration had been continuous in a general way since the establishment of the Empire , she had been making specific preparations for the present war three years beforehand .

		The bulk of the book deals with the military move - ments down to
Sept. 5 , 1914	DATE	, the eve of the battle of the
Marne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's specialties are statistics and strategy .

		He has much to say about the relative sizes of the opposing armies , and believes that the Germanic forces greatly outnumbered the Allies in the early stages of the war .

		In the matter of grand strategy , the fight on the western front hinged on the efficacy of the French forma - tion known as `` the open strategic square , '' against the German long line with its envel - oping process .

		This somewhat technical mat - ter is delightfully elucidated with the aid of diagrams .

		Those who read '' The First Phase '' will await eagerly the forthcoming volumes of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's work .

		The story of Vasaar .

		The most recent volume in the `` American Colleges and Univer - sities Series '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a history of Vassar by President Emeritus
Taylor	PERSON	and Associate Professor
Haight	PERSON	.

		The authors present their facts from a point of view distinctly that of administrators : stu - dent activities are not omitted from the story , but they are somewhat slighted , and less atten - tion is given to the influence of student and alumnae criticism on the college development than strict fairness demands .

		Nevertheless , the book is interesting as giving an account of early days at the pioneer among American colleges for women , days that have just been so enthusiastically recalled in the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of its founding .

		Feminists , educators , students , and the gen - eral public will all find matter for thought in this condensed history of yesterday 's phase in the great struggle for women 's freedom .

		Fifty years ago the founders of Vassar -LRB-
Matthew Vassar	PERSON	was but one of a group of far-sighted enthusiasts -RRB- established a broad and sound basis for '' female '' development ; they empha - sized the need for physical training , horse - back riding and dancing , as well as walks and calisthenics ; they insisted on '' aesthetics , '' and a broadly conceived study of music and paint -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 85 ing ; they cried out upon all forms of superfi - ciality ; they pled with more conservative teachers and parents for the right of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	to know the larger world ; they stood unswervingly for non-sectarianism , and for a genuine democracy in the college life that in some of the later days of
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	has been in danger of being forgotten .

		The strug - gles and inspirations of the sixties , the hard - ships and depressions of the seventies and eighties , the triumphant growth of the nineties and of
the first decade of this century	DATE	, are faithfully recounted , though , as has been said , not quite fully .

		Nothing is made , for instance , of the awakening spirit among the students of some eight years ago , or of the still more recent developments in faculty organiza - tion that bid fair to put the college among fearless modern experimenters with the best of new scientific methods in education , a posi - tion which she certainly held at the beginning of her career and which she should as cer - tainly , after the middle years of consolidation and organization , not hesitate to seize upon again .

		To an alumna who reads between the lines of the book , it is this unspoken hope for the future that remains as the clearest mean - ing to be drawn from the account of what has been accomplished in the past by unquestion - ing faith in woman 's potentialities for a large and free self-realization .

		Wagner a * a dramatist .

		`` The Wagnerian Drama '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
Houston Stew	PERSON	- art
Chamberlain	PERSON	, is a translation of the writer 's first book , '' Das Drama Rich - ard `` Wagners , '' which was published in
1892	DATE	.

		There is nothing on the title-page to show that it is not a new book ; the only indication that it is a translation is a note on page 94 signed '' The Translator . ''

		Yet if the reader does not realize that the book dates back nearly a quar - ter of a century , he must inevitably wonder why the author says an undisputed thing in such a solemn way .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's main thesis , so tediously reiterated , is that
Wagner	PERSON	was not the reformer of the opera but the creator of the `` Word-Tone-Drama '' -LRB- sic -RRB- .

		That
Wagner	PERSON	attempted to fuse drama and music is now a commonplace of knowledge ; that he succeeded as a dramatist to anything like the degree that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	claims , few will be willing to concede . ''

		Die
Meister	PERSON	- singer von Xiirnberg '' is the only work of his which could maintain itself as a drama alone ; it assuredly ranks among the best of German comedies .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has in recent years married a daughter of
Wagner	PERSON	, and has taken up his residence at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		It may be presumed , therefore , that he is still in the attitude of adoring discipleship to the great master .

		But there would seem to be no ade - quate reason why this early work , never very perspicacious and now hopelessly out of date , should be offered at this time to the English - speaking world .

		The translation , moreover , is turgid and Teutonic , and gives one a most unfair impression of the author 's really ad - mirable gifts , which he has revealed elsewhere , as a German stylist .

		Militarism in
America	LOCATION	.

		President
Hibben	PERSON	, in his In - troduction to Major-General Wood 's `` The Military Obliga - tion of Citizenship '' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , assures us that General Wood pos - sesses expert knowledge and that it is availa - ble in this volume .

		However , the book is neither original nor profound : its chief au - thorities are
General Upton	ORGANIZATION	and Old Light - Horse
Harry Lee	PERSON	; its argument for pre - paredness is not different from that of the innumerable inexpert communications on the subject in our daily press .

		General Wood wants an army '' sufficient for the peace needs of the nation , '' an adequate navy , adequate reserves , a good militia , and trained volun - teers or citizen soldiers .

		He believes in uni - versal compulsory service similar to that in
Switzerland	LOCATION	or
Australia	LOCATION	.

		But he does not approve of `` militarism , '' and he defines that much-used and little-understood word as fol - lows : `` Militarism .

		.

		means the condition under which the military forces of a nation demand and secure special recognition , both socially and officially , and exercise an undue influence in the conduct of the civil affairs of the government , both at home and abroad . ''

		What is '' undue influence '' to an expert ?

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In an attractive little book entitled '' Protective Ornament '' -LRB-
Rochester	LOCATION	: The Manas Press -RRB- , Mr.
Claude Bragdon	PERSON	, the architect , suggests a new '' form language '' for the decorative arts , to be developed from geometry .

		He maintains his thesis more successfully by means of illustrations than by his text .

		This volume , added to Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	's '' Primer of Higher Space , '' and '' The Beautiful Necessity , '' will suggest to the decorative artist many new and beautiful , as well as artistic , forms of design .

		Not often does one find so much sane and con - structive thinking in so few pages as is contained in Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	's `` A Substitute for War '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , previously printed in the `` North American Review . ''

		War is picturesque ; peace is drab .

		If peace is to replace war , it must be made handsome .

		This is to be done by organizing the armies of peace , and by properly symbolizing their 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 20	DATE	functions by utilizing the arts of the theatre and of pageantry to make them fascinating .

		The
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	, a peace enterprise , captivates the imagination .

		Why can not other constructive proj - ects of society be made equally appealing ?

		The rich fruits which followed a pageant at
Saint Louis	LOCATION	in
1914	DATE	, produced under Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	's personal direction , convince him that it can and should be done . ''

		The Poet 's Lincoln , '' consisting of '' tributes in verse to the martyred President , '' is compiled and published by that zealous and well-informed Lin - colnian , Mr.
Osborn H. Oldroyd	PERSON	.

		He has col - lected in his two hundred and sixty pages many more Lincoln poems of merit than most of us sus - pected to be in existence .

		To trace them and , in many cases , their authorship , must have been a task .

		Dr.
Marion Mills Miller	PERSON	contributes a valua - ble introductory chapter on '' The Poetic Spirit of Lincoln , '' and the Lincoln portraits and other ap - propriate illustrations are many .

		Mention should be made of the worthy purpose of the book , '' to assist in preserving the collection of memorials now contained in the house in which Lincoln died , 516 Tenth Street ,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. '' The vol - ume is published by the editor , at the above address .

		Many a shudder , for those who enjoy shudder - ing and are credulous enough to be made to shud - der , may be had at small cost by purchasing and reading Mr.
Hereward Carrington	PERSON	's '' True Ghost Stories '' -LRB-
Ogilvie	PERSON	-RRB- , a collection of curious tales from such sources as the '' Proceedings of the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, ''
W. T. Stead	PERSON	's '' Real Ghost Stories , '' and Mr.
Robert Dale Owen	PERSON	's '' Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World . ''

		Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	, who is an experienced ghost - hunter , intersperses original matter in the way of explanation and suggestion , and gives to his book that serious and plausible air which will make it all the more acceptable to the class of readers naturally attracted by its title .

		An appendix is devoted to '' the phantom armies seen in
France	LOCATION	, '' and another to '' historical ghosts . ''

		A short bibliography of miscellaneous ghost literature closes the book .

		All scholars interested in folk-song , all Middle - Westerners , and all who enjoy things human , should find much instructive entertainment in a new number of the ''
Nebraska Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	and Folk Lore Series . ''

		Miss
Louise Pound	PERSON	, Associate Professor of the English Language in the Uni - versity of
Nebraska	LOCATION	, has prepared a syllabus of '' The Folk-song of
Nebraska	LOCATION	and the Central West , '' which will be followed later by a complete collection of words and music .

		There is consid - erable technical value in this collection , providing as it does material for the study of the variations in common folk-songs .

		Besides this , the indig - enous songs , such as '' I Want to be a Cowboy , '' '' The Little Log Shanty on the Claim , '' '' Bury Me Not on the Prairie , '' `` The Horse Wrangler , '' '' The
Kinkaider	PERSON	's Song , '' and the famous dog - gerel of the
Cat Creek Glee Club	ORGANIZATION	, give the pam - phlet an interest that will not fail to appeal to the general reader .

		is
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He who stood aside from the world , to whom the ordinary employments of man - kind were unsubstantial and visionary , kept his heart open to books until the last .

		Imagi - nation took the place of action with him , as it does with a boy .

		To the most of us , how - ever , reading for enjoyment is only possible in youth .

		Afterward we read for knowledge , or to get some profit for our labor , or at least to acquire that ineffable consciousness of superiority to hoi polloi which does not read .

		But the wild ecstacy of our earliest acquaintance with books , the intoxications , orgies , debauches of imagination by which we accompany and supplement our reading , can hardly be recaptured .

		Only the creative artist , perhaps , though moving behind the scenes amid the pulleys and trap doors of the stage , can retain enough of the innocence of youth to believe in the make-believe that is presented to the front of the house .

		My parents were worshippers of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, so that my boyhood was ruled by those large luminaries .

		There could hardly have been better or more beneficent influ - ences .

		Imagine a petty and desiccated child - hood developing under the auspices of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, or a dwarfed and repulsive growth under the malign powers of the modern real - ists .

		My mother had various portfolios of engravings and pictures of the
Waverley	LOCATION	and Byronic epoch .

		Before I could read I was familiar with the names and faces of the heroes and heroines of that literature , and carried them about in my mind for imitation or admiration : I wore the vestments of the men and the livery of the ladies .

		I remem - ber , too .

		an enormously extended life of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon full of vividly colored prints , which one drew out accordion-fashion , depicting pretty nearly all the chief incidents in the career of the Conqueror .

		After all .

		the Moving-Picture - bred boy of to-day has not so much the advan - tage of our older generation , for we could pore over our pictures by the hour and recur to them again and again until we knew them by heart .

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	My parents had the habit , which I suppose is common enough ; of attaching imaginary personalities to real ones .

		Such an acquain - tance was
Quilp	PERSON	or
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	or the Antiquary .

		If I did anything creditable I was
Mark Tapley	PERSON	, '' coming out strong . ''

		There was thus always a coming and going of ideal figures in our house .

		As soon as I began to read for myself I set to work to construct them and their regions even more strongly .

		My father was a soldier and a mighty hunter , and so I had a great store of leaden bullets of various sizes and shapes .

		With these , on the cartography of the carpet , I laid out the scenes and worked out the plots of my romances and novels as fast as I read them .

		Or in my long and lonely walks it was no trouble for me to displace the streets or landscapes that I saw and substitute in their stead the houses and country scenes of my book-fed vision .

		Side by side with the larger lords of fiction I have named came
Cooper	PERSON	and all his com - peers of wood and wave .

		I probably made no critical distinction between the literary masterpiece and the dime novel .

		Both .

		were good if they could be worked over in imagina - tive play .

		What a debt I must have owed to
Mayne Reid !	ORGANIZATION

		There is hardly one of his adventures that I have not re-enacted in fancy a score of times .

		Books of travel and exploration , arctic , tropic , mountain , con - tinental , all were magnificent fuel for my imagination 's fire .

		Of course I am aware that this is the common experience of youth ; but because it is common it proves that that is the period of imaginative enjoyment .

		Some of my preoccupations might have been peculiar .

		I remember the fascination which the idea of that arctic food , pemmican , had for me .

		In all my dream wanderings in the
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	region or the Fur Country , that edible accom - panied me .

		I was living on the fat of the land in my comfortable home ; but nothing , it seemed to me , could be quite as good as pem - mican .

		Alas , I have never tasted pemmican !

		One other ideal food of my boyhood , jerked beef , the carne seco of the Southern plains , I have eaten .

		To my sorrow , I have been forced to subsist on it for considerable periods .

		It consists of the flesh of beef , or some other animal , cut into thin strips , dried in the sun , and then rolled up in masses in the hide .

		Under the tropic sun it soon acquires a pro- nounced flavor and potency of life ; but it is nutritious and a hungry man is not choice .

		Perhaps pemmican would be equally disap - pointing .

		My first poet was Scott . ''

		The Lady of the Lake '' was read to me by my mother before I was twelve years old ; and I immediately borrowed a lead-pencil and some paper and started an epic of my own on similar lines .

		That was always the effect of verse on me .

		Prose started me to imaginary imitation of its action , poetry to an attempted reproduc - tion of the form .

		Description , images , fine writing in prose , I loathed , and always skipped .

		Set to the motion and tunes of verse , they lassoed me and drew me captive after them .

		I do not think I thought myself into the characters and scenes of poetry .

		It was an
Eden	ORGANIZATION	protected from entrance by a flaming sword ; but I soon discovered that it was an
Eden	ORGANIZATION	built up out of words , and I set myself to discover their secret .

		Pope and
Shelley	PERSON	were the next poets who unfolded themselves to my infant mind .

		I read and re-read them sedulously , though what I made out of their moralities or anti-moralities is more than I can say now .

		Shelley did con - vert me to vegetarianism , and made me a nuisance in the household for some time .

		We had no copy of
Keats	PERSON	, and I first found him in my first circulating library , bound up in one volume with the poems of
Mary Howitt	PERSON	and
Dean Milman	PERSON	.

		I took the book out so often that the librarian must have thought these improving authors most attractive to me .

		I read them , of course , for what were books printed for except to be read ?

		But I heeded them not .

		The spell of
Keats	PERSON	was upon me , the vision and revelation of the wonders of expression .

		Keats , too , served me as a gateway to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		I had read a few of the master 's plays before , in an un - knowing way ; but
Keats	PERSON	discovered to me their technique , and for many years I almost buried myself in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		I read him sitting at a desk , curled up on a sofa , flat on the floor , on my head , nearly , lying down - ward on a stairway .

		I read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	him - self , and all the critics and commentators .

		a library of them .

		Since I came of age I can hardly be said to have recurred to such read - ing .

		Unless one wants to be one of the '' train attendant , '' it is best not to frequent too much the court of great kings .

		However ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 99 I did for many years constitute myself a slave or courtier of Shakespeare in his theatri - cal guise .

		Stage exhibitions are perhaps the most enjoyable form of reading .

		They lack the perfection of the inner realizations of the mind ; but their overwhelming vividness of presentation , their life , color , and vibrant tones , stamp even deeper impressions .

		How much enjoyment is associated with the reading incidental to schoolwork , remains a j question .

		Slowly to dig out a few pages of Homer or Virgil by the help of dictionary \ and crib , is not an entrancing occupation .

		Of course such work gives one the key to future conquests .

		I did not go far in this direction in my youth , but I went far enough to realize that there were '' livers out of
Britain	LOCATION	'' ; that there were vast treasures out - side of English literature .

		After the first flush of the experience of i books is past , probably the best way to re - ' cover some sense of freshness and newness in j intellectual matters is to change ground entirely , leave the cultivated and floriated regions of imaginative literature for a time , and get among the crags and rocks of harder studies . ''

		How charming is divine philoso - phy ! ''

		sings
Milton	LOCATION	.

		Its portals and windows are gray and forbidding enough from the out - side , but from within they are flooded with light and color .

		For four or five years in my early manhood I fed almost exclusively on metaphysics , , and would have laughed at any one who thought its Barmecide banquets un - satisfactory .

		No lollipops for me when I could get syllogisms !

		What was any novel or romance to a Dialogue of Plato or a Trea - tise of Kant ?

		Metaphysics is the royal game of the mind .

		It imposes itself upon life and literature , which are both largely what it decrees .

		It is a cyclone whose circumference sweeps everything in its vortex , but at whose centre there is peace and quiet .

		The sciences , too , or some of them , astron - omy , geology , biology , are capable of bring - ing back to the mind its
spring	DATE	, its keen and devouring interest in things .

		As for law ,
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	is as readable as a novel .

		Almost everything of human interest is in the book , | customs , habits , adventures , marriage matters , I money affairs , and innumerable hangings .

		But in the end , verse lasts best .

		The hurly - burly of the happenings of life seems to have little plan or order , and they plagiarize each other shamelessly , as do the prose books which repeat them .

		But the movement and music of verse do seem to have something in them of the primal or final harmony of the universe .

		After all , reading to any great extent , or any great enjoyment of reading , is hardly compatible with the work and doings of actual life .

		`` If rum interferes with your business , '' says an old quip , `` give up your business . ''

		I am afraid it is that way with reading .

		We can hardly fully inherit the ideal and the real worlds at the same time .

		THE SECOND GEORGIAN POETRY BOOK .

		SOME MAGAZINES AFFECTED BY THE WAR . ''

		FORM , '' A NEW ENGLISH QUARTERLY .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		New books have been rather more interest - ing since I last wrote .

		Several good things of various kinds came out toward the end of the autumn season , and the
spring	DATE	season opens this week with the appearance of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's '' These Twain , '' which you have already seen .

		At the moment the Press is agitated over the '' Spoon River Anthology '' which , until we saw it , we had presumed to be a collection of verses by some brotherhood of young poets who had formed a Pantisocratic community on the bosky banks of the mean - dering Spoon , where under the friendly heaven , they reconciled the claims of Art and Nature by cultivating the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	and the Potato .

		We were wrong .

		How wrong I need scarcely explain to readers who will be already familiar with the
Gestes	PERSON	and Sayinges of the shades of
Tennessee Claflin Shope	PERSON	, Wm.
Lloyd Garrison Standard	PERSON	,
Wendell P. Bloyd	PERSON	,
Henry C. Calhoun	PERSON	, and Hod Putt whose name runs Boy Ed close as an example of monosyllabic compression .

		Some people here are enthusi - astic about Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's exposure of the human race ; others , amongst whom I count myself , think that the readableness of his book is largely accounted for by the originality of his idea of -LRB- I do n't use the phrase in an offen - sive way -RRB- plying the muck-rake in a cemetery .

		A sane view was expressed , I think , by an English author who said that Mr.
Masters	PERSON	was an
American Masefield	ORGANIZATION	with more sense than Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, but a smaller poetic gift .

		It is possible that some earnest student of literature mav illustrate the whole difference 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3 between the twentieth century	DATE	and the eight - eenth by comparing Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's observa - tions in a
Churchyard	LOCATION	with those of Thomas Gray .

		`` From Stoke Poges to Spoon River : An Appraisement of Relative Values '' : surely the book must already be in course of composi - tion .

		This idea , I am happy to say , would not have occurred to me in the normal way ; but I have just been reading Dr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	's new Gray letters published in what may fairly claim to be the most important volumes of the season '' The Correspondence of Gray ,
Wai	PERSON	- pole , West and Ashton '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Gray is certainly one of the best of En - glish letter - writers .

		Cowper who had had no opportunity of reading
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's let - ters and modestly failed to foresee the opinion that posterity would hold as to his own said he was the best . ''

		I once thought . ''

		he wrote -LRB- to
Joseph Hill	PERSON	in
1777	DATE	-RRB- , '' Swift 's letters the best that could be written ; but I like Gray 's better .

		His humour , or his wit , or whatever it is to be called , is never ill-natured or offen - sive , and yet , I think equally poignant with the Dean 's . ''

		In Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	's collection of the letters exchanged between the members of the Etonian '' Quadruple Alliance , '' there are nearly a hundred of Gray 's which have never before been published , and they are as good as the old ones .

		The high-spirited jokes of this most solemn of poets contrast curiously with the refined and polished humor of
Walpole	LOCATION	: one letter from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, burlesquing the trivialities of ordinary correspondence , fin - ishes up with `` My Duck has eat a Snail . ''

		The early letters give a pleasing picture of the stagnancy of the eighteenth century universi - ties .

		West went to
Oxford	LOCATION	, the other three to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and though their letters as fresh - men are , no doubt , rather affected in their boredom , such letters could scarcely have been written in an age when the universities were enjoying a vigorous life .

		West describes Ox - ford as a place '' flowing with syllogisms and ale , where
Horace	PERSON	and
Virgil	PERSON	are equally un - known '' and Gray writes of Cambridge : '' The Masters of Colledges are twelve grey - hair 'd Gentlefolks , who are all mad with Pride ; the Fellows are sleepy , drunken , dull , illiterate Things ; the Fellow Com : are imitatours of the Fellows , or else Beaux , or else nothing : the Pen - sion : -LRB- i. e. Pensioners -RRB- grave , formal Sots , who would be thought old , or else drink Ale , and sing Songs against y e Excise .

		The Sizers are Graziers ' Eldest Sons , who come to get good Learning , that they may all be Archbishops of Canterbury . ''

		There are some new
Walpole	LOCATION	letters , but these j are a drop in the ocean of
Horace	ORGANIZATION	's remains .

		The new Georgian Poetry book , a companion volume to `` Georgian Poetry .

		1911-12 , '' has appeared ; and if it is not quite as good as its predecessor it contains some very beautiful lyrics by
Walter de la Mare	ORGANIZATION	,
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, D. II .

		Lawrence ,
Ralph Hodgson	PERSON	,
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	, and
J. E. Flecker	PERSON	.

		The longest things in the volume are two plays by Mr.
Lascelles Abercrombie	PERSON	and Mr.
Gordon Bottomley	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	's '' The End of the World '' is a laborious failure ; Mr.
Bottomley	PERSON	's ''
King Lear	PERSON	's Wife '' is , although full of distinguished writing , scarcely the '' better half '' of ''
King Lear	PERSON	. ''

		The .

		Queen dies while her husband makes love to her handmaid in the death - chamber ;
Goneril	LOCATION	, a virgin huntress , murders the handmaid ; and the Queen 's body is washed by a crone who accompanies the ablu - tion with a song beginning : '' A louse crept out of my lady 's shift Ahemm ,
Ahumni	LOCATION	, Ahee , Crying ' Oi !

		Oi !

		We are turned adrift The lady 's bosom is cold and stiffed , And her arm-pit 's cold for me . ' ''

		When the play was produced the other day the Censor , with his usual sensitiveness , knocked out this song ; but the audience , I imagine , found the rest of it quite enough to stomach .

		It is not a good play : its horrors are laid on and its characters are unreal .

		But its author is one of the most ambitious and origi - nal of the younger poets , and nothing he could do would be unmitigatedly bad .

		The
Chicago Repertory	ORGANIZATION	people might have a look at it if they want a change .

		So far , the war has not killed as many papers as one had expected it would includ - ing trade-journals , which I do not as a rule read but which I understand have fallen '' like the leaves of the forest when
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	hath blown . ''

		But Mr.
Scott-James	PERSON	's twopenny literary journal the `` New Weekly '' `` became a casualty '' -LRB- as they say at the front -RRB- early in the war ; '' Poetry and Drama '' -LRB- a periodical which , in its short career published much of the best work of the younger poets -RRB- has suc - cumbed , though its spirit lives in hopes of a later re-incarnation ; `` Notes and Queries '' has been seriously , though one trusts not mor - tally , wounded and is calling out for help ; and now the `` Athenaeum , '' a seamed and bronzed veteran , has found the tussle a little too hot and been compelled to retire to more favorable ground .

		After running as a weekly for the best part of a century , and sur - viving the curses of the countless bad writers and inaccurate scholars whose withers it has wrung , the `` Athenaeum '' has decided to ap - pear once a month instead of once a week .

		Its articles , one gathers , will still be principally book reviews , but will approximate in length to those in the other monthlies .

		One of the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 most striking things about the old `` Athe - naeum '' has always been the almost complete anonymity of its contents , many of the best known of English literary men having con - tributed without signing .

		Its present editor , Mr.
Vernon Kendall	PERSON	, is a
Cambridge	LOCATION	man , a fine classical scholar with a puckish wit and an extraordinary knowledge of the holes and cor - ners of literature .

		At such a time one certainly would not have expected anyone to have the audaeity to bring out a. new paper devoted exclusively to the arts .

		But such a paper is at present in gesta - tion , and the first number is expected in
March	DATE	.

		It is to be a quarterly , its name will be '' Form '' : its editors are Mr.
Austin	PERSON	Spare -LRB- one of the best of the younger draughtsmen -RRB- and Mr.
Francis Marsden	PERSON	; and it will be com - posed partly of original drawings and partly of creative work in verse and prose .

		Messrs.
Charles Ricketts	PERSON	,
Charles Shannon	PERSON	, and Ed - mund
J. Sullivan	PERSON	are all taking an interest in it ; Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	is contributing a number of poems to the first issue ; and many other eminent persons have promised to help .

		But its principal object will be the publication of the young : and its existence will be justified , -LRB- or the reverse -RRB- , by the degree of its success in getting good work from men whose reputations are not yet established .

		One thing is certain : it will be one of the most beautifully `` pro- duced '' papers we have ever had .

		I have seen advanced sheets .

		The page is large : the type beautiful : and the text is throughout -LRB- as our ancestors would have put it -RRB- `` embellished with cuts '' head-pieces , tail-pieces , and elaborate initial letters .

		Whatever the qual - ity of the contents , therefore and there is reason to hope that it may be good it seems likely that '' Form '' will inevitably become a '' collector 's item . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		PUBLISHERS ' ETHICS seem to those of mature years to have been on a higher plane '' in the good old days '' than in this latter age .

		The late
Frank H. Dodd	PERSON	, of whom many good things are being said of late , was in moral standards as well as in business ability an ornament to his calling .

		The house of which j he was so long the distinguished head that !

		of
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	held it little short of J dishonorable to make approaches of a pro- i fessional nature to the authors of another publishing house .

		In harmony with this up - rightness of principle was Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	's action in a little occurrence related by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		When the now flourishing firm in
Franklin Square	LOCATION	had fallen on evil days and there seemed to the veteran novelist no other course open to him but to seek another publisher , he went to Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	with the first chapter of what afterward became '' The Kentons '' and offered the novel for publication .

		Naturally the offer was gladly accepted ; but soon the sky cleared in
Franklin Square	LOCATION	, and it became evident that no severance of relations be - tween Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and the Harpers would be necessary or advisable .

		This cheering devel - opment caused the greatly relieved novelist some embarrassment , but he went again to Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	and stated the situation frankly , asking to be released from his engagement .

		As he himself has narrated the incident , '' in business , which the ignorant think altogether sordid , many delicate and generous things are done , and I could never forget the terms of this eminent publisher 's compliance with my suggestion , or the wish for my profit and pleasure in the renewal of my old relations with
Franklin Square	ORGANIZATION	which he so cordially expressed . ''

		One saying of Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	's , which does him great credit and illustrates his ideal - ism , his loftiness of motive , is this : '' I think we ought to publish every year twenty or thirty books of which we know in advance that they can not possibly pay , but of which we feel sure that they will be a credit to our house . ''

		That such a publisher should have won to himself many authors who were both a credit to the house and a source of hand - some profit , is not surprising .

		TlIE FIRST PINE CARELESS RAPTURE OVER SHAKESPEARE , such as is known to those who have had the good fortune in early life to stumble upon and read the plays before hear - ing anything or reading anything about them , is rather more difficult to recapture than that expressed in the song of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's wise thrush .

		This handicap * of portentous celeb - rity , of unapproachable greatness , is suffered , as has often been remarked , by other works of literature besides
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's writings most notably of all by the
Bible	LOCATION	, and in hardly lesser measure by Homer .

		Virgil .

		Dante , and
Milton	PERSON	, too , tend to repel by their excess of fame ; they are introduced to the young reader as something more than human .

		Vividly does the present writer recall the warm human interest that infused , for him , the Old Testament stories that were read to him at a very early age before any knowledge had come to him of a great book called the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The listening and re-listening to those stories in the King James version was an 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	unending delight , marred only by an occa - sional attempt at paraphrase or abridgment on the reader 's part .

		Something of this de - light was apparently felt by the young attendants at a Shakespeare performance recently mentioned in the columns of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times . ''

		The writer says : '' Con - spicuous among the
St. James	LOCATION	's audience were a row or two of schoolgirls , who , lucky crea - tures , were evidently making their first acquaintance with ' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	' on the stage .

		They went into fits of laughter when poor , blind , old
Gobbo	PERSON	mistook
Launce	LOCATION	- lot 's back hair for a beard , and shrilly ap - plauded when
Portia	LOCATION	so ingeniously turned the tables upon the bloodthirsty Shylock .

		That is the way we should all try to enjoy our Shakespeare , if we were wise , instead of making a fuss over new ' readings ' or minute details of mise-en-scene .

		The trouble is that at every successive Shakespearean perform - ance a long vista of previous recollections gets in the way of our simple pleasure and spoils what should have been a whole-hearted sur - render to the romance or the fierce passion or the mere fun of the moment . ''

		Not so , however , with all of us , especially if we belong to that exalted company known as the gallery gods .

		To them the play is the thing , irrespec - tive of any stage traditions relating to its presentation .

		LIBRARIANS ' SHOP-TALK OF HALF A CENTURY AGO , or fifty-two years and
four months ago	DATE	, to be exact , is to be found , by those curious in such matters , in the '' Proceedings of the Librarians ' Convention Held in
New York City	LOCATION
September 15	DATE	, 16 , and 17 ,
1853	DATE	, '' now reprinted by the
Torch Press of Cedar Rap	ORGANIZATION	- ids ,
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The call for this first meeting of American librarians was issued in
May , 1853	DATE	, and was signed by
Charles Folsom	PERSON	of the Bos - ton Athenaeum ,
C. C. Jewett	PERSON	of the
Smith	ORGANIZATION	- sonian Institution , ``
William F. Poole	PERSON	of the
Boston Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Lloyd P. Smith	PERSON	of the Library Company of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and others either professionally engaged in library work or disinterestedly zealous in promoting the growth and multiplication of libraries accessible to the public .

		At the conference resulting from this call there were present eighty men from thirteen States .

		Forty-seven libraries were represented , containing collec - tively more than six hundred thousand vol - umes .

		The entire absence of women from this gathering is to us of the present day a nota - ble feature , but probably not one of those male delegates had the faintest dream of the preponderance of the other sex at future meetings of the same sort .

		Among subjects discussed prominence was given to the diffi - culties and perplexities of maintaining any adequate catalogue of a growing collection of books , the inadequacies of the printed list being pointed out and some system of cumu - lative cataloguing by means of separate stereotype plates for the successively added titles being recommended a fruitful sugges - tion , as we now know .

		But the very simple and to us obvious card-catalogue idea was not yet conceived .

		Book-classification , in its crude beginnings , was discussed , and '' a copy of a new index to the Periodical Literature of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	was exhibited to the Convention '' the author being , of course , he whose name has appeared on the back of so many successive supplements to that index .

		And all this took place twenty-three years before our library workers finally succeeded in forming a permanent organization to safe - guard and promote their interests .

		Some future periodic assembling of librarians was hoped for by this pioneer conference , but it seems to have been a hope deferred .

		A HALF-CENTURY 'S RECORD OF GOOD LIT - ERARY WORK was closed with the death , on
Jan. 17	DATE	, of
Jeannette Leonard Gilder	PERSON	, who has told her own story so well , with such charm of romance thrown about the dry bones of fact , in '' The Autobiography of a
Tom	PERSON	- boy '' and '' The Tomboy at Work , '' that the reader need only be referred to those volumes for an essentially lifelike portrait of her vivid personality and a chronicle of her some - what multiform achievements in letters , and in some other branches of eager effort .

		Not quite half a century , to be exact , is covered by her literary activity ; for she began writing as a journalist in
Newark	LOCATION	at eighteen years of age , and she had left her sixty-sixth birthday not quite three months behind when death suddenly overtook her in her
New York	LOCATION	home .

		Her work on the
Newark	LOCATION	`` Morning
Regis	PERSON	- ter , '' the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune '' and `` Herald , '' the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript '' and ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Gazette , '' the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	`` Press '' and `` Record , '' the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' and the
London	LOCATION	'' Academy , '' made her known , first and last , to thousands of appreciative readers .

		With her brother
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	she was associated in the editorship of the old `` Scribner 's Monthly '' -LRB- afterward `` The Century '' -RRB- ; and with another brother ,
Joseph B. Gilder	PERSON	, she ably conducted '' The Critic , '' which was later merged with the resuscitated '' Putnam 's Magazine . ''

		In addi - tion to all this activity she wrote plays and magazine stories , was co-editor of various vol -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 103 urnes of prose and verse , established '' The Reader , '' which she conducted as an aid to book-buyers , and was widely known as author of the two autobiographical productions named above , and also of '' Taken by Siege . ''

		Of her early work in book-reviewing she her - self has told us very agreeably how , by
Kate Field	PERSON	's advice , she adopted the dialogue form and '' had a family take up the books of the day and discuss them , giving various opin - ions : the sons and daughters maintaining a point that was immediately bowled over by I the father .

		My ' Chats about Books ' became J a popular feature of the paper .

		Publishers offered to put them into book form , and they attained the importance of being burlesqued by the inimitable Xym Crinkle .

		He called his burlesque ' The Drivel Family , ' and I am sure that it was well named . ''

		FORTY YEARS OF OUR OLDEST COMIC JOURNAL will be rounded out on the seventh of this month , when '' The Harvard Lampoon '' com - pletes its fourth decade of mirthful existence .

		Naturally the occasion revives memories and traditions of the literary frolic entered into by the half-dozen or more students who , one day in
January , 1876	DATE	.

		met in
Samuel Sher	PERSON	- wood 's room in
Matthews Hall	PERSON	and outlined a plan for the publication , if even for only a single issue , of a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	`` Punch . ''

		But that initial number proved so hilarious a suc - cess that no further encouragement was want - ing to persuade the editors to continue as they had begun .

		Among those pioneers in the cause of wholesome college humor are found the names of Mr.
Edward S. Martin	PERSON	, now associated with a still more widely known though seven years younger comic paper -LRB- `` Life '' -RRB- , and the late
Edmund M. Wheel	PERSON	- wright , architect of the present home of the publication he helped to start .

		Other notable contributors to the early success of '' Lampy '' were Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	-LRB- who brought out in its pages his `` Little Tin Gods on Wheels '' -RRB- , Mr.
Owen Wist	PERSON	er .

		Mr.
Lloyd McKim Garrison	PERSON	.

		Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Frederic Jessup Stimson	PERSON	.

		and Mr.
John T. Wheel	PERSON	- wright , the last-named still mirthfully associ - ated with his `` Rollo 's Journey to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, '' one of the paper 's most brilliant successes .

		In
1880	DATE	occurred a brief period of suspended animation , but publication was resumed after a six months ' interval and has continued with - out interruption ever since .

		To-day , with a building of its own , though not yet quite paid for , and apparently no decline in its excel - lence and popularity , this '' '
Charivari	LOCATION	'' of our oldest university may be regarded as a permanent institution .

		At any rate , so bright a representative of college journalism ought to have a perennial existence .

		POLITE LETTERS AND MILITARY TRAINING have so little in common that the present ten - dency to bring them together in our colleges and universities may well excite protest .

		At
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, where many students have enrolled themselves for soldierly drill , this amateur effort to further the cause of '' preparedness '' is not viewed by President
Lowell	PERSON	with un - qualified approval .

		Rather the contrary .

		He says , in the course of his annual report : '' The question of military instruction in term time is more difficult .

		A popular impression still survives that drill , comprising the man - ual of arms and evolutions in small bodies , is the main point in military training .

		It is , of course , essential , but it forms a very minute part of the education of an officer ; and it is quickly learned , as anyone who has visited the students ' camps must have observed .

		More - over , it had much better be taught under military conditions like those in a camp or in the militia , rather than in student organiza - tions at a college which is not primarily a military school .

		Constant drill in a hall or on an athletic field is artificial , monotonous , and wearisome , tending to produce an aver - sion for military training instead of an inter - est in the real problems with which an officer must deal . ''

		Certain military studies that might be pursued as electives , supplementary to field training at
summer	DATE	camps , are named , but only in a tentative , suggestive way .

		To urge a student to enter upon the study of the science of human butchery might seem to in - volve some such risks as , according to Pope , accompany the too frequent viewing of the face of vice .

		, , A YEAR 'S LIBRARY LEGISLATION is summa - rized by Mr.
William R. Eastman	PERSON	in a report lately submitted to the
New York Library Association	ORGANIZATION	and now published in `` The Library Journal '' -LRB-
January	DATE	issue -RRB- .

		It ap - pears that in
1915	DATE	one hundred and three bills affecting libraries were presented in the legislatures of thirty-one states and in Con - gress : and of these fifty-eight became law .


West Virginia	LOCATION	passed a general library law empowering a municipality to establish and maintain a public library by taxation .

		No other general law of this nature was enacted , though efforts to that end were made in
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania and
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		No additional state library commission was created , though at - tempts are recorded in
West Virginia	LOCATION	and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		Kansas raised its tax limit for 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	libraries in cities of fewer than forty thou - sand inhabitants , making the maximum half a mill on the dollar instead of four-tenths of a mill .

		County-library systems were adopted by
Texas	LOCATION	and
Montana	LOCATION	; but in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, and
Arizona	LOCATION	, county-library bills were defeated .

		In
Ohio	LOCATION	and
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	amendments to existing county-library laws were adopted .

		The cause of the legislative reference library was pro- moted in
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and else - where .

		Travelling libraries and school libraries were the subjects of some progressive legis - lation , and retirement pensions for super - annuated librarians were considered by the law-makers of
Ohio	LOCATION	and
Michigan	LOCATION	, but the consideration proved unfavorable .

		Among bills of a foolish and impracticable nature , precedence must be accorded to the
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts proposal that every book returned from circulation should be disinfected or sterilized before going out again .

		The bill failed of passage .

		On the whole , it was a year of progress in wise law-making for the public library , as will appear more unmistakably upon perusal of Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's report in full .

		MB .

		MASEFIELD IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	becomes an ob - ject of considerably more curiosity and inter - est to us than Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	.

		Though English-born , he might be claimed by us as half - American ; for it was from our | shores that he set forth , some fifteen years ago , to win his present place in the world of letters .

		Scorning school and books in boy - hood , he seems to have driven his parents well-nigh to distraction by his errant ways .

		At any rate , he was finally indentured to the captain of a merchant vessel , apparently as the only means of holding him within some sort of bounds .

		Such a record of wandering by sea and land as next follows can be claimed by no other living poet , if indeed it can be equalled by any biography of poet in the past .

		About the nearest approach to any - thing like formal education in Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's development seems to have been that
summer	DATE	he spent with the poet
Yeats	PERSON	in
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	, `` loafing and talking '' and indulging in the innocent pastime of sailing paper boats -LRB- much as
Shelley	PERSON	used to do , one surmises -RRB- on the placid streams of the neighborhood .

		To be sure , this was informal enough as educational discipline , but it has been regarded as a con - siderable factor in the poet 's training , and there is no reason to doubt it .

		On the whole , no more picturesque and oddly attractive per - sonality has sought our shores from the old world for many a day .

		A FAR NORTHWESTERN WORD IN DEFENCE OF OUR LANGUAGE against the havoc-working in - roads of self-styled reformers comes to our notice and commends itself as worthy of the attention of all to whom `` simplified spell - ing '' is a subject of vital concern .

		The
Portland	LOCATION	'' Oregonian , '' in the course of an able and spirited declaration against the per - nicious activities of the language-tinkers , after referring in general terms to `` the evil of simplified spelling '' and the likelihood that it '' will do nothing more than befuddle the student to a greater extent even than the present-day accepted spelling does , '' contin - ues in similar strain , and thus concludes : '' Incomplete as the English language is , it is the English language , and the most of us would like to have it retain a semblance of its form .

		The radical simplified spelling would do well to apply itself to a new lan - guage , Esperanto , for instance , and leave the dignity of our language undisturbed .

		Correct spelling goes with learning , although many college men are notoriously poor spellers .

		Nevertheless , to have mastered the difficulties of words is a badge of distinction .

		Standard spelling takes into account etymology , orthog - raphy , and phonetics .

		Radical spelling re - form deals almost solely with the last , and not consistently with that . ''

		Standard spell - ing takes into account much more than is here named : it jealously preserves history and poetry and hundreds of associations , most of them precious , many of them , it may be , inti - mately personal , which would be ruthlessly swept away by the zealot to whom simplifica - tion is more than the bread of life .

		ECHOES FROM THE GREAT INTERNATIONA !

		; BOOK-FAIR that so unexpectedly suffered par - tial eclipse from the outbreak of international hostilities have been reverberating through the world ever since those attractive pavilions at
Leipzig	LOCATION	were closed , some of them prema - turely in
August , 1914	DATE	, and the others with more deliberation in
October	DATE	.

		Especially per - sistent has been the rumor that the country which acted as host on that occasion lost no time in confiscating the exhibits of the hostile nations , to the great indignation of the ex - hibitors and their sympathizers .

		Of course denials have been made and have fallen on deaf ears ; but now there comes from the scene of the supposed outrage a press com - munication -LRB- addressed to the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Trib - une '' and printed also in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and perhaps elsewhere as well -RRB- con - tradicting the alleged violation .

		Mr.
Jamas O'Donnell Bennett	PERSON	writes from
Leipzig	LOCATION	that both by inquiry and by ocular evidence he has
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 105 assured himself that the authorities concerned have both taken the utmost care of all exhib - ited property left on their hands when the war-panic sent the custodians flying to their several homes , and have even gone so far as to insure this property against loss or dam - age , paying the insurance charges themselves .

		The whole transaction is most creditable to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		THE YEAR 'S LITERARY HARVEST IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	shows some unmistakable effects of the violent interruption to peaceful activities , but they are less marked than might have been ex - pected .

		While the book-product of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	fell off in
1914	DATE	to the extent of 842 items , with five months of war to ac - count for the decrease , the output for
1915	DATE	, in the face of a whole year of warfare , showed a loss of only 872 as compared with the pre - ceding twelve months ; and this diminution is proportionately greater in new editions than in new books .

		These facts are set forth with clearness and brevity by '' The Publishers ' Circular '' of
London	LOCATION	, which also informs its readers that while fiction shows a decrease of 419 -LRB- the largest of any class -RRB- , science a de - crease of 142 , and technology one of 167 , history has gained 309 , and geography 118 , with lesser gains in several other classes .

		As was remarked last year by the same authority , so this year '' the average quality of the books published ... is probably somewhat lower than during pre-War days , owing partly to a reluctance to place on a disturbed market works requiring a great outlay , and partly to the appearance of numerous ephemeral works dealing with the War . ''

		In view of
England	LOCATION	's frightful losses in young men of the highest attainments and brightest promise , the won - der is she can still make so good a showing .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		HISTORICAL INACCURACIES IN
LONGFEL	LOCATION	- LOW 'S '' EVANGELINE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a letter to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Nation '' -LRB-
Novem	DATE	- ber 6 ,
1884	DATE	, p. 398 -RRB- ,
Francis Parkman	PERSON	quotes another writer who had asserted that '' Most peo - ple when they desire to know the true history of
Acadia	ORGANIZATION	will be content to read
Longfellow	PERSON	, '' and says : '' If so , they will not find what they seek , but in its place , a graceful and touching poem and a charming ideal picture .

		The author of the remark just quoted also adds : ' The history of events is not always the history of humanity . '

		But the history of humanity , to be good for any - thing , must rest , not on imagination , but on truth . ''

		The only authority who can be suggested as having affected
Longfellow	PERSON	's point of view in : `` Evangeline '' is the Abbe
Raynal	PERSON	, whose emo - tional Acadian story is so obviously and intensely prejudiced as hardly to be reckoned an authority .

		The late
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	has dealt in his customary vigorous and incisive style with the treatment by the
Cambridge	LOCATION	poet of
Myles Stan	PERSON	- dish and
Paul Revere	PERSON	.

		Comment can be made as justly upon the unfortunate dealing with facts in his classic poem of '' Evangeline '' concerning the expatriation from Grand Pre , especially as an unavailing effort has been made to have these sug - gestions incorporated by foot-notes in popular editions of the poem .

		There are indeed some gen - eral observations in the preface of certain of these editions which might suggest the fact that the poem is not a history , but there are no corrections of definite mis-statements .

		Aside from the fact that nobody reads a preface , the antidote should be immediately connected with the passages which require it .

		This historical vindication is made the more necessary by the presentation of a dramatic ver - sion of '' Evangeline '' not long ago in
New York	LOCATION	, with an announcement made upon its programme , under the authority of a committee of the Depart - ment of Education of that city , stating that Long - fellow '' translated history into poetry , '' and that '' for his facts he turned to records , '' and that the commanding officer 's proclamation , testifying to the disagreeableness of his duty in causing the removal of the people and his hopes for a good future for them , was '' cruel irony , '' and charac - terizing the separation of Gabriel and
Evangeline	PERSON	as '' typical '' and not exceptional .

		These state - ments , though unexpected from an official body , quite represent a popular opinion -LRB- which was shared by the present writer in his youthful ad - miration for the poem -RRB- .

		The removal of the Acadians from Grand Pre can not be thus con - demned , like the expatriation of the Belgians , nor can the commander of the expedition be classed with the lieutenants of
Alva	PERSON	in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	and of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Admiring appreciation of the poetic gifts of imagination in the author of `` Evangeline '' must be conceded to the creation of the pictures of nature therein , since
Longfellow	PERSON	had not visited Grand Pre or the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, but trusted , as we are told , to descriptions by others and to
Banvard	ORGANIZATION	's panorama .

		Though the actual history of the de - portation had not been widely made known when the poem was written ,
Winslow	PERSON	's '' Journal '' was as accessible to one who was himself a member of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	as it is now to members , and indeed , through its generous cour - tesy , to any student .

		Let us now consider in detail some of the specific passages in which
Longfellow	LOCATION	has substi - tuted for history a popular myth of his own creating 1 . ''

		Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers , Dwelt in the love of God and of man . ''

		The settlement had been a nest of traitors .

		If it `` dwelt in the love of God and of man , '' it cer - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	tainly did not dwell in the love of the men of the English colonies .

		Plots and plans for raids by French and Indians were so incessant that at last the choice of expatriation or the taking of the oath of allegiance mentioned in the next note became inevitable . ''

		The expulsion of the Acadians may seem to us a cruel act , but it was forced upon the English by the hardest necessity , the necessity of self - protection ; and in spite of all that has since been written to the con - trary , no impartial student of history can perceive in what other way than the deportation of these irrecon - cilables could the peace of
New Scotland	LOCATION	have been assured , a peace which has lasted to this day . ''

		What their design may be is unknown ; but all are commanded On the morrow to meet in the church . ''

		The design for which the '' simple Acadian farmers '' were ordered to assemble must have been pretty well known to them , pace the poet 's assumption .

		Though twice confirmed British sub - jects by the
Treaty of Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	and that of Aix-la -
Chapelle	LOCATION	, they had repeatedly refused to take an oath of allegiance which English officials were too weak to enforce until
1730	DATE	, when Governor Gen - eral
Richard Phillips	PERSON	brought over with him the following form , to which he secured general sub - scription : '' Je promets et jure sincerement en foi de Chretien que je serai entierement fidele et obeirai vraiment Sa Majeste le
Roi George le Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond , que je reconnais pour le Soverain Seigneur de 1 ' Acadie ou
Nouvelle Ecosse	ORGANIZATION	.


Ainsi Dieu	ORGANIZATION	me soit en aide . ''

		Nevertheless , the Acadians after - wards maintained that Governor
Phillips	PERSON	had verbally made reservations by which they were per - mitted to remain '' neutrals '' ; and they were sum - moned on five occasions between
1749	DATE	and
1755	DATE	to renew the oath , repudiating the alleged reserva - tions , to which , however , they stubbornly adhered , though they had been explicitly and repeatedly forewarned of the consequences the forfeiture of their lands and their removal . ''

		That the application of the term '' quaint '' to Chaucer betokens a superficial acquaintance with the poet is the dictum recently enunciated by a leading Chaucerian scholar . ''

		The ancients did not know that they were ancient . ''

		Great art can - not be quaint .

		Perhaps it is only in self-defence that I venture to differ .

		Is it not really legitimate to feel that certain art is '' quaint '' ?

		Does only the superfi - cial student detect a quaint something in Chaucer ?

		Does not the whole matter come back to the point of view ?

		Any phenomenon in nature the odor of jas - mine , for instance , is not quite the same to you as to me .

		To a slight difference in mere denota - tion , due to idiosyncracies in our olfactory nerves , add the difference in connotation due to the differ - ences in the environment and experience of our lives , and one must be impressed by the varieties of appeal that a single natural phenomenon may make to various human beings .

		To one who en - counters jasmine for the first time , it gives forth merely a rich ; delightful fragrance or , possibly , not delightful ; to another , born and bred amid jasmine , the fragrance brings with it clouds of memories and romance .

		A familiar landscape is sweet and restful ; foreign scenery piques and stimulates .

		A view in
Japan	LOCATION	is two quite different things to an American and to a Japanese .

		The appeal of its beauty to the two beholders may be equal , but can not be identical ; for to the one it is native , to the other alien .

		Differences in the impressions produced by nature , however , are not so striking as in those produced by the human elements in scenery .

		Physiognomy , costume , habitations , monuments of architecture are either familiar or strange : and this fact greatly intensifies the difference between the impressions produced by a Japanese scene upon a native and upon a foreigner .

		If one in - cludes less tangible elements of the human sort language , customs , habits of thought all the more does the appeal of things Japanese to an American diverge from their appeal to a native of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Now , it is just these elements , natural and human , which enter into the composition of art .

		To a person of our race there must needs appear in a Japanese painting something strange and curious , a beauty unknown and alien .

		The natural and human differences have been magnified in passing through the mind of the artist , with its Japanese habits of thought , and we feel with redoubled force an appeal unlike that with which we are familiar and at home .

		Whether the art be painting , sculpture , architecture , music , or litera - ture , this flavor of the Asiatic and the Japanesque must reach us as it can not possibly reach a native Japanese .

		The Japanese soul is , in the object of art , a soul differentiated by centuries of develop - ment from that of the American .

		Only by trans - muting himself into a Japanese may the American feel Japanese art as it is felt by the native of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		How difficult if not impossible is such transmutation of personality appears in such striking persons as Kipling and
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		These writers never became Japanese or Hindu : on the contrary , their very sensitiveness to the alien and exotic flavor of Japanese and Hindu life and art enabled them to act as intermediaries between the
East	LOCATION	and the
West	LOCATION	.

		No man may one be so dogmatic ?

		can ever be native to both hemispheres .

		So it is , likewise , if we move backward in time instead of stepping across the world in space .

		No twentieth-century reader of Homer will register the same impression of the Iliad as was made upon the mind of an Homeric Greek or of
Peri	ORGANIZATION	- cles .

		No one can now read

		mind and heart .

		Neither can any reader quite cease to be of his own generation as he cons the charming lines of Chaucer .

		Let him become as familiar as he can with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's language , style , rhythm , thought , personality , environment , still there remain in the background of consciousness Shakespeare and all the moderns to forbid the complete abolishment of the perspective of time .

		Chaucer to the scholar of to-day is not quite the beloved master of
Lydgate	ORGANIZATION	and
Occleve	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be sure , this tertium quid , the resultant of the inter - action of two personalities far separated in time , the writer and the reader , must be much less pronounced in the case of a mature scholar than in that of a beginner in mediaeval literature .

		Yet it can not wholly vanish .

		Call the quality of this appeal '' quaintness , '' or what you will , is it to be lamented ?

		Well , that depends .

		In reading a writer so great that his thought , style , and personality are worthy of eter - nal remembrance , a sense of strangeness may be a hindrance to our highest enjoyment and profit .

		Dante we should strive to see without needless dis - tortion .

		It is surely wise that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	should be printed in modern style , with modern spelling , except for scholars .

		But in the case of less lofty specimens of literature , quaintness may be an unearned increment , a gracious bestowal of Time , moss , lichens , and ivy upon structures other - wise less appealing .

		In contemporary art we enjoy a sense of fresh contemporaneousness : why not treat ourselves when reading
Boccaccio	PERSON	and Chaucer to a flavor of the remote , the antique , the beautifully quaint ?

		THE '' TWELVE DAYS OF CHEISTMAS '' FOLK-SONG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The `` Bit of Folk Poetry '' in your issue for
January 6	DATE	, page 13 , is well worthy of record ; but your correspondent , Mr.

		I remember the book as a

		It was a gorgeously illustrated quarto - pamphlet , received by me near

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's version differs somewhat from my recollection of the printed verses .

		Each stanza of mine ended with '' Some part of a juniper tree '' -LRB- '' And '' being prefixed in the stanzas following the first -RRB- , instead of `` A beautiful juniper tree . ''

		The '' Twelve bulls a-roaring '' and '' Eleven lords a - leaping '' had a somewhat more graceful substitute in my edition , which I am unable just now to recall .

		It would seem to be a nursery song , from about Shakespeare 's time or before , and some of our English readers may know more of its origin , or whether it came by chance from even earlier French lines .

		In regard to the communication in your issue of
January	DATE	6 concerning the quaint folk-song , '' The Twelve Days of Christmas , '' your readers may be interested to know that one version of this song has been published and is available in two forms . ''

		The Complete Mother Goose , '' published by the
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- pp. 222-4 , includes this in a group of children 's finger games .

		It is also pub - lished with the original musical setting by
Novello	PERSON	.

		The song is a great favorite witli the students of Milwaukee-Downer College , who have sung it at their Christmas Revels for the last six years .

		It is evidently one of the many counting songs used by fond parents of the olden time to relieve the tedium of mechanical memorizing .

		The accumu - lative process of incremental repetition is an old favorite with children , as is seen in '' The House that
Jack Built	PERSON	, '' `` A gaping , wide-mouthed , wad - dling frog , '' and many others .

		This version enumerates the following gifts from `` my true love '' : A partridge in a pear tree , two turtle doves , three French hens , four calling birds -LRB- also written collie birds -RRB- , five gold rings , six geese a-laying , seven swans a-swimming , eight maids a-milking , nine drummers drumming , ten pipers piping , eleven ladies dancing , twelve lords a-leap - ing .

		The order , from nine to twelve , seems to vary .

		Another quaint ` counting game , evidently used by parish priests to fix in the minds of youth certain articles of belief , though combining in grotesque fashion , as was not at all uncommon , secular ideas with the ecclesiastical , is '' The Twelve O 's . ''

		This song comes from
Cornwall	LOCATION	and reads as follows : '' Come and I will sing you ; What will you sing me ?

		I will sing you one O ; What is your one O ?

		One of them is God and Mini and ever will remain so . ''

		Come and I will sing you ; What will you sing me ?

		I will sing you two O ; What is your two O ?

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 109 Two of them are lily-white babes all clothed in green O , One of them is God and Man and ever will remain so . ''

		Eight are the great Archangels , Nine 's the moonshine bright and clear .

		Ten are the ten commandments , Eleven of them are gone to Heaven Twelve are the twelve apostles . ''

		A secular adaptation of this folk-song , local names being substituted for those in the original , was sung to the original tune by the Class of

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the issue of THE DIAL for
January 6	DATE	, atten - tion is called to a bit of folk - poetry , beginning '' On the first day of Christmas '' and going on to the twelfth day in cumulative fashion .

		Your contributor thinks that this poem has never been printed .

		The general form of the ballad , with variations , may be found on page 258 of '' Mother Goose 's Nursery Rhymes '' -LRB-
Fred ' k Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a treasure house of folk-lore jingles and games .

		The items differ somewhat from your version , but that is accounted for by oral tradition , in which considerable freedom was allowed .

		The idea is to make a game for children , to '' do a stunt '' of memory and oral glibness .

		The directions are , '' Each child in succession repeats the gifts of the day and raises her fingers and hands according to the numbers named .

		Forfeits are paid for each mistake . ''

		On page 445 of this same edition of '' Mother Goose '' is another cumulative piece , as follows : '' A kid , a kid my father bought For two pieces of money : A kid , a kid ! ''

		Then came the cat and ate the kid That my father bought For two pieces of money : A kid , a kid ! ''

		And so on , for ten stanzas , with an interpreta - tion based on the Chaldee or the Hebrew version , reviewing the history of the world .

		I recently made a collection of little songs sung by children when jumping rope -LRB- last
spring	DATE	-RRB- , among which was one that I dubbed '' The Endless Chain . ''

		It is not cumulative , but it might go on forever as a '' stunt '' in .

		matching rhymes .

		It reminds one of an '' endless controversy , '' where each one is trying to have the last word ; or it may hark back to ancient '' amo?bic '' verse , a pastoral diversion of shepherds .

		The lines are as follows : '' Mother .

		Mother , guess what I heard !

		Pa 's going to buy me a mocking bird . ''

		If the mocking bird wo n't sing ,
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's going to buy me a diamond ring . ''

		If the diamond ring turns to brass ,
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's going to buy me a looking glass . ''

		If the looking glass gets broke .

		Pa 's going to buy me a
Billy Goat	PERSON	. ''

		If the
Billy Goat	PERSON	runs away ,
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's going to buy me a horse and sleigh . ''

		If the horse and sleigh wo n't go ,
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's going to buy me I do n't know ! ''

		This is recited in very sing-song fashion , while turning rope for jumping .

		The game is to see if the child jumping can jump without missing until the whole story has been recited .

		If she does , the girls who are turning the rope then recite '' Salt , vinegar , mustard , pepper , '' turning faster and faster until the jumper misses .

		I have an interesting collection of these jumping - rope songs .

		They add greatly to the enjoyment of jumping rope , and belong , no doubt , in the depart - ment of folk-lore .

		They have been sung for years , one for thirty years , I judge , having passed down from mother to child .

		Why have they not done away with the capitals at the beginning of the lines of their '' vers libre '' ?

		Is their reluc - tance to do this very consistent thing due to the fact that there is a lurking fear that their poetry may be mistaken for prose ?

		3 THE ` GENIUS OF SARAXAC .

		* So distasteful to Dr.
Trudeau	PERSON	, '' the beloved physician '' of Saranac , was anything like personal fame or popular applause that the wonder is he could ever have been induced to write a book sure to add considerably to such measure of renown as he had hitherto been unable to escape .

		But his friends persuaded him that he owed it to the medical profession , to those afflicted as he himself so long had been , and to the world in general , to tell the story of his life and work ; and doubtless , too , the plan of withholding the book from pub - lication until after the writer 's death helped appreciably to tone down for him the terrors of successful authorship .

		At any rate , we now have from his hand `` An Autobiography , '' characteristically unpretentious in its title , but rich in human interest and almost as remarkable for what the discerning eye reads between the lines as in what those lines them - selves explicitly set forth .

		At the same time there comes from another hand , from a con - genial friend of the autobiographer and in some measure a fellow-sufferer with him , a short but vividly executed sketch of the man , under the title , `` The Beloved Physician . ''

		Mr.
Stephen Chalmers	PERSON	is the author , and what he has so appreciatively written about the founder of Saranac has already won approval in the ``

		He now prefixes Dr.

		degree of dissipation seem to have marked this adolescent period of his life before he at last felt the hereditary prompting to the pursuit of medicine .

		Before that , however , among other abortive undertakings , he had started to train himself for the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, being as he re - lates , `` packed off to a preparatory school at
Newport	LOCATION	, as the
Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	and the old ship Constitution , on which the cadets lived , were then at
Newport	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Chalmers	PERSON	must be in error when he tells us , in this connec - tion , that an elder brother of Edward 's '' had preceded him to
Annapolis	LOCATION	. ''

		It was this elder brother , as both accounts inform us , who preceded the younger in contracting tubercu - losis and in succumbing , far more quickly than in
Edward	LOCATION	's case , to its inroads .

		Beau - tiful in their revelation of character are the words written by the autobiographer about this brother , and touching is the account of the young lad 's devoted nursing of the pa - tient through the three months of his rapid decline to the final death-bed scene .

		Sacri - ficing his own plans and throwing up his appointment as midshipman , the junior brother gave what we now see to have been little short of his very life to ease the other 's sufferings .

		He writes of this early victim to a disease then little understood : '' From childhood he had been delicate , having a congenital heart trouble , and any over-exertion , excitement or fatigue caused his heart 's action to become irregular and his nails and lips to turn blue .

		For this reason , though some years younger than he was , I had always cared for him and helped him and fought his battles with the French boys at school , who took advantage of his lack of strength to torment him .

		He , on the other hand , was a very strong , unselfish and beautiful character , deeply religious , and constantly trying to help me in the straight and narrow path from which I was apt to wander ... '' My brother had a rapidly progressive type of tuberculosis and my time was soon entirely taken up in caring for his needs .

		We had no trained nurses in those days , and I took entire care of him from the time he was taken ill in
September	DATE	until he died on
December 23 , 1865	DATE	.

		We occupied the same room and sometimes the same bed .

		I bathed him and brought his meals to him , and when he felt well enough to go downstairs I carried him up and down on my back , and I tried to amuse and cheer him through the long days of fever and sickness .

		.

		, .

		Not only did the doctor never advise any pre - cautions to protect me against infection , but he told me repeatedly never to open the windows , as it would aggravate the cough ; and I never did , until toward the end my brother was so short of breath that he asked for fresh air . ''

		Such , then , was a significant part of the training of him who was ere long to become the pioneer in an earnest and intelligent
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL in effort to arrest if not overcome tuberculosis by the open-air treatment .

		His medical edu - cation for the work before him , though he knew not then what that work was to be , he secured at the
College of Physicians	ORGANIZATION	and Sur - geons , in
New York	LOCATION	; and after graduation in
1871	DATE	he entered upon the practice of his pro- fession in the same city , with Dr.
Fessenden Otis	PERSON	.

		`` In the same year , '' as Mr.
Chalmers	PERSON	records the facts , `` unconscious that he was doomed to his brother 's disease , he married
Miss Charlotte Beare	PERSON	, of
Douglaston	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, to whom he ever attributed the inspir - ation of his labors through nearly half a century .

		The marriage was a perfect one , although attended by many sorrows .

		Three of their four children died .

		One son sur - vives Dr.
Francis B. Trudeau	PERSON	.

		The death of Dr.
Edward L. Trudeau	PERSON	, Jr. , in
1906	DATE	, was a great blow to his father and a loss to the medical profession . ''

		At the age of twenty-five , after repeated but unheeded warnings ,
Trudeau	PERSON	was amazed and for a moment stunned to hear himself doomed as a well-nigh hopeless case of tuber - culosis .

		How he pulled himself together , went into the Adirondacks against medical advice , repaired to an astonishing extent the ravages of his malady , taught the world from his mountain retreat how best to withstand that dreaded disease , and became the founder of a large open-air colony of health-seekers , is known to some extent , though the founder 's name has , as he desired , escaped the trumpet - ing that would have been so little to his taste .

		Where it has been heard it has been received , for some curious reason , as the name of one who .

		long ago , perhaps in the Stevensonian era , did his work at Saranac and passed to his reward .

		That , on the contrary , he was a very much alive man up to last
November	DATE	, the books now relating his history make suffi - ciently evident .

		The foregoing reference to
Stevenson	PERSON	will serve to introduce him as the most illustrious visitor to Saranac Lake and the valued friend of
Saranac	ORGANIZATION	's presiding genius .

		Dr.
Trudeau	PERSON	writes of him : '' Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	was my patient , but as he was not really ill while here I had comparatively few professional calls to make on him .

		He was so attractive , however , in conversation that I found myself , as it was growing dark , very often seated by the big fireplace in the
Baker	PERSON	cottage having a good talk with my illustrious patient . ''

		As the writer himself admits , there was little in his laboratory researches and profes - sional interests to appeal to the brilliant novelist : but there was a congeniality of tem - perament that made companionship agreeable .

		Mr.
Chalmers	PERSON	concluded from what the doctor told him that '' they agreed on so many of the greater things of life that they had to dis - agree about trivial matters for the sake of something to discuss .

		They actually got into heated argument over the great issue as to which was superior , the American system , * > f transferring baggage , or the British method of handling luggage . ''

		Very characteristic was
Stevenson	PERSON	's emphatic utterance after he had escorted an admiring lady visitor to the door and shut the latter rather forcibly upon her departure : ''
Trudeau	PERSON	, it is not the great unwashed whom I dread ; it is the great washed ! ''

		Of
Trudeau	PERSON	's labors at
Saranac	ORGANIZATION	, chiefly charitable and unremunerative labors , there is room to say but little here .

		Amazing is the amount of work he did in those strenuous years .

		It was enough to break down a strong man .

		and he was an invalid .

		He speaks of his waiting room , his piazza , and even the lawn as being filled with patients on many occasions when he returned home from some occupation elsewhere : and further : '' The waiting room , which one lady always spoke of as my ' menagerie , ' must have impressed others , for on going into the patients ' cottages at the Sani - tarium one day I came across an excellent caricature of myself which a patient , the Reverend Mr.
West	PERSON	- cott , a brother of the author of
David Harum	PERSON	, had drawn .

		I was depicted sitting behind a high picket fence with a double-barreled shot-gun on my lap , waving back an excited crowd who were all shout - ing impossible questions at me about their health , while underneath was written , ' The Penalty of Fame ! '

		The thing struck me as so funny that I begged it of him , and I still have it as a remem - brance of those strenuous office hours . ''

		Much of the wisdom that comes only from hard experience is reflected in Dr.
Trudeau	PERSON	's pages .

		An intimate talk with him must have been something to remember .

		In the words taken down from his mouth by Mr.
Chalmers	PERSON	there is much grim humor `` the grim humor of grit , '' as his friend calls it .

		One day , toward the end , after assuring Mr.
Chalmers	PERSON	that he was '' not going to die right away , '' he added cheerfully , `` No such luck ! ''

		His next remarks are worth quoting . ''

		But what is the scheme of this business of lif e suffering death ?

		I do n't understand .

		It reminds me of the English ' Cat and
Mouse	ORGANIZATION	' bill for suffragists .

		They put a woman in a cell till she 's near dead of starvation .

		Then they let her out for a square meal so she can get strength enough to suffer some more .

		You 've got to have feeling , you know , to suffer .

		There 's a philosophy , by the way , for those who fear the agony of death .

		As you lose the enduring powers of life , you lose also the sensibility to suffering .

		It must be so .

		It is so .

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	I have seen it many times ... Cat and mouse life and death .

PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		INTERPRETATIONS OF H.IT KRATURE .

		* Death has by no means put an end to the publication of writings by
Laf	ORGANIZATION	cadio
Hearn	PERSON	.

		His latest posthumous work , '' Interpretations of Literature , '' comprising some eight hundred pages in two ponderous volumes , is calmly an - nounced by the editor , Professor
John Erskine	PERSON	, to be merely initial .

		Material to the amount of 400,000 or 500,000 words is available : and will no doubt in due time , or undue time , be published in toto .

		This material is in the form of notes taken by students who attended
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's lectures while he held the chair of English literature in the TIniversitv of
Tokyo	LOCATION	-LRB- 1896-1902 -RRB- ; in lecturing , he `` used no notes , but for the convenience of his class , who were listening to a foreign language , he dictated slowly , and certain of his abler stu - dents managed to take down long passages , whole lectures , even a series of lectures , word for word . ''

		As might be expected , the record of the lec - tures unfortunately reveals many traces of their impromptu presentation .

		Inconsisten - cies are common ; exaggerations abound ; commonplace statement of fact -LRB- common - place , that is , to the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	reader -RRB- causes many a page to be pedestrian , if not dull ; occasionally the lecturer blunders upon a term , like `` sheet-lightning , '' which must be laboriously explained to an audience unfamil - | iar with it ; here and there the style is far from typical of
Hearn	LOCATION	, as in this sentence , apparently a definition of Wordsworth : j ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	was a man who composed !

		nearly all of his shorter poems standing up . ''

		In brief , these lectures are decidedly ragged , and would have been a dismal nightmare to
Hearn	PERSON	if he , with his love of finish , had had an opportunity to see them .

		When advised to print his lectures , he responded that they were too lacking in form : `` Were I to re - INTERPRETATIONS OF LITERATI/HE .

		By
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		write each of them ten or fifteen times , I might print them .

		But that would not be worth while . ''

		Hearn then goes on to dis - parage himself in terms as exaggerated as those in Professor
Erskine	PERSON	's praise of him : '' I am not a scholar , nor a competent critic of the best ; there are scores of men able to do the same thing incomparably better ... I have not the scholarship needed for the develop - ment and exercise of the critical faculty , in the proper sense of the term . ''

		On the other hand .

		Professor
Erskine	PERSON	is bold enough to assert of these lectures : '' In substance if not in form they are criticism of the finest kind , unmatched in English unless we return to the best of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, and in some ways un - equalled by anything in
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		Both of these wholesale utterances surely need radical modification ; the truth lies , as one might expect , in that golden mean which
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	decried .

		So far as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's estimate of himself is concerned , it is clear that he under - rated his scholarship , and overrated in gen - eral the need of wide scholarship in the kind of writing congenial to him .

		As for Professor
Erskine	PERSON	's estimate , it is difficult to see , from these '' initial '' eight hundred pages , how
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's reputation as a critic is in any respect to be eclipsed by
Hearn 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		To some extent , this disagreement between
Hearn	PERSON	and his editor is apparently due to a difference in the use of the term '' criticism . ''

		When
Hearn	PERSON	speaks of '' the critical faculty , in the proper sense of the term , '' he perhaps thinks of criti - cism primarily as judgment certainly that / x `` the proper sense of the term . ''

		However responsive in sensibility ,
Hearn	PERSON	very likely felt that he did not know enough to be a good judge of literature .

		But to Professor
Erskine	PERSON	.

		criticism apparently is an account of '' the effect of the writing upon the reader '' ; it is a '' showing you what is waiting there to be seen '' ; it is , in a word , not judgment , but interpretation .

		This brings us to the central quarrel among the critics of literature should the first aim of the critic be to interpret or to judge ?

		a quarrel by no means in a way to be settled soon , or to be renewed at length here .

		It will suffice , in this connection , to point out that as a judge of literature
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	is by no means distinguished .

		Aside from not very remarkable specific assertions , such as his designation of
Stevenson	PERSON	as '' one of the finest masters of style in all English lit - erature , '' or his conclusion that , in compari - son with
Tennyson	PERSON	, Arnold was '' not a great thinker or a profound poet , '' or his astonish - ing dictum that the poetry of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	is
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 '' such poetry that there is nothing greater in English past or present , and can scarcely be anything greater in the English of the future '' -LRB- are the transcribers of
Ream	ORGANIZATION	's lec - tures perchance at fault here ? -RRB-

		, an entire lecture like the one '' On Romantic and
Clas	PERSON	- sic Literature , in Relation to Style '' is a clear indication of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's all but complete lack of the poise and disinterestedness of the mind that judges ably .

		This is how he seeks `` to define the romantic position '' : 4 < It is right and artistic to choose whatever form of lit - erary expression an author may prefer , pro- vided only that the form be beautiful and correct . ''

		We need not make much of the odd implication that what is beautiful is artistic : but what of the word correct ?

		What decides whether the form be correct ?

		Is not that a tacit confession of the need of a standard other than the one proposed in the definition itself ?

		He proceeds to contrast with this meaningless definition a definition of classi - cism that does violence to pseudo-classicism even , which , indeed , and not classicism , he is trying to define : '' You have no right whatever to choose your own forms of literary expression , either in poetry or in prose .

		Experience has proved that the forms which we prescribe are the best , and whatever you have to say must be said according to our rules .

		If you do not obey those rules , you will be inflict - ing an injury upon your native language and your native literature ; and for such an injury you can - not be forgiven . ''

		Elsewhere , in a lecture on Keats , he de - scribed the genuine classic style : '' Well , in the mind of the old Greeks , who saw great truths perfectly , the beauty of utterance consisted in expressing the largest truth in the most direct and frank way , and in language that a child could understand . ''

		Toward the end of the lecture on the two schools , the critic , with unconscious legerde - main , reaches some curious conclusions .

		He is attempting the futile task of proving the superiority of the Romantic school by show - ing how abundant great Romantic literature is . ''

		Out of all the glorious names on the roll of European -LSB- as contrasted with
Orien	PERSON	- tal -RSB- literature you will find that the vast majority are names of romanticists . ''

		He does not name them , but says he '' might cite fifty names by way of illustration / ' Fifty would be wearisome , but let us name for him a few -LRB- the very greatest -RRB- of these redun - dantly numerous '' romanticists '' : in
Greece	LOCATION	, Homer and
Sophocles	LOCATION	; in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Virgil .

		Hor - ace , and Dante : in
France	LOCATION	,
Racine	LOCATION	and Mo - liere ; in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Goethe : in
England	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare and
Milton	PERSON	.

		This fine showing is to be explained by the fact that the Classic school , championing impersonality , is moving in the wrong direction , , while the Romantic school , championing personality , naturally achieves genius -LRB- for '' Personality , in its high - est forms , signifies Genius '' -RRB- .

		Hearn goes on to illustrate the superiority of Romanticism by remarking that in nineteenth century En - glish literature there is not a single Classic writer of importance : significant , surely , in a Romantic century , when even Romanticism did not produce a poet of the first rank !

		Distinction as a judge of literature is surely not to be attained by a mind that moves in these mysterious ways .

		But another distinction
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	as surely had , he was an illuminating teacher .

		He showed infinite skill in presenting Western thought and emotion to an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	audience , a skill that might be illustrated at length .

		It is another and more essential skill , however , that justifies the publication of these volumes , the presentation of literary thought and emotion in such a manner that the meaning of the text , or the coherence of the poet 's life , is revealed to the reader far more clearly than before .

		The title of the work is appro - priate - , these lectures are truly interpreta - tions of literature .

		Professor
Erskine	PERSON	rightly characterizes
Hearn	PERSON	's ideal of the teaching of literature as '' rare and beautiful '' : that ideal being , in
Hearn	LOCATION	's words , to teach literature '' as the expression of emotion and sentiment .

		as the representation of life .

		In consider - ing a poet I tried to explain the quality and the powers of the emotion he produces . ''

		Al - though the intellectual point of view is un - happily slighted in this ideal , it is surely a '' rare and beautiful '' ideal in comparison with that which still dominates in the histori - cal , scientific , Germanized departments of literature in the American university ; though the present world earthquake is already caus - ing signs of a change in the minds and bosoms of Productive Scholarship .

		The fol - lowing , from a '' Note on the Study of Shake - speare , '' though not without
Hearn	PERSON	's romantio twist , is salutary advice for the secondary - school teachers of our day .

		even for university teachers : '' The study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		must be based upon imagination .

		I mean that the best way to study a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is to try to under - stand perfectly , not the language , which is often a matter of very secondary ' importance , but the situ - ations ... To approach
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the student ought first to get rid of the idea he is about to study a monument of language ... The style and the language of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are the least impor - tant part of his creations , while in the other poets 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	they form , the most important part ... And so it were better that in reading Shakespeare you should begin by paying least attention to the language and most attention to the action or , to be more explicit , the living incident of the plays . ''

		`` Imagination , '' `` the living incident of the plays , '' these are , as every teacher knows in his heart , central in the study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and many another poet , and not Sources , Elizabethan English , the Elizabethan Stage ,
Elizabethan London	LOCATION	,
Elizabethan Manners	ORGANIZATION	, and all the other backgrounds and fore - grounds and sidegrounds that distract atten - tion from the centre .

		The foregoing discussion hardly suggests the range of subjects embraced in these lec - tures .

		The first volume is mainly a nine - teenth century selection , containing lectures on
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Hood	LOCATION	,
Carlyle , Writers of Prose Fic	ORGANIZATION	- tion ,
Meredith	PERSON	, etc. , -LRB- with a separate index for the volume -RRB- .

		Volume II is a miscella - neous collection , the
Bible	LOCATION	, Ballads ,
Berke	PERSON	- ley ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, the
Havamal	LOCATION	, Poems about Insects , etc. .

		A single illustration of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's mode of treatment in discussing a particular poem must serve .

		In the lecture on Words - worth , after a few words on flowers in En - glish poetry , '' The Daffodils '' is printed entire ; then comes this passage , in which the meaning is surely brought home to a mind previously unresponsive : '' The daffodil is a bright yellow flower , and a bed of daffodils in blossom really produces such a blaze of color as would remind a Japanese traveller of the blossoming of the Natane in some parts of this country .

		The effect described by the poet must have been greatly enhanced by the proximity of the dancing lake-water beyond the flowers , bright blue under the sun .

		You know what a fine contrast is made by the meeting of blue and yel - low .

		This is a bit of painting from the English lakes .

		But the point of the poem , written nearly one hundred years ago , is not in the description ; it comes , like a surprise , with the last stanza .

		Have you ever noticed what the effect of certain bright scenes may be upon your own senses ?

		It is at night particularly that the phenomenon may be studied .

		You blow out the lamp and lie down to sleep , and close your eyes ; then , all at once , in the dark you see in bright sunshine some incident that impressed you during the day .

		Perhaps it is a street , with people passing by , and children play - ing ; and perhaps it is the face of a friend with whom you have been talking .

		Or it is a scene of travelling , a stretch of sea beach , with waves breaking silently .

		This may come to you again and again come to you also in dreams , and you will never entirely forget it .

		I am told that old persons see these after-images more clearly than young persons ; but everybody sees them at times .

		This is more than what is commonly called imagi - nation or memory ; perhaps we might call it per - fected visual memory .

		It may be pleasant or unpleasant .

		But if the experience thus recalled be of a happy and beautiful kind , a visual memory is accompanied by the revival of the same happy feeling . ''

		It is so in the poet 's case .

		He felt more than common pleasure in the sight of the yellow flowers swaying in the
summer	DATE	breeze beside the sunlit water ; and afterwards , whenever the picture re - turned to his memory , he felt the joy of the moment again the happiness of the season , and of the sunlight and of the bright air , all of which seem to him expressed by the l dancing ' of the yellow flowers .

		One expression in the last stanza I hope you will remember , as it is now very famous ' that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude . '

		Of course the poet means , by ' inward eye , ' the faculty of imagination ; and imagination indeed makes the pleasure of solitude that is , enables its possessor to be happy in spite of being a one '

		`` PASSAGE TO MORE THAN
INDIA	LOCATION	. ''

		* When a book on anything concerned with
India	LOCATION	is described on the title-page as `` a traveller 's record , '' a reviewer is likely to be distrustful .

		But he must remember that there are travellers and travellers ; and in the case of Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	's ''
India	LOCATION	and Its Faiths . ''

		he must finally adjudge the words both modest and significant .

		One of the delights of faring about the `` multanimous peninsula '' is the willingness of the native and the resident alien to talk helpfully , if you are genuinely and intelligently interested ; but not less striking is their capacity for turning the cold - est of cold shoulders , if you are just '' globe - trottingly '' and superficially inquisitive .

		Fortunately for himself and his readers , Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	belonged to the former type of ques - tioner , being most generously equipped before he landed ; and he evidently utilized every moment of a rich and active visit to correct his impressions and broaden his knowledge .

		His training in the problems of psychology and religion -LRB- he is professor of philosophy in
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- made an admirable propae - deutic for his investigations in
India	LOCATION	; and he has given us a thoughtful book , that is schol - arly with no tinge of pedantry , and is un - marred by the intolerance of the old-time missionary zealot on the one hand , or the love - blinded enthusiasm of such thoroughgoing converts as Sister Nivedita on the other .

		He still believes in the superiority of Christianity as a working religion , and in the West as opening more useful doors on the future ; but *
INDIA	LOCATION	AND ITS FAITHS .

		By
James Bissett Pratt	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hougrhton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 115 he believes this only in spirit of one who has seen
India	LOCATION	and its people with wise and kindly eyes : '' It is hard for me to conceive how one can stay anytime among them without finding them truly lovable and without imbibing a genuine respect for the simple dignity of their lives , the quiet courtesy of their manners , their uncomplaining endurance of hardships , their unbounded hospitality , and the feeling for spiritual values , which , in spite of gross superstition , is unmistakable in the Indian atmos - phere . ''

		For the monotheistic or agnostic
Occiden	PERSON	- tal , the easiest approach to a study of Indian religions would seem to lie through
Moham	PERSON	- medanism .

		Of course the followers of the prophet number only some sixty-seven mil - lions , about a fifth of the population ; but their faith is fairly familiar to us all , and at the same time it has been so influenced by its sojourn in
India	LOCATION	as to offer a tiny bit of help in making the transition to
Hinduism	LOCATION	.

		One feature of Mohammedanism that is always interesting , the problem of predestina - tion , receives its full share of attention from our author .

		He reports that both the learned theologian and the ordinary tradesman in - sisted stoutly on their belief in the freedom of the will , and he adduces the following conversation as typical : '' Question . '

		Does everything happen in ac - cordance with God 's will , so that nothing is done anywhere in the universe which He does not decree ? '

		`` Answer .

		` Yes , everything that happens and everything that is done by man or by anyone else is in accord with God 's will . ' ''

		Q. ' When a man sins , then , it is God that makes him sin ? ' ''

		A. ' - Oh , no , not at all .

		God never wills sin . ' ''

		Q. ' How do you reconcile this with your for - mer statement ? '

		`` A. ` You see , man 's power to sin , as man 's power for all his actions , comes from God .

		But man 's choice of sin is his own and is against the will of God .

		God is displeased at sin . ' ''

		Q. ' Then man 's will is free ? ' ''

		A. ' Oh , yes . ' ''

		Q. ' Then some things do happen that are not in accordance with God 's will ? '

		`` A. ` Yes . ' ''

		But it must be remembered that a discussion of God 's possible responsibility for sin trenches on very delicate and difficult ground ; and we respectfully believe that the Indian Moslem is much more of a fatalist than such a conversation might imply .

		When a Moham - medan trader concludes his bartering with you by making the simple dignified asser - tion , `` If it is destined that I sell you the wares , I shall sell you the wares , '' he is speaking much more naturally and signifi - cantly than when he has been deliberately engaged in a discussion of predestination as connected with God 's responsibility for sin ; and we believe that Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	's conclusion as to the popular belief in free will would have been modified by a wider and less formal | investigation .

		As an example of the changes effected in | Mohammedanism by its alien surroundings , I we may mention the greater tolerance of the Indian Moslemite , as compared with his Arab or Turkish co-religionist .

		This differ - ence is very marked ; and Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	was naturally astonished when he was asked not only to attend the
Friday	DATE	service at
Benares	LOCATION	and kneel with the faithful during prayers , but also to make an address in the mosque at the conclusion of the ceremonies .

		But the influence we have in mind is seen in its extreme form in the coloring of popular Mohammedanism by
Hinduism	LOCATION	in very many districts .

		This coloring is touched upon by Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	in passing ; but it is deeply signifi - cant for historian and philosopher alike , and deserves more extended notice .

		It is impos - | sible to give exact figures ; but one might almost talk of millions of Indian Moslems who are to be distinguished from Hindus for the most part in name only .

		They join their Hindu fellows cheerfully in all sorts of relig - ious festivals , share piously their idolatrous rites , and feel much more at home with the kindly
Ganesh	PERSON	than with the solitary and distant Allah .

		Hinduism is incredibly ab - sorbent on its native ground .

		When the honest student passes from Mohammedanism to
Hinduism	LOCATION	, he passes from the difficult to the desperate .

		Let any intelligent inquirer converse with a venerable pundit about the realization of the self in divine love , and go next morning to the reek - ing sacrificial services at the Kalighat shrine .

		Let him read the transcendent teachings of j
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, and then turn to such a book as
Thurston	PERSON	's '' Omens and
Supersti	PERSON	- tions of
Southern India	LOCATION	, '' or to some of the unblinking pages in the invaluable `` Hindu Manners , Customs , and Ceremonies '' of the Abbe
Dubois	PERSON	.

		Let him ponder the higher aspects of the doctrine of transmigration , and then consider the more repugnant and terrible features of child marriage .

		All glib conclusions and ambitious formulae seem strangely pitiable .

		Nor does our author dis - guise the difficulty .

		Throughout six rather long chapters he does all one can to give an impartial treatment of the subjects indi - cated or implied by such captions as '' Hindu Worship , '' `` The Many Gods , '' `` The One God , '' `` Duty and Destiny , '' `` The Hindu 116 THE DIAL
Feb. 3	DATE	Dharma , '' and '' Teachers , Priests , and Holy Men . ''

		And on the whole his achievement is distinctly praiseworthy , the chapters be - ing replete with sound information and sane judgments .

		Naturally , there is no single clue to this colossal labyrinth ; but Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	comes as near to giving one as is possible by dwelling on the Hindu belief in the soul . ''

		Hindus are sure of the soul .

		There is nothing else they are so sure of . ''

		`` Underneath all the strange noises of
Hinduism	LOCATION	, like the distant murmur of the sea , there sounds ever the far - off music of the soul . ''

		And it is some con - cern about this great practical reality , the soul , that connects
Shankara	ORGANIZATION	's Brahman , the spiritual unity back of all phenomena , with the thirty-three million gods , or godlings , of the official figures .

		The average Hindu be - lieves very simply that there are many gods .

		Very many Hindus would say there are many gods but there is also one God , without feel - ing any necessity to reconcile his statements .

		Not a few would say the same thing , and offer a reconciliation , convincing or not ; and some would say there is only one God .

		And within these countless millions you would have every range of attitude from the most degrading devil worship to the most exalted spiritual monotheism , every sort of conduct from the grossest animal indulgence to the most self - immolating asceticism ; and every individual considered might rightly lay un - hesitating claim to the name of Hindu .

		It is easy to write that the life of the Hindu is essentially a religious life , not merely a life that is superstitious or filled with pious per - formances , but , more than that , a life lived in unfailing realization of relations that bind human life to a supernatural world .

		But when you have said this , you have still an infinity of gradations to take into account , and you must not rest in the deceptive com - fort of an alluring definition .

		The fact is simply that
Hinduism	LOCATION	refuses to be generalized .

		It must be taken step by step , point by point , and , save in the highest spheres , one is often confronted with the fact that what seemed a religious philosophy turns j out to be an unreasoning system of caste , j And therewith one is launched again on a \ vast and treacherous ocean .

		Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	writes j optimistically : '' Nearly everyone who knows anything at all about
India	LOCATION	knows about caste , so little need be said of it here . ''

		But the people who know caste are rare indeed , although you encounter it at every turn in
Hindu	LOCATION	life and religion .

		However , we may i not follow this tempting theme any further , j and must merely repeat the old warning , ! ''

		Whoso seeketh a work on
Hinduism	LOCATION	that sat - isfieth , seeketh forever in vain ; yet whoso once beginneth the search will never be satisfied uutil he hath found such an one . ''

		In the meantime Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	's volume offers a sane , useful , and stimulating treatment of the more salient features .

		Over the remaining chapters we must pass without discussion .

		They bear such headings as '' Reform Movements within
Hinduism	LOCATION	, '' `` The
Kabir Panthis	PERSON	and the Sikhs , '' `` The Parsees , '' '' Christian Missions in
India	LOCATION	, '' '' Education and Reform . ''

		It is particularly hard to refrain from a word or two about Buddhism , and about the possible lessons for
America	LOCATION	in Indian religion and philosophy .

		To us the chapter on '' What the West Might Learn '' does not correspond to the expecta - tions aroused in turning to it after the other sections of the book ; but fortunately it is a subject on which each reader will be prepared to form his own conclusions .

		Inasmuch as we have commended the book so warmly , even if we have ventured to differ about some not unimportant points , we shall not be misunderstood if we voice a protest on a few details .

		For instance , there is an occa - sional infelicitous flippancy , as in the quota - tion from a friend who spoke of the goddess
Kali	PERSON	as `` a kind of militant suffragette . ''

		Such a statement merely distracts the mind and befogs the discussion .

		Again , a man who wantonly shoots ducks that can not possibly be retrieved is not '' surely a very typical prod - uct of our Western culture with its love of self-assertion and its cult of sport . ''

		There is hot a good sportsman in
England	LOCATION	or Amer - ica who would not brand such wanton slaugh - ter as the work of a cad .

		Furthermore , it seems to us that Dr.
Pratt	PERSON	is generally just a little hard on the Britisher in
India	LOCATION	; but that is a large subject .

		Indian life is not all meta - physics and hospitality .

		As a criticism of a different type , one may regret that the author did not include a brief account of several of the primitive religions so richly represented among the less civilized outlying tribes .

		Of course these represent a rather remote part of the field for the general reader ; but they are interesting and surprisingly instructive .

		The book is well printed , contains twenty - four good illustrations , and is appropriately bound .

		On page 57 mention is made of a picture of Krishna on the cover ; but the actual cover shows the delightful lines of the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a second edition , which we hope will be demanded very soon , a few statis - tical tables might well be inserted before the helpful index .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 117 INTELLIGENCE AS A MORAL OBLIGATION .

		* Seldom does it fall to the lot of a reviewer to open a book upon which he finds it impossi - ble to bestow anything but unqualified praise , and such a rare experience tends to paralyze that critical faculty the exercise of which he has accustomed himself to regard as his dis - tinctive privilege .

		It is therefore not without a sense of strangeness that we frankly aban - don the customary attitude of criticism , and adopt that of grateful acceptance , inviting all who enjoy good things to share with us the pleasure and profit to be derived from the reading of '' The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent . ''

		by Dr.
John Erskine	PERSON	of
Colum	PERSON	-
bia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book takes its name from the first of the four essays of which it is composed , the other three bearing the titles . ''

		The Call to
Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The Mind of Shakespere . ''

		and '' Wonder and
Magic	ORGANIZATION	in Literature . ''

		Many readers of '' The Hibbert Journal '' will recall with pleasure the appearance in its pages , about two years ago , of the titular essay re - ferred to .

		Its timeliness and its appropriate - ness to the needs of an age that is conspicuous for its lack of forethought and its empiri - cal habit of '' muddling through , '' must have struck many of its readers at that time .

		Its , excellent literary quality , too , was such as we do not expect and do not frequently find in magazine articles , and it is therefore with peculiar pleasure that we welcome its re - publication in book form , and the more so that it is re-enforced by three other papers of fqual quality .

		A volume of '' collected essays '' can not usu - ally be regarded homogeneously , or thought of otherwise than as what it is , an assemblage for convenience in publication of separate literary efforts .

		In these four articles , how - ever , a distinct thread of connection is to be discovered , a unity of aim and purpose , a similarity of direction and a kinship of spirit which it is hard to describe .

		The connecting thread is the author 's conviction indicated in the title of the book that the duty lies upon men not only to acquire that culture which consists in a refinement of the emotions , but ta bring the power of the understanding to bear upon all the problems of life .

		We shall prob - ably be reminded that what we chiefly suffer from in these days is over-intellectualism , and that the present reaction in speculative think - ing toward intuitionalism and pragmatism is the inevitable consequence of having laid undue emphasis on the idea of mastering the * THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO BE INTELLIGENT .

John	PERSON	problems of ontology by the aid of the under - standing .

		It may be true that in the region of pure speculation the instrument of reason has been used for a purpose to which - it is unsuited , and that the effort to transcend the finite and comprehend the infinite by means of the intelligence alone is but another of those fruitless attempts to answer the old question stated by Job in the words .

		`` Who shall find out the Almighty to perfection ?

		It is higher than
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, deeper than Hell , what canst thou know ? ''

		But to recognize the limits beyond which the intellect , when it leaves the atmosphere of human experience , must attempt to soar in a vacuum , is not to deny it its rightful uses within these limits .

		It is as a necessary part of our equipment for the art of practical living that Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	lodges his claim for a deeper recognition of intelligence as among the cardinal virtues .

		It is undoubtedly true that our poets and writers of fiction , and those teachers and preachers on whom we have relied for guidance in the conduct of life , have not suffi - ciently emphasized the need for an intelli - gent apprehension of the causal relations of things .

		We have been warned by
Solomon	PERSON	that '' Out of the heart are the issues of life , '' by
Tennyson	PERSON	that '' Knowledge must know her place , she is the second not the first . ''

		by
Browning	PERSON	that `` All else but what man feels is but the froth o ' the liquor that o'er-brims the cup and runs to waste adown its side . ''

		by
Burns	PERSON	that '' the heart 's aye the part aye that maks us richt or wrang . ''

		It has been so hammered into our consciousness that to be good is better than to be clever , that the divine gift ^ of reason has to some extent fallen into disrespect .

		But here we must feel our way carefully .

		The universal conviction of the best of men that the Tightness of the heart and the possession of those virtues that ` right - heartedness implies are of primary impor - tance , must not be lightly put aside .

		A man may be full of errors of the head , his knowl - edge may be of the most limited description , and his reasoning powers those of a child : yet if his heart is sound , his instincts pure , and his affections deep , we unhesitatingly -LRB- and we believe rightly -RRB- place him among the masters in the difficult art of living .

		To retain this conviction that character comes before intelligence , and yet to recognize the obligation that , the possession of character imposes upon its possessor to develop his in - telligence to the highest degree , this is the moral contained in the first essay of Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	's book . ''

		He that sinneth against his understanding wrongeth his own soul . ''

		118 THE DIAL -LSB- Feb. 3
Emmanuel Swedenborg	PERSON	, in his interpreta - tion of the doctrine of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	in terms of human psychology , affirms that Love , Feel - ing , or Emotion represents the primary force of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	, the ESSE of Being ; but that only when that Esse was incarnated in the form of Truth , Wisdom , or Intelligence , and became the EXISTERE of Being , could there have been generated an effluent force -LRB- the Holy Ghost -RRB- equal to the task of raising life from its low estate to that high one which `` doth not yet appear '' but toward which we believe we are moving .

		This interpretation , it will be observed , gives Love the primary place among our conceptions of spiritual origins , but imposes upon Love the necessity of embodying or objectifying itself in Truth or Wisdom , the Word had to be made flesh and to dwell among men .

		In this way we would interpret Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	's warning .

		We are not merely to rest in the consciousness that the Eternal arms are around us , that we are being carried on a stream of tendency toward righteousness , that we are doomed to perfection by an irresistible evolutionary law ; but we must consciously become part - ners in the redemptive process , we must not only add to our faith virtue but to our virtue knowledge , we must acquire skill in the use of that instrument by which alone virtue can effectively express itself , Intelligence .

		We forfeit the right to justify our errors by the reflection that we have walked humbly ac - cording to our lights , if we have failed to inquire whether the light that is in us is not darkness .

		To `` trust in God and do the right '' is a useful working principle only if we have intelligently endeavored to discover what the '' right '' is .

		But Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	's charge against the old Anglo-Saxon way of viewing life is not merely the negative one of failing to realize the importance of intelligence , or to give it its place as among the cardinal virtues .

		He charges us , and not without reason , with hav - ing regarded the intellect with suspicion as a peril and a snare ; with having assumed that j a choice must be made between goodness and j intelligence ; `` that stupidity is first cousin to moral conduct and cleverness the first step to mischief . ''

		It is not difficult to find proof of the justice of this charge in the constant dissociation of goodness and understanding that is reflected in our literature and social standards .

		Mephistopheles is invariably rep - resented as the embodiment of pure intellect , j while the biographies of saints and philan - thropists are for the most part pictures of glowing souls radiating heat without light , feeling without understanding , emotion with - out intelligence .

		This over-emphasis upon character as against intelligence shows itself especially in our fruitless attempts to solve social problems by mere force of good will , - problems in economics , for example , in which -LRB- human welfare being the end aimed at -RRB- it is assumed that kindly feeling and noble enthu - siasm are the only instruments necessary for the solution .

		An attitude of kindly contempt expressing itself in such words as '' doctri - naire '' or `` theorist '' is maintained toward those who approach such problems from the side of the intellect , whose aim it is to attain to an understanding of fundamental things , and to deal with causes rather than symp - toms .

		And it is strange , indeed , that to a prob - lem in engineering we bring all the knowledge of scientific principles that intelligence can discover ; to produce commodities cheaply we develop our inventive and creative powers to the highest degree ; but that in attempting to solve the great problem of human living - together in relations of justice and equity , we forget that here , too , active intelligence is the virtue which gives whatever value they possess to all those other virtues that have moved us to action .

		In Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	's Commencement address entitled '' The Call to
Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' the same de - mand is made upon the student beginning his life 's career , to break away from the cus - tomary attitude which eager young minds so readily adopt in conceiving of the places they are called upon to fill in the economy of things , and to bring the whole force of the intelligence to bear upon the ultimate pur - pose for which he has been trained .

		Here , again , the appeal for a broader and more comprehensive conception of the ultimate goal toward which human culture strives , or should be striving , implies a draft upon the higher intelligence .

		It is only too easily assumed that those who serve and those who are to be served constitute two separate classes whom God hath put asunder and whom man may not join without disrespect to the Divine Purpose .

		The attitude of mind in which those stand who are called to serve the world as preachers , scientists , or teachers , toward the great mass of somewhat unwilling recipients of those services , is of the most vital importance .

		If that attitude is wrong , as it is so likely to be , it can only be made right by an active use of the intelligence , by rising above personal enthusiasms and ambitions , however noble , and obtaining a glimpse of the ultimate end toward which the whole creation moves , as seen by a God who is no respecter of persons , but who loves the
1916	DATE	-RSB- humblest day-drudge equally with the most gifted savant .

		The questions which Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	addresses to his students are most well-timed , and we | indulge the hope that in the attempt to find answers to them many of our young men may have had their reflective faculties aroused , and been compelled to take such new sound - ings and bearings as may change perma - nently the course they are to steer in the voyage to which every commencement address is a cheering send-off .

		It can do our future snides and philosophers nothing but good if they are impelled to such heart-searching as must be stimulated by the questions , '' Do you hope to cure your neighbour 's misfortune or merely to live by it ? '' ''

		Do you look on the unfortunate as your brothers in temporary distress , or do you see in them objects of char - ity ? '' ''

		Do you think your function is to serve and their function to be served ; and if by a miracle they should get on their feet , would you have lost your career ? ''

		Nor is the author less definite in his arraignment of the professors of Science and Teaching , or of those who propose to serve by making them - selves the repositories of learning and wis - dom .

		Not only , he indicates , should the ultimate purpose of a priesthood be to make a nation of priests , and to prepare the way for a condition in which a priesthood will be unnecessary , but this should be the conscious aim of all who serve , in whatever capacity .

		So long as the gulf separating the servers from the served - is conceived of as being or - ganic and in the nature of things , the service can never be of spiritual benefit to either giver or receiver .

		After warning his theologi - cal students of the delusion that `` a system of superiorities and inferiorities is vital to the religious life , '' or even that a certain superiority of consecration attaches to the office of priest , he addresses himself in sim - ilar words to his scientific students .

		`` You , '' he says , `` can no more be scientific for your neighbors than you can be holy for them .

		Scientists are as eager to do our thinking for us as ever the Church has been ; they are just as ready to use force to make effective the truth as they see it , and they keep the scien - tific spirit to themselves as effectively as the priests keep their priesthood . ''

		The third essay .

		`` The Mind of Shake - spere , '' is peculiarly refreshing to one who has just read Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's excellent re - view -LRB- in THE DIAL of
Dec. 9	DATE	-RRB- of Mr.
J. P. Baxter	PERSON	's book on the time-worn Bacon-Shake - speare controversy .

		From the account which the reviewer gives of the author 's tortuous attempts to deal with the apparent incon - gruity between the Shakespearean plays and the character and circumstances of their re - puted creator , it is a pleasure to turn to Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	's essay , where the strange phenome - non which the mind of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	presents to the psychologist is discussed in a manner which does no violence to our sense of proba - bility and accords with what we know of the constitution of the human mind . ''

		Can we not imagine . ''

		he asks , '' a grown person with whom for the most part expression has re - mained an instantaneous reflex of experience , who sees true habitually as we less child-like folk do occasionally , and who speaks so spon - taneously that he takes no account of his utterances ? ''

		Here is suggested the idea of a sort of short-circuiting of the current which connects perception and expression , in which consciousness and intention are left out .

		`` The clearness of vision and the immediate - ness and accuracy of expression . ''

		which are so conspicuous in the best of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work , are certainly more explicable on this theory of direct connection between the per - ceptive and the expressive faculties , than where the surface-consciousness , as with ordi - nary mortals , must take a hand in the transac - tion .

		If this theory seems to make of the poet an unconscious automaton , Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	accepts the risk of that conclusion with a bold - ness which we admire .

		In the fourth and last essay , Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	reminds us that we have not yet so completely escaped from the dominion of superstition , and the child-like belief in magic and won - der , as we like to persuade ourselves .

		We have told ourselves so frequently that we now live in a world of cause and effect , and that the spirits with whom our fathers lived on terms of familiarity have been finally ban - ished from the earth , that we firmly believe it .

		In spite of this , we exhibit the remains of our old faith in magic and miracle in many ways .

		`` We have as yet gained far less con - trol of experience than our intellectual self - respect demands .

		We still blunder through life as though we did not know that the great game must be played according to rules . ''

		We still believe , Micawber-like .

		in things '' turning up . ''

		We have not made the prog - ress in the scientific habit of mind that the passing of the years and the amassing of experience ought to have produced .

		We still love to think that miracles happen , that un - caused good-luck befalls the virtuous though incompetent person , and the literary fiction that reflects the persistence of this primitive superstition still attracts us .

		And the diffi - culty is .

		as Dr.
Erskine	PERSON	points out , that we can not , and should not if we could , entirely 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	banish this ancient habit of mind .

		`` If we love the poetry of life , there is a sense in which we can not get along without miracles ; without them as a language to talk with we can not express that profound wonder at com - mon facts which is the sign of enlightened manhood . ''

		The difficulty with most of us is to preserve this love of the miraculous , wedded as it is to that faculty of wonder which keeps the imagination alive , and yet to detect the thimble-rigging by which some of our writers would delude us into the belief that the laws of consequence are occasionally out of action .

		The danger of falling under this delusion is finely indicated in the follow - ing passage : '' We are convinced that to be a professional crook will lead to moral deterioration , but we read with pleasure these fables which keep the soul of the crook unspotted from his own conduct .

		Our pleasure is based on a fine humaneness , on the undoubted fact that criminals are largely manu - factured , and that few of them are originally bad at heart .

		But thjs doctrine , excellent as a vantage - point from which to enter upon some social respon - sibility and rescue , has been stretched in our fiction until it misrepresents the consequences of wrong - doing , and even diminishes strangely enough that sense of social responsibility from which it sprang .

		We felt to blame for letting our fellow-man become a criminal , but after the story or the play has demonstrated how excellently moral the crim - inal is , we feel less guilty . ''

		Here , again , the moral contained in the title of this book returns to us , and we realize the imperative need for the constant watchful play of the intelligence upon all our mental and emotional processes .

		In the words quoted from
Emerson	PERSON	, '' The beginning of power is in the belief that things go not by luck but v

		COSMIC ; SYSTEMS AND PHILOSOPHICAL IMAGINATION .

		* Philosophy , I have had occasion more than once to point out , maintains , in its great tradi - tion , an essentially compensatory character .

		The world is not one which was made for us .

		That slow reconstruction of it in fact , which we call civilization , is too slow and too inade - quate to satisfy the impatient mind .

		Imagi - nation does not wait upon fact , but leaps beyond it to the heart 's desire .

		Such leaping beyond has been predominantly the part of philosophy in its great tradition .

		Against the fact of death it has sought to demonstrate desired immortality ; against the fact of * THE CONCEPT OF CONSCIOUSNESS .

		change , the pleasant eternity ; against the restless multiplicity and diversity of the daily life , the reposeful unity of the metaphysical unseen .

		That which it has opposed to expe - rience it has called real ; and the substance of experience itself , because it was so fraught with evil and danger , it has called unreal and relegated to the realm of appearance .

		The skill with which it has done this , the subtlety with which it has met the difficulties which fact always puts in the way of dialectic , have made it a high and precious exercise of the creative imagination .

		Now of all passions which animate the philosophical mind , perhaps the strongest is j the logical passion , the passion for unity and consistency .

		Thought may surrender , one after another , all the cherished compensatory excel - lences with which the imagination endows the world .

		It may surrender the immortality of the soul , the spirituality and eternity of the world , the freedom of the will , but it will still cling to cosmic unity and logical consistency .

		This desideratum becomes the principle of reconstruction in all sorts of systems , mate - rialisms and idealisms and empiricisms , the one sole salvage from the wrecks of disillusion _ The use of it escapes monotony chiefly by force of the materials to which it is applied , and the organization of them by which it is generated .

		One such very interesting con - struction which abandons all desiderata but this is Neo-Realism .

		On this side of the water the most interest - ing protagonist of this new philosophic fash - ion is Mr.
Edwin Holt	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		His philosophy is in most respects a philoso - phy of disillusion .

		In one respect , however , that of unity , it is a masterpiece of imagina - tive construction .

		The world as Mr.
Holt	PERSON	sees it is composed of a few simple elements eom - | bined in a hierarchy w y hich moves from the simplest to the most complex , from the neutral entities of logic , which are neither mind nor matter , to those high , complicated organiza - tions of psychology which combine a special significance with a reducible compositeness .

		Between these two extremes range , in due order , the world of the secondary qualities , of colors and sounds and tastes and smells , the worlds of geometry and mathematics , of phy - sics , of chemistry , of geography , of astron - omy , and of biology , and beyond psychology is to be found the World of values , these being the last terms , in the process of the synthesis of simples , that man knows .

		Considered absolutely , none of the entities which these different sciences deal with pos - sesses a status either in the world of mind or the world of matter .

		It exists on its own
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 121 account , `` neutral '' to both .

		When , however , it is related in a particular way to a group of other entities , it assumes a status , and may be , according to its relation , indifferently both mind and matter at the same time .

		Thus the sky you look at , as and when you look at it , takes its place with a series of beings , all of them related in a specific way to your nervous system and your body .

		Because it is so re - lated , it is a mental image and thought , a sensation , a memory , any psychological form of existence you choose .

		Again , however , in connection with the system of ether waves , of physical tensions and stresses , it is a material fact in the external world .

		In itself it simply is .

		Reality is an infinite collection of such autonomous entities , some irreducible simples , some compounded of such irreducible simples , and all together constituting what Mr.
Holt	PERSON	calls a '' neutral mosaic , '' and all ultimately to be derived from the few elemental logical entities which constitute the walls of the visi - ble and the invisible world .

		This Mr.
Holt	PERSON	demonstrates with a beauti - ful and logical consequentially , and with the adduction of many interesting empirical data .

		He builds his world from neutral entity to mind and values , with a deductive precision and in a sprightly manner which other pro- fessorial philosophers might do well to imi - tate .

		His language is a little difficult , because of his attempt to assimilate all forms of exis - tence to the terms of logic .

		In his vocabulary , facts are propositions and events theorems , etc. ; but once this slight difficulty is over - come the position is plausible enough .

		The world appears as a consistent system , over - whelmingly integrated and logical .

		Unhap - pily .

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's sense of fact gets the better of his sense of logical form .

		The scientist and the artist in him are not at one , and they do not appear to be at one in the particular matter following .

		The world we live in is , of course , a world in which we make mistakes , a world in which error appears .

		The problem of error has been one of the great puzzles in the compensatory tradition , and Mr.
Holt	PERSON	faces it with a cour - age and originality quite without parallel .

		From his point of view , contradictions are as real in the neutral world as consistencies , and error he regards as a clash of contradictory propositions , a struggle for survival between two organizations of being within a given complex .

		This description of error I believe to be correct .

		Unhappily , it is not consistent with the conception of a completely consistent universe .

		If contradictions are real , the uni - verse can not be a unity .

		If the universe is a unitv .

		contradictions can not be real .

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's imagination has carried him farther than his sense of fact has allowed him to go .

		The quality of this imagination is striking , both in the new avenues of vision it opens up for the reader and in the plausibility with which it accounts for many interesting and puzzling details concerning the nature of mind . ''

		The Concept of Consciousness '' is an imaginative achievement of great freshness and dialectical subtlety simply because it has restated so much of the world of experience , with the irreducible uniqueness of its con - tents , in terms of '' logical entities . ''

		But the restatement has been made at the cost of neglecting this qualitative uniqueness in experience , and of violating the desiderated consistency of the system .

		In this respect .

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	is , however , no worse off than any other philosopher who aims to construct a system as well as to describe the universe , and he is much better off with respect to the inter - est of his material and the liveliness of his style .

		His book is easily the foremost contri - bution which the New Realism has as yet made to the art of metaphysics and the near - science of psychology .

AMERICA	LOCATION	AS A COMMERCIAL FIKLD .

		* The majority of the numerous books pur - porting to give information about our South American neighbors resemble the forced plants grown in the superheated atmosphere of a hothouse .

		An artificial interest has drawn them forth from an almost barren soil , poorly fed with scraps of statistics snatched at random from consular reports and commercial publications , and they art ' colored by the pallid tints retained in the retina of unobservant eyes after a hurried trip in some country or other .

		Their literary value is nil ; the information they impart is worse than worthless : it really is misinfor - mation Such books must have a detrimental effect on the relations between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Latin America	LOCATION	, retarding as they do the understanding which will have to ex - ist between the peoples of the two continents if the commercial castles in the air , so fondly reared by some of our business men , are to have their foundations on terra firma .

Feb. 3	DATE	who has spent many years in these southern republics . ''

		His intention is to furnish the reader with information `` which should be of service to those looking at this continent from a money-making , rather than from an his - torical , point of view . ''

		If Mr.
Babson	PERSON	had achieved this purpose , his book would have been unique among the publications on
South America	LOCATION	; but it has fallen short of the self-imposed mark .

		And this could not be otherwise .

		The author is a statistician of country-wide fame .

		Therefore , one is not surprised , but rather expects , that he should attribute great importance to the power of statistics in unravelling the myste - ries of
South America	LOCATION	.

		Statistics , however , like most sciences which depend for their expression upon figures , is entirely impotent in giving 1 an idea of nationality .

		The complexities of a nation nay , of a single indi - vidual , are beyond the reach of mere numer - als .

		The most skilful statistician , armed with the most elaborate and up-to-date statistics , could not have foretold , at the beginning of
last century	DATE	, the enormous engineering and industrial development that was in store for such an unpromising country as
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Again , according to some statistical contem - porary of Charles V ,
Spain	LOCATION	should have been to-day mistress of the world .

		Statistics alone can not reveal to us the future of
South America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Babson	PERSON	is fully aware of the shortcom - ings of statistics .

		He realizes that his science can only be fully understood by experts , and that mere numerals will fail to appeal to the average person `` looking at this continent from a money making .

		.

		point of view . ''

		He therefore indulges in what we might call spectacular statistics , fit for drawing-room entertainment . ''

		If
Massachusetts	LOCATION	were to be extended westward through the Central States to the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, it would be about one hundred and twenty-five miles wide and nearly three thousand miles long .

		Imagine this belt of land turned on end so that it will lie north and south instead of east and west , and you will then have an idea of how large and how peculiar is the shape of
Chile	LOCATION	. ''

		There is in such a metamorphosis something reminiscent of the light-handed conjurer who transforms a rabbit into a pigeon by a simple turn of the hand .

		It is all very cleverly done , and if the mind has not been fatigued by such geographical contortions one may obtain some idea of the location and extent of a country .

		But there is something else infinitely more important than the country itself , and that is its people .

		Mr.
Babson	PERSON	confesses that his '' visits -LSB- to
South America	LOCATION	-RSB- have been short , '' and that in many of the cities he writes about he spent but little time .

		It is only logical , therefore , that he should not have become acquainted with the people of
South America	LOCATION	, as indeed he has not .

		His observant mind , neverthe - less , has perceived that the South Americans , as they exist to-day , are vastly different from the conception formed of them by the North Americans .

		He dispels the myth , entertained by some writers of better intentions than judgment , that the peoples of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	republics are connected with the people of the
United States	LOCATION	by a kinship springing from the similarity of governmental institu - tions .

		The countries of
South America	LOCATION	are republican in government , and their inhabi - tants are imbued with as great a love of flag and country as could be found anywhere else in the world ; but that and no more is the extent of their resemblance to the people of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		They belong to a dif - ferent race and a different civilization .

		The countries are , in the majority of cases , much older than the
United States	LOCATION	; and having been kept , under the long tutelage of
Spain	LOCATION	, secluded from the rest of the world , they have developed traits of character , habits , and customs which are peculiarly their own , and which will not be changed at the bidding of the first American drummer who happens to visit them .

		Mr.
Babson	PERSON	makes all this perfectly clear , and with the insistence necessary to the incul - cation of an all-important lesson ; and there - in , rather than in his statistics , lies the real value of his interesting book .

		123 heard from Guy that there were difficulties which led him to think he would have to choose between love and art .

		So much of a glimpse of
Flashers Mead	ORGANIZATION	there was in '' Sin - ister Street '' ; we now have a fully realized view of a very beautiful and exquisite imagi - nation .

		Whether Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	had in earlier days conceived the story more fully , or whether , in the hours of idleness that must come even to those on an expeditionary force , he picked up the loose threads and worked out a new pattern , would be hard to say , and perhaps not worth while .

		But it may well be in these days in which a tragic possibility impends over all that younger gen - eration to which he belongs , that Mr.
Macken	PERSON	- zie has desired to leave some record of the beauty of the
England	LOCATION	and the English life of to-day .

		At any rate , we have the life at
Flashers Mead	ORGANIZATION	told not from the standpoint of the queerly sophisticated set at
Oxford	LOCATION	, but almost as from the charming but whimsi - cal old rectory .

		The book , like so much of
England	LOCATION	, has wonderful beauty ; also like
England	LOCATION	, there impends over it a sense of a terrible outcome .

		Those who know Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	will have already read ''
Flashers Mead	PERSON	, '' and will have found in it the same beauty and life of youth that runs so joyfully and with such strains of melancholy through his other books : the places and people are as good as in `` Youth 's Encounter , '' the story as good -LRB- and as bad -RRB- as that of `` Carnival . ''

		Those who have never read Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	will find his latest a good book to begin with , for it has most of his strong points and few of his weaknesses .

		By this publication Mr.
Compton Macken	PERSON	- zie puts himself ahead , begins to get out of the group that one rather thinks of together .

		Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	's latest book was allowed only a brief moment of circulation , so we think of him still as we have thought of him before .

		Mr.
Hugh	PERSON	``
Walpole	LOCATION	has allowed him - self something of a breathing-space in pro- ducing '' The Golden Scarecrow . ''

		We have seen nothing of late by Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	or by Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	.

		So Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	rather emerges from the younger generation .

		Viewing him thus , one rather asks why there is anything in these books that one will not find elsewhere .

		If it comes to presenting merely a charming or exquisite quality of life , there are certainly many who can do that sort of thing .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	or Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- bers would be enough for the average taste .

		Or if it was for the rather acrid and sordid quality that is nowadays somewhat the fash - ion , there are a good many people who supply that too , Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, say , or Mr.
Somerset Maugham	PERSON	.

		But it is not because he is charm - ing and exquisite on the one hand , or acrid and sordid on the other , or indeed because he is both together that Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	is worth reading : it is because he is such a mas - ter of the facts of youth , because he knows so much of its seriousness , its triviality , its tragedy , its exhilaration , its ignorance , as well as of the follies or fancies , gaieties and delights , and other things wherein youth shares the lot of more exercised mortality .

		Of these things Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	offers a rich and well-filled record , and for these things one could ignore more defects than he otherwise has .

		In `` Flashers Mead '' Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	is at his best .

		It is not that the book is about more pleasing and attractive people and places than may readily be found in '' Carnival '' or '' Sinister Street , '' for the pleasing and attrac - tive is often enough too much of an end in itself .

		Nor is it that the book seems nearer to life and truer than some parts of Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's other work , although that would probably strike a good many readers .

		It is because the whole thing is so entirely fused in the imagination that it makes its impres - sion definitely and surely as the writer would wish .

		Its characters , its setting , its story all go together , and make a piece of work such as one does not often meet . ''

		The Golden Scarecrow '' may be some - thing of a disappointment to those who have read `` The Duchess of Wrexe , '' not to say others of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's books , so it should be said at once that it is a book of a different kind .

		For one thing , it is not a novel ; it is a series of sketches bound together only by the idea which informs them all .

		And though we may say that the interest in a story is not the highest literary interest , yet it is certainly the case that when the story is lack - ing we find it more difficult , at first at least , to fix our attention on what there is .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	is good at a story : from '' The Gods and Mr.
Perrin	PERSON	. ''

		where you go right along with the people in a very dramatic narration , to `` The Duchess of Wrexe , '' a much fuller book with more analysis , his books have a story .

		`` The Golden Scarecrow '' does not .

		Nor does it at first sight deal with the same things that Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	has generally dealt with ; it does not have the interest of a bit of the world , representative or not , in which microcosm we follow with interest some of the writer 's feelings and thoughts on life in gen - eral .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's previous books , especially 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	the latest of them , seemed to be a study of some of the things in the world of our time or perhaps only of the
England	LOCATION	of the twen - tieth century , that Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	thought inter - esting .

		It is not remarkable that , in a time of such social turmoil and upheaval , Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	should not have seen his way clear to going on with his analysis of that social order which is now being so terribly shaken .

		He might easily have turned aside to some quite different idea that stood by itself , in - stead of continuing the work already an - nounced .

		That he should do so was very natural , perhaps inevitable ; but so also is it natural , perhaps inevitable , that people who have thought of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	in one way should like to find him what they have found him .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	, of course , feels that his latest book has its definite place in his work , in - deed , in a way it certainly has ; it is put among his other things as one of the '' studies of place . ''

		But the book will hardly make its impression as a study of place .

		The people who read it will think it a series of sketches of children -LRB- who , it is true , all lived in
March	DATE	Square -RRB- based on what may well enough seem more of a fancy than anything else .

		All that sounds a bit discouraging .

		But really , `` The Golden Scarecrow '' is a very interesting book , and has a perfectly definite relation to the rest of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's work , so that all his readers ought to read it thor - oughly .

		It is hardly -LRB- to my mind -RRB- a study of place , any more than some of Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- pole 's other books so called .

		It is really a development of the theme that '' Heaven lies about us in our infancy ; Shades of the prison house begin to close Upon the growing 1 boy . '' ''

		Shades of the prison house '' have gener - ally been present in Mr.
Walpole	LOCATION	's books .

		Mr.
Perrin	PERSON	in that dreadful school-world of
Moffatt	PERSON	's , Maradick in the daily life which at forty has often become so definitely set ,
Olva Dune	PERSON	dissolving the bond of secrecy before the football match ,
Rachel Beaminster	PERSON	in the world of hard and fast determina - tion of which her grandmother the Duchess was the dominant mistress , in fact , it is to be seen in all of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's books as far as I remember .

		His people find themselves limited , bound down , almost bricked up in a wall -LRB- as who does not now and then ? -RRB-

		by whatever set of circumstances makes up their life , and to each there comes at one time or another the chance to break away .

		This is the great moment in each life , and each acts in the same way .

		They do not break away ; each sees that the thing to do is not to break away but to keep on , not to succumb to the imperious surrounding but to master it and live differently .

		Each finds out that '' the prison unto which we doom ourselves no prison is . ''

		Each becomes , not reconciled to that which was before unbearable , but able in some way or other to see how it can be made not a restraint but an opportunity .

		Each gets a new strength , a new power in life .

		This would seem to be Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's philoso - phy of life , his idea of how one may live finely , never expressed as a consistent scheme , but never absent in his work .

		The latest book of his shows us the begin - ning of such things .

		Children -LRB- if we follow the thought of the great poet , which Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- pole seems to have adopted -RRB- live at first finely ; as time goes on they are broken in to life .

		But in those early years they are still aware of that great Friend -LRB- especially , it has been often thought , of children -RRB- who as life goes on they see and hear less and less often .

		He will doubtless be with them later in life when they need him , but he fades out of daily existence .

		In such a way does this latest book of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's take its place with the rest of his work .

		Of course it is not an explanation of the great mystery : Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	is stating no creed ; and very wisely , for people would not understand it .

		It is a fanciful story , it does not pretend even to take itself seriously ; but then , Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	explains all that at the beginning , as when he compares Mr.
Pidgen	PERSON	.

		the man who had let his fancy run away with him , with Mr.
Lasher	PERSON	, who was a much more practical person , and goes on : `` Of course , the ideal thing is somewhere between the two ; recognize St.
Christopher	PERSON	and see the real world as well . ''

		Or else a page or two later , when Mr.
Pidgen	PERSON	tells the boy : '' ' The more you live in your head , dreaming and seeing things that are n't there , the less you 'll see the things that are there .

		You 'll always be tumbling over things .

		You 'll never get on .

		You 'll never be a success . '

		` Never mind , ' said
Hugh	PERSON	, ' it does n't matter much what you say now , you 're only talking `` for my good '' like Mr.
Lasher	PERSON	. ' ''

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	has usually shown us the real world , or rather the world as it appears to be , so he may well enough do the other thing now .

		Perhaps some time he will get '' the ideal thing ... somewhere between the two . ''

		These books offer food for thought to those earnest inquirers who are asking -LRB- in the lit -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 125 erary papers -RRB- how the war will influence literature .

		It is evident that it will not ere - ; ate a '' war-literature '' resonant with the sound of drums and tramplings .

		One of the most sympathetic souls of our time has asked , '' AVho is there among us who would have the I heart , while his country is in agony and his brothers are dying , to write a drama or ; a romance ? ''

		Both Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	| and Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	take the situation j seriously : both are doing practical work , one in the hospital service , and the other with \ the
Russian Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither fiddles while | the city is in flames .

		And the war leads them !

		to produce , the one an exquisite idyl , and the \ other a fanciful tale about children .

		Yet few ' readers will fancy that these are works un - worthy a time of so great a tension of spirit .

		Arm-chair excursions .

		BRIEFS ox NBW BOOKS .

		Much of the quiet humor , the delightful drollery , the ingrati - ating intimacy of personal con - fession , the seventeenth-century turn of expression , that make the `` Essays of Elia '' so pleasing , will be found in the several brief disquisitions composing the `` Journeys to
Bagdad	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Charles S. Brooks	PERSON	, a volume bearing quite conspicuously the Yale stamp , which should do it no disservice with its read - ers .

		The
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	attractively publishes this product of a
Yale	ORGANIZATION	pen , some of its contents having already appeared in '' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		and others in `` The New Re - public . ''

		The first paper , which gives its name to the collection , treats of imaginary journeys to the city of `` Arabian Nights '' fame , journeys of a sort far more enjoyable in these days than would be the real ones .

		Then come chapters on such inviting themes as `` The Worst Edition of Shakespeare '' -LRB- which is
John Bell	PERSON	's -RRB- , `` The Decline of Nightcaps , '' `` Maps and Rabbit Holes , '' '' Tunes for
Spring	DATE	, '' and five more in all a most enjoyable half-score of genially humor - ous and sometimes deliciously droll exercises in imagination and fancy , in musing and memory and invention .

		In justification of the comparison of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's style with
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's , let a sentence or two be quoted . ''

		There is nothing to-day more de - generate . ''

		asserts this modern lover of things ancient , '' than our title-pages .

		It is in a mean spirit that we pinch and starve them .

		I commend the older kind wherein , gener - ously ensampled .

		is the promise of the rich diet that shall follow . ''

		`` This shows / ' in another connection , `` that gossipry must be judged by its effects .

		If it allay the stone or give a pleasant evening it should have reward instead of punishment . ''

		`` My nose may serve by way of ornament or for the sniffing of the heavier odors , yet will fail in the nice detection of the faint waftings and olfactory ticklings . ''

		This last will recall Lamb 's mod - est disclaimer of that fineness of hearing characteristic of the '' ear for music . ''

		But it is cause for regret to find Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's nice sense of the shades of meaning in words fail him almost at the very opening of the book . ''

		If smells were bears , how often would I be bit ! ''

		he exclaims ; and this misuse of '' would '' recurs more than once in the subse - quent pages which would disturb one far less in a less admirable author .

		A return to the good old-fashioned woodcut is to be noted in the book 's illustrations , which are con - ceived and executed in the spirit of the text by Mr.
Allen Lewis	PERSON	.

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's interesting 1 '' '' 1 an < * very readable chapters on '' Inventors and Money-Makers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were originally delivered as lec - tures at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of that institution .

		The author is frankly psychological in his approach and treatment , and holds that a fundamental constructive tendency in human nature is the parent trait responsible for in - ventor and money-maker alike .

		That trait has been given a large stage , a versatile ex - pression , an abundant reward , and has also acquired a comprehensive complication with other derived forms of instinctive trends , in the world so full of a number of things in which as best we can we seek to move , make a living , and develop such being as fate or - dains .

		The competitive instinct , which makes men fighters and workers for causes and schemes , makes a close partnership with the constructive trait , and enlists the vitality of the will to prevail in the interest of the will to create .

		Yet at the economic level the minor differentiations of these tendencies count , and bring it about that the inventor and the promoter and money-maker are found inhabiting different tenements of clay .

		The marketing of a product , and the shrewdness to foresee the interactions of supply and de - mand , bring to the front a different perspec - tive of qualities than those in which invention is or remains central .

		The treatment is fit - tingly brought to a conclusion by a chapter on `` Altruism : The Instinct of Devotion . ''

		This points a moral as well as adorns a well THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 3	DATE	told tale .

		Money-making and invention , and the array of minor devotions which they encourage and to which they give expression , are so many forms of personality ; this con - clusion is suggestive because it means that business motives are strangely mixed and intricately blended with many others fail - ings and virtues alike which give the lie to the commonplace that business is business .

		The fuller and truer reason why business absorbs is that it gives real play , in the way of ready suggestion and necessary economic relations , to a creditable variety of human traits .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's little volume may be cordially recommended to the business as well as to the academic mind .

		The crowd and
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are certain excellences in the work on '' Politics and Crowd Morality '' -LRB- Button -RRB- by the late
Arthur Christensen	PERSON	, a patriotic
Dane	PERSON	of ample experience in political life .

		His criticism of democracy is a clear-eyed picture of its defects ; and from the recent political history of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	he has collected an effective array of instances of the breakdown of democratic forms .

		He gives a pessimistic account of the `` interstate politics '' of the world ; and his strictures upon the selfish policies pursued by the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	, and the danger to smaller countries and backward races , as Avell as to the Powers themselves , involved in these ten - dencies , have been amply justified by the war which has broken out since the first publica - tion of his book .

		But as an attempt to construct a new theory of democratic government , and to demonstrate a new set of political princi - ples , founded upon a careful social psychol - ogy , the book is unsatisfactory .

		In the first place , it slavishly follows the general theories of crowd psychology , and of the interaction between the individual and the mass , worked out twenty years ago by Le Bon and Tarde , without due recognition of the fact that these men have exaggerated the irrational behavior of crowds , and that their explanation of what irrationalities do exist , by `` suggestion , '' '' imitation , '' '' counter-suggestion , '' and so on , is vague and inadequate .

		In the second place , it bases its solution of the problem of provid - ing an efficient democratic government upon theories that none but a special school of labor leaders can consider tenable .

		Having argued that human societies are ignorant , prejudiced , and excitable , and that their members often urge each other into what the Germans call `` waking hypnosis , '' he goes on to suggest a substitute for this government by the unorganized crowd .

		This is based upon the organization of society into professional and trade groups .

		There is to be a quasi - syndicalist constitution ; each special func - tion in the
State	ORGANIZATION	is to be exercised by the specialists in that function ; and differences are to be composed , and common interests controlled , by the representatives of different economic groups .

		The methods by which Mr.
Christensen	PERSON	shows that trade and profes - sional corporations are `` rational '' and `` natural , '' as opposed to the irrational and artificial crowd , are interesting examples of forced and unsound reasoning .

		Until our labor unions , professional societies , and man - agerial boards show more conclusively that they are exempt from the general frailties and passions common to all groups of human beings , democratic nations will depend upon the present mass constituencies for govern - ment .

		A study of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, by JJSfSf JJgJ * Mr.
W. L. George	PERSON	, the English novelist and feminist , is one of the first volumes in the '' Writers of the Day '' series -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	is in some ways well equipped for his task owing to his French schooling and his comparative freedom from Anglo-Saxon and puritanic prejudices .

		Ana - tole
France	LOCATION	, as someone has said , represents the consummate flowering of the Latin genius ; to entrust the interpretation of him to a man unappreciative of the esprit gaulois would have been sheer barbarism .

		If we assume the object of the series to be informational as well as merely critical , we may say that Mr.
George	PERSON	has done his work well .

		His account is lucid , well-balanced , and sympathetic .

		For the ignoramus or the moderately informed there is plenty of sustenance .

		Nevertheless , the real lover of
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	will experience some slight disappointment .

		There is no subtle insight and no warm glow of enthusiasm .

		Connoisseurs will also deprecate certain state - ments , notably the phrase about `` the dap - per quality '' of the Frenchman 's thought , where the adjective seems peculiarly inappro - priate , and the further assertion that
M. France	LOCATION	is sentimental .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	announces at the outset that he has read very few books or articles about
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		It might have been better if he had read more .

		Per - haps in that case he would not have been so categorical in his denial of any evolution in his author .

		To many it appears that since the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair there is a ground-tone of earn - estness in
M. France	LOCATION	's work which was scarcely perceptible before .

		Ironical , skeptical , genially tolerant as ever , the dilettante has become , like
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 and tke executive another mocker ,
Heine	PERSON	, a '' valiant soldier in the war of humanity 's liberation . ''

		The writ - er 's judgments on individual books are gener - ally sound .

		He would apparently select as the best of his author ''
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	'' and `` L'lle des Pingouins . ''

		One very delightful book , '' La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque , '' seems to have escaped his notice entirely .

		Professor
E. B. Gowin	PERSON	has writ - ten a timely book which he calls `` The Executive and His Con - trol of Men : A Study in Personal
Effi	PERSON	- ciency '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its timeliness consists in the appeal to current interests and the mode of their practical expression which the subject carries .

		It can not be said that it rises to the level of less ephemeral timeliness by advancing insight into the problems which it treats interestingly but rather aimlessly .

		On the psychological side it contains a praise - worthy contribution , which is the result of a very extended questionnaire circulated with unusual success in coaxing returns .

		The re - plies of successful men in forty callings show convincingly that in the long run and the ; short sprint physique tells .

		The `` big '' men in achievement are taller and heavier than the average . ''

		Superintendents of I street cleaning '' are the heavyweights , and `` psychologists '' the lightweights , among the forty professions thus immortalized ; only '' reformers '' are taller than the '' superin - tendents . ''

		while publishers and -LRB- most of all -RRB- musicians are small men .

		The defect of stat - ure of musicians is so striking that it must have some other -LRB- racial ? -RRB-

		than an occupa - tional selection as its clue .

		But apart from this statistical investigation , the central pur - pose of the volume is to direct attention to the quality of energy and the glory of its organi - zation that in the modern world bring power and wealth to the man who can control and direct his fellow men .

		The enormous empha - sis which modern industrial life , and the many phases of human interest patterned after this type of efficiency , places upon this aspect of human quality entitles it to the most comprehensive and intensive study that industry and insight can command .

		From the volume in hand the reader will gain a suggestive realization of the many factors which determine the expression of this much rewarded quality .

		He will see it pictured in j theory and practice , illuminated by psycho - logical principles and illustrated by practical achievement .

		And for the most part he will I carry away a more definite notion of the , executive functions and their economic sig - nificance .

		Beyond this he may gain little , and may even leave the volume with the uneasy feeling of hopes aroused and disap - pointed .

		But the book will doubtless find a grateful as well as a lenient clientele , and thus fulfil the well intentioned purpose of the author .

		college ^ T -
Harry Parker Ward	PERSON	's vol - ume on `` Some American College Book-plates '' -LRB-
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	:
Champlin Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an addition of genuine value to book-plate literature .

		The body of the volume consists of 360 pages of reproduc - tions of well chosen plates from a large num - ber of educational institutions in all parts of the country , including a few from learned societies , museums , etc. , and a few from well known individuals with such college connec - tions as to make their appearance not inappro - priate .

		Harvard is represented by about thirty of the two or three hundred plates which distinguish various collections in her great library .

		The reproduction is skilfully done , and certainly reflects credit on the
Champlin Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are a dozen inset prints from the original plates .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has had the cooperation of Mr.
Theodore Wes	PERSON	- ley
Koch	PERSON	, Librarian of the
University of Mich	ORGANIZATION	- igan .

		who contributes a very interesting `` Defense of Book-plates , '' embracing some sensible suggestions to anyone who may wish to secure a plate for his own books .

		Mr.
Win	PERSON	- ward
Prescott	PERSON	.

		a well known authority and member of the best book-plate societies in this country and
Europe	LOCATION	, contributes a check-list of book-plate literature covering nearly fifty pages , the most complete bibliography of the kind yet presented .

		This is prefaced by some good suggestions to the collector .

		The acci - dental inclusion of a
University of Chicago Quadrangle Club	ORGANIZATION	plate among the
Princeton	LOCATION	specimens is unfortunate , but in a piece of work so carefully done as a whole it may be pardoned , - Many incidents in a career like A Napoleonic -LCB- hat o f XapoleOU HlUSt DC put itinerary ... * 2 r in their local setting to be rully understood .

		Even the `` look '' of the place enhances the sense of reality , if nothing more .

		To furnish this important element is the spe - cial aim of Mr.
James Morgan	PERSON	's `` In the Footsteps of Napoleon '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has studied the framework of his inci - dents on the spot , although it required jour - neys aggregating twenty thousand miles .

		He has followed his hero from the boyhood scenes in
Corsica	LOCATION	, to his schools at
Brienne	PERSON	and
Paris	LOCATION	, his garrison at
Valence	LOCATION	, along the route of all his campaigns , from
1796	DATE	to
1815	DATE	.

		giving here a paragraph , there a page , to a 128 THE DIAL
Feb. 3	DATE	house , a palace , a battlefield , or an Alpine pass .

		For example , from the legendary tower of Theodoric , which rises in an orchard at
Marengo	LOCATION	, he asks the reader to look out over the plain which stretches away to Ales - sandria , and which he compares to a '' great football field , bordered on either side by hills that rise like the tiers of a grandstand , '' the river Bormida at one end and the heights of
San Giuliano	LOCATION	at the other .

		In a similar way he describes the countryside between
Briinn	PERSON	and the village of Austerlitz .

		The wonder is that he did not take his camera with him and give us photographs of the more interesting places , instead of illustrating his volume with cheap reproductions of familiar paintings , many of which are utterly valueless for the study of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		As a biography this book will scarcely take a conspicuous place in the increasing volume of Napoleonic studies .

		Many statements represent traditional rather than critical views .

		The description of the constitution of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	, to cite an in - stance , shows little comprehension of its real character .

		The conception of Professor .4 plebiscite on Foster
F. Boswell	PERSON	's '' The Aims college education .

		i - r - * < t ~ t 11 - ni and Defects of College Educa - tion '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is admirable .

		In Part I are presented a number of letters , and excerpts from letters , written by more or less promi - nent Americans in reply to two questions sent out by Prof essor
Boswell	PERSON	: -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` What traits of character and mind should a college aim to develop in its students to make them useful and efficient in modern life ? ''

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- `` In what ways does the present college education fail in giving students training it is able to give ? ''

		Those addressed were men in public life , college presidents , professors in the more practical departments of great universities , journalists , and business men .

		The answers are interesting in the light of their authorship as well as intrinsically ; but they are so various that it would be difficult to do them collective justice , despite Professor
Boswell	PERSON	's claim that they show a remarkable unity .

		Certain defects attributed to college students are noted in several letters , `` slipshod and superficial work done for the purpose of ` get - ting by , ' '' unpunctuality , social arrogance , lack of initiative ; and it is true that the gen - eral trend of these letters from '' practical '' men rather surprisingly emphasizes the impor - tance of the more general and cultural stud - ies as a basis for professional or business life .

		The second part of the volume is made up of Professor
Boswell	PERSON	's comments and conclusions on the data provided by the letters .

		A strik - ing defect in the method of carrying out the conception of the book lies in its narrow range , the somewhat local character of the business men quoted , and the fairly dogmatic and absolute conclusions drawn from answers of persons apparently selected with some care by the investigator .

		A careful study of Eliza Hay - ry .

		wood , one of the lesser known eighteenth century novelists , who wrote passionate romances , secret histo - ries , and novels of scandal , a few stories that may be classed as novels of domestic life , attempted the drama , and figured as one of Pope 's victims in the '' Dunciad , '' has been made by Dr.
George Frisbie Whicher	PERSON	, of the

Haywood	PERSON	has been described as `` the most voluminous female writer '' that
Great Britain	LOCATION	has pro- duced .

		Mr.

		Although one contemporary poet -LRB- not Pope -RRB- affirms : '' You sit like Heav 'n' s bright minister on High , Command the throbbing Breast , and watry Eye , '' present day readers will feel hardly more than an antiquarian interest in her work .

		Yet `` The History of Miss Betsy Thought - less '' -LRB-
1751	DATE	-RRB- is not without merit as an ex - periment in the fiction that draws upon everyday life .

		Dr.
Whicher	PERSON	's monograph is vivaciously written , and presents its subject with much interesting and informing detail .

		l > 4 THE MISCELLANY 17
Board of Trade Kansas City	ORGANIZATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 133 How Sanatogen Relieves Poor Digestion and Nerve Strain DIGESTION and the nervous system are interdependent .

		For while the products of digestion nourish the nerve cells , the nerves in turn control digestion .

		Thus if aught wrongly affects either the nerves or the digestive organs the other also must suffer .

		When , for instance , worry , overwork or shock interferes with digestion , the result - ant lack of nourishment weakens the ner - vous system , causing nerve-strain .

		This nerve-weakness then reacts and still further disturbs the faulty digestion .

		At such times Sanatogen is specifically helpful first , because it is so easily assimi - lated by even an enfeebled digestion , and , second , because Sana togen 's chemical union of purest protein and organic phosphorus furnishes precisely the two elements most needed to restore aot only the weakened digestion but the impoverished nerve cells as well .

		This explains why
Colonel Warterson	PERSON	, the famous American editor , was able to write : '' I do not think I could have recovered my vitality , as I have done , without this Sanatogen operating equally upon the digestive organs and nerve centers . ''

		And why Hon.
Wm. E. Chandler	PERSON	, former Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, wrote : `` Sanatogen is a pleasant nutriment for cases of impaired digestion .

		It strength - ens without irritating and promotes vitality in feeble folks . ''

		It also explains the striking endorsement of the medical profession as expressed in signed letters from over 21,000 physicians who have watched the work of Sanatogen in countless cases .

		And it gives you the reason why we are so confident that
Sanatogen	PERSON	can help you when you give it an opportunity .

		Sanatogen is sold by good druggists everywhere in three sizes , from

		They are one of the greatest curiosities of the age , and the most uncommon and original collection of

		The first portfolio contains a beautiful parchment title-page -LRB- to be used in a permanent binding -RRB- , illuminated in red , gold and black .

		The manuscripts themselves are printed on antique stock in black ink over a buff-tinted background , which gives a very realistic antique look .

		By the Old Person I do n't mean old as aged , but old as against young : middle-old ; the person who has done with , or done for , the business of mating ; of whom one says , he hath or hath not hair , good spirits , or a waist - line ; who is credited with playing a fair game for his age ; who , gazing upon the lessening delight of his image in the morning glass , assures himself that he feels as young as ever and that youth is an overrated affair anyhow .

		In short , I mean the person who , but a little while ago , could have comforted himself with the reflection that it was he , and not the youngster bawling at the piano yonder , who was acknowledged heir to all ages past and sponsor for the years to come .

		But a little while ago !

		Before Dr.
Osier	PERSON	made his fateful remark ; before the motor had speeded up life and the movie had speeded up the drama ; before Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, and the rest , began so sportively to expound the inferiority of parents .

		We who were born in the seventies and eighties who among us ever doubted that his father and mother in their green middle age were the real thing , that it was they who were doing the real business of living , and that the world was , on the whole , properly arranged for their comfort and convenience ?

		Pater - familias was not a word of mockery then ; it stood for a reality , official and
august	DATE	; nor was his consort a person to be flouted .

		They demanded respect of us , and we innocently yielded it to them .

		Well , we begin now to see how weak of us that must have been .

		There , we may sup - pose , was our lost opportunity .

		Who knows ?

		If it had occurred to us to assert ourselves , to oppose the wisdom of youth to the dried formulas of age , we might have found father amenable enough behind his dundrearys , mother apologetic enough under her shawl .

		But it did not occur to us .

		We might , in sanguine hours , aspire to hoodwink those ancients , but alas , we never dreamed of brow - beating them .

		Thus , it appears , we fell be - tween two stools .

		For times changed , and manners with them ; and somehow , when at 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	last we had grown up , and produced de - scendants , and -LRB- feeling that it was now our turn -RRB- placed ourselves in a convenient atti - tude to be respected and deferred to by them , all we got for our pains was a stare and a giggle , and a rear view of careless youthful shoulders .

		This kind of shock has to be met .

		In a way we have adapted ourselves to it ; the new order even has its compensations .

		Side - whiskers and shawls have vanished with the authority they symbolized .

		Some privileges we expected to sacrifice on the altar of middle age remain to us .

		`` We may be as light - minded and irresponsible as we choose .

		Since nobody has any respect for us anyhow , we need not waste time standing on our dignity .

		We need no longer pretend to be infallible , as persons of our age had to a generation ago .

		We need not wear rubbers or abstain from smoking for the sake of our influence , since we possess nothing of the kind .

		It is not to be wondered at that this sudden emancipa - tion reacts upon us in striking ways .

		We skit , we gambol in the open , we cavort to measure in enclosed pens , shamelessly vying with our juniors .

		One of these days some clever fellow -LRB- presumably English -RRB- will remark that the man is father to the child , and so win applause as begetter of a brilliant paradox .

		And yet somehow the situation is n't all comfort and luxury for us .

		In sober moments we have an uneasy feeling that there is a screw loose somewhere , and that it ought to be attended to if the old machine is to be kept going .

		Life is n't all beer and skittles , even since the Victorians lugged their adages off the scene .

		There has to be some sort of responsibility and authority somewhere .

		Here is the matter of books and reading , for instance .

		Under the regime that flour - ished in our own youth , we were supposed to be protected from certain manifestations of literary art .

		The theory was applied rather loosely to the literature of the past .

		Bowdler went sniffing among the pages of the school Shakespeare , but no parent thought of deny - ing his child the home edition .

		Infants were urged to read the
Bible	LOCATION	through , and hideous passages were mumbled over at family prayers . ''

		Don Juan '' was probably at hand behind the glass doors of the black-walnut bookcase ; and among the musty old calf vol - umes on the top shelf , an inquiring hand might even search out a ''
Tom Jones	PERSON	'' or a ``
Roderick Random	PERSON	. ''

		But as for contempo - rary literature , theory and practice were firm enough .

		`` Virginibus puerisque , '' our eld - ers lived and wrote in the fear of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	.

		I dare say they felt that to be them - selves worthy of respect , they must reverence that young mind , they must take care not to outrage those pure youthful sensibilities .

		There were large spaces of fact and fancy from which the young must be restrained till the little wings were strong enough to bear them safely through those perilous chaotic regions .

		All that has been changed pretty thor - oughly .

		Childhood is still guarded after a fashion .

		We make some attempt , at least , to distract infancy from the salty fare of con - temporary fiction by plying it with specially concocted sweetmeats known as '' children 's books . ''

		Meantime the age of literary consent has been steadily pushed back to the nether verge of adolescence .

		The fact is , youth in its teens is no longer the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	, the innocent ward of age and experience .

		It is humanity in the ascendant , the ruling power , which has a right to know what sort of world it is set to rule over .

		In short , it must get to know `` life '' by the shortest cuts possible .

		For its edification , therefore , the magazines and the book-stalls and the theatres , and here and there a public library , are setting forth without stint `` the elementary facts of life . ''

		Now we all know what that means not much more and nothing less than the risky or the seamy side of sex .

		This new order of things permits the most isolated of budding maidens to inspect a world of print in which sexual passion , with or without a veil of romantic glamour , stalks proudly at noonday .

		A very little reading in the right quarters will in - struct her , on the one hand , how not to become a white slave , and , on the other , how to be - come a mistress , with or without the wedding ring .

		I think the cheap glamourists have most to answer for .

		I have daughters , and I wish they would read that manly animal Fielding instead of the gilded prurience of Mr.
R. W. Chambers	PERSON	and his crew .

		In all this pseud ` o-lore of sex the maiden we know is a hoary grandmother , compared with the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	of half a century ago , her own grandmother in the flesh .

		Her , the reverent or if you like sentimental art of that period loved to picture in well-disposed ring - lets , dove on finger , gazing innocently from
1916	DATE	THE DIAL 143 her chamber-window upon a world which was all a sweet and tolerably silly mystery to her .

		Her descendant carries a cigarette upon her finger , and strides through the streets look - ing about critically , and sees no reason for any mystery whatever about her soul or her ankles , and indeed there is little room for speculation about either .

		She does n't mind if the Old Person thinks her vulgar , as long as nobody can fairly accuse her of being gen - teel .

		As for reading , give her books that deal fearlessly with `` life . ''

		She has her opinion about
Strindberg	LOCATION	, and she will discourse you cheerfully upon real books like ``
Ann Veron	PERSON	- ica , '' which shows what a fine thing it is to be a free female , or '' The Dark Flower , '' which shows what rotten humbugs middle-aged men are .

		At this point I may cheerfully -LRB- and con - veniently -RRB- own that I was set upon my little journey of inquiry by a suggestion let fall by the editor of THE DIAL in a letter written to me about a year ago . ''

		I have sometimes thought , '' he said , `` that the entire problem has gradually been turned topsy-turvy of recent years , that the mass of realistic nov - els and plays now appearing are frankly in - tended for the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	, who is their most numerous , most understanding , and most appreciative patron ; and that it is the older generation , reared in a more reticent or -LRB- if you will -RRB- narroicer tradition , whose suscepti - bilities really need shielding and sheltering . ''

		The passage which I have italicized espe - cially stuck in my mind : I believe there is a whimsical truth in it , and that the younger generation now and then show signs of real - izing it .

		I happen to have heard very re - cently of two incidents in point , both of which befell Old Persons of my own little town .

		One of them is a bachelor , a devoted church - man , and very fond of boys .

		Last winter , in all innocence , he treated a group of choir - boys and acolytes to the most revolting brothel-play Broadway has thus far pro- duced .

		Apparently it made little impression on the boys , but .

		said one of them , '' It was too bad Mr. X was kind of broken up , I guess . ''

		The other instance is of another contemporary of mine , a cultivated woman -LRB- as we used to say -RRB- , with a daughter of -LRB- as we used to say -RRB- marriageable age .

		The daughter not long ago took her to a play which was scoring a nota - ble run in
New York	LOCATION	.

		You observe that the daughter took her , to begin with . ''

		It was a dreadful play , '' said my contemporary , in re - porting the incident , `` not only wicked , but vulgarly wicked .

		Mildred seemed quite en - thralled . '

		It 's so real , ' she kept saying , when - ever the worst things were happening .

		I stood it till the end of the second act , and then I said to her , '
Mildred	PERSON	, if you think this is the kind of play to bring your mother to , I do n't . '

		It did n't occur to me how funny that was till later .

		I do n't think it occurred to her at all .

		She was rather annoyed at hav - ing to go , but I believe she really felt she might n't have done her duty by me ! ''

		The
Comic Spirit	ORGANIZATION	might here discern the basis for a reasonable adjustment of the new relation , a working proposition , as it were .

		It is clear that the moral works of society can not run without a balance-wheel of inno - cence somewhere .

		If the young are to repu - diate that function , npon their shoulders should lie the responsibility of its mainte - nance .

		`` We took no end of trouble with them once : now why should n't they return the compliment ?

		Let them change the tag to `` Viris femimsque reverentia debetur , '' and be a little gingerly with us , in common hu - manity .

		Very cheerfully , for our part , we might render them the respect due to supe - rior wisdom , with its burden of mysterious and unpleasant duties .

		Very contentedly we might leave them to their literary grubbing in \ the muck-heaps of human nature and expe - rience , until such time as they might weary of that sorry task .

		For the time would come : I can not believe , at least , that they would willingly bequeath such tasks , responsibilities | so carking and so dingy , to their children .

		Who knows but even in our own time the !

		wheel will come full circle , and the status of !

		the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	be in some measure -LRB- not bodily , let us hope ! -RRB-

		restored , by those who | in their day have experienced the perils and the penalties of the prematurely old ?

		NEW NOTES ON
POE	ORGANIZATION	'S EAELT TEARS .

		There are still sundry dark places in the life of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		For this no one is so much i responsible as the poet himself .

		He was j extremely fond of mystifying his public ; and j where he did not resort to mystification or to misrepresentation , as happened more than I once he was disposed to observe a more or 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	less complete silence with regard to himself .

		In particular he was inclined to reticence con - cerning his early life in
London	LOCATION	and Rich - mond and
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Several years ago I succeeded , through a partial examination of the letters and office-books of the business firm to which the poet 's foster-father ,
John Allan	PERSON	, belonged -LRB- papers now in the posses - sion of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	and known as the ``
Ellis	PERSON	-
Allan	PERSON	Papers '' -RRB- , in .

		clearing away some of the obscurities that have sur - rounded
Poe	PERSON	's earliest years in
London	LOCATION	and
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		I am now able , as a result of a further examination of these papers , to throw light on certain other obscure or disputed points in his history at this time .

		And I have , through an examination of certain court records and of the files of several old news - papers , and a re-examination in the light of these of the evidence already at hand , man - aged also to uncover one or two new facts about his life in
Baltimore	LOCATION	in the early thirties .

		I .

		The most interesting of the new bits of information that I have come across in the
Ellis	PERSON	-
Allan Papers	ORGANIZATION	is a bill for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's schooling in
London	LOCATION	in
1816	DATE	.

		This document makes it clear that
Poe	PERSON	was not a pupil , as has been generally supposed and as he himself held -LRB- ``
Virginia	LOCATION	Poe , '' I , p. 344 -RRB- , at the school of the Rev.
John Bransby	PERSON	at
Stoke Newington	LOCATION	throughout his five years ' stay in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- 1815-20 -RRB- , but that he spent a part of this time at a school in the city of
London	LOCATION	a boarding school kept by the Misses Dubourg in
Sloane	LOCATION	street , near the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	.

		This bill runs as follows : Masr .

		Allan 's School Acct .

Rect Edgar	PERSON	's School Acct to midsumr
1816	DATE	-LSB- -RSB- 12-2-0 . ''

		On a slip of paper accompanying the bill is a re - ceipt bearing date
July 6 , 1816	DATE	, and signed by
George Dubourg	PERSON	.

		On the cash-book of the firm of
Allan & Ellis	ORGANIZATION	there appears under the same date the following entry : `` pd Miss Dubourgs a/c for
Edgar	PERSON	-LSB- -RSB- 12-2-0 . ''


George Dubourg	PERSON	was a brother of the Misses Dubourg , as appears from several letters in the collection , and was employed by
Allan & Ellis	ORGANIZATION	in 1816-7 as a book-keeper and copyist in their
London	LOCATION	establishment .

		That
Poe	PERSON	was also a pupil of the Misses Dubourg in
the second half of 1816	DATE	is shown by an entry in the
Ellis	PERSON	-
Allan	PERSON	cash-book un - der date
December 28 , 1816	DATE	: '' pd Miss Du - bourg 's a/c for
Edgar	PERSON	-LSB- -RSB- 23-16-0 . ''

		There is a similar entry in the same volume under date
August 28 , 1817	DATE	, for `` Edgar 's School a/c -LSB- -RSB- 24-16-0 . ''

		; but whether this was paid to the Misses Dubourg or to Dr.
Bransby	PERSON	is not clear , though the fact that the amount specified tallies closely with that paid the Misses Dubourg in the preceding
December	DATE	would indicate that
Poe	PERSON	continued his stud - ies in
Sloane	PERSON	street down to the middle of
1817	DATE	.

		Not without interest also are several letters written by
John Allan	PERSON	in
1815	DATE	to his partner ,
Charles Ellis	PERSON	, in
Richmond	LOCATION	, in which mention is made of the boy
Poe	PERSON	.

		In a letter from
Liverpool	LOCATION	on
July 29 , 1815	DATE	, the day after his arrival in
England	LOCATION	,
Allan	PERSON	gives an account of his voyage across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and notes that although certain of his party were `` verry sick '' on the voyage ,
Edgar	PERSON	was only '' a little sick , and soon recovered . ''

		From
Greenock	PERSON	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, he wrote on
September 21	DATE	on the same subject : ``
Edgar	PERSON	says Pa : say some - thing for me say I was not afraid coming across the sea . ''

		In a letter from
London	LOCATION	written one
October	DATE	evening shortly after he went up to the city ,
Allan	PERSON	represents himself as seated , as he writes , before '' a snug fire in a nice little sitting parlour in No. 47 South - ampton Row , '' while `` Frances '' and `` Nancy '' -LRB- Mrs.
Allan	PERSON	and her sister -RRB- are sewing and
Edgar	PERSON	is `` reading a little Story Book . ''

		A letter of
May 18 , 1816	DATE	, from one of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's play - mates in
Richmond	LOCATION	,
C. M. Portiaux	PERSON	, conveys this message to the future poet : '' Give my love to
Edgar	PERSON	and tell him I want to see him very much .

		.

		I expect
Edgar	PERSON	does not know what to make of such a large City as
London	LOCATION	tell him
Josephine	PERSON	and all the children want to see him . ''

		Several entries in the office-books of
Charles Ellis	PERSON	serve to confirm certain tradi - tions as to
Poe	PERSON	's visit to
Richmond	LOCATION	in 1829-30 .

		Under date of
March 3 , 1829	DATE	,
John Allan	PERSON	is
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 145 charged with a bill of dry-goods sold `` p -LSB- er -RSB- I order to E A P , '' which authenticates the i tradition that
Poe	PERSON	returned to
Richmond	LOCATION	soon j after the death of the first Mrs.
Allan	PERSON	.

		, -LRB- Among the items in this bill are three yards J of black cloth at
twelve dollars	MONEY	a yard , three j pairs of black hose at four shillings per pair , j and one ``
London	LOCATION	Hat '' at ten dollars . -RRB-

		An - j other entry , under date of
January 8 , 1830	DATE	, ; proves that
Poe	PERSON	was again in
Richmond	LOCATION	early ' in the following year ; and an entry on
Janu	PERSON	- ary 28 of the same year indicates that he remained in
Richmond	LOCATION	on this visit for sev - !

		eral weeks .

		On
May 12 , 1830	DATE	,
Allan	PERSON	is charged with a bill of dry-goods , `` p -LSB- er -RSB- j
E. Poe	PERSON	, '' in which four blankets -LRB- evidently | intended for the poet 's use at West Point -RRB- i are the leading item .

		II .

		The most obscure period in the life of
Poe	PERSON	| is that of the two and a half years immedi - | ately following his expulsion from West i Point in
March , 1831	DATE	.

		That he went to
Balti	LOCATION	- i more shortly after leaving the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	is established by a letter that he wrote to a
Baltimore	LOCATION	editor ,
William Gwynn	PERSON	, on
May 6	DATE	, |
1831	DATE	.

		That he was living in
Baltimore	LOCATION	in the
autumn of 1833	DATE	is established by
John P. Kennedy	PERSON	's reminiscences of him in connection with his winning '' The
Baltimore	LOCATION	Visitor 's '' short-story prize in
October , 1833	DATE	.

		The evi - dence as to his whereabouts in the interven - ing years is conflicting .

		Mr.
Ingram	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	's English biographer , declares that the corre - spondence of Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	, aunt and mother - in-law of the poet , indicates that he did not live in
Baltimore	LOCATION	at this time .

		To like effect , also , as Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	points out , is the testimony of a
Baltimore	LOCATION	cousin and sweetheart .

		Miss
Elizabeth Herring	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the testimony of another
Baltimore	LOCATION	sweetheart , Miss
Mary Devereaux	PERSON	, and of an early friend ,
Lambert A. Wilmer	PERSON	, is to the effect that he did live in
Baltimore	LOCATION	most of this time .

		* * The reminiscences of Miss
Devereaux	PERSON	are embodied in an article contributed by
Augustus Van Cleef	PERSON	to ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly '' for
March , 1889	DATE	.

		Wilmer 's reminiscences were published in the ''
Baltimore	LOCATION	Commercial '' of
May 23 , 1866	DATE	, and in his volume , '' Our Press Gang . ''

		Miss
Devereaux	PERSON	's name is not mentioned by
Van Cleef	PERSON	, but it is given by
F. W. Thomas	PERSON	in his sketch of
Poe	PERSON	on the authority of a
Baltimore	LOCATION	acquaintance of his ,
James Tuhey	PERSON	-LRB- see
J. H. Wbitty	PERSON	, '' Poems of
Poe	PERSON	, '' p. xxxiv -RRB- , and the identification of the two is vir - tually established by the
Baltimore	LOCATION	directories for the early thirties .

		Miss
Devereaux	PERSON	asserts that she lived on Essex street -LRB- evidently a slip for
Exeter	LOCATION	street there was no Essex street in
Baltimore	LOCATION	-RRB- , next door to the home of her land - lord , a Mr.
Newman	PERSON	, and that Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	'' lived around the corner '' in a street that crossed her own .

		The
Baltimore	LOCATION	directory for
1831	DATE	-LRB- there was no issue for
1832	DATE	-RRB- represents the uncle of
Miss Devereaux	LOCATION	,
James Devereaux	PERSON	-LRB- with whom , apparently , she lived -RRB- , as making his home at 38
North Exeter	LOCATION	street , and reports at the same time that
Lawson Newman	PERSON	lived in
Exeter	LOCATION	street , near
Wilks	LOCATION	, and that
Mrs	PERSON	,
Clemm	PERSON	lived in Mechanic 's Row ,
Wilks	PERSON	street .

		Before
May , 1833	DATE	, accord - ing to the directory of that year , Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	had moved to Amity street , but
Newman	PERSON	still lived on
Exeter	LOCATION	street , and both
Newman	PERSON	and the
Devereaux	PERSON	family were living on
Exeter	LOCATION	street in 1835-6 .

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	takes the position in his revised life of
Poe	PERSON	that the testimony of Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	and of Miss Herring must give way before the more circumstantial accounts of Wilmer and
Miss Devereaux	LOCATION	, and he con - cludes that the evidence in the case justifies the assumption that
Poe	PERSON	was living in
Balti	LOCATION	- more throughout the period in question .

		An examination of the testimony of Wilmer and
Miss Devereaux	LOCATION	in the light of contemporary evidence not hitherto brought to bear on the case leads me to believe that Professor Wood - berry is correct , in the main , in the infer - ences that he draws from their testimony , but that he is mistaken in assuming that they connect
Poe	PERSON	with
Baltimore	LOCATION	for the entire period .

		The reminiscences of these two early acquaintances of the poet make it reasonably certain that
Poe	PERSON	lived in
Baltimore	LOCATION	from
May , 1831	DATE	, to the
autumn of 1832	DATE	; but in my judgment they do not prove that he lived in
Baltimore	LOCATION	during the following year .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	proceeds on the theory that the year of Wilmer 's association with
Poe	PERSON	when he saw the poet daily `` for weeks to - gether '' was
1833	DATE	.

		`` It is necessary , '' he asserts , `` to connect
Wilmer	PERSON	's recollections with the year
1833	DATE	, and especially with its latter part , when
Poe	PERSON	won the prize in the ` VisiterV competition . ''

		But notices of the `` Visiter '' in the ``
Baltimore	LOCATION	Chronicle '' of
January 6 , 1832	DATE	, and later dates , make it plain that
Wilmer	PERSON	's connection with the `` Visiter '' began in
January , 1832	DATE	, with the establishment of that paper ; and it termi - nated six or
eight months later	TIME	, as he tells us in his recollections , when , after a squabble with the proprietors of the paper , he brought suit against them in chancery .

		The
Balti	LOCATION	- more court records show that this suit was instituted on
August 10 , 1832	DATE	, and that , after a preliminary trial , it was transferred , on
September 29	DATE	, to the higher courts at
Annapo	LOCATION	- lis .

		It was settled soon afterward , and about the same time -LRB- in the `` chinkapin season , '' as Wilmer tells us , or before the end of
October	DATE	-RRB- he left
Baltimore	LOCATION	; and he was not closely associated with the poet again until
1834	DATE	or
1835	DATE	.

		The recollections of
Miss Devereaux	LOCATION	, which Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	associates with the years 1832-3 , relate , I believe , to the years 1831-2 .

		She declares that she first met the poet in the
summer	DATE	, shortly after his return from West Point , and that the period of her intimacy with him -LRB- when he called on her daily -RRB- lasted but a year `` from
summer	DATE	to summer . ''

		She associates in time the termination of their intercourse with an occasion apparently re - ferred to also by
Wilmer	PERSON	, that of an eve - 146 THE DIAL
Feb. 17	DATE	ning 's carousal on the part of the poet with some West Point comrades whom he had chanced to meet .

		It would seem , then , that the break between the two lovers came shortly before
Wilmer	PERSON	left
Baltimore	LOCATION	; and she states that she did not see the poet again until sev - eral years after his marriage .

		We are accordingly justified , I think , in concluding that
Poe	PERSON	made his home in
Balti	LOCATION	- more from the
spring of 1831	DATE	to the autumn of
1832	DATE	; but until further evidence is forth - coming , we can not be certain where he lived from the
autumn of 1832	DATE	to the autumn of
1833	DATE	.

		There is uncertainty also as to
Poe	PERSON	's activi - ties during these years .

		Mrs.
Weiss	PERSON	records a story to the effect that he was seen on one occasion during his early life in
Baltimore	LOCATION	at work in a brick-yard .


F. W. Thomas	PERSON	reports on the testimony , apparently , of another -LRB- see
Whitty	PERSON	's edition of the poems , p. xxxiv -RRB- that he wrote for the newspapers while in
Baltimore	LOCATION	; and according to the same author - ity he went on a voyage to
Ireland	LOCATION	at some time during this period .

		Wilmer states that when he knew him in
1832	DATE	he had already composed some of his stories .

		That his chief literary employment at this time was upon his stories is the view that now seems most plausi - ble , though he may also have had some irregu - lar newspaper connection .

		That he was at work on his stories then is established by the fact , which has escaped his biographers , that he published five of his tales in a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	weekly in the year
1832	DATE	.

		On
January 14 , 1832	DATE	, there appeared in the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	''
Saturday	DATE	Courier '' his story '' Metzengerstein . ''

		The same paper pub - lished on
March 3 , 1832	DATE	, his '' Due de 1 ` Ome - lette '' ; this was followed on
June 9	DATE	by `` A Tale of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	'' ; and on
November 10	DATE	by `` Loss of Breath '' -LRB- under the title `` A Decided Loss '' -RRB- ; and on
December 1	DATE	by `` Bon-Bon '' -LRB- under the title `` The Bargain Lost '' -RRB- .

		Each of these was published anony - mously , and each was to be republished , in revised form ,
several years later	DATE	in the '' Southern Literary Messenger . ''

		The ''
Courier	PERSON	'' was a weekly much after the order of the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post , '' its most important rival .

		It had been estab - / ished early in
1831	DATE	; and in its issue of
July 31 , 1831	DATE	, it had announced a short-story con - test , in which a prize of one hundred dollars was offered .

		It is probable that
Poe	PERSON	origi - nally submitted his tales in competition for this prize .

		According to the rules of the con - test , all stories submitted had to be in the hands of the proprietors by
December 1 , 1831	DATE	.

		The decision of the judges was announced in the `` Courier '' on
December 31 , 1831	DATE	: the prize of one hundred dollars was awarded to `` Miss
Delia S. Bacon	PERSON	, of the State of
New York	LOCATION	, author of ' The Tales of the Puritan / etc. , '' for her story `` Love 's Martyr . ''

		This story was printed in the '' Courier '' on Janu - ary 7 ,
1832	DATE	; and in the '' Courier '' of the fol - lowing week appeared '' Metzengerstein . ''

		The revelation that
Poe	PERSON	published some of his stories so early as
1832	DATE	makes it necessary to revise slightly the view heretofore held as to the time at which he began his short-story writing .

		His biographers have assumed that the earliest of his tales to find its way into print was the `` MS. Found in a Bottle , '' pub - lished in the ''
Baltimore	LOCATION	Visiter '' in
October , 1833	DATE	, and it has been supposed that he first became actively interested in the short story either in
1833	DATE	or in the preceding year .

		It now becomes plain that he began his career as a writer of stories not later than the au - tumn of
1831	DATE	.

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		THE NEW ACADEMY AWARDS , AND SOME OTHERS .

		ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LITERARY PRIZES .

		THE TOULOUSE FLORAL GAMES .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		This is the season in
France	LOCATION	for the award - ing of prizes by the great and small literary and scientific bodies all over the country ; and among the French , probably more than in any other nation , this custom flourishes .

		Next to the passion for honorific decorations , the thirst for being '' crowned '' or a '' lau - reate '' is most characteristic of this people .

		Every
summer	DATE	, at the end of the school year , the streets of
Paris	LOCATION	are thickly sprinkled with the children of the primary schools re - turning home with their proud parents , a wreath of artificial laurel around their young heads and a bundle of red-bound books under their arms ; while at `` the distribution of prizes '' of the high-schools and colleges , the grown-up boys and girls are ladened to profu - sion with medals and volumes of every size , subject , and value .

		Thus habituated from their earliest childhood to this prize-giving and prize-accepting practice , the fashion is observed by both parties concerned to the very end of life , medals and especially money being the award generally conferred on the adults of
France	LOCATION	.

		The book-trade is largely accountable for the flourishing of this usage , and is one of the principal gainers thereby .

		It profits in two - ways .

		In the first place , every well regu -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 147 lated French publishing house has a depart - ment of prize books ; and in the second place , authors with an itch for winning these dis - tinctions are only too prone to print their books beforehand in order to accomplish this object the better , or to print them afterwards when , as manuscripts , the honor has been at - tained .

		In fact , it is the few hundred francs thus acquired that generally serve to pay the printer 's bill .

		In either case this prize mania brings much grist to the publishing and print - ing mills of
France	LOCATION	.

		The most distinguished prize-dispenser in this land , and the one whose bounties and honors are the most sought after , is of course the French Academy .

		In fact , the annual ceremony in this connection is one of the chief events of the literary season of
Paris	LOCATION	, the principal number on the programme being the Report on the Competitions written and read by the Perpetual Secretary , who seizes the occasion to prepare a well-turned speech which is much enjoyed by the limited public crowded into the exiguous and old-fashioned auditorium which the venerable and conserva - tive
Academy	ORGANIZATION	persists in preserving as its home .

		Thus for the year just ended , it was
M. Etienne Lamy	PERSON	who held forth : and what he said , and said well , had a special interest just now , for both in
1914	DATE	and
1915	DATE	the lit - erary prizes of the French Academy were bestowed on the young writers killed in the service of their country .

		It was a touching ceremony , performed with all the taste and sentiment for which the French are distin - guished in functions of this kind .

		`` Among death 's victims , '' began the Per - petual Secretary , '' some die more than others .

		The most destroyed are those who contained in themselves the most of life : hence it is that the tenderest pity goes forth to the youngest of those who are no more .

		What life there was in those who sixteen months ago went forth from the colleges to the battle - field !

		These boys whom war transformed into men did not have time to make a name : their signatures are found only at the end of a thesis and they are signalized only because they are the sons of famous parents . ''

		And then the orator awarded prizes , which it was customary in the past to confer on gray - beards in literature , to lads who in some cases scarcely had shaved the down of boy - hood from their upper lip .

		Such are
Andre Michel	PERSON	, `` by right of birth devoted to art '' -LRB- his father is conservator of the
Louvre Museum	LOCATION	-RRB- ;
Charles Picard	PERSON	.

		`` son and grand - son of great mathematicians '' : Jean Mas - pero .

		`` formed by the master of the oldest history '' -LRB-
Gaston Maspero	PERSON	, the Egyptologist -RRB- ;
Lionel des Rieux	PERSON	, `` more famous perhaps as the grandson of
Chenier	PERSON	than for his ' Le Choeur des Muses ' '' ; and then he told us of
Allan Meeus	PERSON	, boy of twenty at
Saint Cyr	ORGANIZATION	, the AVest Point of
France	LOCATION	, when the war broke out , who was the class poet and who carried with him to the front in his haversack his first and only thin little volume of verse , `` Reves d' Amour et de Gloire '' `` how the title fits the age '' !

		and then he is awarded and what fitness here , too the
Francois Coppee Prize	ORGANIZATION	.

		And thus were hallowed the names of nearly eighty young French men of letters .

		M.
Emile Boutroux	PERSON	said to me after this memorable ceremony : '' In order to make it perfectly clear that the Academy wished to honor the supreme devotion i of these noble young men , joined to the money award was a gold medal with a proper inscription which will perpetuate the souvenir .

		But the Acad - ; emy had in mind not only the expression of the gratitude of the nation to those who have given their lives in order that the nation may remain free and great .

		Faithful to its mission to hold high the standard of letters , the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	seized this occasion to mark what , in its eyes , character - izes the veritable grandeur of the man of letters .

		Pascal has said that one is charmed when , expect - ing to find simply an author , one discovers in ad - dition a man , and
Vauvenargues	PERSON	has written this celebrated phrase : ' Grand thoughts come from the heart . '

		Such is the view taken by the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It does not look upon letters as simply \ a source of intellectual amusement , a more or less distinguished pastime .

		It holds that letters pene - trate life and reality , revealing what is most pro- found and best in the human soul , a power capable of lessening the woes of humanity and of lifting up the heart towards an ideal .

		Hence it is that the French Academy has found a peculiar attrac - tion in crowning these men of letters who have well served their country , seeing in them not only true patriots but writers who have fulfilled to the uttermost limit their role as men of letters by unit - ing the virtues of the man to the talents of the intellect . ''

		And the
Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, though by its nature further removed from the troubles of the hour , has not shown itself , in awarding its prizes during the past two years , wholly oblivious to the war .

		In
1914	DATE	it gave a prize of 15.000 francs to the military hospital opened by the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	in the former
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	mansion in the
Place St. Georges	LOCATION	, given to the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	some years ago by the historian 's family ; and at its recent annual Public Meeting , the retiring president ,
M. Edmond Perrier	PERSON	, the naturalist , conferred prizes on fifteen young scientists killed in battle .

		`` I know . ''

		he said , among other things , '' a grand scientific establishment ninety of whose mem - bers are at the front '' ; and
M. Camille Jordan	PERSON	, 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	the distinguished mining engineer , who suc - ceeded him as president for
1916	DATE	, was received by the audience with the warmest marks of sympathy when it was known that he had had his three sons killed in battle .

		But the prizes of this Academy are inter - esting for other than military reasons .

		Such is the Breant Prize of 100,000 francs , which awaits `` the person who finds the way of curing Asiatic cholera and who discovers the cause of this terrible curse . ''

		Another 100 , - 000 francs stands ready for '' the person who solves the problem of communicating with a star other than the planet Mars , '' and the donor adds with much good sense : '' Fore - seeing that this prize can not be given immedi - ately , the founder has expressed the wish that until then , the interest on the capital be employed every five years as a prize for a French or foreign scientist who has contrib - uted something of importance towards the progress of astronomy . ''

		The Osiris triennial prize is for the same amount of money and is on somewhat similar lines , '' for a discovery or very remarkable work in science , letters , arts , or industry , and in a general way , in everything of public interest . ''

		A less pre - tentious but very practical prize is that pro- vided by one of the female descendants of
Laplace	LOCATION	, a complete set of the great astrono - mer 's works for the young man who each year stands at the head of his class at the famous
Paris Polytechnic School	ORGANIZATION	, whose foun - dation was largely due to the efforts of
Laplace	LOCATION	.

		The widow of a certain other scien - tist displays less good taste when she pro- vides an annual prize '' for a young scientist whose work has been overlooked , '' on condi - tion that `` the recipient visits the tomb of her husband at
Montparnasse	LOCATION	cemetery the month following the award . ''

		The act of ''
John Sanf ord Saltus	PERSON	, a
New York	LOCATION	artist '' 1 copy this time from the official list of the Academy of Fine Arts does not seem to be very happy , either , for he offers '' an annual prize of a hundred dollars to the painter of a battle picture exhibited at the
Paris	LOCATION	Salon . ''

		The son of Henner improves on this , for he has arranged to have an annual sum of
9000	DATE	francs divided equally among three young men leaving the Academy of
France	LOCATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	and to be given to them during three years , until they get started in their artistic career .

		Often the prize is not only richly merited but very helpful , as was the case when the poor old entomologist , the late
J. H. Fabre	PERSON	, was awarded a
2000	DATE	franc prize ; and when
M. Gaillot	PERSON	, who is now over eighty and was one of
Leverrier	PERSON	's faithful assistants , was re - membered in a similar way , because he had promised the great astronomer , almost on his dying bed , that the tables of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	,
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	,
Neptune	LOCATION	, and Uranus would be carefully re - vised , and this great task
M. Gaillot	PERSON	has now accomplished .

		The French Academy grants certain awards for the promotion of music and dramatic arts which are also worthy of approval .

		Thus ,
M. Alfred Poizat	PERSON	, the author of '' Sophonisbe , '' and
M. Gustave Guiches	PERSON	, the author of `` Vouloir , '' both recently given at the Theatre francais , each received this year the Toirac Prize , which carried with it 4000 francs , while the
Emile Augier	PERSON	Prize of
5000	DATE	francs was awarded to Mile .


Marie Leneru	PERSON	for her '' Les Affranchis , '' given with success at the
Odeon	LOCATION	.

		This appetite for prizes comes out well in the history of the
Paris Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Societe des Gens de Lettres	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which was established in
1838	DATE	originally for the unique purpose of having a care for the copy - right interests of authors .

		But as early as
1852	DATE	the prevalent craving began to show it - self , when
Baron Tremont	PERSON	founded the first prize , and now at the end of each year the committee awards something like a score .

		During the past month a new one has been announced ; the talented artist ,
M. Henri Nocq	PERSON	, has just composed a medal to be named in honor of the late
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	, which
M. Georges Lecomte	PERSON	, the president , states `` will be distributed on very rare occasions . ''

		Speaking of the prize-giving by this society ,
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	said to me recently : '' Here the objections to the custom are more legiti - mate than in the case of the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, where , as a rule , the best writers of
France	LOCATION	sit as judges , whereas the committee of the
Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	is not chosen with this aim in view . ''

		A young writer ,
M. Florian-Parmentier	PERSON	, is still severer on this custom than is
M. Souday	PERSON	.

		In his recent book , `` Histoire Contemporaine des Lettres Franchises '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Figuiere , 5 francs -RRB- , a book which , by the way , should be in the hands of everyone who wishes to understand the complex literature of the
France	LOCATION	of to - day , he considers these prizes the equivalent of the old-time pensions , and condemns them because they are awarded to intriguing and begging candidates , and go even to writers who are rich .

		In a letter which I have just received from him written from the army , where he is a marechal des logis , he says : '' The
Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	has just given me a prize for my last book ! ''

		The exclama - tion mark is mine .

		But
M. Salomon Reinach	PERSON	takes issue with M. Florian-Parmentier : '' This is all nonsense .

		It may happen that a rich man writes a good book and gets a prize , but
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 149 nobody on the committee I have often served on them in my Academy of Inscriptions ever en - quires if a book is by a
Croesus	ORGANIZATION	or an Irus ; that concerns nobody .

		But a more serious objection to the system arises from the fact that the number of prizes in the French Academy is now so large that the members of the different committees can not possibly read all the books sent in ; so it hap - pens that some volumes get prizes because the author is said to be in great want , because the title seems serious , or because the work has been highly ' recommended . '

		Some fifteen years ago a Protestant paper in
Paris	LOCATION	complained because a goody-goody book had been given a prize , though it contained a panegyric of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	.

		I went and saw in the matter the then Perpetual Secretary ,
Boissier	PERSON	, whose ances - tors had been Protestants , and who told me that the report on that very book had been drawn up by
Ludovic Halevy	PERSON	, who was of Jewish descent , but who , being overwhelmed with books for prizes , ` had only just peeped into this one and had not read it through . '

		That may happen often enough .

		It does happen also that splendid original work , like that of
Loisy	LOCATION	, is not rewarded because relig - ious prejudice , still very strong in the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, objects to it .

		But judging things fairly , prizes are a very good institution .

		In the first place , they make it possible to reward very worthy writers whose books create no sensation and who need this support and this recommendation to the reading public .

		Again , these awards enable impecunious scholars to publish at their own expense learned works , which without this aid would bring them into debt .

		And in the matter of the ' virtue ' prizes , they bring honor and a little money to faithful children , nurses , and the like , who have nothing to expect elsewhere of a pecuniary nature .

		The great enemies of the prize system are those who do not get them , either because their work is bad or because it is too good and is in advance of the times . ''

		Nor does
M. Gustave Geffroy	PERSON	, President of the
Goncourt Academy	ORGANIZATION	, disapprove of the cus - tom , at least in so far as his body is con - cerned . ''

		I consider the Goncourt Prize , '' he once wrote to me , '' very useful in vivifying the love of letters , now more than ever essen - tial to civilization .

		And then I may say that our literary group is absolutely independent . ''

		But
M. Paul Margueritte	PERSON	, also of the Gon - eourt Academy , is , as I know , a little more critical of the custom : `` Personally I am not very favorable ; but yet we should not overlook the difficulties which writers encounter at the start , the almost total absence to-day of any really sound literary criticism , and the venality of the press .

		Nor should we forget that the Goncourt Prize 5,000 francs each year to some young writer of talent , a novelist by pref - erence becomes a real advertisement for him and his book .

		Again , it should be noted that this prize has not given ground for the objections which might have been feared , the imitation of a genre and the danger that candidates might adopt a manner that would render them surer of securing the coveted honor .

		The astonishing variety of the books which have won the
Goncourt Prize	ORGANIZATION	proves the correctness of my statement . ''

		It seems that the origin of this institution I refer now more to the literary prizes is to be found in the so-called Floral Games established in
Toulouse	LOCATION	more than a century before
America	LOCATION	was discovered ; while for the virtue prizes , I suppose Baron de Montyon -LRB- 1733-1820 -RRB- may be considered their author .

		Each year the
Toulouse Academy	ORGANIZATION	celebrates its traditional Fete des Fleurs , the poetic name given to the ceremony organized by the equally poetically named Academic des
Jeux Floreaux	PERSON	.

		The event is a mixture of litera - ture , sentiment , and religion .

		The day opens with a eulogy of
Clemence Isaure	PERSON	, that noble dame of
Toulouse	LOCATION	who has a more or less mythical existence far back in the fifteenth century , and who is believed to have re - founded the Floral Games , though ruthless modern criticism has tried to play havoc with this , as with so many other charming legends .

		But in spite of the learned doctors , the Acad - emy very sensibly continues the pretty wonts of the past .

		Thus , after the delivery of the eulogy , a committee of academicians goes to fetch the gold and silver flowers which have been exhibited since early morning on the chief altar of
Notre-Dame la Daurade	ORGANIZATION	, where , according to tradition ,
Clemence Isaure	PERSON	lies buried .

		During the absence of this commit - tee , the report on the year 's competitions is read ; and on the arrival of the flowers , the awards are made .

		The quality of the flowers is quite in keeping with the good taste of the whole performance .

		Thus , the gold violet is valued at 750 francs , and the one in silver at 250 ; the gold eglantine , 450 francs , and the amaranth , 400 .

		And the meaning of the flowers is accentuated by the rule of the Academy that the exchange of a flower for its money value is not a right enjoyed by the successful candidates ; and when it is granted , the laureate may receive in specie only four - fifths of the real value of the flower .

		The wide popularity of these
Toulouse	LOCATION	prize con - tests is shown by the fact that in the recent one for French poetry , the Academy , the Perpetual Secretary informs me , received 70 odes , 77 ordinary poems , 15 epistles , 2 rhymed discourses , 4 eclogues , 17 idyls , 31 elegies , 18 ballads , 14 fables , 46 sonnets and 12 hymns in honor of the
Virgin	ORGANIZATION	, 277 irregular sonnets , 58 poems on aviation , and 277 miscellaneous poems , over 900 in all !

		But the labor of the
Toulouse	LOCATION	academicians is much lessened by the rule that '' no poem may contain more than two hundred lines . ''

		150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	The
Toulouse	LOCATION	competitions in langue d'oc are particularly interesting , there in the old home of the Troubadours .

		Of course the number of the competitors is much smaller and their learning on a higher level than is generally the case with the candidates for the ordinary literary prizes .

		At the last contest , 126 persons took part , and among those who won flowers were three college professors , one from
Cyrano	LOCATION	's town ,
Bergerac	LOCATION	, and one a priest from the Cantal .

		The official circular of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	thus defines the langue d'oc of to-day : '' The romance language of
Upper Languedoc	LOCATION	and its environs ,
Lengo Moundino	LOCATION	, with its diverse variants , of which the Tou - louse dialect will be considered as the type in the decisions of the Academy . ''

		The competi - tors are requested to accompany their manu - scripts with a translation in French , to state which dialect they make use of , and to put at the top of their manuscripts the name of their commune , canton , and department .

		So Jas - min , who died over
a half century ago	DATE	, might still exclaim , likening his dear patois to a mother , with the grace and fire which made him famous , if he could speak from the top of his monument in his picturesque old Agen : '' De sabens francimans , La coundannon a mort dezumpey tres-cens ans ; Tapla biou saquela ; tapla sous mots brounzinon ; Chez elo , las sazous passon , sonon , tindinon ; Et cent-milo-miles enquero y passaran , Sounaran et tindinaran ! ''

		THEODORE
STANTON	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
Jan. 20 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		KINDLY HUMOR AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF CULTURE in its highest sense has often received the praise it so richly deserves ; and now , inciden - tally , in an article on '' The German Mind '' published in '' The Hibbert Journal '' for the current quarter , Professor
George Trumbull Ladd	PERSON	says another good word for it .

		The con - nection in which it is uttered may perhaps be held to disqualify it for quotation on the part of a judicious editor of a purely literary journal ; but this difficulty may be obviated by inviting the reader to transpose or other - wise change at will the national designations used by the writer .

		It is the general princi - ple , not its specific illustration , that here solicits approval .

		Professor
Ladd	PERSON	writes : '' It is no new discovery in literary criticism that the comic thought of modern
Germany	LOCATION	, whether expressed in words or in pictorial form , is for the most part devoid of the deli - cacy of the French and the kindliness of the English .

		But , to quote a fine characterisa - tion from a modern English writer : ` Your sense of humour , that delicate percipience of proportion , that subrident check on impulse , that touch of the divine fellowship , is a thing of mellower growth .

		It is a solvent and not an excitant .

		It does not stimulate to sublime effort ; but it can cool raging passion .

		It can take the salt from tears , the bitterness from judgment , the keenness from despair . '

		That the typical Prussian is capable of being stimu - lated to ' sublime effort , ' and of accomplishing many praiseworthy and glorious deeds , the history of
Prussia	LOCATION	through all its past , and the history which is to-day being made by a
Prussianized Germany	LOCATION	, evinces abundantly .

		At the same time there is less and less evi - dence , whether in words or in conduct , of that delicate ` percipience of proportion , that sub - rident check on impulse , that touch of the divine fellowship ' with human frailty , which result from ` the mellower growth ' of the sense of humour . ''

		A good and expressive term , whether in respect to literary work or painting or sculpture or other form of crea - tive art , or in reference to the art that is above all these , the art of daily conduct , is '' artistic detachment '' ; and this detachment implies something of that genial humor , that freedom from passion , that conquest of selfish emotions , which Professor
Ladd	PERSON	evidently has in mind in the foregoing passage .

		THE SHORT LIFE OF A LIBRARY BUILDING short as compared with the builders ' confident expectation of many decades of usefulness for their imposing structure is a thing of fre - quent remark .

		If the building does not have to give place to a larger within a dozen or at most a score of years , it commonly needs enlargement and modernizing , so rapid is the increase in its patronage and so constant the development of new processes and appliances and activities .

		It seems but yesterday , as the phrase goes , that the present writer was escorted over the
Amherst College Library	ORGANIZATION	building and invited to admire its modern system of book-stacks -LRB- by no means filled with books -RRB- and other equipments , all up to the minute in newness and unsurpassability .

		Yet that building has now long been the despair of its users because of its inadequacy its hopeless state of congestion and its increas - ing inability to meet the demands made upon
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151 it .

		Great , therefore , is the rejoicing at this
New England	LOCATION	college over the recent an - nouncement of a quarter-million gift from some source for a new structure .

		Work on the plans of such a building was started some time ago , in anticipation of an early answer to
Amherst	LOCATION	's prayers , so that the operations of carpenter and mason can begin with little delay .

		But who would dare to prophesy that even those of us who are no longer young will not live to hear a renewed clamor from the
Deerfield	LOCATION	valley for a new library building where , not so very long ago , Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	was in proud control of the very latest thing in bibliothecal architecture and equipment ?

		RESUSCITATING A DEAD LANGUAGE may fairly be reckoned a desperate undertaking .

		To have life and spontaneity , speech must be acquired with little or no conscious effort .

		Any attempt to revive the
Cornish	LOCATION	, for ex - ample , or other extinct Celtic dialect , though a praiseworthy enterprise from a philological viewpoint , can not be expected to accomplish great results .

		But the very difficulty of such undertakings must add to their attractiveness for those whose mission it is to lead forlorn hopes .

		Every once in a while the assertion is hazarded that Latin is not a dead language , and elaborate proof is offered of its present - day vitality .

		For instance , a few weeks ago the Czar of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	greeted the
Kaiser	PERSON	of
Germany	LOCATION	at
Nish	ORGANIZATION	in a ceremonious address , all in
Latin	LOCATION	; and the world was called upon to recognize and appreciate the propriety of this choice of the tongue of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	and
Cicero	PERSON	on the site of the old Roman fortress of
Nissa	ORGANIZATION	.

		A neutral language was required , and the dig - nified and sonorous Latin answered the need .

		In our own country , in the city of
New York	LOCATION	, there is a
Societas Gentium Latina	ORGANIZATION	, its moving spirit Dr.
Arcadius Avellanus	PERSON	, who learned the language colloquially as a boy in Hun - gary , and its president Dr.
Herbert C. de V. Cornwell	PERSON	, who believes Latin to be the most perfect speech ever spoken by tongue of man .

		There is a
Latin Printing Press Company	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and from it have come works of modern literature in ancient dress .

		Dr.
Avellanus	PERSON	, again , is the leader in this move - ment to make Latin as easy and delightful to learn as French or Italian or Spanish .

		In recent years he has had an enthusiastic and munificent patron in Mr.
E. Parmalee Pren	PERSON	- tice , originator and publisher of the `` Mount Hope Classics . ''

		volume three of which is noticed more at length on another page .

		Mr.
Prentice	PERSON	's intelligent activity in the so-called
Amherst	LOCATION	movement for the promotion of classical studies is well known .

		Some vears ago a famous English schoolmaster visited this country to demonstrate the success of his system of training pupils in Latin by the con - versational method ; and he made a highly favorable impression .

		These and other zeal - ous attempts to preserve and perpetuate some - thing of what has been considered the best in a liberal education are deserving of warm praise and hearty encouragement .

		A VAST STOREHOUSE OF POETRY , in the '' new '' manner , is contained in the country 's commercial and journalistic records .

		Here is a field overflowing with unsuspected -LRB- and un - suspecting -RRB- bards , a garden of poesy so boundless and luxuriant that the future an - thologist may well despair when he comes to cull his bouquet of blossoms from its confines .

		As examples of the treasure trove existent in this hitherto unworked mine of vers libre , the following lyrics have lately been offered : I. '' Railroad stocks More than held
Yesterday	DATE	's gains At the opening
this morning	TIME	, 3,000 shares of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, for example , Appearing on the tape At an advance Of li/i points . ''

		II . ''

		Children Under five years of age `` Will be carried free When accompanied by parent Or guardian : Five years of age and under twelve , Half fare ; Twelve years of age Or over , Full fare . ''

		TWO WAYS TO INDUCE A LOVE OF THE BEST BOOKS are recognized in
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, as elsewhere ; but the two methods are at va - riance and have each its separate advocates .

		The public librarian of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, writes in the course of her annual report of progress at the institution over which she presides : '' There are two opinions among teachers and also among librarians regarding the methods to be used in developing a love for good literature .

		One group holds that the ' working up ' book is essential and that it must be within easy reach of the student .

		The other group believes that standards are set only by contact with the best , and that the mediocre book is overestimated and should be used as ` bait ' only with the most difficult cases . ''

		The
Portland	LOCATION	authorities have adopted the heroic course of interdicting the second-rate and the commonplace in their 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	ordering of the young people 's reading .

		Sta - tistics of circulation are expected to suffer , but what of that ?

		What will it profit a boy if he get ecstasies of delight from ''
Nick Car	PERSON	- ter '' and lose his capacity to enjoy
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and Shakespeare ?

		`` Literature teach - ers , '' says the high-minded librarian already quoted , `` are said to be the devoted cham - pions of a lost cause ; the high-school libra - rians should share in the battle and help to sustain their faith in the capacity of their pupils to enjoy the best things . ''

		The `` work - ing up '' method would win more confidence if it were not for the hundreds of thousands who are started so promisingly on that ascend - ing ladder , but never get higher than the lowest rung or two .

		OUR COPYRIGHT BUSINESS shows a rapid in - crease since the reorganization of the office in
1897	DATE	.

		In the current Report of the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	the Register of Copyrights an - nounces that the yearly fees received in his office have more than doubled since
1897	DATE	, passing the hundred-thousand-dollar mark in the fiscal year following the passage of the new copyright law , which took effect
July 1 , 1909	DATE	, and amounting to nearly one hundred and twelve thousand dollars in the last fiscal year .

		This means , of course , a corresponding increase in the total number of books and other items copyrighted .

		In the twelve months end - ing
June 30 , 1914	DATE	, 20,296 volumes printed in this country were copyrighted ; also
1894	DATE	vol - umes that were printed abroad in a foreign language ; 25,696 pamphlets , leaflets , etc. ; 49,696 numbers of periodicals ; 40,437 musical compositions ; and
6596	DATE	motion-picture pho - toplays .

		The last-named productions have increased in number very rapidly since the first entry of 160 in the records of 1912-13 .

		On the other hand , musical and dramatic com - positions and foreign books have greatly fallen off of late , the decline in both instances being probably attributable to the same de - plorable cause , the great war .

		English works registered for `` ad interim copyright '' also show a considerable and easily intelligible decrease , as do also works of art and repro - ductions of such works .

		The encouraging fea - ture in the whole display is the uninterrupted growth of our domestic literary activity .

		A GIFTED BOOKMAN , and most generous in the use he made of his gifts , was the late
Edward Tiffany	PERSON	, who died recently at nearly ninety years of age after a life largely devoted to lit - erature and to library work , but who left behind him nothing in printed form to pre - serve his name from quick oblivion ; and , indeed , that name will be looked for in vain in the handbooks of contemporary biography to which one naturally turns in any attempt to write his fitting obituary .

		But from one who knew him well it is learned that Mr.
Tiffany	PERSON	was the son of
Osmond Tiffany	ORGANIZATION	, of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, a merchant and manufacturer , whose fortune was lost in the panic of
1873	DATE	.

		Edward , thrown upon his own resources in middle life by this family disaster , found his true vocation in books .

		After some years of library service in his native city he was called to the
Boston Pub	ORGANIZATION	-
lic Library	ORGANIZATION	, where for a generation he placed his wide knowledge of literature at the service of all who chose to consult him .

		Unlike the typical bookman , he cared nothing for first editions or other similar rarities .

		To him the outside of a book , its mere form or age or cost - liness , .

		meant nothing ; but with the matter that books contained he had an astonishingly intimate acquaintance .

		All branches of polite literature and even some departments of the literature of science were familiar to him , and he was exceptionally well versed in music and the drama .

		Such was the modest gentleman who placed thousands in his debt during his long connection with one of our foremost pub - lic libraries ; and a more than perfunctory tribute of respect is due him in reviewing , however inadequately , the main facts of his long and useful life .

		A NOTABLE DIARY , recently acquired by the Division of Manuscripts of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and described by Dr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	, Chief of that Division , in the latest Report of the Librarian , is a voluminous composition -LRB- 25 volumes -RRB- from the pen of
Edmund Ruffin	PERSON	, and covers the ten years , 1856-1865 .

		Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	says of
Ruffin	PERSON	and his diary : '' He was a man of a high order of talent , a successful scientific farmer on a large scale , an author especially on agricultural subjects a slaveholder , and a firm believer in the economic system of the South .

		He was an intense believer in state rights , and was selected to fire the first gun against
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	,
April 12 , 1861	DATE	-LRB- he being then a mem - ber of a
South Carolina	LOCATION	regiment -RRB- .

		He kept a voluminous diary during the whole period of the Civil War , giving the march of events and his own views upon them , from day to day .

		It presents faithfully his extreme point of view and is a document of peculiar value .

		At the close of the War , on
June 18 , 1865	DATE	, being then 71 years of age , poor , and infirm in health , and not wishing to live under the government which had conquered his state , he committed suicide .

		The last entry in his diary was made on the day of this tragic
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 153 event . ''

		An abridged edition of this diary ought to be worth publishing as a book of rather unusual historical if not also romantic and pathetic interest .

		PROHIBITIONS FOR POETS are formulated , to the number of sixteen , by Mr.
Arthur Guiter	PERSON	- man and printed in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		Of these negative injunctions , all beginning with `` Do n't , '' and all uttered in the interest of poets whom material considerations do not allow to cultivate poetry merely for pleasure , the following are especially noteworthy : '' Do n't think of yourself as a poet , and do n't dress for the part ... Do n't call your quar - ters a garret or a studio .

		Do n't frequent ex - clusively the company of writers .

		Do n't think of any class of work that you feel moved to do as either beneath you or above you .

		Do n't complain of lack of appreciation ... Do n't speak of poetic license or believe that there is any such thing .

		Do n't tolerate in your own work any flaws in rhythm , rhyme , melody , or grammar .

		Do n't use ` e'er ' for ` ever , ' ` whenas ' or ` what time ' for ` when , ' or any of the ` poetical ' commonplaces of the past .

		.

		.

		Do n't omit articles or prepositions for the j sake of the rhythm .

		Do n't have your book | published at your own expense by any house that makes a practice of publishing at the author 's expense ... Do n't , do n't write hymns to the Great God Pan .

		He is dead , let him rest in peace . ''

		THE POCOMOKE WAY of securing the bless - ings of good literature for smaller communi - ties has its admirable features .

		At
Pocomoke City	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, the public library has no building of its own , nor any very large collec - tion of books to require such a building .

		It received the offer of the disused
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Railroad station , but could obtain no suitable site - for the building , and consequently was j forced to refuse it .

		Its quarters , rent-free and provided with heat and light , are in the so-called Fireman 's Building .

		Not long ago .

		as we read in the
Maryland Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	's Biennial Report , `` a play was given by the children of the town under a professional trainer .

		They cleared
$ 40.00	MONEY	.

		i With this fund two Crex rugs , a reading !

		table , three straight-back chairs , a wicker | rocker , and 97 new books were purchased . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his defence of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's '' solid work '' on the Bacon-Shakespeare question -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Jan.	DATE	.

		20 ,
1916	DATE	-RRB- , Mr.
E. B. Lupton	PERSON	reminds your read - ers , with the usual Baconian disregard for truth , that I corrected Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	`` on one or two minor points '' regarding Shakespeare 's applica - tion for a coat-of-arms .

		As a matter of fact , I showed that Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	knew nothing about the subject , had not investigated the matter , and had contented himself with reproducing and distorting a part of Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's absurd account of the transaction .

		I made no pretence to proving my `` hero 's claim to the authorship of the plays . ''

		Shakespeare 's title is in no danger , and needs no defence .

		The Baconians , and other anti-WiUians , assuming that a man who did anything so dis - honorable as to conspire to be made a '' gentleman , '' could not have written great poetry , always cite the Shakespeare application for a coat-of-arms and put the most discreditable interpretation on the incomplete data available to us , thinking thereby to prove that he could not have been the author of '' Hamlet , '' ''
Lear	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		By disproving their calumnies I destroy the prop on which they build their edifice .

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	is not telling the truth when he says that none of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries , `` with possibly one exception , identifies the author -LSB- Shakespeare -RSB- with the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor , and this possible exception is by no means a clear excep - tion . ''

		He refers to
John Davies	PERSON	's poem in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is spoken of as '' our English Ter - ence , '' and says that if the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	then
Davies	PERSON	's allusion `` suggests a pseudonym . ''

		This , then , proves nothing , and may be equivocal .

		It is amazing what wizardry an `` if '' exerts upon a Baconian .

		But has Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	forgotten
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's wholly unequivocal identification of Shakespeare with
Stratford	LOCATION	?

		And has he overlooked the testimony of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's monument in
Stratford	LOCATION	?

		And
Leonard Digges	PERSON	's poetic reference in the first col - lected edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works -LRB- 1623 -RRB- to the poet 's '' Stratford monument '' ?

		I will concede to Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	that a stringing together of a -LRB- large -RRB- number of passages in praise of
George Eliot	PERSON	's works would lead us to the con - clusion that `` the author of the novels must have been a man of that name . ''

		But only in the absence of evidence to the contrary .

		But in Shake - speare 's case there is not a particle of evidence to the contrary , and therefore absolutely no sane rea - son for doubting his authorship .

		Besides , the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	allusions speak of the man as well as of his works .

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	is at his best when he maintains that Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	'' unwittingly proved conclusively that the actor -LSB- Shakespeare -RSB- was unable to write , be - cause his name -LSB- in the Bellott-Mountjoy affidavit -RSB- is written by a law clerk in law script , and the deponent -LSB- Shakespeare -RSB- made his mark beneath 154 THE DIAL
Feb. 17	DATE	this signature . ''

		No human being outside of a lunatic asylum , or a fit candidate for one , who has ever seen a facsimile of the deposition and the wit - ness 's signature can for a single moment entertain the belief that the abbreviated signature was writ - ten by the clerk who wrote the deposition .

		No sane person who knows anything of graphiology can for a moment doubt that the signature in ques - tion is an unquestioned Shakespeare autograph ; and that the deposition as well as the signa - ture are in the hand-writing that was in general use at the time .

		Has Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	mistaken the lex scripta for '' law script '' ?

		Furthermore , what Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	calls a '' mark '' beneath the signature is only a small blot .

		Had the witness not been able to sign his name , the clerk would have written the name , and would have written the words '' his mark '' between the Christian name and the sur - name , in accordance with general usage .

		I wish to assure Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	that I am not at all displeased with the Baconians for distinguishing between '' Shakspere '' and '' Shakespeare . ''

		I have yet to see any evidence that '' Shakespeare '' was a pseudonym .

		As to Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	's confident assertion that '' Shakspere '' and '' Shakespeare '' are essentially different names , I venture to say that his confidence is probably in inverse propor - tion to his knowledge of the subject .

		Miss
Porter	PERSON	's defence -LRB- also contained in your issue of
January 20	DATE	-RRB- of what may be regarded as the current interpretation of Coriolanus 's failure to recollect the name of the '' poor man '' in whose home he had found a lodging and whose kindness he wished to reward by saving him from possibly being sold to slavery confirms me in my own inter - pretation of the incident -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Dec. 23 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- .

		I can not agree with
Miss Porter	PERSON	when she says that '' to make Coriolanus forget the name .

		.

		is one of those multitudinous trifles of invention that speak eloquently of the characterizing and humanizing genius of Shakespeare . '' ''

		To forget the name while remembering the deed of a benefac - tor at a time when most men would be full only of themselves '' does not strike me as one of the char - acteristics of the human soul .

		Coriolanus would have been just as human had he remembered the name or succeeded in recollecting it .

		We must not lose sight of the fact that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	departs from Plutarch in introducing the hero 's lapse of memory .

		The poor man 's freedom , we fear , was not very dear to Coriolanus , who was probably more solicitous about the effect his display of mag - nanimity and freedom from sordidness made upon the many there assembled .

		Miss
Porter	PERSON	points out that Shakespeare 's '' cun - ning '' kept back until now the f aintness mentioned by
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	earlier .

		This is quite true , but there is absolutely nothing in the scene to show that any - body noticed any evidence of faintness or weakness in Coriolanus until he himself mentions it as an excuse a poor excuse is better than none for having forgotten his benefactor 's name .

		Our hero 's words and actions are quite lusty throughout .

		In Plutarch it was '' the Komans '' who noticed that he was '' faint with the great wounds he had upon him . ''

		I am not sure that I understand Miss
Porter	PERSON	's assertion that Coriolanus '' forgot because his very capacity to remember within his wounded head was faint for loss of blood . ''

		Scalp wounds do not affect the memory more than wounds of other parts of the body .

		Nor does a hemorrhage from the scalp or elsewhere conduce to the forgetting of men 's names more than of men 's actions .


Corio	PERSON	- lanus 's memory seems to have suffered no impair - ment as to other , and less essential , details . ''

		The blood has ceased to flow , is drying , a token of its exhaustion implying the need of care and nourishment . ''

		I can hardly believe that Miss Por - ter has so completely forgotten her physiology .

		The clotting of blood is not a token of its exhaus - tion , and this fact can not therefore be adduced as evidence of Coriolanus 's enfeeblement to the point of forgetting men 's names .

		Cominius 's remark '' The blood upon your visage dries ; ' t is time It should be look 'd to '' which Miss
Porter	PERSON	mis - interpreted , means no more than that it is a long time since Coriolanus 's wounds had been inflicted and that they ought to receive a surgeon 's attention .

		His words do not , therefore , '' reinforce the ex - planation '' offered by Coriolanus .

		Miss
Porter	PERSON	, I regret to say , has wholly misun - derstood my communication , and has consequently woefully misrepresented my views .

		She attributes to me the utterly untenable statement that ''
Corio	PERSON	- lanus forgot -LSB- the name -RSB- .

		.

		because he scorned to remember -LSB- it -RSB- . ''

		I did not say this , or imply it .

		To scorn something is a conscious act ; whereas Coriolanus 's lapse of memory , as I tried to show r was unconsciously determined .

		He himself did not know why he could not recall the name , and was as much surprised as chagrined at his forgetting .

		This does away with
Miss Porter	PERSON	's strictures about '' the sincerity of the scene and the characters . ''

		We are asked , too , by your correspondent to remember that Shakespeare '' prepared earlier for a special loss of blood in the head .

		This dauntless hero took his wounds headlong , confronting the foe . ''

		Does this mean that Coriolanus butted the Volscians with his head and thus received his in - juries ?

		There is absolutely no warrant for
Miss Porter	PERSON	's diagnosis of '' loss of blood in the head . ''

		A cerebral or intracranial hemorrhage would have rendered our hero unconscious on the battle-field , and would have made his appearance and his robustious oratory so shortly thereafter wholly impossible .

		To an Elizabethan audience the fact that the Volscian was described as '' poor '' would have been sufficient indication that he was a plebeian .

		That he was '' noble of nature '' is Miss
Porter	PERSON	's assump - tion ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	says nothing about it , although
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	does describe the man as '' honest . ''

		Would Shakespeare have troubled to introduce so slight , so unobtrusive , so subtle a touch into the portraiture of so striking a character as
Corio	PERSON	- lanus ?

		That he would is proved by the fact that he did so .

		He did not avoid perhaps could not help introducing slips of the tongue and other similar touches into his dramatic compositions .

		His
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 155 own unconscious insight into the minds of men made him do these things .

		He probably never stopped to think that some of his finest touches would escape his audiences and his readers , oh , yes !

		he had readers in mind , many of whom to this day look upon him through the very common - sense spectacles of
Peter Bell	PERSON	, to whom a primrose was a yellow primrose and nothing more .


SAMUEL A. TAXXEXBAUM	PERSON	,
M.D. Xew York	PERSON	,
Feb. 5 , 1916	DATE	.

		LOXGFELLOW AND MENDELSSOHN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Pray let a humble Bostonian thank Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	for his eminently sensible defence of
Longfellow	LOCATION	and , incidentally , of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have often , in the same way , compared
Longfellow	PERSON	and Men - delssohn ; the parallel is almost perfect .

		I should not have mentioned the ''
Elijah	PERSON	, '' for I agree with many of the critics that it is more nearly fustian than anything else that
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	composed .

		But the ''
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	'' holds its own perfect as a statue by Phidias as the purest , heavenliest of all oratorios .

		Not long ago an artist was at my house , and was combatting my dictum that the poet and the com - poser were each equally suffering from a tem - porary eclipse or obscuration .

		I got down the '' Kiverside Edition '' of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's poems and read to him some of the sonnets , beginning with those relating to
Dante	LOCATION	; and I waxed as eloquent as my limited vocabulary would permit over their perfect form , their exquisite melody , their splendid climaxes . ''

		You have converted me . ''

		he said , and he carried off with him that charming little book enshrining all
Longfellow	LOCATION	's sonnets . ''

		The Psalm of Life '' has become banal , perhaps , through too much familiarity and too many paro - dies ; but if one has the imagination to put oneself back into the early day when it first appeared , one can feel something of the thrill which it caused , and one can understand why it was a trumpet-call to the youth of that period .

		Almost all poetry consists of a certain amount of wood-pulp , and when the vital sap dries up to a greater or less extent one can discover why it is that the collected works of popular contempora - neous writers are allowed to collect dust on the shelves while only a line or two or a single stanza satisfies our own demand or finds its place in the dictionaries of quotations .

		But there is a good deal of sweet juicy poesy still mellowing the work of
Longfellow	LOCATION	. ''

		The Children 's Hour '' and a dozen others of his lyrics are simple , sincere , and melo - dious .

		Mr.
W. S. Braithwaite	PERSON	, in his review and ap - praisement of the poetry of the year
1914	DATE	, denied that the six American poets
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		Longfellow ,
Holmes	PERSON	, and
Lowell	PERSON	gen - erally regarded as '' great '' deserve that epithet .

		They are good poets , he said , but not great ; and he proceeded to instance
Poe	PERSON	, Whitman ,
Lanier	PERSON	,
Moody	ORGANIZATION	,
Hovey	PERSON	, and
Miss Anna Branch	ORGANIZATION	as really great .

		I sent a letter of protest to '' Poetry : A
Magazine of Verse	ORGANIZATION	, '' which Miss
Monroe	PERSON	returned with the declaration that
Poe	PERSON	stood a hundred or a thousand times higher than
Longfellow	LOCATION	!

		-LRB- We know how she regards
Bryant	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Comparisons are odorous , and it little profits to make such distinc - tions .

		Poe 's influence on French literature de - serves a special essay ; but
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's lyric in which occur the memorable lines '' The glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	And the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	'' is marred by the most banal run-on line -LRB- ending with '' which '' to rhyme with '' window-niche '' -RRB- to be found anywhere .

		A careful study of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verse surprises one by the mediocrity of its aver - age , and by the limited number of really poetical lines .

		He wrote no sonnet to be compared to any one of fifty from among
Longfellow	LOCATION	's , I can say all this with a clean conscience , for I delight in the vers libre of
Gustave Kahn	PERSON	, the founder of the new movement in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- why is he studiously neglected by Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	? -RRB-

		and that iconoclastic school , and I am not averse to
Marinetti	PERSON	's '' parole libere , '' that is , I am not so bigoted an upholder of the Parnassians as to be disgusted with the vagaries of the Cavort icists when , as is occasionally the case , they strike a genuine spark of vivid light from their steel .

		If there is any gold in the quartz it behooves us to extract it .

		In the same way , while I still get delight from Mendelssohn the '' Songs without Words , '' the Scotch or Italian Symphonies , the '' Hebrides Over - ture , '' and a dozen other perfectly balanced and melodious compositions , and from
Porpora	LOCATION	and
Bach	PERSON	and dear old Haydn , this does not preclude me from waxing enthusiastic over the splendid richness of
Strauss	PERSON	and the frequently cacophonous originalities of
Schoenberg	PERSON	and the high-colored magnificence of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	.

		While I would applaud every new thing , I hope I am broad enough to desire also a movement to '' mediterraneanize '' music once more to come back to the melodious - ness of the early men , when a dozen composers frankly vitalized simple melodies such as any per - son on the street might catch and whistle , even if the critic could not tell whether it was the work of one man or another .

		Monet and Manet and other Impressionists taught us to see colors to which our eyes were blind ; and yet the paintings of the academic school may still give us pleasure , if we have eyes to see .

		So , as Mrs.
Josephine Peabody Marks	PERSON	said in her admirable address at the annual dinner of the
American Poetry Society	ORGANIZATION	in
January	DATE	, there should be no reason why the advocates of '' the new verse '' should be narrow-minded and not allow the poets who prefer the old forms to practice them ; nor , on the other hand , should the classicists take as a per - sonal affront the experiments of self-styled re - formers .

		Let us ride
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, who , as Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	remarked , had four legs and four wings , if we want to do so .

		If others choose a whirring motor aeroplane and stun us with its noise , perhaps they too will reach the top of
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	even more quickly .

		It is a big little world , and there is room for all .

		So hail to
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Mendelssohn !	ORGANIZATION

		156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	SOME NOTES PROM JAPAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Those who read the paragraph in one of the mid -
summer	DATE	issues of THE DIAL about an immense Japanese dictionary will be interested in the fol - lowing paragraph on Dr.
Modzume	PERSON	and his under - taking , which appeared not long ago in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Advertiser '' : '' It looked for a time as though the thirty years ' work of Dr.
Modzume	PERSON	, who has been working all that time on the compilation of a Japanese dictionary , was to go for nothing , but through the generosity of a friend his dictionary is to be published after all .

		While working on his book , Dr.
Modzume	PERSON	spent all his fortune for the purchase of reference books and other expenses .

		He was in debt about
30,000 yen	MONEY	.

		As the time of publication drew near , his copy was distrained by creditors .

		Mr.
Nakamura Geihichiro	PERSON	, who happened to read about his financial difficulty in the papers , has volunteered to pay his old debts and arranged for the author to publish his work . ''

		If that work is ever completed , the industrious com - piler may well claim the title of the '' Japanese Johnson '' !

		The following paragraph from '' The Far East '' is significant : '' Since the outbreak of the war an interesting change has taken place in the relative value of foreign languages among Japanese students .

		While German is still assiduously studied by students at the univer - sities and higher schools , there has been a considerable falling off in the number of students of German who are preparing for a business career .

		This was well illustrated in the number of applicants for the Ger - man course at the
Tokyo School of Foreign	ORGANIZATION	Lan - guages this term .

		While there were 125 the year before the war , the number this year was only 62 .

		Applicants for the Russian course numbered 172 this year , in contrast with 93 last year , mainly due to the expansion of
Japan	LOCATION	's trade with
Russia	LOCATION	, and the desire to know more of Russian literature at first hand .

		The eagerness of many to learn of things Rus - sian may be gauged from the large monthly sales of books on
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians at the
Maruzen	ORGANIZATION	, while the Russian-Japanese conversation books are also much sought after .

		That the English language is receiving due attention from the majority of Japa - nese students needs no emphasis .

		It is noticeable , however , that the study of this universal language has been made much easier for the student to-day than twenty years ago , thanks to the scientific method employed in teaching by such men as Mr.
Saito	PERSON	of the
Seisoku School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The day of the English grammar is already gone .

		Present-day Japanese want to be more practical , since conversation and composition are occu - pying a great deal of their hours of study .

		Last but not least interesting is the fact that the Chinese vernacular is being enthusiastically learnt by many young men in view of the enormous trade prospects .

		The study of the Chinese classics is , however , as dead as the proverbial doornail in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The younger generation seems to be seeking only what is practical . ''


Japan	LOCATION	will not lag behind other nations in the celebration of the tercentenary of the death of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	on

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 157 THE PRFXCE OF '' COLVUMISTS . ''

		* Nothing under the sun is quite new .

		The combination of wit , humor , satire , and erudi - tion of an odd and unexpected sort , which characterizes that form of journalistic litera - ture technically known as the '' colyum , '' is commonly regarded as something distinctly modern .

		Its sprightly manner seems instinct with the spirit of this unusually present and up-to-date age of ours .

		But some forty-five years ago a professor of mathematics in
London	LOCATION	,
Augustus De Morgan	PERSON	, was doing precisely the same sort of thing in `` The Athenaeum , '' under the title , `` A Budget of Paradoxes , '' that
F. P. A.	PERSON	,
B. L. T.	PERSON	, and a few others are doing now in our metropolitan newspapers .

		Indeed , the modern exponents of this gentle art of `` colyuming '' might do much worse than to study De
Morgan	PERSON	for fine points of technique .

		In the deftness and sureness of his characterizations ; in the pre - cision , acuity , and yet unfailing good humor of his satire ; and in the nimble wit and verbal felicity of his writing altogether , this genial mathematician has never been sur - passed .

		Before his death , De
Morgan	PERSON	had started upon the pleasant labor of collecting and completing the `` Athenaeum '' papers , both by editing and by considerable additions of actu - ally new material .

		He did not live to com - plete it , however .

		The first edition of the `` Budget , '' which appeared in
1872	DATE	, was edited by
Mrs. De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	.

		In her preface she made many apologies for the imperfec - tions of the work in comparison with what it would have been could it have been finished by
Professor De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Without doubt the book did fall short of what it would have been under entirely favorable circum - stances , but in spite of all this it was imme - diately successful in point of sales .

		It was apparently never reprinted after the first edi - tion , and consequently soon became out of print .

		Second-hand copies have become in - creasingly rare as time has gone on , until in recent years it has become quite impossible to obtain the book unless one was prepared to pay a distinctly long price .

		This circum - stance , coupled with the permanent intrinsic worth of the book itself , has led Professor
David Eugene Smith	PERSON	, a distinguished student A BUDGET OF PARADOXES .

		By
Augustus De Morgan	PERSON	, F.R.A.S. and
C.P.S. of Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Re - printed , with the author 's additions , from '' The Athenaeum . ''

		Second edition , edited hy
David Eugene Smith	PERSON	.

		In two vol - umes .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the history of mathematics , to edit , and the
Open Court Company	ORGANIZATION	to publish , a second edition .

		By the fact alone of doing this thing , the editor & nd publishers have put the world of scholarship , in the very broadest sense of that term , greatly in their debt .

		Con - cerning the manner in which the re-editing of this classic has been done , the case is not quite so clear ; but on that matter comment will be reserved until a later point in this review .

		Let us first of all be quite sure that every - one is clear as to just what the `` Budget of Paradoxes '' is , what it has for an object , and the means taken to attain that object .

		Then we may proceed to discuss it with greater freedom .

		To the reviewer it seems odd that it should be necessary to explain what the `` Budget '' is : his own familiarity with the book , which covers in point of time the whole of his mature mental life , is so complete as to induce much the same sort of feeling in regard to explaining what the book is about , as one would have if he were to start to explain to grown-up persons what the
Bible	LOCATION	, or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or
Dickens	PERSON	, was about .

		In other words , it seems difficult to conceive that anyone can have reached even moderately adult life without having read at least some portion of the `` Budget of Paradoxes . ''

		But so great is our confusion of thought regard - ing the fundamentals of an education , that one must conclude that even within THE DIAL family there may be those for whom the pleasure of the elder De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's acquain - tance is still anticipatory .

		For such no better statement of the purpose of the `` Budget '' can be made than De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's own .

		The book opens with the following words : '' If I had before me a fly and an elephant , hav - ing never seen more than one such magnitude of either kind ; and if the fly were to endeavor to persuade me that he was larger than the elephant , I might by possibility be placed in a difficulty .

		The apparently little creature might use such argu - ments about the effect of distance , and might appeal to such laws of sight and hearing as I , if unlearned in those things , might be unable wholly to reject .

		But if there were a thousand flies , all buzzing , to appearance , about the great creature ; and , to a fly , declaring , each one for himself , that he was bigger than the quadruped ; and all giving different and frequently contradictory reasons ; and each one despising and opposing the reasons of the others I should feel quite at my ease .

		I should certainly say , My little friends , the ease of each one of you is destroyed by the rest .

		I intend to show flies in the swarm , with a few larger ani - mals , for reasons to be given ... '' During the last two centuries and a half , phys - ical knowledge has been gradually made to rest upon a basis which it had not before .

		It has 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	become mathematical .

		The question now is , not whether this or that hypothesis is better or worse to the pure thought , but whether it accords with observed phenomena in those consequences which can be shown necessarily to follow from it , if it be true .

		Even in those sciences which are not yet under the dominion of mathematics , and perhaps never will be , a working copy of the mathematical process has been made .

		This is not known to the followers of those sciences who are not themselves mathematicians and who very often exalt their horns against the mathematics in consequence .

		They might as well be squaring the circle , for any sense they show in this particular .

		`` A great many individuals , ever since the rise of the mathematical method , have , each for himself , attacked its direct and indirect consequences .

		I shall not here stop to point out how the very accuracy of exact science gives better aim than the preceding stage of things could give .

		I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer , and his system a paradox .

		I use the word in the old sense : a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion , either in subject-matter , method , or con - clusion . ''

		Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets , which is the nearest word we have to old paradox .

		But there is this differ - ence , that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it ; which was not the necessary sense of paradox .

		Thus in the sixteenth century many spoke of the earth 's motion as the paradox of
Copernicus	LOCATION	, who held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem , and some , I think , who even inclined towards it .

		In the
seventeenth century	DATE	, the depravation of meaning took place , in
England	LOCATION	at least .


Phillips	PERSON	says paradox is ' a thing which seemeth strange ' here is the old meaning : after a colon he proceeds ' and ab - surd , and is contrary to common opinion , ' which is an addition due to his own time . ''

		It might appear from this that the `` Budget '' was confined to the discussion of strictly scientific matters .

		Such a conclusion would be far from the fact .

		De
Morgan	PERSON	used the '' Budget '' as a receptacle for his opinions de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis .

		Mat - ters literary , social , political , pedagogical , editorial , historical , financial , classical , philo - sophical , and generally otherwise , all fell within his purview as naturally and easily as did things scientific .

		In fact , the subject - matter of the '' Budget '' may be characterized in Mr.
Venus	PERSON	's conveniently embracing ter - minology as `` human warious . ''

		A considerable part of the book is devoted to those hardy perennial paradoxers who square the circle , or , put in another way , who convince themselves and endeavor to convince others that they have discovered not only that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is exactly commensurable , but also just precisely what that measured ratio is .

		With the quadrating
gentry De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	has unmeasured fun .

		The most persistent and entertaining of the lot was Mr.
James Smith	PERSON	, of
Liverpool	LOCATION	.

		Of him the author says : '' When my work appeared in numbers , I had not anything like an adequate idea of Mr.
James Smith	PERSON	's superiority to the rest of the world in the points in which he is superior .

		He is beyond a doubt the ablest head at unreasoning , and the greatest hand at writing it , of all who have tried in our day to attach their names to an error .

		Common cyclometers sink into puny orthodoxy by his side . ''

		The behavior of this singular character induces me to pay him the compliment which Achilles paid Hector , to drag him around the walls again and again ... He will come out of my hands in the position he ought to hold , the Supreme Pontiff of cyclometers , the vicegerent of
St. Vitus	ORGANIZATION	upon earth , the Mamamouchi of burlesque on inference . ''

		This intention was carried out , fully and adequately .

		As is readily to be inferred from De Mor - gan 's definition of a paradoxer , already quoted , he distinguished many different spe - cies and varieties of the genus .

		Not all re - ceived the same sort of treatment as Mr.
Smith	PERSON	.

		De Morgan considered that he him - self belonged in the group which he classified as rational paradoxers .

		Under this name he included '' all who , in private life , and in matters which concern themselves , take their own course , and suit their own notions , no matter what other people may think of them .

		These men will put things to uses they were never intended for , to the great distress and disgust of their gregarious friends .

		I am one of the class . ''

		He goes on to tell the following anecdote of another rational paradoxer , Dr.
Isaac Milner	PERSON	, sometime President of Queen 's College ,
Cam	LOCATION	- bridge : '' He wanted a seat suited to his shape , and he defied opinion to a fearful point .

		He spread a thick block of putty over a wooden chair and sat in it until it had taken a ceroplast copy of the proper seat .

		This he gave to a carpenter to be imitated in wood .

		One of the few now living who knew him my friend , General
Perronet Thomp	PERSON	- son answers for the wood , which was shown him by
Milner	PERSON	himself ; but he does not vouch for the material being putty , which was in the story told me at
Cambridge	LOCATION	;
William Frend	PERSON	also remem - bered it .

		Perhaps the Doctor took off his great seal in green wax , like the Crown ; but some soft material he certainly adopted ; and very com - fortable he found the wooden copy . ''

		The temptation to go on quoting from this thoroughly delightful book is great , but must be resisted .

		To anyone who is familiar w r ith the '' Budget of Paradoxes , '' and at the same time has some understanding of the principles
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 159 of heredity , there is no uncertainty as to an important , if not indeed the chief , reason for the literary ability and charm of
William De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is doubtful if there is anywhere a more conspicuous and precise example of the inheritance of literary ability than in this notable son of a notable father .

		Every lover of the son 's novels should put the father 's '' Budget '' next them on the shelves , for if he likes one he is sure to like the other .

		Indeed , they are in some measure supplementary .

		For in the case of the novels one is bound to be - come interested in the progress of the story , and so be enticed to go on and on reading .

		The `` Budget '' has no plot , and if taken in too large doses might give one a severe case of mental indigestion .

		It is to be picked up and dropped into at random , and , after a choice morsel has been extracted , put back upon the shelf until again one wants a little nip of that exclusive brand of intellectual stimulant provided by the De
Morgan	PERSON	family .

		Coming now to the matter of the editing of this present reprint of the '' Budget , '' the reviewer finds his opinion somewhat at variance with that of the editor as regards the general plan , and widely so as regards the manner in which the plan has been executed .

		With such part of the editorial scheme as allowed no textual changes except the correc - tion of obvious typographical errors and the substitution of American for English spell - ing , there can be no serious quarrel , though upon the second point there might be differ - ences of opinion .

		The main feature of the new edition is something of a totally different order , however .

		It consists of some odd mil - lions -LRB- more or less -RRB- of footnotes , designed , in the words of the editor , '' to elucidate the text by supplying such information as the casual reader might wish as he passes over the pages . ''

		It may be granted that just possibly something is to be said for such a plan on theoretical grounds , as a general proposition regarding the editing of books of an earlier generation .

		But the sanity of the plan in any particular case obviously depends solely upon the manner in which it is carried out in that case .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	's idea of the mental equipment of those persons likely to read the `` Budget of Paradoxes '' is that , in the first place , they know no single word of any language other than the English , and that , in the second place , they are so com - pletely and totally ignorant of all history and literature that any and every allusion to per - sons or events must be fully explained in terms easily to be comprehended by the most ~ '' casual '' reader .

		To anyone who has not examined the book it will be nearly unbelievable that petty didacticism could be carried to such lengths as it here is , even in a text-book .

		Just for an example : on page 169 of Vol .

		I occurs the following passage , which is here set down literatim et punctatim as it occurs in the text : '' There is an awful paradox about the book , which explains , in part , its leaden sameness .

		It is all about I ` homme , I ` homme .

		I ` homme , 6 except as much as treats of les homines , les hommes , les hommes .

		7 .

		. ''

		At the bottom of the page footnote 6 furnishes the desperately needed information : `` Man , man , man . ''

		This is pretty bad , but worse is yet to come .

		Footnote 7 reads as follows : '' Men , men , men . ''

		Thus this difficult bit of idiomatic French is cleared up .

		and poor De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's little joke is fully explained , so that any '' casual '' idiot may easily compre - hend it .

		Many , many examples of the same sort of thing might be instanced , were there need to do so .

		The effect on the intelligent , in contradistinction to the editor 's `` casual , '' reader is like that which would be produced upon the readers of
F. P. A.	PERSON	's '' Conning Tower '' if each mention of
Washington	LOCATION	in that sprightly turret were to be garnished with a footnote to this effect : ''
G. Washing	PERSON	- ton , born
Feb. 22	DATE	.

		1732 , died
Dec. 14 , 1799	DATE	.

		first President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Popu - larly known as ' The Father of his Country . '

		A gentleman of very dignified bearing , much esteemed by his contemporaries . ''

		Xo doubt many utterly wearisome argu - ments might be adduced in support of the contention that in this day and age many of De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's allusions would be incompre - hensible , in the absence of these painfully lucid footnotes , to any but scholarly persons .

		But just in that argument lies the meat of the matter , in a manner totally unperceived by those who advance it .

		De
Morgan	PERSON	did not write the `` Budget of Paradoxes '' for unscholarly people .

		He spoke the language of sound , thorough , and mellow scholarship .

		He assumed , as a matter of course , that his readers understood that language .

		No more determined or bitter foe of all that is `` casual '' and shallow in intellectual matters ever lived than he .

		If as a people we have any one outstanding intellectual character - istic it is laziness .

		Intellectual laziness en - genders mental mediocrity .

		More and more does it become the dominant quality of our literature that it shall be capable of absorp - tion without the slightest effort , conscious or unconscious , on the part of the reader .

		This being a country in which all people are more or less free and equal , or at least like so to 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	consider themselves , there is probably noth - ing which can be done either about or to those persons who wish to have their intellectual pabulum so pre-digested that they need not stir a neurone in the process of getting it into their systems .

		But to pander to their low tastes in the name of Augustus De Mor - gan is a thing which no one who deeply hon - ors and cherishes the spirit of that genial scholar , who contributed not alone to the sum of knowledge but so notably to the joy of living , can allow to pass without vigorous protest .

		GERMAN HISTORIANS AND THE GREAT WAR .

		* In a report on public opinion in
Germany	LOCATION	, a report made to the French Minister of For - eign Affairs on
July 30 , 1913	DATE	,
M. Stephen Pichon	PERSON	said that `` some want war because in the present circumstances they think it inevitable / ' The remark was probably meant to apply only to those who felt that the con - crete situation was such that war could not long be delayed .

		But any analysis of the modern German conception of Kultur would find one of the pervasive characteristics of this '' specifically German way of thinking and feeling '' to be the notion that
Germany	LOCATION	, in the twentieth century , is destined to a position of material and moral supremacy .

		Fate , or
Providence	LOCATION	, or a `` force not our - selves that makes for righteousness , '' so it seems , has laid upon the Fatherland the cos - mic task of extending `` the German Idea '' in the world .

		Somehow or other this must be done : if by peaceable means , well and good ; if not by peaceable means , then in `` shining armor '' and with the good sword .

		In forming this conception of the German mission , many influences have united ; of these influences , not the least is that of the philosophy of history promulgated with so much learning and eloquence by German his - torians in the nineteenth century .

		M. Guilland , whose book appeared some years ago and is now very acceptably trans - lated into English , has attempted , in a num - ber of essays on certain historians ,
Niebuhr	PERSON	,
Ranke	PERSON	,
Mommsen	PERSON	, von Sybel ,
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	, to determine the character of this philosophy and to estimate its influence upon German political ideals .

		HISTORY OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY .

Heinrich von Treitschke	PERSON	.

		Translated by

Cedar Paul	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume I.
New York	LOCATION	:
McBride , Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		dealt fairly enough with his facts , and has given us a book that is fascinating reading from beginning to end .

		Nowhere in English will one find such masterly portraits of the great German historians , particularly of
Ranke	ORGANIZATION	,
Mommsen	PERSON	, and von Sybel , or a more penetrating analysis of that part of their work with which
M. Guilland	ORGANIZATION	is concerned .

		It is important to keep in mind , however , that he is concerned with the work of these historians -RRB- primarily only in so far as it had an influence in spreading abroad in
Germany	LOCATION	a peculiar philosophy of history .

		The reader has to remember , for example , that the '' His - tory of
Rome	LOCATION	'' was but a small part of
Mommsen	PERSON	's work as historian , a kind of political pamphlet , a very German pamphlet to be sure , which the author threw off by the way , as a sort of intellectual recreation .

		It is an author 's right , nevertheless , to limit his subject ; it is a reader 's business to remember what that limitation is .

		Undoubtedly
M. Guilland	PERSON	admires
Ranke	PERSON	more than the others .


Ranke	PERSON	was a good German , but then he was a good European also ; he could admire
France	LOCATION	, and he said many just things about Frenchmen .

		His serene good humor , his tolerance and sanity , the catholicity of his interests and his tastes , in a word the humanism and universality of his mind , distinguish him sharply from men like
Droysen	PERSON	and Treitschke ; we do not think of him as quite comfortable in the hot and irritating atmosphere which the later chauvinistic Prussian historians seemed to require as a stimulant .

		For this very reason it is more difficult to detect in the work of
Ranke	ORGANIZATION	, devoted as he was to describing the past wie es ist eigentlich gewesen , any influ - ence in shaping the political ideals of modern
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , in shaping these ideals , the work of
Ranke	PERSON	had a very real influence .

		The thinking of the nineteenth century , in many of its aspects , reflects the reaction from the ideas of the Revolution .

		The reaction from eighteenth century cosmopolitanism and the propagandist spirit of the Revolution found expression , particularly in
Germany	LOCATION	, in an exaggerated nationalism ; while the in - tense application , after
1815	DATE	, to the study of history , and the immense respect for the past which partly inspired and partly re - sulted from such studies , was one form of reaction from the rationalism of the
Philos	LOCATION	- ophes .

		Divine Right was a little obsolete , even in
Germany	LOCATION	, as a basis for political au - thority ; and after
Jena	PERSON	what German - could appeal to
Natural Right	ORGANIZATION	as a basis for lib - erty ?

		For the basis of authority and liberty
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 161 alike , therefore , most Germans turned to his - tory , seeking the meaning of the present and a guide to the future in the actual historical process , a process which came to be regarded as the true revelation of the divine purpose , or as an embodiment of universal reason in contradistinction to analytical thought or any individual 's rationalization of experience .

		The history of each nation could thus be counted on to furnish the guarantee for its own law and custom , as well as to justify its right to maintain them against any other nation .

		Few men did more to confirm this way of !

		thinking than
Ranke	PERSON	.

		To be sure , he did not j think of other nations as existing merely to !

		heighten , by contrast , the glory and great - !

		ness of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But if he conceived of his - tory in a universal sense , as '' the progress of mankind , '' and thus , in his insistence on the international character of European culture , reminds us of the cosmopolitan spirit of Vol - taire , he nevertheless has conceived of this progress in terms of `` the individuality of j nations , '' each nation at certain periods being , as it were , the incarnation of some great `` idea '' which at the particular time best expressed that `` multiple being which we are . ''

		The way was thus prepared for the belief that the Fatherland had contributed some - thing in the past to this `` progress of man - i kind , '' and that it was destined in the future , since the Germans were the only nation that i had retained the qualities of a genuine i `` urvolk , '' to be the home of God 's chosen | people .

		And if Giesebrecht depicted the glo - I ries of the Fatherland in the time of the mediaeval empire ,
Ranke	PERSON	himself , in his widely read '' History of
Germany	LOCATION	in the Time of the Reformation , '' had his share in establishing that modern formula of cosmic philosophy which , according to Professor
Dewey	PERSON	, in his '' German Philosophy and Politics , '' runs as follows : '' First , the German Luther who saved for man - kind the principle of spiritual freedom .

		.

		; then
Kant	PERSON	and Fichte , who wrought out the principle into a final philosophy of science , morals , and the state ; as conclusion , the German nation organized in order to win the world to recognition of this principle , and thereby to establish the rule of free - dom and science in humanity as a whole . ''

		`` When
Ranke	PERSON	's `` Reformation '' appeared , the organization of the German nation was rapidly becoming the central question of Ger - man politics ; and after the dissolution of the
Frankfort National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	the best chance of effecting such an organization seemed to be through Prussian leadership .

		To celebrate the history of
Prussia	LOCATION	as the state at once capable of guaranteeing order and establish - ing true freedom , and to set it over in con - trast against the history of
France	LOCATION	as the country where anarchy and license ran unre - strained under the mask of liberty , this was the task faintly forecast by
Ranke	PERSON	himself in his `` Nine Books of Prussian History , '' and finally completed by
Droysen	ORGANIZATION	,
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	, and above all by von Sybel .

		The latter , in his '' History of the Revolutionary Period , '' proved from newly discovered and unim - peachable sources that the French Revolution failed because its principles were wrong , and that the principles of the Prussian state were correct because
Prussia	LOCATION	would succeed , as the logic of its history clearly indicated , in achieving the unification of the German na - tion .

		If this great end could be attained only by `` blood and iron , '' no one should despair , not even good German Liberals .

		Prussia had not often accomplished her destiny by speeches and resolutions of Parliament ; be - sides , drastic methods would be well employed if by such means German minds could be purged of Gallic vapors and false doctrinaire principles of liberty and the Rights of Man .

		And in fact , as the Prussian historians justi - fied
Sadowa	LOCATION	, Sadowa in turn justified the Prussian historians .

		`` A king who so quickly brought about so fine a stroke , '' said
Treit	PERSON	- schke , `` must be right against everybody . ''

		Everyone was not as easily convinced as was Treitschke ; but nothing was lacking to a com - plete justification of the Prussian prophets when ,
five years later	DATE	, the lost provinces were recovered and the new German Empire was proclaimed , at
Versailles	LOCATION	, in the famous Hall of Mirrors of the ancient palace built by
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The most indifferent arguments are good , '' said
Bismarck	PERSON	, `` when one has a majority of bayonets . ''

		All the great events of that gen - eration the founding of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, the unification of
Italy	LOCATION	, the pres - ervation of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	, above all the success of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's policy of `` blood and iron '' seemed to illustrate and confirm this cynical philosophy .

		And these were pre - cisely the years when materialistic theories , borrowed from natural science , were modify - ing the older conceptions of man and his his - tory .

		Der Mensch ist , was er isst .

		If nature , in evolving the higher animals , employed the method of ruthlessly exterminating the weak through ceaseless conflict , could it be sup - posed that another method regulated the evo - lution of society ?

		Economic competition and war , what were they , what had they ever been , but nature 's test of the fittest ?

		In those years , when materialism had its day in 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	science , pessimism in philosophy , naturalism in literature , when religion seemed a spent force , the economic interpretation of history , of which the corollary was that principles and ideals and theories were but ingenious instru - ments forged in the service of deep-lying selfish interests , was profoundly modifying historical research and the attitude of histo - rians toward the past .

		If theories of this sort were to become widely popular anywhere , one might suppose that it would be in
Germany	LOCATION	, where natural science was in such high repute , and where
Bismarck	PERSON	, who had made and was consoli - dating the Empire in the spirit of a new
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, was the popular hero .

		In a sense one would be right in so supposing .

		Yet one would be wrong in supposing that the bald theory that `` Might makes Right '' was accepted and entertained in its primitive state , naked and unadorned , by the German mind .

		For the German mind is incurably idealistic ; and hence the materialism of natu - ral science , before it could be applied to political uses , had to be ideally transformed , had , as it were , to be draped and vestured with an attractive covering of morality and religion .

		No , might does not make right , says the German ; and the good
Bernhardi	PERSON	is amazed and shocked that anyone should find such a philosophy in his writings ; might is but the evidence of right , which you perceive is a different thing altogether .

		Could there indeed be a more profound pessimism than to suppose that the universe is so fashioned that the spirit of evil , der
Geist	PERSON	der stets verneint , could triumph in the end ?

		That nation which at any time attains a superior wisdom and virtue , a superior morality and culture , will by the sheer inner force of these qualities clothe itself with power .

		In the long run the fittest nation survives .

		It survives through force , certainly ; but this force , whether exer - cised indirectly through peaceable competi - tion or directly through war , is generated by a superiority in attaining the ideal ends of life , a superiority in intelligence and morality , a superiority in Kultur .

		Do not expect , therefore , to find German historians glorifying force , simply as force .

		The war of
1870	DATE	, said
von Sybel	PERSON	, was one of those necessary struggles `` between a young state wishing to make for itself a place in the sun and an old nation which was struggling to keep up its position . ''

		And
M. Guilland	PERSON	adds : `` After that , you would expect Sybel to describe in a straightforward manner this work of conquest , justifying the Prussian wars , as
Mommsen	PERSON	had done in his History of Home , by
Darwin	PERSON	's law of the survival of the fittest .

		Now this is not so . ''

		Certainly it is not so .

		Nor is it quite true , as
M. Guilland	PERSON	implies , that
Mommsen	PERSON	explained Roman his - tory as a triumph of force , as an example of the doctrine that might makes right .

		Momm - sen , as M. Guilland himself says elsewhere , '' seeks to show the reasons for the superiority of this people over the other peoples of ancient history . ''

		And what was this supe - riority ?

		The Italian , said
Mommsen	PERSON	, `` sur - rendered his own personal will for the sake of freedom , and learned to obey his father that he might know how to obey the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Amidst this subjection , individual development might be marred ... The Italian gained instead a feeling of fatherland and of patriotism such as the Greek never knew , and alone among the civilized nations of antiquity succeeded in working out .

		.

		a national unity which at last placed in his hands the mastery not only over the divided Hellenic stocks , but over the whole known world . ''

		That is to say ,
Rome	LOCATION	is not justified by her conquests , but her con - quests are justified by her superior moral qualities .

		In this way precisely have the German his - torians justified the conquests of
Prussia	LOCATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	and of
Germany	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Sub - stitute the word German for Italian , the word
Europe	LOCATION	for antiquity , and the word Celtic for
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	, and the sentence of
Mommsen	PERSON	might stand as the essential resume of all that has been said by the Prussian school about
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean history in the last two centuries .

		And of no German historian would this be so true as of the last and most chauvinistic as well as the most influential of the Prussian school ,
Heinrich von Treitschke	PERSON	.

		The present translation of the famous '' History '' was doubtless inspired by the fact that the name of Treitschke , almost unknown in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, suddenly became a word to conjure with in the multitude of arti - cles and books that endeavored to explain the Great War .

		In the circumstances , it is not strange that the work shows signs of having been somewhat hastily done .

		There are a good many misprints due to careless proof - reading ; and good German phrases have too often been taken over literally . ''

		Thought - struggles , '' `` World-all , '' `` Napoleon prepon - derantly esteemed the exact sciences , '' '' the thought-process of the Philosophers gave rise to a new moral view of the World-order , '' ''
Schiller	PERSON	's influence was more in the direc - tion of width , '' and similar expressions , are simply not English .

		But on the whole the volume reads well , and the translators have caught a good deal of the movement and flu - ency , a good deal of the lyric enthusiasm , and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 163 something of the plastic qualities , which make
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's work one of the great master - pieces of historical narrative .

		Now , that which inspires Treitschke 's '' History , '' that fundamental preconception which beyond everything else gives it char - acter , is the profound conviction , amounting to a religious faith , that the success of Ger - many in the nineteenth century was due to the intellectual and moral supremacy of the German nation .

		Treitschke reminds one of the arood English matron who sympathized with the French because they had the misfortune to be born in a foreign country .

		It could hardly be otherwise than that the Germans should attain supremacy over other nations ; in spite of themselves , a people whose car - dinal and commonplace virtues were obedi - ence , loyalty , steadfastness , and self-sacrifice , a people whose intelligence was at once so profound and so exact , must take the front rank .

		Where was so excellent a language as the German for expressing every kind of idea , or one so rich and flexible that the works of Shakespeare and Euripides acquired an addi - tional charm after having passed through the medium of the German mind ? ''

		Goethe 's
Iphigenia	LOCATION	, the poem which of all the works of modern art best attains the spirit of the antique , was nevertheless permeated by a sentiment of loving gentleness such as was never understood by the hard-headed heathen of antiquity . ''

		The truth is that
Treitschke	PERSON	, for whom the German army like the German language is a moral product , was as far as possible removed from the cynical pessimism of those who would agree with
Bismarck	PERSON	that `` the most indifferent arguments are good when one has a majority of bayonets . ''

		No word is on his tongue more often than '' ' moral `` or `` morality . ''

		He despises En - irland .

		not because she is weak , but because Englishmen are dominated by mercenary ideals which they hide behind a mask of cant - ing hypocrisy .

		For Treitschke , history is the result of moral forces , the revelation of the moral law ; and if
Prussia	LOCATION	has succeeded in j making
Germany	LOCATION	great , if
Germany	LOCATION	is des - tined to a position of predominance in the world , it is because Prussians better than other Germans , and Germans better than non - Germans , abide by this law which their phi - losophers have discovered and which their ; history confirms .

		Fundamentally .

		Treitschke i is not an historian , but a preacher : a preacher , < in dead earnest , who illustrates from the his - tory of nations the text that we Germans are the people and wisdom shall die with us .

		The doctrine that success , in the long run , is the evidence of right , is perhaps the only philosophy to be derived from history stud - ied objectively , as a record of what has oc - curred in the world .

		If , as the nineteenth century would have us believe , there is for us no revelation through inspired book or infalli - ble inner light of conscience , if for us the only revelation is through nature and history rationalized , what is left but to say with Hegel : '' The actual is the rational and the rational is the actual '' ?

		What is there for the historian to do but to find the qualities that explain the success of one nation over another , and , having found them -LRB- he should indeed be very sure that he has found them -RRB- pronounce them good ?

		But , obviously , good in a relative sense only .

		And this is impor - tant .

		If success is evidence of virtue , we must wait for the success before affirming the virtue ; the virtue is relative only to the par - ticular situation , not an inalienable possession of which we can assume the effectiveness in any other situation .

		This is a philosophy , therefore , excellently adapted to explaining the past , but dangerous in the extreme for predicting the future .

		Now , in the minds of the men who for the last decade have governed the Empire , the very men who have read
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's `` His - tory '' and have listened to him , at
Berlin	LOCATION	, preaching the incomparable virtues of the German people , this philosophy has suffered a curious transformation .

		These superior German virtues have , in their minds , taken on an absolute character , have come to be re - garded as something innate , as something which can not be lost by Germans or acquired unaided by nations less favored of the gods ; and thus is
Germany	LOCATION	's supremacy in the twen - tieth century thought to be an assured , indeed a necessary , result .

		Instead of success being taken as an evidence of superiority , an as - sumed superiority is taken as clear evidence of a cosmic mission which must fail unless the Fatherland shall bestride the narrow world like a colossus .

		`` It is perfect non - sense , '' says
Herr Kohrbach	PERSON	in his '' German World Policies , '' to say that
Germany	LOCATION	needs colonies for her expanding population .

		On the contrary ,
Germany	LOCATION	needs an expanding population in order to give '' enduring strength to her material expansion , '' the end of material expansion being the extension of `` the German idea in the world . ''

		What !

		Must the German mission fail because of a declining birth rate and the weakness of diplomacy in face of a consolidated Entente !

		Where , then , is this boasted German superior - ity ?

		German superiority must be proved at all costs , and for that the good sword alone remains .

		Thus was the Great War inevitable .

		164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	In such devious ways has the doctrine that virtue will clothe itself with power been trans - formed into the doctrine that the exercise of power is necessary to maintain an alleged virtue .

		The Germans of to-day , by dint of applying the lessons of their historians not wisely but too well , have somehow managed to get ahead of the schedule .

		They have dis - counted the historical process in order to realize on future values .

		It would be more mod - est , and more in accord with a safe philosophy of history , to let coming events reveal the con - tinued superiority of the German nation .

		But the patient Germans are singularly impatient ; without waiting for God to dispose , they have themselves , assuming the task of Fate , and with their accustomed efficiency , made to-mor - row 's programme in the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus have the Germans , so practical in dealing with the material world , lost touch with reality in dealing with the moral world .

		Professed devotees of real-politik , they remain idealists and doctrinaires to the end of the chapter !

		THE ESSAY IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* It would not be easy to find a recent vol - ume of literary criticism which more admira - bly satisfies a genuine need than Professor
Walker	PERSON	's study of the English essay .

		The rather peculiar difficulties about defining and evaluating the modern essay , touched upon in the author 's Introduction , are likely to pique the curiosity of even superficial readers ; while the comparatively late appearance of the type , placing
Bacon	PERSON	practically at the head of its English pedigree , spares the his - torian the necessity of the extremely attenu - ated treatment and constant shift of critical attitude incident to attempts at sketching the progress of older literary forms .

		Professor
Walker	PERSON	's twelve chapters , tracing the essay 's evolution from the pre-Baconian `` Anticipations '' to `` Some Essayists of Yes - terday '' i. e.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,
Laf	ORGANIZATION	cadio
Hearn	PERSON	,
George Gissing	PERSON	, and
Francis Thompson	PERSON	-RRB- , are themselves instinct with the allusiveness of thought , the epigrammatic grace , and the rich personal flavor which modern prose has learned from the best-loved recent essayists .

		Certainly it would be difficult to hit upon a better style than Professor
Walker	PERSON	's in which to write of essays .

		The best proof of its entire adequacy is the reader 's excited inter - est as sentence after sentence seems to strike the very heart and soul of the work criticized .

		* THE ENGLISH ESSAY AND ESSAYISTS .

		By
Hugh Walker	PERSON	, LL.D . ''

		Channels of English Literature . ''


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The writings of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	suggest this notable paragraph : '' Flawlessness is even more rare in prose than it is in verse , and if all the pieces were collected which a reasonable criticism could praise wholly without reserve , they would make only a very small volume .

		But an extraordinary proportion would come from Urn Burial a proportion higher than any other work of equal length would yield , possi - bly higher than could be gleaned even from the longest works . ''

		Lamb , another essayist whose distinctive merit it is certainly far from easy to express with conspicuous success , calls forth some re - marks which no sympathetic reader can let pass with ordinary approval : `` Lamb 's friends loved him and admired him ; and yet they had more than a suspicion that in the weightier matters they were his superiors .

		They were not .

		Lamb was , among other things , one of the wisest men of his time .

		The evidences of this wisdom are to be met with everywhere .

		It is the essence of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's criticism .

		No one but a man endowed with the very genius of common sense could have been so uniformly right as he .

		Taste alone will not do . ''

		Has the Olympian sweep and majesty of Dry - den 's prose , before which all lovers of unde - filed English must adore , ever been better characterized than in the following sentences ? ''

		The great merit of
Dryden	PERSON	is that his style would have suited
Solomon	PERSON	when he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in
Lebanon	LOCATION	even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall .

		No style written before is comparable with it in range .

		Its characteristics are lucidity and easy grace .

		It flows on apparently without effort and with that perfect art which conceals art .

		But it is art , not chance .

		Evidently
Dryden	PERSON	deliberately steered clear of the Scylla and Charybdis on one or other of which nearly all his predecessors were apt to strike ... He saw two deviations from what he would have called nature .

		It was a deviation to conceal meaning under verbal quibbles and by excessive condensation ; it was equally a deviation to conceal it in the maze of long involved sen - tences .

		The first business of prose was to convey a plain meaning unmistakably ; and this was best done by a style based upon that of conversation , yet differing from it as the permanent will differ from the temporary and the studied from the spontaneous .

		Such seem to be the principles that underlie the prose style of
Dryden	PERSON	. ''

		The vexed question of the relative merits of
Steele	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	has seldom if ever been more trenchantly answered than thus : '' There is such a thing as tone in writing , as well as style , and
Steele	PERSON	at his best is as much supe - rior to
Addison	PERSON	in the former quality as he is inferior in the latter . ''

		Again , the one mighty reservation which must always qualify our admiration of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's splendid achieve - ment in letters could hardly be better ex -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 165 pressed than as Professor
Walker	PERSON	expresses it : '' There are no dim vistas in his writings ; no man could be less of a mystic than he . ''

		Professor ``
Walker	PERSON	's appraisal of
Bacon	LOCATION	brings up fairly what is doubtless the most important question in the general criticism of the essay .

		He says : ``
Bacon	PERSON	is too stately , and his thought is too profound , to permit us to speak of the essays as the confidential chat of a great philosopher ... Just here we detect the secret of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's inferior - ity -LRB- of course merely qua essayist -RRB- to his model Montaigne or to the greatest English master of the form ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	.

		The ideal essay seems to imply a certain lightness and ease , and a confiden - tial relation between the author and the reader .

		That we find in
Oxford	LOCATION	in the Long Vacation and in Mrs. Battle 's Opinions on Whist .

		But not in
Bacon	LOCATION	. ''

		This verdict against
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	will be generally accepted at the present day .

		Yet on further thought the reader may well ask himself whether
Bacon	PERSON	's essays can safely be re - garded as inferior to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's when both are viewed sub specie immortalitatis .

		The charm - ing lightness of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	is achieved , in a large part of his work at least , at the cost of a leaning toward artificiality and affectation , which may render him two centuries hence a much less vital force than
Bacon	LOCATION	is to-day .

		Can it not be fairly doubted whether
Bacon	PERSON	's language and attitude deserve the epithet of '' stately , '' when compared with average
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan prose for example , with that of
Sidney	PERSON	or Hooker or
Ben Jonson	PERSON	?

		And may we not reasonably apprehend that the mere process of time , which has lent a somewhat stately tone to the essays on `` Studies '' and '' Truth , '' may render the '' Chapter on Ears '' positively grotesque ?

		English essays have been written , as it were , in three persons .

		Those of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, of
Addison	PERSON	, and of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, and
Dryden	PERSON	's prefaces , are third-personal .

		In the best of these , the writers seek conscientiously the ex - pression of ideas of universal validity , irre - spective of the special tastes of the authors or the peculiar interests of any particular class of readers .

		Such , we think , should be called , in a phrase which Professor
Walker	PERSON	invents for another purpose , '' essayists of the centre . ''

		The majority of the best English essays are doubtless of this type , and it would almost savor of literary snobbery to doubt that they have as a whole the best chance of weather - ing the fluctuations of changing taste .

		Bacon 's essays would inevitably be notable both for their enormous fund of abstract wis - dom and for the tremendous personality of their author ; but to be properly appreciated they must be read with a clear conception of the type of person addressed .

		They are dis - tinctly essays of the second person .

		Their content and their form are determined by
Bacon	PERSON	's vivid mental image of his ideal reader : the young Elizabethan -LRB- or Jacobean -RRB- of strenuous ambition and large opportunity , intent upon the completest self-realization in public life .

		Writers as different as
Steele	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	can be grouped in the same class .

		On the whole , the germinal principle in their most characteristic essays is neither the person speaking nor the things spoken about , but the reader addressed , the society person of Queen
Anne	PERSON	's Age , the early Victorian `` snob , '' or the morally and artistically unsteadied doubter of the `` yel - low nineties . ''

		In all such essays the horta - tory imperative is latent if not expressed .

		Lamb ,
Fuller	ORGANIZATION	, and Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	be - long to the third class of essayists : those who write mainly in the first person , whose espe - cial charm lies in their frank portrayal of their own delightful individualities .

		Profes - sor
Walker	PERSON	's treatment of these writers is par - ticularly happy , and he hardly hesitates to award them the palm over all the other En - glish essayists .

		Which of us at the present day is likely to act otherwise in selecting reading for our personal amusement ?

		Yet we hardly dare forget that there is a suspi - cion of the local and the temporal about such a predilection ; that the position of Fuller and
Browne	PERSON	as first-class literary figures de - pends as wholly as that of Lamb himself upon early nineteenth-century taste .

		Omens like the rehabilitation of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	as a critic and the increasing sympathy for
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	suggest that a radical change in taste may even now be on its way , that soon the business and love letters of a major poet may no longer , as at present , arouse a sin - cerer interest than his poetry , and that an essayist 's habitual exhibition of himself in bedroom slippers , instead of irresistibly at - tracting , may even revolt us as it would have revolted the eighteenth century .

		TUCKER BROOKE .

		A YOUNG POET 'S TRAVEL , IMPRESSIONS .

		* Charm of youthful personality and the pathos of an early death in his country 's ser - vice seem to have given
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	a measure of fame that long life and full oppor - tunity to mature his powers as a poet might not have brought him .

		At any rate there is a manifest disparity between his actual * LETTERS FROM

		But whatever his merit as poet , which time will determine with some degree of justice , it suffices for the pres - ent to acknowledge that there are a certain undeniable picturesqueness and romance about his youthful and buoyant and eagerly adventurous personality , and that to see the world renew its youth through his young eyes is a refreshing experience .

		This experience is made possible for all who can read by the publication in book-form of his '' Letters from
America	LOCATION	, '' chapters of travel that first ap - peared in '' The Westminster Gazette '' and , in two instances , at the end of the volume , '' The New Statesman . ''

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	contributes an introduc - tion of some length , in which , characteristi - cally enough , and to the satisfaction of his admirers , there is rather more of the mind and art of Mr.
James	PERSON	than of the character and appearance of Rupert Brooke . ''

		Noth - ing more generally or more recurrently solicits us , in the light of literature , I think , '' begins the great master of prose , '' than the interest of our learning how the poet , the true poet , and above all the particular one with whom we may for the moment be concerned , has come into his estate , asserted and pre - served his identity , worked out his question of sticking to that and to nothing else ; and has so been able to reach us and touch us as a poet , in spite of the accidents and dangers that must have beset this course . ''

		And so through three solid pages he marvels at the rare good fortune that has attended poetic genius , in the past and in our own time , in its struggle with the asperities of a harsh and cruel world which is all excellent in its way , but does not advance us far in our acquaintance with
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neverthe - less we do gather , in the leisurely course of this preface , the main facts of
Brooke	PERSON	's short life .

		He was born in
1887	DATE	at
Rugby	LOCATION	, where his father was a house-master , and he had two brothers .

		The father died in
1910	DATE	, one of the three sons at an earlier date , another in battle on the
Western Front	ORGANIZATION	, and
Rupert	ORGANIZATION	himself on a French hospital ship on his way from
Alex	PERSON	- andria to
Gallipoli	LOCATION	.

		He had finished his edu - cation at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, had won a fellowship at
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	, had travelled and seen the world and written two slender volumes of verse ; and now his mortal part lies buried on '' the steep summit of a Greek island of infi - nite grace .

		.

		placed in such earth and amid such beauty of light and shade and embracing prospect as that the fondest reading of his young lifetime could have suggested nothing better . ''

		In addition to the present collection of journalist letters , there is yet to appear , under the editorship of '' his intimate and de - voted friend , '' Mr.
Edward Marsh	PERSON	, another volume of letters so arranged and annotated as to make '' an admirable brief memoir , '' as .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	tells us ; and a footnote by Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	announces that '' there remain also to be published a book on
John Webster	PERSON	and a prose play in one act . ''

		And now let us turn to the '' Letters from
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Inevitably the visitor 's impressions of
New York	LOCATION	, the port of landing , fill the first few pages of his book .

		Of the great city in its night apparel of electric light we find him writing as follows : '' On the
Staten Island	LOCATION	ferry-boat you slip out from the darkness right under the immense sky - scrapers .

		As they recede they form into a mass together , heaping up one behind another * fire-lined and majestic , sentinel over the black , gold-streaked waters .

		Their cliff-like boldness is the greater , because to either side sweep in the
East Kiver	LOCATION	and the
Hudson Kiver	PERSON	, leaving this piled promontory between .

		To the right hangs the great stretch of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Suspension Bridge , its slight curve very purely outlined with light ; over it luminous trams , like shuttles of fire , are thrown across and across , continually weaving the stuff of human existence .

		From further off all these lights dwin - dle to a radiant semi-circle that gazes out over the expanse with a quiet , mysterious expectancy .

		Far away seaward you may see the low golden glare of
Coney Island	LOCATION	. ''

		It is plain from the outset that
America	LOCATION	is to be viewed with no coldly critical scrutiny , prosaic realities and ugly blemishes are to be thrust into no offensive prominence .

		Even the plain and undeniable facts of our too commercial , too careworn , too paltry existence are sometimes overlooked , sometimes even denied .

		Our bustling , hustling , nervous city - dwellers strike this young idealist as present - ing faces wonderfully free from wrinkles . ''

		Smoothness is the one unfailing characteris - tic , '' he writes .

		Our women , and our men too , are of a certain stately comeliness in his eyes . ''

		Handsome people of both sexes are very common , '' he declares ; '' beautiful , and pretty , ones very rare . ''

		Could one ask for a better instance of attributes possessing an excellence not '' unborrowed from the eye '' ? '

		As was natural and fitting , this young cor - respondent on his first visit to the New World was vividly impressed by the mere externali - ties and superficialities which an older , more experienced traveller would have passed by , or passed through , to the substance and meaning underneath .

		There is lightness and grace and charm in this rapid , careless , yet quickly observant and generously apprecia - tive survey of the Avonders of the western eon -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 167 tinent .

		Something more , too , than the surface aspect of things is occasionally reflected in these letters .

		Whether or not with the clear - est discernment , here is what the young En - glishman has to say , among other things , of
Boston	LOCATION	: '' The city sat primly on her little hills , decorous , civilised , European-looking .

		It is homely after
New York	LOCATION	.

		The
Boston	LOCATION	crowd is curiously En - glish .

		They have nice eighteenth-century houses there , and ivy grows on the buildings .

		And they are hospitable .

		All Americans are hospitable ; but they have n't quite time in
New York	LOCATION	to practise the art so perfectly as the Bostonians .

		It is a lovely art ... But
Boston	LOCATION	makes you feel at home without meaning to .

		A delicious ancient Toryism is to be found here . '

		What is wrong with
America	LOCATION	, ' a middle-aged lady told me , ` is this Democracy .

		They ought to take the votes away from these people who do n't know how to use them , and give them only to us , the Educated . '

		My heart leapt the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and was in a
Cathe	LOCATION	- dral or
University	ORGANIZATION	town of
South England	LOCATION	. ''

		Characteristic of the writer is the attention lie pays , in his first paragraphs on Niagara Falls , to the human element in the surround - ings of that wonder of nature .

		His glance notes first of all the '' hotels , power-houses , bridges , trams , picture post-cards , sham legends , stalls , booths , rifle-galleries , and side - shows , '' that fringe the central attraction .

		He gives ample space to the `` touts '' of all kinds , '' touts insinuating , and touts raucous , greasy touts , brazen touts , and upper-class , refined , gentlemanly , take-you-by-the-arm touts ; touts who intimidate and touts who wheedle , '' and so on for three-quarters of a i page .

		But at last he comes to the cataract itself and lets himself loose in some fine de - scriptive writing . ''

		Here and there a rock close to the surface is i marked by a white wave that faces backwards and seems to be rushing madly up-stream , but is really stationary in the headlong charge .

		But for these signs of reluctance , the waters seem to fling them - selves on with some foreknowledge of their fate , in an ever wilder frenzy .

		But it is no
Maeter	PERSON	- linckian prescience .

		They prove , rather , that Greek belief that the great crashes are preceded by a louder merriment and a wilder gaiety .

		Leaping in the sunlight , careless , entwining , clamorously joyful , the waves riot on towards the verge . ''

		Not to the beaten track of tourist travel does
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	confine himself .

		After seeing
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Montreal and
Quebec	LOCATION	and the
Saguenay	LOCATION	.


Toronto	LOCATION	and
Niagara	LOCATION	, he extends his journeying to the western prairies and the Rockies , to
Winni	PERSON	- peg and the vast
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, too , and the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	-LRB- for he was on his way to the Orient -RRB- receive some attention as the book draws to a close a book memorable and of a pathetic , roman - tic interest because of the attraction one feels for the high-hearted , joyous , engaging young poet who wrote it , and whose pleasing face , let it be added , looks out at us from the frontispiece , giving increased desire to read his letters of a first voyage to the new Far West and the old Far East .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		ROMAIN ROL-LAXD AS CRITIC .

		* A great critic will be likely to work in sev - eral different ways .

		He will generally make some detailed investigations and studies on things of more particular interest to him .

		He will generally begin in this way and so gain a solid foundation of fact in one place at least .

		Then he will also make more general studies , or rather write something of a more general character than his own special studies , on the great figures or the great movements or great questions of art that seem to him par - ticularly significant .

		He will also now - adays at least be likely to put his ideas into the form of fiction , and will produce stories , novels , or plays moulded by his feeling for life and art , or expressive of it .

		And lastly , he will be very likely to say what he thinks on questions of the day .

		Not all men who may be called great critics have done all these things , in fact there are but few who do all .

		But there are so many who do one and another , that all four seem the natural exer - cises of the critical power .


Romaiu Rolland	PERSON	has heretofore been most widely known as a novel-writer and a publi - cist the two aspects of the critic less com - monly thought of till late years at least .

		In '' Some Musicians of Former Days '' he is the student of musical history .

		In these days , when his soul is so wrung with more poignant events , he would perhaps not care to be thought of as the historian of the opera .

		But for us whatever we can get from his hand is of value , and there is an especial pleasure in reading this book written in happier days , when he could write as ' freely of
Gluck	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	as of
Luigi Rossi	PERSON	and of Lully .

		The subject of the book is of less general interest than that of its companion volume , `` Musi - cians of To-day . ''

		The early history of the opera in
Italy	LOCATION	and in

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	tion other matters of which he writes in the earlier immensely interesting volume .

		Here
M. Holland	PERSON	is more of an investigator , a spe - cial student .

		We should be quite unable to offer a criticism of the book in its especial field ; indeed there are probably few musical students who know enough of the intimacies of the musical history of
France	LOCATION	in the seven - teenth and eighteenth centuries to look at the book from a professional standpoint .

		But such a criticism is hardly needed for the gen - eral reader ; for most of us it is enough to say that here is a book by a man of broad view and of intimate knowledge , of very gen - eral ideas on art and very particular interest in detail .

		It is a remarkable combination , more significant really than
M. Holland	PERSON	's essays on subjects more of our own day .

		You may follow under his guidance along the his - tory of music from very early times , and you may study
Lully	ORGANIZATION	's recitative and
Racine	LOCATION	's declamation .

		There is one good thing about such a combination : it rather insures us against empty generalizations made on slight knowledge , on the one hand , and against the passionate insistence on details that are of little interest or importance except to the writer himself .

		One reads such a book with a sort of confidence .

		It not only gives con - tinual ideas , but it makes one feel that one is on solid ground .

		* The book on
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	is of another sort ; it is one of those larger generalizations which has been mentioned .

		We do no injus - tice to
M. Holland	PERSON	to suppose that he is by no means the specialist in the Italian art of the fifteenth century that he is in French music of the centuries following , or in fact to sup - pose that he has not the particular knowledge of painting , sculpture , architecture , and poetry -LRB- for in all these arts did
Michel	PERSON	- angelo excel -RRB- that he has of music .

		It is as a musical critic that he is especially known , * It is hard enough to give a. true idea of
M. Holland	PERSON	's powers without stopping for minor linguistic corrections .

		The translation of '' Musiciens d'autrefois , '' though in the main good , is quite often incorrect , not by the accident of a mistake here and there , but apparently as a result of not knowing enough of the author 's style and subject .

		On page 39 the translation reads '' the stag by St.
Eustace	PERSON	's crucifix '' ; the original reads '' du cerf au crucifix de saint
Eustache	PERSON	. ''

		It was , of course , the stag which had the crucifix , between his horns .

		Such errors -LRB- and there are a number of them -RRB- are not vitally important ; rather more so to our mind is an error of another kind which occurs now and then .

		M. Hol - land says something of art or life in general ; the translation puts it down to some particular time and place .

		Speaking of the art of music of the sixth century , the translation says on page 8 : '' From
Rome	LOCATION	it went to
England	LOCATION	, to
Germany	LOCATION	, and to
France	LOCATION	; and no art was more representative of its time . ''

		M.
Holland	LOCATION	wrote : '' Jamais art ne fut plus repre - sentatif d'un temps . ''

		The same passage shows also a way in which -LRB- to our mind -RRB- the translation fails to render the original .

		In many cases where the French has two sentences the translation merges them in one with a semi-colon and an '' and '' between the two .

		This is a different way of writing .

		We think it a poorer way ; but at any rate , it is not that of
M. Holland	PERSON	.

		We have not compared the text of the transla - tion with the original throughout , but we have done enough to show that there are too many errors like these .

		and yet it is one of the notes of his especial view of art that he should comprehend and wish to present the life and work of one of the greatest men in the other arts .

		He has written a short book on Beethoven in a series called '' Lives of Illustrious Men , '' but for the same series he has also written the lives of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	and of
Michelangelo	LOCATION	.

		This particu - lar book is another study prepared for another series .

		This book on
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	is a very char - acteristic piece of work ; it is a study of the man and his influence on his time rather than an exposition of the qualities of the different works of art which he produced .

		Those who think of art as a storehouse of powers or vir - tues , each with its especial effect upon the soul of man , will not find here any statement of the impression made by one or all of the works of Michelangelo upon the beholder .

		M.
Holland	LOCATION	goes from the work to the man : `` Nothing like Michelangelo had ever ap - peared before , '' says he .

		`` He passed like a whirlwind , and after he had passed the brilliant and sensual
Florence	LOCATION	of
Lorenzo de'Medici	PERSON	and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, of Verrocchio and
Leonardo	PERSON	, was ended forever .

		All that har - monious living and dreaming , that spirit of analysis , that aristocratic and courtly poetry , the whole elegant and subtle art of the ' Quattrocento , ' was swept away at one blow .

		Even after he had been gone for a long time , the world of art was still whirled along in the eddies of his wild spirit . ''

		It must have been a mighty force that did any such work ;
M. Holland	PERSON	is interested in showing what sort of force it was .

		We will not discuss that mat - ter ; we can fancy that the special students of music or of any of the arts might say that
M. Holland	PERSON	was a biographer or an historian rather than a critic .

		That matter need not distract our attention at the moment ;
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	might well say that music or any other art can never do more than give us the inspiration of a great soul , in fact , I am under the impression that he has made that statement somewhere .

		M.
Holland	ORGANIZATION	believes in great men .

		In
1903	DATE	he wrote as follows : '' The air is heavy around us .

		The old coun - tries of
Europe	LOCATION	are stifling in a dense and vitia - ted atmosphere .

		A materialism without grandeur weighs upon thought and hinders the action of government and individual .

		The world is dying of asphyxia in an egoism , that is base as well as prudent .

		It chokes .

		Let us open our windows .

		Let us let in the fresh air .

		Let us breathe in the air which has given life to heroes . ''

		This he wrote in an introduction to a life of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, `` notre Beethoven , '' as he likes
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 to call him , * meaning that a great man be - longs to the world .

		Perhaps
M. Rolland	PERSON	was the writer of an anonymous article in the `` Revue Bleue '' last Fall called `` Pourqu-on joue Beethoven . ''

		In that article
Beethoven	PERSON	and
Michelangelo	PERSON	were spoken of together as the '' two high-priests of the will to attain their ideal in spite of suffering . ''

		By a knowl - edge of such men we may endure a surround - ing world which we think we can not bear . ''

		We are not alone in the combat .

		The night of the world is aglow with divine lights . ''

		Such words will have a familiar sound to the readers of '' Jean-Christophe . ''

		Since he was able , it was most natural that
M. Rolland	PERSON	should have liked to imagine and to realize the figure of one who was always a rebel against the circumstances of a society which could not or would not give more than a light moment or two to one who believed in the things of the spirit . ''

		Jean-Christophe '' is a biography ; in it , as in these critical works .


M. Rolland	PERSON	goes straight to the facts of life as he knows them by his creative imagination , just as in the others his critical investigations show him the facts of life in monographs and memoirs .

		It would have been astonishing if such a voice had kept silent during the struggles and agonies of the past eighteen months .

		It is to be regretted that when that voice was heard there was shortly discerned a lack of harmony between its clear note and the voices of his countrymen .

		Yet it would have been strange had this not been the case .

		The temper of the political world has in the
last half century	DATE	been strongly nationalistic : such has cer - tainly been the tone in
France	LOCATION	; those who two years ago read the studies on the disposi - tion of the younger generation -LRB- for instance ,
Agathon	ORGANIZATION	's `` Les JeunesGensd ` Aujourd ` hui '' -RRB- will remember that one thing noted there was j that the young
France	LOCATION	of to-day was devoted to a patriotic faith , especially as compared with the generation now passing from the stage .

		In literature and the arts precisely the other thing has taken place : never has the ' world of art been so cosmopolitan .

		In the
last fifty years	DATE	the world has gone well along in realizing the conception which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	voiced for
England	LOCATION	some fifty years ago , of
Europe	LOCATION	'' as being for intellectual pur - poses , one great confederation , bound to a joint action and working to a common result . ''

		One does not want to depreciate either of * The translator of the '' Musicians of Former Days '' has omitted the word cmr on p. 15 .

		It is possible that the latest French edition does omit it : but whether due to publisher or translator , the omission is unfortunate .

		It is a privilege that by the translation of his books he is becoming more and more a well - known figure in our own country .

		AN
ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The elaborate '' Cyclopedia of
American Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' produced under the editorship of Professors
McLaughlin	PERSON	and
Hart	PERSON	, is an excellent work , which has suffered unduly at the hands of the critics .

		The present reviewer feels a bit inclined to throw '' his hat in the ring , '' and to write an essay on reviews and reviewers .

		He will , however , restrict himself to a few pertinent remarks , suggested by the treatment this work has received .

		There are two radically different ways of judging a book .

		According to one method , the reviewer may set up an ideal in his own mind quite different from the ideal of the author , and then blame the author because the latter does not conform to the reviewer 's ideal .

		The author may , for example , have intended to write a history of economic thought or of political theory which shall con - cisely endeavor to trace out only the great main currents that have made the science in question what it is .

		Many reviewers seem to think that in such circumstances the book is fruitfully criticized when it is pointed out that certain minor authors are not discussed , although it would have to be an entirely dif - ferent sort of book which should discuss these minor authors .

		The second method and it seems to the present writer the only fair method is to ascertain the task which the author set himself , and then endeavor to answer the question : In what measure has he successfully performed his task ?

		After this question has been answered , it is appro - priate to ask whether the task was one that was worth doing .

		In the case of the '' Cyclopedia of Amer - ican Government , '' it is easy to point out many things which might well have been dif - ferent .

		Many articles would be better if they were longer ; but this would have necessitated a much larger work .

		170 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	many of the articles could have been omitted , this also would imply a different sort of work from that which the editors planned .

		Let us consider , then , the task the editors set them - selves , as they describe it .

		They tell us that their experience as stu - dents and teachers has shown them the need of an encyclopaedia of
American Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		In their Introduction they speak as follows of the '' range of the work '' : '' In this work the word ' government ' is used as a comprehensive term ; it includes the theory or philosophy of political society , the forms of polit - ical organization whether those forms have been laid down in distinct , written law or are only more or less permanent modes of expressing the public will the methods and agencies by which law or governmental purposes are usually carried out . ''

		Perhaps the real nature of the work could be described better than the editors them - selves have described it .

		It seems to be an encyclopaedia for those whose primary inter - est is the
American Government	ORGANIZATION	, and to in - clude those articles within the broad field of the social sciences , including history , which would be of concern to such persons ; it being understood , however , that the appeal of each article is not primarily to the specialist , but to all those embraced under the somewhat vague expression , '' the intelligent public . ''

		The preacher , the newspaper editor , the teacher , the politician , these are some whom the editors have had in mind .

		Let us quote again from the Introduction : '' The book is meant for the general reader and for those whose interests and duties call them to the study of public affairs ; it is meant for the library , the study table , the editorial room , and the class - room ; it is meant for the writer or public speaker who wishes to obtain a certain amount of direct , concrete information on a special topic , and desires references to further and more detailed treatment .

		The editors have kept in mind also the needs of school and college students who wish to extend the information given in the classroom . ''

		How have the editors and the authors ac - complished their purpose ?

		The reply must be , '' fairly well . ''

		They have produced an extremely useful work .

		The editors , them - selves scholars of note , have gathered about them most of the American writers of author - ity within the field of the social sciences .

		It was to be expected that there should be inac - curacies here and there , certainly this could not be otherwise in the first edition of a work of this character .

		The present reviewer has read many of the articles , and those which he has read have been on the whole accurate , concise , and fairly well written .

		Each article is followed by a brief bibliography , which seems to include the more important works for those for whom this encyclopaedia is in - tended .

		Those who read the works mentioned will receive sufficient aid for more exhaustive studies , if they care to make them .

		The economic essays , which are naturally those tc which the present writer first turns , are good , Special mention may be made of the articles by Professor
E. H. Vickers	PERSON	, and he seems tc have written many .

		Professor Commons , an acknowledged authority on all labor ques tions , has made a number of useful contribu tions .

		An excellent article by Professor
H. J Davenport	PERSON	on economic distribution deserve ?

		mention , and perhaps also a word of criti cism , because it is too technical for those foi whom this encyclopaedia is intended .

		II would give ground for great surprise iJ among those who consult this work one persor in twenty would have anything but the vaguest idea of what Professor
Davenport	PERSON	is talking about .

		On the other hand , his essaj is a valuable resume for the special studenl of economics .

		Articles by Professors
Ernsi Freund	PERSON	,
W. W. Willoughby	PERSON	, and
Jesse Mac	PERSON	^ will attract attention .

		It seems somewhat in vidious , however , to select out those whos < names have been mentioned .

		Just as good , 01 perhaps better , articles have been written bj others in the large group of contributors .

		The law articles are accurate , but they ma ^ be criticized as jejune .

		They are too formal and , so far as the present reviewer has ob served , they entirely fail to take note of th < new spirit which is entering into the law They do not give even an approximately ade quate idea of the social questions involved it legal discussions at the present moment , anc do not suggest the work ' which has been dom in recent years under the designation of socio logical jurisprudence .

		One does not get the impression that to th < editors the preparation of this encyclopaedia has been a labor of love .

		They could hardb have contemplated it as a monument to them selves .

		Probably they did not look upon it a : a work to be revised and re-revised and con stantly associated with their names .

		When i is compared with the German ''
Handwb	PERSON	` rter buch der Staatswissenschaften , '' the contras becomes painful .

		The late Professor Conrad editor-in-chief of the German work , doubtlesi looked upon the '' Handworterbuch '' as om of his main contributions to economics am political science , and probably would hav < mentioned his labors in connection with thi '' Handworterbuch '' as ranking next to hi editorship of the `` Jahrbucher fur National oekonomie und Statistik . ''

		The contributor to Conrad 's '' Handworterbuch '' seem gener ally to have taken their contributions mor <
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 171 seriously than perhaps most of those who have contributed to the '' Cyclopedia of
American Government	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Perhaps , however , American conditions are as much to blame as the shortcomings of editors and authors .

		The publication of a work of this kind appears to be far more ex - pensive in this country than in
Germany	LOCATION	, and the possible contributors fewer .

		German pub - lishers seem to find a work like Conrad 's '' * Handworterbuch der Staatswissenschaften '' remunerative , either directly or indirectly ; and they are able to get out edition after edi - tion , each one an improvement upon the pre - ceding .

		It may be doubted , on the other hand , if the publishers of the '' Cyclopedia of American Government '' will ever get their money back : and it is to be feared that the sales will not warrant new and improved edi - tions from new plates .

		The editors should have had more money at their disposal .

		Then , too , the authors - should have put more time upon their work .

		if they had been writing for the ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- pedia Britannica '' they certainly would have done so .

		Probably it is not possible under American conditions to publish without a subsidy a work comparable to Conrad 's '' Handworterbuch . ''

		Even if the present work is worth while as having in a measurable degree accomplished its purposes , probably the editors would be well advised not to at - tempt a similar task again , unless they could have a large and generous subsidy , and so be able to make their work really monumental .

		The editors gave four years to their task : but doubtless they had their regular duties as university professors to perform , and other literary projects on their hands at the same time .

		But after all .

		both publishers and editors deserve commendation for undertaking a diffi - cult task under discouraging conditions .

		If a score card is to be filled out with one hundred as the highest mark , the publishers would per - haps deserve a grade of ninety , the editors eighty-five , and the authors eighty-three .

		making a composite of all the authors .

		Those for whom the work is intended will find it well worth while .

		Professor
Lightner `` Witmer	PERSON	, of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, has brought together the documents and opin - ions in `` The Case of Dr.
Scott Xearing	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- with editorial skill and a fair con - sideration of the party of the other part .

		One need not conclude that all is rotten in the
State of Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in order to be con - vinced that all is not well there .

		The tenure of academic positions , the grounds of dismissal of Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	, the considerations to be ob - served in academic relations , the merits and demerits of Dr.
Xearing	PERSON	as an academic ex - emplar and public servant , are all involved : and over and above all , the infringement of academic liberty .

		The evidence of the compe - tence of Dr.
Xearing	PERSON	.

		judged by standards at once critical and appropriate , seems complete ; his teaching was effective and appreciated .

		The question of the influence of a man 's tem - per , manner , poise , in reflecting a responsible sense of his utterances as representative of his
University	ORGANIZATION	, is a nice one .

		and less decisive in the present issue .

		Admissions of indiscre - tion are rather unpleasantly entangled with reformatory zeal in opposition to views and interests dear to members of the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	.

		Out of the controversial tangle and the series of newspaper charges and counter - charges a few things of vital import are clear .

		The mode of dismissal of Dr.
Xearing	PERSON	is indefensible , as equally the policy under which the action was taken is incompatible with the protection of inalienable rights and dignities of an academic position : the mode of government in practice at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	is not conducive to the best interests of an institution of the higher learn - ing : the considerations weighing with that body , and the suspicion of employing an offi - cial position to undermine the forces which they regard as inimical to their personal inter - ests , and all the underground byways of influence that play their part in the political arena .

		these strengthen the charge of dubi - ous integrity of purpose of the trustees .

		Xothing is white or black : but much of it shades closely into the darker grays of inter - ference with academic freedom .

		It may be that the dismissal of Dr.
Xearing	PERSON	was both wise and defensible .

		The manner of his taking off and the disclosure of the question - able `` diplomatic '' setting of the Xearing case leave an unpleasant impression , which it is the business of those concerned and directlv 172 THE DIAL -LSB-

		_ , , - n - I - .

		T * .


Stephens	PERSON	s French Novelists of To-day '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- elaborates the theory that '' the French novels produced since the begin - ning of the century show that
France	LOCATION	, like the rest of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, has been experienc - ing a revolt against intellectualism ; that in French writers there has been a tendency to return to authority to evince a preference for instinctive rather than rational methods , to insist that man is after all only a little bit reasonable , that reason plays a very minor part in his life ; and even to minimise that minor part . ''

		The chapter makes a fairly suc - cessful effort to clarify that which can never be fully clarified for English or American readers , the interwoven influences of poli - tics , religion , and philosophy which must form the background for the study of any French man of letters .

		Frequent reference to two notable figures ,
Charles Maurras	PERSON	and
Maurice Barres	PERSON	, lends the discussion concreteness .

		Thereafter consideration is given , successively , to
Marcelle Tinayre	PERSON	,
Romain Holland	PERSON	-LRB- with a separate chapter on `` Jean Christophe '' -RRB- , the Tharauds ,
Rene Boylesve	PERSON	,
Pierre Mille	PERSON	, and
Jean Aicard	PERSON	.

		In each case the life and the intellectual development of the writer are traced , the important works summarized , and the novelist 's art and theories subjected to balanced if not always searching criticism .

		The volume , which is provided with portraits , an index , and brief bibliographies , very well serves its purpose of introducing the English - speaking reader to several novelists of con - temporary
France	LOCATION	.

		Memoirs of Some interesting light on fairly a Japanese recent Japanese diplomacy may be found in '' The Secret Memoirs of Count
Tadasu Hayashi	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which have been edited by Mr.
A. M. Pooley	PERSON	, for - merly Renter 's Correspondent in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The chapters dealing with the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, by far the most interesting in the volume , were published in
Japan	LOCATION	and abroad in
1913	DATE	.

		Mr.
Pooley	PERSON	, however , secured a new text , as well as additional chapters of ` the unfinished memoirs , and has reprinted several articles by Count
Hayashi	PERSON	from Japanese periodicals .

		The negotiations leading to the first Anglo-Japanese Alliance are dealt with in full , for Count
Hayashi	PERSON	was Minister to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and a warm advocate of the arrange - ment .

		There was , however , some discussion of a Russo-Japanese Alliance at this time , in which Prince
Ito	PERSON	and
Marquis Inouye	PERSON	, two of the Elder Statesmen , were prominent ; and Prince
Ito	PERSON	actually took up the matter with Russian statesmen in
Petrograd	LOCATION	while
Hayashi	PERSON	was negotiating in
London	LOCATION	.

		Although there are brief chapters on the American-Japanese notes of
1908	DATE	and the
Immigration Question	ORGANIZATION	, they are less suggestive than those in which
Count Hayashi	ORGANIZATION	defends the policy of the
Saionji Ministry	ORGANIZATION	toward
China	LOCATION	.

		As he had been Minister to
China	LOCATION	as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs , his views on the Chinese ques - tion are well worth noting .

		He frankly states that
Japan	LOCATION	drove
Russia	LOCATION	out of South Man - churia for purely selfish reasons .

		He believes that there will be many questions to be settled between
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, but he counsels moderation and patience .

		He stands for the principle of the integrity of
China	LOCATION	and the `` open door , '' and asserts `` there is no longer any desire to obtain control of parts of
China	LOCATION	for
China	LOCATION	is a very difficult country to man age and the population is very large . ''

		Bui he also believes '' the way to deal with
Chins	PERSON	is for the Powers to combine and insist or what they want and to go on insisting unti -RSB- they get it . ''

		Perhaps the recent Sino-Japa nese negotiations might have taken anothei course if Count
Hayashi	PERSON	had lived and helc his old portfolio in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		ri Ml Mr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	's chatter about `` Another Book on the Theatre ' the theatre .

		-LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is described by its au thor , a
New York	LOCATION	professional dramatic critic as `` a collection of haphazard , fugitive anc some might say impudent reflections in and or the mirror which the theatre is supposed t -LRB- hold up to nature but with which , instead , ii more often holds up its patrons . ''

		It differs from most books on the theatre by concerning itself with actual drama on the stage rathei than with literary drama in books .

		Mr
Nathan	PERSON	declares himself a destructive critic '' The destructive critic occupies an honest anc helpful position in the community .

		He is t -LRB- drama what vaccine is to smallpox .

		He make !

		a bit of a mess , to be sure , and a lot of childrer kick around with a vague idea that they ough to combat him , and he makes a great many per sons sore , but he does not fail of his purpose . '

		In this destructive capacity , Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	as sails everybody and everything in the theatri cal world .

		He assails `` constructive '' critic ; as '' mountebanks , those bizarre minstrels wh <
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 173 bore peaceful managers and rich playwrights and poor actors and a helpless public with sapient twaddle anent technique , the unities of Aristotle and other anachronistic wisdoms . ''

		He assails '' the toothless professors of the tra - ditions and the kindly conservative quacks . ''

		He assails the theatre-going public : '' We Americans are critically a nation in the con - stant state of having just had three cocktails on an empty stomach .

		We are ever ready and eager to cheer the guesswork of the nearest press agent .

		We are the back-slappers of the cosmos , the have-a-drink convivials of the world of art , the good fellows , the lodge broth - ers and the come-ons ... We welcome all artists but artists . ''

		He assails most of all , of course , plays , playwrights , players , and managers .

		His book is full of well-deserved ridicule , satire , burlesque , and downright con - demnation .

		For this we are all grateful .

		It is too full , however .

		Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	yields to the temptation inherent in facile wit and the knack of '' punchy '' language , and defeats his own purpose by a certain indiscriminateness of attack .

		He reminds us of his own defini - tion of the '' young dramatic critic '' as '' being usually inclined to throw his education around and to concern himself with being assiduously witty . ''

		There is really not much excuse for the printing of such criticism in book form .

		In spite of its praiseworthy stand for dramatic art , it contains little that is not journalisti - cally smart and exaggerated in both matter and language .

		Its chief appeal will be to theatre-goers in
New York	LOCATION	and other large cit - ies where there is still acted drama .

		Add to this that it contains too much sex wit .

		Old - fashioned Puritan reticence was at least as moral as modern so-called truthfulness , and quite as funny .

		An English ^ r
Edwin Pears	ORGANIZATION	has published diplomat in his memoirs of life in
Turkey	LOCATION	lnople - under the title , '' Forty Years in
Constantinople	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The number is really an understatement , for Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's residence in
Turkey	LOCATION	extended from
1873	DATE	to
1915	DATE	.

		During that time he witnessed three revolutions , saw three Sultans deposed and eleven British ambassadors come and go .

		Al - though he held no official position , his emi - nence as a lawyer in the Consular Courts and his long experience of affairs in the
Near East	LOCATION	combined to make him a valued unoffi - cial adviser of the British government .

		One can readily understand how the transparent honesty and sound common sense of this sturdy Yorkshireman must have proved of inestimable assistance in dealing with the tor - tuous Levantines .

		Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's reminiscences are based on memory , his books and notes having been left in
Constantinople	LOCATION	when he was compelled to depart in
December , 1914	DATE	.

		This no doubt accounts for the somewhat sketchy nature of the first part of the book .

		The second , and for us the more interesting , half deals with events from the beginning of the
Young Turk	ORGANIZATION	movement to the outbreak of the present war .

		The book is soberly , even dully , written , but compels interest because it is a record of great events sincerely observed .

		There are incidental pictures of many famous men ,
Skobeleff	PERSON	,
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	, von der
Goltz	PERSON	,
Biberstein	PERSON	,
Abdul Hamid	PERSON	,
Enver Pasha	PERSON	, and others .

		It is Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's task also to show how sentiment in the English colony in
Constantinople	LOCATION	changed during those years from pro-Turkish and anti-Russian to the exact opposites .

		The author himself was never a Turkophile .

		As correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' he was instrumental in arousing English indignation over the Turk - ish atrocities in
Bulgaria	LOCATION	and thus in influ - encing
Gladstone	LOCATION	's later conduct .

		Neverthe - less , Sir
Edwin	PERSON	freely recognizes that the Turk in his private capacity is kindly and amiable ; it is as a ruler of subject races that he has failed lamentably . ''

		The Turkish gov - ernment has never known how to treat its discontented subjects in any other way than by means of massacre , '' is a sentence that has been hideously confirmed by events which have happened since it was written .

		In the reconstruction which will follow the war he pleads that the seven millions of real Turks be allowed to constitute a nation by them - selves , though under no consideration to hold sway over other peoples .

		Sir
Edwin	PERSON	shows clearly from the inside what had already been fairly plain to outside observers , that it was
Germany	LOCATION	who forcibly jockeyed
Turkey	LOCATION	into the war in the
autumn of 1914	DATE	.

		American readers will be interested in the author 's praise of the splendid civilizing work of Rob - ert College , and in his appreciation of the services which Ambassador
Morgenthau	PERSON	has rendered to all the Western Europeans in
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The handsome book contains many fine illustrations .

		A detective story in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		Admirable indeed is Mr.
E. Pannalee Prentice	PERSON	's courage in continuing the publication of his `` Mount Hope Classics '' in the face of an inevitable popular indisposition to buy and read even current fiction in Latin dress .

		But he has distinguished company in his endeavor to find fit audience , though few ; and the appreciation he meets with must make up in 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 17	DATE	quality what it lacks in quantity .

		Volume three of the series is just out -LRB- volume two , a collection of short stories , being delayed -RRB- and is entitled `` Mysterium Arcae Boule . ''

		No profound knowledge of Latin is needed to enable one to recognize in this Mr.
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	's detective story , '' The Mystery of the Boule Cabinet , '' though why the transla - tor , Dr.
Arcadius Avellanus	PERSON	, chooses to accent the famous French cabinet-maker 's name and thus mystify the reader , passes understand - ing .

		Andre
Charles Boule	PERSON	-LRB- or
Boulle	LOCATION	-RRB- pro- nounced his patronymic in one syllable , and so unquestioned is this pronunciation that ''
Boule	PERSON	work '' is often written , in German fashion , `` Buhl work . ''

		As might have been expected , a modern novel of this kind offers opportunity for much ingenuity in Latinizing colloquialisms ; and praise is due the transla - tor for his linguistic dexterity .

		Here are a few examples . ''

		You blithering idiot ! ''

		be - comes , in the speech of the ancient Romans , `` Bipedum stultissime ! ''

		`` It 's all right '' is put with even greater brevity , `` Nihil mali . '' ''

		Well , I 'll be damned ! ''

		is not quite so easily recognized in '' Quid , malum ! '' ''

		It 's too much for me '' is translated , `` Vires meas omnino excedit . ''

		Occasionally a somewhat unnecessary departure from the letter of the original is to be noted .

		Before one has read twenty lines a noticeable instance occurs .

		The narrator speaks of walking `` toward
Washington Square	LOCATION	, just above which , on the Avenue , the old Vantine mansion stood . ''

		These words become in
Latin	LOCATION	, `` versus Com - pitum
Washington	LOCATION	, paullo supra eum locum Plateae , ubi vetustae gedes Vantinianae sta - bant , '' which does not reproduce the relative clause of the original .

		Again , at the begin - ning of chapter eight , '' Give him a whiff of this '' -LRB- referring to a bottle of ammonia -RRB- is rendered , `` Praebe illi paucas guttas ex hoc . ''

		Halitus would seem to be nearer the mark than gutta .

		But enough of hair-splitting .

		It is a first-rate book with which to polish up , easily and enjoyably , one 's rusty Latin .

		Mr.
E. Parmalee Prentice	PERSON	, 37 Wall St. ,
New York	LOCATION	, is the publisher .

		Ethical ` aspects J / nder the SUggCStive title of of the Freudian `` The Freudian Wish -LRB- Holt -RRB- , Professor
E. B. Holt	PERSON	of Har -
vard University	ORGANIZATION	has produced a thoroughly readable and in some aspects notable book .

		The much discussed and equally disparaged and acclaimed doctrine of Freud has en - livened psychological discussion in many a field .

		The doctrine attaches significance to the by-products of the mind 's occupations , and sets forth the mechanism in which mean - ing lies .

		Life is a conflict between desire and the restricted range of expression which op - portunity , convention , scruple , restraint , and all the many forces of repression make possi - ble or seemly .

		The undercurrent of desire breaks through in occasional indulgence and sporadic reactions , and yet more subtly and evasively in a series of minor lapses and un - absorbed impulses now caught , examined , and disclosed by the insight of a Freudian scru - tiny .

		Dreams , jokes , forgettings , mis-speak - ings , are all similarly significant ; they reveal a covertly entertained longing or wish , and have an intricate motive history .

		Professor
Holt	PERSON	develops the ethical import of the Freu - dian doctrine , and sets forth with much ingenuity how the conflicts of duty and of moral hesitation find their clarification in Freudian terms .

		Much of this exposition and analysis is as much
Holt	PERSON	as
Freud	LOCATION	, but it is consistently developed from the Freudian premises .

		It harks back to
Spinoza	LOCATION	as the original Freudian , in his statement that thinking and wishing are one ; and it harks back to the Socratic method , as well as to the Socratic doctrine that makes ethical conduct the most discriminating wisdom .

		It is the resolution of doubt by the absorption and integration of conduct in a higher unity of consistency -LRB- as opposed to the yielding of compromise and to the ascetic rejection and repression -RRB- whereby inner conflict develops rather than thwarts .

		The doctrine as it is thus barely outlined seems meagre and poor to account for the richness of actual experience ; but significance lies in rating , and motives are as important as actions .

		What often repels in the Freudian view is not the principle of interpretation , but ` the detailed reference of trivial inclinations to areas of desire , such as that of sex most conspicuously , quite too re - mote , and equally quite too pathological , to form an acceptable raison d'etre .

		It is indeed unfortunate that the Freudian principle has come so largely into psychology with a patho - logical tang ; and it is one of the merits of Professor
Holt	PERSON	's little contribution that it restores the perspective by an exegesis in nor - mal terms and familiar situations .

		But where conclusions are no longer repugnant , they still seem far-fetched , like etymological derivations of obscure expressions whose history is really conjectural .

		But therein lies the psychologi - cal lure .

		Men will delve for significance so long as the prospect is promising ; and the discoveries of
Freud	LOCATION	, though they may not prove in all cases to be readily worked gold - mines , have opened valuable veins in the sub - terranean galleries of the mind .

George Crile	PERSON	's so / .

		, , A Mechanistic view of War and Peace '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is unusual and espe - cially interesting .

		It is a very readable account of a physician 's observations of the physiological effects of the various phases of war on combatants and non-combatants .

		What herculean performances of endurance are performed by men under the extraordi - nary stimulus of combat is most entertain - ingly stated , and fortified by excellent and abundant illustrations .

		Particularly note - worthy is the absence of pain when soldiers are under high tension , and the support this gives to Dr.
Crile	PERSON	's belief that pain has its basis in muscular reactions .

		The fighting in - stinct , according to Dr.
Crile	PERSON	, is a race inheri - tance which has left what he calls `` action patterns '' in the mind of man .

		`` War is a stimulus which causes man to act ; action is his safety valve , forced inaction his undoing .

		Hence the desire of generals to have armies doing , or thinking they are doing , something .

		Hence also the deleterious effects on a popu - lation , like that of
Belgium	LOCATION	, which is estopped from acting according to its desires .

		Action patterns come not only as a race inheritance but as the result of education .

		Of this Ger - many furnishes the best illustration .

		Dr.
Crile	PERSON	sees the significance of this , and urges deliberate effort to impress peace patterns on the human mind as the best and most effective way of ridding the world of the curse of war .

American Commerce	ORGANIZATION	in the Years 1914-1915 '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Edwin J. Clapp	PERSON	deals mainly , though not ex - clusively , with the British Orders in
Council	ORGANIZATION	relative to neutral trade with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The book was written , Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	tells us , because it seemed to him that `` we Americans were paying too much attention to the affairs of the belligerents and too little to our own . ''

		The writer begins by a brief statement of the rights of neutrals on the high seas and in the conduct of international trade , as formulated by the
London	LOCATION
Naval Conference	ORGANIZATION	of
1909	DATE	and the Hague Conventions , and then proceeds to show how , in the stress of actual war ,
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, but
England	LOCATION	chiefly , have failed I to conform their war practices to the rules thus ; established .

		After discussing the trade situa - tion during the early months of the war , the I extension of the list of contraband goods , and the methods
England	LOCATION	took to prevent the neu - , tral nations from supplying
Germany	LOCATION	with the !

		necessities of war , Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	deals succes - I sively with the attempts to continue the trade !

		in the more important commodities , such as grain , meats , cotton , coffee , rubber , wool , tea , I potash , dye-stuffs , fertilizers , and oil .

		Trade | in these articles should be free and untram - i meled by Orders in
Council	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	argues , because historically speaking they have always been so treated in times of war and because otherwise the
United States	LOCATION	producers are de - prived of a valuable market both during and : after the war .

		Although , according to Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	,
Germany	LOCATION	can not be starved out during the war , she can be forced to become self - supporting in all these commodities , and thus after the war a valuable customer will be lost to us .

		England should be made to observe the usual rules of trade ; and if necessary to secure the rights of neutrals , the
United States	ORGANIZATION	should declare an embargo on the exportation of arms .

		There would be no need of a formal session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the writer affirms , to accomplish this .

		Let the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	but intimate that the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	is prepared to call such a session and the desired result would be 176 THE DIAL
Feb. 17	DATE	obtained -LRB- p. 308 -RRB- .

		The book testifies to the effi - ciency of the English Admiralty in enforcing the blockade of German ports , and in sup - pressing trade which , notwithstanding the ut - most vigilance , has been regularly carried on through the countries adjacent to the German Empire .

		Thoughtfully observant of The harvest of every-day events is the anony - a quiet eye .

		mous author of On Staying at Home , and Other Essays '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , who merely designates himself on the title-page as '' the author of ' Times and Days , ' etc. '' But good wine needs no bush , and a good book needs no sounding name after its title .

		Sane and sensible is one 's outlook on the world when one can say , as this author opens his book by saying : '' I confess I have no sympa - thy with those that travel .

		I think it is empty heads that make itching heels , and I am convinced that wise people can learn more by staying at home than by going abroad . ''

		Excellent also and typical of the tone of these unpretentious but well-written essays is the following : '' If you prefer to be appreciated by some of the best , you will live quietly , think sedately , write slowly , and be careless whether the ' run and read ' reviews praise or dispraise , so long as your own taste and con - science can accept your work as worth doing . ''

		This , too , is good : `` A vase is made of clay , let us say , which is its substance ; but it is not a vase unless it has shape .

		And so a truth may be all very well , but the truth is the way it is presented to you , and the style or manner is as essential to the result as the substance or message which is conveyed . ''

		But as the author , in his penultimate essay , cen - sures excessive indulgence in quotation , we must refrain from further sampling of his wares .

		Two-score topics -LRB- less two -RRB- are han - dled with penetration in the little book , which is from no ` prentice pen , as there are twelve other volumes already to the author 's credit , as enumerated on the reverse of the half-title .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Familiar Letters : English and American '' selected and edited by Professor
Edwin Greenlaw	PERSON	, is a recent addition to the '' Lake Classics '' pub - lished by Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fol - lowing authors are liberally represented : Gray ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	.

		The little volume deserves a warm welcome , for it covers a field that has long awaited from a compiler 's hand just such compe - tent and scholarly treatment as Professor
Greenlaw	PERSON	has here succeeded in giving it .

		Students of mediaeval literature will welcome from the workshop of that distinguished scholar , Professor
Gollancz	PERSON	, a new edition of '' The Parle - ment of the Three Ages '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For this interesting fourteenth-century alliterative poem dealing with the `` nine worthies , '' the editor has provided full critical apparatus .

		But , more than that , he has made accessible almost for the first time the fullest mediaeval treatment of the eternally popular subject of heroes .

		We are especially grateful when we can have such attractive printing of mediaeval texts .

		Several of the prominent educators of the country have contributed interesting and valuable papers to '' Readings in Vocational Guidance '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Meyer Bloomfield	PERSON	.

		As a convenient handbook of the best thought on the subject , the volume will probably be found indis - pensable to those interested .

		In the preface , Mr.
Bloomfield	PERSON	defines vocational guidance as '' organized common sense used to help each indi - vidual make the most of his abilities and oppor - tunities . ''

		The need for this organized common sense has been revealed either in the frequent fail - ure of youth to supply the required initiative to work out the beginnings of a successful future or in the failure of society to present the proper sur - roundings in which it can be done .

		Even a casual reading of this book suggests that our '' organized common sense '' has been strenuously directed toward correcting the first of the two evils .

		Per - haps danger lurks there .

		We are so intent on shaping the peg to fit it into the square hole , that , to drop the figure , we may fail to emphasize the greater need of reconstruction of our industrial system so that it will meet , more fully and more generously , the varying demands of the indi - vidual . ''

		Those who are stricken with great misfortunes often suffer intensely from the lack of sympathetic imagination in those who are about them . ''

		Thus writes , most truthfully , Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	in the opening piece of '' The Blinded Soldiers and Sail - ors Gift Book '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which has an occasional word that , like Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	's observation , ought to shame us out of our wonted cheerfulness over others ' ills .

		Mr.
George Goodchild	PERSON	edits and sympathetically prefaces this collection of prose and verse signed -LRB- in facsimile -RRB- with such eminent names as
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	,
John Galsworthy	PERSON	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	,
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	,
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	,
Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler	PERSON	,
Beatrice Harraden	PERSON	,
Austin Dobson	PERSON	,
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, and others , to the number of nearly two score .

		Illustrations by distinguished artists are interspersed , and
Milton	PERSON	's two sonnets -LRB- XIX and XXI -RRB- on his blindness appropriately close the book .

		By a curious error , the frontis - piece , which might be a street scene in ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' with crinolined women as the chief figures , and hardly a man in sight , is labelled '' The Blinded Soldier . ''

		Of varying excellence and on widely varying themes are these gratuitous contributions ; but surely the purpose of the volume the for - warding of the good work at
St. Dunstan	ORGANIZATION	's in helping the blinded war-victims to help themselves should procure for it a good sale .

Feb. 17	DATE	Sir
Clements Robert Markham	PERSON	, former president of the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, died at his home in the suburbs of
London	LOCATION	on
January 30	DATE	, after a long life devoted to travel and geographical re - search .

		He served in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	from
1844	DATE	to
1852	DATE	.

		Thereupon followed travels in
Peru	LOCATION	which led to the introduction into British
India	LOCATION	of the cultiva - tion of quinine-yielding cinchona trees from
Peru	LOCATION	.

		He edited twenty-two volumes for the
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	, of which he was secretary for several years .

		His writings include histories of
Peru	LOCATION	, Thibet , and the Abyssinian Expedition ; biogra - phies of
Lord Fairfax	LOCATION	,
Columbus	LOCATION	, Major Rennell ,
Richard III	PERSON	, and Sir
Leopold M'Clintock	PERSON	; and several records of his travels in
Peru	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		At the recent public meeting of the
Academy of Inscriptions	ORGANIZATION	and
Belles Lettres	PERSON	of the
Institute of France	ORGANIZATION	, its learned President ,
M. Edouard Cha	PERSON	- vannes , paid this tribute , in his annual address , to a distinguished foreign correspondent of the Acad - emy , an American who passed away last year : ''
William Woodville Rockhill	PERSON	, qui f ut ministre des Etats-Unis a Peking , ambassadeur en Russie puis a
Constantinople	LOCATION	, fut , en meme temps qu'un diplo - mate de grande envergure , un explorateur et un philologue ; ses voyages au

''

		The
Cervantes Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	has an at - tractive name , which is a valuable asset to any commercial house .

		Its recent incorporation and establishment in
New York	LOCATION	for the publication of Spanish books may be regarded as another sign of our increasing interest in the language and liter - ature of the people whose name and achievements hold so prominent a place in the history of the western continent .

		The chief concern of the new publishing house will be the yearly issue of '' El Anuario Universal , '' or `` Universal Yearbook , '' devoted , we infer , to Spanish-American interests .

		First-hand information in commercial , political , and statistical matters will be sought from the governments of the countries concerned , and thus it is hoped to make the publication as nearly accu - rate as human fallibility will permit .

		The incor - porators are newspaper men , Mr.
L. J. de Bekker	PERSON	is president of the company , and its headquarters are at 20 Vesey Street .


John Townsend Trowbridge	PERSON	, poet and author of stories for boys , died at his home in
Arlington	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, on the 12th inst .

		He was in his ninetieth year .

		Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	was born in
Monroe County	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		In
1847	DATE	he removed to
New York City	LOCATION	, and began to write for '' The Knickerbocker Maga - zine '' and other periodicals .

		The following year he went to
Boston	LOCATION	, where he later became a promi - nent member of the literary group in that city .

		He was one of the earliest contributors to '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' and was a contributor and for a time editor of '' Our Young Folks , '' a periodical later merged with '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	. ''

		His first book , '' Father Brighthopes , '' appeared in
1856	DATE	.

		During a journey abroad in
1855	DATE	Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	wrote his novel of
New England	LOCATION	life entitled '' Neighbor Jackwood , '' which achieved great popularity upon its publication
two years later	DATE	.

		Of his numerous boys ' books , ''
Jack Hazard	PERSON	and His Fortunes , '' `` Cudjo 's Cave , '' `` The Scarlet Tanager , '' and '' The Fortunes of Toby Trafford '' are among the best known . ''

		The Vagabonds , and Other Poems , '' published in
1869	DATE	, established Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	's reputation as a poet ; another volume of verse , '' The Emigrant 's Story , and Other Poems , '' ap - peared in
1875	DATE	.

		For the past half century or more , Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	made his home on the bor - ders of
Spy Pond	LOCATION	, in
Arlington	LOCATION	, a suburb of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		His autobiography , '' My Own Story , with Recollections of Noted Persons , '' was pub - lished in
1903	DATE	.

		A versatile literary craftsman pays for the vari - ety of his aptitudes by attaining pre-eminence in no one branch of literature .

		So it was with the amazingly productive
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; and so it has proved again with one who is often spoken of as
Lang	PERSON	's rival in the field of fairy tales , the gifted and scholarly Dr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, who died at Yon - kers on the 30th of
January	DATE	.

		He was born at
Syd	PERSON	- ney ,
New South Wales	LOCATION	,
Aug. 29 , 1854	DATE	, and finished his schooling at
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	.

		His first visit to this country was in
1896	DATE	, and it was ten years later that the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	made him a Doctor of Letters .

		As scholar , jour - nalist , lecturer , translator , compiler , editor , ency - clopedist , and miscellaneous writer , he has made himself known and valued in both
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Jewish history was his specialty , so far as his restlessly inquiring mind permitted him to have one , and perhaps his most scholarly achieve - ment was the editorship , or co-editorship , of the `` Jewish Encyclopaedia '' published by
Funk	ORGANIZATION	and
Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	.

		While in
England	LOCATION	he was made Presi - dent of the Jewish Historical Society and Secretary of the
Russo-Jewish Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		He edited '' The Jewish Year Book '' and '' The American Hebrew . ''

		His best-known books include '' Studies in Jewish Statistics , '' `` English Fairy Tales , '' `` Celtic Fairy Tales , '' `` The Jews of Angevin England , '' `` More English Fairy Tales , '' '' Studies in Biblical Archae - ology , '' '' ^ sop 's Fables , '' '' Jewish Ideals , '' '' Liter - ary Studies , '' '' Wonder Voyages , '' and '' The Story of Geographical Discovery .

March	DATE	IN THE MARCH FORUM HUTCHINS HAPGOOD HAS AN ARTICLE PROHIBITION In which he says : `` The cause of temperance is the cause of civilization .

		The cause of prohibition indicates an underlying fanaticism which is never present in the most enlightened communities . ''

		It is a remarkably sane consideration of one of the problems that troubles the world whether in war or peace , and examination of the question from a new viewpoint the effect of prohibition not the effect of alcohol on character and social customs and the way men live their lives .

		HUTCHINS HAPGOOD is neither a `` wet '' nor a `` dry . ''

		But he is a very human sociologist , interested , as his books attest , in discovering the things that make life richer in human values .

		And he says , frankly , as always , what he thinks of prohibition and prohibi - tionists , and the saloon , and the economic aspects of liquor-drinking .

		It is a wise and far-see - ing view of a problem every state in

		224 THE PERSIAN INFLUENCE ON EUROPEAN LITERATURE .

		An American who has grown immensely rich was wont to remark , toward the begin - ning of his career , that he never felt quite comfortable unless he owed a few million dol - lars .

		It is that way with literature .

		Few literatures become great until they have caught up , '' conveyed , '' absorbed a vast deal of thought and art from foreign or distant sources .

		Take English literature .

		In the Elizabethan age the classical renaissance and the Italianate influence were all in all .

		Then , owing to the translation of the
Bible	LOCATION	, to the Reformation , and to
Milton	LOCATION	, Hebrew thought was dominant , and for a time the English people were hardly more than a tribe of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		Every man was a lonely prophet , and any neighbor who differed by a shade of opin - ion with him was a son of Belial .

		Then the gay and social spirit of
France	LOCATION	leaped upon the English stage , and literature became witty and shallow and conventional .

		And so it has gone on down to the present day .

		Looking at English literature in the large , one would say that its body has been nourished by a most minute half - pennyworth of native bread and a most unconscionable quantity of imported sack .

		This being so , one might wonder , by way of parenthesis , at the stock attitude of En - glish critics toward American literary work .

		They always insist that we shall spin our web out of our own bodies .

		`` All we want from you , '' they practically tell us , `` is the rustic murmur of your burgs , your backwoods mannerisms : we will attend to the large world - transactions in literature . ''

		This feeling ex - plains their instant acceptance of all our oddities and so-called originals , and their cold regard for our greatest men .


Andrew Lang	PERSON	, in his book on English Literature , finds that
Poe	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	have grown too rich and great trading on borrowed capital , so he brushes them all to one side and sets up our excellent but not very poetic
Whittier	LOCATION	in first place .

		Now literary material belongs to him who can use it .

		`` We see no reason why 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	American writers should not follow the exam - ple of their European cousins and scour the world for inspiration or conquest . ''

		Home - keeping youths have ever homely wits , '' says
Shakespeare	PERSON	; and we fancy this is true of authors and artists .

		But we must get down to our subject , which is the not well made out or much thought of influence of Persian literature on
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We all recognize our overwhelming debt to
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Latterly some account has been made of the riches we have received from
Hindu	LOCATION	, Scandinavian , and Celtic civilizations .

		But the argosies that floated to us from Per - sia and Arabia have hardly been kept track of in our literary custom-houses .

		Just to show what may have happened , it is asserted that one of the earliest migrations to
Ireland	LOCATION	was from
Persia	LOCATION	. ''

		Erin '' could easily be corrupted from ''
Iran	LOCATION	. ''

		An ingenious Irish author wrote a book to prove that the Round Towers were built by and for the use of Persian Fire-Worshippers .

		And an Italian writer has traced the legend of Tristan and Isolde to Persian sources .

		But the question of origins is a baffling one .

		For aught that is really known , the whole human race may have come from that `` high mountain cradle in Pamere . ''

		The largest known influence which has emanated from
Persia	LOCATION	is that of the
Zoroas	PERSON	- trian religion the dualism of Good and Evil , of Ormuzd and Ahriman .

		It is a dwin - dled worship at home ; but it put its stamp on Hebrew thought , and hence on Christianity .

		It has put its stamp also on the latest philos - ophy of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		To the Greeks ,
Persia	LOCATION	was a thing of awe and wonder .

		They were always in opposition to the huge
State	ORGANIZATION	, but always fascinated by it .

		The Great King loomed in their eyes some - what as the
Grand Monarque	LOCATION	did in the eyes of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The Greek leaders , driven from home by their ungrateful countrymen , found refuge with him .

		`` Woe for
Miltiades	PERSON	, sup - pliant at
Persia	LOCATION	's court ; woe for
Themistocles	LOCATION	, satrap of
Persia	LOCATION	's king . ''

		A great part of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and
Xenophon	PERSON	is devoted to Per - sia .

		Conversely , however , there seems to have been no return of interest in Greek civiliza - tion , even though
Alexander	PERSON	overran the great empire .

		Mr.
Edward G. Browne	PERSON	, in his `` Literary History of
Persia	LOCATION	, '' quotes assent - ingly the dictum of Noldeke : `` Hellenism never touched more than the surface of Per - sian life , but
Iran	LOCATION	was penetrated to the core by Arabian religion and Arabian ways . ''

		For many centuries before , during , and after the crusades , a good part of
Europe	LOCATION	sat up of nights shuddering at the menace of the Moslem power .

		Mahmud and the Soldari must have been almost dominant figures of fear and hatred .

		The epics and legends of the middle ages , the
Song of Roland	ORGANIZATION	, the Song of the Cid , the books of Knight Errantry reveal this preoccupation , as do the later epics of
Ariosto	PERSON	and
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here again , however , the influence was one of opposition rather than acceptance .

		It was probably not until the publication of
Antoine Galland	PERSON	's translation of '' The Ara - bian Nights , '' in 1704-17 , that
Persia	LOCATION	as a literary influence is to be reckoned with .

		The result was shown immediately in the '' Lettres persanes '' of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	, published in
1721	DATE	.

		Montesquieu brought his Persians to
Europe	LOCATION	to comment ironically on its civilization , and other writers followed in the same vein .

		Per - sian tales and apologues appeared in the mis - cellany prints both in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.


William Collins	PERSON	's '' Persian Eclogues '' show the force of the new current , though there is not much that is Persian about them .

		Vol - taire and
Dryden	PERSON	brought
Persia	LOCATION	upon the stage .

		Eastern Sultans and Sultanesses , in turbans and waving plumes , were admired ;
Roxana	PERSON	and
Statira	PERSON	were two of the most successful tragedy queens of the time .

		Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	travelled to the
East	LOCATION	and lived there some time .

		Then there was apparently a long lull of interest in things Persian .

		The East , with its enchantments , waited to be rediscovered .

		Beckford , in his `` History of the Caliph Vathek , '' did rediscover and recreate it ; but his book was too grim and great to be popu - lar , or to turn men 's thoughts to the regions of its scene .

		It was not until
Byron	PERSON	made his first pilgrimage to
Greece	LOCATION	and , on returning to
England	LOCATION	, published `` The Giaour '' in
1813	DATE	, and followed it up by a quick succession of poems , '' The Corsair , '' '' Siege of
Corinth	LOCATION	, '' '' Mazeppa , '' the Greek scenes of ''
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' that the East of mystery and magic , of `` fierce wars and faithful loves , '' of lawless action , was burned in upon the European mind .

		Tom
Moore	PERSON	is said to have planned his `` Lalla Rookh '' before
Byron	PERSON	's publiea -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 193 tions , but it did not see the light until
1817	DATE	.

		If there is any truth in the early migration of Persian Fire - Worshippers , the Formorians .

		to
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	's interest in this material is a curious reversion to type .

		Scott adventured into the East in '' The Talisman '' and in his last good novel , '' Count Robert of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		To continue the tale of Persian influence in
England	LOCATION	, there is
Tennyson	LOCATION	's `` Recollections of the Arabian Nights , '' which sums up the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	impression of the Orient .

		Then there is
Clarence Siangan	PERSON	's fiery * '
Karaman	PERSON	, '' and two or three other poems which are per - haps even more vital in their rendering of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	character and scenery .

		Kinglake 's ''
Eothen	ORGANIZATION	'' is an excellent book of travel , which had a great vogue in its day .

		And above all there is
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's translation or recreation of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	.

		Many of Omar 's quatrains are doubtfully attributed to him in his own literature : each one of them is a separate poem , and the arrangement by which
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	made a fairly connected dis - course of a hundred or so of them , thereby adding immensely to the effect , is unknown to the originals .

		And
FitzGerald	PERSON	used the ut - most liberty to cut down , weld together , or interpolate .

		Omar does not rank among the greatest Persian poets : and as the English version has taken place with the best English poetry , we are forced to conclude that
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	must have put into it about as much as he found .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Sohrab and Rustum '' and '' The Sick King in
Bokhara	LOCATION	'' are of
Persia	LOCATION	: and Sir
Francis Doyle	PERSON	's '' Red Thread of Honor , '' one of the greatest of English war lyrics , deals with a Persian custom .

		The Germans had a '' follow on '' in dealing with the
East	LOCATION	.

		The writing of Goethe 's '' West-Ostlicher Divan '' dates from
1814	DATE	, though it did not appear until four or five years later .

		Goethe had written a fragment of a '' Mohammed '' early in life , but it is hard to believe that his new interest in the
East	LOCATION	was not due to
Byron	PERSON	's example .

		Platen , whose '' Ghaselen '' appeared in
1821	DATE	.

		certainly followed in the track of both .

		Riick - ert 's ''
Ostliche Rosen	PERSON	'' came out in
1822	DATE	, and '' Freiligrath '' was much later .

		Heine , who probably more than any modern reproduces the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	type of poet Hafiz or
Saadi	LOCATION	, dealt but sparingly with Persian or Moslem themes .

		His Orient was
Syria	LOCATION	or
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The French , too , lagged after the English in the new exploitation of the
East	LOCATION	.


Victor Hugo	PERSON	's `` Les orientates '' appeared in
1829	DATE	.

		What is the value of Persian literature in itself ?

		We are waiting for some authorita - tive critic to come forward and tell us .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's magnificent `` Literary History of
Persia	LOCATION	'' gives us all the data and much excel - lent translation , but the author is too modest definitely to judge the work he deals with or to submit it to comparative criticism .

		He objects to the '' Shahnamah , '' and we agree with him that it is not a true epic .

		It is a gigantic chronicle of kings and heroes , whose record extends over many centuries .

		It has not the single action and interest that the even more gigantic epic poems of
India	LOCATION	have , and it seems to have little of the concentrated art of the European epics .

		Single episodes , notably that of Sohrab and Rustum , are fine .

		There are a number of Arabian narrative poems which have an immense reputation in the
East	LOCATION	, and which probably have a real evolution and concinnity .

		Neither
Persia	LOCATION	nor Arabia seems to have produced any great dramatic poetry .

		The Persian Passion Play , which deals with the sufferings of the de - scendants of Ali .

		is a national work ; and the race must have other dramatic performances , but they have not risen on our Western eyes .

		The great mass of Persian literature consists of lyric and gnomic poetry and tales .

		Unless lyric poetry meets with an inspired transla - tor such as
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, it is likely to remain sealed up in its own language .

		Perhaps Per - sia 's best gift to the world has been the short story .

		This was perfected first in the
East	LOCATION	, and the myriad of splendid specimens in - cluded in '' The Arabian Nights '' have had a vast popularity and influence in the modern world .

		The Spirit of the
East	LOCATION	, what is there that distinguishes and differentiates it from the genius loci of any other region ?

		It certainly has not the measure , the perfect taste , of the guardian of Greek life .

		It has not the holi - ness , the sanctity , of the Hebrew angel , or the goodness and unworldliness of the Hindu one .

		It is , in fact , thoroughly worldly , but fierce , intractable , fatalistic .

		It is wild , bizarre , extravagant , in its imaginations .

		It has wanted either supremacy or a haughty isolation .

		As the Caliph Omar thought the Koran the only necessary book , so the whole 194 -LSB-
March 2	DATE	race has been wrapped up in its own achieve - ments .

		Except in philosophy , it has accepted no intellectual influence from without .

		Its cities , always the abodes of unparalleled lux - ury , rise on the edge of the desert .

		It is diffi - cult to say whether they or the mirage pictures beyond them are the more unreal .

		MR. SAINTS - BURY AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY .

		THE POET-LAUREATE 'S ANTHOLOGY .

		A VERSATILE WRITER .

		MR.
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	'S NEW NOVEL .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A modern author seldom remembers how many collaborators he has .

		But we are now being unpleasantly reminded that amongst these are men in shirt-sleeves who cut down trees in the forests of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, merchants in the Norwegian and Swedish ports , and sail - ors who traverse the heaving gray wastes of the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		In short , the price of paper is going up .

		For obvious reasons the price of paper , like that of every other commodity , began mounting as soon as the war broke out .

		But recently the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has been mak - ing ever-heavier demands upon the mercantile marine for the transport of troops and sup - plies ; and the report that
Sweden	LOCATION	contem - plates limiting her export of wood-pulp reaches us almost simultaneously with the news that the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	is prepar - ing a scheme whereunder our newspapers will have to submit to an all-round reduction in the supplies of paper allotted to them .

		Even before this , one heard of contracts for paper at twice the pre-war prices ; the paper - makers -LRB- or rather the middlemen through whom they mostly deal -RRB- have been refusing to supply customers with more than enough for their current needs ; and one publisher com - plains to me that he has been buying for con - siderable sums masses of old paper of odd sizes , and that he is issuing his books not in the sizes he would choose for them but in sizes determined by the paper he finds avail - able .

		But suppose the authorities extend to the publishing trade -LRB- as it is alleged they are thinking of doing -RRB- the forty or fifty per cent reduction of supplies that it is suggested may be imposed upon the newspapers ?

		I do not know what real likelihood there is of this hap - pening ; but if it does , there must obviously be an immense reduction in the number of books issued .

		Newspapers can cut down from ten pages to six .

		But a publisher can not get all his authors to truncate their works in order that the number of `` titles '' in his list shall be as pre-arranged .

		If it comes to this , we shall feel that the war 's failure to evoke a large mass of good literature has , after all , been for the best !

		It would be too distressing if the country were brimming over with mas - terpieces which could not be printed owing to the shortage of ships for the Scandinavian traffic !

		Meanwhile , to do them justice , the publish - ers have been '' doing their bit . ''

		The statis - tics of last year 's book-production show that , although the number of books published was smaller than that in any year since
1907	DATE	, there were still over 10,000 new works and new edi - tions , exclusive of pamphlets and such small deer .

		The unfortunate thing is that de - creases are recorded principally in the various departments of serious literature ; even books of verse , in spite of the war-poets and the many gallant efforts of lyrical subalterns , fell off considerably in number .

		This year the drop -LRB- leaving the paper question out of ac - count -RRB- will be heavier in all probability , as most of the old contracts will have been ful - filled by now , and publishers have been chary of making new ones since war broke out .

		Mr. he is no longer Professor
George Saintsbury	PERSON	loses none of his energy with age ; and in his new volume , '' The Peace of the Augustans , '' he lets out at the modernists and at the decriers of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	as Friar
John	PERSON	did at the Picrocholians when he hurried upon them `` so rudely , without cry - ing gare or beware , that he overthrew them like hogs , tumbled them over like swine , strik - ing athwart and alongst , and by one means or other so laid about him , after the old fashion of fencing , that to some he beat out their brains , to others he crushed their arms , bat - tered their legs , and bethwacked their sides till their ribs cracked with it . ''

		One rather feels however , that some of his victims are Aunt Sallies of his own construction .

		The
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	is not a lost cause .

		It was out of fashion when it was old-fashioned ; it is in fashion again now it is antique .

		It was natural that the early Romantics should have been exasperated with those who thought Pope a stupendous poet and the regular couplet the last word in form ; but sneers at Pope are not common to-day .

		He is read and appreciated for what he was : a great wit , a great satirist , a consummate craftsman , who showed occasional gleams of the highest kind of poetic gift .

		Is Fielding neglected , or Smol - lett , or
Johnson	PERSON	,
Addison	PERSON	, Gray ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Horace Walpole	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Gibbon	PERSON	, or Swift ?

		On the contrary ; in recent years as much
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 195 serious criticism must have been devoted to the Georgians as to the Elizabethans , and many men have even -LRB- to this kind of effort Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's writings have been a great stimulus -RRB- spent a good deal of time nosing about among the minor
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	poets Shenstone ,
Lady Winchilsea	LOCATION	,
Dyer	PERSON	for fragments of the real thing .

		That the ;
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	was a great lyric age , i and an age principally addicted to intense ; observation of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is a paradox that will never be established ; but the last generation , of critics has done a great deal to modify the old conception of a sudden transition from poetry to prose and back from prose to poetry again .

		And the major figures in
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	literature , its novelists , satirists , his - torians , and letter - writers , are popular enough now to be beyond the need of ferocious cham - pionship .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	, in spite of his unique style , is always extremely readable , and on old literature he is usually sound ; but he has certain peculiar limitations when he approaches his contemporaries .

		The Poet Laureate 's new anthology , '' The | Spirit of Man , '' is an extraordinarily inter - j esting book .

		To appreciate it properly you have to approach it in the right frame of mind .

		It is not an ordinary anthology of what the compiler thinks the best things in !

		Art .

		It is a purely personal affair .

		It is , !

		says Dr. Bridges in his preface , '' the work of one mind at one time . ''

		He has gone through his library , as it were , with a pencil , marking poems or passages of prose , or even single sentences , in which he finds spiritual suste - nance .

		He has , where such passages are for - eign , translated them into noble English : he has arranged his extracts into an ordered scheme .

		To be true to himself and his idea he had to take every kind of liberty .

		Many great writers -LRB- there is no extract , for instance , from the prose of
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	, or from the poetry of
Vaughan	PERSON	-RRB- are omitted entirely be - cause Dr. Bridges does not find in them -LRB- though others may -RRB- that essence for which he is searching .

		He will include , on the other hand , a poem like `` La Belle Dame Sans Merci , '' which , one imagines , no one before him ever thought of reading as an allegory of eternal things .

		He will take a fine poem of Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	's and cut it short in the middle ; extract a bare two lines from a long modern poem ; and reinsert in Gray 's '' Elegy '' lines that the poet himself dropped .

		What is one man 's food is another man 's tedium ; and not everyone will find in all Dr. Bridges 's extracts the quality he finds in them himself .

		But it is one of the most fascinating anthologies we have had , and it will certainly -LRB- besides fulfilling its ostensible purpose -RRB- do a good deal for the reputations of certain neg - lected writers like
Gerard Hopkins	PERSON	.

		Every considerable modern author has books written about him ; and the boom Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	has had as a commentator on the war has induced two young critics , Messrs.
Creighton Mandell	PERSON	and
Edward Shanks	PERSON	, to write the first monograph on him .

		They have not done their panegyric by halves .

		Theirs is a small book ; and it would appear that , with space restricted , they have thought fit to leave out everything but the superlatives .

		But it is an error of the right sort , in this case and at this time .

		Belloc has not yet had his due here ; and I believe I may be mistaken that he has had very much less than his due on your side .

		The growth of his reputa - tion has been impeded by his very versatility .

		A friend of his protested years ago that '' Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	Is a ease for legislation ad hoc , He seems to think nobody minds His books being all of different kinds . ''

		And if a man will write biographies , histories , novels , travel-books , essays , studies in the Art of War , volumes of propagandist politics , and poems of all sorts , he can not expect many of his contemporaries to get a comprehensive view of his work .

		Whatever he is writing , too , he suppresses none of his interests or faculties ; and it is possible that readers who take his books singly find too much of the novelist in his political and historical works and too much politics and history in - his fictions .

		Over-hasty production has made much of his writing less good than it might be .

		If he had written no more than `` Dan - ton , '' `` Emmanuel Burden '' -LRB- the most suc - cessful satire ever written on a certain sort of Imperialism -RRB- , `` The Path to
Rome	LOCATION	, '' `` The Four Men , '' `` Cautionary Tales , '' `` Verses , '' '' Hills and the Sea / ' and '' On Nothing , '' six monographs would probably have been writ - ten on him by this time .

		I notice that even the enthusiastic Messrs.
Mandell	PERSON	and
Shanks	PERSON	shrink from the task of constructing a Bibli - ography .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's new novel , '' The
Brook Kerith	PERSON	, '' will appear in the early
summer	DATE	.

		An edition de luxe will be issued simultaneously with the other an unusual thing with a new novel .

		But it is an unusual novel .

		It deals with the
Founder of Christianity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has adopted the theory that Jesus survived crucifixion , and was stolen away alive by
Joseph	PERSON	of Arimathea ; then joining a settle - ment of Essenes in the valley of the
Brook Kerith	PERSON	, a spot selected by Mr.
Moore	PERSON	after an exhaustive personal inspection of the Holy 196 -LSB-
March 5	DATE	Land .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has not hitherto distin - guished himself in the field of historical ro - mance , except when he has been romancing about his own history .

		Whether he has made a success of this tour de force remains to be seen .

		But the mere avoidance of the stilted and Mr.
Moore	PERSON	could write about Moses himself as if he were his own contemporary will be a novelty in a book dealing with so remote a period in time ; and his refreshing and habitual avoidance of the obvious may be illustrated by the fact that the story opens with an elaborate description of the home - life of
Joseph	PERSON	of Arimathea when a boy .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN
POLAND	LOCATION	has , with many other kinds of freedom in that afflicted land , long been conspicuous by its absence .

		If present conditions at
Warsaw	LOCATION	are as repre - sented by a correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' and are more than tempo - rary , there is reason to rejoice .

		Dr.
R. J. Oberfohren	PERSON	writesV '' The opening of a
Polish University	ORGANIZATION	in
Warsaw	LOCATION	in the
last months of the past year	DATE	has not found the echo in neu - tral countries that could justly have been expected .

		A national university was the ful - filment of one of the dearest wishes of the Polish people .

		Under the Russian regime the
Warsaw University	ORGANIZATION	was sorely oppressed .

		All lectures had to be given in Russian , Polish professors were few in number and under constant supervision , while the majority of professors and instructors were Russians .

		The students could only be admitted by Gov - ernmental warrant , had to wear a kind of uniform , and had strict orders to use the Rus - sian language both in private and public ... In the new university all lectures are given in the Polish tongue , by teachers of recognized standing in the Polish w r orld of science .

		There are no restrictions for the students in regard to descent or creed .

		Full academic liberty , one of the finest fruits of German thought and civilization , is granted and ap - preciated by both professors and students ... '' That sounds hopeful , certainly ; but whence does the re-opened university draw its vigor - ous and promising young students , or even its able-bodied professors , in these days ?

		And even the lauded German academic freedom , though
Germany	LOCATION	has no
Siberia	LOCATION	for students and professors of too liberal or otherwise independent tendencies , is not quite all that could be desired .

		There are other ways of fettering thought and its expression than b > the knout and the prison cell .

		Nevertheless it does seem a change for the better that thii Polish institution of learning has undergone whatever may prove to be the thoroughness and permanence of that change .

		A NOVELIST-LIBRARIAN , or librarian-novelist whichever of the hyphenated functions hi most prides himself upon , issues an unusually interesting record of yearly progress ii library work , in the `` Report of the Chilli cothe ,

1915	DATE	circulation was nearly 85,000 , whicl would be an incredible figure if it were no1 for the county work that for the past thret years has been added to the library 's citj work .

		In respect to character the circulatioi shows some notable features .

		Fiction , as this novelist-librarian points out with satisfaction though without derogatory implication as tc the dignity and worth of this class of litera ture , enjoyed no monopoly of favor with tht readers , its circulation amounting to bu1 forty-five per cent of the total a remarkably low figure in public-library statistics .

		But ii should be added that juvenile fiction is nol included in this reckoning ; with that taken into account , the percentage mounts to sev - enty , not so astonishing though still credita - ble .

		That a writer of imaginative literature can at the same time be practical in even the small details of library economy becomes evi - dent more than once in the course of this report .

		For instance , in order to keep within bounds the increasing expense for re-binding , Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	established a repair shop in the basement , where '' up to the present time 1250 books have been recased with the use of flexi - ble glue .

		These books are wearing splendidly , the process costs only about
two cents	MONEY	a book , and it looks as though the binding problem
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 197 had been solved . ''

		To be at once a successful librarian and also the author of popular nov - els that circulate both in English -LRB- perhaps in other modern languages as well -RRB- and , in one instance , in Latin -LRB- `` Mysterium Arcae Boule '' -RRB- ought to bring to a reasonable man some measure of content even in this world of unsatisfied longings and unrealized ambitions .

		MR.
TROWBRIDGE	PERSON	'S SUCCESSFUL PLAYS , nota - bly '' Neighbor Jackwood , '' ''
Cudjo	PERSON	's Cave , '' and '' Coupon Bonds , '' are called to mind at this time in connection with their author 's death .

		Though making no pretensions to great dramatic merit , these stage pieces , adapted in two instances by Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	himself , with some professional assistance , from his stories , furnished wholesome amuse - ment and were much in favor with amateur companies .

		Vividly can we recall the inno - cent delights of `` Coupon Bonds '' as pre - sented by non-professional players .

		That was longer ago than one likes to say .

		and carries one back almost to Civil War days , when the story was written to promote the cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	by encouraging its supporters to invest in the government 's newly issued securities of the coupon-bond variety .

		Almost half a cen - tury ago the author made his first decided hit as a playwright with '' Neighbor Jackwood '' -LRB- from the novel of the same name -RRB- on the stage of the
Boston Museum	ORGANIZATION	.


March 16 , 1857	DATE	, was the date , and he himself has described his sensations on seeing the billboard announce - ment , '' Tremendous Hit !

		!

		Received with Thunders of Applause !

		!

		! ''

		This was on the very first evening , when he was on his way to attend the opening performance .

		But there seems to have been little exaggeration in these staring headlines , as the piece had a run of three weeks to crowded houses and was a favorite with the Museum public for eight j years thereafter . ''

		Cudjo 's Cave '' was drama - I tized by some unknown hand and first pro- j duced at the
Howard Athenaeum	PERSON	, without the sanction of author or publisher : but a loop - hole in the copyright law r enabled the offender to escape punishment .

		These good old plays are now shelved and must be enjoyed , if at all , in reminiscence and in perusal , if indeed the time-stained , yellow-covered little pieces are still procurable .

		A MUCH ABUSED PUBLISHING TERM COmeS to every city-dweller 's attention every day and j usually many times a day .

		It is the word ! ''

		edition . ''

		The '' Daily Megaphone '' appears ' at early dawn in an '' extra edition , '' at nine o'clock in an '' evening edition , '' at eleven in a '' 6.30 edition , '' and before noon has struck it may have issued its '' midnight edition '' or some other absurdly entitled impression of its slightly altered reading-matter .

		The French newspaper is issued to-day in an edition dated to-morrow , and containing the news of yester - day ; and this practice is familiar in other European countries .

		In the department of book-publication the word '' edition '' has long been subject to notorious abuse .

		With some publishers the term '' tenth edition '' or '' twentieth edition '' may mean no more than that the presses have been stopped long enough , in printing the first thousand or fewer copies , to insert these words in the title - page ; with others it may have more signifi - cance , perhaps even meaning `` tenth thou - sand '' or `` twentieth thousand , '' as the case may be .

		But in general the word so sadly abused rarely signifies anything of more im - portance than '' impression '' or '' printing . ''

		Complaints of the inaccuracy have been fre - quent , and several attempts have been made to arrive at some uniformity of usage in the matter ; but the difficulties are obvious .

		The distinction between '' impression , '' '' edition , '' and `` re-issue , '' as tentatively formulated by the
Publishers ' Association of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	is as follows : `` IMPRESSION : A number of copies printed at any one time .

		When a book is reprinted without change , it should be called a new impression , to distinguish it from an edition as defined below .

		EDITION : An impression in which the matter has undergone some change , or for which the type has been reset .

		RE-ISSUE : A republication at a differ - ent price , or in a different form , of part of an impression which has already been placed on the market . ''

		A general observance of these distinctions is something greatly to be desired .

		A CRABBE REVIVAL showed signs , about ten years ago , of getting itself started and of acquiring some degree of momentum .

		It was in
September , 1905	DATE	, that a number of the
Suffolk	LOCATION	poet 's admirers undertook to rescue his name from an undeserved obscurity if not oblivion by holding a celebration at Aide - burgh , his birthplace .

		This performance came near to being a sesquicentennial observance , since
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	was born a few days before the end of
1754	DATE	.

		Perhaps it had been planned as a sesquieentennial and suffered unavoidable delay .

		However that may have been , no great results followed in the way of making Crabbe a favorite with poetry-lovers .

		Most of us have remained indolently content with such knowl - edge of him as we could get -LRB- in delightful fashion -RRB- from
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	's letters and from occasional quoted extracts from the rather voluminous poetical works .

		To 198 THE DIAL -LSB- March 2
Gerald	PERSON	his old neighbor was a most admirable and enjoyable singer of the placid pleasures of English country life .

		And now there comes to notice another appreciative student of `` The Borough , '' `` The Parish Register , '' '' The Library , '' '' The Village , '' '' Tales of the Hall , '' and the rest of the metrical series bear - ing
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's name as author .

		Professor
Laura Johnson Wylie	PERSON	, of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, puts forth a volume of `` Social Studies in English Lit - erature , '' of which `` The England of George Crabbe '' forms not the least entertaining chap - ter .

		Readers of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	are now so few as to render this discovery of a twentieth-century student of the leisurely , long-winded poet a memorable event .

		The only regret is that , while her essay sends one on an eager quest to the nearest library for
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's works , there is not one chance in a score that the library will be found to contain them .

		Books and articles about
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	are procurable in some quantity at any large library , but few such institutions and still fewer bookshops can give you
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	himself the more 's the pity .

		LIBRARIES IN LABRADOR form the subject of an interesting article by Miss
Marian Cutter	PERSON	in `` The Library Journal '' for
February	DATE	.

		The theme might be thought to be about as barren as Snakes in
Ireland	LOCATION	, but pioneer work in establishing library stations and travelling libraries was begun by Miss Cutter and others , - with T -RRB- r.
Grenfell	PERSON	's invaluable cooperation , in the
summer of 1914	DATE	, and from
St. Anthony	LOCATION	, where Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	has his headquarters , many a book has gone out to relieve the monotony and cheer the loneliness of
Labra	LOCATION	- dor life .

		A large room in the St.
Anthony	PERSON	schoolhouse received the collection of books given by various publishing houses and many individuals , and after a month spent in the necessary sorting , classifying , shelf - listing , and other preliminaries known to the profes - sion , the library was ready for use .

		Of course it is a small collection , and the demand for books on the part of those remote fisher folk is already considerable and rapidly increasing as the joy of reading makes itself felt .

		Just how many communities and readers are served at present , and how many travelling libraries are in use , is not stated ; but Dr.
j Grenfell	PERSON	's `` parish '' embraces the Labrador i coast , the Strait Settlements , and all of New - i foundland north of the railway from
Bay of Islands	LOCATION	to
Lewisport	LOCATION	, so that for a long time to come no offering of wholesome literature adapted to simple tastes is likely to go begging for acceptance .

		Juvenile books are especially welcome , and in books for older readers large print is appreciated , as eyes habitually focussed upon distant objects do not readily adapt themselves to the requirements of small print .

		Now that the world has heard of this `` pioneer library work in Labrador , '' it will not be so very surprising to learn of similar activities in
Greenland	LOCATION	.

		There is no geo - graphical limit to the scope of library work .

		THE INCREASED COST OF COLLECTING , whether the collecting be of old masters , of antique furniture , of rare books , or of other objects precious and desirable in the collector 's eyes , has more than kept pace with the increased cost of living ; and for this advance the growing number of wealthy American collec - tors is largely responsible .

		The supply of collectible objects of genuine merit remains , in some departments , nearly constant , in others it is rapidly diminishing , and in few is there any increase at all commensurate with the increasing demand .

		In respect to books , the Director of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, which has been striving against heavy odds to make good its late losses by fire , has this to say : '' , Not only have currently published books shared substantially in that increased cost which has marked luxuries as well as necessaries during the past ten or fifteen years , but older books , those outside the trade and technically known as ' out of print , ' espe - cially of certain kinds , have multiplied in value often many hundredfold .

		Current books and periodicals cost libraries 20 to 25 per cent more than fifteen `` years ago .

		The out of print books , those which must be bought from dealers in special subjects , at auction , in secondhand book shops , from the duplicate stock of libraries , out of garrets , private collections , etc. , have increased in value unreasonably , and out of all relation to the intrinsic value of the book 's contents .

		This is due somewhat to the rapid and con - siderable increase in the number of libraries , but most of all to the vastly greater number of wealthy private collectors whose ardor in the pursuit of rarity or uniqueness creates a price which wholly loses sight of intrinsic value and merely measures the unreasoning , too often the ignorant and undiscriminating emulation of multimillionaires . ''

		Collectors to whom a book 's price is a matter of no moment , men like Mr.
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	and the late
J. Pierpont Morgan	ORGANIZATION	,
Robert Hoe	PERSON	, and
Alfred Henry Huth	PERSON	, have much to answer for to the struggling libraries that are vainly try - ing to fill the gaps in their several special col - lections .

		But , on the other hand , as Mr.
George Watson Cole	PERSON	has recently shown , these millionaire collectors do .

		though chiefly with -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL out any such direct intention , often prove to be , ultimately and usually after their death , the benefactors of public libraries .

		LOVE OF LITERATURE IN THE BLUE GRASS STATE led to the appointment , six years ago , of a
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, which now issues its
Third Biennial Report	ORGANIZATION	, a handsome and in every way creditable document in illustrated pamphlet form , containing sixty-eight pages of interesting information .

		As is stated on the first page , '' the slogan of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	has been ' A library for every county in the
State	ORGANIZATION	and free book service for every citizen . ' ''

		Of course the desired goal still lies far ahead , but that it will some day be reached , and then passed , the present record of progress gives ; encouraging reason to hope .

		Already the travelling-library system embraces nearly as ; many stations as there are days in the year .

		A glance down the list of these stations re - veals some curious names , names that must ; owe their origin in certain instances to senti - ment , in others to a nimble inventive faculty , ; and in still others to chance associations , some - times of a comic nature .

		For example , women 's names are not infrequent , as
Bertha	LOCATION	,
Inez	PERSON	,
Laura	LOCATION	,
Livia	LOCATION	.

		Louisa , and
Nancy	PERSON	; patriotism shows itself in Seventy-Six ; geological pecu - I liarities are seen in Salt Lick ,
Sandlick	LOCATION	, and Paint Lick ; the world 's debt to
Kentucky	LOCATION	in one important respect is recalled by the names ,
Horse Cave	ORGANIZATION	, Long Run .

		and Stamping Ground ; and notable for various reasons are the designations , Alone , Blood ,
Bruin	LOCATION	,
Ceru	PERSON	- lean ,
Eminence	ORGANIZATION	,
Fairplay	LOCATION	.

		Job ,
Lovelaceville	LOCATION	,
Xobob	LOCATION	, Pactolus .

		Pine Knot .

		Savage , and
Spider	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is nothing colorless or com - monplace about these names , nor , we infer , about the people who live in the places so designated and who read the books sent them in the travelling libraries .

		THE CREATOR OF `` DARIUS GREEN AND HIS FLYIXG MACHINE '' probably had not the faintest expectation that before half a century should have passed the invention of the gifted though unfortunate Darius would be per - fected and in daily use , and that it would constitute one of the chief instruments of warfare in a titanic struggle between two groups of great European powers .

		But he lived to see this come to pass .

		Dying recently in his eighty-ninth year .


John Townsend Trowbridge	PERSON	left behind him a bewildering array of literary productions in prose and verse , in narrative , imaginative , dramatic , and poetic composition , in works for the adult reader and stories for the boy and girl , such as can be found credited to hardly another representative of his craft .

		He was born at
Ogden	LOCATION	,
Monroe Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
Sept. 18 , 1827	DATE	; attended the local schools , but was chiefly self-taught ; lived on a farm until he was seventeen years old , then started out to make his way in the world , teaching school in Illi - nois and at
Lockport	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, afterward going to
New York City	LOCATION	and beginning to write for the press , and finally making his way to Bos - ton , which has been the scene of his more important undertakings ever since . ''

		The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' gave publicity to some of his more notable early writings , and '' Our Young Folks , '' which he at one time con - ducted and at all times supported with a variety of successful contributions , could hardly have endured even for its short life - time without his aid .

		His works of fiction , from `` Father Brighthopes '' and `` Martin Merrivale '' to `` A Pair of Madcaps . ''

		make a long list ; his writings in verse were collected , in large part , and published in a substantial volume in
1903	DATE	: and the same year saw the issue of his highly readable autobiography , `` My Own Story , '' wherein his friendships with Whitman ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and many other notable contemporaries , are agree - ably chronicled .

		Not among the greatest of American authors , he is nevertheless among the best loved , and has furnished more whole - some and hearty entertainment in literary form than some that are reckoned his supe - riors .

		He has well and modestly said - of himself : * `` A flower more sacred than far-seen success Perfumes iny solitary path ; I find Sweet compensation in my humbleness .

		And reap the harvest of .

		a quiet mind . ''

		- ... j. .

		STUPID LEGISLATION ABOUT BOOKS is almost as old as books themselves .

		Petty restrictions and ignorant meddlings on the part of law - makers whose interest in literature did not extend beyond ` the daily newspaper have been what the publisher and the book-dealer have had to contend against with what force - of opposition they could command , or to submit to with what patience they could - maintain .

		And now .

		as if it were needed to cap the cli - max of American folly in this class of legisla - tive imbecility , our chief city and the centre of our book-trade has distinguished itself by passing an ordinance placing book-sellers in the same category with pawn-brokers and junk-dealers , requiring of them utterly impos - sible modes of procedure in carrying on their business impossible , that is , if they are to make a living by that business .

		A license , a bond , a suspension of business activity with the going-down of the sun , a careful keeping 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	of records that shall show from whom each book in stock was bought , how much was paid for it , and any further particulars of signifi - cance , also , as some interpret the law , a sim - ilar record of each sale , a strict avoidance of commercial dealings with servants or minors offering books for sale , and a cessation of the practice of visiting customers for the purpose of buying , selling , or appraising books these are some of the grimly amusing features of the new ordinance as scanned by the amazed and indignant dealer in literary wares .

		If sad experience had not taught us wisdom we should be incredulous of the assertion that a supposedly intelligent board of aldermen , not temporarily insane , had sanctioned so ridiculous a piece of tomfoolery , and that a chief magistrate in his right mind had put his name to it .

		Is it surprising that the book interests concerned have entered a vehement protest ?

		A
JANE AUSTEN	PERSON	CENTENARY CELEBRATION is proposed by Mr.
Reginald Farrer	PERSON	, an ardent admirer of that gifted novelist , in a letter to the
London	LOCATION	' '' Times . ''

		It is of course '' the centenary of her immortality , '' as he expresses it , that he wishes to see duly hon - ored .


July 18	DATE	of next year is the hundredth anniversary of her death , and it is suggested that a suitable memorial would be an endow - ment fund for the benefit of those unfor - tunates of her own sex of whom '' she always speaks with a curious and unexplained in - tensity of feeling , '' poor governesses .

		At the same time it is proposed that a centenary edition of her works , including even the least significant and least admirable fragments that have hitherto been spared the pitiless expo - sure of publication , be brought out in sumptu - ous form and with every conceivable editorial accessory , the profits from this edition to go into the poor-governess fund .

		Another cor - respondent approves the suggestion of a definitive edition of the novels , but is not responsive to the appeal on behalf of the poor governess .

		Instead of the proposed fund , he would have the house where Miss
Austen	PERSON	died , in
Winchester	LOCATION	, turned into a
Jane Austen	PERSON	museum for the preservation of
Jane Austen	PERSON	relics and souvenirs of all sorts .

		There is ample time for weighing all suggestions and choosing the best and most feasible , though a more unfortunate season than the present for obtaining subscriptions to the end in view could hardly be imagined .

		Perhaps the pecuniary burden might more easily be borne by the American admirers of Miss
Austen	PERSON	than by her English followers ; but are there many in this country who even so much as open a book of hers once a year ?

		There may be .

		Perhaps time and the correspondence col - umns of the public press will ' tell .

		TOLSTOY 'S LATER DIARIES , now preserved in the Historical Museum at
Moscow	LOCATION	, throw so much light on his mental and spiritual devel - opment in the closing years of his life tkat it is good news to learn that his disciple and friend , Mr.
V. G. Chertkov	PERSON	, is editing these records for publication , and that volume one , covering the years 1895-99 , has already been issued at
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		A cursory view of its con - tents has appeared in the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' literary supplement , from which it is evident that much of the deeply reflective man Tolstoy ingenuously portrays itself in the pages of the diary , but that very little of the externalities of his life gains admittance to those pages .

		To them he has recourse '' like a penitent to the confessional , that he may unburden himself of his backslidings , his fail - ures to endure with patience the whips and scorns of life .

		There is something strangely lovable in his unflinching candour and humil - ity . ''

		Not in any sense a new Tolstoy , it seems , does this intimate diary reveal , nor was such revelation expected or desired ; but a fuller and clearer delineation of the
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	already known to and loved by his readers does appear to be presented , despite the inevi - table censoring and editing , the selecting and the discarding , that preceded the publication of such parts of these personal memorials as are now seeing the light .

		An early appear - ance of the work in an English dress is to be hoped for and expected .

		THE FUNCTION OF FICTION , as well expressed by Sir
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, is primarily to interest , and the fiction-writer has `` some claim to hope that if he can but interest his readers he fulfills the chief end of man in leaving others a little happier than he found them . ''

		But like all desirable ends it is not to be attained without a struggle . ''

		The life of a writer of fiction has its own troubles , '' asserts the same authority , `` the weary waiting for ideas , the blank reaction when they have been used , worst of all the despair when the thought which had seemed so bright and new goes dull and dark in the telling . ''

		Perhaps to no one more sharply than to the imaginative writer does the eternal contrast show itself between the practically possible and the ideally desirable .

		One can conceive of even Shakespeare as giving way to despair at his inability to give his thought adequate utter - ance .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 201 A FEARFUL POSSIBILITY IN WORD-FORMATION opens to view in connection with the newly introduced `` preparedness . ''

		As a correspon - dent of the Springiield '' Republican '' points out .

		the awkward term is a Germanism and has a certain '' rigidifiedness , '' an undisguised '' German madeness / ' hardly in harmony with the genius of our language .

		It begets , one might add , a very natural afraidness lest it may meet with such acceptedness that we shall ere long see the adoptedness of many similar terms having little or no adaptedness to our linguistic habituatedness .

		The ending - ness has a certain manifest relatedness to the German - niss -LRB- as in
Gleichniss	LOCATION	-RCB- .

		and it is true , without qualifiedness , that it can be very conveniently added to almost any past par - ticiple .

		Nevertheless this addedness has in most instances an undeniable uglifiedness , and accordingly there are many who entertain a firm convincedness that this newest Teutonic importedness ought to suffer , without de - layedness , a peremptory banishedness , after which our present wrong-headedness might give place to right-mindedness .

		A WORD FITLY SPOKEN is said , on high au - thority , to be like apples of gold in pictures of silver .

		Hardly so radiant as that , though extraordinarily expressive to the ear and to the imagination , is the word used by Mrs.
Amadeus Grabau	PERSON	-LRB- formerly Miss
Mary Antin	PERSON	-RRB- in describing the sufferings of her people in
eastern Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Goluth . ''

		she says , `` is our own word for our own sorrows .

		And to-day , in the second year of the great war , it is the name of the bloodiest horrors , the most excruciating torments , that ever rent Jewish flesh or agonized Jewish minds .

		Never were so many of our men and women and children on the rack at once ... Never was Goluth Goluth until to-day . ''

		Already the war has familiarized us with one Hebrew word .

		`` Armageddon . ''

		Is it destined to make the melancholy addition of '' Goluth '' to our vocabulary of woe ?

		A FRENCH KIPLING , as
M. Rene Benjamin	PERSON	is styled by some of his admirers , is one of the few bright and cheering literary phenomena -LRB- if it be permissible to call him a phenome - non 's of embattled
France	LOCATION	.

		His ''
Gaspard	PERSON	, '' buoyant , breezy , and irresistibly amusing , the best work of fiction the war has produced , has received the Goncourt prize by unanimous verdict the first instance of such unanimity in the history of the
Goncourt Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It reflects the author 's intimate personal ac - quaintance with just such strenuous military experience as falls to the lot of the '' poilu ''
Gaspard	PERSON	, who is now as popular a character with the French as
Mulvaney	PERSON	became with the English on his appearance in literature .

		Gas - pard owes his being largely to a wound re - ceived in battle by
M. Benjamin	PERSON	, a temporary disablement that gave the leisure needed for the writing of the book .

		Further personal details that have been made public describe the young author as a Parisian by birth , thirty years of age , a graduate of the
Lycee Louis-le-Grand	ORGANIZATION	, a journalist , satirist , drama - tist , and novelist .

		His father was
Ernest Benjamin	PERSON	, novelist and a member of the executive committee of the
Societe des Gens de Lettres	ORGANIZATION	; and the eminent veterinarian .

		Dr.
Henri Benjamin	PERSON	, member of the
Academic de Medecin	ORGANIZATION	.

		is his uncle .

		The author of '' Gaspard '' went to the front with his regi - ment at the beginning of the war , and except for the aforementioned hospital term has ever since been on duty with the indomitably cheerful `` poilus '' whom his book so faith - fully and amusingly depicts .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		EDUCATION AND WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In trying to fix the blame we have been looking to corrupt politics for the causes of the war ; but if we examine the facts more closely , we may dis - cover that the true cause lies in want of education .

		Politics are corrupt because they are based so largely on deceit , and they have seemed necessary because peoples are not sufficiently educated to trust one another .

		Education , as we have understood it during the past century and as it is understood to-day , has meant the gleaning of facts , the stuffing of the brain with information .

		The growth of science has tended to make machines of us .

		In its mechanical and tireless search after facts , it has robbed us of our feelings and of our religion .

		We no longer have time for meditation , for love , for sympathy , for appreciation ; there are so many facts to be gleaned !

		And we have mistaken the satisfying of this nervous curiosity of ours for education !

		We could not have gone further astray !

		In short , and in truth , we have been developing our brains and neglecting our feelings , stuffing our skulls and starving our hearts .

		And just as long as we go on in this way , we need not dream of peace .

		We are barbarians still ; cleverer , perhaps , than those who have gone before us , but , perhaps too , for that very reason more barbaric .

		The science of the nineteenth century we have applied to slaughtering one another in the twentieth .

		Here in
America	LOCATION	our universities are sadly in need of overhauling .

		Our scholarship consists in the collecting 1 of facts , and our teaching in trying to ram these facts into our youth .

		The liigher the heap of facts the greater the scholar , and often , too often , the poorer the teacher .

		The asset indis - 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	pensable to the university teacher is , not a large and attractive personality , not ability to teach , not a conduct of life worthy of emulation , but a doc - tor 's degree !

		And what does the degree signify ?

		Why , that the holder possesses his pile of facts !

		And very often the doctor is teaching for the simple reason that nothing else '' turned up . ''

		For - tunate young men , indeed , who are privileged to study under him !

		And
America	LOCATION	is still the land of opportunity !

		The most remarkable teacher I have ever known was in the habit of saying : '' Our purpose here at this school is , not to turn out teachers , but to discover them . ''

		Unfortunately the universities do not have as lofty an ideal : they are content with '' turning them out . ''

		Let a man of power , an artist , a thinker , a poet , appear in one of our universities , and he is warned that if he wishes '' to advance , '' '' to succeed '' professionally , he must lay by his dreams , his thoughts , and his songs , and gather facts .

		We expect , and with reason , that enlightenment will come through education ; but it will never come through what we have mistaken for educa - tion .

		There is danger in any extreme , yet we are persistently in pursuit of one .

		To rush to the opposite extreme would be no wiser ; but it does seem as if something like a mean could be reached and maintained .

		We need better teachers and better men , less skull-filling , and vastly more atten - tion to the development of the sense of right and wrong , of duty , of pity , of compassion , of rever - ence , of love , of beauty .

		We need to expend some of the energy that has gone to determining the probable origin of an adjective to rousing some wholesome human enthusiasm .

		If we no longer have the religion of our fathers , let us cultivate another .

		We need to feel , and to trust our feelings .

		Education in the future must mean the training of the heart as well as of the intellect .

		When men will have learned truth , faith , compassion , and love , there will no longer be danger of warfare or need of international polities .

		When men have ceased to be barbaric individually , they will no longer be so collectively .

		Instruct men 's minds and you make crafty animals ; instruct their hearts and you make men brothers .

		Crime is intellectual , not emotional .

		An impulse becomes criminal only when perverted by the mind .

		Of all crimes , war is the most hellish , for it contains all others within itself .

		Peace comes of enlightenment , and enlightenment emanates from what transcends reason the affections .


ALBERT E. TROMBLY	PERSON	.

		University of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Feb. 17 , 1916	DATE	.

		MR.
MASEFIELD	PERSON	AS A DRAMATIST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was very much surprised to see the amount of praise given to Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's '' The Faithful '' in a recent criticism in your pages .

		Reviewers have a practice , and a good one , of quoting significant lines of a book to substantiate their claims for or against it .

		I have a practice , in reading , of copy - ing into a note-book lines that strike me as par - ticularly fine ; and in this play there were four lines only , those quoted in the criticism : '' Sometimes , when guests have gone , the host remembers Sweet courteous things unsaid .

		We two have talked our hearts out to the embers , And now go hand and hand down to the dead . ''

		And what others could be quoted from '' The Faithful '' ?

		Where else is the same beauty of imagery and phrasing ?

		But
Chikara	PERSON	and
Kurano	PERSON	have not talked their hearts out to the embers .

		Far from it you are not convinced .

		Nor are they or the atmosphere of the play Japanese .

		And what greater peril to a character or a situa - tion than that you do not believe in it ?

		The test question always put to the dramatist is : What right have you to ask me to imagine this thing happening ?

		And again , fine as these quoted lines are , do we not feel that here Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	is speaking and not his character ?

		There is a notable instance of this in '' The Tragedy of Nan '' where Nan forces
Jenny	PERSON	to eat the tainted pie , saying : '' You shall eat the charity of the uncharitable , '' just the thing it would never enter Nan 's head to say .

		I consider '' Nan '' a wonderful and stirring play .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has his unique theory of tragedy -LRB- which he sets forth in a note prefacing `` Nan '' -RRB- , `` of the exultation which comes from a delighted brooding on excessively terrible things . ''

		There is no doubt but that he is a '' playwright trying for beauty , '' and no doubt but that he has found it in '' Nan , '' '' The Widow in the Bye Street , '' and his other very dramatic poems .

		But I do regret '' The Faithful , '' and the earlier play , '' Pompey the Great , '' where the old Romans are actually shocking with their ultra-modern English .

		Contemporary criticism must be a little generous for the sake of encouraging better effort , if for no other reason ; but do let 's be honest , especially in dealing with such a man as Mr.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 203 STUDIES OF FREXCH VERS IJIBRISTES .

		* Of the six contemporary French poets dealt with in her new volume , Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	is quite right in saying that they are little known in
America	LOCATION	, with the exception of Ver - haeren , who has shared the fate of his brave country in recently deserving our attention .

		Samain , de Gourmont , de R6gnier ,
Jammes	LOCATION	, ; and
Paul Fort	PERSON	do not figure in our academic programmes , and there is little information to be had in English concerning their personali - ties and their theories .

		The book , then , at - tracts the reader : the subject , the author , the publisher , and the price combine to warrant eager anticipation .

		Those who have a fondness for the essay j style will be the first to take up the book , and the first to be disillusioned .

		The task before the critic was so to interpret the writ - j ings of contemporary French poets as to j make them seem worthy of attention in Amer - ica .

		The task was attempted first in lectures in
Boston	LOCATION	, and later continued in the stout volume now published .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	is in sympathy with their work , being herself an | artificer in verse of a new style , and has had the opportunity in
Paris	LOCATION	of informing herself of their lives , their aims , their methods , and their message .

		As for Verhaeren , he is in a class by himself : he is a strong personality , ; an impressionistic painter of Flemish land - scape , and an interpreter of Flemish emo - tions ; he needs neither Miss
Lowell	PERSON	nor any one else to insist upon his genius .

		But for the others !

		The critic favors us with a few biographical details , such as can be gleaned in ; current French appreciations or in certain literary coteries of the capital .

		All this is !

		very thin and lacks proportion .

		But the j shock comes when we approach the interpreta - tion of this modern poetry , and are greeted by the most fulsome praise and exaggerated claims .

		Our interpreter appears to lack all background for her estimate of the permanent value of these latter-day poets .

		As has been \ often pointed out , French poetry at its best is difficult enough for us foreigners to i appreciate justly .

		But with
Villon	PERSON	.

		tively hysterical , she leaves us cold , in no degree persuaded that we have been missing anything vital in the literary expression of French genius .

		We do not recall less judg - ment , revealed in airy vaporings and in care - less style , in any book of the sort .

		Nor does one have to be an academic fogey , bound by the fetters of convention , to deplore such a volume of hazarded judgments .

		For `` the hair-splitting criticism turned out by erudite gentlemen for their own amusement '' Miss
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	expresses that disregard which artists often affect .

		But you , who are gentle readers , shall judge for yourselves presently of the unhappy execution of this attempt to exploit a literary field too little known .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	has a perfect right to her own taste in poetry , and to extol the French representa - tives of it .

		But she must prove its superior - ity to other French poetry , which we admire and love because it has something to say , and the harmony of which it will be hard to equal .

		She fails to establish her case for three rea - sons : because she does not succeed in dignify - ing the philosophy of the artists she treats ; because she furnishes us with no adequate background of the poetic tradition with which the vers libristes broke ; and because her presentation is trivial and vapid , expressed in language which is intended to be capti - vating , but which causes in the reader the pain induced by a perfervid and too often slip-shod style .

		The most valuable part of such a shallow book , as La Bruyere long ago remarked , consists of the lengthy extracts in the original .

		We may have our own opinion of the enduring quality of this sort of poetry ; but that is beside the purpose .

		Our protest is against
Miss Lowell	PERSON	's treatment of it , and our regret is that such a new and attractive subject should have fallen to the lot of such unscientific and uncritical appreciation .

		A reference to each of Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's essays will do something to warrant the strictures we have passed upon her irresponsible judgments . ''

		One strange thing about Verhaeren , '' we are told , '' is his true greatness ... No matter what
Verhaeren	PERSON	does , his work remains great , and full of what
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	calls ` high seriousness . '

		The purists may rail , that only shows how narrow the purists are .

		A great genius will disobey all rules and yet produce works of art , perforce '' -LRB- pp. 37-38 -RRB- .

		Again : '' That Verhaeren must have married some - time before
1896	DATE	is clear , because Les Heures Claires , published in that year , is the first of a series of love poems , of which Les Heures de I ` Apres-midi , published in
1905	DATE	, and
Les Heures du Soir	ORGANIZATION	, published in
1911	DATE	, are the other volumes '' -LRB- p. 44 -RRB- .

		If there are no 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	other arguments to prove the poet 's marriage , we are not greatly advanced in our facts ; for we have heard of poets who wrote love poems in single blessedness .

		However , assuming that there is a Mme.
Verhaeren	PERSON	, we are put off with this empty tribute : '' No biographer mentions who
Madame Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	was , or any - thing about her , except to pay her the tribute of understanding and cherishing a great man .

		That she has been a helpmeet to him in every way these poems prove '' -LRB- p. 45 -RRB- .

		Poor lady !

		Why drag her in at all , until someone has the rare enterprise to discover her identity ?

		One envies the conscience of a critic who can refer to persons and facts only to discard them in this blithe fashion .

		The second essay , on
Albert Samain	PERSON	, who died in
1900	DATE	, is more pleasing .

		The quota - tions make one wish to read more of this '' graceful , timid , proud , passionate , and reserved '' genius .

		In conclusion , our critic asks : '' Have I evoked a man for you ?

		Have I shown him as he was ? ''

		The question is a little disquieting , coming from a lady ; yet on the whole we can answer '' Yes . ''

		But the style is so lurid , so obtrusive , as to spoil the aesthetic pleasure one ought to feel when read - ing an aesthetic critic who is explaining an aesthetic vers libriste . ''


Paris	LOCATION	lured him like the Pot ` of ` Gold at the end of the Rainbow '' -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- .

		Again : `` Little dramas , they are , sufficient each one to itself with a perfect finality .

		And the delicacy with which they are done defies analysis .

		They are transpar - ent , hardly printing themselves upon the atmosphere , like egg-shell china held to the light .

		And yet what movement they have ! ''

		-LRB- p. 90 -RRB- .

		One should turn to the poems to which these remarks refer in order to decide whether ` this sort of thing is criticism , or whether it does not rather prove that one poet ought not to interpret another .


Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	, who died
last year	DATE	, did a little of everything , and
Miss Lowell	PERSON	does well not to claim first place for him in any - thing but in '' the aesthetic -LSB- sic -RSB- of the French language , '' whatever that may precisely mean . ''

		But the way he has written , no one can sur - pass him there ; and we , who try to write , mull over his pages for hours at a time , and endeavour to learn the lesson which he has analyzed and illustrated for us '' -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- .

		There is little room for quotation ; but we suspect that
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, the poet , has mulled over de Gourmont , as she says , and that her own poems prove her discipleship .

		In '' Six - tine , '' written partly in prose and partly in verse , de Gourmont '' wishes to prove that the world is only a simulacrum , and the perception of it hallucinatory '' -LRB- p. 111 -RRB- .

		It takes a genius to realize that , and `` the simple and ignorant public '' knows that life is neither a dream nor a simulacrum .

		The Master has given the wondering layman a definition of symbol - isme : '' If one keeps to its narrow and etymo - logical sense , '' it means '' almost nothing ; if one goes beyond that , it means : individualism in literature , liberty of art , abandonment of existing forms , a tending toward what is new , strange , and even bizarre , '' etc. -LRB- p. 119 -RRB- .

		The iconoclasm of the
School	ORGANIZATION	and the pose of its interpreters are well brought out in the Master 's further definition : '' The sole excuse which a man can have for writing is to write down himself , to unveil for others the sort of world which mirrors itself in his individual glass ; his only excuse is to be original ; he should say things not yet said , and say them in a form not yet formulated '' -LRB- p. 120 -RRB- .

		That programme will carry one well along toward extravagance , unless one have a strong dose of that excellent French quality of raison .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	is likely to hear from other quar - ters of this choice '' gaffe '' : '' The truth seems to be that , to most Frenchmen ,
Catholi	PERSON	- cism is more of a superstition than a religion .

		I hardly believe religion , as we conceive the term , to be possible to the Latin mind '' -LRB- p. 125 -RRB- .

		That is a pretty large order ; but our critic has a facility for original announce - ments , learned perhaps from de Gourmont as above quoted .

		Such a statement may some - times be made of one 's personal acquaintance , but hardly of an entire race .

		Of de
Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	's youth between
1858	DATE	and
1883	DATE	we learn nothing , '' as the only real biography of him I have been unable to get '' -LRB- p. 110 -RRB- .

		However , we must overlook the deficiency , as again in the case of Jammes -LRB- p. 262 -RRB- , and turn instead to de
Regnier	PERSON	, who '' is universally considered the greatest of the syrnboliste poets '' -LRB- p. 149 -RRB- .

		Here we have two pages of irrelevant family history going back so far as the sixteenth century , all calcu - lated to show what a very aristocratic gentle - man
M. de Regnier	ORGANIZATION	is .

		The whole ancestry is perfectly banal , and could be matched by hundreds of inconspicuous families .

		We are amazed to learn that '' he is one of the great poets of
France	LOCATION	, '' and that `` he is an even greater novelist .

		Such a novelist as there can be only a dozen or so in any nation 's history -LSB- sic -RSB- .

		Hugo ,
Stendahl	PERSON	-LSB- sic -RSB- ,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Flau	PERSON	- bert ,
Zola	LOCATION	,
Anatole France	LOCATION	, is he inferior to any of these ? ''

		-LRB- pp. 149-150 -RRB- .

		Well , most people would say so ; but we - are afraid to admit it , for fear of being condemned as a
Philistine	LOCATION	.

		Here is further appreciation of this wonderful man , expressed in wonderful English : `` After four hundred years , not of
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 205 steady rising , but -LRB- much more difficult prob - lem -RRB- continued arisen , this family has pro- duced one of the greatest poets and novelists which its country has known .

		Seven volumes of poetry , fifteen volumes of novels and stories -LRB- and all , mind you , works of the very first rank -RRB- , one play , and three volumes of essays , is his tally up to date .

		And the man is only fifty-one !

		Why !

		No stevedore could work so hard !

		It is colossal .

		And this man is a scion of an old aristocratic family ! ''

		-LRB- pp. 153 - 154 -RRB- .

		That challenge ought to have made old
Boston	LOCATION	's aristocracy sit up and take notice .

		But in
France	LOCATION	we have heard of a
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and of a certain Balzac who wrote quite a little parcel of pretty good novels and died before he was as old as
M. de Regnier	ORGANIZATION	.

		Really ,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	is so partial for this pro- lific aristocrat that , after quoting the Intro - duction of `` Les Medailles d'Argile , '' words fail her : `` Is any thing in any language more lovely than that ?

		If so , I do not know it '' -LRB- p. 192 -RRB- ; and again : `` Oh .

		they are beauti - ful , these poems !

		I know nothing more per - fect in any language '' -LRB- p. 203 -RRB- .

		If anyone else does , let him hold his peace in the pres - ence of this ecstasy .

		The essay on
Francis Janimes	PERSON	is our favor - ite .

		This poet has an attractive personality , his southern verse is so fresh and vital as to deserve to be better known , and
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's interpretation is more nearly sane .

		Fifty pages on
Paul Fort	PERSON	, dramatist and lyrist , form the last of the essays .

		As soon as he becomes known , we are told that he '' is certain to share with Verhaeren the unquali - fied admiration of English-speaking people '' -LRB- p. 271 -RRB- .

		`` Whether the proletariat agrees or not ,
Paul Fort	PERSON	is a great poet , a very great poet '' -LRB- p. 323 -RRB- .

		Believe me !

		Again , the common herd must wait until the scales fall from their eyes and they are initiated into the mysteries of tortured language and figure .

		The volume is accompanied with striking portraits of the six poets , which one is tempted to cut out and frame ; it contains an English prose translation of the French poems quoted in the text an example of pious supererogation .

		and an extended bibliog - raphy , in which the publishing house of the Societe du Mercure de
France	LOCATION	figures with suspicious regularity .

		The book belongs in the numerous class of trivial works on
Paris	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the French , which are so superfi - cial as to misrepresent the genius of the race they are intended to glorify .

		It is rare to find a
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	publication so marred by misprints .

		The following were caught in a first reading of the book : `` a le pointe '' -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- , `` gout '' ; P .

		62 -RRB- , `` bocs '' -LRB- p. 62 -RRB- , `` Provence '' -LRB- p. 86 -RRB- , `` tout se taisent '' -LRB- p. 89 -RRB- , `` Lecompte de

		THE JLONG CHILDHOOD OF THE RACE .

		* Pithecanthropus , the ape-man of
Java	LOCATION	, probably lived nearly 500,000 years ago .

		The
Heidelberg	LOCATION	man , represented by a massive jaw from the sands of
Mauer	PERSON	, may have existed about 250,000 years ago , half-way between our time and that of the ape-man .

		The Chel - lean culture-stage is perhaps a hundred thou - sand years old .

		These estimates are not exact , but it is at least certain that the period of written history represents but a minute frag - ment of the whole story of man .

		Though each successive generation has died , the stream of life has been continuous , and we of to-day represent the fruition of many hundreds of centuries of ceaseless endeavor .

		Before such I a record our preconceived ideas are shaken , , and we ask ourselves whether some purpose j dominated the evolutionary process , or whether civilization may be a relatively tran - i sient and accidental by-product , destined to I perish because too remote from the broad !

		deep currents of animal life .

		The discoveries of anthropologists do not in themselves form a basis for philosophy , but they necessarily I change and color all philosophical systems .

		We had vaguely known that humanity had its roots in the remotest past , but now a large portion of that past is unrolled before us , and we are able to realize what man has been during by far the greater part of his exis - tence .

		Fragmentary as the record is , it begins to assume reasonable coherence , and for a hundred thousand years or so we may even be said to possess a sort of history .

		It is natural to compare the earlier types with modern man , and deem them imperfect in proportion to their remoteness from our standard .

		In reality each successive form represented the apex of development , perhaps at least as well fitted for its special environ - ment as we are for ours .

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	the man of
Mauer	PERSON	were sufficient unto them - selves , surely not mere models in the rough of something yet to come .

		Yet , looking back on the story as a whole , it is hard not to see what the biologists call orthogenesis , evolu - tion having a definite trend and a definite fructification , seeming as though designed .

		This is the ideal of progress , the most char - acteristic peculiarity of our species as it exists to-day .

		Individually and racially , we believe that we are going somewhere .

		The late
C. R. Henderson	PERSON	used to say that to him perhaps the greatest obstacle to belief in a benevolent providence was the fact of the late discovery of the microscope .

		Why had so many suffered through the ages for lack of the knowledge this instrument might pro- vide ?

		In the case of the earlier human types , there is no obstacle to the belief that they were living as full a life as their capacities permitted ; but when we come to the
Upper Palaeolithic	ORGANIZATION	, we find in the Cro-Magnon man a being with abilities similar to our own , and perhaps only inferior to us in lack of inven - tions and traditions .

		It seems an extraor - dinary thing that for thousands of years there lived a creature possessing inherent powers which could not find adequate development , which were destined to remain latent , await - ing the slow growth of socially inherited knowledge .

		It is Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	's puzzle on an infinitely larger scale .

		Professor
H. F. Osborn	PERSON	, in his '' Men of the Old Stone Age , '' has brought together in readable and connected form all the new and old information concerning early man , with an abundance of excellent illustrations , many of them the work of palaeolithic man himself , j taken from the caves of
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		From his long study of mammalian evolution , and his special interest in the glacial period , lie has been able to approach the subject in a broad spirit , and deal with it as adequately as modern knowledge permits .

		The progress of recent years has been so great that all the older books are quite out of date , and the reader is astonished to find how much real information now takes the place of the nebu - lous speculations of only a few years ago .

		In place of a confused mass of more or less unre - lated facts , we now have a reasonably con - nected story , not too difficult to understand .

		In one respect even this new book probably stands in need of amendment .

		An important section is given over to the Piltdown race , discovered in the gravels of
Sussex	LOCATION	, and described by
A. S. Woodward	PERSON	of the British Museum as a new genus combining the char - acters of man with those of the higher apes .

		This man or animal is considered by Profes - sor
Osborn	PERSON	as a side branch of the human family , which has left no descendants ; but still more recently , Mr.
G. S. Miller	PERSON	of the
U. S. National Museum	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken to prove , and apparently with success , that the supposed new genus consists of a primitive human skull and the jaw of a chimpanzee !

		Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the Piltdown race , the general argument pre - sented by Professor
Osborn	PERSON	is not affected , and the more interesting and important part of the evidence , resting on quite a different basis , can not be assailed .

		The now numerous discoveries of remains of the Neanderthal race prove that this primitive type of man was normal in his day , dominant and wide-spread over central and western
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We have an excellent idea of his physical structure and of his simple culture .

		He was not our ances - tor , but was displaced at the beginning of upper palaeolithic time by the true homo sapiens , the Cro-Magnon man , a type `` which ranks high among the existing types in capac - ity and intelligence . ''

		The new race came , as wise men are supposed to do , from out of the
East	LOCATION	, and somewhere in
Asia	LOCATION	the true begin - nings of our own species of man must be sought .

		A bust , modelled with the aid of the skeletal remains , shows a remarkably fine type , which would look well anywhere in the modern world .

		The good opinion thus formed is fortified and increased when we examine the wonderful examples of palaeolithic art left in the caves of southwestern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is extraordinary to see the hairy mammoth , with characteristic pose , drawn by the man to whom it was a familiar object .

		The master - piece of the collection , illustrated by a colored plate , is the bison from the ceiling at Alta - mira , vividly painted in four shades of color .

		In a sense these figures are crude , but they are wonderfully life-like , showing keen obser - vation and genuine artistic ability .

		They are as different as possible from the poor picto - graphs left by the
American Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cro-Magnon man was by no means the only variety of homo sapiens which entered
Europe	LOCATION	, but he was the most interesting .

		The modern population is extremely complex , but it is a curious fact that the present inhabi - tants of Dordogne possess the peculiar cranial features of the Cro-Magnon type , which actu - ally inhabited the same region in palaeolithic days .

		There are good reasons , it appears , for believing that this ancient blood survives lit - tle diluted , and herein lies an additional argu - ment favoring the view that these men of old were not inferior in inherent capacity to those

ADA	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Lord
Stratheona	PERSON	or
Donald A. Smith	PERSON	, as he was known to several generations of Canadians was a product of
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Like his cousin ,
George Stephen	PERSON	-LRB- afterward Lord Mount-Stephen -RRB- , Sir Sand - ford
Fleming	PERSON	, and many another famous Canadian , he was born north of the Tweed , and in early manhood crossed the seas to seek his fortune in the new world .

		There must surely be some peculiar virtue in the combina - tion of Scottish character and a Canadian environment , if one may judge by the results in cases such as these .

		Physical , economic , and other difficulties that might surely dis - courage most men , seem but to add zest to the lives of those hardy sons of the north .

		Where , indeed , will one find a more extraordinary story of sheer determination and will-power surmounting all obstacles , than in the life of
Donald Smith	ORGANIZATION	?

		He came to
Canada	LOCATION	a boy of eighteen , and can hardly be said to have been welcomed with open arms , as he was banished to the bleak and inhospitable coast of
Labra	LOCATION	- dor , where he spent more than a quarter of a century of his life .

		Yet he lived to become Governor of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	's High Commissioner in
England	LOCATION	, a peer of the Empire , and one whom statesmen and princes delighted to honor .

		The service of the
Hudson 's Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	has from the beginning appealed to the spirit of adventure of
Scotchmen	LOCATION	, and in the case of
Donald Smith	ORGANIZATION	there were special reasons why his thoughts should turn to the great fur country of the west .


John Stuart	PERSON	and
Robert Stuart	PERSON	, his mother 's two brothers , and Cuth - bert
Grant	PERSON	and
Cuthbert Gumming	PERSON	, her cousins , were all famous Nor ` Westers .

		Their romantic exploits in that wonderful land of boundless plains and forests , gigantic moun - tains , sea-like lakes , and mighty rivers , with its countless herds of buffalo in the south and caribou in the north , and its wild Indian in - habitants , became familiar to their young kinsman ; and it is not surprising to find his thoughts turning more and more to the west , until he finally made up his mind to answer the insistent call .

		He landed at
Montreal	LOCATION	in
July , 1838	DATE	, and after a characteristic inter - view with the cold-hearted but most efficient little autocrat of the fur-trade ,
George Simp	PERSON	- son , found himself duly apprenticed to the Honourable Company of Adventurers of

		life of
Stratheona	LOCATION	, tells the story of his quar - ter-century or more of service on the
Labra	LOCATION	- dor , his gradual promotion to the charge of the important
Montreal	LOCATION	department ; his visit to the
Red River Colony	ORGANIZATION	as a special commis - sioner of the
Canadian Government	ORGANIZATION	, and his exciting experiences with the leader of the
Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	,
Louis Riel	PERSON	.

		This visit to the west changed the whole current of
Donald Smith	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		He became deeply interested in the struggling little settlements that were soon to develop into the Province of
Manitoba	LOCATION	, and quickly recognized the wonderful agricul - tural possibilities of the
Red River	LOCATION	valley .

		When
Manitoba	LOCATION	was brought into the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian Confederation in
1870	DATE	, he became one of the first representatives of the province in the
Dominion Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and so began his career as a public man , a career which brought him at one time or another into more or less bitter conflict with the leaders of both the political parties of the country .

		From his visit to
Red River	LOCATION	may also be said to date
Donald Smith	ORGANIZATION	's interest in the i question of transportation , an interest which brought him into close contact with such rail - way builders as
J. J. Hill	PERSON	,
Norman W. Kitt	PERSON	- j son ,
R. B. Angus	PERSON	, and his cousin
George Stephen	PERSON	, and which ultimately had a good I deal to do with the organization of the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian
Pacific Railway Syndicate	ORGANIZATION	and the build - ing of
Canada	LOCATION	's first transcontinental railway .

		There are some rather controversial points connected with
Donald Smith	PERSON	's career as a Canadian politician , and a builder of rail - ways ; but it is impossible to enter into them here , even if it were desirable .

		On these and many other points , Mr.
Willson	PERSON	's book will be found an admirable , if a trifle ponderous , foil to the somewhat vindictive though unques - tionably clever biography of
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	by i Mr.
W. T. R	PERSON	,
Preston	PERSON	.

		The latter pictures !

		Mr.
Preston	PERSON	would no doubt put his own interpretation on '' political temper , '' but Mr.
Willson	PERSON	's meaning is wholly complimentary .

		As in so many other cases , the truth probably lies somewhere between these two extremes .

		Not the least striking fact in the life of
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	, and one quite characteristic of his indomitable spirit , is his acceptance at the ; age of seventy-six of the important post of I High Commissioner : and it was equally char - acteristic of the man that he should have !

		These are but the broad outlines of a par - ticularly long life packed with achievement , the details of which will be found in Mr.
Willson	PERSON	's two substantial volumes .

		If one had any criticism to offer of his work , it would be that he has sometimes gone out of his way to enlarge at great length on the history of men and events touching only very indirectly the story of Lord
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	.

		However , that is a fault that has its redeeming features ; and on the whole , Mr.
Willson	PERSON	's biography is an admirable piece of work .


LAWRENCE J. BURPEE	PERSON	.

		THE CASE AGAINST '' SHAKSPERE . ''

		* The `` Bacon-Shakespeare question , '' which has been well characterized as the vainest of all paradoxes , seems to exert a peculiar fasci - nation on lawyers .

		This may perhaps be accounted for by the fragmentary and desul - tory character of the details that have been hitherto accumulated concerning the earthly career of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	and which lend themselves with peculiar facility to all sorts of jugglery and prestidigitation .

		The profes - sional pride of the biologist bent on recon - structing an extinct species from a few fossil remains is as nothing compared with the zeal of a clever lawyer engaged on a case which , because of the unlikelihood of his circum - venting the law , tests his ingenuity to the utmost .

		This , we take it , is the explanation for Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's book , '' Is There a Shake - speare Problem ? ''

		although he would proba - bly have resisted the call to write it had not Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, and the late An - drew
Lang	PERSON	seen fit to reply to his former book , '' The Shakespeare Problem Re-stated . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	is not , and we say this emphatically , though he once was , a `` Baco - nian . ''

		He resents nothing so much as being included among the `` Baconians . ''

		He is an '' anti-Willian , '' i. e. he contents himself with maintaining only that Willy '' Shakspere '' of
Stratford	LOCATION	-LRB- 1564-1616 -RRB- , actor , money-lender , maltster , huckster , and realty speculator , was not the William '' Shake-speare '' who wrote the plays and poems known as ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works . ''

		In fact , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's thesis is that `` Shake-speare , '' with or without the hyphen , was not the name of the author of * Is THERE A SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM ?

		With a Reply to Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	and Mr.
Andrew Langr	PERSON	.

		By
G. G. Green	PERSON	- wood ,
M.P. New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		those immortal works ; that `` Shake-speare '' was only a pen-name or pseudonym , either for an unknown individual , a man of rank `` who had reasons for concealing his iden - tity , '' or for a syndicate of writers who pub - lished their poetic and dramatic effusions under this name , under some arrangement with `` Shakspere '' the actor , because the spear-shaking form of his name `` makes an excellent nom de plume '' !

		Why it had to be the name of a particular individual , especially of an individual not otherwise distinguished for literary achievements , and what the par - ticular virtues of the surname `` Shake-speare '' are , we are not informed .

		Presumably , though we are not told anything about it , no other Englishman of that day had such a fine-sounding -LRB- ? -RRB-

		name ; or , if he had , would have lent it or sold it for such a purpose .

		Presumably , too , no other Englishman but the
Stratford	LOCATION	rustic , not even
Bacon	LOCATION	, would have consented even for a consideration to go through life with the stigma of having written such unconsidered trifles as `` Venus and Adonis , '' `` Hamlet , '' `` Lear , '' `` Othello , '' etc. .

		Presumably , too , no other Londoner but this country yokel , whose only virtue lay in his name -LRB- which Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	says he could hardly write -RRB- , would have agreed to have '' a wretched picture and worse bust , '' a doggerel epitaph and some Latin verses con - taining `` a howling false quantity , '' survive him .

		For of course these things must have figured in the bargain between Shakspere and '' the great unknown '' or unknowns .

		To Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	so great is the credulity of man , especially of lawyers there is nothing inher - ently improbable in the assumption that an uneducated , semi-illiterate clown , speaking an almost unintelligible patois , could be palmed off on
London	LOCATION	, the
London	LOCATION	of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
James	PERSON	, as the author of literary works that were the wonder and the delight of the day .

		Does Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	really believe that if such had been the fact , some member of that illustrious syndicate would not have left some - where a hint of the transaction , or that some - one in that gossipy and curious age would not have remarked on the incongruity of a man so ill-qualified writing such works , or that someone would not have openly questioned the reputed paternity of those compositions ?

		Not all the king 's horses nor all the king 's men can make us believe that .

		Furthermore , who can believe that the numerous writers of that day who wrote
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's praises , such as Meres ,
Davies	PERSON	,
Scolloker	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Freeman	PERSON	,
Digges	PERSON	,
Weever	PERSON	, etc. , did not know the man in the flesh 1 Or were they all in the great secret ?

		Aware of some of these difficul -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 209 ties , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	, unlike most Baco we beg pardon !

		anti-Willians is willing to ad - mit that '' Shakspere '' had some education , must have known a little Latin and Greek , had a few legal phrases at his command -LRB- as a result of his business transactions -RRB- , and even had some but very little skill in penman - ship .

		In fact , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	seems even ready to agree with the Rev.
Begley	PERSON	, whom he quotes without contradiction , that `` Willy can - not be totally excluded from the immortal plays -LRB- the poems are not included -RRB- , and that he assuredly had a hand in '' working at and patching up the various old plays he had scraped together . ''

		Unless this means that '' our fellow Will '' was permitted to trim the manuscripts or bind the loose sheets together , we are to conclude that `` Shakspere '' wrote the non-Shakespearean portions of '' Shake - speare . ''

		If Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's book will not convince the reading public , nothing else will .

		It is remarkably well written and very readable .

		His humor , his sarcasms , his adroitness , his personalities , his cleverness , the earnestness and vehemence with which he argues his case , prevent him from being dull or uninteresting for any unduly long time , notwithstanding the repetition of old and hackneyed data and overworked , if unsound , arguments .

		He is so shrewd in his analysis of some of the evidence , so systematic in the exposition of his thesis , so merciless in his exposure of the shallow - ness , the absurdities , and the ignorance of poorly equipped biographers and commenta - tors , that scholarly orthodox Shakespeareans must give his book heedful note .

		If it were not for an apparently ineradicable bias in the question at issue a bias which utterly dis - qualifies him for a genuinely scientific , objec - tive study of the evidence , a deep rooted , perhaps unconscious , hatred of '' Shakspere '' the man , this would really have been a valua - ble contribution to our knowledge of the Elizabethan period .

		We can conceive of almost nothing more unprofitable than a summary of Mr.
Green	PERSON	- wood 's counts against `` Shakspere '' would be .

		There is not a single fact by way of commis - sion or omission in the annals of '' Shakspere '' and his family that he can not and does not distort into an argument against the
Strat	PERSON	- fordian 's authorship of the writings attributed to him by his contemporaries and poster - ity .

		To every point made by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's biographers he exclaims triumphantly : '' Just what we should have expected of Shakspere the actor !

		But absolutely inconceivable of Shake-speare the poet ! ''

		Sensible of the f act that a chain is not stronger than its weakest link , and that some of his links are very weak , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	takes refuge in the analogy of a rope one of whose fibres is easily broken but whose strength is not thereby impaired .

		But every one of the threads in the rope woven by Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	is rotten .

		Speak - ing legally , we may say that no judge would submit a case to a jury , even where only a literary matter is in dispute , in which each !

		single evidential item had been struck from the minutes as either incompetent , immate - rial , or irrelevant , as would unquestionably be the case if Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	had brought his action in a court of law instead of in the court of public opinion .

		It is more than likely that after the presentation of his case a motion to dismiss with costs would immedi - ately be granted , and he would be very fortu - nate if shortly thereafter he were not himself the defendant in several actions for libel and malicious prosecution .

		Determined to retain
Rowe	PERSON	's fantastic and utterly unfounded assertion that
William	PERSON	was withdrawn from school at the age of thirteen to help his father , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	accepts unquestioningly the general belief that
John Shakespeare	PERSON	had declined into the vale of poverty about the year
1577	DATE	.

		He gives the reader the impression that Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	and the Rev.
T. Carter	PERSON	are the only ones who adopt the `` baseless '' -LRB- ? -RRB-

		theory that the poet 's father was not reduced to a state of penury .

		But there are others such honest independent investigators as Hunter , Knight , De
Quincey	PERSON	, who find the evidence of a '' penniless '' Shakespeare not only insufficient but contradicted by very positive evidence proving that
John	PERSON	was fairly prosperous to the end of his days .

		Even
Halliwell-Phil	PERSON	- lipps repeatedly warns his readers of the in - I sufficiency and unreliability of the evidence !

		of pecuniary embarrassment .

		Rowe invented the story to account for
William	PERSON	's `` small Latin and less Greek '' ; and Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	retains it to show that
William	PERSON	could not have had all the learning that '' Shake-speare '' dis - | plays .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's theory requires a semi-illiterate , rustic
William	PERSON	, and he forces everything to that formula .

		Many of the facts relied upon by
Malone	PERSON	and his succes - sors to prove
John	PERSON	's poverty are more than probably attributable to his Catholicism .

		An honest consideration of the evidence , by no means insignificant either in quality or quan - tity , will convince any sane and unbiased j student that to the end of his days
John i Shakespeare	PERSON	not only lived in comparative | affluence but enjoyed all those things that '' should accompany old age , as honor , love , obedience , troops of friends . ''

		The stories of 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	his being a broken bankrupt and a bailiff - hunted debtor are figments of the imagination .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	devotes a long chapter to proving , by quotations from various Baco - nians and some orthodox Shakespeareans , that Shake-speare was '' a man of the highest culture , of wide reading , much learning , and a large familiarity with the classics , '' and that therefore he could not have been the
William	PERSON	who was -LRB- ? -RRB-

		withdrawn from a filthy village school at the age of thirteen by an impecu - nious -LRB- ? -RRB-

		father and who is fabled to have been flogged for raids on imaginary deer in a park that never existed , and who made a hasty marriage at eighteen .

		But the gram - mar school at
Stratford	LOCATION	, we have good reason to believe , was then one of the best in En - gland ; and , as we have no good reason for assuming that he left that school without com - pleting the course of education there given , it is all but certain that he could there have obtained that knowledge of Latin and Greek the only subjects taught that he exhibits , and that acquaintance with certain writings of
Horace	PERSON	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Juvenal	LOCATION	,
Plautus	LOCATION	, and Seneca that his critics find .

		If he was he and we see no reason yet for doubting it we may rest assured that he loved books too much not to continue his reading in the classics after he left school .

		Others have done it ; why not he ?

		And there is no inherent im - probability in the assumption that on his arrival in
London	LOCATION	, whither his genius called him , he found himself in an environment that induced him to take up the fashionable study of French and Italian .

		We can not resist the opportunity of giving the reader a taste of Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	as a logician and as an interpreter of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He adduces Hamlet 's sentence , `` Sense sure you have , Else could you not have motion , '' to prove that
Shakespeare	PERSON	`` was undoubtedly familiar with the Aristotelian psychology . ''

		To accomplish this marvel he tells us , after many flourishes , that according to
Aristotle	PERSON	`` the faculties of the soul are growth , sense -LRB- or sensibility -RRB- , desire , motion , and reason .

		Plants have only the principle of growth ; animals have sense as well , which is the dis - tinguishing faculty of the animal soul ... Motion implies sense , and an animal that has motion must necessarily have sense as well . ''

		Thereupon , backed by his `` old friend Dr.
Jackson	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, F.B.A. , of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, '' he exclaims : `` That we have here the true explanation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's words can not , I think , be disputed . ''

		The old commentators , he informs us , could make nothing of the above passage , and
Warburton	PERSON	actually proposed to read `` notion '' instead of '' motion , '' '' an absurd suggestion , which -LSB- like all other conjectural emendations -RSB- sev - eral editors thought worthy of being placed on record . ''

		But Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	carefully suppresses the fact that modern commenta - tors give a perfectly satisfactory explanation of
Hamlet	LOCATION	's words without resorting to Aris - totle or altering the text .

		Hamlet , excoriat - ing his mother for her choice of a second husband , whom he paints in most uncompli - mentary colors , says to her : `` Mental facul - ties -LSB- sense -RSB- you surely have , else could you not have feelings , desires , emotions , i. e. sen - sual cravings . ''

		The words `` sense '' and '' motion '' were commonly employed by the Elizabethans and by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the senses here given .

		For Hamlet to have told his mother then that she must have sensibility because she had the power of locomotion would be the acme of inanity , and wholly inconsistent with what follows .

		A long chapter is devoted to the attempt to prove that Shakespeare the poet must have '' received some special training in the law , '' and that he could therefore not have been the
Stratford Shakspere	LOCATION	who devoted his time to killing calves in high style for the purpose of rehabilitating his father 's fortune .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	accomplishes this , as he thinks , by quoting the opinions of various '' authorities '' to the effect that Shake-speare thought as a lawyer , that his thoughts took a legal mold , that he introduces legal expressions '' when there is no necessity for them and sometimes when they seem not a little out of place , or even inartistic , i. e. on occasions when they would not suggest themselves to an ordinary layman , '' that he employs legalisms in such a manner as to indicate a `` real knowledge of the rules and technicalities of the law , '' and that according to Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	and the '' Encyclopaedia of the Laws of
England	LOCATION	'' he was '' ever accurate in his legal terminology . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	has apparently never heard of a book by the late Mr.
Charles Allen	PERSON	-LRB- Attorney General of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
1867	DATE	-
72	DATE	, and
Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, 1882-98 -RRB- , in which it is shown that '' Shakespeare '' shows no evi - dences of a legal education , that his supposed knowledge of law has been greatly exag - gerated , that many of his legalisms are intro - duced in a manner more characteristic of a layman than of a skilled lawyer , that he em - ploys such legal expressions as a lawyer would never employ , that some of his plots are based on such bad law that no lawyer would abide them , that many of his legal phrases are strained , untechnical , and inaccurate , that his contemporaries , in accordance with the fash -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 211 ion of the day , employed legalisms as freely as he did and that some of them introduced into their compositions many legal terms and allusions to which no parallels can be found in his works , and that many of his legal ideas are such as a trained lawyer would not be capable of .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	, I may add , was not a lawyer , and yet he introduces into his works legalising even more abundantly , more spon - taneously , and at least as accurately as Shake - speare into his . ''

		Shakspere '' had ample opportunities to learn the verbiage and techni - calities of the law from his own as well as his father 's experiences .

		Besides , there is evi - dence at hand , as Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	knows , that
William	PERSON	may have been a student at one of the
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	before he left -LRB- not `` fled from '' -RRB-
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		All recent '' anti-Willians , '' following the lead of Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, treat their readers to frequent sarcastic references to ''
Shak	PERSON	- spere 's '' application for a coat-of-arms and his genuinely English desire to be styled '' gentleman . ''

		To your Baconian , Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	is as unimpeachable as holy writ when he says something discreditable to
William	PERSON	or his family .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	informs his read - ers that in
1599	DATE	William had `` with great difficulty obtained from the College of Arms a recognition of his claim to a coat-of-arms . ''

		There is not a particle of evidence that the Shakespeares had any difficulty in obtaining this coveted distinction .

		Furthermore , there is extant irrefutable evidence that the appli - cation for arms was granted in
1596	DATE	, not in
1599	DATE	.

		But Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	prefers to accept the latter date , so as to create or heighten the probability that
William Shakespeare	PERSON	was caricatured by
Jonson	PERSON	in the person of the ridiculous Sogliardo -LRB- in '' Every Man Out of His Humour . ''

		1600 -RRB- who obtained a coat-of - arms '' after much toil ' among the harrots . ' ''

		If
Jonson	PERSON	had intended maliciously to allude to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's coat-of-arms he would not have waited till
1600	DATE	, three and a half years after the grant , to do so .

		To further heighten the assumed resemblance between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Sogliardo , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	translates the latter 's motto , `` Not without Mustard , '' into the French , '' Non sans Moutarde , '' a form in which it never occurs in
Jonson	PERSON	's play .

		Her - aldic mottoes with the words `` Not without '' were very common in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, but they were almost invariably rendered '' Sine . ''

		not '' Non sans . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's assertion that it is now generally admitted that in `` Every Man Out of His Humour ''
Jonson	PERSON	has a hit at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is , to say the least , an exaggeration .

		Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's wretched account of fraud and trickery on the part of
William	LOCATION	, his father , and the officials of the
College	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , accepted in its entirety by Mr.
Green	PERSON	- wood , notwithstanding that there is not a word : of truth in it .

		All that I said on this subject in my review of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Dec. 9 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- applies verbatim to the book now under consideration .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	goes beyond recent Baco - nians and Shakespeare biographers in his comments on a subject that has received but little attention at their hands .

		He says : ``
John Shakspere	PERSON	had made -LSB- an application to the Heralds ' College -RSB- once before , viz .

		in
1568	DATE	, while he was bailiff of
Stratford	LOCATION	, sup - porting it by numerous fictions concerning his family .

		The negotiations of
1568	DATE	, however , proved abortive . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's confident assertion that this application '' proved abor - tive '' is founded on Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's opinion that '' otherwise there would have been no necessity for the further action of
1596	DATE	. ''

		Inasmuch as this matter has not hitherto been elucidated , and as it furnishes an excellent illustration of the slovenliness with which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's biography has been written , we append the following explanatory comments .

		The
1568	DATE	application for a coat-of-arms is not known to be in existence .

		Mr.
Green	PERSON	- wood 's confident assertion , therefore , that this application was based on `` numerous fictions concerning his -LSB-
John	PERSON	's -RSB- family '' is mere fic - tion .

		Whether the
1568	DATE	transaction proved abortive remains to be seen .

		In
1599	DATE	the her - alds made the assertion that `` John Shake - spere -LSB- sic -RSB- produce this his Auncyent Cote of Arms heretofore Assigned to him whilest he was her ma ` tes officer & Baylife of -LSB-
Strat	PERSON	- ford -RSB- . ''

		In the second -LRB-
1596	DATE	-RRB- draft , a memo - randum asserts that '' This
John	PERSON	sent A patierne thereof under
Clarent Cooks	ORGANIZATION	hand in papor , '' i. e. that
John Shakspere	PERSON	presented a draft of the wished-for coat drawn and writ - ten by
Robert Cook	PERSON	,
Clarencieux	PERSON	.

		This is all we know about the matter .

		Halliwell-Phil - lipps was of the opinion that `` no grant of arms was made to
John Shakespeare	PERSON	before
1597	DATE	, for he is called ` yeoman ' in a -LSB- Latin -RSB- deed dated -LSB- early -RSB- in that year . ''

		But this is more than offset by the fact that after
1568	DATE	, the year of his bailiffship ,
John	PERSON	was almost invariably accorded the honorable addition of '' Master '' in the
Corporation Records	ORGANIZATION	, in the Parish Register , and in private documents ; and in
1580	DATE	he was included in `` A
Booke	PERSON	of the names and Dwelling places of the Gentle - men and Freeholders in the Countie of War - wick . ''

		In the absence of the least particle of evi - dence to the contrary , the assertions of the 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	heralds concerning - the early -LRB- 1568 -RRB- arms are entitled to be regarded as truths emanating from the highest authority .

		Fortunately for the lovers of the dramatist-poet ,
John Shake	PERSON	- speare applied for arms at the very time when the College must have been particularly free from all possibility of corruption .

		During the years 1593-5 , the quarrels of Dethick ,
Camden	LOCATION	, and
Brooke	PERSON	, involving all the officers of the
College	ORGANIZATION	in their angry accusations and recriminations , reached such enormous pro- portions that , in order to save the
College	ORGANIZATION	from utter ruin , the Queen was compelled to interfere .

		She commissioned
Lord Treasurer Burghley	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Howard	PERSON	, and
Lord Hunsdon	PERSON	to take full charge of the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the purpose of correcting the abuses complained of , and of restoring 1 order among the heralds ,
Sir Edward Hobby	ORGANIZATION	and Sir
George Carew	PERSON	were then authorized to draw up a set of ordinances for the government of the officers of the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lords rendered their report on
September 28 , 1596	DATE	, less than a month prior to the date of the
1596	DATE	Shake - speare drafts .

		At such a time the heralds would not be likely to imperil their positions by referring to a non-existent draft or patent in
Cook	LOCATION	's hand .

		Why , Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	may ask , was it neces - sary for
John Shakespeare	PERSON	to apply for a eoat-of-arms in
1596	DATE	if one w r as granted him some twenty-seven years before ?

		The answer to this question we conceive to be as follows : In 1568
John Shakespeare	PERSON	was elevated by his fellow burgesses to the honorable position of `` bailiff and justice of the peace '' of the incorporated borough of
Stratford	LOCATION	, and by virtue of that office he achieved the social grade of '' gentleman '' for the rest of his life .

		The effect of municipal honors and dignities to advance a yeoman to the rank of gentry and to entitle him to coat armor was a note - worthy feature of the political system of the
England	LOCATION	of the sixteenth century .

		Sir
John Feme	PERSON	-LRB- `` The blazon of gentrie '' -RRB- , writing in
1586	DATE	, says : '' If any person be advanced into an office or dig - nity of publique administration .

		.

		the Here - aide must not refuse to devise to such a publique person , upon his instant request , and willingness to bear the same without reproche , a
Coate of Armes	ORGANIZATION	, and thenceforth to matriculate him with his intermarriages and issues descending in the
Regis	PERSON	- ter of the gentle and noble ... In the
Civil or Political State	ORGANIZATION	divers Offices of dignitie and worship doe merite
Coates	PERSON	of Armes to the pos - sessours of the same Offices , as .

		.

		Bailiffs of Cities and ancient Boroughs or , incorporated townes . ''

		Sir
William Camden	PERSON	, one of the very highest authorities on matters of Heraldry , informs us that there were in
England	LOCATION	four sorts of
Esquires	LOCATION	, one of them being '' Esquires by virtue of their offices , as justices of the peace . ''

		Smithurst and other old writers on Heraldry speak to the same effect .

		So that
John Shake	PERSON	- speare may very well have applied to
Robert Cook	PERSON	for a coat-of-arms in consideration of his prosperous circumstances and the impor - tant offices he held , and obtained his request .

		From Professor Christian , quoted in var - ious editions of
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	's Commentaries , we learn that those who achieved armorial in - signia by virtue of public office had a right to that distinction for life .

		By 1596
John Shakespeare	PERSON	was retired from business , his son was winning renown in the literary and dramatic world and was acquiring wealth .

		Being apprised of
William	LOCATION	's intention to pur - chase New Place , the second best house in
Stratford	LOCATION	, the thought occurred to
Master Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, former Bailiff , Justice of the Peace , and
Chief Alderman	PERSON	, that now was the time to elevate the family in the social scale , preserve to posterity a record of the achieve - ments of his ancestors , and perpetuate his own distinguished career .

		Having succeeded in this , he subsequently , in
1599	DATE	, applied for permission to impale the arms of
Arden	LOCATION	with those of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, so as to perpetuate the gentle descent of his wife ; but for some unknown reason the transaction was not completed .

		In all this there was absolutely nothing to be ashamed of , and nothing incon - sistent with the poetic genius of
William SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		ECONOMIC INFLUENCES IN THE FORMATION OF AMERICAN PARTIES .

		* Notwithstanding the protests of some churchmen against the giving over of all his - tory to the heartless hand of '' economic deter - minism , '' and of the disciples of
Freeman	PERSON	against the neglect of `` past politics , '' the school of historians who believe in the `` eco - nomic interpretation of history '' is steadily gaining in strength .

		The fact is that practi - cally all of our historians have belonged to this school , though some do not realize it and some would deny it .

		Even the high-sounding phrases of
Bancroft	LOCATION	about rights and liberty and patriotism mean little more than that the colonists fought
England	LOCATION	because they be - lieved it to be to their economic interest to do so .

Charles A. Beard	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
1916	DATE	-RSB-
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	213 ity based upon conflicting economic interests .

		The whole course of our tariff controversies , from .

		1789 to
1913	DATE	, is nothing but the strug - gle of conflicting interests .

		The difference is simply this : In the older historians the conflict of economic interests is a mere incident , often a subordinate one , which we only read about between the lines made luminous by the heat of conflict over the Constitution , the sacredness of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and things of like character .

		On the other hand , the historians of the newer school put the economic phase of the conflict in bold - face - type at the head of the paragraph , and then back this up with a strong array of facts .

		The makers of history are also reduc - ing it to an economic basis , demanding that our education be made '' practical , '' that is , made to serve the economic needs of the people .

		One of the most enthusiastic and deter - mined of the economic interpreters is Pro- fessor
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	, whose `` Economic Interpretation of the Constitution '' appeared more than two years ago .

		The method used in this earlier volume has now been followed in tracing the economic influences back of the formation of parties .

		In his earlier volume , the author reached the conclusion that the Constitution '' was a product of a struggle between capitalistic and agrarian interests , '' the financiers , public creditors , traders , manu - facturers , and allied groups being for it , the farmers and debtors being prominent among the opponents .

		This line of cleavage , he says , never was obliterated , and marks the real line of difference between the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans .

		a view which runs counter to that of some other investiga - tors of this period .

		In proof of this thesis .

		Professor Beard submits an array of evidence .

		One is that maps showing a political reversal in certain localities between
1788	DATE	and
1800	DATE	are untrust - worthy , owing to the large increase in the vote .

		For example , in
Boston	LOCATION	only 760 voted to express themselves on the adoption of the Constitution , but more than 3000 voted in
1800	DATE	.

		In several places every man who voted in

Adams	PERSON	, and still
Jefferson	PERSON	would have won .

		Men of that day thought that parties were growing up .

		and lamented this fact .

		No member of the convention who opposed the Constitution ever went into the Federalist camp , while six oppo - nents went into the Republican camp and later were joined by twelve who had favored adoption .


Hamilton	PERSON	was the high priest of the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralists .

		His theorv was that men could be governed only by force or interest .

		Force was out of the question in
America	LOCATION	.

		With the gradual development of his fiscal policy , the line of cleavage was brought into bolder relief , for men began to align themselves accord - ing to their interests .

		From the musty rec - ords of the treasury department , hitherto little used ,
Professor Beard	ORGANIZATION	has shown that of the fourteen senators who voted for the fund - ing bill , eleven were security holders .

		Of the twelve who voted against it , five were security holders , but three held only small amounts .

		Of the thirty-two representatives who voted for assumption of the state debts , twenty-one were security holders , while only eight known security holders voted against it .

		these lat - ter , with one or two exceptions , coming from states where the holdings amounted to very little .

		An examination of the Republican and Federalist controversial literature of the period also leads to the conclusion that eco - nomic interests were at the bottom of party divisions .

		The writers do indeed name politi - cal differences ; but even such authorities as
John Taylor	PERSON	and
John Marshall	PERSON	, representa - tives of the different parties , speak of the division as due to the conflict between the capitalistic and the agrarian classes .

		That economic interests were largely instru - mental in causing divisions on foreign affairs has been pretty well recognized : yet even here Professor Beard sheds new light , espe - cially in showing why
Virginia	LOCATION	, which im - ported more goods than
New York	LOCATION	or most of
New England	LOCATION	, opposed the Jay treaty and , in general , sided against
England	LOCATION	.

		In the '' great battle of
1800	DATE	'' the question of personal freedom , which had been threat - ened by the alien and sedition laws , undoubt - edly played a part ; but both parties frankly fought on the economic issue .

		That , in gen - eral , the line of division left `` wealth and talent '' on one side , and the agrarian inter - ests on the other , is shown by conclusive evi - dence drawn from all sorts of sources , such as histories , monographs , pamphlets , news - papers , manuscripts , and election returns in many localities .

		Even the Southern slave - holders needed to be assured that they had nothing to fear from
Jefferson	PERSON	, who was known to be an abolitionist .

		What is the significance of all this ruthless iconoclasm ?

		Are we to believe that the Fathers were utterly sordid and corrupt , seeking only the advancement of their own interests ?

		By no means .

		It is yet to be proved that they were any more self-seeking than are the statesmen of to-day .

		Many of them had an eve to the main chance in the 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	funding and bank bills ; but who will deny that the country profited immensely through these acts ?

		It would be very difficult indeed to prove that the Fathers profited more in proportion than later statesmen who voted for their own and their country 's welfare in many ways , for example , in the bills for
Pacific	LOCATION	railroads and in tariff bills for the protection of `` infant industries . ''

		At least they were not '' eating one another , '' as
Jefferson	PERSON	said they were doing in
Europe	LOCATION	, where persons were '' piled upon one another in large cities , '' and as we would be doing here if that condi - tion arose .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The novels for
1916	DATE	have begun long before one has finished the novels of
1915	DATE	, and in plunging into them one must leave unnoticed many good things of the year gone by .

		If the first appearances are any sign of the sea - son , the coming year is going to be a strenu - ous one .

		Mr.
H. K. Webster	PERSON	in `` The Real Adventure , '' and Mr.
W. L. George	PERSON	in '' The Strangers ' Wedding , '' have both published books on the subject of marriage , books with an idea , '' books that make you think , '' as they say now , or rather did a few years ago .

		The reader must not only enjoy the bounty as he may find it , but he must also regulate or rearrange his notions of sociology .

		This last is , of course , not so hard , for presumably few of us have anything in the way of sociological notions more definitely fixed than the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope , so that a few shakes do not mean as much as might seem .

		It will be a new experience to many to meet with Mr.
Webster	PERSON	as a real `` student of the great problems of our day , '' or whatever else one likes to call people who do what he is doing now .

		And it is otherwise hard to give him a fair chance in reading his new book , for it comes before us so enswathed in bewil - dering advertisement and iridescent publicity that the real thing is not obvious .

		Nor under the best of circumstances is the real
Webster	PERSON	obvious , for he has been developing his lit - erary ability for the last ten or a dozen years , in conditions which to a lesser man would surely have been fatal .

		He began with a fine and original idea , namely , that in the great industrial enterprises of the

		That true romance neither he nor any of his numerous followers has succeeded in putting into lasting form ; and failing -LRB- it would seem -RRB- to realize his early ideal , Mr.
Webster	PERSON	has thrown himself into the current possibilities of bookmaking with a success that may be as gratifying to him as it has been to thousands of admirers .

		Now , however , he seems to collect himself and make a try at something which he thinks more worth while .

		If a man can succeed in such an effort , his success should certainly have a hearty welcome .

		Everyone knows that Mr.
Webster	PERSON	has very great ability in seeing interesting possibilities in the confusions of current life , and in tell - ing a story so that one will want to read it to the end .

		It is perhaps less generally recog - nized that he has no especial gift for conceiv - ing and rendering character , or for suggest - ing the spirit of time and plaee .

		In '' The Real Adventure '' he takes himself much as he is ; his book embodies interesting phases of current life , and when one has got once started it is certainly interesting .

		I do not make so much of the characters ; they seem to me little more than abstractions suggested by ideas that are very common nowadays .

		The delightful beauty who readily becomes a successful designer of stage costumes , the keen corporation lawyer who deals so excel - lently with big cases that he piles up enor - mous fees , the alienist who knows absolutely everything about the human mind , the theatri - cal producer who brings glittering success out of sordid chaos , these people seem to me , not mere puppets , but hardly the real thing .

		One follows out the story rather with the feel - ing that here are a man and woman doing so and so , as they work out an interesting prob - lem in married life .

		It is not that one has two absolute people living among others of their kind , and doing what seemed obvious or necessary .

		The problem remains ab - stract , still a problem ; one has always to decide whether she was right or wrong , and so on .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's whole course of lit - erary life makes this sort of thing natural to him .

		His young lady in one place refers to the novels of Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	as though they stood for an impossibly wonder - ful world , and the remark makes one think that Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's own world is not so very different .

		It is too splendid a world for ordi - nary people : we should be lost in it , at least I should .

		I could not stand the pace for a minute : I should feel awkwardly silent in the brilliant conversation of those delightful dinners : I should find myself pushed into a corner at the thought even of those glorious
1916	DATE	j THE DIAL 215 compellers ef success .

		The atmosphere is too bracing , too smart , too superlative .

		All that makes it rather hard to take the book seriously .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	certainly does one thing worth doing : he takes the real woman 's view .

		Not that all women would do just what his heroine did .

		of course not ; few would do such things , and not many more would approve of them .

		But a woman would understand why she does what she does , why she feels as she is said to feel .

		The problem is still abstract , but the point of view is right .

		And that -LRB- when it comes to thinking -RRB- is a very important thing .

		One wants to look at the problem rightly ; after all , the sociological thinker has to abstract his ideas from the con - crete realities of fiction .

		Should he not be glad to have the author do the abstracting for him ?

		Perhaps he would , though one might ask .

		`` Why the novel ?

		Mr.
George	PERSON	is of course a different sort of person from Mr.
`` Webster	PERSON	: he is much more of a student of social conditions ; he writes novels , one is told , to diffuse his social and philosophical ideas .

		He is a student of the nature of women and of society in general .

		He comes to his novel from the opposite side .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	knows all one could desire about making novels , and about sociology he knows what he has gathered by general or special ; observation .

		When , a few years ago , Mr.
George	PERSON	turned from journalism to fiction he i had given careful study to economic prob - lems , and knew in a practical way as much about making novels as anybody else on the outside .

		So one has rather a different feeling about his handling of problems and questions and such things .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	deals with a very different world from that of Mr.
Web	PERSON	- ster .

		the world of the East End of
London	LOCATION	.

		And the average reader is less familiar with the life of poor people in
London	LOCATION	than he is ; with the life of rich people in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Still > one guesses that Mr.
George	PERSON	is a little super - lative , too , not sumptuous but still rather exciting .

		Few of us have the experience necessary to estimate the truth to life of the evening wherein a man comes up from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	to
Paddington	LOCATION	.

		dines unwisely and too well with three Oxford men , goes to the `` Euro - pean '' rather flushed , goes somewhere after - ward in a cab with a lord proverbially drunk and two -LRB- perfect -RRB- ladies , is thrown out of the somewhere into the street minus his watch , sees
London	LOCATION	wake , asks a tramp to have a cup of coffee and finds him dead .

		It may l > e abso - lutely true truth , but at first it is a little exhilarating .

		Afterward the atmosphere is less exciting -LRB- or is it that we get used to it ? -RRB-

		, ; and we follow with appreciation Mr.
Roger Huncote	PERSON	as he goes to the
St. Panwich Lay Settlement	ORGANIZATION	, and in course of time marries '' a girl of the people . ''

		The last part of the book tells how they got on together .

		If Mr.
George	PERSON	has a problem or an idea -LRB- and I presume he has ; I think I get it -RRB- , he has been most successful in embodying it in forms of life .

		The life that he presents is not familiar to me -LRB- except in snatches -RRB- , and yet I think I see how exactly this and that must have happened .

		This daughter of a washer - woman who marries a gentleman , how natu - ral seems everything that she does , from putting on all her jewels at her first dinner and going upstairs to take them off when she observes that the other women do not wear so many , to her sudden escape to
Ramsgate	ORGANIZATION	where she gets kissed by a stray man with whom she falls into acquaintance .

		The book is full of life ; in fact , it is not at all obvious just what idea there is in it .

		This is quite delightful .

		one can read it without any notion of idea .

		It is not tremendously solid , it leaves out a good deal : one has little idea what this man and woman did all day to fill up the time .

		It does seem a little casual that within a year after marriage he should be taking up vague golf-sticks and going off to spend the day with no apparent interest in what his wife might be doing at home .

		But a novelist can not tell everything , and Mr.
George	PERSON	tells a great deal .

		One of these books supplements the other .

		In `` The Great Adventure '' the woman feels that married life , as she and her husband understand it .

		puts her in an unworthy posi - tion .

		With all the devoted love between her - self and her husband , she feels that she needs to be something really different from what she is .

		She says at first that she is practically a mistress , a prostitute .

		When she comes to have some personal acquaintance with mis - tresses and prostitutes , she feels that that was a very crude and unjust way of putting things ; but still she feels that the true mar - ried life demands more than the kind of love she and her husband seem to have . ''

		The Strangers ' Wedding '' presents a man and a woman who love each other so that , in spite of immense difference in character and habits and education , they are sometimes absolutely united in spirit .

		Sue .

		the daughter of the
London	LOCATION	washerwoman , has none of the ideas of Rose , the daughter of the American femi - nist .

		She does not argue about these things at all ; but she does subtly feel , and so does her husband , as time goes on .

		that the passion - ate bond between them is not enough ; even their most perfect reconciliations are not per - manent .

		Rose , with a clear head and a loving 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	heart , devises a remedy , and carries it through in spite of its drastic necessities .

		Sue does not .

		One should read both books .

		Such things are interesting and absorbing , but it is a pleasure to turn for just a moment to Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's latest book is a collection of stories written a few years ago ; nor is any one of these stories as fine as his best .

		But it is a pleasure to have something else by him for all that .

		It is not that one wants to get away from sordid or splendid conditions to exotic adventures and wide horizons ; for in Mr.
Webster	PERSON	and Mr.
George	PERSON	we have quite as desperate adven - tures and quite as alluring horizons as may be found in the Seven Seas .

		Nor is it that it is a relief to get away from problems and ideas , for in Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	there is usually a deeper problem and a more determined idea even than whether women ought to be independent in marriage or whether it is wise to marry `` out of one 's class . '

		, ' It is perhaps that in Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's stories there is almost always a vital intensity , an absolute originality , which one recognizes at once and likes .

		These sto - ries give us some of those cross-purposes and misfits which seem to make up the detail of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's view of life , but they give them to us so that we recognize that what they give us is life .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The '' Essays in Social Justice '' em * by Professor
T. N. Carver	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, will pro- vide wholesome food for thought to many who are feeling out toward a better under - standing of the vexing and perplexing prob - lems that face society .

		But for an obvious obsession with the Malthusian doctrine on the part of the writer , and an apparent lingering belief in the outworn wage-fund theory , there is little in the book with which the most lib - eral and advanced political thinker could quarrel .

		Professor
Carver	PERSON	betrays his Mal - thusian leanings in the reiterated affirmation that '' economic scarcity '' is the dominating factor in the regulation of human relation - ships ; and this inevitably invites the opposi - tion of a reader who has had opportunities for observing that the worst periods of destitu - tion and social misery have coincided with those in which the granaries have been over - stocked with food-stuffs and the warehouses stacked ceiling-high with clothing , for all of which their owners were eagerly seeking con - sumers .

		In his repeated suggestions , again , that by abstaining from consumption and investing one 's savings in the purchase of real capital , i. e. tools , one can best benefit society , we seem to hear an echo of the old theory , dead and buried as was thought , that the pos - sible employment of labor is limited by the amount of capital in circulation .

		The popula - tion theory and the wage-fund doctrine have been too completely discredited to admit of a modern reader reconsidering with patience a revival of them in any shape .

		One regrets the more that the author should thus have invited opposition in the opening chapters of his book , on finding in the later essays a suffi - ciently clear elucidation of the root causes of that which distresses us all , the persistence of poverty amidst abounding wealth .

		There is something not only original but singularly convincing in the way in which Professor
Carver	PERSON	diagnoses the economic maladjust - ments and disharmonies in society , and traces them to a cause which , when pointed out , vin - dicates itself as the true one .

		If to produce a given result in sufficient quantity , the writer argues , various factors are necessary , it is evi - dent that a restriction of the supply of one of the factors will restrict the quantity of the product , and to the extent of that restriction render the unbalanced surplus of the other factors useless or superfluous . ''

		The first problem in any system of distribution is to search for the limiting factor or factors . ''

		Here is the central thought upon which the essay on '' The Cure for Poverty '' turns .

		It is shown as the pivot on which `` the law of diminishing returns '' revolves .

		Its universal bearing on the problems of vocational train - ing , and on the distribution in their proper proportions of administrative ability and un - skilled labor , is revealed in a way that carries conviction .

		The light that flows from the idea of the limiting factor in production is thrown upon the inevitable effect of withholding land from use , in a manner that will satisfy the most radical of sociologists .

		If a reviewer could feel justified in fault-finding with so excellent a book , he might perhaps suggest that the author , in common with many other sociological writers , betrays a lack of faith in the tendency of human affairs to go right of themselves under conditions of freedom .

		The true spirit of democracy lies in the stubborn conviction that if a solid sub-stratum of jus - tice can be discovered in '' equality of oppor - tunity , '' the various factors in the production of social harmony may be trusted to sort themselves out and arrange themselves in right proportions , without regimentation or external aid of any kind .

		Of such , therefore , is the substance of the book , a precious fragment of the designed but never completed larger autobiographic volume we should like to have had from Dr.
Willis	PERSON	's pen .

		He died nearly two years ago at the age of eighty-four , with more of varied experience and of association with noted men and women to look back upon than falls to the lot of many .

		In its unstudied , frank , and intimate way , his recollection of the
Concord	LOCATION	celebrities who helped to mould his character at the impres - sionable period of his life is a pleasing aid to our visualization of those celebrities .

		.4 compendium Of the numerous books on Amer - for American -LCB- can '' preparedness . ''

		Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric Huidekopers '' The Military Unpreparedness of the United States '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is the most ambitious and , as it seems to us .

		the best .

		It is a massive volume , chiefly devoted to the military history and policy of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The portion dealing with the subject up to
1862	DATE	is a recasting of
Upton	PERSON	's well known book , the portion since that date is original .

		The whole is abundantly buttressed with tables , references , and notes , and repre - sents a tremendous amount of labor .

		The author 's purpose is to urge the need of greater land forces .

		Five chapters are given to the lessons of our wars , and some of the conclu - sions are that the regular army has always been too small , never properly organized , and invariably without adequate reserves ; that the enlistment period has been foolish , and recruit - ing has been made worse by the bounty sys - tem ; that too much reliance has been placed on raw troops , causing needless protraction of our wars and corresponding expense : that adequate equipment was never on hand when war began ; that war can not be conducted effi - ciently unless a government wields its power despotically , that is .

		without a general staff .

		Mr.
Huidekoper	PERSON	's programme calls for a regu - lar army of 250.000 men , a reserve to the regular army of 420,000 , besides a continental army and the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He also urges the necessity of organizing our national re - sources , enlarging the military academy , increasing the number of officers , extending the system of military training camps , keeping track of all available men , and placing mili - tary finance under a budget system .

		The effect of such a system , and its compatibility with American ideals , is not seriously dis - cussed .

		Indeed , these are questions which may quite properly be excluded from a book of this character , which is concerned solely with the military factors of the case .

		But , though excluded from the book , they can not be ignored in life .

		The adoption of the reforms here advocated would mean a change in the American point of view .

		This point of view may now be wrong , indeed , this book con - tends in effect that it is .

		But when the objec - tion to our former ideals comes from military circles , and when our life and system are to be transformed to meet conditions determined by men with the martial point of view , we can not ignore the fact that it represents a genuine change in our conceptions of the rela - tion of the military to the civil power , and of the functions of the latter in our institutions .

		When national defence becomes the pivot on which our national life turns , we shall have something fundamentally different ; and this is a circumstance that we can not afford to ignore .

		An '' hontst
Shortlv	PERSON	after the termination .

		_ of the active career of
Joseph ' Chamberlain	PERSON	, ten years ago , there was added to the growing list of biogra - phies of the statesman an interesting and well informed study by Mr.
Alexander Mackintosh	PERSON	.

		A revised and enlarged edition of Mr.
Mack	PERSON	- intosh 's book , under the title ''
Joseph Cham	PERSON	- berlain : An Honest Biography '' -LRB-
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		has lately appeared .

		Biographies of
Chamberlain	PERSON	fall into three groups .

		The first consists of those in which , despite its apparent glaring incongruities , the career of the man is depicted as being fundamentally 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	consistent .

		The second consists of those in which the virtue -LRB- if it be one -RRB- of consistency is entirely denied and the man is represented as a politician of life-long ambition who having failed in one course recklessly tried another .

		The third group is represented by Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	's book , wherein it is shown that '' the changes in Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's case were unusually numerous and violent , that they affected nearly every great secular sub - ject discussed in his time , and that they occurred not only in the judgments of his youth , but in those of his mature and ripe manhood ; but wherein , also , the writer , in - stead of pronouncing a verdict upon the motives involved , undertakes simply to ` pre - sent the whole case to the jury . ' ''

		Having watched Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	from the gallery of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	for a full quarter - century , and having made a diligent study of his subject , the author should have been in a position to submit the facts both accurately and fully .

		And it must be said that , on the whole , he has lived up to his opportunity .

		Praise is accorded here and censure there , but most of the time the narrative flows unob - structed by the intrusion of personal opinion .

		Appended to the biography proper is a col - lection of the statesman 's more noteworthy expressions of opinion on political matters , arranged in parallel columns so that the reader may observe at a glance the contrasts which appear in utterances of different dates .

		It may be presumed that the pronouncements of most political leaders who have been long be - fore the public could be culled with results also more or less startling .

		And no judgment concerning the honesty , or even the con - sistency , of any person should be arrived at from the contemplation of disjointed data of this character .

		If utilized in close conjunc - tion with his text , Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	's exhibit of '' Chamberlainiana '' is useful ; otherwise it is misleading .

		The whimsical Baffling at first , and somewhat monologue of a so to the end , is the whimsical I n of moods .

		monologue entitled '' The
Solilo	PERSON	- quy of a Hermit , '' by Mr.
Theodore Francis Powys	PERSON	.

		Not exactly a hermit does he show himself to be , after all , for he walks and talks with his fellow-men and manifests a lively interest in the world about him .

		Better might he have called his book '' The Soliloquy of a Satirist , '' since satire of a delightful sort crops out on almost every page .

		Of a cer - tain Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	-LRB- though that is not his real name -RRB- who inhabits a red house in the village of
Blank	ORGANIZATION	, the author writes : '' I can not say that I think that God has expressed His di - vine purpose very well in this kind of a man , a man that does not even know how to treat a tradesman , and who will thank a porter for doing what he is paid to do . ''

		And of himself , his chief theme , he says : '' I take my life as I find it , and live it to myself as everyone does .

		As I am a priest , I never give anything away ; it is a natural law of my nature not to give , but always to receive . ''

		Then he amusingly relates with ostensible frankness an incident illustrating his own alleged stinginess .

		Again , in characteristic vein , he writes : '' It is much better , I have found , to love a chair than to love a person ; there is often more of God in a chair . ''

		The fiction of his priesthood is humorously main - tained through the book .

		`` Avoid the good ones , '' he counsels little children , near the close of his soliloquy , '' and go and dance with those that take and eat honestly the lion 's share .

		We know that Lion ; there is some - thing honest and open about him ; the immor - tal laughters surround him as he gambols and frolics in new-mown hay . ''

		Truly , a satirist and humorist of a different kidney from the ordinary sort is this companionable hermit .

		There is many a chuckle in his little book .

		popularizing Counted by centuries , the his - Engiish tory of English law is a long one .

		Only special students of the subject are familiar with the story of how , out of beginnings crude and fortuitous , there has emerged after a thousand years the pres - ent status of acts , principles , - and procedure which combine to make up the British consti - tution .

		An account of these legal institutions has usually been regarded as attractive only to that rare student of the law who would enrich his professional training by a knowl - edge of the complex historical processes which created it .

		The ever-widening reach , of the curriculum , however , might very reasonably admit an introduction to a side of national development so interesting and fundamental as the evolution of English law and judica - ture .

		The absence of convenient aids for the purpose has doubtless been a leading obstacle to such instructors of English history and politics as were disposed to supplement their course-requirements with knowledge of a legis - lative character .

		Professor
James F. Colby	PERSON	, of the
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	law school , has helped to supply the gap by the publication of `` A Sketch of English Legal History '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		He has brought together a series of articles on the history of English law con - tributed a few years since to

		The editor has supplemented many pages of the text with footnotes , consisting for the most part of carefully selected ex - cerpts from the more elaborate works of
Pollock	LOCATION	and
Maitland	PERSON	and of Professor Ed - ward
Jenks	PERSON	.

		The text itself is written in language sufficiently clear and untechnical to interest the general reader and the student of English history .

		It presents the continuity of English legal development from the
Saxon	PERSON	`` Dooms '' of
Ethelbert	LOCATION	.

		Ine , and
Alfred	PERSON	to the Insurance Act of
1911	DATE	.

		The first three chapters consider the genesis of the earliest
Saxon	PERSON	codes , the
Norman	PERSON	adaptation of these and their conversion from the vernacular into the Latin language ; certain borrowings from the canon law of the church , the origin of trial by jury in the Frankish missi , and the foundation of the common law by the king 's judges , beginning with
Henry II	PERSON	.

		The rest of the narrative embraces an account of the de - velopment of statutory forms , of the lawyer class , and judicial procedure .

		Few books give so forceful an impression of the real character of the English people .

		Their lack of idealism in things legal appears from their practical satisfaction with what is customary .

		Never - theless , English law with the lapse of time has evolved wonderfully beneficent changes .

		It has preferred not to expedite its career through ; the light of theory , or to borrow freely from sources foreign to its own experience .

		Pro- fessor
Colby	PERSON	has distinctly served the needs of education by the publication of these valuable articles in a single volume , together with his own useful selection of supplementary notes , chapter-references for further reading , and appendices containing the laws of Ethelbert and extracts from various sources and com - mentaries .

		If the author had any preponderant purpose in writing the book , it must have been that of \ disabusing his readers ' minds of commonly prevailing notions concerning the forbidding features of this little-visited section of the world .

		In the first place , he describes in detail the preparations made by himself and his wife for the contemplated journey , and gives prae - j tical advice to the prospective traveller , laying much emphasis upon the kindliness of the peo - ple who will be encountered and the generally satisfactory character of the means of trans - portation and of entertainment in such regions as have any considerable population .

		In the next place , he describes the economic develop - ment which is in progress in great districts eastward from the
White Sea	LOCATION	to north-central
Siberia	LOCATION	the opening of oil-fields , the exten - sion of the lumber industry , the building of railroads , and the growth of trade .

		And , finally , he pictures , with moderation yet with earnestness , the future settlement and utiliza - tion of vast territories which the world gener - ally supposes to be altogether ill-adapted to the support of a substantial civilization .

		Among existing cities and towns whose ap - pearance and life are described with some full - ness are Archangel , Solovetz .

		.

		Dealing as it does only with the Russian '' far north , '' the volume sup - plements in a useful manner the various books of Russian travel in which attention is given almost exclusively to other portions of the Muscovite dominion .

		The illustrations , from photographs by the author , are many and excellent .

		Colonization as the source of war .

		Several well written and sugges - tive but loosely related essays make up the first part of Mr.
Walter Lippmann	PERSON	's `` The Stakes of Diplo - macy '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The core of the book , however , consists of the second part , in ' which are dis - cussed the causes of strife between nations and the remedies therefor .

		With convincing skill it is pointed out that trouble between nations usually arises in the backward parts of the earth , where the powers are competing for advantage .

		These parts are designated as '' arenas of conflict . ''

		Conflicts in this field are often not susceptible of arbitration because they involve a nation 's prestige ; and no nation will consent to a diminution of its posi - tion by anything short of force , if for no other reason than that any concession would weaken its chances when the next difference arises .

		Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	proposes joint control by the powers of these arenas of conflict .

		A basis for this suggestion he finds in the arrangements made for the
Congo	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	, and in the Alge - ciras Conference in
1905	DATE	.

		He would have the conferences which settle international ques - tions as they arise continue as international commissions to control the execution of such conventions as are agreed upon .

		Thus , there would in due time be a number of international commissions , each charged with some interna - tional problem .

		Though no doubt a fruit of Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	's independent thinking , his proposal is by no means a new one .

		It is noth - 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	ing other than the
Zweckverband	LOCATION	which
Alfred Fried	PERSON	of
Vienna	LOCATION	has been urging these past twenty years .

		Indeed , the proposal has been an actual fact for some decades in the
Danube River Commission	LOCATION	; and the principle was ap - plied in the joint administration of
Crete	LOCATION	and
Samoa	LOCATION	, in the control of the Ottoman Debt , and as noted by the author in the
Congo	LOCATION	, not to mention other instances .

		The value of Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	's book lies not in its originality , but in its popularization and advocacy of the soundest method so far discovered for stopping war at its chief source .

		The first volume of the now Huntresses of the insect tamous Souvenirs Entomolo - giques '' forms the fifth one in the series of translations by Mr.
Alexander Teixiera de Mattos	PERSON	of the works of the illus - trious French naturalist ,
Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		It appears under the title , `` The Hunting Wasps '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and it includes an account of
Fabre	PERSON	's observations on the remarkable habits and instincts of those soli - tary wasps whose larvae are hidden in bur - rows in the earth , and whose larder the mother stocks with insects , with rare beetles of a particular species , with crickets , grass - hoppers , or with caterpillars .

		Each species of wasp selects a particular kind of prey , which it prepares for underground storage by paralyzing each victim upon capture by sting - ing it in the appropriate nerve centres .

		The helpless captive is thus unable to resist the forays of the delicate larva or to do violence to it .

		Fabre 's ingenious experiments demon - strate that this habit rests upon a series of complicated instincts , coming into function in a more or less rigid sequence , which the parent faithfully continues to the end although the experimenter 's interference has visibly robbed the operation of all value .

		Instinct thus knows everything in the undeviating paths marked out for it ; it knows nothing outside those paths .

		The book includes a discussion of the modern or evolutionary theory of in - stinct , which the author 's observations do not lead him to support .

		With keen rapier thrusts , he finds the weak spots in the elder
Darwin	PERSON	's observations on these insects , and with relentless argument and array of facts he undermines
Darwin	PERSON	's argument for the origin of the reasoning faculty from such fixed instincts .

		The author also pleads at length for the existence of an unknown sixth sense , beyond human experience , to explain some of the unerring and remarkable percep - tions of these wasps .

		While his criticisms of the evolutionary significance of the provision - ing instinct may well give us pause , in view of his extensive and critical observations , and make us re-examine our glib explanations of these extraordinary phenomena , it is doubtful if this suggestion of a mysterious unknown sense will bear the test of modern physiologi - cal experimentation .

		This volume will be of particular interest to American readers be - cause of the more recent investigations of Dr. and Mrs. ,
Peckham	PERSON	on the American hunting - wasps .

		The subject is itself full of novelty and unfailing interest , and is of fundamental scientific importance as illustrating one of the most highly specialized and complicated series of instincts thus far observed .

		In the hands of this master observer , these are revealed to the reader in simple yet remarkably accurate fashion , with loving enthusiasm and the zest of conquest , and with a dramatic power un - rivalled in the literature of natural history .

		The essence of the lectures on outlines of Belgian history delivered last Belgian history .

		r -LRB- \ ' winter at the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago by
M. Leon Van der Essen	ORGANIZATION	, visiting pro- fessor from
Louvain	LOCATION	, is now made available to a wider public in the '' Short History of
Belgium	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In no sense a '' war book , '' it traces the story of the provinces which form the modern state of
Belgium	LOCATION	from the time when
Cassar	PERSON	declared that the
Belgac	PERSON	were the bravest of all the Gauls to the death of Leopold II -LRB- 57 B.C.
1910	DATE	A. D. -RRB- .

		In his preface the author states his belief that a knowledge of the past history of his country may help to a clearer under - standing of '' why the Belgian nation of
today	DATE	took the stand it has taken in the great war and preferred honor in place of dishonor , and struggle for freedom in place of ease . ''

		He concludes with the hope that the reader may find historical support for the belief dear to Belgian hearts to-day : Belgians never can be slaves . ''

		The national culture of
Belgium	LOCATION	is a synthesis , if I may so call it , where one finds the genius of two races the Romance and the Germanic mingled , yet modified by the imprint of the distinctively Belgian .

		It is in that very receptivity the fact that it has absorbed and unified the best elements of Latin and Teutonic civilization that the originality of the Belgian national culture resides . ''

		Belonging thus by race to two nationalities , the whole history of
Belgium	LOCATION	has been a struggle for independence : first that of the communes to win recognition of their rights from feudal lords ; that of
Lotha	LOCATION	- ringia to free itself from
Germany	LOCATION	; and that of Flanders to shake off the fetters of
France	LOCATION	.

		United in the fifteenth century under the dukes of
Burgundy	LOCATION	, these provinces had still
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 221 to struggle against the Spanish , the Austrian , the French , and finally the Dutch rule , and won recognition as an independent and per - petually neutral state in
1830	DATE	.

		A single epi - sode must suffice to show the temper of the people .

		In the twelfth century the Count of
Hainaut	LOCATION	, a loyal partisan of Emperor Fred - erick
Barbarossa	PERSON	, maintained that his first duty was to his county .

		In a war between
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	he declared that `` he was not obliged to put his fortresses in the hands of the imperial troops and to grant them passage through his territory , as that would bring devastation to his country .

		His country being located between
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, he ought to remain neutral during this war . ''

		We are irresistibly reminded of Verhaeren 's verses , '' Je suis le fils de cette race Tenace , Qui veut , apres avoir voulu Encore , encore et encore plus . ''

		, unorthodoxy , naughtiness , and many others equally inviting .

		It is a book for the odd moments of leisure , not for continuous reading .

		Although three of its pages are ' dev t e < l to `` Books in War - Time , '' the collection of `` Mod - ern Essays '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- reprinted from the editorial columns of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' is agreeably and intentionally free from matter of only ephemeral significance .

		As Professor
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	says in introducing the book , `` the ` third leaders ' in The Times of which this volume is a selection are meant .

		.

		to turn the reader from affairs and interests of the moment to a consideration ' of man , of nature , and of human life ' in their larger , more per - manent aspect . ''

		Like the essays of the '' Spectator , '' '' Tatler , '' '' Rambler , '' and their kind , these later bits of daily observation and reflection are made to measure and according to a pre-arranged plan , maintaining a remark - able similarity of style and structure under a diversity of authorship .

		Occasional classical allusions or quotations betray , most wel - comely , the university man behind the pen .

		Many of
England	LOCATION	's famous authors have served an apprenticeship , after leaving Ox - ford or
Cambridge	LOCATION	, on one or another of the great
London	LOCATION	journals , to the advantage of all concerned .

		Thus it is not improbable that many or perhaps most of these well-written leaders are the work of promising young uni - versity men of whom the world will hear more in the future and in less anonymous fashion .

		To tempt the reader , let a few headings from the book 's contents be here dis - played .

		The essays treat of such themes as curiosity , ugliness , paradox , charlatans , prig - gishness , childishness , grumbling , the Latin genius , practical jokes , philosophy and poetry .

		Luther ' ' works in English dress .

		Probably Martin Luther comes nearer than any of his country - men to being the typical Ger - man .

		It was his ambition and his pride to be and to speak '' deutsch . ''

		He seems to have had a keen sense of the primitive meaning of this word , which is , `` of the people , '' `` ver - nacular . ''

		That he was so thoroughly German does not make it more difficult to interpret him to the English world , since the two stocks and languages are so closely kin .

		Considering the persistent vitality of so much of Luther 's mes - sage to the world , even to the modern world , it is a cause of congratulation that a group of Lutheran scholars have undertaken to pre - sent a large portion of the reformer 's work to the English public .

		There are to be ten vol - umes , of approximately four hundred pages each ; and it would seem that this is none too little space for the well informed general reader to give on his shelves to so significant a ; force in the world 's development .

		The two volumes already issued extend only to the year
1522	DATE	, and include , therefore , theological essays chiefly ; although not a few of these , such as the famous Address to the German Nobility , touch problems of life and society that are still vital .

		Luther was a splendid heretic socially as well as religiously , and his utterances on profit-taking -LRB- Wucher -RRB- and commerce , on the duties of rulers , on the rights of citizens , though often biased by a peculiar clerical myopia , will give the upholders of the estab - lished order little satisfaction .

		Rather let it be said that advocates of some of the most | promising reforms of our day in the direction of true Christianity will find his writings a rich armory of offence and defence .

		The !

		translators have done work worthy of their 1 subject , as have also the publishers Messrs.
A. J. Holman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION , Up to the present .

		Middle English literature , used as a corpus vile for linguistic dissection , has not taken its rightful place either in our college curricula or in the estimation of the general culti - vated reader .

		To assist in breaking down our prej - udices and removing the difficulties of language , Professor
Cook	PERSON	has prepared a '' Literarv Middle English Reader '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		Here for the first time we have a splendidly comprehensive collection of the actual texts without learned apparatus , save brief introductions and foot-note glossaries .

		Here one with ordinary intelligence may read pre-Eliza - bethan texts primarily for enjoyment .

		This book 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 2	DATE	should do much to bring our students to an enthu - siastic appreciation of much in earlier English literature .

		In a pamphlet of sixty-six pages , '' reprinted for private distribution from '' Papers of the Biblio - graphical Society of
America	LOCATION	, Volume IX , Nos .

		3-4 , '' Mr.
George Watson Cole	PERSON	presents some inter - esting facts about '' Book-Collectors as Benefactors of Public Libraries . ''

		Both voluntarily , either in their lifetime or after their death , and involun - tarily , when their possessions have passed beyond their control , collectors have been the means of preserving for public use thousands of rare and valuable books that would otherwise have been lost to the world .

		Many instances of such benefac - tion are cited by Mr.
Cole	PERSON	, and he adds much re - lated matter concerning the history of books and printing and collecting .

		Portraits of famous book - collectors are inserted , and a convenient '' syllabus '' of the entire treatise is appended .

		The papers read before the Aristotelian Society during the thirty-sixth session , 1914-5 , have been gathered into a volume which is issued by
Messrs. Williams & Norgate	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		Following the ini - tial essay on '' Science and Philosophy '' by Dr.
Bernard Bosanquet	PERSON	are several papers by members of the Society on related subjects .

		They include : '' Notes on
Berkeley	LOCATION	's Doctrine , '' by Professor
C. Lloyd Morgan	PERSON	; '' Conflicting Social Obligations , '' by Mr.
G. D. H. Cole	PERSON	; '' The < ^ Esthetic ' of Bene - detto
Croce	PERSON	, '' by Mr.

F. Aveling	PERSON	.

		The '' Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Dr.
Joseph Thomas	PERSON	, has now after twenty years of usefulness passed into a fourth edition .

		Its merits as a standard work of reference have long been recognized .

		The publishers announce that it has been thoroughly revised ; yet tested in the field of modern literature the following curiosities , among many others , have been disclosed : Booth Tarkington -LRB- American -RRB- is represented as having written nothing later than
1909	DATE	;
John Galsworthy	PERSON	-LRB- English -RRB- , no mention ;
H. G. Wells	PERSON	-LRB- English -RRB- , a list of his novels up to
1908	DATE	'' and many others , '' together with the misleading statement that his novels are highly imaginative in character ;
Selma Lagerlb	LOCATION	' f -LRB- Swedish -RRB- , inadequate mention and name misspelled ;
Herman Sudermann	PERSON	-LRB- German -RRB- , men - tion of one work only , a drama , followed by the worthless , space-filling tag -LRB- dear to every reviser or hack writer of encyclopaedias -RRB- `` his novels were widely read '' ; Remain
Rolland	PERSON	-LRB- French -RRB- ,
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	-LRB- Belgian -RRB- ,
Anton Tchekhoff	PERSON	-LRB- Russian -RRB- , no mention .

		Let us hope we have stumbled upon the weakest link in the chain .

		In fact , we are con - vinced that we have , upon turning to the brief but thoroughly adequate account of President
Wilson	PERSON	, which even includes a reference to his policies of '' watchful waiting '' and '' strict neutrality . ''

NEW YORK	LOCATION	CITY BRILLIANT ESSAYS REPRINTED FROM THE DIAL INCENSE AND ICONOCLASM : Studies in Literature By
CHARLES LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	`` Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	is a writer who needs no introduction to the readers of this jour - nal .

		For a score of years his nicely weighed and admirably judicious essays in miniature upon literary topics have been one of our outstanding features .

		Of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's DIAL essays , thirty - nine have now been collected into a volume entitled ` Incense and Iconoclasm , ' and offer as many examples of the art of saying a great deal within the limits of a narrow space .

		The ` thirty - nine articles ' of this literary confession of faith touch upon most of the major themes of literary criticism , and are notable for their broad views , their penetrative sympathy , and their method of direct approach to the very hearts of their re - spective subjects . ''

		The Dial .

		`` At once in these essays one feels the Amer - ican mind at work with its characteristic direct - ness and singleness of eye ... Each one is packed with ideas so incitingly set forth that they arouse quick response of either agreement or dissent in the reader 's mind ... But the author knows how so to state his idea , perhaps it is because he expresses it so directly and incisively , as to make it strike fire of farther thought , no matter how much skepticism it encounters .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has deep and wide knowledge of English literature , and his judgments show insight , appre - ciation , and that mental quality , said to be char - acteristic of Americans , which we like to call level-headedness .

		And combined with these is that fulness of imaginative flavor without which just and readable literary criticism is impossible . ''

		The Bookman .

		`` Do you know this last book will put you in the very first rank , if not in the lead , of our critics on literature ?

		It is altogether the firmest , broadest , and has the most marching step , so to speak , of anything that has appeared , and should bring you honor , especially from students and teachers of literature , for no one can read your essays and not be conscious of a new light on the pages of the writers whose works and genius you deal with .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		301 The death of
Henry James	PERSON	takes from the literature of our time one of its chief figures .

		A generation ago , when that great movement in favor of seriousness and sincerity called '' realism '' was at its height ,
James	PERSON	was one of the most able and most representative lead - ers .

		He stood for the aims of dozens of the younger writers , for the interests of thou - sands of readers .

		Then came that change in sentiment which followed the earlier work of
Stevenson	PERSON	; then came Kipling ,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, and how many others ; every - one delighted in stories of adventure , of mys - tery , of romance , indeed of all sorts of excite - ment and extravagance .

		The earlier stories were left on one side under the name of ' ' psychology ' ' ; even fine things of the day , like Hardy 's '' Jude the Obscure , '' and the books of
George Gissing	PERSON	and
George Moore	PERSON	, were '' repulsive and depressing . ''

		James was acknowledged a master , but other masters were more alluring .

		Then that enthusiasm waned ; people began to recover themselves as though getting home from some delightful
summer	DATE	holiday ; the charms of Zenda-stories I and of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	paled and were left to the popular magazines .


Arnold Bennett	PERSON	turned from his fantastic imaginations and wrote '' The Old Wives ' Tale '' ; Mr.
Wells	PERSON	turned from his wonderlands of pseudo-science and wrote '' Tono-Bungay . ''

		Once more peo - ple could find interest in the familiar circum - stances of every day .

		A host of younger men sprung up , looking at current life with a fresh but penetrating eye .

		Then it appeared that
Henry James	PERSON	was still the master that he had always been , that his eye for life was as keen and , in spite of his three-score years , as fresh as in earlier days .

		He could do -LRB- as he ; always had done -RRB- what everybody else was now trying to do .

		There was no one who stood as he did among the younger spirits of the day .

		This is a fine and an extraordinary career , and if we have any sense of regret at the de - parture of
Henry James	PERSON	, it is because he did not himself do what he doubtless had in mind and review his own artistic career in its rela - 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	tion to the artistic history of its time .

		The two volumes of his autobiography carried his revaluation of his own life to the point where he was just making his beginnings in what the world thinks of as his life .

		But from that point , though in his recent prefaces he offered many remarks and notes , he never gave a gen - eral estimate of what he knew he had at - tempted and felt he had done .

		Yet , however it might seem to himself , it was plain to all that
James	PERSON	was from the very beginning a master in his art , that he had gone directly on in the path that his genius had made clear to him in spite of the ebbs and flows of popular sentiment , that he was at the end of his life a greater figure even than in those early days when he was felt to be so absolutely fine .

		He had stood always for the same thing , and the currents of the time had turned away from him and run off in various directions , and then had turned to the older ways again , and there had found him going on ahead as he had been all the time while other people had been making a long detour .

		When people began to realize him again , however , they began to realize that he was not the
Henry James	PERSON	whom they had known .

		It might have been that he had changed , it might have been that they had changed ; however it was , many of the earlier admirers of
Henry James	PERSON	could not endure his later works , and most of the admirers of his later works felt that his earlier writing was a little slight or thin .

		There was undoubtedly a change , and it would have been strange had there not been .

		The point of interest was , What was the dif - ference ?

		Was it for better or for worse ?

		Many felt the difference chiefly as it showed itself in the matter of style , in the form of the language , in the way in which
James	PERSON	put in words what he wished to say .

		The latter
James	PERSON	was '' obscure . ''

		This was obviously the case ; indeed , it has been the case with a good many men , with
Walter Pater	PERSON	, for instance , and with
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		In the effort to make the written word more exactly express the movement , often very subtle and growing more subtle with years , of the flow - ing thought , men will sometimes become ob - scure even to those who are used to their earlier writing and their earlier thought .

		But this was not the only thing in
James	LOCATION	's case .

		There was a difference , a complication , not merely in his expression but in his way of looking at things .

		That , too , is often the way with an artist , and that has been so in a large way with the recent development of almost every art .

		In the music , painting , poetry of to-day the technique of any artist is likely to be more complicated -LRB- and so , to many , more obscure -RRB- than the technique of half a century ago .

		It was so with
James	PERSON	both because of his own change in artistic feeling and because of the time in which he lived .

		His earlier work say , ' ' The American ' ' was refined , but it was and was meant to be clear .

		But his later work was often not meant to be clear ; in fact , it was deliberately meant to be not clear , meant to be something else , something that
James	PERSON	-LRB- whatever we may like -RRB- liked better than clearness .

		Along in the nineties his work takes on a quality something like that which he at one time noted in the plays of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, there was an aspect as of twilight in the scene , a feeling almost as of dusk , which reminds one of the delicate , often thrilling , coloration that musicians see in the work of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's contemporary
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	, or indeed of the atmospheric vibra - tion -LRB- not clear even in its brilliancy -RRB- in the landscapes of
Claude Monet	PERSON	.

		In each case the technical means was the same , namely , an addition of notes , of details not called for by the definite outlines of the idea , indeed often not in harmony with them , making a '' richness '' of effect as it was sometimes called , which had its quality , but certainly was not clear .

		But these things , often felt or mentioned , were not everything , and if they had been would have left us far more in doubt as to the true position and value of the work of
Henry James	PERSON	than we need be now .

		These things are technical , even mechanical one is tempted to think ; and however they may make us feel as to
Henry James	PERSON	as an artist , they could hardly have added to our feeling for his general value as a great novelist .

		People , artists as others , do think and feel in such and such a way , doubtless , but in such matters as those we have been speaking of there will always exist in many minds a doubt as to whether that way is good , whether it is really artistic , or often whether the thing said is worth the trouble of such saying , or worth one 's trying to appreciate such complications .

		The real thing was evidently not there , indeed evidently could not be there , for where thought and expression of thought are so
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 261 closely related as in the work of a man like
Henry James	PERSON	, there can never be a question of style alone , unless in the case of minor man - nerisms , which he certainly had like many lesser men , or indeed more than they .

		No , the thing was deeper , and in the way it showed itself was often felt .

		It was not merely that his sentences were complicated , his art complex .

		It was often said that
James	PERSON	seemed to make it his aim not to mention the matter of main importance which he appar - ently set out to speak of .

		If it were a story , he did not tell it ; if it were a situation , he did not say what it was ; if it were an atmos - phere , he did not describe it .

		He seemed to take for granted the very thing one would have thought he meant to say .

		This was something many noticed , and it was explained in various ways .

		It evidently lay deep in
James	LOCATION	's manner of thought , in his way of looking at life .

		Why not say clearly and definitely what is the most important thing ?

		Why , indeed ?

		Who , we may ask , ever does , or ever can in life ?

		There are two ways of thinking of the things of this life , and all of us think some - times in one way , sometimes in the other .

		Sometimes we think of life as made up of a vast number of particular beings who with their combinations and relations are all that there is to think of .

		There may be super - natural beings , but as far as this world is concerned it consists of all sorts of individ - uals , people , animals , stones , cells , electrons , and whatever else we may think of , exist - ing in all sorts of reactions and associations .

		Such is a common enough view , but common also is another .

		We often think that there is a vague something beside all this .

		We think about ourselves that there is something beside the grand total of our actions and reactions ; we think about the combinations of things that there is something beside the things com - bined ; we think of the relations of one thing and another that there is something beside the beings related , and the different phases made up by their interaction .

		Myself and your - self ; family , church , country ; love , honor , patriotism ; these and many other things we feel -LRB- or at least so we often say -RRB- are more than '' mere words . ''

		There is a '' some - thing '' really existent beyond the word .

		Such a statement in a nutshell of two well - known ways of thinking -LRB- and probably each one of us thinks sometimes one way , some - times another -RRB- is to the point just here be - cause it indicates the way
James	PERSON	used to think in his first books and the way he thought in his later books .

		He used to present what peo - ple felt , thought , did , and there was the whole thing .

		But in his later years he had come to feel that in addition to whatever people felt , thought , and did , there was something beyond , and that this something was quite as real as anything else , indeed more real , and so more important .

		If you get that point of view you can read his last novels .

		Many who read them felt that they were but infinitely refined and subtle divagations about things not worth talking about .

		But looked at otherwise , viewed as attempts at making us feel the reality of much that can never be given directly , they were most impressive renderings of life .

		Take '' The Golden Bowl , '' for instance , here we have a very intense and poignant story of something that occurred in the lives of four people .

		Yet the real thing is never absolutely told ; it seems as though it never could be told .

		Everybody seems to take it for granted as it goes on , and two or three times one or another says or does something that makes it absolutely clear as day , or rather as clear as though lit by a flash of lightning .

		But it is never told ; it is there , conditioning or mould - ing or making every act , every word , just what it is , but it is never told .

		People may not like that sort of thing , but after all that is like life itself as we know it , so like life itself that the book as one reads it seems the veriest transcript , and after one reads it the most consummate achievement .

		To do this sort of thing may or may not be great art , but it is certainly to view life in a certain manner .

		And that manner is quite different from the way the earlier gen - eration viewed life , the generation to which
Henry James , Jr.	PERSON	, belonged .


Henry James	PERSON	changed , it would seem ; he remained in the present while his day receded into the past , he remained still of to-day while that day be - came successively yesterday , the day before yesterday , and so on .

		For our day , our '' now '' is very different from that earlier period and mode of art .


Henry James	PERSON	moved on ahead , not following the ideas of his times , but aware of them and keeping well on in the lead .

		New notions and new fashions appeared and disappeared ; he continued in his course .

		262 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	And in time people got back to his line , and then they found him well in advance .

		He had gone forward with other great minds of the time while we had been amusing our - selves .

		That was certainly a great thing to do , a great achievement .

		Few men of our time have done anything like it .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		THE ACADEMIC CONSCIOUSNESS .

		From the interesting collection of neglected commonplaces which modern enlightenment cherishes in theory and disregards in practice may be selected apt texts for public reminder .

		The pertinent one * for the occasion is that professions must determine their standards from within and be responsible for the temper and conditions of service ; of such origin is esprit de corps .

		The ``
American Association of University	ORGANIZATION	Professors '' has been referred to -LRB- commonly by administrative officials of aca - demic institutions -RRB- as the `` Professors ' Union '' ; the jibe may be transformed into a compliment .

		A growing academic conscious - ness is responsible for the organization .

		The saving remnant of the esprit survives in the sensitiveness of professors to any encroach - ment upon `` academic freedom , '' to any limi - tation of speech or professional activity .

		The scholar must be free to think and speak and act by precept and example .

		Gagging is out of fashion ; but tethering is still regarded as a useful device to check excursions into `` un - desirable '' domains .

		The document defining the professors ' conception of `` academic free - dom and academic tenure '' is a notable one ; as a bill of rights , it promises to acquire his - toric importance .

		It sets forth the danger that inheres in any suspicion that `` college and university teachers in general are a re - pressed and intimidated class , who dare not speak with that candor and courage which youth always demands in those whom it is to esteem . ''

		It emphasizes that the professor , although `` with respect to certain external conditions of his vocation , -LSB- he -RSB- accepts a re - sponsibility to the authorities of the institu - tion in which he serves , in the essentials of his professional activity his duty is to the wider public to which the institution itself is morally amenable . ''

		The professor 's opinions must be the `` uncolored product of his own study or that of his fellow specialists '' ; `` they should be conclusions gained by a scholar 's * Apropos of the '' Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure '' issued by
The American Association of University Professors	ORGANIZATION	.


December , 1915	DATE	.

		methods and held in a scholar 's spirit '' ; and more particularly these opinions should not be `` echoes of opinion of the lay public or of the individuals who endow or manage univer - sities . ' '

		The public learns of `` academic freedom '' when a professor loses his place , and the issue is unpleasantly entangled with the conflict of opinion and action between the scholar and the more or less private interests of those responsible for the action .

		In such issues , with commendable vigor and unreserve , the academic consciousness protests , and in recent years protests to a purpose .

		High-handed overriding of these unwritten rights is no longer in favor ; though from time to time , under stress of private or political interests , it is bound to occur .

		As a rule , the '' in - terests '' act more discreetly , and affect opinion that is on its way to affect appropria - tions or endowments .

		It is eminently proper that the first pronouncement of the `` Ameri - can
Association of University	ORGANIZATION	Professors '' should furnish an authoritative statement of the rights and responsibilities of the profes - sion in this aspect of its public service .

		Vital as this issue is , it is but part of a principle of wider scope .

		The true source of grievance is this : that it is `` unsuitable to the dignity of a great profession that the initial respon - sibility for the maintenance of its professional standards should not be in the hands of its own members . ''

		When the academic consciousness is fully awakened , it will proceed to the completion of its programme , and to the removal of the restrictions that beset the
University	ORGANIZATION	career .

		Freedom of speech and security of tenure represent the first steps ; the professor 's fit - ness is to be judged and his advance deter - mined by the judgment of his peers .

		The demand is explicitly made that his removal from office shall follow only upon the verdict of his professional associates .

		The same logic requires that his election to office shall depend likewise upon a professional verdict : and such a step has a far wider bearing than appears .

		For in the actual status , the professor 's opin - ions , labors , and outlook are in danger of being determined not merely by the phase of control expressed by privately elected trus - tees or publicly appointed regents , but more intimately and directly by the phase of au - thority represented by presidents and deans .

		The immediate sense of accountability may not be irksome , while yet it is hampering , and in its morale depressing .

		For , like the more obvious pressure from legal control , it is a rule imposed from without and not developed from within .

		Deans and presidents are con -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 263 spicuously useful officers of institutions of learning ; but whatever be the source of their eonspicuousness , their utility depends entirely upon the manner in which their activities further the academic welfare of the institu - tion .

		No body of men is as capable to judge the value of measures designed to protect and advance the intellectual interests as that re - grettably unorganized group spoken of as the Faculty .

		It should not be within the power of the president to determine whether he shall consult the Faculty or ignore it .

		There is but one adequate way in which the professional responsibility of the professor can be safeguarded ; and that is , to place in his hands the maintenance of professional stand - ards , which implies nothing less than his au - thoritative participation in the control of the institution upon which his career is intimately dependent .

		Faculties must elect their deans and presidents , and not have them imposed upon them from without , even though the choice would frequently fall upon the same men .

		Faculties must determine what types of functions deans and presidents shall perform , so that with the leadership of their executives they shall express a joint wisdom , with a singleness of purpose .

		These steps in the programme may be remote ; but indications of actual movements in that direction are unmistakable .

		They are taking the form of legislation to check the unfor - tunate practice that has grown up unduly , and divided academic opinion into `` adminis - trative '' and '' professorial '' factions .

		The administration represents one type of interests and one cast of mind ; it establishes a peculiar perspective of the desirable and the expedient from one end of the opera-glass ; while the professor -LRB- more loyal to optical principles -RRB- inverts the instrument .

		The practical conse - quence is that the professor -LRB- in spite of his outlook -RRB- thinks one way and votes another ; and his academic consciousness is dissociated more rapidly than it grows together again .

		The attitude of compromise is fatal , not be - cause expediency is always tainted , but because it makes a sham of responsibility .

		As a fact , the professor is encouraged or in - structed or tempted to shift responsibility upon the administration , and will continue to do so until his official rights make it clear to him that , as a member of a respectable profession , it is his duty to exercise the duties of his calling not merely by professing , but by controlling the conditions of his profession .

		The world respects those who respect them - selves .

		The American professor can hardly be said to enjoy the social and public esteem that attaches to his calling in other lands .

		His services are too commonly thought of in clerical fashion ; and the consciousness of his subordination to higher officials and lay direc - tors affects the estimate of his station , and subtly weakens the significance of his posi - tion and his utterances .

		For it takes but little friction to impede , but a slight roughness to dull the edge ; not that the professor is a sensitive plant , but that freedom is .

		The academic declaration of independence is a document yet to be written .

		It will not be a radical one ; but it must be as plain and outspoken as this preamble upon academic freedom , which will bring to many the first i intimation that the ``
American Association of University	ORGANIZATION	Professors '' is an actual consum - mation .

		The professor has become so accus - tomed to be trusteed and deaned and presidented that his initiative , like his prin - ciples , is all tattered and torn .

		His social sense remains ; affiliated with his kind , and strengthened by reinforcements of encourag - ing colleagues , his academic consciousness is certain to revive .

		The `` Professors ' union '' is significant as an organized expression of the survival , through years of needless ac - quiescence in an unreasonable status quo of the academic consciousness .

PARIS	LOCATION	.

		RECENT LOSSES IN FRENCH JOURNALISM .

		THE '' REVUE DBS DEUX MONDES '' AND ITS MANAGE - MENT .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Since the opening of the year , we have lost here in
Paris	LOCATION	three remarkable journalists who were peculiarly interesting from several points of view .

		I refer to Mrs.
Emily Craw	PERSON	- ford ,
M. Francis Charmes	PERSON	, and
M. Robert Mitchell	PERSON	.

		Of the three , the woman was the most picturesque , the most original , and more of the modern journalist , though the mention of this last characteristic does not mean that it is to be considered a special honor ; and in certain directions she was unquestionably superior intellectually to her male confreres , who , however , were men of no ordinary parts .

		| The dissimilarities and the similarities , but I especially the former , between these journal - ists are worth pointing out , particularly as these differences and likenesses were not gen - erally commonplace .

		Though Mrs.
Crawford	PERSON	spent her whole adult life in
Paris	LOCATION	and knew French exceedingly well , she never caught the French accent , and mingled with her spoken French a bit of the brogue of her native Ire - land , which rendered her conversation as racy 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	to the ear as it was to the mind .

		And her ways of thought were as foreign to
France	LOCATION	as was her tongue .

		`` With the years , she seemed even to grow more British and Irish .

		But
Robert Mitchell	PERSON	, though his father was an Englishman and his mother a Spaniard , early became an out-and-out Frenchman .

		He fol - lowed for a time his profession in
London	LOCATION	, which may account for his good command of English , especially spoken English , for he quite forgot every thing Spanish , even his Spanish relatives ; and finally all that was left of the foreigner in him was his name , and even here it was only his patronymic which was not French . ''

		I only wish , '' he said on one occasion , `` that my cognomen were as French as my praenomen , ' ' and he would add that his father once told him that , as the boy was born in
France	LOCATION	and might become a Frenchman , a Christian name which was the same in both languages was purposely chosen .

		`` If I had been baptized
Cadwallader	PERSON	, or
Eliphalet	LOCATION	, or
Humphrey	PERSON	, or Increase , I would promptly have dropped the abomination for humble Jean , or
Jules	PERSON	, or Jacques . ''

		In a word ,
Robert Mitchell	PERSON	was as typically French in thought , manner , and even dress , as Mrs.
Crawford	PERSON	was English in all these respects .

		But the Frenchman was
Francis Charmes	PERSON	.

		He was even almost a Frenchman of the old school , and remained such to the end , though he became a republican , of a moderate type , however , a '' republicain vague , '' as a com - mon friend put it .

		He even carried the trait into a total ignorance of all the modern lan - guages , except the vernacular , and a perfect indifference to foreign travel , he who at - tained high rank as an official in the
French Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, who won the grade of Minister Plenipotentiary , and thought for a moment of entering the active diplomatic service ; he who was an acknowledged authority in
France	LOCATION	and beyond its borders on interna - tional affairs , and who contributed not a little by his pen to mould the foreign relations of his own country and of
Europe	LOCATION	in general .

		And yet the short trips which he very occa - sionally made abroad were confined to Aus - tria ,
Belgium	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, and were , his brother once told me , `` little else than mere pleasure tours , ' ' while the only modern tongue , besides French , of which he had the slightest smat - tering was English , which he could scarcely read and which he never ventured to try to speak .

		I first met Mrs.
Emily Crawford	PERSON	in the
early summer of 1874	DATE	.

		She was then in the prime of life , and was already known in the newspaper world for her remarkably versa - tile qualities .

		At this time she was associated with her husband in all her more important journalistic work , and it is to him that she owed her best training .

		In fact , it is impos - sible to speak of
Emily Crawford	PERSON	's career without giving some space to
George `` W. Crawford	PERSON	.

		He was a man of marked ability .

		He began life as a barrister of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's Inn , where he got to know intimately
Thackeray	PERSON	, who later took him as the model for
George Warrington	PERSON	in `` Pendennis '' ; there are , in - deed , many close resemblances between the pressman of fiction and the pressman of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		When the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News '' was founded by English Liberals as an offset to `` The Times , '' from the very start Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	became its correspondent at the French capi - tal , at a time when the newspaper correspond - i ent , especially the British , was very different from ' ' the bright young man ' ' type of to-day .

		Dickens was his editor-in-chief and his friend .

		But the great novelist soon saw that he was not meant for daily journalism , and , while retaining a financial interest in the paper , retired .

		But Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	remained at his post until his own death .

		Though not a uni - versity man , he was more scholarly than many a don .

		He was especially versed in the Latin classics .

		Virgil was his favorite author , and he knew by heart whole passages of the chief Latin writers .

		In his closing years , when I first made his acquaintance , he had the pecu - liar habit of borrowing school books on Latin , which he would examine with intense interest in order to see if he could discover any new rules of grammar or construction .

		As a young man he had also read deeply of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` I have seen tears fill his eyes , '' his son
Robert	PERSON	, also a journalist of ability , once said to me , '' on reading passages of Shakes - peare , so keenly did he feel their beauties . ' '

		It was with such a husband by her side that
Emily Crawford	PERSON	finished her newspaper schooling , and she so well learned the lessons that the venerable teacher was , as so often happens , little by little thrown into the shade by the bright pupil .

		`` This my mother al - ways thought unfair , ' ' her son has said to me since her death , '' for she would say , ' I owed so much to his guidance , as his literary taste was unerring and his erudition very great . '

		But I never detected in him a spark of literary jealousy of his wife , while she on her side valued his style , which was pure and crystal - line , scholarly , and free from all ` journalistic humbug , ' as somebody has said .

		` It is too good for cheap daily papers , ' my mother used to say . ' '

		And when Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	died , early in the eighties , Mrs.
Crawford	PERSON	succeeded him and represented in
Paris	LOCATION	`` The Daily News '' until only about ten years ago .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 265 It was no easy task for a man to hold his own in the
Paris	LOCATION	group of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American journalists of those days ; and for a woman to do so , with , in addition , three young children to care for , was still more remarkable .

		For at that period
Laurence Oliphant	PERSON	and de
Blo	PERSON	- witz stood for `` The Times , '' Eichard White - ing for the
New York	LOCATION	`` World , '' Theodore Child was on the staff of `` The Daily
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- graph , ' '
William Henry Huntington	PERSON	was here for the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' which , by the way , Mrs.
Crawford	PERSON	represented later ; while
Hely Bowes	PERSON	was the news-gatherer of the old
London	LOCATION	`` Standard '' when it was a famous Conservative organ ,
Clifford Millage	PERSON	of `` The Daily Chronicle ' ' ;
Emily Blackwell	PERSON	of the famous Anglo-American family she was the sister-in-law of
Lucy Stone	ORGANIZATION	and the Rev. An - toinette
Brown Blackwell	PERSON	, and the sister of Dr.
Elizabeth Blackwell	PERSON	, and , I may add in passing , the first professor in journalism of
Emily Crawford	PERSON	before her marriage , fol - lowed by
Edward King	PERSON	, the correspondent of ' ' The Evening Post ' ' ; and last but not least , Dr.
John Chapman	PERSON	, editor of `` The West - minster Review , '' who then made
Paris	LOCATION	his home and who used to enliven our weekly correspondents ' dinners held in the old Hotel
Brighton	LOCATION	under the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli -LRB- these gatherings were planned and conducted by Whiteing -RRB- with anecdotes of Mill ,
George Eliot	PERSON	, '
Louis Blanc	PERSON	,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, and a host of other celebrities whom he knew during the
London	LOCATION	period of his checkered career .

		Such were the chief figures I may have overlooked some of the English and American fourth estate at the French capital about the time when
Emily Crawford	PERSON	took over the respon - sible duties of representing here a great Lon - don daily .

		In these same days
Francis Charmes	PERSON	was making his first efforts in Parisian journalism in the columns of the venerable `` Journal des Debats , ' ' which had not then been ousted from its leadership among the afternoon papers by the `` Temps . ''

		But it was when he became editor of the ' ' Revue des Deux Mondes ' ' that
M. Charmes	PERSON	attained his highest honors in the public press , for his work on this ponderous I use the word in its earlier sense periodical was largely of a journalistic nature , as he always closed each number with a chronique , a review of the fortnight 's events in the French and foreign world of politics and diplomacy .

		And here one saw that
Francis Charmes	PERSON	was indeed a journalist .

		When the day came round to give the printers the manuscript of this chronique , he would arrive rather earlier than usual at the office of the `` Revue '' in the Rue de TUniversite , close his door to all visi - tors , and , not once leaving his desk , slowly but without a stop fill sheet after sheet of what was really the leader of that number of the periodical ; and when the lunch hour came , the copy was ready for the composing-room .

		Though , at the end , he reviewed what he had written , so clearly was the whole article fixed in his mind before he took up pen that the changes made were as slight as they were few .

		In fact , it was materially almost impossible to make any , for never have I seen such fine writing and the lines so close together as in the manuscript of
Francis Charmes	PERSON	's chron - ique .

		It is really a literary curiosity , so curious in fact that I once asked him to give me one of these manuscripts when it came back from the printers .

		It is written on let - ter-size paper , ninety lines to the page and some fourteen words to the line , so that each written page contains about 1,200 words the equivalent of about three printed pages of the `` Revue . ''

		The chirography is clear , otherwise no printer would be able to decipher it without a magnifying glass ; and even as it | is , the strain on the eye is very severe .

		A further oddity in this connection is that in his ordinary correspondence M. Charmes 's hand -
1	DATE	writing was like that of everybody as regards the size of the letters .

		I once asked him why he wrote his press articles in this peculiar fashion , and his answer , which was not ex - plicative , was , `` Oh , it is a habit . ''

		The internal affairs of the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' have always been wrapped in con - siderable mystery .

		However , the capital of the periodical consists of eighty-three shares of 5,000 francs each , more than a third of which is owned by the
Buloz	PERSON	family .

		Their value is far greater than the invested capital ; and at times , but this is not the case to-day , they have paid a dividend greater than this capital .

		The decline in the value of the shares is due to several causes , the first being the mismanagement of
Charles Buloz	PERSON	, the son and successor , until
1893	DATE	, in the editorship of the founder ,
Francois Buloz	PERSON	; and the second being the general tendencj * in
France	LOCATION	today away from review reading .

		But the broader and more modern views of
Francis Charmes	PERSON	were doing much to revive the material prosperity of the periodical . ''

		I am trying to get it back where it once was , ' ' he said to me one day .

		Another important factor in the manage - ment of the `` Revue '' is the
Committee of Surveillance	ORGANIZATION	, which represents the share - holders , and is composed of
M. Paul Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	LOCATION	, the celebrated political economist and member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, chairman ;
Comte d'Haussonville	ORGANIZATION	, of the French Acad - 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	-LRB- emy , vice chairman ; Mme. Bourget-Pailleron , who , I may say , is not related to
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, but is the daughter of the author of `` Le Monde ou Ton s ` ennuie '' and the grand - daughter of Frangois Buloz ;
Vicomte d'Avenel	ORGANIZATION	, who has travelled in the
United States	LOCATION	and whose first wife , an American , was burnt to death in the disaster of the Bazar de la Charite ; and
M. Aubry-Vitet	PERSON	, whose family and he himself have long been con - nected with the ' ' Revue ' ' as shareholders and contributors , a staunch monarchist , whose daughter is married to
Comte de Rohan	ORGANIZATION	-
Chabot	PERSON	.

		Last month this board voted four to two in favor of
M. Rene Doumic	PERSON	, of the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, as
M. Charmes	PERSON	's successor , and at the beginning of the present month this nomi - nation was confirmed at a general meeting of the share-holders .

		M. Doumic has been the regular literary or dramatic critic of the `` Revue '' since
1893	DATE	, and has had large ex - perience in editorship .

		He has travelled in the
United States	LOCATION	, and was the first of those French professors who now lecture so fre - quently before our universities .

		It is highly probable that
M. Doumic	PERSON	will invite
M. Charles Benoist	PERSON	, conservative deputy and member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, to continue as chroniqueur .

		He used to take
M. Charmes	PERSON	's place when , at very rare intervals , the latter was prevented from furnishing his article , and he has been performing this duty during the present interregnum , while
M. Joseph Bertrand	PERSON	, secretary general , has been acting editor .

		And the doyen of the staff , who has served under every editor , gave me the other day the following interesting souvenir of the founder : '' I knew personally and fully appreciated the admirable qualities of
Frangois Buloz	PERSON	, who brought to the support of his new venture the elite of talents then rife in
France	LOCATION	, which he managed with tact and cleverness .

		I saw at work the intelligence , taste , initiative , and energy of the man who was thoroughly imbued with the grandeur of his enterprise , whose life was a continual labor and a perpetual combat ; who was one of those wrestlers , born to be the founder of something , who united in himself the most diverse faculties , a strong will , a good judgment , and a passionate and indefatigable attention to details .

		Such was
Francois Buloz	PERSON	, the creator of this periodical , which has had many imitators but no equal , whose fortunes were linked with the movements of the
last century	DATE	, a sort of State Institution , as Gam - betta said , an accredited organ of high intellectual culture , bearing to every corner of the world the language and the ideas of
France	LOCATION	.

		Though not himself a writer or a politician , not even an academician , the distinction of his life was to have created one of the most influential and active centres of politics and letters . ''

		And now , in closing , a final word about th < third of my trio of dead journalists ,
Rober Mitchell	PERSON	.

		I knew him very slightly , for hii Bonapartist proclivities and his implacabL opposition to the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	, both as edi tor and deputy , naturally did not tend t -LRB- awaken the sympathy of an American .

		Bu all his friends and fellow-workers dwell or the kindliness of his disposition , which seem ; to have been the most prominent feature o : his character .

		That veteran of the Parii press ,
M. Gaston Jollivet	PERSON	, confirms in a not < to me this statement ; and
M. Arthur Meyer	PERSON	editor-in-chief of the `` Gaulois , '' wher <
Mitchell	PERSON	was the principal leader-writer fo -RSB- so many years under the signature of `` L
Desmoulins	PERSON	, ' ' writes me apropos of his death ' ' In him I lose more than a contributor ; it ii a comrade of all our staff who has passec away , the oldest member of the ` Gaulois ' cir cle .

		He was so affable and agreeable , so easily approached by all ; and he possessed the gif of knowing how to make himself liked . ' '

		Anc in a subsequent note ,
M. Meyer	PERSON	adds : `` Ai regards the French language , you know wha a master he was of it .

		French and gooc French he used both with his pen and in th < rostrum . ' '

Paris	LOCATION	,
Feb. 25 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE REWARDS OF BOOK-REVIEWING not , maintain the publishers , include any pecuniary profit from the sale of the boob reviewed .

		On this vexed question some con trasting utterances , editorial and from corre spondents , have lately appeared in ' ' The Pub lishers ' Weekly , '' a periodical that naturally sides with the manufacturers of books ir condemning their sale on the part of review ers , while from the latter 's point of view sucl sale is not infrequently defended as a legiti mate transaction in an affair that is primarily commercial to all the parties concerned .

		Here as in most disputes , neither side is wholly right or wholly wrong , and a reasonable con cession from each ought to bring about i modus vivendi .

		Neither offensive action or the one side , in the way of stamping title pages or otherwise rendering review copies unsalable -LRB- and perhaps also unpresentable -RRB- nor excessive greed of gain on the other if commendable .

		Perhaps the course adopted ir this matter by a certain reviewer intimately known to the present writer may be of interesl if not also usefully suggestive in this con nection .

		Hundreds of books have passed
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 267 through his hands for review , and for some time he was scrupulously careful not to offer any of these for sale , contenting himself with averting the threatened congestion of his bookshelves by giving away the best and most acceptable and making such room as he could for the others .

		But in course of time the accumulation began to assume formidable pro- portions , and a change of policy became neces - sary .

		Therefore he adopted the practice of making his friends the recipients of as many books as he well could without annoying them , of giving to the local public library a good many of the remainder , with the suggestion that they be placed either on the shelves or in the furnace or on the dump-heap , as might best conduce to the public good , and of offer - ing for sale what were left .

		These were many , it is true , but he fixed a price that should not bring about any suicidal cutting of rates in the book-market , and if the dealer to whom he offered the lot refused to pay this price in any instance , the book was retained .

		If , as the publishers aver , the sale of a review copy at a reduced price tends to lower the market value of the work , its free gift ought to have a still more disastrous effect .

		Who knows how many sales were prevented by this reviewer 's giving away so many of his books to friends and to the local library ?

		But it would have been unreasonable to expect him to cumber his modest quarters with hundreds of volumes of no surpassing worth , and he could not bring himself to destroy them .

		If his action in sell - ing a part of his accumulated stock lost a few dollars to the publishers , may not those dollars have been more needed by the reviewer ?

		If publishers have rights , so possibly have re - viewers .

		Their work in passing judgment upon and giving publicity to the products of the press is not richly rewarded .

		Not uncom - monly it is its own reward -LRB- with the books themselves that have been reviewed -RRB- , and not even the satisfaction of having promoted the circulation of a good book or retarded that of a bad one will go far as a substitute for food and raiment and shelter .

		When publishers issue books out of pure philanthropy , review - ers will review them in the same self-denying spirit ... THE QUEEN-POET OP ROUMANIA .

		known in literature as
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	, a pen-name tes - tifying to her love of song and of forests , died on the second of this month in her seventy - third year .


Pauline Elizabeth Ottilie Louise	PERSON	, as she was christened , with royal profusion of sounding names , was the daughter of
Prince Hermann of Wied	ORGANIZATION	and
Princess Maria of Nassau	ORGANIZATION	.

		A simple and wholesome early life seems to have been hers in the modest prin - cipality to which her later fondest memories always reverted ; and she had no desire to change her lot by marriage unless , as she fancifully added , she could be Queen of Rou - mania .

		As there was no such kingdom then on the map her declaration was equivalent to a vow never to marry .

		But Prince
Charles of Roumania	PERSON	persuaded her in
1869	DATE	to become his bride , and twelve years later
Roumania	PERSON	was made a kingdom and
Elizabeth	PERSON	was crowned queen .

		In her new life she had shown herself a loyal Roumanian , learning the language of the country and spending herself and her private means in good works for its benefit .

		In
1882	DATE	she was elected a member of the
Academy of Sciences of Buch	ORGANIZATION	- arest , and soon afterward became known be - yond the borders of her adopted land as a writer of poems , fairy tales , novelettes , and plays .

		Among her more important works are `` Thoughts of a Queen , '' ``
Edleen Vaughan	PERSON	, '' `` Shadows on Life 's Dial , '' `` A Real Queen 's Fairy Book , ' ' and ' ' From Memory 's Shrine , ' ' the last-named being an informal and frag - mentary autobiography , published five years ago .

		Her first and most fondly cherished pos - session in the way of a novel , as she tells us in that book , was `` The Wide , Wide World '' `` the only book in the least resembling a novel which I was allowed to read while in my teens .

		I was so fond of it that I used to hide it tinder a chair whence I could fetch it out and devour a few pages , in the hours when I ought , perhaps , to have been commit - ting lines of Horace or
Ovid	LOCATION	to memory , or writing an essay on some period of Church history . ''

		Heartbreaking sorrows in plenty came to her in the course of her earlier and later life , and these it may well have been that taught her to speak the language of the heart in poems and tales that have appealed to a wide circle of readers .

		HUMOR 'S PLACE IK POETRY has not been rec - ognized by all poets .

		While Chaucer , Shakes - peare ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, with many others dear to us , have in varying degrees indulged in playful humor in their verse , an almost equally impressive list of poets in our language includes no name associated with this legitimate and , in its proper place , pleasing element of poetry .

		The lofty
Milton	PERSON	one never expects to see descend -LRB- if it be a descent -RRB- to anything approaching playfulness , though his two pieces of verse on
Hobson	PERSON	-LRB- the original of ``
Hobson	PERSON	's choice '' -RRB- , the university carrier , do exhibit a certain gentle humor of their own .

		In the serious
Wordsworth	PERSON	we find an occasional uninten - tional touch of the comic , notablv in `` Peter 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16 Bell	DATE	' ' ; but beyond this ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	is em - phatically not a humorist .

		Neither
Shelley	PERSON	nor
Keats	PERSON	, neither
Rossetti	PERSON	nor
William Mor	PERSON	- ris , neither
Longfellow	PERSON	nor
Bryant	PERSON	, was a humorist in verse .

		On this head the late
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	had something inter - esting to say in his obituary sketch of
Morris	PERSON	, now included in a volume reviewed elsewhere in this issue .

		He writes : `` It was this bois - terous energy and infinite enjoyment of life which made it so difficult for people on meet - ing him for the first time to associate him with the sweet sadness of ` The Earthly Para - dise . '

		How could a man of such exuberant spirits as
Morris	PERSON	so hearty , so noisy often , and often so humorous have written those lovely poems , whose only fault was an occa - sional languor and a lack of humour often commented on when the critic compares him with Chaucer ?

		This subject of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's humour and
Morris	PERSON	's lack of it demands , however , a special word even in so brief a notice as this .

		No man of our time not even
Rossetti	PERSON	had a finer appreciation of humour than
Morris	PERSON	, as is well known to those who heard him read aloud the famous `
Rainbow Scene	ORGANIZATION	' in `
Silas Marner	PERSON	' and certain passages in
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's novels .

		These readings were as fine as
Rossetti	PERSON	's recitations of `
Jim Bludso	PERSON	' and other specimens of Yankee humour .

		And yet it is a common remark , and one that can not be gainsaid , that there is no spark of humour in the published poems of either of these two friends .

		Did it never occur to any critic to ask whether the anomaly was not explicable by some theory of poetic art that they held in common ?

		It is no dis - paragement to say of
Morris	PERSON	that when he began to write poetry the influence of Ros - setti 's canons of criticism upon him was enor - mous , notwithstanding the influence upon him of
Browning	PERSON	's dramatic methods .

		But while
Rossetti	PERSON	's admiration of
Browning	PERSON	was very strong , it was a canon of his criticism that humour was , if not out of place in poetry , a disturbing element of it . ' '

		EARLY LITERARY LIKINGS OF
HENRY JAMES	PERSON	are entertainingly described by him in his story of his boyhood , `` A Small Boy and Others , ' ' and they naturally have for us now , just after his death , an especial interest .

		Per - haps we are tempted to read into them a sig - nificance that they do not hold .

		He says in his seventh chapter : `` An absorbed perusal of The Lamplighter was what I was to achieve at the fleeting hour I continue to circle round ; that romance was on every one 's lips , and I recollect it as more or less thrust upon me in amends for the imposed sacrifice of a ranker actuality that of the improper Mr.
Robin	PERSON	- son , I mean , as to whom there revives in me the main question of where his impropriety , in so general a platitude of the bourgeois , could possibly have dwelt .

		It was to be true indeed that Walt Whitman achieved an im - propriety of the first magnitude ; that success , however , but showed us the platitude return - ing in a genial rage upon itself and getting out of control by generic excess .

		There was no rage at any rate in The Lamplighter , over which I fondly hung and which would have been my first ' grown-up ' novel it had been soothingly offered me for that had I con - sented to take it as really and truly grown-up .

		I could n't have said what it lacked for the I character , I only had my secret reserves , and !

		when one blest afternoon on the
New Brigh	LOCATION	- | ton boat I waded into The Initials I saw how right I had been .

		The Initials was grown-up and the difference thereby exquisite ... '' More in the same vein , but too artistically elaborated -LRB- in the finest James manner -RRB- for reproduction here , awaits the reader who will turn back to that very characteristic volume of just three years ago this month .

		Not only the intoxicating delights of one 's first grown - up novel , but other bookish pleasures of child - hood are there depicted .

		If the picture is by no means such as the child himself could have drawn or even remotely imagined , it is none the less interesting , and probably much more so .

		... THE MUCH-EDITED
HORACE	PERSON	-LRB- also much translated and imitated , annotated and biog - raphized -RRB- has more editions to his credit than all but a few of the world 's great writers .

		In fact , the editions are so many that Horatian scholars seem timid about venturing an esti - mate of their number .

		Of manuscript copies alone , complete or partial , there are about 250 , though none of these is of earlier date than the ninth century of our era .

		From the editio princeps of
1470	DATE	to the latest school edition is a period of nearly four and one-half centuries , in which great classical scholars like
Lam	PERSON	- binus , Cruquius ,
Heinsius	LOCATION	,
Bentley	LOCATION	,
Kiessling	PERSON	,
Miiller	PERSON	,
Wickham	PERSON	, and
Schiitz	PERSON	have lavished their learning and ` their critical acumen on the poet 's works and given to the world valu - able editions of those works .

		Translators into English , from Sir
Philip Francis	PERSON	and Lord
Ravensworth	PERSON	and Sir
Theodore Martin	PERSON	, to
John Conington	PERSON	,
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	,
Sargent	LOCATION	, and
Bennett	PERSON	, have been innumerable and often ad - mirably skilful , though the Horatian special - ist dismisses them all as falling far below the original in their attempts to translate the untranslatable .

		Within the
last few * days 1916	DATE	-RSB- 269 there has come word from the Widener Li - brary at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	that a notable Horatian col - lection , one hundred and five volumes in all , has been received from the estate of the late
William C. Williamson	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	' 52 , and is soon to be placed on exhibition .

		Many valu - able editions of the poet are in this collection , notably an Aldine of
1501	DATE	and an Elzevir of
1676	DATE	.

		Bequests of this sort to college libraries are both of interest to the library world and are likely to have an effect , however small , in strengthening the resistance against the grow - ing tendency to abolish all classical studies .

		THE THREATENED PAPEB FAMINE IN ENG - LAND , by reason of the proposed prohibition on imports of certain bulky and not immedi - ately indispensable goods , such as wood-pulp , paper , and all paper-making material , natur - ally causes apprehension among printers and publishers in that country , and strong protest from the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	and the
Master Printers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	is to go , or already has gone , to the President of the
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	.

		Increased cost of pro- duction in every department of publishing has been one of the inevitable results of the war , and even with the importation of paper unrestricted by government action the price of that commodity has prac - tically doubled ; `` and what it will reach if the worst comes to the worst , '' says the '' `` Times '' in a tone of gloomy foreboding , `` it is impossible to say . ''

		After predicting the effect on general publishing it further remarks : `` The crisis is more serious still where educational books are concerned .

		It will be a strange commentary on our war against German Kultur if we adopt as one of our weapons a prohibitive price on the educa - tional apparatus of our own rising genera - tion . ''

		American importations of books may be seriously affected .

		The same editorial writer continues : `` Unless the proposals be modified many new books prepared for the
spring	DATE	are likely to be postponed , even by those publishers who ordered their paper in time . ''

		Thus it is that on every side and in every relation we are confronted by some baleful aspect of what threatens to become in literal truth a world-consuming conflagration .

		THE NOVELIST 'S PRIME OP LIFE , according to
Lockhart	PERSON	in his sketch of Cervantes , is not an early prime .


Lockhart	PERSON	's own words are : `` I shall conclude what I have to say of the author of
Don Quixote	PERSON	with one remark namely , that
Cervantes	PERSON	was an old man when he wrote his masterpiece of comic romance ; that nobody has ever written successful novels , when young , but
Smollett	PERSON	; and that Hum - phrey Clinker , written in the last year of
Smollett	ORGANIZATION	's life , is , in every particular of con - ception , execution , and purpose , as much superior to
Roderick Random	PERSON	as
Don Quixote	PERSON	is to the Galatea . ''

		Cervantes was probably fifty-seven or fifty-eight when the first part of his great work appeared , and ten years elapsed before it was followed by a second part , which some critics rate higher than the earlier portion .

		But both
Cervantes	PERSON	and
Lockhart	PERSON	lived before
Oslerism	PERSON	had wrought | a change of mind on the subject of man 's prime .

		At any rate , there have been many modern examples of good work in literature , including fiction , in the first flush of man - hood or womanhood .

		An editorial in the 1 ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' voices the sur - prise with which `` some of us '' learned that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	had but recently crossed the half - century line , his stories having been read and enjoyed from a time so seemingly remote | in the past as to have produced a vague general impression of his comparative senility .

		The truth is , man 's productive years seem , i with the advance of medical science , of sani - ; tation , of domestic and public hygiene , and of a dawning perception of the significance of eugenics , to have been extended at both ends , certainly at the latter end ; and good work in fiction , as in some other branches of litera - ture , may be looked for in the entire half century or more from the writer 's legal ma - I jority onward .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is still produc - ing excellent fiction at seventy-nine , and Mr. i Kipling wrote some of his most striking tales | in his early twenties .

		THE ' ' AKABIAN NIGHTS ' ' AND THE ENGLISH NOVEL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The magic of Oriental story has lent charms to poets of English , from the age of Chaucer to our own ago of Kipling .

		Chaucer and
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	borrowed beauty from the wisdom east of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	.

		The drama , the essay , and the novel have known the influence of the mysteri - ous
East	LOCATION	.

		Concerning the special Persian influence upon European literature in general , readers of THE DIAL have recently received a considerable amount of information from the pen of Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		Attention attracted by his article may give value to the following group of notes concerning his subject in one of its phases , the relation between the thousand and one stories of Scheherazade and the rodent-like breed of English novels .

		Among the terror novels of the wild-oats youth of the Romantic Movement , '' The Arabian Nights ' Entertainments '' walked not so heavily as to leave their trail conspicuous ; on the other hand , it is far from invisible . ''

		The History of the Caliph Vathek '' is one unmistakable footprint .


Horace Walpole	PERSON	himself made use of the characters of the frame of the oreatest of story sequences in his '' Hieroglyphic Tales . ''

		Published a year be - fore
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's English edition of '' Vathek , '' Wai - pole 's satirical stories show , rather than the influ - ence of writers of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	tales in English , that of the brilliant Oriental narratives of Count
Anthony Hamilton	PERSON	.


Matthew Gregory Lewis	PERSON	, next in importance to
Walpole	LOCATION	in the history of the terror novel , derived the outline for his obscene triumph , `` Ambrosio , or The Monk , '' from one of
Richard Steele	PERSON	's presentations of '' Turkish Tales '' in '' The Guardian . ''

		And in his series of '' Ro - mantic Tales , ''
Lewis	PERSON	borrowed Count
Anthony Hamilton	PERSON	's '' Four Facardins , '' and made use of characters from the '' Arabian Nights '' for an - other story , `` Amorassan , or The Spirit of the Frozen Ocean . ''


William Godwin	PERSON	, in his '' Lives of the Necromancers , '' mentioned the '' Arabian Nights '' as a source of Oriental enchantments .

		Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	, the last and best of the novelists of terror , was considerably indebted to the '' Arabian Nights '' and to `` Vathek '' ; passages in `` Frankenstein , '' `` The Last Man , '' and ''
Perkin Warbeck	PERSON	'' show her appreciation of the charm of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	story .

		The group of English novels of avowedly East - ern setting has long been a source of interest to joyous readers .

		After the long series of pseudo - Eastern '' moral '' tales , of which Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's '' Rasselas '' and
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	's '' Murad the Unlucky '' are fair examples ,
Thomas Hope	PERSON	's `` Anastasius , or The Memoirs of a Greek '' comes as a delightfully non-moral relief .

		Reminiscent of ''
Gil	PERSON	Bias '' and the Abbe Barthelemi 's ''
Anachar	PERSON	- sis , '' `` Anastasius '' is a long narrative of the wan - derings of an unchivalrous
Don Juan	PERSON	in
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Assyria	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		In
1824	DATE	, only four years after `` Anastasius , '' appeared the first English realistic Oriental tale , '' Haj ji Baba of Ispahan . ''

		Its author ,
James Justinian Morier	PERSON	, had studied
Persia	LOCATION	at close range .

		He knew the actual land of the Shah ; he knew also the '' Arabian Nights , '' as he showed clearly in his later and more roman - tic novels , `` Zohrab , the Hostage '' and `` Ayesha , .

		the Maid of
Kars	LOCATION	. ''

		The greatest novelists of the last century admit - ted their debt to the '' Arabian Nights . ''

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	recorded his boyhood delight in these and other
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	tales ; and he many times drew upon the '' Arabian Nights '' for touches of color with which to adorn his Scotch novels .

		This sentence of tribute appears in the Dedicatory Epistle prefixed to '' Ivanhoe '' : '' No fascination has ever been attached to Oriental literature equal to that produced by
M. Galland	PERSON	's first translation of the Arabian Tales . ''

		M.
Victor Chauvin	PERSON	, in his '' Bibliographic des ouvrages arabes , '' mentions
Charles Dickens	PERSON	and
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	as English novelists who - were influenced by the '' Arabian Nights . ''

		Casual allusions in several of
Dickens	LOCATION	's stories do indicate that he read in childhood and remembered in man - hood two collections of Oriental tales , the '' Ara - bian Nights '' and Dr.
John Ridley	PERSON	's '' Tales of the Genii . ''


Benjamin Disraeli	PERSON	,
Earl of Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	, owed the suggestion for his '' Alroy '' to
Beck	PERSON	- ford 's '' Vathek , '' or perhaps to the unpublished episode of '' Vathek '' called `` Al Roui . ''

		Himself a native of
Bengal	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	was not especially susceptible to Oriental influences ; yet he , too , like
Dickens	PERSON	, read the '' Arabian Nights '' in his boy - hood and , when he came to write stories , sometimes mentioned those persistent
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	tales .

		Char - lotte
Bronte	ORGANIZATION	gives evidence that the '' Arabian Nights '' were a source of pleasure and profit to the unusual little girl who was to write ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' and ''
Shirley	PERSON	. ''


Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, in `` Al - ton Locke , '' pays repeated compliment to Lane 's `` Arabian Nights . ''

		How many novelists of our own day would not , if they thought back to the lazy hours of late childhood , smile an acknowledg - ment of the magic power of '' The Arabian Nights ' Entertainments '' ?

		Soon we shall discover Persian influences in this year 's best sellers , as we have already caught the incense of the '' Arabian Nights '' in the tales of
Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	and that chief of story-tellers ,
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, in your number of
Feb. 17	DATE	, attempts to reply to my letter in the issue of
Jan. 20	DATE	.

		Although he does not hesitate to say that I am not telling the truth , yet he does not indi - cate where I am at fault , and I have no hesitation in adhering to my previous statements .

		The learned doctor 's attitude reminds me of dear old Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, who used to get quite angry when he saw nail after nail of modern reasoning and research driven into the coffin of the man of
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	gives his case away when he admits that the body of the deposition in the BeHott-Mountjoy lawsuit and the signature are in the same handwriting .

		The body of the deposition is always written by the law clerk , whereas the signature is written by the deponent , if he is able to write .

		In this case the signature is written by the law clerk , and the mark -LRB- dot or cross is immaterial -RRB- is added by the illiterate deponent Shakspere .

		I am not aware that the actors application for a coat of arms has been regarded by Baconians as evidence that he could not write the plays .

		My opponent gains some satisfaction by erecting an imaginary argument , and proceeding to knock it down .

		However , the fact of the application was a subject of mirth at the time , as is proved by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's play , and that it was regarded as incon - gruous must count for something in the present controversy .

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	appears blind to my point that no amount of contemporary praise of the Shakes - peare plays and poems can be regarded as evi - dence of the authorship .

		If we examine the other contemporary references , it is seen that many persons were in the secret ; for instance , the '' up - start crow beautified with our feathers '' indicates the paltry actor strutting about decked out as a dramatic author ; and
Thomas Nash	PERSON	's statement that some '' leave the trade of noverint whereto they were born '' to write plays , is a hit at
Bacon	LOCATION	, a lawyer -LRB- '' noverint '' meaning lawyer -RRB- and the son of a lawyer , turning playwright .

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	places absolute confidence in the commonly accepted meaning of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's verses .

		When two clever men like
Bacon	PERSON	and
Jonson	PERSON	were composing the ''
Leonard Digges	PERSON	'' and other verses for the folio and the
Stratford	LOCATION	monument , to put the public on a wrong scent , it is not at all likely that the truth should be patent to the man in the street ; but Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	may console himself with the knowledge that he errs in a goodly company , including quite possibly some of the actor 's contemporaries .

		The theory that the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	, is dismissed by Dr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum with a sneer .

		A genuine literary student would be interested to know what
Cicero	PERSON	and other contemporary writers tell us of the subject .

		The
Stratford	LOCATION	actor 's name '' Shakspere '' has the a short as in ''
Jack	PERSON	, '' and the middle s is part of the first syllable , as may be proved by the alter - native spelling '' Shaxpere . ''

		The name may per - haps be derived from the French ''
Jacques Pierre	PERSON	. ''

		The author 's pseudonym has the a long as in '' take , '' and the middle s is part of the second syllable , as is proved by the alternative '' Shake - speare . ''

		The obvious derivation is supported by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's authority , brandishing a spear at ignorance .

		FURTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF '' UNTENTED . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am not a Shakespeare scholar , and the sug - gestion I make may be very naive .

		It would seem to present itself at the outset of any inquiry , and has probably been duly considered .

		It is simply that '' untented '' is a misprint for '' untended . ''

		The passage from '' King Lear '' quoted by Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	in your issue of
Jan. 20	DATE	reads : '' The un ten ted woundings of a father 's curse pierce every sense about thee . ''

		What is meant by '' woundings '' is any evil resulting from a father 's curse , disease , injury , misfortune of any kind .

		What
Lear	PERSON	wishes is that in her sufferings , mental and physical , she shall find no aid , medical or otherwise , and no sympathy .

		I do not believe that
Lear	PERSON	, in the tumult of his passion , would have thought of the niceties of medical practice .

		I think the critics are prone to find deep or recondite meanings when Shakes - peare 's thought was in reality very simple and natural .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been much interested in the communica - tions explaining the word '' tent '' as used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and others , and have wondered that no one has given the meaning of the word as used in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	and also in
Cheshire	LOCATION	.

		I recall its use many times in my childhood , and always with the same meaning , that is , '' hinder '' or '' prevent '' : '' I will tent thee doing it , '' '' He tented me from it , '' etc. , always in the sense of '' hinder . ''

		In
Halliwell	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Provincial and Archaic Words , '' this is the first definition given .

		The word is also used in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	in the sense of '' scare , '' or '' frighten , '' and many times in the sense of `` guard '' ; but the first mentioned use is very common .

		Whether any of these meanings can be applied to the passage from ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' is a matter of opinion .

		I certainly think that '' the unhindered woundings of a fathers curse , '' or '' the unguarded woundings , '' gives as good an interpretation as any yet stated .

		Is it out of possibility to assume that
King Lear	PERSON	meant that nothing could hinder the woundings of his curse from piercing every sense about
Goneril	LOCATION	?

		At least it may interest some to know that the word `` tent '' is still in use in parts of
England	LOCATION	in the same sense as given by
Halliwell	PERSON	.

		272 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	AND HIS CIRCLE .

		* A bore has been wittily defined as a person who wants to talk about himself when you want to talk about yourself .

		The reason why it fell to the lot of the late
Theodore Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	to enjoy so many close and lifelong friendships with the poets and other notable men of his time is , one suspects , very largely because he was so little eager to impress him - self upon them and upon the world as a poet , or as a writer of any sort , and so generously appreciative of others ' achievements in litera - ture .

		With but little of what would be called creative or imaginative work from his own pen , we have in some abundance essays and sketches that have been prompted by the lives and works of others ; and it is with a recent collection of such occasional pieces that the present article will concern itself . ''

		Old Familiar Faces '' contains eight chap - ters of personal reminiscence originally con - tributed to `` The Athenaeum '' and intended by the author for republishing in book-form , though this intention was not carried out in his lifetime .

		An anonymous friend has now done the work for him , and introduced the volume with a pleasing and most welcome , though too short , account of the author , with some equally interesting passages concerning the latter 's thirty years ' house-mate , the poet
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		The eight articles have to do with Borrow ,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, Dr.
Gordon Hake	PERSON	,
Lord de Tabley	ORGANIZATION	,
William Mor	PERSON	- ris , and
Francis Hindes Groome	PERSON	in the order here given .

		Except in the
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Hake	PERSON	chapters , the author shows that he writes with the intimate personal knowledge of old friendship , but in all there is the genial glow of cordial understanding and ap - preciation .

		In Tennyson we are made acquainted with the poet rather than , as would have been peculiarly agreeable and more in harmony with the general tone of the book , the man and friend .

		In Dr.
Hake	PERSON	, a considerably older man than Watts-Dunton , in fact , almost exactly coeval with
Tennyson	PERSON	, we see the friend of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	rather than the friend of the writer .

		A record of friendship , however , the book mainly is , from first to last ; and it strikingly illustrates , among other truths , that though things equal to the same thing are equal to one another , friends of the same man may not be friends of one another .

		The preface calls attention * OLD FAMILIAR FACES .

		By
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		to the cordial relations that existed between Watts-Dunton and so many of his celebrated contemporaries , differing vastly among them - selves in temperament , yet all temperamen - tally congenial to Watts-Dunton ; '' and as they , one by one , passed away , to him was left the sad duty of giving to the world by far the most intimate picture of their various personalities . ''

		The writer thus continues : '' There was obviously some subtle quality in Watts-Dunton 's nature that not only attracted to him great minds in the world of art and letters ; but which seemed to hold captive their affection for a lifetime .

		Even an instinctive recluse such as Borrow , a man almost too sensitive for friend - ship , found in Watts-Dunton one whose capacity for friendship was so great as to override all other considerations .

		Watts-Dunton was ' the friend of friends ' to
Rossetti	PERSON	, who wished to make him his heir , and was dissuaded only when he saw that to do so would pain his friend , who regarded it as an act of injustice to
Rossetti	PERSON	's own family .

		During his lifetime Swinburne desired to make over to him his entire fortune .

		The man to whom these tributes were paid was undoubtedly possessed of some rare and strange gift . ''

		Choosing for quotation a few of the remi - niscent and personal passages in the book rather than any of its literary criticism or purely bookish talk , let us present , first , the author 's graphic description of Borrow in his hale and hearty seventies : `` As a vigorous old man Borrow never had an equal , I think .

		There has been much talk of the vigor of
Shelley	PERSON	's friend ,
E. J. Trelawny	ORGANIZATION	.

		I knew that splendid old corsair , and admired his agility of limb and brain ; but at seventy Borrow could have walked off with
Trelawny	LOCATION	under his arm .

		At seventy years of age , after breakfasting at eight o'clock in
Hereford Square	LOCATION	, he would walk to
Putney	LOCATION	, meet one or more of us at
Roehamp	LOCATION	- ton , roam about Wimbledon and
Richmond Park	LOCATION	with us , bathe in the
Fen Ponds	LOCATION	with a north - east wind cutting across the icy water like a razor , run about the grass afterward like a boy to shake off some of the water-drops , stride about the park for hours , and then , after fasting for twelve hours , eat a dinner at
Roehampton	LOCATION	that would have done Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's eyes good to see .

		Finally , he would walk back to
Hereford Square	ORGANIZATION	, getting home late at night .

		And if the physique of the man was bracing , his conversation , unless he happened to be suffering from one of his occasional fits of depression , was still more so .

		There is a kind of humour the delight of which is that while you smile at the pictures it draws , you smile quite as much or more to think that there is a mind so whimsical , crotchety , and odd as to draw them .

		This was the * humour of Borrow . ''

		These and other pen-strokes depicting the `` Romany Rye '' are , we feel , not only vivid but true to life ; for the writer was conscious of qualities in himself that made it possible to break through the other 's reserve and gain an
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 273 intimate knowledge of him such as probably no one else could claim .

		Few were the friends that Borrow thus took to his heart , but those few realized '' how lovable was his nature , with all its angularities how simple and courageous , how manly and noble . ' '

		In the next portrait sketched by the au - thor 's deft hand occurs the following touch of quiet humor , prompted by the publication of
Rossetti	PERSON	's letters under Dr.
George Birk	PERSON	- beck Hill 's editorship .

		Rossetti 's friend says : '' It is a sweet and comforting thought for every poet that , whether or not the public cares during his life to read his verses , it will after his death care very much to read his letters to his mistress , to his wife , to his relatives , to his friends , to his butcher , and to his baker .

		And some letters are by that same public held to be more precious than others .

		If , for instance it has chanced that during the poet 's life he , like
Rossetti	PERSON	, had to borrow thirty shillings from a friend , that is a circumstance of especial piquancy .

		The public likes or rather it demands to know all about that borrowed cash .

		Hence it behoves the properly equipped editor who understands his duty to see that not one allusion to it in the poet 's correspondence is omitted .

		If he can also show what caused the poet to borrow those thirty shillings if he can by learned annotations show whether the friend in question lent the sum willingly or unwillingly , conveniently or inconveniently if he can show whether the loan was ever repaid , and if repaid when he will be a happy editor indeed .

		Then he will find a large and grateful public to whom the mood in which the poet sat down to write ' The Blessed
Damosel	PERSON	' is of far less interest than the mood in which he borrowed thirty shillings . ''

		One of the too few personally reminiscent touches in the
Tennyson	LOCATION	chapter relates to a conversation with the poet on nightingales , wherein the author claimed an ability to dis - tinguish one nightingale 's note from another 's among a number of his favorites along the banks of the Ouse .

		`` And if this infinite variety of individualism , '' he concludes , `` is thus seen in the lower animals , what must it be in man ? ' '

		Then he continues : '' There is , however , in the entire human race , a fatal instinct for marring itself .

		To break down the exterior signs of this variety of individualism in the race by mutual imitation , by all sorts of affectations , is the object not only of the civiliza - tion of the Western world , but of the very negroes on the
Gaboon River	LOCATION	.

		No wonder , then , that whensoever we meet , as at rarest interval we do meet , an individual who is able to preserve his personality as
Nature	ORGANIZATION	meant it to live , we feel an attraction toward him such as is irresistible .

		Now I would challenge those who knew him to say whether they ever knew any other man so free from this great human infirmity as
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		The way in which his simplicity of nature would manifest itself was , in some instances , most re - markable . ''

		A few pages later there occurs a surprising I because so unexpectedly depreciatory , if not 1 contemptuous , reference to
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		The i writer 's genial manner and charitable judg - ment had not prepared one for the slur he puts upon our best-loved poet .

		After point - ing out the two obvious classes of poetry , the popularly appreciated and the kind that ap - peals to a more cultivated taste , he says that `` of the one perhaps
Byron	PERSON	is the type , the exemplars being such poets as those of the , Mrs.
Hemans	PERSON	school in
England	LOCATION	, and of the !

		Longfellow school in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		To rate Longfellow no higher than `` the Mrs.
Hemans	PERSON	school , '' whatever the undeniable popularity of his `` Psalm of Life '' and other i earlier -LRB- with possibly some later -RRB- poems , does !

		not show the soundest of judgment , and can be excused only on the supposition of unac - quaintance with the poet 's work as a whole .

		As a final extract from this assemblage of familiar portrait studies , let the following on the too early death of
William Morris	PERSON	be given : '' It is difficult not to think that the cause of -RSB- causes of his death was excessive exercise of all his forces , especially of the imaginative faculty .

		When I talked to him , as I often did , of the peril of such a life of tension as his , he pooh-poohed the idea . '

		Look at
Gladstone	LOCATION	, ' he would say ; ! '

		look at those wise owls your chancellors and your judges .

		Do n't they live all the longer for work * It is rust that kills men , not work . '

		No doubt he was right in contending that in intellectual efforts such as those he alluded to , where the only faculty drawn upon is the ` dry light of intelligence , ' a prodigious amount of work may be achieved with - i out any sapping of the sources of life .

		But is this so where that fusion of all the faculties which we call genius is greatly taxed ?

		I doubt it .

		In all j true imaginative production there is , as De Quincey pointed out many years ago , a movement not , of ' the thinking machine ' only , but of the whole man the whole ' genial ' nature of the worker his imagination , his judgment , moving in an evolu - : tion of lightning velocity from the whole of the work to the part , from the part to the whole , together with every emotion of the soul .

		Hence i when , as in the case of
Walter Scott	PERSON	, of
Charles i Dickens	PERSON	, and presumably of Shakespeare too , the emotional nature of man is overtaxed , every part of the frame suffers , and cries out in vain for its share of that nervous fluid which is the true vis I vita . ''

		Portraits of all the leading characters in the book , including the author but excluding Borrow and
Lord de Tabley	ORGANIZATION	, are appropri - ately inserted .

		A
Rossetti	PERSON	likeness of Mrs.
Morris	PERSON	`` the most lovely woman I have ever known , '' declares the author serves for a frontispiece .

March 16	DATE	THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE : LORI > .

		* The manner of the first half of Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	's `` The Art of the Moving Picture '' befits the subject .

		You might expect as much from a literary gent and a movie fan .

		The `` gentle and kindly , '' `` dear and patient '' reader of the benevolent and enthusiastic author 's mingled and kaleidoscopic succession of information , gossip , comment , fancy , criti - cism , exhortation , and prophecy leaves off with his brain as full of confusion , flickering , and fever as it is after the five-reel show , which lasts , according to this book , one hour and forty minutes .

		The manner of the other half befits the age and the optimistic public for which it is written .

		In the second half , Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	, who writes with
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, as a background , `` a photoplay paradise '' where `` the spoken theatre is practically banished '' -LRB- most of us live in paradises of the sort , and the rest are on the way -RRB- in the second half , Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	limits himself mostly to the role of progressivist and prophet .

		Having classified the photoplay into Action Film , Intimate Film , and Splendor Film , further defined as Sculpture-in-motion , Painting-in-motion , and Architecture-in-motion , suggesting respec - tively red -LRB- hot -RRB- , blue -LRB- colder and quieter -RRB- , and yellow -LRB- the hue of pageants and sun - shine not the consecrated yellow of every - day speech -RRB- , he draws aside the curtains of the west and discloses the rainbow-lighted future .

		The reader who came to be informed remains to be inspired .

		For , even now , the art of the moving pic - ture is all but a substitute for the saloon . ''

		The things they drank to see , and saw but grotesquely , and paid for terribly , now roll before them with no after pain or punish - ment . ''

		This seems to mean that the moving picture is a cheap and convenient substitute for delirium tremens .

		It sounds plausible .

		But that is n't all .

		The moving picture is going to be a substitute for , or at least a vari - ant upon , all sorts of long-winded and obscure text and reference books .

		Along with other changes , `` there will be available at certain centres collections of films equivalent to the
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	and the Encyclopedia Britannica . ''

		Still further , the moving pic - ture is suggested as a new medium for '' the new sect of poets , called the Imagists , '' of whom '' all the world is talking . '' ''

		The Imagist photoplay will put discipline into the inner ranks of the enlightened and remind the sculptors , painters , and architects of the * THE ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE .

		movies that there is a continence even beyond sculpture and that seas of realism may not have the power of a little well-considered elimination . ''

		The Church also , in her own way , will `` avail herself of the motion pic - ture , wholeheartedly , as in mediaeval time she took over the marvel of Italian painting . ' '

		But all this is as nothing in comparison with what follows : '' The scientific museums distribute routine pamphlets that would set the whole world right on certain points if they were but read by said world .

		Let them be filmed and started .

		Whatever the congressman is permitted to frank to his con - stituency , let him send in the motion picture form when it is the expedient and expressive way . ''

		When men work for the high degrees in the universities , they labor on a piece of literary con - spiracy called a thesis which no one outside of the university hears of again .

		The gist of the research work that is dead to the democracy , through the university merits of thoroughness , moderation of statement , and final touch of discovery , would have a chance to live and grip the people in a motion picture transcript , if not a photoplay .

		It would be
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	.

		The relentless fire of criticism which the heads of the depart - ments would pour on the production before they allowed it to pass would result in a standardiza - tion of the sense of scientific fact over the land .

		Suppose the film has the coat of arms of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	along with the name of the young graduate whose thesis it is .

		He would have a chance to reflect credit on the university even as much as a football player . ''

		Surely , after this there is no further need of justification for ' ' the fourth largest indus - try in the
United States	LOCATION	, attended daily by ten million people , and in ten days by a hun - dred million , capable of interpreting the larg - est conceivable ideas that come within the range of the plastic arts . ' '

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's enthusiasm grows greater with each successive demonstration of the splendiferous effect of the moving picture upon future civilization .

		By the time his space runs out , he is able clearly to descry in the before-mentioned rainbow-lighted vistas The Acceptable Year of the Lord .

		He thus entitles his concluding chapter , which reaches its climax in this exalted strain : '' Scenario writers , producers , photoplay actors , endowers of exquisite films , sects using special motion pictures for a predetermined end , all you who are taking the work as a sacred trust , I bid you God-speed .

		Let us resolve that whatever
America	LOCATION	's to-morrow may be , she shall have a day that is beautiful and not crass , spiritual , not ma - terial .

		Let us resolve that she shall dream dreams deeper than the sea and higher than the clouds of heaven , that she shall come forth crowned and transfigured with her statesmen and wizards and saints and sages about her , with magic behind her and miracle before her .

		Pray that the workers in this your glorious new art be delivered from the mere lust of the flesh and the pride of life .

		Let your spirits outflame your burning bodies . ''

		Consider what it will do to your souls , if you are true to your trust .

		Every year , despite earthly sorrow and the punishment of your mortal sins , despite all weakness and all of
Time	ORGANIZATION	's re - venges upon you , despite Nature 's reproofs and the whips of the angels , new visions will come , new prophecies will come .

		You will be seasoned spirits in the eyes of the wise .

		The record of your ripeness will be found in your craftsman - ship .

		You will be God 's thoroughbreds . ''

		It has come then , this new weapon of men , and the face of the whole earth changes .

		In after centuries its beginning will be indeed remembered . ''

		It has come , this new weapon of men , and by faith and a study of the signs we proclaim that it will go on and on in immemorial wonder . ''

		We have felt all the time that the Accept - able Year would come some time , and soon .

		There have been so many prophets , and so many inventions of the means of grace .

		But we never looked for it in this way .

		We always thought it would come by way of Efficiency , or Legislative Enactment -LRB- Progressive , of course -RRB- , or the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Idea , or some move - ment like the Civic Centre , or possibly postum or peanut-butter or pedagogy , or some other such complex thing .

		* THE MODERN STUDY OF LITERATURE .

		An Introduction to
Literary Theory and Interpretation	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Richard Green Moul	PERSON	- ton .

		Chicago :
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has triumphantly arranged his many varied trophies with careful design in a vast hall , which he calls '' The Modern Study of Literature . ''

		To one without at least speaking acquain - tance with Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's previous work , the inelusiveness of this book is almost stag - gering .

		But the author explains at the out - set that this is the synthesis of at least six different volumes , representing the thought of more than forty years .

		And when one compares the present book with these former ones , he observes how the author has merely condensed , rearranged , expanded his source , in this case himself .

		Morphology , evolution of the various types , literary criticism , litera - ture as philosophy and art , all these are treated from the standpoint of world litera - ture and its place in our culture .

		All in all , the result is a most impressive guide to the study of literature .

		Fortunately , a book is not like the prover - bial chain , it may be far stronger than its weakest part .

		Otherwise , many thoughtful readers would not give Professor
Moulton	PERSON	due credit for his achievement as a whole .

		In this case , the weakest part is his championing of inductive criticism .

		As far back as
1885	DATE	, in his '' Shakspere as a Dramatic Artist / ' he launched this theory ; and in
1889	DATE	, Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	, in his `` Essays toward a Critical Method , '' quite demolished it .

		But Professor
Moulton	PERSON	stands by his guns with real heroism .

		Through almost a quarter of the whole vol - ume , he hurls the same bombs at us , while they explode nothing but themselves .

		It is , nevertheless , important to see how they have cleared the air . ''

		The paradoxes of criticism have , '' he says , '' come to be enrolled among the curiosities of literature . ''

		The `` law underlying fluctua - tions of literary judgements .

		.

		is the continu - ous triumph of creative literature over the criticism that has opposed it .

		Traditional criticism is a thing of confusion because its foundation has been built upon the sand . ''

		Judgment is prejudice , that is , in the terms of
Hogarth	LOCATION	, everyone is a judge of painting except the connoisseur .

		Therefore Professor
Moulton	PERSON	concludes `` that art is made legiti - mate by refusing to obey laws . ''

		A '' fault '' is merely a '' unique effect . ''

		Therefore '' the result '' of applying standards to art `` has been a critical chaos . ''

		There is something sadly familiar about all this , particularly in our own time : but it does not generally come from persons of Pro- fessor
Moulton	PERSON	's learning and intellectual power .

		The obvious difficulty with such a position is that it does not recognize either 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	the facts of literary history or the constitu - j tion of the human mind . ''

		The history of judicial criticism '' is far more than '' the con - tinuous triumph of authors over critics '' : it is just as much the advance of critics over critics .

		Moreover , his contention that ''
Shak	PERSON	- spere criticism has been a series of retreating attacks '' is an astonishing contradiction of the facts ; and by implication he elevates stray derogatory remarks about Spenser and
Milton	PERSON	into wholly false importance .

		But more fundamental and unescapable are the facts of human nature and the mediums of human expression .

		In his defence of Shake - speare ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	, in his very attack on judicial criticism , he is uttering judg - ments himself in a perfectly regular and inevitable way .

		In trying to escape from judi - cial criticism his only way is by using judi - cial criticism .

		Thus the despised instrument says to him , `` When me you fly , I am the wings . ''

		In such a predicament , Professor
Moulton	PERSON	has good reason to say , `` the idea of measuring still clings to us '' !

		But how shall we answer his contention that '' in no field of thought can be found any considerable body of discussion which pre - sents such a mass of inconsistencies , contra - dictory positions , advancing and retreating argument , as in the history of literary criti - cism since the Kenaissance '' ?

		The obvious answer comes to us from the defenders of philosophy : truth and standards of judg - ment can be reached only by the conflict of opposing opinions through the centuries .

		But the simple and final answer to Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's whole attack is the constitution of human nature which makes judgment of val - ues instinctive , involuntary , inevitable .

		Our author , on the contrary , explains that `` the popular craving for judgement rests partly on this fallacy of values , and in part is the product of our history in which accident -LSB- italics ours -RSB- at one time made classical art a fixed standard by which everything else could be measured . '' ''

		This fallacy of values '' Professor
Moulton	PERSON	can not endure .

		For relief he turns joyfully to what he calls inductive , or interpretive , criticism .

		Here at least is the grand refuge from the shifting sands of judgment ; here is the pure light of scientific observation , dis - pelling the darkness of chaotic valuations . ''

		Inductive criticism has in its favor .

		.

		the fact that inductive science is drawing all fields of thought to itself . ''

		Such a method merely discerns and notes distinctions , but does not assay them .

		As he says in the widely used
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	pamphlet entitled `` Literary Criticism and Theory of Interpretation , '' `` the whole conception of ` merit , ' ` value , ' ` higher and lower , ' is inher - ently judicial and outside science such comparisons of merit tend to paralyze lit - erary conception . ''

		Valuing , it seems , must be thrown out because it takes place in a falli - ble human mind .

		But how about the substi - tute , so-called interpretation ?

		Is this not also the product of a fallible human mind , and therefore subject also to error ?

		To take a perfectly typical example , is Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's division of the book of `` Ecclesi - astes '' into five essays , prologue , epilogue , etc. , valid as a botanical classification is valid ?

		This particular division of his is plausible and , as we happen to believe , admirable ; but we have a right to cast the same book into quite different literary form . ''

		Interpreta - tion '' does not , then , remove the probability of `` personal error . ''

		Now our author has unquestionably ren - dered great service by emphasizing the necessity of our approaching a piece of litera - ture with minds as free as possible from prejudice .

		He insists that we should study this work of art to find out all it reveals about itself .

		And in these days we need the special admonition to study details only for better appreciation of the whole .

		Then , strangely forgetting that he has damned judicial criticism irrevocably , Professor
Moul	PERSON	- ton declares that when we have read a book to see what it says , in a spirit of '' friendly hostility , '' `` we can proceed to estimates of value without risk of misjudgement '' !

		And at the end of the book we read : '' In all that has been said there is nothing derogatory to the idea of judicial criticism , '' and '' Nothing that has been said is hostile to the use of a priori reasoning in the discussion of litera - ture '' !

		After a few statements like these we rub our eyes , and wonder if we merely dreamed those hundred pages which dispose of judicial criticism as '' chaos , '' '' shifting sands , '' and the greatest enemy of art .

		But judicial criticism , we learn , may gain inde - pendent value as literature by revealing an interesting personality .

		This , then , becomes `` subjective criticism . ''

		Professor
Moulton	PERSON	again blurs his terms here .

		We can only be thankful that he did not reprint the state - ment in the pamphlet just alluded to , that '' the critical writings of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	are valuable , not because they are true , but be - cause they throw light on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	. ''

		Thus is
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	dumped into the same pile with Lamb and
Hazlitt	PERSON	!

		The fundamental error in this reasoning is now apparent .

		It is essentially a consequence of the prevalent philosophy of flux , and is more
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 277 or less directly a result of the old romantic revolt which did not substitute principles for the rules which it discarded .

		In his theoreti - cal formulations , at least , Professor
Moulton	PERSON	illustrates beautifully the two manifestations of the age in which we have lived for over three generations , naturalism and impres - sionism .

		In the one , scientific observation replaces judgment ; and in the other , individ - ual and more or less irresponsible reaction drives out a common literary conscience .

		We do not mean that Professor
Moulton	PERSON	stands personally for this insidious relativity ; but that by discounting judgment and by exag - gerating temperamental differences in men , his theory supports the pervasive lawlessness which threatens to undermine our whole thought .

		Neither a theory of criticism nor a philosophy of life based on eternal change can satisfy our intellectual and spiritual needs .

		On only one other important point shall we quarrel with Professor
Moulton	PERSON	.

		In his endeavor to keep our eyes steadily on the literary work itself , he arbitrarily shuts us off from the assistance of biography and history .

		If he means that `` the greatest disturbing force to the pure study of literature is biog - raphy , '' then the method which finds its high - est expression in Sainte-Beuve is valueless .

		If , according to Professor
Moulton	PERSON	.

		our pri - mary concern is to find out what the author has said , to grasp the form in which he has written , how is it possible to understand the `` Romance of the Rose , '' much of the Bible , and the Elizabethan drama , without knowing the social milieu which gave them birth ?

		In spite of the dangers of being sidetracked , most of us will seek all the biographical and historical light that we can get .

		Passing now from these points at issue , we find Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's work as a whole so splendid in its sweep , so stimulating , that we scarcely know how to characterize its excel - lence .

		Without trying to appraise him as one of the large influences in American literary study , we may remind ourselves of his pio - neer and epoch-making work in '' The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' the method of which he sets forth in the volume before us .

		We owe to him significant emphasis on `` world litera - ture '' as a unit of study .

		He has given us , as no one before , a dazzling array of charts and diagrams illustrating relationships of the most varied kind .

		And he prevents these from becoming rigid and mechanical , and so mis - representative , by insisting on the endlessly varying combinations of elements in actual examples .

		Few writers , moreover , can give us happy allusion , illustration , brilliant for - mula , on almost every page ; few scholars can show equal insight into so many forms of literature .

		With all its extreme and erroneous posi - tions , '' The Modern Study of Literature '' commands admiration for the sheer daring and the completeness of its range .

		It is '' humane '' in its method and inspiring in its results .

		The crowning work of a long and useful life , it points the way to the best in literary study .

		INTER ARM A CARITAS .

		* If any remnants of human wisdom survive the era of murder and hysteria through which the world is now passing , it will be universally recognized that one great task must take precedence over all others , the task of inter - nationalism .

		Somehow , and soon , the ideal of human fraternity must be brought to prevail over the outworn creeds of nationalism and individualism .

		In that remote past of less than a score of months ago , we prided our - selves that progress had been made on that road , and that certain seemingly powerful influences Christianity , Socialism , the com - ity of literature and art and science were working on our side .

		What a ghastly jest now seems that belief !

		Almost with the first call to battle , we saw all the basic tenets of Christianity flouted and denied by the great majority of its followers , its Master de - graded to the office of a regimental chaplain , blessing the men and weapons that went forth to violate His injunction , `` Thou shalt not kill ! ''

		We saw international Socialism , founded in the faith that the workers of all nations are comrades in a common cause , go down like a house of cards , its adherents as ferocious as any in the work of mutual exter - mination .

		We saw the intellectuals of every country , poets , novelists , philosophers , scien - tists , ail who labor to keep alive those impar - tial fires that light and warm the spirit of man in its upward struggle , we saw these consecrating their gifts to the fostering of hatred and bitterness , selling their intellectual birthright for the pottage of a recruiting ser - geant .

		> And for those who still hold faithful to the vision of human brotherhood , it is these things no less than the bloody interminable harvest of the machine gun , the broken hearts and ruined lives , the desolated towns , the starving millions that over-run the cup of tragedy in these black days .

		278 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	But the cause of internationalism , though for the moment defeated , is far from being crushed .

		The very disaster which seems to overwhelm it will yet prove its mightiest ally , for it will unseal the sight of even the dullest - witted to the utter impossibility of going on with the old system of sectional rancours and jealousies and misunderstandings which has resulted in this cataclysm .

		From every cor - ner of
Europe	LOCATION	are beginning to be heard the voices of those who believe with
Jaures	PERSON	that `` the need of unity is the profoundest and noblest of the human mind , ' ' those who will not be swept off their feet by the whirlwind of popular passions , who will not hate their fellows at the command of government or press , who will not turn traitor to their own ideals in the hour when those ideals are in direst peril .

		Of these free and firm spirits of
Europe	LOCATION	, the foremost is
Romain Rolland	PERSON	, whose scat - tered writings on the war are now brought together and published , in adequate trans - lation , under the title , `` Above the Battle . ''

		Readers of '' Jean-Christophe '' will recall the prophecy in that book of the present debacle , and know with what earnestness
M. Rolland	PERSON	has striven to rouse the young men of
Europe	LOCATION	to a realization of their danger .

		Aware of the gathering tempest , he prepared himself to meet it ; and while it has raged , almost alone among the intellectual leaders of the day , he has kept his moral integrity without taint of compromise , in the face of calumny and insult unstinted .

		From the neutral ground of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, where he gives the greater part of his time to the beneficent work of the
Agence Internationale	ORGANIZATION	des prisonniers de guerre , he looks down upon the battle with spirit purged of hatred , endeavoring to understand and to make his fellows under - stand its significance and its lessons .

		We have said that
M. Rolland	PERSON	has suffered insult and calumny at the hands of his coun - trymen .

		`` Worst of all , he has been condemned without a hearing .

		For nearly a year , as he tells us , `` no one in
France	LOCATION	could know my writings except through scraps or phrases ar - bitrarily extracted and mutilated by my enemies . ' '

		But these scraps and phrases were sufficient to show that he had not surrendered his ideals and his intelligence , that he refused to be blindly implacable toward the enemy , and so the hue and cry was roused against him .

		The time is surely coming when every generous Frenchman will blush with shame at the memory of such treatment accorded to the man whom
France	LOCATION	should most honor .

		No indictment of German militarism could be less compromising , no praise of the noblest French traditions more just , than
M. Rol	PERSON	- land 's ; his crime , in the eyes of his country - men , is that he refuses to hate wholeheartedly , and to renounce all allegiance save that to the French cause .

		But to
M. Rolland	PERSON	, the tragedy of this war is the tragedy of humanity as a whole .

		He believes that `` each of the nations is being menaced in its dearest possessions in its honor , its independence , its life . ''

		His heart goes out to the young men , not of his own country only , but of all countries , who immolate themselves upon a common altar . ''

		young men that shed your blood with so generous a joy for the starving earth !

		heroism of the world !

		What a harvest for destruction to reap under this splendid
summer	DATE	sun !

		Young men of all nations , brought into conflict by a common ideal , making enemies of those who should be brothers ; all of you , marching to your death , are dear to me .

		Slavs , hastening to the aid of your race ; Englishmen fighting for honor and right ; intrepid Belgians who dared to oppose the Teutonic colossus , and defend against him the Thermopyla3 of the
West	LOCATION	; Germans fighting to defend the philosophy and the birthplace of Kant against the Cossack avalanche ; and you , above all , my young compatriots , in whom the generation of heroes of the Revolution lives again ; you , who for years have confided your dreams to me , and now , on the verge of battle , bid me a sublime farewell . ''

		And as a complement to this , let us quote one more passage , which we of this country now need to take to heart even more than those for whom the words were written : '' While the war tempest rages , uprooting the strongest souls and dragging them along in its furious cyclone , I continue my humble pilgrimage , trying to discover beneath the ruins the rare hearts who have remained faithful to the old ideal of human fraternity .

		What a sad joy I have in col - lecting and helping them ! ''

		I know that each of their efforts like mine that each of their words of love , rouses and turns against them the hostility of the two hostile camps .

		I The combatants , pitted against each other , agree I in hating those who refuse to hate .


Europe	LOCATION	is like I a besieged town .

		Fever is raging .

		Whoever will not rave like the rest is suspected .

		And in these hurried times when justice can not wait to study evidence , every suspect is a traitor .

		Whoever in - sists , in the midst of war , on defending peace among men knows that he risks his own peace , his reputation , his friends , for his belief .

		But of what value is a belief for which no risks are run ? ''

		Certainly it is put to the test in these days , when every day brings the echo of violence , injus - tice , and new cruelties .

		But was it not still more tried when it was entrusted to the fishermen of
Judea	LOCATION	by him whom humanity pretends to honor still with its lips more than with its heart ?

		The rivers of blood , the burnt towns , all the atrocities of thought and action , will never efface in our tor - tured souls the luminous track of the Galilean barque , nor the deep vibrations of the great voices which from across the centuries proclaim reason as
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 279 man 's true home .

		You choose to forget them , and to say -LRB- like many writers of today -RRB- that this war will begin a new era in the history of mankind , a reversal of former values , and that from it alone will future progress be dated .

		That is always the language of passion .

		Passion passes away .

		Reason remains reason and love .

		Let us continue to search for their young shoots amidst the bloody ruins . ''

		I feel the same joy when I find the fragile and valiant flowers of human pity piercing the icy crust of hatred that covers
Europe	LOCATION	, as we feel in these chilly
March days	DATE	when we see the first flowers appear above the soil .

		They show that the warmth of life persists below the surface of the earth , that fraternal love persists below the surface of the nations , and that soon nothing will prevent it rising again . ''

		There is little in all this which a recruiting sergeant or a leader-writer would find to his purpose ; but the spirit embodied in these lines is one that shall yet redeem mankind , and make of the earth something nobler than an abattoir .

		Those who read about the war for the pur - pose of feeding their prejudices and nourish - ing their hatreds will find small sustenance in
M. Holland	LOCATION	's pages .

		Their spirit is as remote from the great mass of war literature as a star is remote from the sputtering gas - lights of a city .

		No saner counsel has yet been heard above the turmoil of the conflict .

		Here is a book which proves that the tradition of Goethe and
Carlyle	PERSON	is not yet dead , that at least one man lives in the world who can speak out with something of their eloquence and their wisdom in behalf of the eternal claims of humanity . ''

		For the finer spirits of
Europe	LOCATION	there are two dwelling-places : our earthly fatherland , and that other City of God .

		Of the one we are the guests , of the other the builders .

		To the one let us give our lives and our faithful hearts ; but neither family , friend , nor fatherland , nor aught that we love has power over the spirit .

		The spirit is the light .

		It is our duty to lift it above tempest , and thrust aside the clouds which threaten to obscure it ; to build higher and stronger , dominating the injustice and hatred of nations , the walls of that city wherein the souls of the whole world may assemble . '

		The first volume of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's edition of the `` Writings of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, '' re - viewed some time ago in THE DIAL -LRB-
May 16 , 1913	DATE	-RRB- , covered the first twenty-eight years of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's life , from
1767	DATE	to
1796	DATE	.

		In the lat - ter year
Adams	PERSON	, commissioned by President
Washington	LOCATION	as Minister to
Portugal	LOCATION	, was still at
The Hague	LOCATION	, where he had been for two years Minister Resident .

		He did not enter upon this Portuguese mission , however , for before he could leave for that country his father , President
John Adams	PERSON	, appointed him Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		He reached
Berlin	LOCATION	on
November 7 , 1797	DATE	.

		On his journey from the
Netherlands	LOCATION	to his new post he went to
London	LOCATION	; and there on
July 26 , 1797	DATE	, he was married to
Louisa Catherine Johnson	PERSON	, of a distinguished family of
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		A delicate portrait of this lady , made in this year by
Barber	LOCATION	, is placed at the front of the second volume .

		The Prussian mission lasted until
1801	DATE	, when
Adams	PERSON	was recalled by his father and returned to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The second volume closes with this change in his affairs .

		The five years , 1796-1801 , which it covers , coincided roughly , as to American history , with the last year of the presidency of
Washington	LOCATION	and with the administration of
John Adams	PERSON	; upon the con - tinent it witnessed the progress of
Napoleon	PERSON	's campaign in
Italy	LOCATION	, the Peace of Campo For - mio , the Egyptian expedition , the coup d'etat of Brumaire , and the war against the
Coalition	ORGANIZATION	, to the Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	.

		The documents which make up the third volume disclose activities no less varied .

		In
1801	DATE	,
Adams	PERSON	resumed the practice of law in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The next year he was elected to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and failed of elec - tion to the national
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		This defeat was compensated for when , in
February , 1803	DATE	,
Adams	PERSON	was elected to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Two years later he was appointed to the lately founded Boyl - ston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Because
Adams	PERSON	had pursued in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	a course displeasing to
Federalist Massachusetts	LOCATION	, in
1808	DATE	, another person was chosen to succeed him , whereupon he resigned his seat and prepared to devote his entire time to his professorship and to the practice of law .

		But President
Madison	PERSON	, in due recognition of this important acquisition from the Federalist ranks , soon nominated

March 16	DATE	firmed .

		He left
Boston	LOCATION	in
August	DATE	and , after experiencing no little trouble with British and Danish cruisers , he reached
Norway	LOCATION	in Sep - tember and
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in
October , 1809	DATE	.

		From
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	were written several letters found in the latter part of the third volume , all those contained , in the fourth -LRB- which covers the years 1811-1813 -RRB- , and a few of those in the fifth .

		About the end of
April , 1814	DATE	, however ,
Adams	PERSON	departed from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	for
Gothenburg	LOCATION	in
Sweden	LOCATION	, where with the other commissioners appointed by the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	he was to enter into nego - tiations looking toward the termination of war between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and his own country .

		These negotiations were removed , however , to
Ghent	ORGANIZATION	a change of which
Adams	PERSON	's judgment disapproved , but which he accepted .

		He ar - rived at
Ghent	LOCATION	on
June 24 , 1814	DATE	, continued there until
January 2 , 1815	DATE	, .

		and then travelled by way of
Brussels	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The latter city he had not visited since his stay there as a boy in
1785	DATE	.

		Though he had been appointed in
February Minister	DATE	to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the news of this new honor had not reached him , and he was still in
Paris	LOCATION	when the Emperor
Napoleon	PERSON	entered the city upon his return from
Elba	PERSON	.

		Shortly after this ,
Adams	PERSON	went to
London	LOCATION	and took up his residence in the country at
Boston House	ORGANIZATION	,
Little Baling	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last letter of the fifth volume is dated
March 31 , 1816	DATE	, when
Adams	PERSON	was still at this place .

		Of widest interest , perhaps , are the letters written by
Adams	PERSON	to his father and mother , to his wife , to his brothers , and to friends who were regular correspondents , especially Wil - liam
Vans Murray	PERSON	,
Rufus King	PERSON	,
Timothy Pickering	PERSON	,
William Plumer	PERSON	, and
W. H. Craw	PERSON	- ford .

		In the third volume is included a series of political letters published under the pen name of
Publius Valerius	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here Adams ap - pears as the sectional New Englander and the party man , exhibiting a point of view much modified after his breach with the Federal - ists .

		To a surprising degree he kept in close touch with the course of party politics in
America	LOCATION	, even when he was himself separ - ated by the
Atlantic	LOCATION	from active participa - tion in them .

		The dispatches which he wrote from his various diplomatic posts , to the sev - eral
Secretaries of State	ORGANIZATION	under whom he served , are weighty documents , always of high value for the history of the period when the neutrality of the
United States	LOCATION	, as at the pres - ent time , was under great strain from the violations of it by the belligerent powers , and for the yet darker years in which the
United States	LOCATION	was a combatant .

		His capacity for close observation made him a skilful reporter of what he saw and heard in
Europe	LOCATION	: his comments on the course of the war on the con - tinent are highly instructive .

		But of par - ticular interest to American readers of the present day is the account which he gives of the peace negotiations at
Ghent	LOCATION	, and of his activities in
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the early part of
1816	DATE	.

		Almost the last letter in the fifth volume , written from
London	LOCATION	, is concerned with the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Thus we are brought to the develop - ment of the
Florida	LOCATION	matter , with which
Adams	PERSON	later had so much to do .

		For the account of this we must await the publication of the succeeding volumes .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* There have always been women among the novelists , sometimes of the best , sometimes of the most popular , from the days of Mrs.
Behn	PERSON	, Mrs.
Manley	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Heywood	PERSON	.

		They were , in the early days of the English novel , as widely read as anyone else , perhaps more widely .

		A century later and now about a century ago , three women were among the notable workers in the field ,
Miss Austen	LOCATION	,
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	, and
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	.

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	has long had a secure place among the few immortals ;
Miss Edgeworth	LOCATION	is still re - membered and read , and in her own day had the distinction of suggesting to Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	that he should try to do what she had done ;
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	, in spite of great apprecia - tion in her time , has slipped from sight .

		One would not select Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	, Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Gertrude Ather	PERSON	- ton as the three representative woman novel - ists of the present day , and yet all are well known and widely read .

		They group them - selves together now , only by the chance of publishing books at about the same time .

		Yet if not the chief women among the novelists of to-day , they are certainly representative enough to allow a comparison to run through the mind for a moment .

		One would at first say , How times have changed !

		Here we have nowadays a detective story , a story with an idea , a character study , where a hundred years ago we had simply those pictures of life and manners that seemed to Sir
Walter	PERSON	so well worth while , and of which the best are so interesting to-day .

		Or else we might say , What different women !

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 281 Imagine this modern business woman , this club-leader and society-woman , not to say this rebel against the conventional life of the cathedral close ; compare them with those rather prim young ladies of the earlier , Georgian days .

		It is not worth while to pur - sue the parallel ; a suggestion is enough to show that there is much in the books of one time that is characteristic .

		We must not make too much of it .

		They had novels with an idea a hundred years ago ;
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	, for in - stance , wrote one called '' Marriage . ''

		I do not remember it in the least , but I doubt not that her view was very different from
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	's .

		They were as intent on character then as now , indeed , I think more so ; Mr.
Collins	PERSON	and Mrs.
Bennet	PERSON	are still delightful .

		I do not remember any detective stories ; though there were mysteries perhaps as deep as that of the
Long Island	LOCATION	town unravelled by Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	.

		I am more struck by the other difference as I think of an earlier date .

		Those books at least those by
Miss Austen	PERSON	,
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	,
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	were more alike in method and intention than are these .

		They were all novels of manners , all views of the world around those keen-eyed ladies which they thought would be interesting to those about them .

		These three books are very different from each other .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's is a picture of a character , a temperament , that reminds one of her first success , '' The Divine Fire . ''

		Miss
Glasgow	LOCATION	's is the realization of an idea which perhaps she has had in mind ever since ''
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	, with her rang - ing view , has hit upon the idea of writing a detective story which should illustrate some of the foolishnesses and weaknesses of American democracy .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	has been eminently successful , and that in a way in which many of the nov - elists of our day entirely fail .

		She has suc - ceeded in creating character .

		Her people are not merely the abstractions demanded by the plot ; they have a '' real '' existence , as we are apt to say ; they make for themselves about all the plot there is .

		They are simply a group of people , and we follow out the story because we are interested in them and want to see what they will do .

		In the long run the ability to do this sort of thing is the great gift in fiction ; no power as a story-teller , no gift at portraying manners or atmosphere , will keep a book alive so long as a vital character .

		People remember characters and talk about them ; they remain in their mind .

		Strangely enough , character alone does not seem to be able in itself to carry us through a book ; we want a story .

		But after we have had the story we often forget it .

		People remember very lit - tle of the stories of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	in comparison with their people .

		So , indeed , it is with Miss Sinclair herself ; almost every - body remembers the poet in '' The Divine Fire , '' but few , I fancy , remember the story in which we were so interested when we first read it .

		So it will be , perhaps , with '' The Belfry '' : it has an idea , as is indicated by its title ; it has an atmosphere , at the end at least , that of the tense and fervid days of
August , 1914	DATE	.

		And these things may have been more interesting to Miss Sinclair than anything else ; certainly every one should have his eye open to them .

		But the thing that stands in one 's mind is this man
Jimmy	PERSON	, as he is commonly called .

		He is a striking per - sonage ; the mind in vain says that he is im - possible , that there has never been any such wonderful master of fiction and the drama and everything else , that it is simply an in - vention of
Miss Sinclair	LOCATION	's that one could so calculate beforehand and so perform .

		Those facts -LRB- as probably they are -RRB- seem to lose sig - nificance in the view of this tense , concen - trated person who seems unlike anybody we ever saw , and yet very natural as well .

		He was a reporter bent on being a great man of letters ; of a vivid , excited energy when he was himself ; bent on success , calculating his chances with an infernal omniscience -LRB- espe - cially of things other people give up , such as women , the future of books , and so on -RRB- ; de - termined to have this or that in three weeks or six months , and finally attaining inordin - ate success .

		He was to the ordinary eye something of a freak , rather vulgar -LRB- he never got over some things -RRB- : but there was another side to him , he had a grave tenderness , an unselfish delicacy of feeling , an immediate comprehension of things that were fine .

		In fact , in the main a man who was spiritual -LRB- if one word will do it -RRB- in that he cared only for what are now somewhat vaguely called the things of the spirit .

		To create such a personage is no slight mat - ter , but
Miss Sinclair	LOCATION	goes a bit further .

		This man and the other lesser figures who group themselves around him , the woman who first understands him , the man who reports his career perhaps without understanding even at the end , they embody somehow a view of life , a way of looking at life that is stimulat - ing and that arouses us out of our accustomed modes of thought in an effort to get at what is worth while .

		Perhaps they did not them - selves wholly attain it , there is certainly no systematic evolution of an idea ; but even if they did not , we may get it perhaps better than any one of them did .

		This man who at 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	first had the specific power to see what was worth seeing in the
Belfry of Bruges	LOCATION	, and who afterward seemed to lose himself in pre - occupations as to social relations with the county and the possibilities of a new automo - bile , did he keep his hold on the essential things ?

		Such a question and others come to mind as we follow the complications and de - velopments of his career .

		But the main thing is rightly done ; and however it was with him , we fqel that we see in his life something that made it worth while to put that life before us .

		Miss
Glasgow	LOCATION	is a bit more definite .

		We should find it hard to say whether she had first in mind
Gabriella	PERSON	or the idea that Gab - riella finally gained from her experience of life .

		We rather think the latter . ' '


Virginia	LOCATION	, ' ' a few years ago , was the story of a woman whose life appeared a failure because it had been too definitely moulded by old ideas , set - tled by forces that were no longer effective in the world to-day .


Virginia	LOCATION	was true to the conventions of a passing era , and could not really live on into the new atmosphere of a changing world .

		Gabriella is a different woman .

		She is a product of the same era , is born and brought up in the same conventions , but she gets away from them or -LRB- more ex - actly -RRB- is gotten away from them and forced to live in new conditions and keep alive in new currents of existence .

		Whatever be the fact of creation , the result in impression seems clear enough .

		We feel the thing that
Gabriella	PERSON	does more distinctly than we feel
Gabriella	PERSON	herself .

		She is a South - ern girl , living in '' reduced circumstances '' in
Richmond	LOCATION	, taken from the South to
New York	LOCATION	by an emotional marriage and stranded there to make her own way in the world .

		She makes her way , makes a life for herself as a modern business woman , looks out successfully for herself and successfully brings up her children .

		Accompanied all along by a vague dream of past idealism , she finally attains a surer reality and a more logical reward .

		The idea seems the main thing , and hence there is a certain hardness of touch in the presentation of character .

		All this may be in keeping : Miss
Polly	PERSON	says of
Gabriella	PERSON	that there was always a hard streak somewhere down in her , and that she got no softer ; and she says her - self that if she had been '' soft '' she would have long been broken .

		But it is not really a question of hardness of character or hardness of touch .

		It is rather a question of whether we have here a generalization from life or a rendering of a bit of life itself .

		With
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	, as has been said , we have a rendering of an impression so vivid that the generaliza - tion -LRB- left to us if we choose -RRB- is not always to be got at .

		With
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	we never miss the idea : we always feel clearly that women like men must make their own lives -LRB- whether as dress-makers or otherwise -RRB- , and not drift along as chance and men may will or allow .

		We always have that , but we rather miss the effective reality that we should like to have too .

		It is not that
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	lacks the ability to describe , to present people or situ - ations ; she has a considerable gift in such things .

		One feels rather that one is following a preconceived idea rather than being shown some of the strangely complex workings of the human spirit .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's book seems something of a new departure , at least for her .

		On the face of it , it is a pure detective story .

		A woman is driven to plan to murder her husband ; then her husband is murdered ; then every - body takes hold in the effort to unravel the mystery , with a result which -LRB- of course -RRB- is highly unexpected and natural .

		It may be that Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	was merely trying her hand at a form of literature in which some striking successes have been attained .

		It is more likely , however , that with her mystery and its solution well in mind Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	was a good deal interested in a curious mat - ter suggested thereby , namely , the singular way in which democracy deals with crime .

		She has written a good deal about all sorts of phases of American life , and would be rather likely to see an opportunity in such a topic .

		Whatever she saw , the thing is more or less there the case tried by the community led by an earnest band of reporters for the
New York	LOCATION	papers .

		That is a curious study , and worth a little thought .

		There is , further , a suspicion that Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	may feel that she is portraying a great character , a character really great in spite of the insignificant cir - cumstances in which it exists ; she invites com - parison with that stock horror Medea .

		But whatever there be , it has eluded me , or else I have not been clever enough to get it .

		I do j not feel the '' woman and the glory '' that seem to be alluded to in the motto ; nor does j Mrs.
Balfame	PERSON	seem terrible in her story .

		But I that it is a minor matter ; if she is terrible , then so much the better for the readers .

		Take it all in all , I feel that
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	is the one who has really made the hit .

		What - ever the charm in a good story , whatever the fascination in the real appreciation of ideas to the life of to-day , neither has quite the excit - | ing thrill of that contact with actual life itself that one gets , or feels one gets , in a set of good characters .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 283 BRIKFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		Essa - s in the ^ ^ e v l ume > ' ' The Greek Tra - reconst ruction of dition , '' -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr. lought -
J. A. K. Thomson	PERSON	presents eight papers , with the captions : '' On an Old Map . ''

		`` Thucydides , '' `` Greek Country Life , '' `` Alcestis and Her Hero , '' `` A Note on Greek Simplicity , '' `` Lucretius , '' `` The Springs of Poetry , ' ' and ' ' Some Thoughts on Translation . ' '

		With these is included a play - let , `` Mother and Daughter , '' dealing with the Persephone myth .

		Unfortunately , there is no such unity in the work as is implied by the general title ; but the sub-title , ' ' Essays in the Reconstruction of Ancient Thought , '' would have been fairly descriptive of the contents , if our author had omitted the arti - cles on `` Lucretius '' and `` Translation , '' which have a very doubtful value in any case .

		Now one is always grateful to a writer who essays to approach old problems with a new torch in his hand ; and on this ground Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	deserves our thanks .

		There is a dis - tinctly stimulating atmosphere of freshness about most of these pages .

		It is a pleasure to view
Heracles	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Alcestis '' as a `` komic '' hero , or to trace the kinship of the poet with his primitive forbears .

		It is de - lightful to sympathize with old geographers , or to share the thought and feeling of the Greek dweller in the country .

		And yet one would hesitate to recommend the volume ex - cept to classical scholars who are in a posi - tion to check the author 's contentions by their own knowledge and investigation .

		However , most other readers will be warned off by the general title , although it ought to be most j attractive ; so we need not worry on that score , j Readers of the prescribed type will enjoy the i book ; but will always be under arms .

		High discourse Not onl y bv a strong general re - many semblance in thought and style , i but also by innumerable little > self - betrayals in such details as favorite sole - !

		cisms and tricks of expression , does the anony - mous book , `` Father Payne '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , | declare itself to be from the same pen that !

		wrote `` The Upton Letters , '' `` Beside Still I Waters , ' ' and the many other volumes of that ; agreeable series with which Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	has for the last dozen years or more been enriching our literature .

		Through the medium of Father
Payne	PERSON	, a genial and cultivated layman who has gath - i ered half a dozen young and devoted disciples ; about him .

		and of other characters in the book , the author gives free and full utterance to a multitude of his own thoughts and opin - !

		ions , with skilfully interwoven shreds of personal experience , all strung loosely on a thread of narrative that helps to hold the attention and enhance the interest .

		Of Father
Payne	PERSON	himself , admirably conceived and clearly and consistently presented , we are told he was not `` a perfect character , with a tranquil and effortless superiority , or with a high intellectual tenacity , or with an unruf - fled serenity .

		He was sensitive , impatient , fitful , prejudiced .

		He had little constructive capacity , no creative or dramatic power , no loftiness of tragic emotion ... But he was vital , generous , rich in zest and joy , heroic , as no other man I had ever known .

		He had no petty ambition , no thirst for rec - ognition , no acidity of judgment .

		He never sought to impress himself : but his was a large , affectionate , liberal nature , more responsive to life , more lavish of self , more disinterested than any human being that had crossed my path .

		He had never desired to make dis - ciples he was not self-confident or self - regarding enough for that .

		But he had con - tinued to draw us all with him into a vortex of life , where the stream ran swiftly , and where it seemed disgraceful to be either list - less or unconcerned . ' '

		With such a character as leading figure , and with others more or less cognate and sympathetic , and with an author of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's wealth of thought and sug - gestion to develop these several characters and record their utterances , how could the book fail to please ?

		of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The recent coronation of the
123rd Mikado of Japan	ORGANIZATION	has .

		stimulated interest in that unique imperial line .

		A real opportunity for research and critical appraisement was af - forded to some scholar to study the influence of the Mikados throughout the entire history of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		But it can not be said that Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	has made the most of this opportunity in his latest volume , '' The Mikado : Institution and Person '' -LRB- Prince - ton
University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		First of all , the work is entirely uncritical .

		Two quotations indi - cate the point of view .

		The dedication reads : `` Believing , with all loyal Japanese , that the glory of
Japan	LOCATION	's triumphs in peace and war is due to ` the virtues of the
Mikado	LOCATION	's ances - tors , ' each one of whom was ` the son of
Adam	PERSON	, the son of God . '

		the author dedicates this work to all lovers of truth in
Everlasting Great Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		And later we note : '' In the vista of the twentieth century , how vast the changes !

		.

		.

		The supreme influence in the transformation has been that of the Man of Peace ,
Mutsuhito	LOCATION	, Emperor of Divine ,
Uncon	LOCATION	- 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	querable Everlasting ,
Great Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Al - though , it seems too much to expect Japanese scholars to scrutinize over-carefully the impe - rial traditions and myths , yet a foreign scholar should assert a reasonable indepen - dence .

		Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	does set aside the prehistoric claims , yet he falls into almost as unrea - soned glorification of the late Emperor .

		It detracts little from the high opinion in which we may hold Mutsuhito to recognize that he was , after all , human , and that he was most fortunate in the advisers whom he gathered around him .

		The present volume , therefore , contains a brief resume of Japanese history before the accession of Mutsuhito in
1867	DATE	, a fuller account of the early years of his reign , many interesting details about his life and character , but , unfortunately , a very brief account of his later years , when his influence must have been at its height .

		Throughout , the author maintains a personal note , throw - ing into relief the period of the early seven - ties , when he was in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		But a more serious over-emphasis lies in the undue impor - tance attached to the foreign teachers and advisers , Dr.
Verbeck	PERSON	, for instance , being mentioned more often than Prince
Ito	PERSON	, the greatest of Japanese statesmen , and non - American advisers are rarely included .

		How - ever , notwithstanding certain inaccuracies in details , and the other features already men - tioned , many readers will find this contribu - tion distinctly interesting and suggestive .

		A Russian on Russian literature .

		Under the new title of `` Ideals and Realities in Russian Litera - ture , '' Mr.
A. Knopf	PERSON	reissues Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	's Lowell Lectures of
1901	DATE	, originally published in
1905	DATE	as `` Russian Literature . ''

		The reprint is not a new edi - tion , for the matter and even the paging is identical in the two volumes ; yet the value of the book is so genuine that the critic ac - cepts it with no more than a passing wish that into the bibliography , at least , might have been introduced some notes of recent publications in the field .

		Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	accepts quite evidently , though perhaps sub - consciously ,
Tourgenieff	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy of art : `` A truly talented writer is the condensed expression of life ' ' ; and consequently he does not fall into the easy abstractions which so often lighten work for our own critics .

		He refuses to classify his poets and novelists as ' ' realists , '' ' ' naturalists , '' '' romanticists ' ' ; and he studies
Gogol	PERSON	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	,
Tourgenieff	LOCATION	,
Goncharov	PERSON	, and their various followers , with the aim not of appraising each man 's place in a scale of Slavic values , or even the con - tribution of each to the definition of
Russia	LOCATION	, but rather of discovering the peculiar quality of every one of these men and of the special revelations of human life which he makes .

		The only common trait he finds in all of them is a fearless love of experience that brings beauty out of terror and significance out of pain ; the Russian pessimism of which so much has been written means no more to this critic than other catch terms , for he keeps his eye so fixed upon the concrete facts of expression that he finds no importance in a general term that ignores all specific differences in the works of art it groups together .

		He studies accurately and fully
Tolstoi	PERSON	's novels and re - ligion as mutually inter-active , just as he interprets
Tourgenieff	ORGANIZATION	's relation to the social revolutions of his time as conditioning the characters in ' ' Fathers and Sons , '' ''
Rudin	PERSON	, ' ' and `` Virgin Soil . ''

		Carrying his analysis back into folk-lore and forward into modern journalism , Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	brings to his subject a large comprehension much to be desired in every writer of such a handbook ; his method results in turning every reader of his lectures to some of the many transla - tions of Russian novels , tales , and plays therein described .

		, Explorers , excavators , and de - 7 he sweep of f ' ' .

		Babylonian .

		cipherers have staged in the
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	!!

		valley one of the most marvellous civilizations of ancient times .

		Seventy years have sufficed to resurrect , from the ruinous mounds and wastes of that valley , peoples and cultures that have already revo - lutionized our interpretation of ancient his - tory .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's `` The Civilization of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- aims to present a popular survey of the civiliza - tion which arose in the
Euphrates	LOCATION	valley in the dim twilight of history , and to sketch its growth and vicissitudes down through time almost to the Christian era .

		It is an ambi - tious scheme of an intrepid scholar .

		The task has been fairly successful .

		Of the eight chap - ters into which the large volume is broken up , the second , on the ' ' The Decipherment of the Cuneiform Script , '' and the fifth , on `` The Cults and Temples of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and Assy - ria , '' are the least considerate of the popular reader .

		In these chapters the author discusses many details that have no interest for the lay reader , and will tempt him to drop the book .

		The freshest chapter is that on '' Law and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' where large use is made of the '' Code of Hammurabi '' and the contract tablets which have been found by the thou - sands from the earlier periods of Babylonian and especially Sumerian history .

		The volume is tastefully and appropriately illustrated by
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 285 seventy-eight `` plates , which add greatly to the interest that will be aroused by the text .

		Tak - ing text and illustrations together , we have here , without doubt , the best single volume yet issued on the nations who for about three thousand years occupied the Babylonian valley .

		A very interesting study of the Canadian people and their prob - lems , internal and external , is furnished by Miss
Agnes C. Laut	PERSON	in her '' Canadian Commonwealth '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		During the last few years a number of books have appeared on
Canada	LOCATION	and her peo - ple , but all have been more or less conventional in treatment and superficial in scope .

		Miss Laut has attempted , with at least a measure of success , to get underneath the surface of things , and discover the national consciousness of this young people ; what more or less con - sciously it is striving for ; its ideals , and where they are likely to lead .

		Miss Laut sees ele - ments of weakness as well as of strength in the Canadian character , but her final judg - ment is optimistic .

		She believes that
Canada	LOCATION	possesses both the ability and the energy to handle wisely the really serious problems that confront her , such as `` the amalgamation of the foreigner through her schools : a working arrangement with the Oriental fair to him as to her ; the development of her natural re - sources ; the anchoring of the people to the land ; and the building of a system of power - ful national defense by sea and land '' ; and that her ultimate destiny is to become a
Greater Britain	LOCATION	Overseas .

		The American During the celebration of the college : a one hundredth anniversary of the founding of Allegheny Col - lege , a conference on the American college was held .

		Educators well qualified to deal with the subject were selected to discuss vari - ous topics , with the understanding that they should speak out their minds freely .

		The topics were chosen with care to avoid dupli - cations and yet broadly to cover the whole field .

		`` In short , it was aimed to include .

		.

		the essential things pertaining to the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can college as a present-day institution and as an institution of promise for the future educational development of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The papers that were read at this notable sympo - sium have been collected by President
Craw	PERSON	- ford of
Allegheny College	ORGANIZATION	and published by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		In stating that they measure up to the occasion , the reviewer feels that he is bestowing upon them the highest praise .

		Among the themes dealt with are the place in the curriculum of the languages and literature , : of the social sciences and history , and of the physical and natural sciences ; the function of the college as distinct from other institutions of learning ; the college as a preparation for professional study and for practical affairs ; and the present status and probable future of the college in various sections of the country .

		Among the speakers were President
Faunce	PERSON	of
Brown	PERSON	, Professor
Shorey	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Dean Haskins	PERSON	of
Harvard , President Thwing of Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, and President
Meiklejohn	PERSON	of
Amherst	LOCATION	.

		Peculiarly significant is the attention given to the service rendered by the stronger type of privately endowed college , such as
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	and
Colorado	LOCATION	, whose presi - dents -LRB- Messrs. Few and Slocum -RRB- participated in the discusssion .

		Commissioner
Claxton	PERSON	, last on the programme , made a suggestive plea for contraction rather than expansion of effort by colleges proper ; for junior college work by some -LRB- two years of instruction by really capable teachers -RRB- , and for limitation of courses by others to a few well-organized groups of subjects .

		Mr. M asefieid 's ^ work on the mysterious and recollection * of unfathomable
Synge	PERSON	, incarna - we - tion of the spirit of the Celtic revival , by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	, a sort of exemplar of modern English poetry , promises largely of piquancy and interest .

		Somehow the thing does not quite come off .

		Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field insists that there was a great deal in
Synge	PERSON	's face , that his silence was very expres - sive , that his very preoccupation and aloof - ness hinted at genius .

		As to just why these things were so , we are not given any illumi - nating enlightenment .

		The picture of
Synge	PERSON	on the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	, as the uncrowned poetic king of that strange people , fades out before the picture of Synge as a sort of itinerant musician , Jack-of-all-trades , or playboy , now fiddling away tentatively , now making penny-whistles for nothing , now doing tricks to astonish and confound , now telling stories to amuse all for the strange people who thought he was paying the debt of conscience , that he was one who had once committed some great crime and fled thither from the heart of
Europe	LOCATION	to expiate in solitude .

		It is cer - tainly worth remembering that
Synge	PERSON	's favor - ite author , for the greater part of his life , was
Racine	LOCATION	according to the impression which Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	received .

		Ironic spirit seeking refuge from the embittered conscious - ness of self and century in the simplicity of the primitive this was Synge .

		Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field well says of this man who died of the dread malady : '' He covered his tragedy with mockeries . ''

$ 1.35	MONEY	net 310 THE DIAL IN the
April	DATE	number of the Open Court magazine , Professor
Lindley M. Beasley	PERSON	of the
University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	analyses the conditions which have caused the
Balance of Trade	ORGANIZATION	to swing west from
Alexandria	LOCATION	, 200 B. C. to
London	LOCATION	,
1916	DATE
A. D.	ORGANIZATION	and also present conditions which are now swinging the Bal - ance of Trade from
London	LOCATION	to
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		The history of money and of the balance of trade shows that the center of exchange has shifted from
Babylon	LOCATION	to Tyre and
Sidon	LOCATION	,
Corinth	LOCATION	and
Athens	LOCATION	,
Alexandria	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	; then back again to
Constantinople	LOCATION	, then west to
Venice	LOCATION	and
Genoa	LOCATION	, up the Danube and down the Rhine to
Hamburg	LOCATION	and
Antwerp	LOCATION	and
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, and finally to
England	LOCATION	.

		The time has come for the pendulum to swing again .

		Lombard Street ,
London	LOCATION	, is the key to the present world struggle .

		There are evidences of an impending change .

		It is an inexorable law that exploitation allows ineffi - ciency and tends to diminishing returns ; pro- duction requires efficiency and tends toward increasing returns .

		Quoting Professor
Beasley	PERSON	: `` The colossal struggle between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	is a contest for the control of the center of exchange but whether or not Ger - many wins this war ,
England	LOCATION	will be the loser .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	wins , the center of trade goes to
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		If
Germany	LOCATION	loses , the center of trade goes to
America	LOCATION	.

		`` I am not in the least prejudiced in behalf of the Teutons , '' says Professor
Beasley	PERSON	.

		`` The facts themselves establish my claims that Aus - tria and
Germany	LOCATION	are the legitimate succes - sors and modern representatives of the pro- ductive activities of the ancient and medieval world .

		* * * * `` Geographic and ethnic antecedents always induce , economics and political consequences .

		If we understand this colossal struggle between
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	we must descend from the heights of philosophical speculation to the depth of economical analysis .

		* * * * `` Having unduly extended her exploitative base and unwisely restricted her productive activities ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	is facing just such a disaster as confronted the Alexandrian Em - pire of old .

		`` One of the effects of a disturbance in the balance of trade is to arouse the resistance of inferior folk both at home and abroad .

		So it was with
Rome	LOCATION	of old .

		So it is with Eng - land today .

		`` On the verge of revolt are the laboring classes in
England	LOCATION	, the Irish , the Egyptians , the Indians and others across the sea .

		The Colonials are still loyal to be sure , but the disaster is only imminent as yet . ''

		346 MEDITATIONS OF A JACOBITE .

		The persistent admirer of
Henry James	PERSON	has long ago become hardened to the ridicule and the more serious criticism of those who adhere to the de facto dynasty in fiction , and he may even have become reconciled to the thought that the advocacy of his candidate for univer - sal favor is a hopeless cause .

		Yet now , in par - ticular , he can hardly refrain from making his profession of faith .

		Three of the criticisms that have of late been most frequently brought against the novelist concern the lack of action in his narratives , his moral tone and purpose , and his later prose style .

		The paucity of striking events in the novels is , as has often been said , a necessary con - sequence of the author 's conception of prose fiction .

		James 's plan for a novel is something like this : to take a few interesting but usually not freakish or eccentric characters ; to place them in a setting where they may be seen from different angles , or at least viewed in a particular character chosen as a `` reflector '' ; to show them in situations which lead to com - plicated mental experiences ; and to trace this inner experience through a course of exter - nal action ; the whole being bound , fused , unified for no one figure quite expresses the process into an artistic whole .

		The tone of such a composition is naturally subdued , and the action and the portrayal of character are presented by means of small suggestive inci - dents rather than by large dramatic ones .

		`` It is an incident , '' says the author , in `` The Art of Fiction , '' `` for a woman to stand up with her hand resting on a table and look out on you in a certain way . ''

		It is by means of little things , in themselves almost as trivial as the one he mentions , that his narrative proceeds ; and for this reason the movement is slow .

		Even the passages that seem most charged with dramatic significance are quiet and sub - dued as far from violence and shrieks and weeping as we have found most weighty moments in our own lives .

		There are many of these scenes that one remembers long , each perfect in its tone , its quiet impressive atmos - phere , and its calm vividness .

		Such , in `` The 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	American , '' is the death of
Valentin	ORGANIZATION	, after the duel in the little village across the Swiss frontier .

		A comparison of this scene with
Dickens	PERSON	's death of
Little Nell	ORGANIZATION	, and another with a death scene from some vivid naturalist , might afford a short and convenient test of a reader 's probable enjoyment of
James	LOCATION	.

		There are those who want to be brought to tears by a compelling pathos , and these will condemn the author of `` The American , '' as he has so often been condemned , for having nothing to do with the heart .

		There are others who would get the full terror of death , and feel the physical pangs with which body and spirit are torn apart , and perhaps gather a little pathological information on the side .

		These are they who complain that the author knows nothing of elemental human life , but wastes his time on mere conventional existence .

		Meanwhile
Valentin	PERSON	dies like a gentleman and a brave man , as most of us probably hope to die , and his friends talk cheerfully as they breakfast in the sunny inn parlor , and await the event with genuine but sensible decorum , just as we hope our friends will do when the end comes for us .

		And those who find that this latter scene touches with greatest cer - tainty the springs of their emotions , and leaves them with the most perfect realization of what life and death means , will probably become itrue Jacobites .

		Unforgettable pictures are found in the earlier work `` The Portrait of a Lady '' has several of them , and they are even more ad - mirable in the later novels .

		Two of the finest are in `` The Wings of the Dove '' both scenes between
Milly Theale	PERSON	and Lord
Mark	PERSON	, one before the portrait in the English country - house , the other in the Venetian palace .

		In `` The Golden Bowl '' is another , more a-tingle with suppressed tragedy , and even more alive with the air and manners of to-day , that in which the Princess looks in through the open window during her moonlight walk on the terrace , and sees the others at their game of bridge .

		Henry
James	PERSON	's moral tendencies have come in for a full measure of discussion .

		His ear - lier work kept clear of questionable topics , and the worst fault that the puritanically minded could find was that it did not point an obvious moral .

		In his later novels he has been much more free in his choice of subjects .

		Part of the bewilderment which this has brought to his critics is due to the fact that he has introduced wickedness , not for its own sake , but as the cause , condition , or accom - paniment of something else .

		Adultery con - stitutes a great part of the stock in trade of recent novelists , even of English and
Ameri	PERSON	- can novelists .

		It may be condemned though this treatment is now considered weak and old-fashioned , or it may be made attractive in the particular instance , and used as the basis of theories on the reorganization of society .

		James follows neither of these plans , but uses it incidentally in his situations .

		It is not the wickedness itself that forms the story of `` What Maisie Knew , '' or `` The Golden Bowl , '' or `` The Ambassadors , '' but the existence of the wickedness makes the story possible .

		This acceptance of evil as a natural and expected phenomenon of modern life , like illness or bankruptcy , seems to some ' readers cynical , and far more shocking than a frank defence of two guilty but interesting parties .

		It is another source of complaint that he presents this sin by implication .

		No doubt most of us have found to make again the trite appeal to our own experience that in ordinary circles of society the existence of this particular offence against the social order is usually inferred , rarely known from explicit proof .

		All of us have been so unfortunate as to know of suspected sinners , and perhaps to feel certain of their guilt , yet perhaps few of us have ever had definite knowledge that would carry weight in a court of law .

		But English and American novelists , acting with the frankness natural to an Anglo-Saxon when he treats a questionable subject at all , have generally put their readers in full pos - session of the facts .

		James 's usual method is to give much the same sort of circumstantial evidence that might be apparent in real life .

		The reader , unaccustomed to such a treat - ment in literature , hardly knows how to interpret the vague indications , and is hor - rified at his own uncertainty .

		More than one critic , afraid , perhaps , of being judged by the formula , `` evil to him who evil thinks , '' has hesitated over the question whether Mrs.
Verver	PERSON	and the Prince or
Merton Densher	PERSON	and
Kate Croy	PERSON	really sinned or not ; and it is those who in their puzzled innocence have inclined to answer the ques - tion in the negative that have most blamed the author for his suggestiveness .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 315 It is with something of fear and trembling that one approaches even for the briefest con - sideration the matter of
Henry James	PERSON	's later prose style .

		Nobody now would be so rash as to deny that , in the descriptive and auto - biographical works at least , it is often obscure , and few of the author 's most ardent admirers will say that it is always wholly pleasurable .

		But like other peculiarities that grow out of a friend 's personality , it has something that may be said in its defence .

		For it does , clearly , grow out of the personality of the man .

		Only the most superficial commenta - tors will accuse him , as
Browning	PERSON	was some - times accused , of puzzling his readers for the mere fun of the thing .

		Certainly he was genuine in feeling and action after
August , 1914	DATE	, and the last place where he would wil - fully have been obscure is in his writings on the war ; yet it was amusingly pathetic to note the perplexity of the English press , which seemed anxious to pay full respect to his utterances , but troubled to know just what they meant .

		None of the theories to account for the change in style is wholly satisfactory .

		It has been ascribed to the author 's habit of dictat - ing his later work ; and in support of this is offered testimony that his lectures , not the easiest of reading , seemed to those who heard them perfectly lucid .

		But this explanation hardly holds .

		A dictated style might be sup - posed to be a natural spoken style , to run on , and to be bewildering , if at all , because of undue looseness .

		These sentences are highly organized , carefully and artificially wrought .

		They differ from normal written English in just the opposite way from that in which con - versation differs .

		It is this sentence structure , not the diction , which is the most striking peculiarity of the later prose .

		With advanc - ing years the author came , if anything , to depend more and more on the brief and simple word .

		Take the well-known passage from `` The Wings of the Dove , '' in which Lord Mark brings
Milly Theale	PERSON	to the
Bronzino	ORGANIZATION	, which all say that she resembles : She got with her companion into the house ; they brushed , beneficently , past all their accidents .

		The
Bronzino	PERSON	was , it appeared , deep within , and the long afternoon light lingered for them on patches of old color and waylaid them , as they went , in nooks and opening vistas .

		It was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark had really had something other than this spoken pretext in view ; as if there were something he wanted to say to her and were only consciously , yet not awkwardly , just delicately hanging fire .

		At the same time it was as if the thing had prac - tically been said by the moment they came in sight of the picture ; since what it appeared to amount to was `` Do let a fellow who is n't a fool take care of you a little . ''

		The thing somehow , with the aid of the
Bronzino	PERSON	, was done ; it had n't seemed to matter to her before if he were a fool or no ; but now , just where they were , she liked his not being ; and it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of the same sound as Mrs.
Lowder	PERSON	's recent reminder .

		She too wished to take care of her and was n't it what all the people with the kind eyes were wishing ?

		Once more things melted together the beauty and the his - tory and the facility and the splendid midsummer glow : it was a sort of magnificent maximum , the pink dawn of an apotheosis coming so curiously soon .

		What in fact befell was that , as she after - ward made out , it was Lord Mark who said nothing in particular it was she herself who said all .

		She could n't help that it came ; and the reason it came was that she found herself , for the first moment , looking at the mysterious portrait through tears .

		Perhaps it was her tears that made it just then so strange and fair as wonderful as he had said : The face of a young woman , all splendidly drawn , down to the hands , and splen - didly dressed ; a face almost livid in hue , yet handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of hair , rolled back and high , that must , before fading with time , have had a family resemblance to her own .

		The lady in question , at all events , with her slightly Miehael-angelesque squareness , her eyes of other days , her full lips , her long neck , her recorded jewels , her brocaded and wasted reds , was a very great personage only unaccompanied by a joy .

		And she was dead , dead , dead .

		Milly I recognized her exactly in words that had nothing I to do with her .

		`` I shall never be better than this . ''

		With the habit of occasional obscurity came the power to write prose like this .

		Even in the most confusing sentences , the vocabulary is often almost as simple .

		Now a writer 's sentence structure is indicative of his habit of mind , and the growth in the complexity of sentences may come from the growth of a tendency to see a subject in all its subtle relations , and to present all these relations at one stroke .

		This is a difficult matter in an uninflected language , which must show the connection of ideas chiefly by the position of words .

		When there are so many conditions and modifications and exceptions to each prin - cipal idea , the phrases which express them can not be placed in close juxtaposition to the central term .

		A sentence so involved seems clear when delivered orally , because the voice shows grammatical relationships , as the word - endings do in an inflected language .

		In the 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	essay on Flaubert occurs one of the few passages in which the author allowed himself to speak disrespectfully of his mother tongue : What would have become of him and what of his wrought residuum , had he been condemned to deal with a form of speech consisting , like ours , as to one part , of `` that '' and `` which '' ; as to a second part , of the blest `` it , '' which an English sentence may repeat in three or four opposed ref - erences without in the least losing caste ; as to a third face of all the `` tos '' of the infinitive and the preposition ; as to a fourth of our precious auxiliaries `` be , '' and `` do '' ; and as to a fifth , of whatever survives in the language for the precious art of pleasing ?

		This outbreak may be significant .

		Would the author be as obscure if he worked in a different medium ?

		This suggestion surely does not explain all the phenomena of the later style ; but certainly the basis of these phenomena is psychological .

		It is chiefly in the essays that perplexities are to be found .

		Passages in the novels that trouble an atten - tive reader are relatively few , and occur not in the narrative , but in passages of expository analysis .

		The use of pet words and phrases of `` wonderful , '' ' and `` beautifully , '' and `` There you are , '' is only a mannerism , to be half enjoyed and half regretted , as a friend 's man - nerisms usually are .

		More significant is the great use of adjectives and adverbs , not thrown at random after the manner of the amateur who hopes that one of many may hit the mark , but each chosen with careful pre - cision .

		This use of modifiers undoubtedly comes from the feeling that greatest signifi - cance attaches , not to bare objects and actions , but to the light in which we see these , the associations they have for us , their subtle suggestiveness .

		Whether this is the proper view , whether it is the primrose by the river 's brim in its yellow and four-petalled self or something less tangible that is the important thing , whether the habit of looking at any - thing but the essential object does not lead to vaporing and foolishness , these questions are too fundamental to discuss .

		It is certain that
James	PERSON	has always made much of the emotional significance of wind and weather , of light and shade , of color and temperature , and still more of the differences of mood and manner in human action .

		His early productions abound in descriptions which , though realistic , make the feeling greater than the object , and in his later work he has refined oh this emotional presentation more and more .

		The narrative passages that impress us most , like the death of Valentin , or the scene just quoted from '' The Wings of the Dove , '' owe much of their charm to what has come to be called `` atmos - phere . ''

		This atmosphere is not created by the mere enumeration of objects ; objects , like the characters themselves , are seen in a `` reflector '' chosen by the author .

		The English afternoon , the country-house , the
Bronzino	ORGANIZATION	, are presented not as a camera might have portrayed them , but as they seem to
Milly Theale	PERSON	; and for such a presentation no mere list of substantives would suffice .

		A teacher of composition whose most frequent advice is `` Use fewer adjectives , '' hesitates long over a sentence like this from the lecture on `` The Novel in The Eing and the Book '' : Greatest of all the spirits exhibited , however , is that of the more than octogenarian Pope , at whose brooding , pondering , solitary vigil , by the end of a hard grey
winter	DATE	day in the great bleak waiting
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, '' in the plain closet where he does such work '' we assist as intimately as at every other step of the case , and on whose grand meditation we heavily hang .

		Yet it is plain that every one of these modi - fiers was chosen with care , and was meant to do its individual work .

		When all is said , it must be admitted that most readers find greatest pleasure in the style of the earlier , say the early middle , period ; but there are many passages in the later prose which the younger man , even at his best , could not have equalled .

		It is difficult to write about the ordinary current topics when
Henry James	PERSON	has just died .

		It would be impertinent to send an estimate of him to the country which had the honor of producing him ; but one can not help dwelling on him a little , for he was ours as well , ` like -LRB- to lapse into a grotesque simili - tude to which he would not have objected -RRB- the
Atlantic Cable	LOCATION	.

		As an interpreter his position had long been unique ; and lately we have also been tempted to imagine and hope him a symbol of a process which is bringing
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 317 the home of his immediate ancestors and that of his remoter ones to realize the immensity i of that which they have and feel and think ' in common when set against their local idio - syncrasies .

		Henry James excepting Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, one can scarcely think of another modern example was one of those extraordinary men whose powers go on strengthening in old ; age .

		The `` young old man '' whose enthusi - asms remain active , who preserves his vivacity and eagerness to learn , is comparatively common :
Samuel Butler	PERSON	would have still been an undergraduate had he lived to a hundred .

		But there is almost always a diminution of intensity .


Henry James	PERSON	not merely remained young in the ordinary sense , but at seventy his attention to life was unre - i laxed , he was still refining his perceptions , | adding to his accumulations of experience , and adapting his instrument to new purposes , i With all his unique sensibility and curiosity , he could not have done the work he did at the last without something still more remarkable : I a prodigious will-power .

		Though he did not ' socially play the hermit , he was as much a | Monk of Literature as
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, a self - \ dedicated artist who deliberately chose to j regard his genius as a wonderful thing held in trust ; and the last fruits of his self-dis - cipline were astonishingly unlike the usual exercises of the superannuated great writer , i - The Golden Bowl '' at sixty ; at sixty-six `` The American Scene , '' one of the greatest things he ever did ; and at the end some of his best criticisms and the two perfect autobiographical volumes : the collected product of this last period compares favorably with that of any j other period of his career .

		What it is impossible not to regret is the | unfinished state of the memoirs , of which a third , half-written , volume remains in manu - | script .

		They were begun as a memorial to a !

		dead brother ; they were growing into some - thing more .

		In his retrospect Mr.
James	PERSON	had just reached , I believe , the stage at which he \ began to make the acquaintance of Europeans , and particularly Frenchmen , of eminence .

		It | makes one think of what we have missed .

		The record of actual events and actual personages is usually left to second-rate authors .

		Even the finest biographies and books of `` reminis - cences '' that we have are mostly written by men .

		who , whatever their merits , have not great minds and are not artists of the first rank .

		What an extraordinary book we might have seen if
James	PERSON	's memoirs had run on into six or eight volumes , if that `` visiting mind , '' that scrutinous eye , had made per - manent their impressions of all they saw and assessed in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in the seventies , eighties , and nineties .

		The Gon - court Journal would have been superficial and scrappy beside it .

		But men , and especially men of creative power , usually -LRB- and for sev - eral comprehensible reasons -RRB- postpone work of this kind until too late .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	left also an unfinished novel .

		His latest published work is his introduction to
Kupert Brooke	PERSON	's prose which has just appeared under the title of `` Letters from
America	LOCATION	. ''

		You will already , I suppose , have seen the book on your side .

		The earlier of
Brooke	PERSON	's own letters betray , more in the choice of words than in constructions , a strong James influence : in this , and in the charming manner of Mr.
James	PERSON	's tribute , one has some indication of the relation in which the novel - ist stood to many of the younger English writers .

		The most enthusiastic of his devotees were to be found amongst his fellow-artists ; and it is significant that the poets in particu - lar read him .

		A wide public he did not reach .

		It appears likely that his early `` Daisy Miller '' had a larger circulation than any of his other works .

		The indifference with which some of them were received might have depressed a man less certain of his ability to do well a thing well worth doing ; one of the most im - portant of his later books sold , I believe , fewer than a thousand copies in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Many who should have been were not familiar with that large body of fine literature , so rich in beautiful detail , so full of revelations concerning the human mind and heart , and , one may add -LRB- for it is some - times missed -RRB- , of an implicit moral nobility .

		Yet , in a sense , in his later years his greatness was recognized here .

		He slipped quietly , characteristically quietly , into an `` established position '' ; and the Order of Merit which was given him on his death-bed was bestowed as his natural due and not at all as a mere com - pliment in return for the fine compliment he paid the country of his domicile when he became a naturalized British subject .

		His books , in spite of his alleged obscurity , which , where it exists , is always the defect of his unique qualities , may safely be commit - ted to Posterity .


Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's posthumous volume is being followed by a good many other collec - tions of the `` remains '' of young soldiers who have died in the field .

		They are mostly , how - ever , of interest mainly as memorials of promise -LRB- not necessarily poetic -RRB- cut short .

		Though there is naturally a temptation to see signs of unmatured genius in every volume of the sort , candor must confess that no artis - tic creation of permanent value has as yet 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	come to light in these collections .

		Most of the other verse that is appearing bears on the war ; and as a whole the effusions , however sound in doctrine and humane in feeling , of those who are inspired -LRB- if that is the word -RRB- by a sense of the bestiality and futility of the military view of life are neither better nor worse than the screeds of those who , from the seclusion of
Hampstead	LOCATION	and
Bayswater	LOCATION	, sing the Glories of the Flag and urge their com - batant compatriots to give the Hun what he deserves .

		The only interesting volumes of poems to appear recently have been two small ones by
F. S. Flint	PERSON	and
Richard Aldington	PERSON	.

		These young writers belong to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American coterie which , for some reason best known to itself , describes itself as `` Imagist . ''

		It is no more a school than I am : the only thing its members have in common is a revul - sion against the conventional stanza .

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	carries his reaction against the tradi - tional to excess .

		Like the gentleman in
Moliere	LOCATION	, he often talks prose without knowing it .

		But he works hard with his brain , and frequently makes one feel that he may do something good .

		`` Imagism '' as a name originated , I think , with your entertaining export , Mr.
Ezra Pound	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's muse appears to be rather inactive nowadays ; but he has just written a memoir of his friend Gaudier-Brzeska , the young Franco-Polish sculptor who was killed last year at
Neuville St Vaast	ORGANIZATION	.

		The spring novels have not been very excit - ing , though a number of authors of some repute have gone through their paces .

		The only one who has sprung a genuine surprise is Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	, whose book `` The Dark Forest , '' the fruit of his emotions at the front in the
Eastern Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, is by universal admis - sion easily the best thing he has written .

		It is hardly credible that it comes from the same pen as his previous book , a stream of most viscous sentiment about children .

		Nothing much is announced for the near future , but a large public will be interested to know that the official life of the late
Robert Hugh Benson	PERSON	is ready for publication .

		It has been written by Father
C. C. Martindale	PERSON	,
S. J.	PERSON	, who has several peculiar qualifications for the work .

		The most critical period in Monsignor
Benson	PERSON	's life will certainly have been sym - pathetically described ; for , like him , Father
Martindale	PERSON	-LRB- as a too impetuous speaker once put it -RRB- `` renounced the errors of the Church of
England	LOCATION	for those of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Father
Martindale	PERSON	is himself the author of several books .

		The last , `` The Goddess of Ghosts , '' has some extremely effective classical sketches in it , particularly two of Euripides and
Simonides	PERSON	in the throes of composition .

		His style inclines rather to the precious ; but his best passages almost reconcile one to Fine Writing .

London	LOCATION	,
March 15 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A YEAR 'S WORK OF OUR GREATEST PUBLIC LIBRARY , as reduced to figures and statistically exhibited on the opening page of Director
Edwin H. Anderson	PERSON	's `` Report of the
New York	LOCATION	Public Library for
1915	DATE	, '' is impres - sive .

		With a central building and forty-three branches engaged in supplying the literary needs of our largest city , the record of attend - ance , of books circulated , of books used in reference rooms and reading rooms , and of other like activities , must be of no insignifi - cant proportions .

		`` During the year
1915	DATE	, '' we read , `` there entered the Central Building of the Library 2,558,717 persons '' many of them `` repeaters , '' undoubtedly , and a great number mere sight-seers ; but there are still left hundreds of thousands who made written application for books , and probably other hundreds of thousands who consulted refer - ence works that required no written applica - tion .

		In plain figures , `` 827,664 readers in the Central Building called for books , '' and the volumes thus called for numbered 2,289 , - 436 .

		Meanwhile the branches were busily lending their books for home use , to the num - ber of 10,384,579 , an increase of more than 860,000 over the preceding year .

		`` At the end of
1915	DATE	there were 996,574 books and 312,853 pamphlets in the Reference Depart - ment -LRB- Central Building -RRB- , in all 1,309,427 pieces .

		There were 1,100,952 volumes in the
Circulation Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		The total number of pieces in the whole Library was , therefore , 2,410,379 .

		The number of employes at the close of the year was
1248	DATE	. ''

		It is safe to surmise that the office of Director of this vast system , any one of the branches being equal to an average city library , to say nothing of the magnitude of the central establishment , is no sinecure .

		`` FALLEN AT THE FRONT '' comes back , more or less tardily , the last sad word concerning many a young writer of promise who has dropped the pen for the sword or rifle and hastened to the defence of his country or , enlisting in the
Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	, has entered the trenches for the love of fair
France	LOCATION	with - out owing her the allegiance of a son .

		The `` Bulletin des Ecrivains , '' published monthly
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 319 in
Paris	LOCATION	and sent gratuitously to all writers in the French service , brings us the sad tidings of the death in battle , last
June	DATE	, of Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- neth Weeks , a
New England	LOCATION	volunteer in the Legion that has covered itself with glory and suffered losses amounting almost to extinc - tion .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	was in the
First Regiment	ORGANIZATION	, and in an attack somewhere north of
Arras	LOCATION	, on the seventeenth of
June	DATE	, he fell .

		When last seen , he was running forward , face to the foe .

		His obituary , by Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	, appears on the front page of the
February	DATE	'' Bulletin . ''

		with other similar tributes to writers who have given their lives for
France	LOCATION	.

		From Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	's notice we learn that
Ken	PERSON	- neth Weeks was born in
New England	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	, travelled much in
France	LOCATION	in his youth , and early conceived a warm affection for that country .

		His first book , significantly named `` La Victoire de Sedan , '' Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	speaks of as `` a little curtain-raiser , '' whether liter - ally or figuratively , and says it was full of fervent admiration for
France	LOCATION	.

		It was pub - lished when its author was but seventeen years old .

		In
1911	DATE	Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	took up his abode in
Paris	LOCATION	for the purpose of continuing his architectural studies already begun in
America	LOCATION	; but these he gradually dropped in favor of literature .

		In
1912	DATE	he issued a vol - ume of sketches and essays , but his most ambi - tious work , and also his last , `` Science .

		Senti - ments , and Senses , '' he was not destined to see in print , though it was going through the press when the war broke out .

		He was of an old and distinguished family , and his loss is widely mourned .

		* WHERE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BRINGS THE GREATEST RETURNS has for some time been recognized by the intelligent and fair-minded | observer to be the public library .

		No other j municipal department can compare with this in extent and value of service rendered and smallness of cost to the tax-payer .

		On this head the librarian of the
Mankato	LOCATION	-LRB-
Minn.	LOCATION	-RRB- I Public Library gives some striking facts and j figures in her current Report a document !

		that comes to us in typewritten form , perhaps i in further illustration of careful economy on ; the library 's part .


Mankato	LOCATION	library service cost last year not quite four and
one-third cents	MONEY	per capita , the public schools requiring in the same period an outlay of
$ 4.14	MONEY	per | capita , the fire department
$ 1.05	MONEY	, the police department
five cents	MONEY	and seven mills , and the public parks
five cents	MONEY	and nine mills .

		The two last-named departments make a good < showing in respect to moderate expenditure , i but the service of neither is comparable with that of the library in either quantity or qual - i ity .

		The spirit in which service is rendered by the library is well illustrated by the fact tersely entered in the Financial Report that the Sunday-afternoon attendance re - quired of somebody in order that the working class may enjoy the library privileges to which this portion of the citizens is entitled , is given without pay by the librarian and her assistants .

		For the entire year except two months in the
summer	DATE	the doors are opened three hours on
Sunday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		And for expert library service from a librarian and two assistants less than
two thousand dollars	MONEY	a year is expended .

		Surely , the satisfactions of the profession are not to be found in its tangible emoluments .

		HALF A CENTURY A DRAMATIC CRITIC , and still uttering in vigorous terms his opinions on affairs of the stage , Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	received on the fourteenth of this month a testimonial of regard and esteem at the Cen - tury Theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	, from members of the craft which he has made his lifelong study .

		The celebration was in anticipation of his entrance upon his eighty-first year , which will not take place until next
July	DATE	a season less convenient for such an observance than the present .

		Fifty-one years ago he became dramatic critic of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' a position held by him until seven years ago , or , rather , still held by him as critic emeritus , to borrow an academic term .

		His works in prose and verse form an imposing list , and the list is still lengthening .

		His stage remin - iscences of late years have revealed the wealth of his experience as a critical student of the acted drama and as the friend and confidant of eminent actors ; they also illustrate the retentiveness of his memory and the firmness of his adherence to the best traditions of the dramatic art .

		Little use and small esteem has he for the frivolities and innovations of the passing hour .

		All his friends and readers must wish him continued health and strength to finish the series of reminiscent volumes on actors and acting which he is now writing .

		THE GEOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF
FIC	ORGANIZATION	- TION , such as is attempted in theory by the
Dewey	LOCATION	decimal system , but is seldom carried out in practice , can never hope to attain scien - tific accuracy or to be of much use in library service .

		How , for example , would one geo - graphically classify the novels of
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	, of
Henry James	PERSON	, of
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	?

		The country of an author 's birth , breeding , and citizenship , that of his later residence , that to which his scenes and char - 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	acters belong , and that whose language he uses in writing , may all be different from one another , to the confusion of any attempted geographical classification .

		A somewhat simi - lar difficulty confronts one in endeavoring to name the distinctively national novel of sur - passing merit in any country 's literature .

		In the current issue of `` Branch Library News '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- the editor speaks to the point in discussing `` The Great American Novel , '' showing the absurdity of expecting any such impossible book to be produced .

		Even countries smaller and more nearly ho - mogeneous than ours , he says , have brought forth no similar creation of the novelist 's art ; how , then , can our broad land with its mul - tifarious and often mutually repellent ele - ments serve as fit soil for the germination and growth of anything worthy of being called the great American novel , as distinguished from all other American novels ?

		Still it must be admitted that some of the older coun - tries do have each its outstanding master - piece of prose fiction .

		``
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' `` I
Promessi Sposi	PERSON	, '' `` Les Miserables , '' `` Wil - helm
Meister	PERSON	, '' enjoy a repute , whether always deserved or not , that remains , on the whole , undisputed in each instance .

		But with us some half dozen or more novels jostle one another for preeminence in the sense indicated by the heading of Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's essay .

		And may it not be a piece of good fortune that no one `` great American novel '' is possible , since for that reason there is the more room for many great American novels ?

		THE OVERWORKED SUPERLATIVE has long been clamoring for better terms from its employers for less exhausting and unceas - ing demands upon its services , and for more generous recognition of its true value and of its dignity in the vocabulary of every-day speech and of printed prose and poetry .

		Never has the temptation to excess of vehemence been stronger than in these passionate times ; and never , therefore , has there been greater need of caution and restraint in both speech and writing .


Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's advice to young writers , to strike out their adjectives and adverbs and let their nouns and verbs do the fighting , is a counsel of perfection which his own printed page would show to be hardly practicable ; but it is possible , without loss of either strength or grace , to prune one 's sentences of their superlatives .

		Theoretically there is but one best or worst , largest or small - est , most beautiful or most hideous , object of any given kind ; and consequently the occa - sions demanding the use of the superlative are extremely rare , and the chances that in a whole book it will not once be needed are a thousand to one .

		And if this be so in regard to legitimate superlatives , what shall be said of those false superlatives , those absurd for - mations , like `` most unique , '' `` most singular , '' `` most perfect , '' `` most correct , '' `` most com - plete , '' and those less absurd but still illogical forms , `` most satisfactory , '' `` most adequate , '' `` most truthful , '' `` most convincing , '' and the like ?

		We squander our verbal wealth when we indulge in exaggerative or meaningless superlatives , and even the most careful of us need to be cautioned against heedlessness in this particular .

		We are all poor miserable sinners , in a linguistic if not also in a moral sense , and can not -LRB- to change the metaphor -RRB- afford to throw stones .

		It is not the intention here to cast even the tiniest -LRB- the superlative is here used advisedly -RRB- pebble , but rather to call attention to Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's little essay on `` The Abuse of the Superlative , '' in his latest book , `` Reticence in Literature . ''

		AN ANECDOTE ABOUT
CARMEN SYLVA	PERSON	, illus - trating the extent and variety of her literary accomplishments , is told by
Pierre Loti	PERSON	in the volume of sketches bearing her name as its chief title , .

		At the castle of
Sinaia	LOCATION	, where the French author seems to have been a welcome and favored guest , he had the pleasure of hearing the Roumanian Queen read both from her own writings and from those of others .

		After a brief reference to `` a heart-rending little tale , written with rare dramatic power , '' and read from one of her own books by
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	in a manner that thrilled the hearer with emotion , he describes her read - ing something else to her attendant maids of honor her `` daughters '' he called them , though her one and only child had long been dead .

		He continues : '' I was sufficiently close to Her Majesty to see the words of the book as she turned over the pages , and great was my surprise to discover that what she was reading in French was written in German .

		It would have been impossible to guess it , for there was not the slightest hesitation in her charming diction ; even the phrases she improvised were always harmonious ... On another occasion I heard her perform the same wonderful feat in translating from the Roumanian .

		She was reading aloud an old mountain ballad , transposing it right off into rhythmical , poetical French .

		It would appear as though it were a matter of indiffer - ence to her which language she used as the vehicle of her thoughts .

		In this respect she resembles those accomplished musicians who play a piece of music in any key with like facility and intensity of feeling . ''

		In the same
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 321 chapter he says : ''
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	, reading her own works , is the only person who ever stirred me , with fiction , to the point of making me weep ; perhaps this is the strongest praise of her talent that I can give , for even at the theatre , where men are so frequently moved to tears , I am never affected in the slightest degree . ''

		BOOKBINDERS * TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS in these days of unavoidable curtailment of supplies from abroad are exemplified in the following record of experience at the bindery attached to the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	of this city .

		Dr.
Carlton	PERSON	, the Librarian , writes in his cur - rent Report : '' Owing to conditions arising out of the Great War , we have been unable to replenish certain portions of our stock of leath - ers and cloth used in binding .

		Our stock of imported English imperial cloth is nearly exhausted in the red , maroon , and brown col - ors , and the manufacturers can not at present fill orders for the material in these colors .

		Consequently we are using a high-grade
Holliston	LOCATION	library buckram to match sets previ - ously bound in the imported cloth .

		The first quality morocco leather which we have been accustomed to import from
Germany	LOCATION	is of course no longer obtainable .

		Our stock of this maroon color is entirely exhausted and we are using cloth of a corresponding color in binding current volumes of sets previously bound in leather .

		We endeavored , but with - out success , to secure a
Turkey	LOCATION	morocco in the maroon color ; the other colors do not match our former stock . ''

		In other particulars , too , this annual record of notable library work reveals the injurious effect of the war ; but the substitution of honest buckram for other and perhaps less durable material ought not to furnish cause for unqualified regret .

		NUTSHELL CRITICISM , criticism carried to the extreme of pithy brevity , formed one of the diversions of the
Papeterie Club	ORGANIZATION	to which Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	belonged in later life , and of which she was the animating spirit .

		It was jocosely known as `` Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's Vaude - ville , '' and the system of literary criticism credited to its inventive genius one suspects to have been the offspring of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's clever brain .

		Here are some of the symbols used to commend or condemn the `` paper novels '' -LRB- whence the name of the club -RRB- read and passed around among the club mem - bers : `` B. P. By the pound ;
M. A. S. May	PERSON	amuse somebody ; P. B. Pot-boiler ;
F. W. B.	PERSON	For waste-basket ;
U. I. Uplifting	PERSON	in - fluence ; W. D. Wholly delightful ;
U. T. Utter	PERSON	trash . ''

		This is from Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's biog - raphy by her daughters , more formally dis - cussed on a later page .

		Of the same club and its `` delicious fooling , '' and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's part in that fooling , the book adds further details .

		`` Merrymaking was her safety-valve .

		Brain fag and nervous prostration were practically unknown to her .

		When she had worked to the point of exhaustion , she turned to play .

		Fun and frolic went along with labor and prayer ; the power of combining these kept her steadily at her task till the end of her life .

		The last time she left her house , six days before hep death , it was to preside at the
Papeterie	LOCATION	, where she was as usual the life of the meeting !

		The club still lives , and , like the
New England Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, seems still pervaded by her spirit . ''

		In no man or woman of genius has the imperishable child , with all its frank and free fun and playfulness , more delightfully or more lastingly shown itself than in this ever-youthful woman .

		A PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH A DISTINCTIVE NAME something less common than the
Smithville Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, or the
Tompkins Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Jonesborough	LOCATION	, or the
Carnegie Library of Johnson Centre	ORGANIZATION	, or even the
Littlefield Athenasum	PERSON	is a rarity that commends itself if only by reason of its unusu - alness .

		Such an institution has recently opened its doors on Niagara Street in
Buffalo	LOCATION	.

		It is called the
Jubilee Library	ORGANIZATION	, surely a name of glad omen .

		It is a branch of the city 's main library , but seems to be a completely equipped establishment in itself .

		From the
Buffalo	LOCATION	librarian 's Nineteenth Annual Report we learn that `` the Jubilee
spring	DATE	on
Delaware Avenue	LOCATION	was for many years the water supply of the village of
Black Rock	ORGANIZATION	, now a part of the city of
Buffalo	LOCATION	, and was used more or less by the residents of that section -LRB- known as the
Parrish Tract	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- until the service was ordered discontinued in the year
1898	DATE	.

		A bill was passed by the
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	in that year which provided for the sale of the property of the Jubilee Water Works , and for the erec - tion of a branch library building .

		In
1912	DATE	this bill was amended to provide for a build - ing which could be used for other purposes , in addition to the Library . ''

		It was built under the direction of the
Jubilee Water Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	, has an auditorium in the base - ment , a gymnasium in an annex , and devotes its main floor to library purposes .

		It is a community centre , stands in a thickly-settled district , serves a considerable Polish and Hun - garian population , maintains a collection of Polish and one of Hungarian books , has an assistant who speaks the language of
Kosci	LOCATION	- 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	uszko , and doubtless lives up to its name by spreading gladness among its patrons , old and young .

		A HOPEFUL VIEW OP THE BOOK BUSINESS , of its fortunes after the war , and of the general attitude toward literature in this country , is taken by one of our oldest and best-informed publishers , Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, in a thoughtful article contributed by request to `` The
New York	LOCATION	Times Review of Books . ''

		An improvement in the American book trade he already sees as compared with conditions in
1914	DATE	and the
first half of 1915	DATE	, and this recuperation he thinks will continue , with a drawing together , in mutual understanding and in literary sympathies , of the three great democratic nations of the earth as soon as the present absorption in warfare shall have given place to revived interest in the pursuits of peace .


England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will find themselves cherishing ideals and aims in common and producing works of literature that will appeal to readers in all three countries .

		Nearer , too , shall we be drawn in our sympathies to the Latin-Ameri - can republics , he prophesies , and this also will have a stimulating effect on our literature and on theirs .

		In fact , it is a note of optimism , intelligent optimism , that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	strikes in his well-informed utterance on the literary outlook .

		NAUSEATING PRESCRIPTIONS are not the monopoly of those who administer pills and powders , ipecac and rhubarb , cod-liver oil and sulphur and molasses .

		Prescribed read - ing has a way of exciting distaste on the part of the intended reader , whereas a forbidden book possesses a charm beyond the power of words to express .

		`` Greater diplomacy is needed in presenting a literary masterpiece acceptably to children of high-school age , '' wisely observed Miss
Alice M. Jordan	PERSON	, of the children 's department of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, at a late meeting of the
Massachusetts Library Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Bearing with them the list of outside reading prepared by the school to stimulate their reading habits and develop their tastes , these boys and girls say to you : ' I want one book to read for school and one good book for myself . '

		Propose to them to look at the reading list and they reply : ` If it 's good , it is n't on the list . '

		We are still in the place where literature and interesting books are far asunder in the minds of many young people .

		One principal tells us that his ' experience proves that lists do not encourage reading . '

		In his school , a large technical school , they have ceased to use reading lists for this reason . ''

		As with growing children who so often clamor the loudest for the food they have been forbidden to eat , so with young readers a little innocent wile has more than once been found effective in whetting the appetite for wholesome diet .

		But rules to this end are as futile as all cut-and-dried instructions for winning the confidence and affection of young people .

		Personal influence alone can achieve the desired result .

		PREPARATION -LRB- NOT `` PREPAREDNESS '' -RRB- FOR
1919	DATE	, a centennial year not incomparable , in the literary world , with the wonderful year
1909	DATE	, may perhaps with profit be preached even thus early .

		At any rate , it may be worth while to glance down the list of great names , and of some less great , that will be conspic - uous in public print three years from now , especially as it is our own country that fur - nishes the greater number of these illustrious names .

		Since the order of greatness in which they should be mentioned is open to dispute , let us follow the order of their birthdays , thus :
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Feb. 8	DATE	;
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Feb. 22	DATE	;
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	,
May 27	DATE	;
Walt Whitman	PERSON	,
May 31	DATE	;
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Nov. 22	DATE	.

		Among the minor literary celebrities born in
1819	DATE	are found the following , which are here named with no attempt at chronological or any other order :
Clough	PERSON	,
Kingsley	PERSON	,
E. P. Whipple	PERSON	,
J. G. Hol	PERSON	- land ,
Herman Melville	PERSON	,
Susan Warner	PERSON	,
W. W. Story	PERSON	,
Gottfried Keller	PERSON	,
Theodore Fontane	PERSON	, and
Wilhelm Jordan	PERSON	.

		These for the present will be enough for us to read up in anticipa - tion of the day when we shall be glad and proud to be able to talk fluently and intelli - gently about them and their works .

		Already the centenary biography of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	a complete , authoritative , and remarkably inter - esting account of her life , by her daughters , Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	and Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	has ap - peared , and is reviewed elsewhere in this issue .

		AN AVERTED PAPER-FAMINE must be the heading to this paragraph , which itself will serve as a sequel to the recent announcement in these columns of a threatened shortage in
England	LOCATION	of the indispensable raw material of books , magazines , and newspapers .

		The British government seems -LRB- or seem , as our English cousins prefer to say , not liking to think of the ruling power as a mere unit , an insignificant singular number -RRB- the British government seem to have repented themselves of their purpose to bar out importations of wood-pulp and other paper-making material for the sake of cutting down the tonnage of imports in these days of hazardous seafar -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 323 ing .

		At any rate , word now comes that the scare among paper-makers , printers , publish - ers , and -LRB- to some extent -RRB- authors , has passed like a fleeting cloud on a
summer	DATE	day ; for the prohibition is to be but partial , one-third of the usual tonnage , the other two-thirds being admitted , and this is held to be quite enough in a season of restricted activity among the users of paper .

		The preponderance of influ - ential sentiment against the threatened meas - ure , in its full severity , has evidently pro- duced an effect .

		But the sad fact still remains ' that paper and all the materials that go to its making and finishing and to the produc - tion of printed matter generally are abnor - mally scarce and consequently high in price i throughout a great part of the civilized world , our own country not excepted .

		A DAY AT THE TELEPHONE OF A MUNICIPAL REFERENCE LIBRARY in a city of considerable size is likely to subject the listener to a string ' of questions as varied and bewildering as | those embalmed in the sprightly and amusing verses that have gone the round of the library publications and some other periodicals , with ' and without acknowledgment to the author , Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	.

		At the
Munici	PERSON	- pal Reference Library of
New York City	LOCATION	some of these questions by telephone in a single day were as follows : Do you know of any publication entitled ``
New York City	LOCATION	'' ?

		What is the best book on hospital construction ?

		Who are the new members of the
Board of Aldermen	ORGANIZATION	?

		How many miles of paved and unpaved streets are there in
New York City	LOCATION	?

		i What can you tell me about the
Chapin	PERSON	Home for the Aged and Infirm ?

		What is the busi - ness address of Justice
Samuel Greenbaum	PERSON	?

		, In order to secure a marriage license does one ; need to take a birth certificate to the
Marriage License Bureau	ORGANIZATION	f When is the next civil serv - ice examination for stenographer to be held , i and what speed is required ?

		These and other miscellaneous inquiries are printed in the cur - rent Report of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, a fat pamphlet of 118 variously interesting and instructive pages .

		ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT , broad acres of it , still remains is our answer to the follow ing from `` The Pyoneer ov Simplifyd Spel - ing '' : `` The seupreem test ov eni sistem ov simplifyd speling iz its reedabiliti at syt .

		The chain jez ov speling reesentli adopted in THE PYONEER hav imensli inkreest its reedabelnes in komparison with that in eus sum thre yeerz ago .

		Kompair the foloing egzampelz . ' '

		These include such forms as `` tauc , tank ; wauc .

		wauk ; fliing , flying ; endyuer , endeur , licwid , likwid ; cil , Ml , salyut , saleut , '' and twice as many more , which do seem to show , on the whole , a move in the right direction .

		THE HOMERIC HYMN TO THE GOD OF BATTLES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The latest volume issued in the `` Loeb Classical Library , '' that series whose sponsor is placing the literary world so irredeemably in his debt , is that devoted to `` Hesiod , the Homeric Hymns and
Homerica	ORGANIZATION	, '' and contains , in conformance with the previous volumes of the Library , the original texts , with parallel translations , the latter by
Hugh G. Evelyn	PERSON	- White ,
M.A.	LOCATION	, sometime scholar of
Wadham College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		I leave the task of adequate appreciation of the manner in which the translator has acquitted himself to your reviewer , but wish to call attention to the following transcript of his version of the Eighth of the Homeric Hymns , as follows : To ARES .

		ARES , exceeding in strength , chariot-rider , golden - helmed , doughty in heart , shield-bearer , Saviour of cities , harnessed in bronze , strong of arm , unwearying , mighty with the spear , O defence of
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, father of warlike Victory , ally of Themis , stern governor of the rebellious , leader of righteous men , sceptered King of manliness , who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven ; hear me , helper of men , giver of dauntless youth !

		Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life , and strength of war , that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul .

		Restrain also the keen fury of my heart , which provokes me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife .

		Rather , O blessed one , give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace , avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death .

		As to the literary beauty of this version , there can be no argument , nor as to its fidelity to the original .

		But that of which I wish to speak is the beautiful spirit which it breathes .

		There are many passages in the Greek writers in which Ares is depicted as careering wildly over the field of battle , rioting in slaughter and drenched with gore .

		In the `` Iliad '' itself he is exhibited in the light of a barbarouslv cruel divinitv .

		But in this Hvmn 324 -LSB-
March 30	DATE	what a different conception is presented and it is worth while to remember that it is the only one to Ares among the thirty-three different invo - cations of the gods in the Homeric catalogue .

		As we know , the Homeric Hvmns were not written by the author of the `` Iliad . ''

		That they are of later date seems certain .

		The Ares of the `` Iliad '' we may regard as the conception of a popular minstrel , who , in his depiction , was presenting a figure calculated to dovetail into his epic scheme .

		On the contrary , the Ares of the Hymn is , unmis - takably , a religious conception , and it a strik - ing fact , pointed out by Mr.
Evelyn-White	PERSON	in his Introduction , that of the entire corpus of thirty - three Homeric hymns , that to Ares is the only one which can be regarded as truly devotional or litur - gical .

		Greek scholarship concludes that the others were composed for recitation at religious cere - monies by rhapsodes , etc. .

		At this juncture , when the world 's greatest war is dragging its slow length toward its third year , and all the great powers of
Europe	LOCATION	are arrayed against each other , sacrificing million after million of their most priceless manhood in an insensate struggle , their clergies are invoking the Christian God , to whom they one and all at least hypo - thetically bow down , with prayers and adjurations , how different from that addressed to this pagan war-god of an era antedating the birth of Christ by many centuries !

		They pray for the success of their arms , for the power to so successfully prosecute the slaughter in which they are engaged that their enemies may be brought defenceless into the dust before them .

		For greater strength to slay is their constant prayer .

		But what asks the pagan of his battle-deity ?

		`` Strength of war '' he supplicates , but for this purpose `` that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul . ''

		Not for fury with which to prosecute the task of blood-shed , but for force to `` Restrain .

		.

		the keen fury of my heart , which provokes me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife .

		Rather , blessed one , give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace , avoiding strife and hatred . ''

		What a lesson in humanism !

		What a rebuke , to a supposedly civilized and Christianized world , from a supposedly semi-barbarous and pagan one !

		What a powerful presentation of the truth that from the most ancient of the classics , , which modernity so scornfully flouts , we may derive concepts and precepts of a nobility which moder - nity , apparently , knows no more .

		`` AN ALMOST FOEGOTTEN ENGLISH WRITER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB- ''

		Good wine needs no bush , '' but when a recent volume of '' Everyman 's Library '' was mentioned as being `` by
Juliana Horatia Ewing	PERSON	, an almost forgotten English writer of fiction , '' we gazed incredulously at one another across '' The
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript . ''

		We knew we were inconspicuous people whose literary loves did not count ; but we took heart , remembering that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, whose literary judgments are a deal steadier than his politics , had set the mark of his approval on '' Six to Sixteen . ''

		And anyhow , it is always a pleasure to give testimony in favor of an old friend .

		Shall we ever see rose-colored tulips without thinking of
John Broom	ORGANIZATION	's progress down the long walk , or the yellow
May	DATE	marshes without a fellow feeling for Timothy ?

		-LRB- For kingcups shine as bright in our
New England	LOCATION	meadows under the name of cowslips , or marsh marigolds , as in a
Yorkshire	LOCATION	bog . -RRB-

		And how often have we checked one another in the pleasant occupation of castle - building with the comment of the Weeding Woman , '' It do n't become ` ee to forecast au - tumns . ''

		Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	is always classed as a writer for children .

		To be sure , most children are said to care little for her .

		It is hardly likely that a young - ster who has been fed with the works of Miss
Nina Rhodes	PERSON	, for example , would find any interest in an author who never talks down to her small audience .

		Yet
Hans Andersen	PERSON	might be proud to claim ''
Timothy	PERSON	's Shoes , '' `` Amelia and the Dwarfs , '' and that whimsically pathetic '' Land of Lost Toys '' ; while '' Benjy in
Beastland	LOCATION	'' stands hardly second to '' Black Beauty '' as a plea for kindness to animals .

		If Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	does not always escape the charge of too often pointing a moral , it can be said that , like her `` Aunt
Penelope	PERSON	, '' she wraps it like a Christmas motto in plenty of bright paper .

		She entirely avoids another pitfall which our own
Miss Alcott	LOCATION	, with all her humor and common sense , does not escape : Mrs. Swing 's young folks are too busy with their lessons , their dogs , their gar - dens , and their sketches to bother their heads over precocious love affairs .

		And what nice young people most of them are !

		Cattishness , super-piety , a tendency to advise their elders , are at a discount .

		In ''
Mary	PERSON	's Meadow '' the little heroine takes her mother 's place , and carries a difficult task to a triumphal end ; but the girl never seems disagreeably virtuous , in spite of the story being told in the first person .

		This bookish , flower-loving
Mary	PERSON	, the Arkwrights , Jan the descendant of Dutch painters , these are a few that come to mind ; but best of all is large - headed , notional
Chris	PERSON	, a veritable masterpiece of child portraiture .

		And when Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	wrote his essay on '' Dogs and Men '' why did he not mention Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	among the writers who knew dogs ?

		We beg him to begin at once and make the acquaintance of
Saxon	LOCATION	and
Rubens	PERSON	and the rest .

		Yet when all is said , the very best of her work falls into the class which includes '' The Golden Age '' and our own '' Little
Jane	PERSON	and Me , '' books about rather than for children .

		There is no earthly reason why at least two of her stories , ``
Daddy Darwin	PERSON	's Dovecot '' and `` Lob-lie-by-the - Fire , '' should not take their place among the little masterpieces of English .

		For Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	is a master of English style .

		Read the description of the midsummer evening in `` Lob-lie-by-the-Fire . ''

		Read the opening pages of `` Daddy
Darwin	PERSON	's Dovecot , '' or the passage
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 325 where
Jack Marsh	PERSON	listens to the choir , - and you will find an effortless perfection which makes this woman the little sister of the great writers of English .

		Perhaps the contempt for '' south of
England	LOCATION	'' `` softness '' which Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	attributes to one of her characters was part of the nature whose sympathies seem to have turned to the country of
Jean Eliot	PERSON	and Lady
Nairn	PERSON	.

		Certainly , '' soft '' she never is .

		Pathos she has in plenty , but her shrewd common sense , her humor , and her reti - cence keep her from sentimentality .

		The treat - ment of a death scene is a fair test of an author 's freedom from mawkishness .

		In the dying of Mc -
Alister	PERSON	, Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	has written one such scene which comes nearer than most to the chapter in which
Colonel Newcome	ORGANIZATION	says `` Adsum . ''

		Two little English books given long ago are among our most cherished possessions .

		They are thin , card-bound little books , ''
Daddy Darwin	PERSON	'' and '' Lob , '' and '' Mary 's Meadow . ''

		Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	had the good fortune to find a most sympathetic illustrator for '' Jackanapes '' and the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	tales in
Kandolph Caldecott	LOCATION	.

		Who could have bet - tered such sketches as that of the baby John presenting the tulips to
Miss Betty	LOCATION	, or that of the nankeen rears of Jackanapes and Tony as they indulged in their first dissipation ?

		But in the col - lected edition the picture for `` Lob-lie-by-the - Fire '' is by
Cruikshank	PERSON	, and never was a more unfortunate choice .

		Those loose-lipped squat women , who have stepped out of one of the artist 's comic almanacs , are no more like her little ladies '' than I to Hercules . ''

		Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	never wrote a novel .

		Probably she was not master of the variety which could people a large stage .

		Though she had an innate sense of form , plot must always have been a secondary matter to her .

		No doubt she wrote her north country stories just for the sake of drawing the landscape and characters she loved .

		When her little tales were told , she left them with no desire for a larger canvass .

		Perhaps , because like her peasant she was '' no ways presuming , '' her work will outlive manj ' more ambitious productions .

1916	DATE	AND

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The approaching Shakespeare tercentenary celebration by our branch of the English-speaking race , to whom must fall the large share of the commemoration on account of
England	LOCATION	's pre - occupation with war , suggests the reversed circum - stances of these two great nations in
1864	DATE	, on the occasion of the tercentenary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		Then it was
America	LOCATION	that was embroiled in war , while
England	LOCATION	was free to celebrate the victories of peace , not the least renowned of which was the production of her greatest genius .

		In a tribute from
America	LOCATION	to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	offered on that occasion ,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	answers
England	LOCATION	's challenge to the share of ` warring aliens '' in `` her holy task '' of keeping ` her two-fold Saint 's - day '' : O land of Shakespeare !

		ours with all thy past , Till these last years that make the sea so wide , Think not the jar of battle 's trumpet-blast Has dulled our aching sense to joyous pride In every noble word thy sons bequeathed The air our fathers breathed !

		War-wasted , haggard , panting from the strife , We turn to other days and far-off lands , Live o'er in dreams the poet 's faded life , * Come with fresh lilies in our fevered hands To wreath his bust , and scatter purple flowers , Not his the need , but ours !

		In this dread hour of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's utmost need , Thanks for these unstained drops of freshening dew !

		O , while our martyrs fall , our heroes bleed , Keep us to every sweet remembrance true , Till from this blood-red sunset springs new-born Our Nation 's second morn !

		Now that the tables are turned , so that it is
England	LOCATION	and not
America	LOCATION	that must answer the challenge , this recognition by a war-convulsed nation of the need of the master-mind of a Shakespeare seems as appropriate for
England	LOCATION	now as it was for
America	LOCATION	then .

		ONE READER 'S REACTIONS TO `` SPOON RIVER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		For perhaps the tenth time I have just closed that orgie of verse-prose , the `` Spoon River Anthology . ''

		The first reading was the horrible experience of a nightmare .

		I rubbed my bewil - dered eyes , and asked the four walls of my stud -RCB- ' , `` Is this poetry ? ''

		After the second reading I firmly concluded , `` No , this is not poetry , nor is it prose ; but it is life . ''

		Last night I was certain that `` Spoon River is not life , it is death . ''

		To - morrow I shall reread parts of the book , and I may not know whether it is life or death .

		But this I do know : Great poetry must not merely reflect life , it must breath the air of a high idealism .

		It must present life truly , but wholesomely .

		This work does not satisfy the demands of the poetic nature .

		It is too earthy .

		It creeps like a reptile through slime and evil .

		We can not turn to the pages of this book and become inspired by that `` high seriousness '' that dignifies the masters of verse , nor find the whole - some tone that graces the work of .

		those who sit on the mid-slopes of
Parnassus	LOCATION	.

		Rather , we are depressed ; our imagination is destroyed , and we close the book with a disgust for its vulgarity .

		Nevertheless , there is life in this book , say what we will .

		It contains none of the `` noble and pro- found application of ideas to life , '' rather , a description of life as naked and analytic as we might find between the covers of a work on sexual psychology .

March 30	DATE	A MAXY-GIFTED WOMAN .

		* In closing her `` Reminiscences '' of eighty years , Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	very modestly acknowledged what she called her failures , and with equal modesty summed up what she regarded as her chief successes .

		`` It was a great distinction for me , '' she noted first of all , `` when the foremost philanthropist of the age chose me for his wife .

		It was a great success for me when , having been born and bred in
New York City	LOCATION	, I found myself able to enter into the intellectual life of
Boston	LOCATION	, and to appreciate the ` high thinking ' of its choice spirits .

		I have sat at the feet of the masters of literature , art , and science , and have been graciously admitted into their fel - lowship .

		I have been chosen poet of several high festivals , to wit , the celebration of
Bryant	PERSON	's seventieth birthday , the commemora - tion of the centenary of his birth , and the unveiling of the statue of
Columbus	LOCATION	in Cen - tral Park ,
New York	LOCATION	, in the Columbian year , so called .

		I have been the founder of a club of young girls , which has exercised a salutary influence upon the growing womanhood of my adopted city , and has won for itself an honor - able place in the community , serving also as a model for similar associations in other cities .

		I have been for many years the president of the
New England Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, and of the Association for the
Advancement of Women	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have been heard at the great Prison Con - gress in
England	LOCATION	, at Mrs.
Butler	PERSON	's convention de moralite publique in
Geneva	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and at more than one convention in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		I have been welcomed in
Faneuil Hall	LOCATION	, when I have stood there to rehearse the merits of public men , and later to plead the cause of oppressed
Greece	LOCATION	and murdered
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		I have written one poem which , although com - posed in the stress and strain of the civil war , is now sung
South and North	ORGANIZATION	by the cham - pions of a free government .

		I have been accounted worthy to listen and to speak at the
Boston Radical Club	ORGANIZATION	and at the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have been exalted to occupy the pulpit of my dear church and that of others , without regard to denominational limits .

		to do so was a thankless office , involving public ridicule and private avoidance . ''

		To this impressive list of achievements she might have added others hardly less memor - able .

		She spoke with fluency and correctness , four or five modern languages , and had a scholar 's acquaintance with Greek and Latin .

		She was successful , even brilliant , in many forms of literary composition , and if she had been contented to confine her abundant ener - gies to poetry or fiction or the drama she might have made her name still more illus - trious than it is in American literature .

		In music , both instrumental and vocal , she early developed talents that won for her high praise from those whose praise was more than empty flattery .

		And , not least of all , her beauty and grace and charm marked her from the first as one destined to shine in society and to impress by her endowments of person as well as by her gifts of mind and heart .

		Such was the woman whose `` complete and authoritative and intensely interesting biography , '' as the publishers announce with - out overstepping the bounds of truth , is now offered to the reading public by her three sur - viving daughters .

		Its two volumes of about four hundred pages each are largely made up of extracts from Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's letters and diaries , so that the total effect is almost that of an autobiography , and the years surveyed in the `` Reminiscences '' are here , with much greater detail , many variations of emphasis , additions having to do with the last decade of her life , and not a little that could hardly be admitted by Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	into her own story of herself , again passed in review .

		In a manner not fully .

		illustrated in the earlier work the precocity , one might almost say the ominously alarming precocity , of the child
Julia	PERSON	is made evident by her faithful biog - raphers .

		From the solemn priggishness of an early letter to her cousin
Henry Ward	ORGANIZATION	she happily recovered in good season .

		In that letter , written at eight years of age , she had said : `` I hear with regret that you are sick , and it is as necessary as ever that you should trust in God ; love Him , dear
Henry	PERSON	, and you will see Death approaching with joy .

		Oh , what are earthly things , which we must all lose when we die to our immortal souls which never die ! ''

		A manuscript volume of original verse dedicated to her father by the twelve - year-old poet has been preserved .

		This is the dedication : To
Samuel Ward	PERSON	.

		Beloved father , expect not to find in these juvenile productions the delicacy and grace which pervaded the writings of that dear parent who is now in glory .

		I am indeed conscious of the many faults they contain , but my object in presenting you with these -LRB- original -RRB- poems , has been
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 327 to give you a little memorial of my early life , and I entreat you to remember that they were written in the eleventh , twelfth , and thirteenth years of my life .

		Your loving daughter
Julia	PERSON	.

		What merriment in after years must have been aroused in Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	by the remem - brance of that exhortation to her cousin -LRB- who had a good half-century of life before him -RRB- to view with joy the approach of Death , and how she must have relished the intense serious - ness of her dedicatory letter to her father !

		Not in every respect was the child the mother of the woman in her case .

		A keener sense of humor was seldom shown by man or woman , a greater freedom from pose and from the tendency to take oneself too seriously , than by this same
Julia Ward	PERSON	of maturer years .

		The traditional theology of such childish effusions as her solemn entreaty to her cousin
Henry	ORGANIZATION	fell away and gave place to a reasoned faith of quite another complexion .

		Her father , whom she fairly idolized , but who kept her under rather severe restraint at home , died when she was twenty-one , and thenceforth she was free to expand and develop as the wholesome promptings of her nature dictated .

		Brothers and sisters , cousins and uncles and aunts , with other relatives and friends innumerable , formed no unimportant part of her environment ; masters of music and dancing and the languages contributed to the training and developing of her natural apti - tudes ; and the pleasures of society , indulged in with moderation and discrimination , were a further factor in ripening her powers .

		Long - fellow ,
Sumner	ORGANIZATION	,
Hillard	PERSON	,
Horace Mann	PERSON	, Mar - garet Fuller ,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and others of note , were her friends , in some instances her close friends .

		With
Dickens	PERSON	she became acquainted even before her wedding journey took her to
London	LOCATION	and introduced her to the best Eng - lish society .

		A significant reference to `` Boz '' occurs in a
Boston	LOCATION	letter of hers , written to her sisters in
1842	DATE	.

		She says : Last night I went to a party at
Miss Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's , given to
Boz	PERSON	and me , at least , I was invited before he came here , so think that I will only give him an equal share of the honor .

		I danced a good deal with some very agreeable partners , and talked with
Summer	DATE	,
Hillard	PERSON	,
Longo	PERSON	-LSB-
Longfellow	PERSON	-RSB- , etc. .

		I was quite pleased that
Boz	PERSON	recognized
Fanny Appleton	PERSON	and myself , and gave us a smile and bow en passant .

		He could do no more , being almost torn to pieces by the crowd which throngs his footsteps , wherever he goes .

		I like to look at him , he has a bright and most speaking countenance , and his face is all wrinkled with the lines , not of care , but of laughter .

		His manners are very free and cordial , and he seems to be as capital a fellow as one would suppose from his writings .

		He circulates as universally as small change , and he understands the art of gratifying others without troubling himself , of letting himself be seen without displaying himself now this speaks for his real good taste , and shows that if not a gentleman born and bred , he is at least a man , every inch of him .

		From those early visits to
Boston	LOCATION	dates her spiritual growth , we are told ; for those visits were not `` given wholly to gayety , even in the days when she wrote , after a ball : ' I have been through the burning , fiery furnace , and it is Sad-rake , Me-sick , and Abed-no-go ! '

		The friends she made , both men and women , were people alive and awake , seeking new light , and finding it on every hand . ''

		It was in
Boston	LOCATION	, naturally , that she first met Dr.
Howe	PERSON	, and , as her biography adds , `` at her side was now one of the torch-bearers of humanity , a spirit burning with a clear flame of fervor and resolve , lighting the dark places of the earth .

		Her mind , under the stimulus of these influences , opened like a flower ; she too became one of the seekers for light , and in her turn one of the light-bringers . ''

		In this connection her first meeting with
Emerson	PERSON	must be related in the words of the book : On every hand she met people , who like herself were pressing forward , seeking new light .

		She heard Channing preach , heard him say that God loves bad men as well as good ; another window opened in her soul .

		Again , on a journey to
Boston	LOCATION	, she met
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	.

		The train being delayed at a way - side station , she saw the Transcendentalist , whom she had pictured as hardly human , carrying on his shoulder the child of a poor and weary woman ; her heart warmed to him , and they soon made acquaint - ance .

		She , with the ardor of youth , gave him at some length the religious views which she still held in the main , and with which she felt he would not agree .

		She enlarged upon the personal presence of Satan on this earth , on his power over man .

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	replied with gentle courtesy , '' Surely the Angel must be stronger than the Demon ! ''

		She never forgot these words ; another window opened , and a wide one .

		Illustrating the buoyancy and optimism that seemed to grow in strength with Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	as she advanced in years , this little anecdote is told of her by her daughters : Our mother was once present at a meeting where there was talk of ancestry and heredity .

		One of the speakers dwelt largely upon the sins of the fathers .

		He drew stern pictures of the vice , the barbarism , the heathenism of the `` good old times , '' and ended by saying with emphasis that he felt himself , `` bowed down beneath the burden of the sins of his ancestors . ''

		Our mother was on her feet in a flash .

		`` Mr. So-and-So , '' she said , `` is bowed down by the sins of his ancestors .

		I wish to say that all my life I have been buoyed up and lifted on by the remembrance of the virtues of mine ! ''

		Fortunate in her birth , happy in her mar - riage , blessed in her children , Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	is now once more smiled upon by fortune in having as her biographers daughters so accomplished and in every way so fitted for the work as Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	, Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Hall	PERSON	.


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		328 THE DIAL ANNALS OF A FAMOUS INDIAN TRIBE .

		* No one is better qualified to write of the American Indians than Mr.
George Bird Grinnell	PERSON	.

		He has known many tribes inti - mately through the years .

		His '' Blackfoot Lodge Tales '' and his `` Pawnee Hero-Stories and Folk-Tales '' are standard contributions to the best ethnological literature that Amer - ica has produced ; his '' Indians of Today '' is one of the best popular presentations ever given of our aborigines .

		In '' The Fighting Cheyennes , '' he makes a serious contribution to Indian history .

		Few realize that under the name American Indian great diversity exists .

		There are pro- digious differences in character and tempera - ment between different tribes .

		There are tribes that are noble , brave , progressive ; there are others that are ignoble , cowardly , stag - nant .

		Among the finest of our Plains tribes were the Cheyennes .

		They were rather sharply divided into
Northern and Southern Cheyennes	ORGANIZATION	; and while Mr.
Grinnell	PERSON	deals with both , his book is mainly the story of the northern branch .

		They are here considered specifically as fighters .

		They were actually among the bravest and most fearless of war - ring Indians .

		The story of their fighting is traced from the old days of their natural life down to their final battles of little more than twenty-five years ago .

		The story is told from the Indian standpoint , and as received from the mouths of the Indians themselves par - ticipants and witnesses of the events .

		The story covers three well marked phases or periods : that of inter-tribal wars with Indian enemies neighbors , rivals , trespas - sers on the buffalo-range ; that of the strug - gle against white encroachment against set - tlers , path-finders , and soldiers of the
United States	LOCATION	; that of the fighting for us and with us , as scouts during the time when we were trying to bring about quiet and security in the northwest .

		Mr.
Grinnell	PERSON	says : '' The old time Cheyennes possessed in high degree the savage virtues of honesty , trustworthiness , and bravery in the men , and of courage , devo - tion , and chastity in the women .

		Of the older people who took part in the fighting with the white troops some are still living and to-day are the only sources of original information concerning the former ways of the wild Chey - ennes , the old free life of the Western plains . ''

		In his book , he first presents a sketch of '' the ways of warriors '' by a few selected cases .

		During their first fighting days , as we know them , their enemies were the Crows ,

		and Comanches ; with the two last tribes they ultimately formed peace , and the three peoples in their later war history were often fighting side by side as friends ; the Arapahoes were usually their friends ; the
Sioux	LOCATION	, in their later wars , were often with them , but were not always reliable or helpful allies ; through practically the whole history of their contact , the Pawnees were their foes , and during their wars with American white troops the Pawnee scouts who accompanied and aided our sol - diers showed themselves implacable enemies .

		To the war contact between ourselves and the Cheyennes , Mr.
Grinnell	PERSON	devotes the major part , of his book .

		Dealings with whites , some - times friendly , sometimes not , extended over the period from
1832	DATE	, when
Gantt	PERSON	carried whiskey to them , up to the council of
1856	DATE	at
Fort Pierre	LOCATION	, when Colonel Harney recom - mended that an expedition should be sent against them .

		The first real collision came in the
summer	DATE	campaign of
1857	DATE	.

		From that time on until
1879	DATE	battles took place fre - quently between
United States	ORGANIZATION	soldiers and Cheyennes .

		Most of these engagements were inglorious affairs for us , although generally victory was ours .

		Most of these troubles might have been avoided : many of them were due to our aggressions ; some of them were acts of flagrant injustice on our part .

		The Indians were usually fighting in legitimate defence of their rights , natural or guaranteed .

		The story is an interesting , though often a sad one .

		Such an event as the
Sand Creek Massacre	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1864 -RRB- is a lasting disgrace to any people .

		The most interesting chapters in the book are undoubtedly those entitled `` Little Wolf and Dull Knife , 1876-1879 '' and '' The Fort Robinson Outbreak ,
1879	DATE	. ''

		A remnant of the Cheyennes had been sent south to the Indian Territory .

		They had come from the high dry country of
Montana	LOCATION	and
North Dakota	LOCATION	to the hot and humid Indian Territory .

		They had come from a country where buffalo and other game were still plenty to a country where the game had been exterminated .

		Immediately on their arrival they were attacked by fever and ague , a disease wholly new to them .

		Food was scanty and they began to starve ... The Indians endured this for about a year , and then their patience gave out .

		They left the agency to which they had been sent and started north .

		Though troops were camped close to them , they attempted no con - cealment of their purpose .

		Instead , they announced that they intended to return to their own country .

		We have heard much in past years of the
Nez Perces	LOCATION	' march under Chief
Joseph	PERSON	, but little is remembered of the Dull Knife outbreak , and the march to the north , led by Little
Wolf	PERSON	.

		This march was over an open country , where there was no oppor - tunity to avoid pursuers or to hide from them so as to get a little rest and respite .

		The story of the journey has not been told ; but in the traditions of the old army this campaign was notable , and men
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 who were stationed on the plains forty years ago are likely to tell you if you ask them that there never was such another journey since the Greeks marched to the sea .

		Troops sent after them from
Fort Keno	LOCATION	overtook the little band before it had gone a hundred miles .

		The Indians were ordered to return to the agency .

		They refused to do so , and a fight took place .

		The troops left them , and the Indians went on .

		The fugitives pressed constantly northward , while orders were flying over the wires and special trains were carrying men and horses , cavalry and infantry , to cut them off at all probable points on the different railway lines they must cross .

		Of the three hundred Indians , sixty or seventy were fighting men .

		The rest were old men , children , women and boys .

		An army officer once told me that thirteen thousand troops were hurrying over the country to capture or kill these few people who had left the fever-stricken south , and in the face of every obstacle were steadily marching northward .

		The War Department set in operation against them all its resources , but they kept on .

		If troops attacked them , they stopped and fought until they had driven off the soldiers , and then started north again .

		Sometimes they did not even stop , but marched along , fighting as they marched .

		For the most part they tried and with success to avoid conflicts and had but four real hard fights , in which they lost half a dozen men killed , and about as many wounded .

		Mr.
Grinnell	PERSON	gives the full details of this remarkable affair .

		The fugitives reached the north and divided into two bands .

		Nothing could be more different than the fates these met .

		Little
Wolf	PERSON	and his people chanced to have to deal with Lieutenant
W. P. Clark	PERSON	and
General Miles	ORGANIZATION	, men of heart and men of brain , and were won to our cause ; Dull Knife and his band were so unlucky as to deal with Cap - tain ``
Wessels	PERSON	, and the result was the
Fort Robinson	LOCATION	outbreak .

		The event is only second to the
Sand Creek Massacre	ORGANIZATION	, and its stain is indelible .

		The `` fighting Cheyennes '' are a thing of the past , but it is well that they have found their chronicler .

		An interesting thing about the chronicle is the fact that when an official report or an army record comes into conflict with the simple story as told by the red-man , it is found that truth regularly lies with the latter .

		HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE * Rich in facsimiles and in printed extracts is the second part , as was also the first , of
Messrs. J. Pearson & Company	ORGANIZATION	's catalogue of holograph letters and other manuscripts from `` the world 's most eminent actors , actresses , artists , authors , composers , poets , poetesses , scientists , soldiers and statesmen . ''

		Illustrious names fairly monopolize the pages of this attractive catalogue , and make of it a volume that book-lovers will wish to pre - serve for its literary interest , apart from any other considerations .

		It devolved upon the present writer to review for
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
March 1 , 1907	DATE	-RRB- the first volume of a proposed three-volume `` History of Architecture , '' by Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	, the second and third instalments of which were to be immediately forthcoming .

		A little
over three years later	DATE	the second volume appeared .

		Before the proof-reading on this volume had been completed , even , I believe , before all the material had been made ready for the printers , the man who had undertaken the gigantic task of writing this History passed into the beyond , and the work of completing that volume fell to his son .

		It was then announced that Mr.
Arthur L. Frothingham	PERSON	, who had assisted the younger
Sturgis	PERSON	, would undertake the preparation of the third volume and , from Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	's existing notes and data , complete the History .

		And now , at last , the third volume appears , accompanied by a fourth , made necessary in order that the ground be covered fully and the end be made consistent with the beginnings .

		Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	's task has been no ordi - nary one .

		To write a monumental history is difficult enough when the writer has a clear field to survey , and is permitted to lay down the base lines himself .

		But when another has laid down the lines and determined the direc - tions , the task of carrying the work along harmoniously and consistently is indeed a heavy one .

		But Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	has accom - plished this task , and the entire effect is one of unity , although fortunately he has not altogether eliminated his own personal predi - lections or yielded entirely his own point of view .

		Readers of the
History	ORGANIZATION	will remember that Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	, in his preface to the second vol - ume , attempted to explain why architectural history could not be written from the ethnic , social , and psychological standpoints , which THE DIAL 'S review of the first volume had sug - gested as a most interesting method of attack and one employed by modern writers of history in other fields .

		Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	is very evidently of the same mind as the writer of the review referred to , for he states clearly in his interesting introduction to the final vol - umes that were he starting with a free rein he would proceed along the lines referred to .

		And although in the interests of unity and consistency he has conformed to the plan * A HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE .

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	established for him by Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	, yet be - neath it all one feels the pulsing of the deeper running under-current .

		This is particularly noticeable in the dis - quisitions upon the Gothic .

		One could wish that it were equally apparent in the treat - ment of the Renaissance , especially in the initial chapter .

		The Renaissance began in
Italy	LOCATION	and marked , among other things , a revul - sion in favor of art , as against what the more or less decoratively inclined Southern people considered science .

		The art of the Gothic really was art , and did not serve to cover up the science but to adorn it .

		The art of the South was sufficient if it covered up the real and basic thing , or so it would seem .

		The feeling for the horizontal , as against the ver - tical , was ingrained in the Latin peoples , and an application of classic forms so near to their hearts ministered more readily to an aesthetic expression of that feeling than could any further development of the Gothic prin - ciple , however it might be modified by the bands and string-courses or any means of hori - zontal accentuation .

		The Italians never had been able to express themselves in
Northern Gothic	LOCATION	terms , nor could they reconcile them - selves to the forms which the
Southern Gothic	ORGANIZATION	assumed .

		Therefore , the Renaissance in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the reason for its slow spread toward the North .

		These final volumes , which enlarge the bulk and enhance the value of the History beyond the first design , deal with the Gothic and
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	and Modern periods .

		As to the origin of the Gothic , which he sets forth very fully , Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	is in accord with most students except those who ascribe a Teutonic origin to everything continental , in - cluding even the cultural spirit of the Renais - sance in
Italy	LOCATION	!

		The story of the development of the styles in the various localities is instinct with life , and is fascinating to one interested in ethnic and social evolution .

		From Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	's pen we might have ex - pected a well-nigh unabridged study of modern expression , for he was alive to the newer movements .

		But it is perhaps just as well that Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	concluded to deal with modern architecture in a few swift strokes , for after all , we are too much in the picture to recognize its true perspective value , and the things we can be sure of placing properly can be so placed because we rec - ognize their relation to some fixed point in the past .

		And now that Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	has accom - plished this task so successfully and accept - ably , is it too much to ask of him that he undertake the further task of writing a short and spirited history of architecture from the standpoint of ethnics and racial psychology ?

		Such a work would not compete with the present History , and would find a warm welcome in many quarters .

		RECEXT POETRY .

		* The verse of Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	differs in several respects from that most characteristic of the present hour .

		For one thing , it is soundly and steadily rhythmical .

		And for another , it is largely objective even when lyrical whatever the theorists say ; the sub - ject is rarely , if ever , Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	and his highly personal reactions upon life .

		Again , it moves with a kind of colloquial freedom , not giving the impression of being wrought by one who seeks chiefly to be a maker of either images or phrases .

		And lastly , much of it is frankly moral and religious , and does not balk or boggle at the common traditions of the English race .

		Those who have heard Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	read it before an audience are better aware than others can be of the meaning of these qualities : they have perceived the directness , the sturdiness , and the simplicity of the writer , his frank joy in his own melodies and musings , yet with abso - lute freedom from self-exploitation or pose , whether it be a sermon or a story that he has to communicate .

		For myself , I like all these characteristics , and am glad to have another book animated by them .

		Yet I must admit that they show their drawbacks .

		When one has a very strong liking for simple rhythms , a ready flow of words , and plenty to say , with no marked disposition to pause and ponder the more complex nuances either of thought or phrasing , we all know what is likely to happen .

		And with Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	it does happen .

		Sometimes the rhythm seems to be running away with writer , reader , and all , not an unpleasant sensation altogether , but not quite * THE LORD OF MISRULE , and Other Poems .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 331 the pace for getting anywhere .

		I dare to hope much as I have enjoyed it in times past that Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	will write a whole new volume without an instance of that garrulous repetitive effect of which he is so fond When like a sun-lit sea-wave , A green and crimson sea-wave , and the like , with its limitless possibilities for saying a little more than is needful .

		I also venture to hope that he will consider more curiously the values of concentration , of work - manship more closely wrought , which it is hardly thinkable that he should ever overdo .

		There are some signs , in the present volume , of a desire to give larger place to poetic think - ing , as compared with the charm of story and song ; but the results are not altogether happy , because either of insufficient emphasis on structure and form , or of a lack of concern for the values of single lines , sentences , and images .

		My meaning may be made clearer by a reference to
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's rather unmanage - able definition of poetry as an art which proposes `` such delight from the whole as is compatible with a distinct gratification from each component part . ''

		Almost every poem of Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's is excellent in its leading idea ; almost never does he fashion a truly memorable line except in the haunting simplicity of purely songlike utterance such as the much-loved `` Come down to
Kew	LOCATION	in lilac time . ''

		The most pretentious poem in the present volume is that read before the Har - vard chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	, and it well exemplifies what I have said ; for though noble in conception and spirit , it is singularly lack - ing both in firmness of structure and charm of detail .

		Even a patient Phi Beta Kappa audience must have found it taxing .

		But with all this by way of caveat , the book is a good and pleasant thing .

		The title poem is another of Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's studies in the folk-spirit of the Elizabethan age , and combines , in his familiar manner , both narrative and lyrical zest .

		War - themes have their place in other pages , and are treated with dignity and sincerity .

		For reasons which I have tried to state , it is not easy to represent this poet 's work by brief selections ; choosing rather at random , let me quote these caroling verses from a little song called `` Older than the Hills '' : Older than the sea , older than the moon , Older than the heart of the
May	DATE	, What is this blind refrain Of a song that shall remain When the singer is long gone awayf Older than the moon , older than the stars , Older than the wind in the
night	TIME	, Though the young dews are sweet On the heather at our feet And the blue hills laughing back the light , Till the stars grow young , till the hills grow young , O , Love , we shall walk through
Time	ORGANIZATION	, Till we round the world at last , And the future be the past , And the winds of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	greet us from the prime .

		I do not know whose soul Miss
Irene McLeod	PERSON	's volume was designed to save ; for it scarcely shows sufficient unity of purpose to accomplish that high end for either author or reader .

		But it is none the worse reading on that account ; it is , indeed , the poet 's versatil - ity of mood and style which attracts one 's attention almost at first glance .

		A part of the contents seems distinctly youthful , espe - cially in a tendency to use words for the sake of quaint or odd effects , and to shock either taste or attention by trifling impudences ; and some , on the other hand , show a mature simplicity which wins the attention by its intrinsic worth .

		Since I find nothing tempt - ing to discussion in the collection as a whole , I shall take space for representing two of Miss
McLeod	ORGANIZATION	's poems , which give honest pleasure in very different ways .

		Here is surely a fine little study of both rhythm and temperament , called `` Lone Dog '' : I 'm a lean dog , a keen dog , a wild dog , and lone ; I 'm a rough dog , a tough dog , hunting on my own ; I 'm a bad dog , a mad dog , teasing silly sheep ; I love to sit and bay the moon , to keep fat souls from sleep .

		I 'll never be a lap dog , licking dirty feet , - A sleek dog , a meek dog , cringing for my meat , Not for me the fireside , the well-filled plate , But shut door , and sharp stone , and cuff , and kick , and hate .

		Not for me the other dogs , running by my side , Some have run a short while , but none of them would bide .

		O mine is still the lone trail , the hard trail , the best , Wide wind , and wild stars , and the hunger of the quest !

		And here are the closing lines , only , from `` Mother to Son '' : Think you that life can give you pain , Which does not stab in me again ?

		Think you that life can give you pleasure Which is not my undying treasure !

		Think you that life can give you shame Which does not make my pride go lame ?

		And you can do no evil thing Which sears not me with poisoned sting .

		Because of all that I have done , Remember me in life , O son !

		Keep that proud body fine and fair , My love is monumented there .

		For my love make no woman weep , For my love hold no woman cheap , And see you give no woman scorn For that dark night when you were born .

		Beloved , all my years belong To you go thread them for a song .

		332 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	Being a faithful admirer of Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	's writings , I record with regret my suspicion that his publishers set aside for him more white paper than he has matter to fill .

		At any rate , `` The Kocky Road to
Dublin	LOCATION	'' is not the first book of his which seems to have drawn on every last scrap to be found in his current portfolio ; and in this case it would be quite safe to skip the larger half of the contents .

		From time to time , however , one is rewarded by his familiar elf-like humor , peering by preference into the ways of clouds , winds , children , old folks , and other irregular creatures .

		Perhaps most characteristic , of the Irish sketches in the present collection , is this meditation called ``
Dunphy	PERSON	's Corner '' : Pacing slowly down the road Black horses go , with load on load Of
Dublin	LOCATION	people dead , and they Will be covered up in clay .

		Ere their friends go home , each man Will shake his head , and drain a can To
Dublin	LOCATION	people we will meet Not again in
Grafton	LOCATION	street .

		-LRB- Query : is the uncertainty concerning `` will '' and `` shall , '' which Mr.
W. R. Thayer	PERSON	has lately observed is found in the western and southern portions of this country , also trouble - some in
Dublin	LOCATION	? -RRB-

		But nothing in the book is so pretty as the little prologue on the
Cherry Tree	ORGANIZATION	, with its odd echo of Elizabethan naivete : Come from your bed , my drowsy gentleman !

		And you , fair lady , rise and braid your hair , And let the children wash , if wash they can ; If not , assist you them , and make them fair As is the morning and the
morning	TIME	sky , And every tree and bush and bird in air .

		Of American verse I note first two addi - tional volumes in the `` New Poetry Series . ''

		Mrs.
Grace Hazard Conkling	ORGANIZATION	has brought together for `` Afternoons in
April	DATE	'' some fifty lyrics , of which by far the greater number are attempts to reproduce the pleasure she has felt in sound and color .

		She is rather curiously disposed to describe the one type of experience in terms of the other , as if one were to seek to communicate the beauty of a poppy to the blind or that of a song to the deaf .

		Thus ' If form , could waken into lyric sound , This flock of irises like poising birds Would feel song at their slender feathered throats , And pour into a gray-winged aria Their wrinkled silver finger-marked with pearl .

		This flight of ivory roses high along The airy azure of the larkspur spires Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales With too evasive rapture , phrase on phrase .

		Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash , And the black cypress like a deep bassoon Would hum a clouded amber melody .

		Or , reversing the process , on the Mexican nightingale : Clarin , from what glens of air Chime your cameo-colored bells ?

		When they ring , I know them rare , Fluted like the lips of shells For the tone to ripple down , Honey-pale or amber-brown .

		It is certain that Mrs.
Conkling	PERSON	's technical re - sources , for such purposes as this , are notably rich and are dexterously used ; and if her sensuous joys and unconcealed revelling in the arts of fine phrasing tend to pall on the taste , and to make one cry out for a bit more of thinking , it is easy to lay the book aside and come back to it another day .

		After all , it is still permitted to enjoy what is merely beautiful .

		Quite otherwise is it with Mr.
Paul Shivell	PERSON	's `` Stillwater Pastorals . ''

		One of these is ad - dressed `` To a Crooked Stick , '' whose mean - derings in the stream are taken as symbolic of the drifting but predestined ways of human life ; and there is no danger that we shall be lulled by this volume to merely sensuous pleasure .

		Witness this cacophonous opening of a sonnet addressed to a photographer : Never hard light full on thy subject streaming Our carnal cruelty exaggerates ; But as a painter with himself debates , And chooseth values by instinctive scheming .

		But throughout the volume there is the direct recording of a sound and winsome personality .

		The pastoral element is rendered in the manner of
Cowper	PERSON	or
Wordsworth	PERSON	, that is , not by literary inheritance , but through the reappearance of their desire to celebrate the homely joys of sober and simple living .

		On a winter morning Ere yet these grounds and buildings loom from night , Or when by the waning moon kept visible Earth seems to anticipate the winter dawn , And cocks are crowing near and far , I wake , ... Enter the house , light lamp , build fire , strip , bathe , Dashing my body with water fresh from the
spring	DATE	; ... and after I have swallowed A few deep drafts of water I light my lantern And go out under the stars , in the dim moon , Or through black darkness , while the frozen world Is very still .

		One can imagine the amazement , not to say the amusement , with which lines like these are likely to be read in quarters where pleasures or pains of a more thrilling sort seem essential to poetic feeling .

		It was so with Words - worth 's ballads and with
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's peasant pictures .

		And I admit that , taking the col - lection as a whole , I can not quite share the enthusiasm of Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, who introduces it , for the poet 's art ; it is restricted , some - times tamely didactic , far from unerring in technical taste .

		Yet at times it is singularly rewarding , not merely in simple transcripts
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 of life like the one just quoted , but even under such , rigorous formal demands as those of the sonnet .

		Witness this serene and noble example : What if my strength prevail not : is our flesh All there is of us ?

		Have I fallen quite ?

		Is nothing yet reserved to my delight Of all I once enjoyed ?

		Still cool and fresh I feel the dew that never vanisheth From Love 's green hills where youthful poets write ; And still at evening as at morning light I '11 flute and listen and await my death .

		Fair in high noon out on the purple seas Majestic argosies and clouds I watch And marvel at their glory , like a boy Dreaming , who never tires of mysteries , But feels upon his hair his father 's touch , And in his heart shareth his father 's joy .

		Of all the volumes on our list .

		Miss
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	's `` Rivers to the Sea '' represents the closest approach to technical perfection .

		This poet knows the value of concentration ; she knows the nature of a lyric that in order to seem poignantly personal it need not assume an air of shameless self-exposure ; and she knows how to use the imagination as a means of thinking , not merely of feeling .

		All these things deserve wider dissemination .

		Here is a typical little lyric which unpretentiously exemplifies all three : Strephon kissed me in the
spring	DATE	,
Bobin	PERSON	in the fall , But
Colin	PERSON	only looked at me And never kissed at all .

		Strephon 's kiss was lost in jest ,
Robin	PERSON	's lost in play , But the kiss in
Colin	LOCATION	's eyes Haunts me night and day .

		And here one of tragic import , called `` The Poor-House '' : Hope went by and Peace went by And would not enter in ; Youth went by and Health went by And Love that is their kin .

		Those within the house shed tears On their bitter bread ; Some were old , and some were mad , And some were sick a-bed .

		Gray Death saw the wretched house And even he passed by '' They have never lived , ' ' he said , `` They can wait to die . ''

		I wish , too .

		that I might take space to quote the delightful little allegory of `` The Star , '' who counted a wooded pool more profound than the restless sea .

		because it reflected her face more steadily ; until out of the woods as night grew cool A brown pig came to the little pool ; It grunted and splashed and waded in , And the deepest place but reached its chin .

		But I restrain myself .

		It is the quality of verse like this to be quotable , while its author may , on the other hand , never give us the special pleasure stirred by the extended and resounding narratives -LRB- say -RRB- of Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	.

		It is to narrative poetry that we return in the next volume , Mr.
Neihardt	PERSON	's `` Song of
Hugh Glass	PERSON	, '' where `` song '' is intended to be reminiscent of the
Song of Roland	ORGANIZATION	and the epic mood .

		A very interesting experiment this , to treat the adventures of an early trapper of the
American Northwest	ORGANIZATION	with something of epic largeness and against the wide background of the plains and the Mis - souri Valley .

		The story is one of friendship of man and boy , presented with a fine sense of romance and pathos blending with the rugged virility of the hero , and I at least seem to have been moved by it as the writer wished his readers to be .

		The
Missouri River	LOCATION	, he tells us in his preface , was to his own boyhood something like what the sea must have been to Greek boys of antiquity , and `` as I grew older and came to possess more of my inheritance , I began to see that what had enthralled me was , in fact , of the stuff of sagas , a genuine epic cycle in the rough . ''

		It is no easy task to fit a style to such a purpose as this of Mr.
Neihardt	PERSON	's , maintaining the dignity of his larger conception together with veracity of homely detail , and I can not say that he seems always to have succeeded wholly ; there are incidents and descriptions which somehow seem to have been enswathed , half muffled , in the conventional literary phrasing and the couplet verse .

		A little more of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's daring directness may have been needed .

		But these instances are not many .

		And the natural setting is sketched in with skill , all the more notable because of its comparative flatness and want of color .

		Thus Snorting , a-haunch above a breakneck hill , The horse stopped short ; then
Jamie	PERSON	was aware Of lonesome flatlands fading skyward there Beneath him , and , zigzag on either hand , A purple haze denoted how the Grand Forked wide ` twirt sunset and the polar star .

		-LRB- Is this a reminiscence of the ancient Oxus .

		that `` flowed right for the polar star '' ? -RRB-

		And here is the reign of winter in the north country : 'T was warmer now ; the sky grew overcast ; And as
Hugh	PERSON	strode southwestward , all the vast Gray void seemed suddenly astir with wings And multitudinary whisperings The muffled sibilance of tumbling snow .

		It seemed no more might living waters flow ,
Moon	PERSON	gleam , star glint , dawn smoulder through , bird sing , Or ever any fair familiar thing Be so again .

		The outworn winds were furled , Weird weavers of the twilight of a world Wrought , thread on kissing thread , the web of doom .

		Grown insubstantial in the knitted gloom , 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	The bluffs loomed eerie , and the scanty trees Were dwindled to remote dream-traceries , That never might be green or shield a nest .

		The central achievement of the whole volume , however , is its portrait of
Hugh Glass	PERSON	, at once typical of the winners of the West and highly individual in the episode that makes this poem ; and none of this can be represented by extracts .

		Miss
Widdemer	PERSON	's `` The Factories '' takes us from the plains to the heart of the city , and is concerned ' with child labor and other social sores .

		It is also devoted in some degree to the new womanhood of this age , which is inter - preted with genuine imaginative insight .

		I who labored beside my mates when the work of the world began , The watch I kept while my children slept I will keep to-day by Man : I have crouched too long by the little hearths at the bidding of Man my mate I go to kindle the hearth of the world , that Man has made desolate !

		This is Miss
Widdemer	PERSON	's version of the new social sense of her sex .

		She also realizes its potential tragedy as voiced , for instance , by `` The Modern Woman to her Lover '' : I shall not drag at your bridle-rein Knee pressed to knee shall we ride the hill ; I shall not lie to you ever again Will you love me still ?

		It would be easy to cavil at the art of these poems , to remark the strongly editorial character of some , and the obvious and ques - tionable effort to stir up pathos by others ; it would be not unreasonable to suggest that Miss Widdemer depend less largely , for her effects , upon rhetorical refrains in italic type .

		But the earnestness of her purpose to call poetry to the service of a great movement , sometimes with unquestionable success , rebukes such a response .

		And , as if to show us that , if we wish more traditional themes of verse , they can be furnished , she adds a number of lyrics in the more conventional manner , poems of love , youth , and death , which are in some danger of being neglected because they seem almost to be the work of another author than her of the title poems .

		One of the best of them is the last , called `` Wind-Litany , '' clos - ing thus : God , when all of earth shall lie Stripped and new beneath Thine eye , And Thy gold stars fall unstrung , And Thy curtain-sky down-flung , And Thy seas are lifted up Whole from out their empty cup , Grant me still , in
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's place , Sweet swift winds across my facet
Contemporary America	LOCATION	is again very much to the fore in Mr.
Lincoln Colcord	PERSON	's `` Vision of War . ''

		It is also disapproved quite as strongly as by Miss Widdemer .

		The papers , of course , are run to make money , like everything else ; But the trouble is , their income is not derived from their public support ; This is the day of advertising the advertisement is master , not servant , of news ; The advertisers are friendly with the financial crowd of course we have to cut out what they do n't like ; Most of the papers are owned , one way or another , by the financial crowd ; It raises the devil with the whole idea .

		I have deliberately , though not maliciously , chosen for this first specimen of Mr.
Colcord	PERSON	's verse as unbeautiful a passage as I could easily find , in order to represent the frankly exposi - tory , not to say didactic , nature of his work .

		He is not at all afraid of preaching and neither am I ; but in the days when it did not take so much courage to regard poetry as somewhat different from prose , one might have had misgivings .

		At times , however , this book is genuinely imaginative , as well as marked by a sturdy eloquence which may cap - tivate the reader against his will .

		Thus , for instance , is the finer aspect of war defended : There no illusions about the body , no sorrowing or regret ; The body seen in its true place , and given its just due .

		-LRB- Hustle it off , bury it quick , dig a shallow hole ; Dust to dust it will help the next year 's crops ; No time for foolish ceremonies , no ammunition to spare for a parting volley ; It is only death the man is done with his body now it is no more use to him or any one else ; It was never very important not half so important as he himself imagined ; Now it is the least important thing in the world . -RRB-

		There no mistakes about the spirit ; The spirit alone esteemed , the man appraised by his spirit ; All trappings , treasures , accruements , cleared away .

		Despite the crudity of style and the over-loud tone , I find more of poetry here , because more of idealism , than in the insignificant dabbling in sensations of some of the Imagists or the morbid naturalism of the `` Spoon River Anthology . ''

		Mr.
Colcord	PERSON	, as I have just hinted , talks too loud .


John Stuart Mill	PERSON	once said that the difference between poetry and eloquence is that the latter is meant to be heard , the former overheard .

		It is impossible to think of Mr.
Colcord	PERSON	's utterances as being merely `` overheard . ''

		He has the dogmatism of orator , editor , and poet oddly mixed , and the mixture is not a sound one , for while all three are rightly dogmatic , they are dogmatic on totally different grounds .

		But his talk seems to me worth hearing ; he sets one think - ing , in a gusty fashion ; and his vers libre is , I believe , better adapted to his grotesque blend of meditation , editorial , and harangue than it is to lyrical utterances , which one may rightly wish to find under control .

		Both his
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 335 verse and his spirit have more of Whitman in them than have any of Whitman 's imitators that I know , and he presents a nobly spiritual concept of Americanism which is akin to Mr.
BjTiner	PERSON	's in `` The New World . ''

		In the last place we come to Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite 's American Anthologj - for
1915	DATE	, a book which may now be said to have become an institution .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	has amply proved himself gifted as an anthologist ; and any man who is willing to read seven hundred and seventy-two pieces of magazine verse in the year , and to say with definiteness that three hundred and ten of them are poems of distinction , must command our respect , if not something akin to awe .

		A minor matter con - cerning these statistics is revealed in the present volume , namely , that the poems in `` The Atlantic Monthly '' are not included in the count because the editor refuses Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	complimentary copies .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, however , magnanimously reads at least an occasional number , to which he has access presumably in library or club , and includes some of the contents among his selec - tions ; for the first one in the book before me is Judge
Stafford	PERSON	's noble national hymn , `` Invocation . ''

		To review the contents of the Anthology would be to repeat the editor 's task without his industry or equipment ; I shall therefore only say that I doubt if any of us who might question his principles of selection would prove able to do it better .

		Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite 's taste is catholic , and he includes some poems for which I could hardly find a place among the elect , just as Miss
Monroe	PERSON	could find no place for
Bryant	PERSON	in the magazine , `` Poetry . ''

		But we of more fastidious tastes should learn to be liberal ; and because I wish to practise this teaching in all sincerity , I choose for special notice here a poem which I confess I should not cull out for an anthology , but which is distinctly interesting to students of current poetry .

		It is by one Mr.
Richard Glaenzer	PERSON	, is addressed to Mr.
Masters	PERSON	on the subject of his poems about
Spoon River	LOCATION	, and was published in the same periodical in which the latter first appeared .

		Mr.
Glaenzer	PERSON	tells that
Spoon River	LOCATION	came to him as
Chapman	PERSON	's Homer came to
Keats	PERSON	, and , so feeling , he turns upon the critics who , like the present writer , spoke unappreciatively of it because of liter - ary prejudices : they are still squinting , And humming and hawing .

		`` Is this poetry , or is it prose f '' Life must be branded for the market !

		Art must be labelled like a mummy !

		And what of Truth ?

		.

		The rhymers are still mumbling , And invoking Euterpe .

		`` This is not poetry , nor is it prose . ''

		Art must be shapely , gemmed a reliquary !

		Life must be tuneful , like a caged canary !

		And what of Truth ?

		This is an extremely significant expression of a certain point of view , and especially of a certain complete misapprehension of the atti - tude of those who seek to test new poetical | phenomena by principles which have been acquired in the past .

		But I have no space to discuss it here , and therefore leave Mr.
Glaenzer	PERSON	to speak for himself , without grudg - ing his joy in
Spoon River	LOCATION	, but humbly wish - ing that he may hereafter climb
Darien	LOCATION	peaks that look further into the `` pure serene . ''

		Returning to Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, I might cite him as a very positive witness in behalf of an assertion which I made in these columns some months since , that the present state of poetry is far from discouraging .

		His enthu - siasm for the living poets of
America	LOCATION	is inspiriting ; I only wish that it were coupled j with more critical discretion .

		It is good to I err on the side of praise , but Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's | judgments , as found in his collected reviews of current poetry at the close of the
Anthol	PERSON	- ogy , are so lyrically generous that the coinage of his praise must inevitably depreciate .

		Mr.
Colcord	PERSON	's poetry , we are told , reveals `` a Pen - tecostal tongue of fire '' ; Mr.
W. S. Johnson	PERSON	's `` touch is always sure '' ; Mr.
Thomas Jones	PERSON	's verse `` comes to the reader as the essence of a spiritual experience which quickens the pulse to realization '' ; in
Miss McLeod	PERSON	's `` is the echoes -LSB- grammar to the contrary -RSB- of a mystery that troubled the dreams of the earli - est of authentic singers '' ; `` pure lyricism was never more perfectly wrought in our day '' than in the poems of Mr.
O'Sheel	PERSON	; and `` on the topmost peak '' of American poetry `` the place is occupied by the silent and lordly figure of this singer '' viz. , Mr.
Arlington Robinson	PERSON	.

		-LRB- What it is to be a silent singer Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	himself has perhaps desired to know . -RRB-

		It is hard to say whether the matter or the style of these dicta is the more sopho - moric .

		The Anthology , which is beyond question a useful book and a notable labor of love , would be much better off with much less of its editor 's critical prose .

		All of which leads one to wonder what posterity , our only court of appeal , will say to all these men and things .

		As to how it will judge our poets I do not even presume to guess ; but I am perfectly certain that it will find cause for many a merry smile in our poetic criticism both Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's and mine .

		336 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	RECENT FICTION .

		* The reader who is beginning on the new novels this
spring	DATE	may sigh just a little on finding that Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	's new book is about a husband and wife who could not get on with each other .

		So was Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's `` The Great Adventure '' ; so was Miss Glas - gow 's `` Life and Gabriella '' ; so was Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's `` Mrs.
Balfame	PERSON	, '' except that there the husband disappeared early in the business .

		So was Mr.
George	PERSON	's `` The Strangers ' Wed - ding , '' for it would seem that such matters attract attention in
England	LOCATION	as well as with us .

		The novelists of the moment are giving deep thought to the great question -LRB- is it so especially characteristic of our time ? -RRB-

		of how to be unhappy though married .

		The results of their speculation are in one respect the same ; in each case it is the woman who does something about it .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	has the wife vanish away , make a career , and come back ;
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	's wife , released from an un - faithful husband , also makes a career , and finds a more suitable mate ; Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's lady plans to murder her husband , but is saved the trouble by a kind friend ; Mr.
George	PERSON	's Sue merely ca n't stand it , and goes back to an earlier young man .

		Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	's heroine -LRB- if she be one -RRB- waits around till her husband , having gone through the mills of the gods , recognizes her excellence .

		Such flippant and would-be smart mention -LRB- I wish I could do it better -RRB- may seem a very unworthy way to speak of so much sincere effort spent in handling so serious a matter .

		But really , so much of the same sort of thing is not serious , but almost ridiculous .

		A novel of this sort carries little conviction unless it is clearly a first-hand impression of life , a very intense appreciation of some of the conditions that make such things necessary .

		Why other - wise should a novelist 's view of anything be more worth considering than yours or mine ?

		If it be only that he has an idea , and con - ceives his plot and people to express it , he is but availing himself of people 's willingness to read a novel to give publicity to whatever ideas , notions , views , fancies , or what not he has picked up by reading or thinking , just as any one of us may pick up such ideas .

		Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	's book is as good a peg for a dis - course like the above as any other , for it has less character as a novel than his earlier work ; and people will like it or not as they may or may not be taken by the idea .

		much of a story ; what it has is imagined to sustain the thesis .

		Its chief characters are not very good ; the people are too much like the abstractions needed for the situation .

		It has some charming atmosphere or setting , prob - ably because here Mr.
King	PERSON	felt unconstrained and could express freely and sincerely his true and delicate feeling for the beautiful things of nature .

		Its idea , or rather one of its ideas , that real goodness will in course of time have more effect on a man than a pretty face , is sound and very generally known and agreed to .

		I should say that Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	, going from his idea to the life which shall present it , does not sufficiently realize his subject .

		There is too much `` telling '' in the author 's method .

		The people appear before us saying and doing the things they would naturally say and do , but the author apparently has to tell us the important things about them .

		We lear ~ n that Thor held beauty in some scorn , that
Len Willoughby	PERSON	could see he was not wanted in the banking-house , that Mrs. Mas - terton was a person of ostensible native refine - ment , that in
Rosie	LOCATION	's mind
Claude	PERSON	stood for rest , that
Claude	PERSON	loved
Rosie	PERSON	for her pretty - face only -LRB- `` of nothing else was he able to take cognizance '' -RRB- ; and other such matters .

		Per - haps the author could show reason for all such bits of information ; but such things seem to be a reason for the lack of reality in the book , and if in the book , of the idea too .

		The things in the book that are good and there are a number of them come rather by the way .

		The old minister , for instance , is exactly right .

		He may not come directly out of life , but Mr.
King	PERSON	would seem to have so true an idea of what real religion may be in life that he is quite safe in trusting to his imagination .

		It seems as if his main concep - tion were not so well-assured .

		`` The Accolade '' offers a considerable con - trast to such books as have been mentioned .

		Miss Sidgwick is possessed by no abstract generalization , that is , by no obvious one .

		One has , of course , a sort of sinking of heart on beginning a book called `` The Accolade '' ; but one recovers at once on finding oneself safe in that inner ring , that better-than-aris - tocratic society , that idle moneyed world , which has rarely been better presented than in this book and its predecessors .

		On the face of it , the book is a story of people who spend their time doing nothing in particular ; but actually , there is much more to it than the clever observation of an indulgent satirist .

		There may undoubtedly be some idea , ques - tion , view of life implicit in the story , but it is there as it is in life itself , and comes to us
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 337 with the authority not of the author 's general - ization , but of our own .

		Life , as Miss Sidg - wiek sees it , mostly goes on with good houses , servants , clothes , and so forth , with dinners and dances in the season and breakfasts and walks in the countiy , everybody having as good a time as possible in a light-minded way , talking more or less cleverly all the time but never saying anything of much importance .

		Occasionally , however , life offers a clash of great `` sentiments '' ' Miss Sidgwick curi - ously says -LRB- curiously , because in speaking of John she tells us that the Ingestres `` had violent passions but were not sentimental '' -RRB- .

		Then there is a blaze of the real thing , and that is worth while , redeeming ages of rag - ging and idle talk and writing memoirs about one 's ancestors and going to concerts and to theatres .

		Or else for sometimes it seems different at other times life is only a cyni - cal -LRB- not to say brutal -RRB- but disguised battle between men and women , constant decep - tion , constant cruelty , constant pain in which now and then -LRB- O wonderful and immortal gift of otherwise iron gods ! -RRB-

		a man and a \ woman sometimes really love .

		Such varying views Miss Sidgwick may per - I haps have on life ; but if so , she rarely explains her opinions to the reader .

		She naturally enough belongs `` to her own class , '' and uses its language , of which the main principle is that the one thing never to be mentioned is the thing that one is talking about .

		Not that her feeling in the matter is simply the English assurance that it is n't done .

		Of course it isn ' t done , and she doesn ' t do it ; but the fact is quite in keeping with j what I conceive -LRB- modestly and at a distance -RRB- i are her conceptions of the novel-writer 's art .

		i Miss
Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	's people are the natural product of an old and limited culture , and as a result they have a perfectly astound - \ ing knowledge of their own civilization , j - astounding , that is , to outsiders .

		They know people at a glance , or indeed without a glance ; such and such kinds of people -LRB- army people , for instance -RRB- are stupid , others not ; j such and such people are perfectly obvious j types ; such and such social customs , having acolytes and that sort of thing , are perfectly understood ; everybody can be put in some class or other .

		That makes it unnecessary to say anything that conveys information , for I all is naturally known beforehand , by all at !

		least who do know .

		Hence conversation is likely to be merely idle entertainment .

		It is not one of the necessities in the transactions of life , but one of its embellishments .

		All this -LRB- which is little exaggerated -RRB- is not as absurd as it may appear to many ; that sort of thing is merely the putting into rather conventional form of one of the well-known facts of life .

		We none of us can talk well about what we deem most important ; of course people do have `` long and serious talks '' with each other , but they must be chiefly had for the pleasure of talking , which is great ; life goes on without much regard to them .

		And so it is , naturally enough , in some fiction .

		Some novelists want to tell us everything , and that may be a very good thing for people who need to have everything told .

		But for people in general it is better for the novelist not to tell us everything .

		If he presents phases of life that make us appreciate its poignancy , its delights , its tragedies , its cynicisms , its other things , he is doing all he need do ; there is no call for him to stand by with a pointer delivering a lecture on the subject , like
Browning	PERSON	in `` Sordello . ''

		Indeed , the general idea about Miss Sidg - wick is probably not that she does not tell us enough , but that , like Mr.
King	PERSON	, she tells us too much .


John Ingestre	PERSON	, an artistic , brutal , clever , young Englishman , married to a stupid , respectable , and selfish wife , spends most of the time they are together in bally - ragging her .

		After he has done so for some ten years ,
Miss Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	tells us that he has an eager and simple desire to have children .

		Now either this is not so , or else it is a matter of no importance , or else we somehow should have found it out before the book was half over .

		We are told other things about
John	PERSON	, that as time went on he knew better and better what he wanted even though he knew it was foolish , that he was not one who lived by reason , that he charged himself to blast all obstacles to his heart 's desire , and other such things about him .

		Here again if such im - portant things are true , we should not need to be told , and if we are told it is because Miss
Sidgwick	PERSON	has not presented her man suffi - ciently from the first .

		Such little flaws , however , in a piece of refined and exquisite work need not be insisted upon ; they are , indeed , only an uncouth way of disguising one 's more usual pleasure .

		Life itself -LRB- when we get a good look at it -RRB- is so amusing , absorbing , delight - ful , exciting , stirring , thrilling , in fact so beautiful , that one must be immensely the debtor to anybody who is willing to give it to us by itself without the accompaniment of whatever theories , opinions , ideas , solutions of problems , convictions may happen to have resulted as a by-product of one ; s appreciation .

		Canon
Hannay	PERSON	's `` Gossamer '' knocks all the foregoing disquisition on methods in fiction into a cocked-up hat , so far , at least , 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	as he is concerned himself .

		He is intent on pursuing his own object in his own way ; and as he has a very especial gift , the reader is easily charmed into allowing and desiring him to follow his own object in whatever way he sees fit to use .

		His publishers give us the information that this book is more serious than his earlier stories , and add that it is the author 's purpose to present the financial sys - tem of the world which spreads from one royal financier to another like a web of gossamer threads in an autumn field .

		Doubt - less
Canon Hannay	ORGANIZATION	had this idea in mind when he wrote page 135 , though he probably had quite a different one when he wrote page 280 .

		At one time or another he was presum - ably possessed by the enormous purpose of rendering plausible the conception that the immense system of finance by which the world gets along may be really fine , admirable , and beneficial .

		He at least succeeds in making us feel , now and then , what is meant by such a conception .

		But one can hardly believe that his thoughts did not branch out far beyond this rather academic view .

		He seems to have been impressed by something even more im - portant -LRB- to most of us -RRB- , and fundamental .

		To present this important and fundamental something , he chooses a very absurd combina - tion of very characteristic people , who become involved first in the promotion of a new and improved cash register , then in a new develop - ment of the moving picture , and finally in the war .

		An Irish gentleman , a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, a financier , his artistic wife , an inventor , what will one imagine from so jumbled a combination ?

		Canon
Hannay	PERSON	appears to use them to present what might even be called a criticism of life .

		This criticism is expressed in various ways .

		Sometimes it is stated , perhaps very simply , as when the politician remarks wisely : `` Won - derful thing , life , keeps going on .

		Do n't know why it should but it does .

		Nothing seems to make any difference . ''

		Sometimes it is put very wonderfully , as when the wife of the financier -LRB- in bidding good-night -RRB- says : '' There is a spirit which moves the multitudi - nous blind gropings of humanity .

		It moves all unseen and unknown by men , guiding their pitiful endeavors to the Great End .

		That End is Duty .

		That Spirit is Art .

		To rec - ognize it is Faith . ''

		It takes a great humorist to make such utterances appe.ar even for a moment to be significant of deep truths .

		But Canon
Hannay	PERSON	is not satisfied with any such independent statements .

		We might almost say of his people , as Sir
James	PERSON	said of the exhibition of
Tim	PERSON	's new cinematograph , `` I do not know and at the time I did not care in the least what the figures were supposed to be saying or doing .

		It was sufficient for me that they were there . ''

		It would probably be ill-advised and cer - tainly impossible to state in a few words what
Canon Hannay	ORGANIZATION	has taken a book to say .

		It is better to follow the example of the favorite landscape of Mr.
Ascher	PERSON	, who chose for his picture `` the moment while the mys - tery of dawn endured . ''

		It must be enough just here to say that `` Gossamer '' is the book of a man who has thought and felt deeply on many matters besides high finance per - haps even beyond it , and who has devised a singularly perfect way to suggest to us his thinking and his feeling .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		European Among the already large num - dipiomacy prior ber of books dealing with the diplomatic history of
Europe	LOCATION	immediately prior to the outbreak of the present war , Mr.
Arthur Bullard	PERSON	's '' The Diplomacy of the Great War '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is easily the most interesting and in some respects the most valuable .

		It is the work of a widely-trained and remarkably well - informed man , one who is not only familiar with the extensive literature of European foreign policy -LRB- an excellent bibliography of which forms not the least valuable part of his treatise -RRB- , but who is a keen observer of political affairs in
Europe	LOCATION	and who has known personally many of those who have had a share in the conduct of the foreign policies of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		As a starting point , Mr.
Bullard	PERSON	begins with the
Congress of Berlin of 1878	ORGANIZATION	, which he characterizes as a body having been composed largely of incompetents ; and he reviews in turn
Bismarck	LOCATION	's foreign policy , which brought
Austria	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	into alliance with
Germany	LOCATION	, the recovery of
France	LOCATION	from the effects of the war of 1870-71 , the growth of Anglo-German antipathy , the origin and history of the
Entente Cordiale	ORGANIZATION	between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, the Franco-Russian alli - ance , the
Algeciras	LOCATION	crisis , the Agadir and Cassablanca incidents , the diplomatic results of the Turko-Italian and Balkan wars , and the other events which ultimately created a situation needing only the touching of a match to start the tremendous conflagration which is now sweeping over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The point of view of the author is singularly fair and judicial .

		It is not difficult to discover where his sympathies lie in the present conflict , yet he has endeavored to be just in his conclu - 19161 THE DIAL 339 sions , and he has not hesitated to criticize both sides where criticism is clearly justified .

		He blames the Germans for pursuing their `` grandiose ideal '' of Deutschtum to the point of wishing to
Germanize Europe	LOCATION	when the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	did not want to be Germanized ; he accuses the English of jealously disputing
Germany	LOCATION	's ambition to become a maritime , colonial , and commercial rival of
Britannia	LOCATION	; he charges
France	LOCATION	with treating the
Algeciras	LOCATION	convention as a `` scrap of paper '' and of con - tinuing `` blithely as they had been doing in the past undermining the authority of the Sultan -LSB- of
Morocco	LOCATION	-RSB- , fostering a kind of dis - turbance which would give a pretext for armed intervention , and by all sorts of dis - creditable tricks trying to drive out their commercial rivals . ''

		Mr.
Bullard	PERSON	thinks that from
1913	DATE	on the rulers of
Germany	LOCATION	were planning for war in defense of Deutschtum , but he believes it was largely intended as bluff , and that they hoped to get what they wanted without fighting .

		Their criticism of British sea power , he thinks , would be unan - swerable if there were any reason to believe that they objected to any such arbitrary power per se .

New Hebrides	LOCATION	,
Santa Cruz	PERSON	, and Solo - mon Islands , with supplementary visits to
Fiji	LOCATION	,
Tikopea	LOCATION	,
Tonga	LOCATION	, Samoan and
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	, are set forth for the expert and for the general student of sociology and of social evolution in Mr.
W. H. R. Rivers	PERSON	's `` History of Melanesian Society '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Each of the two substantial volumes treats of a differ - ent aspect of the problem .

		The first is a detailed account of the survey work of the author in
Melanesia	LOCATION	and elsewhere in
Oceania	LOCATION	.

		This was directed especially toward the accu - mulation of data regarding kinship , mar - riage , and descent , and regarding other social institutions which would assist in their analy - sis .

		This was based upon the belief that we have in systems of relationship , which in Melanesia are far more complex and utterly different from those of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	civiliza - tion , like fossils , the hidden indications of ancient social institutions , and that their study is essential to the solution of problems in prehistoric sociology .

		They offer trust - worthy objective data incapable of modifica - tion by the collector 's bias or preconceived hypotheses , and are therefore trustworthy .

		The second volume contains an analysis of the data thus assembled , and a theoretical i discussion of their significance .

		The author 's ; main thesis is that social progress results from I the inter-action of peoples , that migrations not only bring new factors and new features into the material culture , and new elements i into the social organization , but that the con - tact and inter-action of the peoples themselves have furnished the starting points for all the great movements in human history which we are accustomed to regard as Progress .

		He does not , however , consider individuals as mere automata for the transmission and the I recombinations of ancestral types of culture , but suggests that contributions may also | spring directly from the ideas , beliefs , emo - tions , and sentiments which serve as motives for the actions of man .

		These do not belong to any one culture , but are natural to man - kind .

		The author finds Melanesian culture complex , but derivable from three sources , a primitive society of dual organization con - sisting of two exogenous moieties with matri - lineal descent , upon which two successive waves of immigration from the
Malay Arehi	LOCATION	- i pelago engrafted many of the characteristic ; institutions of Melanesia .

		The intricacies of the systems of human family relationships of Melanesia are traced to the social adjust - ments consequent upon these migrations .

		The study of these still persisting primitive cul - tures , surviving to our day because of their isolation , is destined in the opinion of the author to be not only of greatest value in the ethnography of the
South Seas	LOCATION	, but also of fundamental significance in studying the origins of human culture in
Eurasia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The advance of civilization , and the migrations of laborers from these islands to and from Aus - tralia , bid fair to destroy forever all trace of these savage societies ; hence our author 's plea for prompt and searching investigation to rescue these evidences of the origins of human culture ere they vanish .

		The treat - ment is comprehensive , scholarly , candid , and logical .

		The work is well illustrated and well indexed , and both in method and in content forms an important contribution to the scien - tific literature of human social origins .

		The public The function of the survey school system not the old-fashioned sort , with mdm theodolite and measuring-chain , but the modern process so designated is in - creasing every year in range and importance , so that now not only have we municipal sur - veys , educational surveys , industrial surveys , economic surveys , and innumerable others , but there is also a widely circulated periodical bearing the name of this wonder-working operation .

		Not the least of the surveys at

Cleveland	LOCATION	is engaged for the purpose of learn - ing all about its educational system and then , if possible , making it better , or , in the words of the
Survey Committee	ORGANIZATION	, '' to create a strong , well informed public opinion in support of an adequate school policy . ''

		A company of ex - perts captained by Dr.
Leonard P. Ayres	PERSON	is studying each a different subdivision of the great educational problem , and the results are to be presented in twenty-five small volumes published a Aveek apart by , and obtainable from , the
Survey Committee of the Cleveland Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first few numbers are al - ready out , and they make a favorable im - pression by their business-like brevity and directness .

		Opening at random one of these treatises , that entitled `` What the Schools Teach and Might Teach , '' by Professor
Frank - lin Bobbitt	PERSON	, we chance upon the following : '' How one reads has received an undue amount of attention ; what one reads in the school courses must and will receive an increasingly large share of time and thought , in the new evaluation . ''

		Again , in '' Health Work in the Public Schools , '' by Dr.
Ayres	PERSON	and Mrs. -LRB- or Miss -RRB-

		In neither case has the close study of documents and the systema - tic search for new sources of evidence been given to the subject , so essential to arriving at definitive results .

		In ``
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	and the
First Monument	ORGANIZATION	of the Classic Kevival in
America	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Fiske Kimball	PERSON	has not only subjected the known material relating to
Jefferson	PERSON	's work as an architect , and more especially to the authorship and design of the
Virginia	LOCATION	state Capitol , to the methods of modern scholarship , but he has succeeded in deciphering a mass of documentary evidence , the importance of which had not been sus - pected .

		While it has long been known that when he was Minister to
France	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	was asked , by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in charge of the
Capitol	ORGANIZATION	, to obtain a design for the building , and that he consulted with the French archi - tect ,
Clerisseau	LOCATION	, there have been until lately no data on w r hich it was possible to base an intelligent opinion as to the probable propor - tion of influence of the two men on the character of the design .

		Through the dis - covery of some autograph drawings and memoranda , clearly by
Jefferson	PERSON	, one is now able to trace with * reasonable certainty the influences which combined to bring about the final result .

		Unfortunately the drawings made by
Clerisseau	ORGANIZATION	's assistants were sent to
Washington	LOCATION	for the use of L ` Enfant in pre - paring a plan for the
National Capitol	ORGANIZATION	.

		As L ` Enfant fell out with the authorities , and retained all the drawings for the plan of the city of
Washington	LOCATION	, the strong presumption is that he kept the plans for the
Virginia	LOCATION	Capitol as well .

		These drawings the final link in the chain have not so far been found .

		However , a minute comparison of
Jefferson	PERSON	's drawings with the completed building would seem to show , beyond reasonable doubt , that the building , and consequently
Clerisseau	PERSON	's drawings , followed very closely the original studies by
Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Kimball	PERSON	has made a careful study of subsequent monuments to determine the historical influence of this first building of the Classic Revival first not only in
America	LOCATION	but , an attempt at least , at a closer following of Classical precedent than had yet been attempted abroad .

		This work , which is a detailed study of one monument , is but a part of a comprehensive study of
Jefferson	PERSON	's work as an architect by the same author , soon to appear , which will serve to clarify the history of a period of American architecture which has hitherto been very obscure .

		The chief significance of the mono - graph lies in the fact that it is one of several similar studies of early American buildings , in which scholarly methods have been used , and from which authoritative results may be expected .

		.

		, The most significant of the points Disguise in the ~ J Elizabethan developed in Dr.
Victor	PERSON	0 .

		Free - burg 's '' Disguise Plots in
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan Drama '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is that the use of disguise may serve as a criterion for judging the technique of a play , as well as for fixing its place in the develop - ment of the drama .

		The modern demand for realism , which forbids the easy methods of the Elizabethan playwright in transforming a character from one sex to the other , or from one station or function in life to another , is such that the device has virtually gone out of 1916J THE DIAL 341 use , except in the surprising disguise that appears , for example , in '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' or the very different '' Seven Keys to
Baldpate	LOCATION	. ''

		And this does not come under the definition of Dr.
Freeburg	PERSON	, who limits his theme to '' a change in personal appearance which leads to mistaken identity , '' and who also excludes such disguise as that of the twins in the '' Comedy of Errors '' or of Vol - pone in
Jonson	LOCATION	's comedy .

		In his chapter on technique the author shows that even within the comparatively narrow period down to
1616	DATE	treated in this book , there was an ad - vance in the desire for realism .

		In the morali - ties it was enough to change the name , and the audience imagined the rest ; later an at - tempt was made to produce as complete an illusion as possible to eye and ear .

		With boys or men playing the parts of women , it was easy for the Elizabethans to accept the supposed transformation from one sex to the other , the one change which we to-day find most difficult ; and with its abundant oppor - tunities for serious and amusing complica - tions , it is not surprising that it should be the most frequent of all the disguises .

		Dr. Free - burg considers it especially in its manifesta - tions of the girl masquerading as a page and the boy as a bride ; the former for romantic purposes , the latter for the sake of a joke or extortion .

		The other most frequent manifes - tations were those of the spy and the lover , both of which might also make use of the sex disguise as a means to an end .

		The technical development of the device is seen in the rela - tion which complication bears to resolution , some plays never revealing the disguise , others using the revelation as the means of resolving the complication .

		Signs of decay in the drama are seen in such sensational extensions as the retro-disguise , or the disguise of the disguised ; and the disguise concealed from the audience till the close of the play , when it comes as a complete surprise .

		Shakespeare avoids this latter device , which
Jonson	PERSON	uses in '' Epicrene , '' and he lets character truly and inevitably reveal itself through all its trap - pings and assumptions .

		Kosalind and
Portia	LOCATION	never cease to be women for all their doublet and hose .

		A bibliography of authorities and of plays , novels , romances , ballads , etc. , is appended to Dr.
Freeburg	PERSON	's volume .

		this interesting people as a distinct unit .

		From time to time during the past decade there has appeared in various historical pub - lications a notable series of articles dealing with important problems in Norman history , written by Professor
Charles H. Haskins	PERSON	, dean of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate school , who is also dean of American mediaevalists .

		In
February , 1915	DATE	,
Dean Haskins	PERSON	presented the more important results of his Norman studies in the form of a series of lectures deliv - ered before the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lec - tures have now been published in a volume bearing the title , '' The Normans in European History '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		In eight brilliant chapters ,
Dean Haskins	PERSON	tells how the
Norman	PERSON	race came into existence , what it achieved in the two centuries of its greatest activity and importance , and what impress it has left on the history of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with a dis - cussion of the Norman land and people , Dean I
Haskins	PERSON	tells briefly of the coming of the Northmen to the
Seine	LOCATION	valley in the tenth century , and then proceeds to trace the activi - ties of the new Norman-French people outside the French kingdom , in the British Isles , in
Naples	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	, and in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		An interesting and highly informing chapter deals with
Norman	PERSON	life and culture , and with the extant monuments of Norman civilization .

		In one important respect
Dean Haskins	PERSON	has introduced a change in historical terminology : what in the past has been called the `` Angevin empire , '' from the controlling dynasty , he calls the `` Norman empire , '' from the con - trolling race .

		It is likely that this suggestion will be accepted .

		The volume possesses cer - tain excellences of literary style which are all too rare in historical writing .

		The history of the Normans and ^ nd `` lnflitence ry th 6 * 1 '' reat achievements in mediaeval
Europe	LOCATION	has been told many times as a part of the history of
France	LOCATION	, of
England	LOCATION	, and of
Italy	LOCATION	; but not until re - cently has a serious effort been made to study
The American Negro	ORGANIZATION	continues Two views of .

		the Negro .

		to be an object of peculiar inter - est to the traveller from abroad .

		Mr.
Maurice S. Evans	PERSON	's `` Black and White in the Southern States '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the work of one who from long residence in
South Africa	LOCATION	has become vitally interested in race problems .

		Realizing fully the pitfalls that beset the path of the hasty observer , he has labored earnestly to make no deductions that are not warranted by his data .

		On the whole , he seems to have succeeded fairly well , and he has considered every phase of the problem .

		Among the more interesting chapters are those on `` Negro Organization Church and Lodge , '' `` The Negro before the Court , '' and one at the end entitled `` For
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' which is intended primarily to give the author 's old acquaintances some suggestion 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	for the solution of their difficulties in the light of his American experience , and which , simply because it shows the writer on ground of which he has real command , is likely to be of more interest to American readers than some of the other chapters .

		Mr.
Evans	PERSON	shows a decided leaning toward the practical and opportunist school of Negro thought , and for this reason -LRB- as in such a chapter as that headed `` The Two Schools '' -RRB- he finds it hard to be fair to those who are more idealistic in their thinking .

		Sometimes , too , we could wish that he had continued his investigations a little further before making his conclusions .

		On the whole , the book contains little that is new .

		Such a volume as Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's falls all too easily into a consideration of the Negro as a problem rather than as a human being .

		Just here is the point that distinguishes from it such a book as Dr.
C. V. Roman	PERSON	's `` American Civilization and the Negro '' -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
F. A. Davis Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a work somewhat below it in literary form , though neither is especially strong in that quality .

		At least one feels here that in large measure the soul of a man has gone into his book .

		Dr.
Koman	PERSON	is a physician of standing in
Nashville	LOCATION	, and he very frankly makes a plea , to some extent along biological lines , for his people .

		His book , we are told -LRB- p. 377 -RRB- , is `` a brief , not a credo ; primarily it is a summary and an analysis of the testi - mony of others , '' being only incidentally an expression of the author 's personal opinions and beliefs .

		As in Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's work , there are frequent quotation marks , and sometimes one wonders if the numerous citations of his - tory and literature are really relevant or necessary .

		However , because the author has lived with the things of which he writes , and because his work has evidently taken its own time in maturing , his book somehow furnishes endless food for thought .

		It shows , moreover , an excellent acquaintance with the literature of the subject , and is well illustrated .

		Ford Hall , named for and owing Seven years its existence to the late
Daniel Sharp Ford	ORGANIZATION	, of `` Youth 's Com - panion '' fame , has been aptly called by one of the constant attendants at its
Sunday	DATE	even - ing meetings , `` the cradle of fraternity , '' just as
Faneuil Hall	ORGANIZATION	in the same city was long ago styled `` the cradle of liberty . ''

		The fraternal weekly gatherings at
Ford Hall	ORGANIZATION	, to listen to some speaker with a message to the people , have for eight years been attracting wider and wider attention , until now the
Ford Hall	ORGANIZATION	idea and open forum movement are known throughout the country .

		Mr.
George W. Coleman	PERSON	, to whose inspiration and un - selfish zeal these meetings owe their origin and continuance , has planned , compiled , and edited `` a symposium '' having as its title `` Democracy in the Making '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and sub-titled , `` Ford Hall and the Open Forum Movement . ''

		Its purpose is `` to give the facts about
Ford Hall	ORGANIZATION	, to set forth its spirit , and make plain its mission , in the hope that others will undertake the establish - ment of similar meetings elsewhere . ''

		The four parts into which the book is divided `` tell in turn how the work is done , what is thought of it , who are in the audience , and what is the character of the addresses deliv - ered there . ''

		The various chapters are volun - tary contributions from persons prominent in Ford Hall activities , notably Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	, Executive Secretary of the meetings , who gives a breezy sketch of `` dramatic incidents '' and an interesting `` roll of personalities . ''

		Profits from the sale of the book will go to the
Ford Hall Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Africa as the battle-ground of 8es li v i n o languages in the making - is the fascinating picture one gets from Professor
Carl Meinhof	PERSON	's '' Intro - duction to the Study of African Languages '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , recently translated by Dr.
A. Werner	PERSON	.

		An accompanying map by
Bern	LOCATION	- hard Struck exhibits the following astounding linguistic resources of the continent : Semitic .

		10 languages and 12 dialects ;
Hamitic	LOCATION	, 47 lan - guages and 71 dialects ;
Bantu	LOCATION	, 182 languages and 119 dialects ; Sudanic , 264 languages and 114 dialects ;
Bushman	PERSON	, 11 languages and 3 dialects ; besides Hottentot , which investiga - tion has barely touched .

		The book is an elementary and profoundly significant con - tribution to the science of comparative lan - guage study .

		As such it will be of prime interest to every student of any language , whether or not he has the slightest direct concern with African tongues .

		The author stoutly maintains that `` the linguist working at primitive languages has to deal with much better and more trustworthy materials than the ordinary philologist . ''

		The discussion of well known linguistic phenomena , such as
Grimm	PERSON	's Law ,
Ablaut	LOCATION	, the i umlaut , as well as the general remarks on Phonetics , Grammar , and
Morphology	ORGANIZATION	, are of absorbing interest .

		To the amateur , the most remarkable feature of these strange agglutinative tongues is the part which melody or pitch plays in word meanings .

		Even more important than accent to us is pitch to the Bantu peoples .

		For in - stance , in Ewe , the two words ele afi may be
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 intoned to mean either `` he is here , '' or '' he rubbed himself with ashes , '' or `` he caught a mouse . ''

		The present reviewer , reading from the angle of a student of Old English , finds a number of curious resemblances to primitive phenomena in that tongue ; and no doubt stu - dents in other fields would note similar coinci - dences .

		The author 's honest zeal is shown by the fact that he has studied the Bantu lan - guages for twenty-five years , and has so far refrained from writing his contemplated '' Comparative Grammar . ''

		He has published only the '' Outlines '' -LRB- Grundziige ,
Berlin	LOCATION	,
1906	DATE	-RRB- .

		It is noteworthy that during the pres - ent suspension of scholarly work in
Europe	LOCATION	, lectures by a German can still be translated by one connected with an
English University	ORGANIZATION	, and published by an English house .

		However , nothing could be more dispassionate and neu - tral than comparative philology .

		A new student 's manual .

		`` How to Study and What to Study '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Rich	PERSON	- ard
L. Sandwick	PERSON	, principal of the
Deerfield-Shields High School	ORGANIZATION	,
Highland Park	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, is a well written volume the perusal of which will stimulate and otherwise improve the average reader of high school or college age .

		A few of the elder generation will be reminded by it of the Rev.
John Todd	PERSON	's `` Student 's Manual '' of thirty years ago , a work characterized by deep and effective moral earnestness .

		Mr.
Sandwick	PERSON	's manual is directed solely toward intellectual ends .

		The first part , entitled `` The Principles of Effec - tive Study . ''

		treats of such subjects as study - ing aloud , the value of a synopsis , when and how to read rapidly , and study and fatigue .

		The second part , on `` What to Study and How . ''

		is not , as might be supposed , devoted to a plea for any particular course or branch of study , but presents concisely , and probably as impartially as possible , the ordinarily ac - cepted reasons for the study of the branches usual in the high school , including chapters on the vocational studies and the older pro- fessions .

		Methods of study are also recom - mended .

		The author bases his work on thirty pedagogical works cited in the preface .

		Its prevailing tone is nevertheless that of reality and common sense .

		Chapters of anecdotal biography .

		Mrs.
A. M. W. Stirling	PERSON	's re - searches among musty memoirs have borne fruit in a collection of anecdotal biographies the reverse of musty , entitled `` A Painter of Dreams , and Other Biographical Studies '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The painter referred to is the late
Roddani Spencer Stan	PERSON	- hope , uncle of the author .

		The seven studies in the book treat of
Diana Bosville	PERSON	's `` Book of Extracts , '' an old-fashioned scrap-book of the Georgian era ; her son
William Bosville	PERSON	, introduced to us as `` A Friend of Freedom '' ; the autocratic
William Anne Keppel	PERSON	, second
Earl	PERSON	of
Albemarle	LOCATION	; the beautiful
Elizabeth Patterson	PERSON	, afterward
Madame Bonaparte	PERSON	, `` A Dupe of Destiny , '' as she is called in the chapter-heading ; her even more beautiful sister-in-law , Mrs.
Robert Patterson	PERSON	-LRB-
Mary Caton	PERSON	-RRB- , `` A Favorite of Destiny '' ; the eminent painter of horses and other animals ,
John Frederick Herring	PERSON	, `` A Painter of Realities '' ; and the artist who , as `` a painter of dreams , '' supplies the book with its title .

		More truly descriptive of the volume would have been the heading to its first chapter , * ' A Georgian Scrap-Book , '' but Mrs.
Sterling	PERSON	ably defends her choice of a title , and surely she has a right to christen the offspring of her brain .

		It is an entertaining and often amusing book .

		A por - tion of its contents has already found favor with the editor and the readers of a leading English review .

		Fifteen full-page illustra - tions are inserted .

		A useful summary of events in the great war , from I the beginning to the present time , is appended .

		| '' The American Whitaker '' promises to become as ; indispensable in this country as its English proto - type has long been abroad .

		An attractive volume with the captivating title , !

		`` Legends of Gods and Ghosts , '' is published by ;
Messrs. G. H. Ellis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author , Mr.
W. D. ; Westervelt	PERSON	, who is also the author of '' Legends of | Old
Honolulu	LOCATION	, '' has lived for many years in the I
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	, and this interpretation of i Hawaiian mythology shows a depth of sympathy I commensurable with that of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	for the Japanese .

		Some of the stories , as for example the last in the volume , u The Bride from the Under - World , '' are told with spirit and charm .

		The details of newspaper desk-work , especially copy-reading , and after that headline-writing , proof-reading , make-up , and what are known as `` re-write '' and `` follow-up '' `` stories , '' witjfc chapters on printing machinery and processes and '' small publication work , '' will be found in the compact and attractive manual entitled `` News - paper Editing -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Grant Milnor Hyde	PERSON	, formerly on the staff of a
New York City	LOCATION	daily , and now instructor in journalism at
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book supplements the same author 's '' Newspaper Reporting and 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	Correspondence , '' and gives to editorial and other desk-work a careful attention that is found in few of any previous handbooks for the use of prospective journalists .

		A useful chronology of the printing art and of newspaper development is appended , also a '' style sheet , '' with general direc - tions for the preparation of copy .

		A good index closes the book .

		Mr.
Ernest A. Bench	PERSON	's '' Making the Movies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a crisply written and neatly printed little book of forty diminutive chapters on such subjects as : Putting on a Photoplay , Do the Players Drink Intoxicants in
Motion Pictures	ORGANIZATION	, Movie Stars Who Risk Their Lives ,
Motion Picture Making Towns	ORGANIZATION	and Estates , How Railroad Photo - plays Are Made , Aviation in the Movies , Filming Earthquakes , Floriculture by
Motion Pictures	ORGANIZATION	, Making Films under the Sea , In a Film Factory .

		As the forty chapters amount to only one hundred and seventy-six pages , whose content is besides , after the manner of stage talk , somewhat gossipy , the reader who is led by the title and chapter - headings to expect detailed and thorough informa - tion should not be surprised to find the book dis - appointingly slight .

		To their excellent `` Musicians Library , '' the merits of which must by this time be well known to every music lover , Messrs.
Ditson	PERSON	have lately added a two-volume collection of `` Modern Rus - sian Piano Music '' edited by
Constantin von Sternberg	PERSON	, and a book of `` Sixty Irish Songs '' selected and edited by Mr.
William Arms Fisher	PERSON	.

		The present Russian renascence makes the first - named work particularly timely and welcome .

		Pro- duced in similar form and equally irreproachable in external details , though not part of the same series , are two other recent publications of Messrs.
Ditson	PERSON	`` My Favorite French Songs , '' selected by
Madame Calve	ORGANIZATION	, and `` My Favorite Songs , '' selected by Miss
Julia Gulp	PERSON	.

		Each of these collections is in two volumes , and together they provide the soprano singer with infinite musical riches in a little room .

		Notwithstanding heavy difficulties which the war must impose upon its editors and publishers , the ''
Loeb	PERSON	Classical Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- continues to make steady and satisfactory progress .

		The latest instalment of half a dozen volumes is evenly divided between the Greek and Latin sections .

		In the former , we have '' The Odes of Pindar , '' trans - lated by Sir
John Sandys	PERSON	; the second volume of
Lucian	PERSON	, in the translation by Professor
Harmon	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	; and Hesiod , the Homeric Hymns , and
Homerica	ORGANIZATION	, comprising in a single volume prac - tically all that remains of the post-Homeric and pre-academic epic poetry , translated by Dr.
Hugh G. Evelyn	PERSON	- White .

		For the two additions to the Latin section , the editors have wisely had recourse -LRB- not , however , without considerable redaction -RRB- to translations which have become as classic in their way as the originals , that of
William Melmoth	PERSON	for the two-volume edition of
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	's Letters , and that of
W. Adlington	PERSON	for '' The Golden Ass '' of Apuleius .

		The support and encouragement of this splendid series on the part of scholarly readers can not be too often or insistently urged .

		Distinctly inferior in quality to certain of its predecessors is Mr.
Eric Fisher	PERSON	Wood 's plea for greater defences , entitled `` The Writing on the Wall '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is not less modest , how - ever , in its views of what constitutes adequate defence , for it declares that unless we secure our coasts by a navy virtually twice as large and effective as that of any other nation , we need a minimum of 2,500,000 men to defend our territory against invasion by any single great power .

		These estimates might well have been suspected to be those of military men , without Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's acknowledgment to that effect .

		They rest upon a comparison of our military establishment with those of potential adversaries ; it is like comparing the fists or teeth of two persons , and from these determining their relative strength .

		Happily , there are things besides teeth and fists that make for strength ; and in such our rating is not hopeless .

		A curiosity in limited editions is Mr.
Charles N. Elliott	PERSON	's `` Walt Whitman as Man , Poet and Friend '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , being the result of nearly twenty years of occasional letter writing to Whit - man 's friends and admirers , soliciting some auto - graph reminiscence or anecdote of the poet or some tribute to his genius .

		More than two-score replies are here reproduced in facsimile , with appropriate quotations , prose and verse , from Whitman himself , from Mr.
Horace Traubel	PERSON	, and from other Whitman-lovers .

		Inevitably the fac - simile plan of the book has involved the printing of much atrocious handwriting , while there is -LRB- in - evitably also -RRB- no great amount of really valuable new literature on the man , poet , and friend , Whitman ; but the whole forms a pleasing and uncommon souvenir of the imperishable '' Walt , '' its constituent parts signed by men so diverse in character and tastes as
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	and
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	,
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	and
Peter Doyle	PERSON	, Professor
Dowden	PERSON	and
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	.

		Of chief interest among the latest additions to '' Everyman 's Library '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a two-volume edition of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's `` Short History of
England	LOCATION	, '' edited and revised by Mr.
L. Cecil Jane	PERSON	, with an appendix by Dr.
R. P. Farley	PERSON	continuing the his - tory from
Waterloo	LOCATION	-LRB- where Green left it -RRB- to
1914	DATE	.

		Welcome , also , is a volume of
William Penn	LOCATION	's collected writings , leading off with the '' Essay toward the Present and Future Peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, by the Establishment of an European Parliament , or Estates , '' as timely to-day as when it first ap - peared in
1693	DATE	.

		Two volumes of Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	's stories ought to do something toward reawakening the spell which that writer exercised upon youthful readers of an earlier generation , particularly when '' Jackanapes '' is given the added charm of Ran - dolph

		In addition to these volumes , we have Balzac 's '' Ursule Mirouet '' ;
George Macdonald	PERSON	's '' Phantastes '' ; Ibsen 's '' Lady Inger , '' `` The League of Youth , '' and `` Love 's Comedy , '' in a single volume ; Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's '' Scope and

		The volume will contain a collection of about twenty-five representative plays , showing the development of the drama from ear - liest times to the present day .

		`` Shakespeare the Player and
Other Papers Illustrative of Shakespeare 's Personality	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Alexander Cargill	PERSON	, will be published in time for the forthcoming tercentenary celebrations .

		The author has gathered all the accredited facts relating to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's career as a player , and endeav - ored to discern something of his form and personality from the evidence of his contem - poraries .

		Among other forthcoming publications of the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	are : `` Essays in Experimental Logic , '' by Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	; `` Principles of Money and Banking , Developed in a Series of Readings , '' edited by Mr.
Harold G. Moulton	PERSON	; `` The Story of the New Testament , '' by Dr.
Edgar Johnson Goodspeed	PERSON	; and `` The
Nulli	PERSON	- fication Controversy in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Clarence S. Boucher	PERSON	.

		For nearly three years Mr.
Fremont Rider	PERSON	, editor of `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' has been supervising the preparation of an entirety new series of guide books , which aim to do for
America	LOCATION	-LRB- the
United States	LOCATION	in particular -RRB- what the
Baedeker	LOCATION	guides have done for
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In form they will resemble
Baedeker	PERSON	, and will con - tain no illustrations other than maps and plans .

		The first volume , `` Rider 's
New York City	LOCATION	, '' is now in press .

		Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	are the publishers of the series .

		A correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' sends to that journal the following note on the funeral of
Henry James	PERSON	: `` Many besides Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	of those who on
Friday	DATE	paid their last tribute to
Henry James	PERSON	must have been penetrated with the extraordinary appropriateness of the setting to the occasion .

		Nothing - could have been more con - 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 30	DATE	sonant with his own feeling and genius than this wonderful old
London	LOCATION	church , by some miracle probably the most unspoilt in all
England	LOCATION	, from whose aisles and monuments a thousand associa - tions rise like incense , and whose speaking silence seems to teach in all its deep humanity , compunc - tion , and understanding the very ' lesson of the Master . '

		The green wreath lay on the pall , but there was an irresistible conviction that the ardu - ous spirit was persistent and communicant in the very air .

		A rash suggestion had been somewhere put forward that the funeral of
Henry James	PERSON	should be celebrated in the
Abbey	LOCATION	.

		How thankful those who most reverence his memory must be that we have been spared any discussion or differ - ence on such a point , and that in
Chelsea	LOCATION	Old Church all voices and all thoughts have been in unison , nothing but well and fair , and the last scene so felicitous and worthy of its hero . ''

		In connection with the
Shakespeare Tercenten	ORGANIZATION	- ary the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	will publish , in two volumes , a work entitled '' The England of Shakespeare , '' containing an elaborate account of the life , society , customs , institutions , and recrea - tions of the Elizabethan age , the materials for which have been collected , with the assistance of many collaborators , by Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		Thus Dr.
Henry Bradley	PERSON	deals with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's English ,
Sir E. Maunde Thompson	PERSON	with hand - writing , Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	with the Elizabethan age , Mr.
J. W. Fortescue	PERSON	with the chase , Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer with plants , and Professor
Firth	PERSON	with ballads .

		Other chapters deal with authors and patrons , booksellers , printers , and the station - er 's trade , the playhouses , rogues and vagabonds , the Court , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, voyages and ex - ploration , religion , learning and scholarship , etc. , the whole object being to familiarize the reader with the background and atmosphere of Shakes - peare 's plays .

		The two volumes are now passing through the press under the general editorship of Mr.
C. T. Onions	PERSON	.

SHANE LESLIE	PERSON	Mr.
Shane Leslie	PERSON	, a brilliant young graduate of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, with wide and interesting con - nections both in
Ireland	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, has written in this book a notable contribution to the memoir literature of his generation .

		The conception , which came to him naturally with his view of the great convulsion which drew him at once into service at the front , is indicated in his title .

		He felt , with countless others , that he was living `` at the end of a chapter in history . ''

		As a grandson of the veteran Sir
John Leslie	PERSON	, who had known half the famous Englishmen of his century , from the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	down ; as the nephew of Lady
Randolph	PERSON	and the cousin of
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	, and with a wide acquaintance among the leaders of _ his own gen - eration , he has a remarkable store of reminiscence and anecdote to draw upon , and has brought a keen and exceptional mind to bear on the questions of his time .

		The titles of his chapters suggest something of the book 's attractions : `` Links with the Past , '' `` Eton College , '' `` The Dynasty of
Hanover	LOCATION	, '' ``
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Religion of
England	LOCATION	, '' `` The Politicians , '' ``

		392 IDEAS , SEX , AND THE NOVEL .

		We have been hearing a good deal lately about the novel of ideas .

		It is understood to be a comparatively recent product ; not at all the same thing , for instance , as the problem novel we used to be hearing of .

		To put it concretely , one is to the other as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	to Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and his disciples are supposed to stand par - ticularly for this new kind of thing .

		They are not simply story-tellers ; they have a larger function .

		When they sit down to write novels , it is a pretty serious business .

		Not that they pull a long face over it : motley is their wear .

		But it is not , so to speak , their underwear ; that article we take to be stout buckram or chain-mail .

		For these are war - riors of the mind .

		Their real affair is not to entertain people , but to propagate the faith ; and their weapon is the `` idea . ''

		Unluckily , it is rather hard in practice to tell an idea from an abstract theory , or a personal prejudice , or a poetic fancy , or a fact recorded , or a platform , or a mere notion .

		But , as far as we can detach them , most of the serious ideas in current fiction seem to be based on reaction .

		This , of course , is the natural thing .

		Every age has its modernism , and modernism is always first of all a revolt against the smug and orderly past , a search for reality , a `` return to nature . ''

		Therefore the current novel of ideas is anti- Victorian or anti-Georgian first , and -LRB- perhaps -RRB- some - thing else next .

		Often our champions of the present find it hard to turn away from the pleasantest and easiest part of their task gunning for the past .

		The ridicule of ancestors is now almost as obligatory among Western peoples as their worship is in
China	LOCATION	.

		The unpardonable sin is regard for conven - tion : we must be jolted out of that before anything can really be done for us .

		And the novel , with its fulcrum of the story , its -LRB- inherited -RRB- pretence of entertainment , is as handy a tool as may be , unless you are among the lucky ones , the Shaws -LRB- if twain there be -RRB- , who have somehow got a thumb upon the theatre .

		Yet these new novelists of 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	ours , with the ideas , can not be disposed of as mere pretenders .

		Most of them display undeniable quality as story-tellers .

		They have the technique of the art at their fingers ' ends , are entirely at home upon those high levels of workmanship which are the peculiar vaunt of our time .

		They can do what they like with their material as far as the limits of their talent and the nature of their material let them .

		One of
Henry James	PERSON	's last critical excur - sions led him into this bailiwick of the `` new '' novel .

		He found there great talent -LRB- always a little short of genius -RRB- , expressing `` an appe - tite for a closer notation , a sharper specifica - tion of the signs of life , of consciousness , of the human scene and the human subject in general , than the three or four generations before us had been at all moved to insist on . ''

		He found there also an `` inordinate posses - sion '' of concrete materials , a knack of `` saturation , '' and of subsequent expression as you express the water from a full sponge or the juice from a ripe orange .

		And along - side of such saturations with scene or type as that of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	with the Five Towns and the middle-class provincialism they embody , he observes certain other saturations of less material sort , as that of Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	with the spirit of youth , or that of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	with his own ideas .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, he says , is `` a novelist very much as Lord
Bacon	PERSON	was a philosopher , '' and is satisfied to `` turn out his mind and its contents upon us by any free familiar gesture and as from a high window forever open . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	did not relish this view of him , and retorted upon his critic with a lively caricature in the `` Boon '' volume .

		But there is more than a little truth in it , if not the whole truth , as applied , I think , not only to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, but to some of the younger men whose saturation Mr.
James	PERSON	refers to the material plane .

		Unluckily , as with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, their inordinate possession of facts is almost inextricably involved with their inordinate possession by ideas .

		What then , their realistic method of story - telling apart , are the ideas these `` new '' nov - elists present ?

		Alas , what is an idea ?

		Usage gives us choice of a dozen meanings .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	turns out for our examination , at one time or another , pretty much every kind of mental exhibit that the term can possibly include , prejudices , enthusiasms , grave the - ories , fantastic theories , dreams , forecasts .

		One mood or , if you choose , idea prevails .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is a prophet , and his glorious future , like most glorious futures , hangs upon a demolished past .

		Things are wrong , smash them !

		Then we 'll see about building up again .

		The `` mind of the race '' exists , but half - enslaved : it is bound to express itself fully when once it has made sure of its freedom .

		How pitifully , after all the centu - ries , we are tied to empty forms !

		Eeligion , how ineffectual ; government , how clumsy ; the attitude of age towards youth , how futile ; marriage , how deadly in its possi - bilities !

		The whole question of sex , how crucial , how absorbing , how absorbent of all other questions that exist under the canopy !

		Eevolt , progress , `` new '' movements , when have they not centred in an attempted read - justment of the sex-affair ?

		You may tinker with other established human relations , but not too rudely , if you really expect a serious hearing .

		Society , after all , depends on some sort of government for its safety .

		Men will always be cajoling themselves with some kind of religion .

		But the marriage-tie , the fetich of sex-morality regulated by code , here , at least , is a convention we can rid ourselves of comfortably .

		It is a nuisance to begin with , and the existence of the race by no means hangs upon it .

		Here , therefore , is the place to strike in , when we set about disposing of the old lumber piled around us by the mud - dling past .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	-LRB- to return to our example -RRB- is concerned with many other themes , and yet he can never get away , in a sense he can never quite afford to get away , from this one .

		For it is the theme which brings him closest to his audience .

		His splendid childlike dreams of the future , of a world governed by the `` mind of the race '' as embodied in a natural and veritable aristoc - racy , remain dreams after all .

		They have power to stir the fancy , or even the white corpuscles ; and yet they are pretty remote , we secretly feel , from the real business of life as life lives us .

		On the other hand , when he displays the frailty of the family tie , the discomforts of the marriage relation , when he assures us that we may fitly and even nobly cast off a lot of the burdens we have been taught to smile under , it is then that he is most warmly read and talked of .

		Where the prophet has captured his thousands of hear -
1916	DATE	-RSB- ers , the iconoclast has captured his tens of thousands .

		I suspect it might be more instructive than edifying if some inspired statistician were to tabulate for us the part played by sexual curiosity and incitement in the public patron - age of novels possessing genuine literary merit which have been produced during the past decade or two .

		Surely , more than one author of serious purpose must have been humiliated by a sense of the meretricious nature of a sudden popularity due to excep - tional frankness upon the perennial theme .

		The pursuit of `` realism '' has involved special risk of this sort .

		`` The real facts of life '' is a phrase which seems too often , as I was say - ing the other day , to be nothing better than an euphemism for the risky or dreary side of sex .

		There are , after all , so many other things in the world !

		decency among them .

		Heaven defend us from a return to the prudery of the Victorian regime !

		The nineteenth century was deplorably fond of playing ostrich .

		But there are less decent birds , the parakeet , say .

		I for one believe that reticence , in life and in art , is a less corrupting influence than loose babbling .

		By all means let us tell our children all we can , as simply as we can , about the essential facts of sex .

		But it , does not follow that we need introduce them into brothels , or even into our own bedchambers .

		Let us by all means , as adults , get rid of the smoking-room leer and the boudoir giggle , and speak as men and women , when occasion arises , of matters which concern us .

		We may still be chary of saddling our physiology and pathology upon the novel or any other form of art .

		We may , to take larger ground , be chary of imperiling the true ends of art for the sake of any other ends whatever .

		It is all very well to say that there is nothing sacred about art , that life is far more important , and that if you can `` put across '' a working idea under the color of art , so much the better for life .

		The argument is especially plausible in regard to the novel , partly because it is the loosest and most flexible of all forms of art , and partly because story-telling starts with fable and parable , with instilling ideas and pointing morals .

		Fable and parable are distinct and intelligible forms , still fit for noble uses , as
William Morris	PERSON	, or more recently Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, has shown .

		In the more complex orders of story-telling also , moral and intel - lectual ideas are bound to be present .

		In a sense , there never was a story without such an idea , however feebly conceived , behind it .

		But in the higher orders it stays behind ; at least , however unmistakably it may inspire or inform the story , it does not prod and bully it , does not skip about upon the surface , and sacrifice true action and true characterization to its own vanity .

		What interests me when I take up a new book calling itself a serious novel , is whether I am going to find a gar - nished idea , or an interpretation of life through character and action , a document , or a true story .

		I find the first thing far oftener than the second : that is to be expected .

		But what ought not to be quite so much a matter of course is that half the time the writer has not really tried to tell a true story .

		He means to report a case or to expound a theory , or at the best to build a fable , ^ and he must straightway botch his job by idling with the machinery of action and of character !

		The mongrel product we proceed to classify and dignify under the name of novel !

		And indeed it is often hard enough to judge of such books .

		In a larger sense there is sure to be some idea or system of ideas some working philosophy , as the phrase goes behind the labor of every novelist who is anything more than the slave of his mechanism .

		It may be the idea of man 's brutality , or of his angelic .

		possibilities ; of the conditions of his domestic happiness or his usefulness in the world .

		Such an idea is always likely to crop up to the surface and get in the way of the artist 's effort , when it should be content to underlie and fructify it .

		On the other hand , not a few writers who have set out with the vile inten - tion of using fiction as a sugar-coating for their lectures or their sermons have builded better than they knew have been insensibly seduced into something at least approaching true invention and characterization .

		They are rather ashamed of that .

		Here is a pretty good example of the new novelist and his nonchalant ways .

		One of the most brilliant of the younger English group gives an account of his entrance into fiction .

		He had been for some years a student of serious matters , and had published the results of his study through formal channels .

		He had no wish to be a literary artist , but he saw that the novel offered a popular medium : `` I saw that nobody takes a theory seriously 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	if you say it in a serious book .

		I saw that I had wasted years on housing and municipal milk ; I hurled my blue-books down the base - ment stairs , and in delicious fury wrote ` The . '

		This , in short , was a novel with an idea or purpose frankly displayed from the first page . ''

		It was , the author goes on to confess , `` the hot controversial production of a young mind , anxious to strike a blow for woman , to make society swallow the fact that under present conditions woman is driven into abominable trade , to make society ashamed . ''

		This is all very well ; but the pamphleteer had the story-telling instinct , and duly produced the inevitable hybrid and succeeded in making a portion of society curious if not ashamed .

		He had dealt freely , that is , with certain `` facts of life , '' aided by a glamour of art ; and he did not care greatly whether that was a false glamour or not .

		In his later books the story-teller has gained upon the pamphleteer ; but , an avowed feminist , he continues to make a rather shameful thing of sex , and it is little less than pitiful to find him still crowing over his ability to shock .

		It is so easy to be shocking , and so little to the purpose for any man who has it in him to be about the great affirmative business of art .

		I have been speaking of the newer English novelists : our own current fiction shows the same confusion of motive and effect .

		Muck - raking , social and economic problems , sex pathology , can we never get them out of the foreground ?

		Is the novel so poor a thing as this a vehicle for theories , for reports , for arguments and rebuttals , for garbage of one sort or another ?

		Or may we rightfully look to it , when it is really itself , as an embodi - ment , through the interpretation of human character in action , of the great ideas which underlie them , of truth ?

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		From the great mass of war books published during the past year and a half among the French-speaking nations , I have selected for brief notice those which follow mainly because they best illustrate in some way the more spiritual aspects of the present conflict , their authors standing for what is more high - minded or characteristic of the finer part of our poor human nature , whether displayed at the fireside at home or in the trenches at the front .

		So this letter should furnish not only some bibliographical data and perhaps a few critical reflections , but may reveal here and there the underlying moral features of the tremendous contest , especially on the admir - able French side , where the eyes of the world have been so often centred since the
autumn of 1914	DATE	.

		In the first place , it should be noted that many of these writers bear in silence a heavy - burden of personal sorrow in addition to their more public weight of grief as citizens of a suffering country .

		This spirit of solemn earn - estness has penetrated their whole work , as you readily perceive when you chance to learn of the existence of this burden , and gives to this work a deep and touching imprint .

		Let me offer one or two signal instances of this which have recently come under my own eye .

		Professor
Paul Stapfer	PERSON	, dean emeritus of
Bordeaux University	ORGANIZATION	, is now seventy-six years old , but is still vigorous intellectually and still adding new volumes to the more than thirty which he has published during a long and active life .

		When a young man fresh from college , he was the tutor of the grand - children of Guizot , and a little later , while teacher of French at the
Royal Elizabeth College	ORGANIZATION	at
Guernsey	LOCATION	, he became very well acquainted with
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		His doctor 's thesis was on
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	.

		He was sus - pended for six months from his duties as dean because of his open support of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such , briefly told , is the past of the noble scholar who handed me quietly the other day a pamphlet , `` Douze Sermons sur la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Fischbacher	PERSON	, 1 fr .

		50 -RRB- containing a dozen sermons preached last autumn in a country parish in the
Gironde	LOCATION	.

		The incum - bent was at the front , and Professor Stapfer , though not himself of the cloth , was asked to fill the vacant pulpit .

		These circumstances in themselves would have sufficed to give a certain touch of solemnity to the pamphlet , but when I reached my hotel and glanced at the first page , I read this dedication : '' To my grandnephews who have died for our coun - try , '' six in all are mentioned , three bearing the great Protestant name of
Monod	LOCATION	; a fourth , by the way , also a grandnephew of
M. Stapfer	PERSON	, having fallen since the pamphlet was pub - lished , `` to those who have disappeared and to those still living . ''

		The case of
Baoul Allier	ORGANIZATION	is very similar .

		Professor at the
Paris Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, and a clergyman by profession ,
M. Allier	PERSON	was invited by the Protestant boys of the capital , to-day too young to go to the front but who may be called there to-morrow , to deliver before them a series of sermons or lectures
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 363 -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: `` Foi et Vie , '' 30 centimes each -RRB- .

		In the letter asking for the sermons , I inquired after
M. Allier	PERSON	's fine son , an Alpinist , whom I have seen grow up from boyhood , and whom the people in the streets would turn and ad - mire as he went by in his jaunty uniform well set off by a graceful carriage and superb physique .

		The father sent me the lectures , and then added simply , at the very end of his letter : `` As for
Roger	PERSON	, he disappeared on
August 27 , 1914	DATE	, and we have had no news from him since . ''

		One may imagine the soul j put into these addresses delivered before ; youths but a little younger than his own boy , ' many of whom are destined to `` disappear '' in a similar manner if this dreadful holocaust continues another year .

		And the same note of suppressed anguish is breathed in the Belgian war books , only j two of which , however , I can find room to I mention here .

		`` En Italic avant la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	et Bruxelles note this second city on the title-page
Van Oest	PERSON	, 2 frs .

		50 -RRB- , and `` Les Socialistes et la Guerre Europeenne '' the same publisher and price , and the title j sufficiently describes the contents are both I by a distinguished Belgian orator and socialist ; deputy ,
M. Jules Destree	PERSON	.

		This is the dedica - j tion of the first of these volumes : `` To
M. Lorand	PERSON	, Liberal Deputy of
Viton	LOCATION	, and
M. j Melot	PERSON	, Catholic Deputy of
Namur	LOCATION	, their j socialist colleague of
Charleroi	LOCATION	, in memory of | a time when party distinctions disappear before the common desire to defend the out - j raged Commonwealth . ''

		Nor should this state - j ment in
Maeterlinck	LOCATION	's preface to the volume be overlooked , that the landlords of the hotel where the poet and the orator -LRB- `` a ; formidable orator , '' the former styles the latter -RRB- put up during their tour stating the Belgian case and , indirectly , discreetly push - ing
Italy	LOCATION	towards hostilities , all refused pay , and even the servants declined the traditional pourboire , a good example of that indescrib - able and often unexpected sentimentality of the Latins .

		The
Paris	LOCATION	university world has also been doing some excellent work in influencing foreign public opinion , by editing and issuing a very able series of pamphlets under the general title of `` Etudes et Documents sur la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Colin , 50 centimes each -RRB- .

		The aim and spirit of these nine or ten opus - cules is well set forth in this extract from a letter of the secretary of the committee of professors who have the work in charge , Professor
Emile Durkheim	PERSON	, who fills the chair of philosophy at the Sorbonne : Our purpose has been to counteract the propaganda of the Germans among the neutral nations , but by employing a method quite different from that em - ployed by the Germans .

		In this propaganda work we remain to-day what we were in time of peace , savants , historians , sociologists , jurists , etc. .

		Our pur - pose has been to fix certain aspects of the war by giving to our work all the objectivity of which we are capable .

		There were subjects which we decided not to touch upon , though the newspapers do not hesitate to treat them , because it seemed to us that we could not establish objectively the wrong-doings of the Germans in these particular cases .

		But we still had left a sufficient number of subjects for treatment !

		And now , after having scattered a hundred thousand of these pamphlets , translated into a half dozen modern tongues , in all parts of the world , this same committee is turning its attention `` to home propaganda , our object at present being to give our French people a true picture of the military and economic situation of the belligerents , again leaving to one side the purely political events of the day . ''

		These `` Lettres a Tous les Franais , '' furnished gratis by
Colin	PERSON	, the publisher just mentioned , embrace `` Patience , Effort , Con - fidence , '' by Professor
Durkheim	PERSON	; `` La Paix que les Allemands Voudraient Faire , '' by Professor
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	, the historian and head of the
Superior Normal School	ORGANIZATION	; and `` Le Bloc des Alliances , '' by Professor
Ernest Denis	PERSON	, of the
Paris University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other university professors who contribute conspicuous books , pamphlets , or essays to the question of the hour are
M. Jacques Flach	PERSON	, the French jurist who has written much on Cujas and
Jonathan Swift	PERSON	, and who is a mem - ber of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	and professor at the College of
France	LOCATION	, `` Le
Droit de la Force	ORGANIZATION	et la Force du Droit '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Recueil Sirey , 1 fr .

		50 -RRB- ; a high-keyed lecture delivered in one of the

Toulouse Law School	ORGANIZATION	, - `` Les Forces de la
France	LOCATION	d'Hier et de Demain '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Recueil Sirey , 3 frs . -RRB-

		, six lectures delivered
last April	DATE	at
Madrid	LOCATION	, the author 's chief aim being to combat the idea prevailing abroad that this war has brought out a new
France	LOCATION	, whereas we simply see `` the old
France	LOCATION	to which foreigners had shut their eyes '' ;
M. Eugene d'Eichthal	PERSON	, member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	and director of the well known school in the Rue Saint
Guillaume	PERSON	, `` Kant et la Guerre , '' `` Des Evaluations du Cout de la Guerre , '' and `` Apres
Douze	PERSON	Mois de Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	, 50 centimes each -RRB- , three essays which are worthy of particular attention because of the subjects treated and because of the high position of the author in the economic and educational circles of
Paris	LOCATION	;
M. Paul Seippel	PERSON	, professor at the
Zurich Polytechnic School	ORGANIZATION	, `` La Defense de notre Independance Intellectuelle '' -LRB-
Zurich	LOCATION	:
Orell Fiissli	PERSON	, 25 centimes -RRB- , an excellent presentation by an able neutral of the difficult position of ,364 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	troubled
Switzerland	LOCATION	in the present conflict ; and
M. Joseph Barthelemy	PERSON	, professor at the
Paris Law School	ORGANIZATION	, `` Les Institutions Politiques de 1 ` Allemagne Contemporaine '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- .

		The author of this last-named book should not be con - founded , as often happens , with Professor
Henri Berthelemy	PERSON	, also of the
Paris Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity and who also writes on questions of public law .

		As a young man
Joseph Barthelemy	PERSON	studied at
Bonn	LOCATION	,
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		`` I was especially attracted by Professor
Jellinek	PERSON	, '' he once said to me , `` and I think I know well enough German political science to enjoy the right of not having to admire it . ''

		The aim of the book is to show that real political liberty is unknown in Ger - many `` the accentuation of the anti-parlia - mentary regime under
Herr von Bethmann	PERSON	-
Hollweg	PERSON	can not be questioned '' and hence the cause of danger to the rest of the world .

		I may add , by the way , that perhaps no other writer has been so often `` crowned '' by the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Barthelemy	PERSON	having been six times a `` laureate '' of the
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mention of Professor
Seippel	PERSON	and of
Zurich	LOCATION	reminds me of the splendid part which the Swiss people in general has been playing in this terrible catastrophe .

		A single example will suffice .

		`` Le Passage des Rapatries Frahcais a
Zurich	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Bale :
Nouvelle Librairie Litterarie	PERSON	, 3 frs . -RRB-

		is a collection of photo - graphs of those forlorn French men , women , and children who , torn from the invaded regions of
France	LOCATION	by the Germans , are now , provisions becoming scarce , sent back to their desolate homes , where they should have been left in the first place .

		There are fifty pages of these photographs , generally four to the page , taken by different members of the `` Comite des Rapatries , '' one of the many spontaneously constituted Swiss groups that have done so much to alleviate the sufferings of their unfortunate neighbors .

		At the end of the volume , the Rev.
William Cuendet	PERSON	, presi - dent of the committee , explains in a few pathetic pages what he and his friends have accomplished .

		It is one of the tenderest epi - sodes of the present war , and it does marked credit to warm and generous Swiss philan - thropy .

		From
Switzerland	LOCATION	also comes this rather melancholy and outspoken note from
Romain Rolland	PERSON	: Freedom of speech is too limited in
France	LOCATION	just now and passions are too excited to make it possible or useful to try and make heard an independent thought .

		I have said in my published articles a * ll that I can say , for the moment , as a good Frenchman who will not , however , surrender his own reason .

		I will now wait for a more favorable hour before speaking again .

		In the meantime I observe and work in silence .

		As regards books which judge from an elevated standpoint the present crisis , without yield - ing to the passions of the day , I practically know none , except they be in manuscript , for at present it is almost impossible to get printed in the belligerent states , except in
England	LOCATION	perhaps , anything which runs counter to the current of public opinion .

		Here and there some good article appears , and now and then a book of audacious verse slips thrpugh the poets seem to be regarded as rather inoffensive and among these last is
Jouve	PERSON	's volume .

		The book referred to , by the poet
P. J. Jouve	PERSON	, `` Vous etes des Hommes '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Nouvelle Revue Frangaise , 2 frs .

		50 -RRB- , is a little collec - tion of vigorous poems suggested by the war and presented in free verse .

		The author is interesting to Americans in more ways than one .

		He is about thirty years old , and belongs to a group of young French poets , consisting of Vildrac ,
Bazalgette	LOCATION	,
Jean Richard Bloch	PERSON	, and others , who have been strongly influenced by
Walt Whitman	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` This circle , '' writes
Rolland	PERSON	, `` has best preserved during the war a spirit of equity and large humanity . ''

		Even
Walt	PERSON	's inclination towards nursing the sol - diers of our own Civil War seems to have found imitation on the part of his French disciple .

		Jouve 's health was so bad that the military authorities pronounced him unfit for active service , and he might have remained quietly at home with wife and boy .

		But he volunteered twice for duty in the hospitals , worked ' there for a year , twice fell ill , and is now at `` La Feniere , '' a villa at
Montana	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, trying to restore his shattered nerves .

		A couple of volumes of reprints from the editorial pages of two important
Paris	LOCATION	reviews deserve attention for several reasons .

		These are `` La Guerre de
1914	DATE	vue en son Gours chaque Semaine '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Delagrave , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by
M. Paul Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, the learned French political economist , editor of the weekly paper , `` L'Economiste Francais '' ; and `` L'Allemagne contre 1 `
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Perrin	LOCATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by the late
Francis Charmes	PERSON	.

		The publisher of this last-named volume informs me that it will be followed by a second which will continue the reprint of
M. Charmes	PERSON	's chroniques of the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' down to the day of his death .

		M. Leroy-Beaulieu 's volume extends from
August , 1914	DATE	, to
July , 1915	DATE	.

		In the first article he said that he thought the war , then just begun , `` could not end in less than three months ; it may , like that of
1870	DATE	, last half a year '' !

		The author tells me that the second volume will appear some time toward the end of next
summer	DATE	, and thereupon he adds : It is not likely that the war will then be finished ; so I will have a third volume devoted to the third
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 365 year of the hostilities , as the armistice and the nego - tiations will also doubtless occur in this year , and lead up to the peace , which it will take much time to bring about , on account of the number of belligerents and the enormity of the interests concerned .

		Another publication which covers the whole period of the war down to a recent date is the `` Histoire de la Guerre par le Bulletin des Armees '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, two volumes , 3 frs .

		each -RRB- .

		This is a reprint of the '' Bulletin des Armees de la Republique '' how this title savors of the heroic days of the
First Repub	ORGANIZATION	- lic !

		the little semi - weekly journal issued by the Minister of War and sent to the trenches , often the only reading matter received there for weeks at a time .

		The paper is not on sale , and this reprint is made to satisfy public curiosity to have a set of this official and yet popularly edited periodical , an interesting evidence of the fact that republican
France	LOCATION	considers the intellectual condition of her troops of the first importance .

		Very different is the series of volumes edited by the veteran
Paris	LOCATION	journalist ,
M. Gaston Jollivet	PERSON	-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 frs .

		50 each -RRB- two have already appeared and three or four are to follow , a sort of brief running account of the operations from day to day , which are a very good supplement to M ,
Joseph Reinaeh	PERSON	's `` Les Commentaires de Poly be '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Fasquelle , 4 volumes , 3 frs .

		50 each -RRB- .

		It will be remembered that the Greek historian
Polybius	PERSON	, who lived some two hundred years before our era , was a model of conciseness .

		`` I have always had a great liking for this historian , '' says the versatile author of these modern commentaries in his preface , `` who shows that in politics as in war , however much of the success may be attributed to good luck , coherency in plan and per - severance in resolution count for something , ` often producing finer effects than rashness and hazard , ' says the old Greek writer , thus predicting , it might seem , the Joffre of to-day . ''

		The appendix to the fourth volume contains some important statements concern - ing Ferdinand and the Bulgarians which are very timely at this hour .

		In this same category of books belongs '' Pages d ` Histoire '' -LRB- Nancy : Berger-Levrault , prices varying from 30 to 90 centimes accord - ing to the size of the pamphlet -RRB- .

		This col - lection , which now numbers over a hundred separate pamphlets , is edited by
M. Robert Steinheil	PERSON	, of the firm which publishes it , and is sent in large quantities to the front .

		Here will be found the remarkable article by
M. Emile Boutroux	PERSON	, on the perversion of the grand soul of the old
Germany	LOCATION	which we all loved and admired , which article first ap - peared in the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' ;
M. Salomon Reinaeh	PERSON	's `` Voix Amerieaines '' ; `` Les Poetes de la Guerre , '' giving verses by
Jean Aicard	PERSON	,
Francois Fabie	PERSON	,
Paul Fort	PERSON	,
Rostand	PERSON	, etc. ; `` Les Volontaires Etrangers , '' where our American young men who have taken up arms for
France	LOCATION	receive due praise ; and `` Chants de Soldat '' -LRB- 1525-1915 -RRB- , including the national airs of the allies .

		But a more important volume devoted to soldiers ' songs is `` Chansons pour les Poilus '' -LRB- Nancy : Berger-Levrault , 2 frs .

		50 -RRB- , written by
M. Andre Alexandre	PERSON	, poet , dramatist `` Madame Chrysantheme '' is his work and prolific song-writer .

		In a preface to the vol - ume , the well known
Paris	LOCATION	lawyer ,
M. Henri Robert	PERSON	, deservedly praises both these songs and their author .

		Nor does the attention of the French Gov - ernment and French writers and artists for the well-being of their soldiers stop with intel - lectual and more material comforts . ''

		Conseils au Soldat pour sa Sante '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Wellhoff & Roche	ORGANIZATION	, 50 centimes -RRB- is a pamphlet issued by the
Health Bureau of the War Office	ORGANIZATION	and intended as a sanitary guide for the common soldier .

		It is an admirable little publication , and must be doing a world of good in the ranks .

		Even the elite directories reflect the prevail - ing spirit .

		One of the oldest of these it has been appearing for over thirty years and one of the best , `` Tout
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: 55
Chaussee d'Antin	PERSON	, 12 frs . -RRB-

		, prints in heavy - faced type the names of the young men and officers of
Paris	LOCATION	fashionable life who have fallen in battle .

		The roll is a long one , and the grandest families of historic , literary , and artistic
France	LOCATION	are represented in it .

		At the end of the volume is a list with the caption , `` Honneur et Patrie , '' giving not only the names of those `` mentioned in dispatches '' or decorated , but printing the official statement of why they were so honored .

		Here again the catalogue is lengthy and brilliant .

		Perhaps the best collection in
France	LOCATION	of everything pertaining to the present war books , maps , reviews , pamphlets , newspaper - clippings , etc. , is to be found in the `` Bibliotheque de la Guerre '' of the
Lyons Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The librarian writes me that they have correspondents in all parts of the world , exclusive of the diplomatic and con - sular representatives of
France	LOCATION	, who are also helping .

		A special catalogue is now being drawn up .

		Senator
Herriot	PERSON	, the mayor of
Lyons	PERSON	, a man of much intellectual and literary polish , is the soul of the whole enterprise .

		THE WHEREFORE OF FREE VERSE is set forth with some ingenuity , even if not with entire persuasiveness , by Mr.
Edward Storer	PERSON	in `` The New Republic . ''

		He holds that `` a poet who wishes to give expression to realities in modern life will find in practice that he is confined for his literary expression to the two media of prose and free verse '' ; and the reason of this is that the regular , rhythmical form in which so much of poetic feeling in the past has found expression owes its being to the religious impulse .

		As these older metrical schemes `` lost the primitive force that created them , they also lost their meaning , or a part of their meaning , '' and it is now `` impossible in using them to produce more than a theatrical effect . ''

		They may still serve the purposes of amusement , of dilettante literary exercises ; but for the adequate utterance of `` modern truths , there are the great formless - nesses , the dissipating molten matter of speech , the possibilities of language . ''

		So far , Mr.
Storer	PERSON	.

		In reply one might ask whether the religious impulse no longer stirs in human breasts , whether the emotion of awe and reverence in the face of the mystery of existence and the wonders of creation has become a thing of the past .

		And what has poetry , any more than any other art , to do with `` formlessnesses '' except to reduce them to form ?

		The poet , etymologically and in the common understanding of the word , is a maker , a fashioner , not a dealer in `` great formlessnesses '' or `` molten matter . ''

		One need go no further than the nursery to learn , from the instinctive use of rhyme and metre there , that these regular rhythms , believed by Mr.
Storer	PERSON	to belong to a past age , are as much of the present time as is the measured beat of our pulse , or the regular alternation of inhala - tion and exhalation .

		The ripple of the ocean waves , the breaking of the surf on the sea - shore , the swing of the planets in their orbits these and countless other examples of the rhythm that pervades all nature refute the doctrine that the day of regular rhythms has passed .

		PRESIDENT
ANGELL	PERSON	'S BREADTH OF CULTURE was the natural result , the earned reward , of his labors in many fields , educational , literary , journalistic , editorial , administrative , and diplomatic .

		At his death on the first day of this month , in his eighty-eighth year , he had been for more than six years president emeritus of
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, after holding the presidency thirty-eight years , before which he had been president of the
University of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	, and had held a profes - sorship at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, of which he was a graduate .

		He had also been
United States Minister	LOCATION	to
China	LOCATION	, had received the appoint - ment to a like post at
Constantinople	LOCATION	, but had soon resigned , had served on two important national commissions , had been a member of the board of regents of the
Smithsonian Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution , and had , earlier in life , edited the
Providence	LOCATION	`` Journal '' for six or seven years .

		Agricultural experience on the home ` farm , studies abroad , the exercise of his pen in authorship , and of his voice on the public plat - form , with a number of other activities , had contributed in their several ways to his devel - opment .

		In literature his most generally interesting work is his modest volume of `` Reminiscences , '' published four years ago , while his more scholarly side is shown in his earlier works , `` Progress in International Law '' and `` The Higher Education . ''

		Maga - zine articles , lectures , and other short pieces have come from his pen in some abundance .

		His story of his own life , above referred to , has many a genial touch .

		No good and per - tinent anecdote comes amiss with its author .

		He illustrates the German love of thorough - ness , the
Deutsche Grundlichkeit	ORGANIZATION	, by a brief reference to the literary methods of an author and antiquary with whom he had become acquainted in
Braunschweig	LOCATION	.

		This man made a study of the coats-of-arms of the Brunswick chimneys , and wrote a book about them , a `` History of the Chimneys of Brunswick , '' in which , for the sake of thoroughness , he first went back to the chimneys of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, but became convinced , after pains - taking research , that the Greeks and Romans had no chimneys ; accordingly the first part of his treatise turned out to be a laborious dissertation on the nonexistent chimneys of a chimneyless people .

		This autobiography of the late
James Burrill Angell	PERSON	is , in its way , a notable little book , and a highly readable one .

		PROBLEMS IN BOOKSELLING have from the first exercised the wits of those engaged in this trade .

		As early as
1471	DATE	certain printers of the Latin classics in
Rome	LOCATION	found themselves so embarrassed by the difficulty of getting their wares into the hands of those for whom they were intended , and who unquestionably desired them , that these printers appealed to the Pope for assistance .

		It was the same problem that still perplexes , how to bring the book and its buyer most expeditiously and unfailingly together , at a minimum expense .

		Probably not even papal infallibility was equal to the exigencies of the case .

		This inci - dent is referred to by Mr.
Joseph Shaylor	PERSON	, a
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 367 veteran of the English bookselling trade , in `` Some Thoughts on Bookselling , '' published in a recent issue of `` The Publishers '
Circu	PERSON	- lar '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , though originally prepared for oral presentation before a convention of the
Associated Booksellers	ORGANIZATION	that failed to con - vene by reason of disorganization caused by the war .

		He writes at some length and with complete understanding of the questions dis - cussed .

		In a concluding summary he em - phasizes three of these questions : first , he believes that books by untried authors , works in the purchase of which the dealer incurs more than the ordinary risk , should be return - able to the publishers within six months ; secondly , the publisher should make a plain distinction between books in which he is finan - cially concerned and those which he issues at the author 's expense ; and thirdly , he should always fix his terms and adhere to them with both wholesale and retail dealer , and the rates of discount to these dealers should be per - manently established and strictly observed by all publishers , acting in harmony .

		In general , it is organization and cooperation that are lacking among publishers the world over .

		How to effect these is a great problem , and its magnitude becomes apparent when one bears in mind that the world 's annual output of books amounts to nearly 175,000 separate works , or did before the present relapse into barbarism .

		A COLLEGIAN 'S DIARY that gives glimpses of
Longfellow	LOCATION	as lecturer , of
Lowell	LOCATION	as student , of
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	and
Felton	PERSON	and
E. T. Charming	ORGANIZATION	in their several chairs of instruction , and of other notables of the time and place , is likely to be interesting reading ; and when the diarist himself chances to be no less a per - sonage than the author of `` The Man without a Country , '' this likelihood becomes a virtual certainty .

		Professor
Edward E. Hale	PERSON	has edited for the
April	DATE	number of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly '' some selections from his father 's journal of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	life in the thirties of
last century	DATE	.

		The first entry bears date of Janu - ary ,
1837	DATE	, when the writer was half-way through his sophomore year , though not yet quite fifteen years old .

		Here is a passage , unintentionally smile-provoking at the end : `` We recited in German for the first time to Professor
Longfellow	PERSON	.

		The recitation , or rather the exercise , for we had no lesson set before , was very easy .

		I think we shall like the study very much . ''

		Some months later : `` At 11 A. M. went to Professor
Longfellow	PERSON	's first lecture on
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's
Faust	LOCATION	, The lectures are to be extemporaneous translations of the German with explanations ; as he called it recitations in which he recites and we hear .

		He made a long introduction to the matter in hand very flowery and bombastic indeed , which appeared to me very much out of taste .

		I believe , however , that it was entirely extem - poraneous and that he was carried away by the current of his thoughts .

		In fact , he appears to say just what comes uppermost .

		The regular translation and explanation part of the lecture was very good . ''

		A later entry records the writer 's decision not to attend the lectures on the second part of
Faust	LOCATION	, a volun - tary course .

		`` The lectures are tolerably interesting , but not enough so to compensate for the time taken up by them . ''

		Still later he `` went to Professor
Longfellow	PERSON	's introductory lecture on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much to my delight , he rather advised those who had not finished the Ital .

		course not to attend till next year , which advice I shall follow . ''

		There is record of an `` exhibition , '' in which , says the diarist , `` I liked
Jim Lowell	PERSON	's part better than any of the others . ''

		Interesting , in a different man - ner from these jottings , is the facsimile of student Bale 's college bill for one term .

		Tuition is
$ 25.00	MONEY	; rent and care of room ,
$ 5.00	MONEY	; special repairs ,
$ 0.57	MONEY	; fuel ,
$ 2.75	MONEY	; board ,
$ 28.60	MONEY	.

		Total ,
$ 61.92	MONEY	.


IRVINGTON	LOCATION	'S INFANT LIBRARY has passed its first birthday -LRB- or should one say its second , counting the day on which it was born as its first ? -RRB-

		and issued its `` First Annual Eeport . ''

		It is
Irvington	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, not Irvington-on -
Hudson	LOCATION	, that is here meant .

		The
New Jersey Irvington	LOCATION	is much the larger of the two , having nearly or quite twelve thousand inhabitants , and the wonder is that it has not sooner acquired a public library .

		Perhaps this may be partly explained by its proximity to the excellent institution that has made
Newark	LOCATION	famous in the library world .

		At any rate , it now has `` a live , growing collection of books '' of its own , numbering 3,569 at last accounts , presumably a building in which to keep them , and certainly a librarian ,
Miss May E. Baillet	PERSON	, to promote their usefulness and report upon their circulation , growth , and other kindred matters .

		Moreover , it has a board of seven trustees , including a mayor who answers to the fortunately ominous name of Glorieux .

		Under lucky auspices does the
Irvington	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library enter upon its second year of existence .

		THE ALLIANCE OP THE AMERICAS SCCmS to hang in the balance for the moment , awaiting the action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the
Colombia	LOCATION	matter , and the outcome of our military expedition into
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile , it is perhaps worth while to draw attention to an interesting arti - 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	ele in the `` Review
Cuba	LOCATION	Contemporanea , '' entitled `` The Races in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is writ - ten by Dr.
Jose Ingenieros	PERSON	, but sets forth the views of the distinguished Argentine sociol - ogist ,
Sefior Domingo F. Sarmiento	PERSON	.

		The paper 's aim may be summed up in one sen - tence of the article : to construct , with all the poor and weak nations of
South America	LOCATION	, a grand and strong modern nation , after the type of that of the North , their constant model .

		Such a generous tribute from such a source shows that the two races and two continents are approaching each other .

		On neither side does `` ignorance make a barren waste of all beyond itself . ''

		Another article in the same review , on `` The Spirit of Liberty in the Poetry of Dominicana , '' will be a revela - tion to those who might have been in doubt whether either liberty or poetry existed in that island .

		In
Cuba	LOCATION	itself there is certainly an intellectual revival .

		We hope that this may be in some measure due to the action of the
United States	LOCATION	in interfering to secure its freedom .

		From
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	comes a stout volume as a memorial of the foundation and first year of `` El Ateneo , '' an association of writers and artists of various kinds , appar - ently somewhat after the order of the old Italian Academy .

		Its purpose is to promote the arts , judge works , award prizes , and so forth .

		It has an imposing list of committees for the various sections , Literature , Philos - ophy , Music , Plastic Arts , and many others .

		` That its work is well done may be attested by a volume of addresses on
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, And
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, put forth by its Director , the poet .

		and critic ,
Max Henriquez Urena	PERSON	.

		THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE THE SHAKE - SPEARE TERCENTENARY , or one of the best `` ways , is pointed out by Mr.
Charles D. ; Stewart	PERSON	in the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' for
March	DATE	, a Shakespeare number in certain of its features .

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's wise and prac - ticable suggestion is that we observe this three-hundredth recurrence of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death-day -LRB- our word , not Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's -RRB- by reading one or two of his plays and trying to become really acquainted with him .

		`` Take a play that has not been staled by everyday quotation and which has not been made tire - some by being ` studied ' in school .

		Then , declaring your independence of all scholars and commentators , and throwing aside all help except an occasional reference to the glossary , sit down to get out of his work the one great thing that is in it namely human nature .

		Aside from his wonderful power of expression , which will take care of itself , this is the thing which makes Shakespeare ; and on that basis you can meet him directly and on your own ground .

		If you have been through the world 's mill to any purpose you may get more out of him , and be able to tell more about him , than even the most learned and cloistered commentator . ''

		A good play to select for this reading , and one that has not yet been read and `` studied '' to death , would be ``
Richard II.	PERSON	, '' by some critics pronounced superior to ``
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' which has tended to eclipse it ; at any rate , it has merits enough of its own to fear no comparison with its fellows ... THE READING WITH THE MOST RELISH is likely to be that which has been secured with effort and after long waiting .

		Lamb 's ecsta - sies over an old and rare book , long coveted and at last obtained only after strict economy , are well known to readers of
Elia	LOCATION	.

		In the town of
Swanton	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, there has lately been finished a library building that owes its existence to no millionaire benefactor , nor even to any appropriation from the public funds .

		A writer in the `` Bulletin of the Ver - mont Free Public Library Commission '' announces with pride that `` the peculiar distinction of the
Swanton	LOCATION	library resides in the fact that it is in the completest sense a community possession . ''

		King 's Daughters , churches and schools , boys and girls , men and women , all have worked together to make the library , long a desirabil - ity , an actuality ; and now they one and all feel a peculiar sense of proprietorship , which augurs well for the future usefulness of this work of their hands .

		The lot of land on which the building stands was originally granted by
George III	PERSON	.

		`` to his loving subjects of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, '' and its subsequent changes of ownership , down to the benefactor who gave it to the town for its present use , have been traced ... A MUTUAL INFORMATION SOCIETY is nOW in process of organization under the direction -LRB- in
America	LOCATION	, at least -RRB- of Mr.
Eugene F. McPike	PERSON	.

		It is to be called the
International Society for Intercommunication	ORGANIZATION	, and is to be `` devoted to the promotion of ways and means to facilitate the interchange of useful informa - tion . ''

		An `` official organ '' will be published monthly and will be sent to all members , the members themselves to constitute the staff of contributors .

		With the magazine will go a list of members , with their addresses and an indi - cation of their individual pursuits or chosen departments of study .

		Thus every member will be brought , if he wishes it , into ready communication with every other member interested in the same topics or researches as
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 369 himself .

		`` The
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	, '' we learn from the prospectus , `` will be composed of residents of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, and other portions of
North America	LOCATION	where the English language is used and understood . ''

		Passive membership , as well as active , will be permitted , and those simply desiring to for - ward the good cause in a material sense may pay their annual fee and remain anonymous on the list of members .

		But of course it is hoped that most participants in the enterprise will be information-seekers and information - givers , enlarging the bounds of human knowl - edge and diminishing the scope of human ignorance .

		The fee for membership is three dollars a year , or half that amount for six months , and is payable to Mr.
Eugene F. McPike	PERSON	, Acting Secretary and Treasurer of the
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	,

		* * COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND POLICE has for some time been attempted in a novel way and apparently with good results in one of the cities of the state whose public-library system is the most nearly complete of any in
America	LOCATION	.

		Only one town in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	is without its public library , and this town -LRB-
Newbury	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- enjoys the use of a neighboring library for a proper consideration .

		But to return to our starting-point : in the city of
Somerville	LOCATION	, a suburb of
Boston	LOCATION	, boy offenders placed on probation by the police court are required to report at stated times to the pro- bation officer at the library , not , as heretofore , at the police court .

		Every such youthful offender is made to draw from the library a book with a story bearing on the offence of which he is guilty and pointing a moral , and , what is more , the boy is subsequently called upon for proof that he has read the prescribed matter .

		Close cooperation between the court , the police , and the library is producing what seem to be encouraging results .

		Here , then , .

		The lankness of her long figure showed in the calico wrapper which seemed her sole gar - ment ; and her large features were respectively lank in their way , nose and chin and high cheek-bones ; her eyes wabbled in their sockets with the sort of inquiring laughter that spread her wide , loose mouth .

		At the time of Mr.

		Now it is proposed to erect a structure that will both serve the needs of the fine

		SOME RECENTLY DISCOVERED POEMS BY WALT WHITMAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I be allowed space in your columns to announce , for the benefit of students of the poetry of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, the recent discovery of a num - ber of his early poems ?

		Of all the verse which Whitman must have written before he produced , at the age of thirty-six , that prodigy of poetry , the
First Edition	ORGANIZATION	of `` Leaves of Grass , '' he has preserved but four poems , and the diligence of his biographers has unearthed only as many more .

		370 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	In the ``
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Daily Eagle '' there appeared in
1846	DATE	, when Whitman was editor of the paper , two poems : `` The Play-Ground , '' a descriptive poem , and an '' Ode to be sung on
Fort Greene	LOCATION	;
4th of July , 1846	DATE	. ''

		Ten others have been found in an imperfect file of the `` Long Island Demo - crat , '' recently rescued from an old garret .

		It appears that in the year
1840	DATE	, Whitman was teaching school in , or near ,
Jamaica	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, a village which has since been incorporated in the
Borough of Queens	LOCATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	.

		He boarded , for over a year , with a certain
James J. Brenton	PERSON	, who afterwards -LRB- 1850 -RRB- included in his `` Voices from the Press '' one of Whitman 's early sketches called `` Tomb Blossoms . ''

		Mr.
Brenton	PERSON	was the editor and publisher of the `` Long Island Demo - crat , '' in the office of which , after school hours , Whitman worked as a compositor .

		To this paper Whitman contributed , with fair regularity , one piece of verse each month .

		The tone of most of these poems is meditative , if not morbid , a common theme being the vanity of life and the peacefulness of death .

		Even one which is ostensibly a continuation of the well known ballad , `` Father
Grimes	PERSON	, '' soon loses the jest in the sermon .

		But all show conscientious experi - mentation in various verse forms , and indicate an increasing mastery of form and phrasing .

		A list of the titles will give some idea of what the youth of twenty or so was meditating about in the days when his only readers were the subscribers to a village paper : ``
Young Grimes	PERSON	, '' `` Fame 's Van - ity '' -LRB- the original form of the autobiographical `` Ambition '' -RRB- , `` My Departure '' -LRB- the original of `` Death of a Nature Lover '' -RRB- , `` The Inca 's Daughter , '' `` The Love that is Hereafter , '' `` We Shall Rest at Last '' -LRB- the original of `` Each Has His Grief '' -RRB- , `` The Spanish Lady , '' `` The End of All , '' `` The Columbian 's Song '' -LRB- a patriotic ode -RRB- , and `` The Winding-Up '' -LRB- a revision of `` The End of All '' -RRB- .

		When a more scientific study of Whitman 's early life and writings than has hitherto been possible is made , these accidentally preserved `` efforts '' will prove of considerable importance .

		THE SOUECES OF
WILLIAM VAUGHN	PERSON	MOODY 'S `` THAMMUZ . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I daresay that most readers of
William Vaughn Moody	ORGANIZATION	's poetry are puzzled by his `` Thammuz . ''

		In four stanzas the poet embodies his conception of life as a fusion of religious mysticism and pagan joy .

		His sources are
the Bible	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	PERSON	, the myth of Orpheus , and
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		In his ode `` On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity , ''
Milton	PERSON	writes -LRB- line 204 -RRB- : In vain the Tyrian maids their Thammuz mourn , while at line 460 of `` Paradise Lost '' he expands ``
Ezekiel '' VIII	PERSON	, 14 , as follows : Thammuz came next behind , Whose annual wound in
Lebanon	LOCATION	allured The Syrian damsels to lament his fate In amorous ditties all a
summer	DATE	's day , While smooth Adonis from his native rock Kan purple to the sea , supposed with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded : the love-tale Infected Sion 's daughters with like heat , Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
Ezekiel	PERSON	saw , when , by the vision led , His eye surveyed the dark idolatries Of alienated
Judah	PERSON	.

		In his edition of
Milton	ORGANIZATION	's poems -LRB- `` Cambridge Edition , '' 1899 -RRB- , page 395 ,
Moody	ORGANIZATION	has the follow - ing note on
Milton	PERSON	's `` Thammuz '' : `` An important figure in Phoenician mythology .

		He was slain by a boar in
Lebanon	LOCATION	, but comes to life each
spring	DATE	, his death and resuscitation symbolizing the destruc - tive forces of
winter	DATE	and the quickening forces of
spring	DATE	.

		When the river Adonis became red - dened by the mud brought down from
Lebanon	LOCATION	by the
spring	DATE	torrents , it was believed to be the flowing afresh of
Thammuz	ORGANIZATION	's wounds which caused the change of color . ''

		In
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's `` Thammuz '' the god is represented as killed by frenzied women .

		This conception is not innate in the
Thammuz	LOCATION	- Adonis myth , so
Moody	ORGANIZATION	effected a combination of the Orpheus story , in which love-maddened nymphs slay the hapless singer , and of the `` Bacchae '' of Euripides , in which women crazed by
Dionysus	ORGANIZATION	tear Pentheus to pieces .

		I now venture to quote `` Thammuz '' entire : Daughters , daughters , do ye grieve ?

		Crimson dark the freshes flow !

		Were ye violent at eve ?

		Crimson stains where the rushes grow !

		What is this that I must know ?

		Mourners by the dark red waters , Met ye Thammuz at his play ?

		Was your mood upon you , daughters ?

		Had ye drunken ?

		O how grey Looks your hair in the rising day !

		Mourners , mourn not overmuch That ye slew your lovely one .

		Such ye are ; and be ye such !

		Lift your heads ; the waters run Euby bright in the climbing sun .

		Eaven hair and hair of gold , Look who bendeth over you !

		This is not the shepherd old ; This is Thammuz , whom ye slew ,
Kadiant Thammuz	PERSON	, risen anew !

		`` FEEE VEESE '' DEFINED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Members of the
Poetry Society of America	ORGANIZATION	have been much concerned of late because nobody could seem to hit upon a satisfactory definition of vers libre or free verse .

		Having observed this contest for some time , and noted the anguish of mind into which this question has thrown some of our temperamental singers , I can no longer bear to let them suffer , and hence come forward to suggest the following : `` Free verse is verse which can not be sold and which must , therefore , be given away . ''

New York	LOCATION	,

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 371 THE POETRY OF IJIOXEL , JOHXSOK .

		We have all been reading lately the verse and travel letters of a young English poet whom death has set apart from his fellows and anticipated in his favor the verdict of posterity .

		It is startling to reflect how long he might have waited for the fame which is now his , and rightly his , had not death silenced him forever .

		Yet it seems clear , as clear as such things can ever be , that the verdict is a just one , and that
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	's niche in the
House of Fame	ORGANIZATION	is secure .

		Be - tween him and
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	a comparison is all but inevitable .

		Both were public school and university men , representing , therefore , much the same social and literary tradition ; both early gave proof of a notable poetic gift ; and the fame of both rests solely upon the first fruits of their genius ; for , though
John	PERSON	- son lived to be thirty-five , the greater part of his verse was written , like
Brooke	PERSON	's , before he was twenty-six .

		Their very portraits invite comparison and , at the same time , suggest the essential difference in their poetic quality .

		Brooke is the spirit of adventure incarnate , with every sense alert for what life may offer ; while in
Johnson	PERSON	's steady eyes and quiet mouth there is the look of one to whom the world is not a pageant but a problem , the solution of which he does not expect to find in what he hears and sees .

		The one face is vivid , winning , richly human ; the other is grave , reflective , even a little chilling , notwithstand - ing its youthful charm .

		And this contrast is more than superficial .

		In
Johnson	PERSON	we miss the richness , the vehemence , the triumphant accent of the young soldier-poet 's utterance ; the will to live is less clamorous in his verse .

		On the other hand , there is a meditative wisdom , a sober contemplation of the mys - teries of life , that the younger poet , in his haste to be about the business of living , did not pause to achieve .

		There are , of course , diversities of poetic as truly as of spiritual gifts , but `` the one Spirit 's plastic stress '' is urgent in them all .

		Of the genuineness of
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	's gift there can be no doubt .

		His technique to speak first of its external aspect is well-nigh flawless .

		He sometimes reminds us of
Arnold	LOCATION	, whom he sincerely admired and perhaps imi - tated ; but at his best and dealing with a sympathetic theme , he often reaches a degree and kind of beauty at which
Arnold	PERSON	did not * POETICAL WORKS OF
LIONEL JOHNSON	PERSON	.

		even aim .

		While the piercing tenderness and pathos of the elder poet are almost never found in the younger
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's `` sad lucid - ity of soul '' is , of course , quite beyond him yet the melody of his verse , its subtle ordering of vowel and consonant , its delicate adjust - ment of pause , its lingering beauty of cadence are not to be found in
Arnold	LOCATION	except in his happiest moments .

		The following stanzas are of his twentieth year and show that in the technique of meditative verse , at all events , he had little to learn : Ah !

		fair lips hushed in death !

		Now their glad breath Breathes not upon our air Music , that saith Love only , and things fair .

		Ah !

		lost brother !

		Ah !

		sweet Still hands and feet !

		May those feet haste to reach , Those hands to greet Us where love needs no speech .

		The curiously effective pause upon the first syllables of certain lines is highly character - istic ; the short line , too , is a favorite with I him , and some of his most admirable verse - forms are built upon it .

		He may well have got a hint of its possibilities from
Arnold	LOCATION	, though he uses it in so different a way and produces with it effects so different .

		At all events such stanzas as the following sound pleasantly upon the ear of the lover of
Arnold	LOCATION	's verse : I , living with delight This rich autumnal day , Mark the gulls ' curving flight Across the black-girt bay .

		Winds rush and waters roll : Their strength , their beauty brings Into mine heart the whole Magnificence of things .

		It is not
Arnold	LOCATION	's music , yet in imagery , mood , and melody the poem from which these lines are taken is subtly reminiscent of ``
Obermann	PERSON	. ''

		Probably it is the poet 's spiritual kinship with
Arnold	PERSON	more than the movement of his verse that reminds us of him .

		Certainly there are poems in this volume that both for substance and for sound might be
Arnold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Let these stanzas from `` Lucretius '' bear witness : Thou knowest now , that life and death Are wondrous intervals : The fortunes of a fitful breath , Within the flaming walls .

		Without them , an eternal plan , Which life and death obey : Divinity , that fashions man , Its high , immortal way .

		It is evident that such verse as this might not improperly be called `` academic , '' if by academic we mean verse that is marked by fin - 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	ish rather than fire , that has no touch in it of the `` feverish rhetoric '' of a Swinburne the phrase is
Johnson	PERSON	's ; that aims not so much at expressiveness as at pure and tranquil beauty .

		And this remark is as true of its substance as of its form .

		It is academic even in the narrow sense ; that is to say , it is the verse of a man who is by training and temper a scholar , who has the scholar 's love of quiet , of old ways and old places , the scholar 's scrupulous sense of the becoming , the scholar 's reticence and ten - dency to hide his life .

		It is even , at times , bookish verse .

		The poet delights to express his gratitude to his favorites in the world of literature ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Lucretius	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Newman	PERSON	, the Brontes , to whose hold upon him many a page of his prose bears witness .

		He loved
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	with a son 's devotion , and nothing could be more admirable in its way than the poem called `` Oxford Nights , '' a descant upon the great books that had made those nights immor - tal in his memory a modern ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	varia - tion on the theme of `` II Penseroso . ''

		It is an exquisite though unconscious picture that he draws , there and elsewhere , of a boyhood and youth spent among books , rich in friendship and abounding in natural and normal plea - sure , but touched profoundly by its inter - course with the things of the mind and the soul .

		He is especially eloquent and convinc - ing , as an Oxford man should be , when he draws his subject from classical antiquity .

		`` Julian at Eleusis , '' composed in his twentieth year , is an admirably sympathetic study of the great apostate , written in a blank verse that is more reminiscent , perhaps , of Tennyson than of
Milton	LOCATION	, but that has a suave and stately beauty of its own .

		The subject is highly characteristic , for
Julian	PERSON	represents the imaginative appeal of the finer aspects of Greek religion its lofty symbolism , its eso - teric significance which has been felt by the scholar in every age .

		To a poet of the generation of
Arnold	LOCATION	, such a theme would be especially attractive .

		Unable , yet , to yield himself to the consolations of Christianity , but feeling , nevertheless , the need of a faith , an aspiration , to fill up the void of life , he looked back a little wistfully , like Arnold himself , to a religion that did not demand of man what man could not give , and that still did not ignore or evade , like the shallow phil - osophies of the day , the soul 's necessities .

		It is true that in five years he was to become a loyal and devout Catholic , yet much of his early verse is tinged with the reluctant skep - ticism that characterizes the school of
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		It is a quite different thing from the immiti - gable hostility of a Swinburne or a
Carducci	PERSON	to the Supplanter of the elder gods .

		It is quite unlike
Leopardi	LOCATION	's bitter nihilism .

		It is , of course , minor poetry minor in a sense that
Arnold	LOCATION	's is not .

		It is negative , acquiescent .

		Indeed , on occasion , except for its exquisite form , it might not unjustly be called plaintive , and
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	is never that .

		Nor is
Leopardi	LOCATION	.

		There is a passionate vitality in both that in the one case has overcome and in the other seems certain to overcome the withering effect of the years .

		Finished as it is and congenial to the spirit of its day , one can not be quite sure that
Johnson	PERSON	's verse will do so .

		Academic his verse is in still another sense .

		Its dominant note is meditation , not passion .

		It is not poetry that stirs the pulses ; its ardors are intellectual .

		It is a little remote ; it is often severe ; it leaves one , at first reading , somewhat cold .

		.

		But as one reads , the quiet felicity of the imagery , the meditative charm of the thought , the grave beauty of the phras - ing gradually take possession of the reader 's mind and rule it .

		Such verse is not an incan - tation ; it weaves no spell , unless its power , continually exerted and continually renewed , upon the reader 's reluctance , be a spell of the most magical sort .

		One feels its beauty , as
Pater	PERSON	says of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, only at the price of certain adjustments and renunciations ; but the beauty is there , and one 's admiration of it is the more durable for not being easily yielded .

		Little of it is devoted to the passion of love , in spite of the poet 's youth , and that little , almost without exception , is dedicated to a love that is spiritualized by distance or by death .

		There is , indeed , almost no `` human interest '' in these poems , not even that which centres in the poet himself , for he effaces himself as completely as it is possible to do in verse so entirely subjective .

		It is upon the emotion , the imagery , that our attention is fixed , not upon the poet who feels and sees .

		He seems to have no passions but the passion for
Ireland	LOCATION	and the passion for nature , and those are subject to obvious limitations .

		He writes with something like passion of the love of friends , but again it is a love that is sancti - fied by death or merged in the larger love of God .

		He is at his best in threnody , as might be expected of one in whom the care for ancient things , the memory of past joys , the piety of loved places are the food upon which his meditation lives .

		The passionate remembrances , That wake at bidding of the air : Fancies , and dreams , and fragrances , That charmed us , when they were , these determine the atmosphere of all his poetry .

		Even his feeling for nature , keen as it it , is not the characteristic poet 's rapture in
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 373 form and color and odor .

		It is rather the sense , so natural to the cultivated mind , of nature 's age-long intercourse with man .

		By his love of her he is linked with all the genera - tions , and at no time does he feel more inti - mately his kinship with humanity than when his pulses stir to beauty : Beside the tremulous , blue sea , Clear at sunset , they love to be : And they are rarely sad , but then .

		For sorrow touches them , as men , Looking upon the calm of things , That pass , and wake rememberings Of holy and of ancient awe ; The charm of immemorial Law : What we see now , the great dead saw !

		Here his divergence from
Arnold	LOCATION	is com - plete ; for the elder poet sought in nature the calmness , the order , the acceptance of prevail - ing law , which the life of man denied him .

		It is a high , austere doctrine , the gospel of nature as
Arnold	LOCATION	teaches it , a bracing and salutary discipline .

		To
Johnson	PERSON	,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	offers more ordinary consolations : the brooding quiet of a
summer	DATE	day , the `` golden music '' of the corn as it ripples in the autumn wind , the driving mists of mountain gorges , the wild exhilaration of `` the chivalries of air . ''

		Above all , in the peace and the ineffable expansion of night and the stars he finds him - self most at home ; they are best suited to his mood of sober questioning .

		It is not that his thought or his emotion lacks energy ; but the day distracts him , and only in the
night	TIME	, `` that strange and solemn thing , '' does he command them .

		Yet when the city sleeps ; When all the cries are still : The stars and heavenly deeps Work out a perfect will .

		These lines , among the most perfect that he wrote , suggest the nature of
Johnson	PERSON	's gift ; in spirit he walks alone , under the friendly stars .

		It is curiously revealing , the recur - rence of stellar imagery in his verse .

		`` The sad stars wheel , '' `` the calm still stars wane , '' the twilight is `` starred , '' `` the clear stars shake within the gleaming sea , shake and abide . ''

		The `` starry music , starry fire , high above all our voice and glare , '' are symbols of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		`` When sad night draws down , when the austere stars burn , '' he is mindful of his lost friend .

		Charles , `` the fair and fatal king , '' rides forever at
Charing Cross	ORGANIZATION	at - tended by stars .

		Xight hath fierce loveliness : clouds race Past star and still unconquered star , to herald the dawn of revolution .

		The life of the Brontes , `` children of fire , '' reminds him that From the tempest and the gloom , The stars , the fires of God , steal forth .

		i He reflects how fair must be the City of God j if `` man shall not miss the stars , nor mourn the sea . ''

		It may almost be said of him that from the depths of his sombre musings he ; comes forth , like
Dante	PERSON	, `` to behold the stars . ''

		i Though a man of books , his chief teacher has been Earth , the common mother , `` her memories , her splendors , her desires '' ; but it is `` Earth whom the vast stars crown '' that has taught him most .

		The spell which night and starlight lay upon the spirit is almost the only one which his verse is quite certain to render adequately .

		His poetical gifts are many , but among them ' is not that of commanding the reader 's mood .

		He can not , with a phrase or a line , color all the world for us , pierce us with a strange pain or a strange joy , or make us feel the spirit of a place , as
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Arnold frequently do .

		The reader is always expecting this change of mood , and there is no evident reason i why it does not happen .

		Certainly , it is not 1 an affair of many words .

		There are stanzas of a few syllables in
Verlaine	PERSON	's `` Sagesse , '' for i instance , that produce it inevitably .

		Perhaps I the reason for the lack of this gift in Johnson I is to be found in what may be called , for the lack of a better word , his reticence .

		In all that he writes , not merely in his utterances concerning the deeper things of life , but in his portrayal of a mood , in his account of some momentary effect of sea or sky upon his spirit , one feels a certain detachment , a refusal or an inability to tell the whole story , that pre - vents the reader from seeing with the poet 's eyes and feeling with the poet 's heart , and produces in him also an objective attitude that is fatal to the thrill of poetry .

		Horace 's admonition may be pressed further than he i himself cared to press it .

		If the poet wishes I us to weep , he must not only first have wept i himself , but he must also not conceal from us i too successfully the traces of his tears .

		John - son was not of those who `` publish their wist - fulness abroad '' ; and while his reticence , in a i day when reticence is not , gives to his verse a j touch of severity that is an added charm , it j does prevent that contagion of the poet 's mood | which is , after all , one of the pleasures that we have a right to expect from literature .

		Even his religious verse is marked by this curious impression of something withheld .

		It is never perfunctory , except perhaps in the Latin poems , as to which one 's judgment may i easily go astray .

		They certainly have not the I ardor and the poignancy of the best of the i great Breviary hymns ; they are too obviously `` composed , '' too evidently and laboriously put together , like bits of clever joinery .

		But the English verse has an unmistakable fervor and 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	passion ; it is vital with religious as well as poetic inspiration .

		This , of course , applies to the poems written after his reception into the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Before that , his verse has the note of uncertainty , of wistfulness , of desire for a faith beyond his reach , which is the voice of his generation ; but the Catholic poems are resonant with faith and tender with devotion .

		Nevertheless , they are not reveal - ing ; there is not in them that ring of anguish , of personal need , of mystical rapture that arrests us in the poetry of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	.

		Only three or four times in all the volume is there an expression that strikes us as a verita - ble cry from the depths ; for the rest , the lovely imagery , the exquisite music , seem to draw a veil between the poet 's innermost mind and ours .

		The same objection may be made to the verses on Irish subjects .

		They lack the note of intensity for which we listen in poetry dedicated to the hopes and sorrows of an unhappy people .

		The poem entitled `` Ire - land '' is especially disconcerting to one whose standard in such matters is determined by the fashion in which
Swinburne	PERSON	, for example , sings the woes of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It is an admirable poem , full of noble imagery , of touching asso - ciations , and of subtle music ; but the heart is not wrung by it , nor is the pulse quickened .

		Johnson himself may possibly have felt this lack in his verse , for in an essay on `` Poetry and Patriotism in
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' he genially re - bukes those who maintain that the sincerity of patriotic verse must be measured by its emotion and especially by its neglect of form .

		`` Melancholy , and sorrow , and the cry of pain , it has been said by some , are more poetical than serenity and ardor : for my part I do not believe it . ''

		Whatever may be said of the `` ardor '' of
Johnson	PERSON	's patriotic verse , .

		its serenity and its perfection of form are not to be denied .

		And , in fact , the ardor also is unquestionable .

		Not only in the Irish poems , but elsewhere , there is many a phrase and half-line which shows that his heart is `` still in the far , fair Gaelic places , '' that the voice of `` desolate
Cornwall	LOCATION	, desolate Brittany '' is ever in his ears .

		Lovely and loved , O passionate land !

		Dear Celtic land , unconquered still !

		Thy mountain strength prevails : Thy winds have all their will .

		They have no care for meaner things , They have no scorn for brooding dreams : A spirit in them sings , A light about them beams .

		Here is the immortal charm of Celtic lands to every man who is capable of ' imagination their unconquerable poetry , the light of another world that lies upon them , their native hospitality to dreams .

		But the Celtic spirit has another side , and in this , too , the poet shares .

		`` They went forth to war , but they always fell , '' says an Irish bard of the heroes of his race .

		It is of the glory and sadness of lost causes that such poets as
Johnson	PERSON	most care to sing ; but the fighting came first , and in
Johnson	LOCATION	, too , beneath all his pensive brood - ing upon things that were , there was the stuff of a fighter .

		Certainly `` The Coming of War '' and `` Dawn of Revolution '' are martial and resonant enough to satisfy his countrymen , even at this hour .

		In words that curiously anticipate
Brooke	PERSON	's well-known lines , he ac - knowledges his debt to the earth that bore him and welcomes the opportunity to pay it : Earth cried to us , that all her laboured store Was ours : that she had more to give , and more : For nothing , did we deem ?

		We give her back the glory of this hour O sun and earth !

		O strength and beauty !

		We use you now , we thank you now : our duty We stand to do , mailed in your power .

		It is difficult to account , in verse so personal as
Johnson	PERSON	's , for the reader 's curious sense of something wanting , for the lack of that thrill of intensity which one often feels in the work of poets much less gifted .

		Why , when the fuel is heaped so skilfully upon the altar , does the fire from heaven not descend to kindle it ?

		Is the verse a little cold and remote be - cause the poet did not really feel intensely ; or is it because his fear of undue expansive - ness forbade him to speak out ?

		Or , finally , is it the result of an instinct that told him that man prizes most highly , in literature as else - where , those satisfactions which have not been gained without much effort , in which he has been obliged to cooperate ?

		Notwithstanding
Wordsworth	PERSON	's doctrine of `` emotion recol - lected in tranquility , '' is it quite certain that emotion which can be hoarded and meditated and transmuted was ever very keen ?

		Such emotion , no doubt , is more lasting than the intenser sort .

		It is often productive of a high order of beauty ; but we miss in it always the exaltation and the lyric rapture of more spontaneous poetry , and we miss them because they were never felt .

		After all , the enigma of
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	's verse is the enigma of his personality .

		One of his friends wrote of him after his death : `` In earlier days he had a wide circle of friends in spite of a certain reserve and aloofness of manner , which rarely left him .

		Under the mask of irony , coldness , and even perversity , which he bore in personal intercourse , lay a passionate spirit destined never to find complete utterance . ''


CHARLES H. A. WAGER	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 375 RETROSPECTS OF AX ENGLISH JOURNALIST .

		* It is chiefly his long and richly varied experience as a roving newspaper writer that the author of `` No. 5 John Street '' draws upon for the material of his reminiscent volume , `` My Harvest . ''

		This experience , be - ginning in the sixties , when the writer was in his twenties , has involved the visiting of many lands , including our own , and the meeting with innumerable persons of note , whose recorded sayings and doings help to enliven the pages of this genially discursive retro - spect .

		Incidentally the author 's philosophy of life , the motives that have actuated him , the ends he has striven for , the ideals he has cherished , are with some definiteness brought into view .

		A sort of haphazard and rather misfit edu - cation , with some years of manual training in the engraving of seals and other diminutive objects , seems to have been imposed upon the motherless and half - neglected boy who was destined to make his mark with freer stroke than that taught to him by
Benjamin Wyon	PERSON	, Chief Engraver of
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Seals .

		Evenings at the Working Men 's College under the teaching of
Maurice	ORGANIZATION	,
Kuskin	PERSON	,
Ludlow	ORGANIZATION	,
Furnivall	PERSON	, and
Hughes	PERSON	, relieved for a while the cramp of the irksome days , and a for - tunate mission to
Paris	LOCATION	in the interests of a proposed Working Class Exhibition , to be participated in by the sons of toil of the two countries ,
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, went far toward completing the emancipation .

		It is of interest to note how the radical prin - ciples inevitably imbibed by the young man amid those associates and surroundings be - came the conservative views of his maturer years .

		One has only to adhere long enough to almost any doctrine of radical reform to find it in the end accepted and established in all respectability .

		It was a spirit of eager in - quiry in many directions that made it impos - sible for the young engraver to settle down stolidly to his task , as was expected of him by his father , and to accept unquestioningly and contentedly the lot in life whereunto tha * t father believed him to have been born .

		In the following passage we see some of his striv - ings for larger things : I did not remain long at the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		I hardly know why I think because I suffered then , as at other times in my life , from a most plentiful lack of cash .

		It may have been because I thought I knew a better way : I did not , but I had to find that out .

		So I bobbed about from one thing to another and mastered none .

		I bought my books for myself at the old second-hand bookshops , then extant in Holywell * MY HARVEST .

		asked a neighboring dealer of a colleague , as I was once engaged in this way .

		`` Quiet , '' was the answer ; `` all readers an ' no buyers to-night . ''

		I dropped the volume and vanished into the fog to hide my shame .

		I was like the monkey with the nuts in the fable .

		I could withdraw nothing from the vase of scholar - ship because I wanted to grasp all .

		Far into the night he pushed his reading of such hard-won books as he possessed , some - times kneeling at his literary devotions to keep himself from falling asleep in his chair .

		Like
John Muir	PERSON	at a rather earlier date , he invented and used a device for awakening him to his studies at the dawn of day .

		It worked to admiration , but aroused the whole house - hold as well as the inventor .

		`` Given a certain temperament , and I had it , '' he re - marks at the conclusion of this episode , `` all this portended book-writing or crime per - haps both in a way .

		I made up my mind to be a writer , and to slip the collar of the other art as soon as I could . ''

		Carried by a lucky chance to
Paris	LOCATION	, as above indicated , several years before the downfall of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	found himself , as he says , `` in touch with the little band who were quietly engineering '' that impending collapse .

		With the Reclus brothers , especially , one of whom nearly paid with his life for the part he took in this enter - prise , he was on terms of intimacy .

		A pass - ing pen-portrait of the less famous of the two , with a brief characterization of the pair in their dominant traits , is worth reproducing .

		The elder ,
Elie	PERSON	, was the perfect thing in fanaticism , cold and self-contained .

		He might have sat for the portrait of a Covenanter .

		Spiritually he reminded me of those animals whose jaws lock in what they bite .

		Heredity may have had something to do with it : the father was a Swiss pastor of the Calvinistie type .

		The pair , I imagine , had long since parted with their Christianity to put philosophic Anarchy in its place .

		With old Blanqui , another notable figure of the time , they were for ni Dieu , ni maitre , the abso - lute freedom of the individual to walk by his own light , with nothing but his conscience for guide and law ... I came most in contact with Elie because his English was better .

		The only soft spot in him was his love of literature : he usually carried a volume of Hugo in his pocket , perhaps as the best expression of the current revolt for freedom , in that domain .

		Yet , inconsistently enough , he was disposed , as a Frenchman , to make a reservation here in favour of order and law .

		Our easy-going independence of these things in English letters was hateful to him .

		`` The negroid dialects , '' he once remarked to me in his icy way , `` have the same simplicity of structure . ''

		Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	's winning of a place in jour - nalism came after only a brief agony of desperate effort and semi-destitution .

		It was luck , again , so far as there is any such thing , that brought to him the suggestion of his 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	first `` hit , '' a humorous-satirical sketch en - titled `` A Night in
Belgrave Square	LOCATION	by a Costermonger . ''

		This was a sort of reply or offset to a like performance that had set the town talking , namely , `` A Night in a Work - house by an Amateur Casual . ''

		`` The Pall Mall Gazette '' had published this latter , to its considerable profit ; and `` The Evening Star '' was glad to score an equal success with the companion piece offered by an untried genius , who was afterward not unwilling to go on with his Costermonger `` and make him a character the
Coster	PERSON	here , there and every - where in a survey of the whole scheme of things . ''

		Finally a book was made of him , which has served its ends , had its day , and passed into obscurity .

		Its author says in regard to this fortunate stumbling upon the theme that then best suited him , after con - siderable wasted energy and ink : `` The one thing I had never thought of writing about was the thing that was nearest to my heart .

		The shyness of the pen is sometimes the most invincible of all . ''

		Of journalistic openings to the author of these costermongerings there seems to have been an unfailing abundance ; or that is the impression conveyed by the narrative , though what disappointed hopes and weary waitings there may have been interspersed , and wisely left to forgetfulness , who can say ?


Justin McCarthy	PERSON	, prominent in those days as a ver - satile and accomplished journalist , historian , novelist , and miscellaneous writer , was one of the many literary craftsmen with whom this auspiciously beginning journalist was brought into friendly contact ; and the picture pre - sented of the optimistic and genial and wonderfully resourceful author of `` A His - tory of Our Own Times '' is well drawn and pleasing .

		His literary style is pointed out as the one exception to the rule that easy writing makes hard reading ; but the author weakens the effect by recording later instances of the same exceptionality , as for instance
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, a marvellously ready and rapid writer whom to read is far from being a task .

		Among the leading newspapers that at one time or another enlisted the services of Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	, may be named the
New York	LOCATION	`` World '' and `` Tribune '' and the Manchester `` Guardian . ''

		To
Geneva	LOCATION	to report the
Alabama	LOCATION	arbitration he was sent by the first - named , and to
Madrid	LOCATION	to observe
Spain	LOCATION	in revolution , just after the abdication of Amadeus , he went in the service of the `` Tribune . ''

		Later missions of a similar char - acter took him to
Russia	LOCATION	, to
Germany	LOCATION	, to
France	LOCATION	more than once , and to our !

		own country .

		Among American authors he names
Emerson	PERSON	as `` the most abiding influence on my life , '' and pays tribute to
Irving	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, Whitman ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and
Henry James	PERSON	, finding in many of these and other writers of this new land an agreeable note of kinship with those of the mother country .

		Generous in his praise of great authors , Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	can also be liberal in sarcastic disapproval of some whom he regards as less great .

		An ardent lover of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he necessarily finds himself at odds with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in the latter 's outspoken dispraise of the great poet .

		Ibsen , too , fails to kindle his enthusiasm .

		In a paragraph toward the end of his final chapter , a chapter which he entitles `` Threshing Out , '' the author in a sane and conservative fashion gives his out - look for the future .

		He says : Blessedness , the sweet of adversity for the building up of character , self-control , self-denial , the old beati - tudes , no matter what their theological setting , the old new birth of the spirit into its real self - hood , in one word , all that differentiates the finished article from the mere mistakes of the potter , these , I think , in their struggle for the recovery of the old ethical pattern , are going to be the note of a new time .

		May the prophecy come true !

		There is much else that is sane and of wholesome in - fluence in the book thus brought to a close .

		It will repay careful reading .

		A CENTTJKY AND A HALF or AMERICAN DIPLOMACY .

		* `` Diplomacy is dynamite with a soft voice , '' Professor Fish tells us .

		`` The American type , '' he might have added , `` is often used with amazing carelessness . ''

		That our hap - hazard practice of the art , inspired as often by ignorance as by design , has not resulted more disastrously is another evidence of the special Providence that guards the destinies of the American people .

		At the same time it affords positive proof that public opinion in
America	LOCATION	needs to become `` internationally minded . ''

		This is one purpose that inspires the present volume , and a careful perusal of its pages leads us to believe that the author will measurably achieve it .

		In one sense American diplomacy begins with the famous Papal Bulls of
1493	DATE	, but there are comparatively few other manifestations until the eighteenth century .

		The
Treaty of Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	, in
1713	DATE	, followed a half century later by the Treaty of

1763	DATE	, affords the proper basis for * AMERICAN DIPLOMACY .

1916	DATE	-RSB- 377 later American territorial diplomacy .

		The struggle for political independence involved the task of obtaining continental recognition and of re-arranging commercial relations with the former
Mother Country	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	were inclined to regard the new nation merely as a convenient protectorate , to be tolerated or bullied as best served their financial and commercial needs .

		This attitude persisted long after the forma - tion of a `` more perfect Union , '' and was fed by foreign predilections that long continued to determine domestic partisanship .

		The situation was complicated by the wars arising from the French Revolution and the advent of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	.

		In the ensuing general struggle , the
United States	LOCATION	appeared then , as now , the most conspicuous champion of the rights of neutral commerce , with diplomacy as its most potent weapon .

		At the same time , the desire to navigate the great interior water - ways and round out the national domain encountered an obstinate resistance from
Spain	LOCATION	, reluctant to jeopardize her colonies .

		This reluctance naturally evoked an equally strong determination , favored by the situa - tion abroad , to assist these colonies in gaining their independence .

		Thus commercial needs , territorial ambition , and political idealism combined to influence the four decades of American diplomacy preceding the formal announcement of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the diplomatic problems of that day the Americans brought some experience derived from Indian councils , early colonial agency , and the halls of
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		With this slender training they surprised contem - poraries and gratified posterity by the measure of success that crowned their efforts .

		If , in many instances , good fortune rather than good management brought about this result , they suffered but little in comparison with their opponents .

		Occasionally more astute than the latter , they uniformly surpassed them in directness and persistence .

		Their diplomacy , often amateurish in method and at times dis - porting itself in `` shirt sleeves , '' depended less on `` bluff '' than simplicity and patience to gain its ends .

		No American need be ashamed of our foreign service when
Frank	PERSON	- lin ,
Jay	PERSON	, the Pinckneys ,
Gallatin	LOCATION	, and the '' brace of Adamses '' graced its rolls .

		Following the Napoleonic wars , nearly a score of years were necessary to settle the questions arising from that series of conflicts , to establish relations with our southern neigh - bors , and to announce with them a common separateness from
Europe	LOCATION	.


New Granada	LOCATION	, subsequently
Colombia	LOCATION	, in
South America	LOCATION	, and
Mexico	LOCATION	on our borders , occupied then and thereafter a prominent place in our Latin - American negotiations , and were ultimately to bear the brunt of our `` manifest destiny . ''

		This same catchword was used to strengthen our territorial claim to the
Pacific Northwest	LOCATION	; where , however , we were finally led to acknowledge the co-existent claim of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		In the mid-century , Asiatic exclu - siveness was forced to yield to commercial expansion and in turn to feel the effects of our own racial antipathy .

		The Civil War renewed the problems of blockade and neutral commerce , but with our nation in the role of belligerent .

		This internecine strife likewise provoked in
Mexico	LOCATION	the most serious test of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and inspired the most virulent threats against continued British domination in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		For more than half a century the fisheries , commercial claims , and Isthmian transit served to put an edge on our diplomatic deal - ings with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Tying our own hands with the
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty	ORGANIZATION	, we avoided a clash over the last-named issue , but we did not thereby improve our relations with the
Caribbean	LOCATION	powers .

		Finally a boundary dispute in
Venezuela	LOCATION	gave the opportunity to proclaim that the fiat of the
United States	LOCATION	was law upon the American continent .

		The at - tempt to force from
Great Britain	LOCATION	a recogni - tion of this principle almost precipitated hostilities between the two countries , but it also marked the beginning of a new era in American diplomacy .

		Seward ,
Evarts	PERSON	,
Blaine	PERSON	, and
Olney	PERSON	exhibited a vigorous American spirit that rivalled the earlier manifestation of Clay ,
Calhoun	PERSON	, Web - ster , and
Cass	PERSON	, but fell far short of the standard set by our earliest diplomats .

		Web - ster and
Seward	ORGANIZATION	, the latter aided by a third member of the
Adams	PERSON	family , were alone worthy to rank with the generation that pro- duced
John Jay	PERSON	and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		But
Seward	PERSON	's acquisition of
Alaska	LOCATION	was a far less notable act than the
Florida	LOCATION	Treaty ; and
Webster	PERSON	's vigorous rejoinder to
Hulseman	PERSON	was far more grandiloquent than the dignified expression of American policy that preceded the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		After
Seward	PERSON	and
Evarts	PERSON	, not even
Blaine	PERSON	and
Olney	PERSON	could lift American diplomacy from the slough of petty and personal interests into which it had fallen .

		But events were working for a speedy change in our foreign policy .

		The interven - tion in
Cuba	LOCATION	established the hegemony of the
United States	LOCATION	in the
Caribbean	LOCATION	and made pos - sible the construction of an Isthmian canal wholly under American auspices .

		The occu - pation of the
Philippines	LOCATION	planted the
Ameri	PERSON	- can flag as a challenge on the coast of
Asia	LOCATION	, 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	and marked the way thither by scattered outposts in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The expansion that occurred at the end of the nineteenth century fulfilled some of the prophecies uttered at the beginning , but it did not closely correspond to its earlier counterpart .

		Its purposes were more clearly protective and altruistic , but its methods were distinctly imperialistic .

		The `` open door '' policy of
John Hay	PERSON	, the abroga - tion of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty that he secured , the dismemberment of
Colombia	LOCATION	that he sanctioned , and the protectorate that his successors have virtually established over
Santo Domingo	LOCATION	,
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, and
Hayti	LOCATION	, mark successive steps in this new American im - perialism .

		Benevolent guidance rather than assimila - tion constituted its chief motive , although it could not wholly erase the mark of `` dollar diplomacy , '' and has conspicuously failed to exorcise racial antipathy .

		A new `` Pan Americanism '' has come into being , alongside the earlier exclusive
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Watchful waiting '' has blocked the intangi - ble alliance between foreign concessionaires and our
State Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		The issues of neutrality are with us in greater measure than ever before ; while the promising development of international arbitration , in which our part was so conspicuous , must await the outcome of the present cataclysm .

		Our national influ - ence is greater than ever ; our responsibilities have increased in proportionate degree ; but the majority - , of our population , hyphenated or otherwise , is not fully aware of either fact .

		Professor Fish 's soft-speaking but dynamic volume ought to arouse a fair measure of interest in his subject .

		It is timely .

		Its popular figures , well-turned phrases , apt characterizations , clever summaries , and vigor - ous descriptions , in which even the illuminat - ing utterances of Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	have their part , should be welcome to the general reader .

		He presents a connected and well-proportioned summary of our diplomatic history at a time when diplomacy has an unexpected meaning for the average thoughtful citizen .

		But one does not have to belong to this class , even , to appreciate the vivid sketches of past worthies in that field or to contrast their elevated responsibilities with the strivings for social prestige that but yesterday marked the service .

		The author has not hesitated to express his opinion , whether he decries the War of
1812	DATE	and our war with
Spain	LOCATION	, approves the course of
John Adams	PERSON	in
1799	DATE	, or characterizes
Blaine	PERSON	as `` charlatan and genius , '' whose superficial imitation of Clay made compari - son with the latter odious .

		The few surviving admirers of the `` Plumed Knight '' may not relish these references to their hero , but we might expect them from a student of
Ameri	LOCATION	- can civil service .

		Elsewhere he does full justice to
Elaine	PERSON	's permanent contributions .

		His interpretations and inferences are specific , well placed , and give a clear idea of the con - nection between a particular event and the establishment of a precedent based upon it .

		The various steps in the development of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	are especially well treated .

		As a text book for college classes , the work should prove particularly valuable .

		It has a good complement of maps , although the one relating to the Floridas will bear considerable revision , and one or two others should be subjected to slight changes .

		The sequence of events leading to the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	is not clearly observed .

		There are far too many minor slips in dates and other minutiae , and numerous instances of careless proof-reading .

		These will doubtless be corrected in the later edition which this work should call forth .

		The author 's treatment of the series of diplo - matic problems affecting our whole southern frontier , is , in the present reviewer 's judg - ment , hardly adequate ; but it is far easier to say this than to point out specific improve - ments in the same space , especially in view of the wide field the author attempts to cover .

		The treatment of the Indian , and of western topics in general , is gratifying .

		The book is well proportioned , with a minimum of direct quotation , illustrative rather than definitive in character .

		Some readers may prefer a more strict adherence to the topical method than Professor Fish has followed .

		But a good teacher can remedy this defect , if such it be ; while most will agree that the chronological treatment , with numerous chapters and para - graph indentations , adds to the usefulness of the book as a text .

		One misses a formal bibliography .

		The rather infrequent foot - notes , giving references to monographs , collections of personal and general corre - spondence , and the better known scholarly magazines , suggest material for further study rather than afford citations to support the text .

		The index is ample , and evidently reasonably accurate .

		Professor Fish has not produced a treatise like
Trescott	PERSON	's .

		This is but another way of saying that his work is not based on personal experience , and that it does not embody the traditions of an earlier age .

		Nor does he exhibit the cautious judgment and predilec - tion for system that mark the books of ex-Secretary Foster .

		But his pages reveal a purpose , easily perceptible to student and casual reader .

		American diplomacy , with all its faults , has been characterized by simplicity ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 379 liberality , and directness .

		Personality , too , has played its part , but not in a way to obscure the true features of democracy .

		Our author wishes us to see these facts , and suc - ceeds in making us see them .

		For this , his work deserves hearty commendation .

		WAR RELIGION .

		* The Christian mind has never been so stag - gered as by the Great War .

		This shows the lack of logic in the Christian mind ; for the hidden sins that eat placidly , poisonously , continuously , into the life of society give the lie to Christianity quite as much as war does .

		The death-rate among babies in a congested city is as devilish a fact as the slaughter of men by shrapnel and bayonets ; indeed it is worse in a way , for fewer idealistic pretexts can be found for indirect murder than for modern war .

		The helplessness of the churches to stop that death-rate has long been cause of scoffing to radicals , and Christian men had as much reason to be ashamed of themselves in
1913	DATE	as they have now .

		Yet the visible is the effective .

		For drama - tic horror , this breaking loose of Hell in a seemingly secure and refined civilization is without parallel .

		`` We all know it , witness our restless days and haunted nights .


Chris	PERSON	- tians know it perhaps best of all , and they are unhappy people these days .

		Their unhappi - ness , their perplexity , and , better , their attempts at constructive thinking , are re - flected in numerous books , a few of which are dealt with in this review .

		When first the war broke out , men could utter little beyond a cry of pain .

		As it goes on , the power of thought awakens .

		The race must keep on living , and it must find out how .

		Religious minds ought to have some solution to offer ; and the chief thing that strikes one in glancing over this group of books is that people are beginning to * WAR AND CHRISTIANITY .

		recognize a stimulating power in the world - catastrophe , and to see in it not only judgment but opportunity .


France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	are represented here .

		There are , as it happens , no books from
Germany	LOCATION	or
Italy	LOCATION	; but no one doubts that in these countries also are minds that rise with
Romain Rolland	PERSON	`` above the battle . ''

		Perhaps a writer in the `` Christliche Welt '' expressed other Germans besides him - self awhile ago , when he demanded that a moratorium be proclaimed on Christianity till the war is over .

		The Pope is thinking , though nobody dare pretend to read his mind .

		Not all of these books are directly concerned with the issues of the present war .

		Indeed , the most striking of the group ,
Solovyof	ORGANIZATION	's `` War and Christianity , '' was published in
1900	DATE	, and the author died the following year .

		His thought is occupied with a general inquiry into the relations of Christianity to warfare and incidentally to all earthly life .

		The result is rather an extraordinary book .

		It shows the habitual Russian blend of realism with mys - ticism , of sardonic irony with naive and fervid faith .

		It is inconclusive , but it searches deep .

		The form is that of imaginary conversations .

		They are breezy , full of wit , as clever and modern as they are Russian .

		The speakers include a fine old
General	ORGANIZATION	, erect-minded , religious , who is plunged in distress because modern peace-propaganda is undermining the devout faith in the nobility of war , necessary to the maintenance of military ideals ; a poli - tician , a good disputant , who entertains as he says the usual enlightened European point of view ; a lady who plays the part of hostess ; a young Prince , follower of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, aglow with pacifist , socialist , humanitarian views ; and a mysterious Mr.
Z.	PERSON	, who stays in the background , cracking an occasional joke or briefly exposing a fallacy , till he emerges in the last dialogue as the uncompromising Christian mystic , and bears off the honors .

		It would be difficult to defend war better than the
General	ORGANIZATION	does .

		Able statesmanship , fatuous and worldly , is capitally expressed by the politician .

		Culture and civilization are his shibboleths , and he has an international mind .

		War was a necessity while
Europe	LOCATION	was evolv - ing order from barbarism , but it is becoming obsolete .

		In a society which possesses in com - mon Shakespeare and
Goethe	PERSON	and the great geniuses of
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, any war would henceforth be civil war and is unlikely to happen .

		The pacifists meet his approval , for they are helping to dispel any slight danger that remains .

		The politician is an old man , and he talks at the end of the
last century	DATE	, so one may hope that he died happy .

		380 -LSB-
April 13	DATE	The portrait of the Prince is the most inter - esting .

		He is the aversion of Solovyof , who was the determined opponent of Tolstoyan ideas .

		The choicest modern phrases concern - ing fraternity , social welfare , neo-Christianity that eliminates Christ , the kingdom of God on earth , run glibly off his lips .

		But there is something queer about him .

		The talk in time strikes into religious lines .

		Of a sudden , Mr.
Z.	PERSON	challenges the reality of progress , and the stark question emerges whether Christianity justifies faith in social redemption on earth , or whether it points to a catastrophic end of history .

		Anti- Christ is mentioned j the Prince slips abruptly away .

		But when he returns , the distasteful subject is still under discussion .

		In the pleasant
Riviera	LOCATION	villa where the friends are gathered it is noted that the atmosphere has slightly darkened .

		Mr.
Z.	PERSON	now leads the conversation .

		It is he who raised that ques - tion about progress , he who stresses the antithesis between a religion centred in a Resurrection , and the travesty as he thinks concerned only with kindliness and social welfare .

		The hint why the Prince ran away is not pursued ; only Mr.
Z.	PERSON	closes the talk by reading a manuscript written by a monk , his friend .

		It is the prophecy of a world in which war has ceased and the ideals - of the Prince prevail under the sway of Anti-Christ in person , till the End of History arrives .

		This last section may seem a mere fantasia , like
Hugh Benson	PERSON	's `` Lord of the World , '' which it curiously resembles .

		But somehow , again and again the book strikes to the quick .

		In the pacifist and humanitarian ideal , Solovyof sees only a subtle form of material - ism , to be viewed with contemptuous dread .

		Should this ideal be fully realized , men will continue to live not in a Kingdom of God but in a
Kingdom of Death	ORGANIZATION	, unless they accept the revelation of immortality in the
Risen Christ	LOCATION	.

		The cessation of war , social justice , all tem - poral improvements , are either temptations or trivialities .

		Nothing matters except the power of humanity to maintain faith in the eternal soul .

		In the assumption that belief in earthly progress and in supernatural
Chris	PERSON	- tianity are incompatible , may be recognized a pessimism peculiarly Russian and peculiarly profound .

		It is to be feared that Solovyof would often hear the voice of his Prince in certain of the other books in our group , which approach the subject of peace purely from an ethical direc - tion .

		This is true in the most vital of an interesting group of papers gathered from a Pacifist Conference in
London	LOCATION	, those in par - ticular by the Hon.
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	and Mr.
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	, which scintillate with keen and brave ideas .

		It is probably the Prince who speaks also through Dr.
Adler	PERSON	's `` The World Crisis and Its Meaning , '' but he has gained insight and it is hard to cavil at him .

		The book is cogent and constructive .

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	is not a peace-at-any-price man .

		He holds that war may be just , even in self - defence , that is , `` in defence of the human - ity resident in your own person . ''

		Yet he is clear that its moral assets are either temporary or by-products , and that `` the fierce stimulant of war '' is not necessary to nerve us to escape the evils of commercial sin .

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	is like Solovyof in at least one respect : he sees that militarism is merely a symptom , which can not be attacked directly .

		`` Militarism is the gun , but the power behind the gun is commercial - ism , industrialism , imperialism . ''

		`` The ma - chine gun is the counterpart of the machine loom . ''

		Thus the human race has run into a sort of an impasse both in industry and in war .

		How to get out of it ?

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	shows relentlessly the weakness of most of the safe - guards urged .

		The mainsprings of the peace movement , `` the appeal to sentiment and the appeal to pecuniary self-interest , '' have proved helpless .

		Religion and socialism are broken reeds .

		Little faith can be placed in
Hague	LOCATION	tribunals , international courts , or the abolition of secret diplomacy .

		Nationalism , based on the need for commercial expansion , culminating in rival imperialisms , and using militarism for its tool , is stronger than them all .

		But in the purification of nationalism can be found the slow way out .

		Mere cosmo - politan ideals are useless ; but `` a world-wide ethical movement inspired by an enlightened sense of varied national types is called for . ''

		A contribution to just such a sense is offered in an interesting and partially fresh chapter on American , German , and English ideals .

		German Pflicht und Schuldigkeit plus a mys - tic impulse are set against the aristocratic English watchword `` noblesse oblige , '' with its conception of government from the top down , and the American reverence for the uncom - mon quality latent in the common man .

		When sympathetic understanding and mutual regard among nations are mature , and only then , something may be hoped for from mechanical devices for the enforcement of peace .

		Sacrifice and self-control are as essen - tial as sympathy to compass the great end , but sacrifice for the nation can be found else - where than in war , in the sphere of political and social activity .

		The book is therefore quite properly devoted in the last half to de - veloping an admirable programme of social reform .

		The suggested incentive to such
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 reform is `` so to live as to release the life that is in others . ''

		It is a noble formula , and if applied would certainly end war .

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	claims that not sympathy but spirituality is the animus of it .

		Christians will find it hard to acknowledge this , and are likely to deem the incentive , taken by itself , insufficient .

		The understanding of alien national types for which Dr.
Adler	PERSON	pleads is remote from some of the belligerents .

		Here is an English book , `` The Great Sacrifice , '' which moves on very high levels in a way , urging with power the necessity that
England	LOCATION	repent her of her sins , but at the same time serenely assured that her cause is the cause of the Lord .

		And here are two of the chief religious leaders of
France	LOCATION	,
M. Paul Sabatier	PERSON	and
M. Paul Loisy	PERSON	, equally convinced that sheer barbarism char - acterizes their opponents .

		Solovyof 's
General	ORGANIZATION	would enjoy their assumption that fight to the death is the only way of righteousness .

		Each adds to this comfortable faith a personal stress , for war does not suppress one 's private specialties in enthusiasm .

		M. Saba - tier is concerned with the genial effort to illustrate the promise of spiritual rebirth in
France	LOCATION	;
M. Loisy	PERSON	quite as characteristically appears largely desirous of discrediting the Pope , and denying the increase of Catholic sympathies in his country .

		But the author of `` L'Evangile et 1 ` Eglise '' goes further .

		He presses home by all the resources of his elo - quence , and he has , as the translator says , a style `` light , clear , and pregnant , '' `` the impotence of the Gospel to realize its ideal . ''

		`` We are compelled to acknowledge that
Christendom	LOCATION	has failed continuously and in - creasingly to carry out the principles laid down by Christ .

		And the reason is not to be sought in our human imperfection , but rather in the too simple imaginative and rigid form which the principle itself has assumed in the Gospel .

		It was a sublime and unrealiz - able dream . ''

		Perhaps the war marks the final stage in discarding the dream .

		One feels that the former priest contemplates with a certain bitter satisfaction the spectacle of Christian nations destroying each other .

		And since old habit is strong , and the need for some sort of religion indubitable , it is with profound joy that he hails in Dr.
Adler	PERSON	's `` purified sense of nationality '' the successor and substitute to the ascetic mythology which has long held Western thought under its dreamy yoke .

		His sharply cut contention is that patriotism and Christianity are opposed , and that patriotism is destined to supplant Christianity as a religious power . ''

		Christianity is not founded upon the notion of humanity , but upon the transcendental and un verifiable notion of a plan of eternal salvation devised by the Master of the universe for those whom he has willed to choose . ''

		`` The gospel of Jesus implies the non-existence of nationality ; it effaces it . ''

		`` The author of this little book makes no claim except to patriotism , such a national and truly humane ideal as may be a return towards the religions of antiquity .

		His final conclusion is that this ideal can and should go far beyond Christianity itself . ''

		This `` super-religion , '' consisting in respect , first , for the individual , then for the nation , `` has been derived from the Gospel ; it has been prepared by the Gospel , and would not have been born without it , but it is going beyond it . ''

		Nothing conduces to clear think - ing more than saying exactly what one means ;
M. Loisy	PERSON	is unmistakable .

		So the Frenchman , like the Russian , faces a complete discrepancy between social or national progress and the ideal of Jesus ; only where the Russian draws the inference that progress is worthless , the Frenchman decides that the Gospel is obsolete .

		The remaining books in our list deny the alternative .

		They are all the products of Christian optimism , maintaining , a little breathlessly , that if Christianity can only for once get itself tried it will outgrow war and usher in the
King	LOCATION	- dom .

		They are equally sure that unless it does get itself tried , the race is headed for suicide .

		None of these books have the literary charm of the French or the Russian .

		Most are ex - tended pamphlets , written by professed paci - fists , succinct , pertinent , and charged to the lay mind with Christian commonsense .

		Neither their diagnosis nor their remedies , to be sure , come within the present horizon of politics , but so much the worse for politics .

		The encouraging thing about them is that , see - ing the long perspective ahead , they do not lose heart , but seek stubbornly to raise the peace-movement `` from the mazy region of propaganda up to the plane of international politics '' and to enlist statesmanship rather than sentiment in its service .

		They are free from partisanship ; and they achieve - an auda - cious feat of imagination , for they contem - plate a Christian nation !

		In that nation , honor is identified with forbearance and not with self-assertion , and risks are taken for the sake of peace .

		Far from coveting military efficiency , it would avoid that , because , as Dr.
Jefferson	PERSON	says , the first effect of it would be to make the nations afraid of us , and `` it is the worst fate that can befall a nation that other nations become afraid of it .

		Fear passes in - evitably into hate , and the hate of its neigh - 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	bors is the one thing that no nation can afford ... Who knows what might happen if a great Republic like ours should take a mag - nificent risk for God ? ''

		This attitude does not mean belief that force can be wholly dismissed : against reason - able preparedness -LRB- soothing and meaningless watchword ! -RRB-

		these authors have no protest .

		But generous fancy plays around far possi - bilities .

		Instead of spending thirty millions on two dreadnoughts , Dr.
Jefferson	PERSON	sees
America	LOCATION	pouring out the same sum for the healing of the nations .

		And if indemnities are to be exacted , why should the nations responsible for the slaughter pay them ?

		Why not we , who have suffered less and can afford more than any other people ?

		Indemnities , be it remembered , are not paid by guilty governments but by innocent working folk .

		In like spirit , Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	outlines a truly heavenly policy toward
Mexico	LOCATION	, such as might surely end her antagonism to us and almost put an end to her troubles .

		Such interna - tional behaviour might incidentally prove highly conducive to safety and prosperity in the long run !

		These books are not written by dreamers , however , but by minds at close grapple with reality .

		On a nearer level , they are full of clear , keen thinking .

		Dr.
Atkins	PERSON	analyzes with convincing power the real causes of war .

		Dr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's study of the situation from a religious point of view leads straight to named corruptions at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		As for Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	, his definite and brilliant proposals for the solution of our immigrant problem in the West have attracted attention in highest quar - ters .

		It may be said of all these works that they are rich in constructive suggestions , worthy the attention of all sober persons .

		It is mean thought that does not kindle at such ideas ; but it is foolish thought that ex - pects to realize them easily .

		Sensible and inevitable as they sound , humanity must be born again to achieve them .

		No Hague con - ference , no pacifist machinery will avail , on this all lay equal stress , unless behind them lies a virile Christianity , strong to inspire national policies with the courage of fraternal faith .

		Must not such Christianity draw from deeper sources than mere ethical ideals ?

		The supernatural in religion is not discussed by these books ; it is assumed .

		They do not stop to ask whether the Gospel be simply an ad interim policy , for use while the human race awaits annihilation ; they feel too desperately that all other sources of redemption fail .

		In the words of the Master of Life , they read no `` plan of eternal salvation '' for the elect , but principles of divine wisdom one with love , which in measure as they are introduced into the hearts of men must pass into the structure of states .

		An English book entitled `` Christ and Peace , '' a collection of papers by minds now active in the
Fellowship of Reconciliation	ORGANIZATION	, presses close home the Christian ideal in its fulness .

		It looks for the winning of the world to peace only when it shall be won to
Christ	LOCATION	, and the
Cross	ORGANIZATION	dominates the road which leads to the great goal .

		On lines of statesmanship , this book is less valuable than some others ; but of all under review it offers most help to the troubled private conscience .

		Perhaps it places a shade too much emphasis on the crime of inflicting physical death , as if that could be segregated from other crimes and put in a separate and more evil class .

		But the book as a whole has a pathetic interest as the work of Englishmen who have actually learned to love their enemies -LRB- one remembers that early in the war a clergyman was publicly rebuked for preaching from this text -RRB- , and who are suffering for their convictions .

		`` Church and
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by another English - man , the Rev.
William Temple	PERSON	, may give yet more aid than the last to troubled minds .

		Mr.
Temple	PERSON	, one of the authors of that stirring book , `` Foundations , '' is a leader among the younger High Churchmen .

		His temperate , illuminating , closely reasoned discussion of the relations of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	has no direct bearing on the peace problem ; and it can not be given in this review the attention which it deserves .

		But it meets point by point the argument of
M. Loisy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Religion is broader than Christianity , and
Christianity	ORGANIZATION	is broader than the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet even for the poor hesi - tant Church -LRB- to be revered , says one of the other writers , `` not for what it has done but for what it is going to do '' -RRB- the present crisis may offer the opportunity of the ages .

		Only , however , thinks Mr.
Temple	PERSON	, if that crisis stimulates it to embrace at once that principle of nationality which Catholicism has wrongly ignored , and that universal ideal which the Reformation abandoned .

		If it can rise to this height we may yet see , not a free Church in a free State but free States in a free Church , and such a Church may be the very power needed to purify patriotism from its narrow - ness , and the essential preliminary to a united and fraternal world .

		At all events , the religious mind , as met in these books , is neither moribund nor cloistered .

		It is bowed down by penitence , it gropes be - wildered among shadows , it contradicts itself often .

		But it lives and wakes and seeks .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 383 RECENT FICTIOX .

		* Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's ``
John Bogardus	PERSON	'' is the story of a young man with a pre-arranged education who came into the monotonous con - ventionality of American university life and felt that if he was ever to be anything worth while he must make his escape , get out into the world , and become something worth while to be .

		So only would he have anything to teach .

		He went out into the world and served several turns , first as a gentleman-vagabond and then as a sailor , and learned that what - ever one becomes , one always becomes all that one has been , or , in other words , that every - thing counts and that one must count every - thing , especially in marriage .

		This wisdom he gained by several experiences .

		The first taught him something about the personal life , the second something about the life in com - mon , both through the medium of girls .

		He then drifted into being a man of letters , and had another and deeper experience of which I can not state the exact influence , save that -LRB- in connection with the war -RRB- it gave him en - larged and excellent views on society which he embodied in some very impressive essays on `` The New Crucifixion . ''

		The result of ` these essays was that he was once more called to the university from which he had made his escape , and accepted the call with the feeling that he had at last got something that he could teach .

		It is not said whether there will be another volume telling what he taught , and -LRB- to my mind a much more difficult matter -RRB- how he taught it .

		From this account one will easily judge that one ought to read this book with more sympa - thetic interest than I have had .

		I must confess that this is so , although Mr.
Chamber	PERSON	- lain 's main idea -LRB- so far as I grasp it -RRB- seems to me excellent .

		Many must feel how unsatis - factory is the teaching and living founded only on what one has been told , whether by a previous generation or by one 's own , or what one has read in books or magazines or
Sunday	DATE	supplements .

		One often wants -LRB- whether a university teacher or not -RRB- to live a life and to see others live a life which is the simple and direct expression of what one really is .

		Mill - ions have had that feeling , and it is at the very bottom of that revolutionary teaching which will in time transform the world .

		Nothing external is enough , our Lord felt , *

		no laws , commandments , customs , usages , principles , or anything else .

		It is only from within that one can have real life .


John Bogardus	PERSON	set off on no foolish quest ; he set off on a journey in which he had been pre - ceded by some of the noblest who have lived .

		That he did not seek the end by the way they trod is not necessarily against him or against Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, for one must work with what one has , and in the end if you get to the right place you are there , however you may have got there .

		Nor is it remarkable that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	should have found that the way he had conceived led to a new -LRB- and to most of our minds a very discreditable -RRB- cruci - fixion , for some sort of crucifixion inevitably stands before the end of such a way .

		One need not object to such reasons as those .

		But in reading a story like this , one can not avoid wanting to be carried along by a sense of reality , by a feeling of life , by the illusion -LRB- if illusion it be -RRB- that all this is so , that how - ever strange these ways , however unjustified in the minds of the wise and the prudent , however impossible to those who judge of what may be by the cold proof of what has always been , yet still that outcome is plain , undeniable , and absolutely right and to be desired .

		In fact , one may offer the book its own test .

		All this , we may say , must come out of actual - ity .

		Not because Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has read of such and such experiences of farm-hand and sailor , or thought of them , or wished for them , not even because he may have had them .

		It is of no consequence what he read , thought of , wished , or was , unless his reading , think - ing , wishing , being has somehow given him the power of understanding the tremendous cross-currents of the life he tells of , or of feel - ing their tumultuous courses so deeply that he can make it all seem to us in a measure at least what it has been to him , or may have been .

		The book should give us the illusion , at least , of life .

		There are two other books which come to mind here : Mr.
Kussy	PERSON	's `` The Abyss , '' and Mr.
Noble	PERSON	's `` The Bottle-Fillers , '' for they deal more particularly with phases of life that ``
John Bogardus	PERSON	'' passes over rather lightly , one the life of a vagabond , the other the life of a sailor .

		These books appear to be written by men whose heads and hearts are full of things that they must write down .

		They are full of actuality , full of detail , full of fact .

		They do not carry conviction to an equal degree ; `` The Bottle-Fillers '' is the more vivid , the more living , the more actual book .

		Both writers are possessed by an idea , and that idea much the same : the insistent feeling that 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	the sailor , the hobo , is an individual who struggles in a failing fight with the dead weight of a social indifference and a social stupidity .

		Yet in neither book is the idea so dominant as to override the things which give it form ; in neither does it take away from the impression of life itself .

		The captain of the inferior and overloaded `` tramp '' first battles with the sea , then has to battle -LRB- in an inquiry -RRB- with the inadequate machinery of an out-worn system , then with the vaguely pon - derable weight of society in general , always pressing on a man already down .

		It is all good ; in all , Mr.
Noble	PERSON	knows what he is talking of and takes his time to tell us .

		Storm at sea , dense and heavy lawcourt , the dirty round of the wet docks , one after another , and a dozen more , scene after scene , give us the actual , vital , acrid taste of life , yet thrilling too , even tonic .

		The descriptions of the sea are the best , perhaps because even in life itself some things are felt more keenly than others ; the touch of art is always the same whether the subject be remarkable or common - place , yet there is something in subject too .

		Mr.
Noble	PERSON	is a fine hand at the sea .

		I have read nothing by him before ; if I had , I should be sure to remember it .

		Nor is the book merely a string of descriptions , nothing of the sort : there are people in it too , not such very marked characters but people with feel - ing , deep and passionate , so that we follow along the course of
O'Hagan	PERSON	and Lucy with that sort of sympathy that makes one acquiesce in the end that our writer sees must be .

		Good fortune , or bad fortune , it all has the sign of actuality .

		`` The Abyss '' does not give any such sense of coming direct from life itself , nor could one properly expect that it would .

		Few who have ever known those depths as a matter of daily experience ever come up to what we think of as the surface .

		Hobos , broken men , down-and-outs rarely turn men of letters .

		If one would write of such life one must learn of it from such report as one may get , and it is hard work to give a clear , an undisturbed view .

		Mr.
Kussy	PERSON	's book sounds a little too much like the newspapers in some places , too much like
Dickens	PERSON	in others .

		It rarely has the peculiar smell of the underworld ; his people have had a bath and their clothes have been fumigated .

		Still , there is much in the book .

		The childhood of the little Jewish boy , the life on the road , the days in prison , the effort to make a place in the world of
New York	LOCATION	, are all true to life , even if they have not the absolute illusion to make it seem life itself .

		Both books make us feel what the authors have in mind .

		They do not have to tell us often , it is true , they can not help telling us how hard is the world , how cruel , how stupid , but that is because it seems as though they could not help it , as though the thing were somehow pressed out of them .

		Such books make more of an impression on me than the rather airy resume that gives us the striking points in the working out of an idea .

		`` Those about Trench '' is a very interesting book , though it seems to be written with a thorough disregard for the very things which might have been chiefly counted on to make it so .

		One can not say it has a well-constructed plot ; it begins with an interest about Dr. Trench , goes on with
Saadi Sereef	PERSON	, and then gets well settled for the last half on
Jaffer	PERSON	, whom no one has heard of before .

		Then it is not strong on character : the representatives of the different nationalities who have gath - ered about Trench seem admirably drawn , but the only one I can judge the American is sadly commonplace or else conventional , and so , possibly , the others may be .

		The book has a `` fundamental idea '' without much doubt , but for most of one 's reading one forgets that there is one , and the author certainly neglects to clinch the matter at the end .

		Indeed , Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	neglects to do most of the things he ought to have done -LRB- in any ordinary well - behaved way -RRB- , and yet he somehow gives the constant impression that he is all right and that his book is excellent .

		One reads it with unflagging interest in what is going to happen next ; the people are always entertaining -LRB- except perhaps one or two -RRB- , and the idea of the book keeps impressing itself here and there so that at the end one remembers it , even though Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	does not bother to say much on the subject .

		Those about Trench from whom the book is named are a number of medical students gathered in
Chicago	LOCATION	from various parts of the earth
China	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	for the study of medicine , who have come under the wing of Dr. Trench and live in a sort of caravansary in his house .

		Just this combination is probably enough to carry any book , indeed , if Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	had not allowed himself to be diverted from them to topics unprovided for in his title he would probably have developed the possibility more fully .

		Beside these five , there is
Jaffer	PERSON	-LRB- who used to be of the number but has gone back to the hill-country of
India	LOCATION	-RRB- and
Saadi Sereef	PERSON	, who really take away the interest from the caravansary and locate it in their own persons and proceedings .

		Not the least charm of these Orientals is their mastery of the English language .

		The Persian appears to be the best at it ; he is certainly much more elegant than
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 385 the Bostonian , whose conversation is deplora - bly like that of other Americans of his age .

		But
Saadi Sereef	PERSON	comes very near him , though his inability -LRB- apparently total -RRB- to imagine the function of the article in our speech gives his language a most whimsical turn .

		But it is not merely with these interesting Orientals that the story has to do .

		Dr. Trench has other interests , and Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has chosen as the time for his story the period of a year or so -LRB- I take it -RRB- before his marriage , so that we become interested in the lady who became his wife and her concerns .

		All these matters are intermingled and developed and make a plot which , as I have said , is not at all what it should be .

		Dr. Trench was a scientist and what we should vaguely call an atheist , at least he told
Saadi	PERSON	he did not believe in Bog .

		Ameen was a very broad-minded person , Chatter jee belonged to the
Brahmo Somaj	PERSON	,
Becker	PERSON	was a Jew , Wu may have been a Confucian ,
Deland	LOCATION	was an earnest member of the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	,
Saadi	PERSON	said he hated and despised religion .

		There was in all this something oppressive to Miss
Edith Bridgeman	PERSON	, a young woman with strong religious convictions and principles who was engaged in studying science .

		She and Dr. Trench both gained an enlargement of view during the time covered by the story .

		So did Saadi , although I am not at all clear just what it was .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	probably felt that he had better business in hand than theological or even psychological analysis .

		He possibly felt that viewing life as he did and seeing certain things in it , it was quite enough to present what he saw and let the rest take care of itself .

		I think he was quite right .

		No one can maintain that a novelist should have no con - victions about the serious things of life -LRB- religion among them -RRB- , or that he should not allow them a place in his books .

		It is better that he should believe much and that what he believes should be found in his books .

		It has been so with almost all great novelists : they have had all sorts of beliefs and convic - tions , and one has generally been able to get at those they felt most important .

		Our preju - dice against such things comes first in the case of men who are not great novelists , but who take the form of the novel as a means of presenting their views .

		It is deepened by those who , though they have something of the novelist 's art , are still unable to make their ideas implicit in the picture of life that they convey .

		Mr.
H. G. `` Wells	PERSON	, a while ago , took pains to say that religion nowadays was prac - tically barred from the newspaper and the novel .

		As to the newspaper , we need not concern ourselves ; but as to the novel , it may be said that -LRB- whatever be the fact -RRB- there is always an opportunity for religion in a novel when there happens to be a religious element in the life that has interested the novelist .

		Hence there is a good deal of religious thought in the novels of our own time , about one hundred times the amount there was when Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	said , `` Thank heaven , the religious novel is a thing of the past . '' ''

		Those about Trench '' is not a religious novel , but the people who are in it are not insensible to what is still one of the most universal of the higher impulses of life .

		BRTEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		A posthumous volume by Sister Several books by the late Sister Nivedita -LRB-
Margaret E. Noble	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- columns , all of them being concerned primar - ily with presenting
Hinduism	LOCATION	to
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	minds .

		In a new volume by this remarkable Irish woman , `` Religion and Dharma '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , we have the other side of her work .

		Here again she is absolutely confident of the `` power of the Indian consciousness to absorb the contribution of the West and to transmute it '' ; and she is equally confident that
Hinduism	LOCATION	in some form will soon be the leading religion and philosophy of the world .

		`` Not the churches of the world alone , but the very universities of
Europe	LOCATION	, will yet do homage before the names of Indian thinkers , who , living in the shelter of forest-trees , and clad in birch-bark or in loin-cloths , have for - mulated truths more penetrating and more comprehensive than any of which
Europe	LOCATION	her - self childishly bent on material comfort ever dreamed . ''

		But she is not so intent on emphasizing this belief as on appealing to
Young India	LOCATION	to appropriate and develop the virtues we are prone to think of as belonging rather to the Occident than to the Orient .

		Of course it is impossible to say what effect these papers will have on their readers ; but to the present reviewer they seem exactly the sort of thing that ought to be said to the youth of
India	LOCATION	.

		`` Righteousness lies in duty done . ''

		`` Heroism in great moments is the natural blossom of a life that in its little moments is fine and fearless . ''

		``
Hinduism	LOCATION	will undoubt - edly develop a larger democratic element . ''

		`` The struggle with material conditions is eternally necessary for the upward growth of the spirit . ''

		`` Does it matter that instead of ringing the temple bells at evening , we are to turn to revive a dying industry ?

		Does it matter that instead of altars we are to build 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	factories and universities ? ''

		`` Fighting is worship as good as praying .

		Labor is offer - ing as acceptable as Ganges water . ''

		But readers who are interested in
India	LOCATION	will prefer to make their own excerpts from this thought - ful volume .

		Probably we should note that the pieces in this posthumous collection appeared originally
several years ago	DATE	.

		In a brief Introduction , Mr.
H. K. Ratcliffe	PERSON	says we should remember that they `` were thrown off with great rapidity in the midst of a crowded and arduous life of service in
India	LOCATION	'' ; but no apology is needed , when their purpose is kept in mind .

		When , in the late autumn of \ book , of
1914	DATE	, the first bewildered fugi - the homeless .

		.

		tives from the war areas began to drift into
Paris	LOCATION	, and some systematic provi - sion for their relief became imperative , Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	and others of a little group of American and French residents in the capital organized the American Hostels for Refugees .

		To provide needed funds for the ever-increasing activities of this organization , and for the allied labors of the
Children of Flanders Rescue Committee	ORGANIZATION	, Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	conceived the plan of enlisting the collabora - tion of her literary and artistic confreres in the production of a volume that might be likely to find a wide popular sale in this coun - try and abroad .

		This plan is now realized in `` The Book of the Homeless '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a quarto of imposing beauty in every external detail , and providing in its contents a remark - ably varied and attractive feast .

		So many famous names English , American , French , Belgian appear in the list of contributors that to begin to specify without going through the entire roll would be difficult indeed .

		Besides editing the volume , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has enriched its pages with an original poem and with numerous English renderings , remark - able in quality , of the poems contributed by French writers .

		These , and the offerings of
Henry James	PERSON	, Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, seem to us the most notable items on the literary side .

		In the artistic section , special mention should be made of the fine photogravure from
Sargent	LOCATION	's portrait of
Henry James	PERSON	, and the reproductions in color of work by
Leon Bakst	PERSON	,
Claude Monet	PERSON	, and
Rodin	PERSON	.

		There are one or two contributions that might well have been spared from the book , as for instance ,
Miss Agnes Repplier	ORGANIZATION	's attempt to maintain the novel thesis that the sins of one nation cancel or obliterate the sins of another , the writer misquoting
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	into the bargain ; or Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's solemn arraignment of `` The Arrogance and Servility of
Germany	LOCATION	'' on the evidence of a nocturnal frolic of some German officers in a Konigswinter hotel .

		A delicious bit of fooling , in grateful contrast to the necessarily rather sombre atmosphere of the book as a whole , is Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	's colored cartoon , `` A Gracious Act , '' depicting `` Lord
Curzon	PERSON	of Kedleston reading to M. Cammaerts a translation -LRB- signed with his own hand -RRB- of a poem by M. Cammaerts . ''

		Alto - gether , we can not commend this notable book too unreservedly to our readers , both for its own quality and for the sake of the beneficent charities in whose interests it is published .

		Humorous If Mr -
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	is aspects of the always as successful in enter - ot ' taining his lecture-audiences as he is in amusing his readers with anec - dotes of his lecturing experiences , he will never speak to other than full houses .

		`` From Pillar to Post '' -LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- rehearses the humors , agreeable and vexa - tious , of a lecturer 's lot as recalled by Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	after an extended acquaintance with its pleasures and pains .

		His open - ing chapter contains a reminiscence , not untimely at the present moment , of a finely characteristic exhibition of tact and kindness on the part of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	.

		At an authors ' reading toward the end of the last century he was attacked , before the performance began , by stage fright , if we are to believe his words , and was only rescued from utter collapse by the touch of a woman 's soft hand on his own and the sound of a woman 's voice , with a slight catch and tremor in it , saying : `` Oh , Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	, do you know I am so nervous about going out before all those people to-night that I really believe I shall have to borrow some of your manly courage and strength to carry me through ! ''

		The speaker was Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, `` her lovely eyes full of sympathy , touched with a joyous reas - suring twinkle . ''

		Enjoyably human and real are the many varied characters , chance ac - quaintances for the most part , that give life and color to Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	's pages , though the oddity of the `` vagrant poet '' in chapter five tends to strain credulity .

		It is a book packed with amusing incident and accident -LRB- the latter not always so amusing to the victim -RRB- as well as with manifold types of human nature .

		Mr.
John R. Neill	PERSON	catches the spirit of it all in his numerous drawings .

		Professor
Charles Sanford Terry	PERSON	's `` Short History of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- is the last of a series of three volumes in which the author attempts to cover the history of
Europe	LOCATION	since European history , 1806-1914 .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 387 the `` fall of
Rome	LOCATION	'' in 476 .

		The present volume begins with the dissolution of the
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	and closes with the outbreak of the great European War or , as he calls it , the Zweikaiserkrieg of
1914	DATE	.

		Professor
Terry	PERSON	's treatment of his theme differs from that of conventional histories in that he deals almost exclusively with large movements of international importance and ignores everything that is isolated and unre - lated to the larger politics .

		The work conse - quently includes no discussion of domestic problems and legislation in the various states ; and even Socialism , which has at least been believed to be an international movement , is discussed only in connection with the republi - can experiment of
France	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		On the other hand , the reconstruction of
Switzerland	LOCATION	is treated at considerable length , and a chap - ter is given to
Latin America	LOCATION	and its revolt from
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The author writes clearly and energetically , and has succeeded well in his effort to give a concise account of the great changes which
Europe	LOCATION	has undergone during the past hundred years .

		For the present , however , the interest of the work will lie chiefly in the last fifteen pages , in which Professor
Terry	PERSON	traces the diplomatic moves that led up to the outbreak of the great war .

		As the author holds a professorship in the
University of Aberdeen	ORGANIZATION	, the work is naturally written from the British viewpoint .

		But except for a few pages of the Introduction and the closing chapter , Professor
Terry	PERSON	's history will be found profitable and enjoyable read - ing by all , even by those whose sympathies at present are with the central powers .

		The methods From the corners of the artistic and aims of universe , Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	'' * has collected in `` Methods and Aims in the Study of Literature '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- an admirable series of extracts designed primar - ily for advanced college classes .

		The first section of the book , `` On Method in General , '' draws light from
Leonardo da Vinci	LOCATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	.


Kenyon Cox	ORGANIZATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, and others as diverse , in an endeavor to discover the bond between science and art .

		All of this is highly stimulat - ing to careful thought , though the underlying unity of method in science and art is perhaps not so fruitful a conception as the funda - mental distinctions between the two .

		The subsequent divisions deal with the practice of great writers in composing -LRB- with emphasis on revision -RRB- , the reading of great poets , and , as a concluding illustration of the principles previously stressed , `` Method in the Poetry of Love . ''

		Although Professor
Cooper	PERSON	's book is concerned with method rather than with matter , and would therefore need to be sup - plemented , for practical use , with a book or with lectures on literature as an interpretation of life , it does excellently what imperatively needs to be done , it makes perfectly clear the rigorous discipline without which the writer is foredoomed to oblivion .

		This is made impressive physiologically , so to speak , through the extracts from
Dorothy Words	PERSON	- worth 's `` Journals , '' in which
William	PERSON	is recorded as constantly tiring himself with labor on `` The Pedlar , '' and sleeping very ill , and even keeping the dinner waiting till four o'clock .

		The editor has happily included his own `` Glance at
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Reading , '' re - printed from `` Modern Language Notes . ''

		of ^ r '
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	has said of
Walt Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's influence , `` I find it difficult to imagine what my life would have been without it , '' and he has also , on the same page of his own chief work , emphasized the fact of his own distinc - tive qualities of mind and heart and disposi - tion , thus : `` Anyhow , our temperaments , standpoints , antecedents , etc. , are so entirely diverse and opposite that , except for a few points , I can hardly imagine that there is much real resemblance to be traced . ''

		Exactly what is the nature of the younger man 's in - debtedness to the older is expressed by Mr.
Edward Lewis	PERSON	in his book , `` Edward Carpen - ter : An Exposition and an Appreciation '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in `` the figure of speech that Whitman played the part of a midwife in the deliverance of
Carpenter	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual child . ''

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's chapters naturally concern them - selves to a great extent with `` Toward Democ - racy , '' its writer 's most elaborate expression of his creed , and in form and substance an inevitable reminder of `` Leaves of Grass . ''

		But if its writer harked back to Whitman in this work , he anticipated another master , Professor
Bergson	PERSON	, in some thoughts to which he gave utterance in a later important book , `` The Art of Creation . ''

		These two works , with others of narrower scope , from the same pen , are made to illuminate the dozen chapters that set forth the doctrine of this remarkable teacher , while the opening and closing pages are given to more purely personal aspects of the man .

		The book is provided with portrait , index , and footnotes .

		It is a warmly sympa - thetic treatment of its theme .

		The recent widespread interest in the great writers of modern
Russia	LOCATION	may have operated indi - rectly in bringing about now , for the first time , the translation into English of the early An epic of mediaeval
Russia	LOCATION	, 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	historical epic , ' ' The Tale of the Armament of Igor '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Cer - tainly it seems strange to those familiar with the degree of ignorance of and indifference toward English literature of the Middle Ages a degree of ignorance and indifference much greater than that shown to Old English to find this twelfth century epic of
Russia	LOCATION	trans - lated with the hope of gaining readers .

		A further surprise which will greet the student of European literature who has not been able to read the Slavonic , is the sophistication and genuine poetic merit of this poem , written between
1185	DATE	and
1187	DATE	eighteen years prior to our own `` Brut '' of Layamon .

		It is de - cidedly not inferior to the `` Brut '' in spirit or in style .

		The unknown author seems to have been a companion of
Igor Svyatoslavish	PERSON	in an unsuccessful foray against the Polovtsy .

		The story , following the chronicle closely , has no wide national significance , except as show - ing in the character of
Igor	PERSON	, in his impulsive generosity but his fatal weakness , the desper - ate state of central
Russia	LOCATION	under the wide - spread anarchy obtaining at the time .

		The manuscript , dating from the sixteenth cen - tury , was discovered in
1795	DATE	, and published in
1800	DATE	by Count Musin-Pushkin .

		The pur - pose of the editor and translator , Mr.
Leonard A. Magnus	PERSON	-LRB- who , by the way , is about to pub - lish a `` Concise Grammar of the Russian Lan - guage '' -RRB- , is of course linguistic rather than literary .

		The notes and critical material are satisfying and illuminating .

		The value of the book is further enhanced by a map of mediseval Russian , complete genealogical tables of the period , and especially by a scheme of transliteration from the Greek or Cyrillic alphabet to the Romanized forms .

		The world needs continually to Socrates as a .

		guide in the be introduced to its great men .

William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	's , in his little volume entitled `` Socrates , Master of Life '' -LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to `` re - interpret , imaginatively yet critically , an ancient personality that has too often become for the scholar merely one or another technical problem , and for the general reader too often but a name or an anecdote . ''

		Provided with a select bibliography , and giving a balanced account of the life and philosophy of
Socrates	LOCATION	, the book is frankly introductory ; but , as the title indicates , the greatness of
Socrates	ORGANIZATION	is made to consist in his wisdom in the conduct of life .

		`` Kant founded the moral life in the good will ; Socrates in right thinking . ''

		And the author admirably points out the timeli - ness of his subject , in that `` the romantic ethical tendencies of to-day need the propae - deutic of
Socrates	LOCATION	more than of
Kant	PERSON	.

		The good will we have always with us , giving often enough , with ghastly best wishes , unwittingly a serpent for a fish and a stone for bread ; but the intelligence to see the practical bearings of conduct and to discriminate between higher and lower ideals is too often lacking to the dwarfing of the individual and to the confu - sion of society .

		The fool in
Sill	ORGANIZATION	's poem -LRB- which goes deep -RRB- prayed not for the good will , but for wisdom ; and therefore the less fool he . ''

		In `` Confessions of Two Broth - ers , '' by Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	and Mr.
Llewellyn Powys	PERSON	, there is the same resolutely uncom - promising , grimly unflattering disclosure of self as in the recently noticed book of a third brother , namely , `` The Soliloquy of a Her - mit , '' by Mr.
Theodore Francis Powys	PERSON	.

		All three have the courage of unreserved candor ` SO far as candor can be unreserved .

		All three , but especially
John and Theodore	PERSON	, take a sort of sardonic delight in heaping scorn upon their own weaknesses and deriding their own follies .

		Of course there must be some - thing of literary affectation in all this , even while the writers profess to give nothing but the naked truth .

		When , for instance , the first - named of the three declares himself utterly devoid of `` sympathetic interest in himself , '' and then devotes chapter after chapter to self-dissection and self-portrayal , he fails to convince the reader in that one respect .

		To the mind not interested in its own processes it never once occurs to proclaim the fact , so engrossing is the outer world .

		But the younger of the `` two brothers , '' Mr.
Llewellyn Powys	PERSON	, is clearly more concerned with the objective than with the subjective .

		His con - tribution to the volume is something more than spiritual autobiography , admirable though that is in the preceding portion , and his extracts from `` the diary of a private tutor '' and from `` a consumptive 's diary , '' with a too brief mention of a visit to
America	LOCATION	-LRB- from his native
England	LOCATION	-RRB- , are agreeably free from the introspection that , in its turn , had made the other 's pages equally interest - ing , in a different way .

		Whatever the faults of the book , it is not commonplace or insig - nificant .

		The earliest documents , ex -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 tending down to the close of the
XVII Dynasty	ORGANIZATION	, have just appeared as Volume I .

		Such well known inscriptions as the auto - biography of Uni and the literary tale of Sinuhe are included .

		Though the established character of these and the other records is evident from the comprehensive bibliography cited , the author has gone over them again with the latest researches in mind , noting in detail even the exact signs used in the Egyp - tian texts .

		In fact , the greater share of his space is occupied by introductory description and columns of collation and transliteration , much of which workshop material could well have been left to its sources .

		The translations modestly disclaim '' anything in the nature of originality or authority . ''

		Mr.
Paton	PERSON	's depen - dence results in minor slips which would scarcely be possible to an Egyptologist .

		The Asiatic names which form the goal of the present work are extended into a final col - umn .

		But the context has loomed so large in the author 's thought and treatment that even this column of results shows more African terms than
Asiatic	LOCATION	.

		The book is printed from unduly reduced zinc etchings of typewritten tables , very neat in appearance but a burden to the eyes .

		Form and material , then , com - bine to discourage the reader .

		The compila - tion is chiefly of bibliographical value .

Jewish Theological Seminary of America	ORGANIZATION	, presents a concise , eloquent , and depressing statement of the history of the Jewish people in the Slavonic countries .

		The style of the book is fluent , and is marked with an undercurrent of repressed emotion which can not but color the data presented .

		No attempt is made either to analyze documents or to expound situations .

		The book moves as a compendious narrative , from which all that might interfere with the progress of the story has been eliminated .

		The adventure of the Jews into
Poland	LOCATION	, the history of their relation to the Polish kings , to the Shlakhta or nobility , their economic rivalry with the burghers , their rise and de - cline in power , their gradual isolation from contact with the non-Jewish world , their reac - tion to the policy of heartless annihilation initiated by the Russian government after the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	, are all touched on with a firm hand and profound sympathy .

		The Russian government , indeed , is credited in the preface with `` a consistent attempt to destroy Jews and Judaism in that country . ''

		The case makes itself .

		On the other hand , the chapter on the inner development of
Russo	PERSON	- Polish Jewry is inadequate .

		The existence of a chartered autonomy , and the consequent federal form of inter-communal organization are declared , but not sufficiently exhibited , nor their effects described .

		Similarly , the record of spiritual changes marking the rise of new religious modes , of the Hebrew and
Yiddish Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, of the neo-nationalist movement and other secularist developments , serves only to whet the appetite for more .

		It is to be hoped that Professor
Friedlander	PERSON	will some day give us an adequate book on these topics .

		A volume by Mr.
Geoffrey Rhodes	PERSON	on `` Mind Cures '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- tempts the reviewer to resort to the sort of damning by faint praise which is his dangerous privilege .

		The book deserves a better fate , though it is doubtful whether it adds very considerably to a knowl - edge of the subject or to the convenient aids to acquiring such a knowledge .

		It presents a variety of moderate virtues .

		It reflects a modern and a reasonable point of view ; it is safe and sane .

		Its citations of psychology are sound , and its applications timely .

		Indeed , the accounts of cases , many of them growing out of the practice of the author , constitute the most valuable portion of the manual .

		It is not very systematically or convincingly put together ; it leaves the reader with the im - pression that mind cures are real , but scarcely develops that impression to an orderly under - standing of the basis of mental action in the alleviation of physical ills .

		As a discursive introduction to the subject it may be safely commended .

		The
Bible Well	ORGANIZATION	fitted to arouse interest in as a work the Bible as a work of literature is the little book by Mr.
George P. Eckman	PERSON	entitled , `` The Literary Primacy of the Bible . ''

		Its six chapters were originally delivered as the second series of
Mendenhall Lectures	ORGANIZATION	at
De Pauw University	ORGANIZATION	, and are introduced with a foreword by President
Grose	PERSON	.

		That the lecturer has not in this in - stance concerned himself exclusively with doctrinal theology in his message to his De Pauw audience , may be inferred from the headings of his lectures , such as `` The Poetry and Oratory of the Bible , '' `` The Fiction and Humor of the Bible , '' and `` The Bible the Most Persistent Force in Literature . ''

		In asserting of the
Bible	ORGANIZATION	, as he does at the outset , that `` the larger number of our colleges and universities insist on placing it among the indispensable text-books of their curricula , '' the author rather seems to make the wish the 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	father to the assertion .

		In how many college catalogues is the Bible included in the list of prescribed text-books ?

		Both literary and Biblical learning and illustrative anecdote , with a wealth of apt quotation , are found in this readable volume from one whose own literary style bears evidence of profitable hours spent with the book which
Charles Dudley Warner	ORGANIZATION	once went so far as to call `` in itself almost a liberal education . ''

		-LRB- The Methodist Book Concern . -RRB-

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A revised edition of `` The History of American Music '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Mr.
Louis C. Elson	PERSON	forms the second volume in the series , `` The History of American Art , '' prepared under the editorial super - vision of Mr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		The merits of Mr.
Elson	PERSON	's work were pointed out in these columns some twelve years ago upon its first appearance , when it was warmly commended as a valuable guide in its field .

		Dr.
Charles Brodie Patterson	PERSON	, in `` The Rhythm of Life '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , rightly emphasizes the im - portance of music in the educational scheme ; the Greeks long ago taught the world the indispensa - bility of music to culture .

		But rhythmic effects are produced not by sound alone ; color also has its harmonies .

		`` Color is sound made visible , and sound is color made audible . ''

		The regenerating , re-invigorating , therapeutic action of visible and audible harmonies on the human system is en - larged upon with enthusiasm by Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	.

		The score of chapters treat of music as a com - pelling power , the dance , music and color tones , color tonics , music and character , cosmic conscious - ness , musical therapeutics , and other related themes , all presented with the persuasive charm that comes from earnestness and conviction on the writer 's part .

		In his
Conway Memorial Lecture	ORGANIZATION	on the `` The Stoic Philosophy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	gives a fresh and enlivening account of `` a way of looking at the world and the practical problems of life which possesses still a permanent interest for the human race and a permanent power of inspiration . ''

		The review , in the course of an hour , of a system so multifoldly inspired , with a content so various , and with an appeal to men of temperament and station so opposed as
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	and
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	, can hardly do more than sketch in its outline .

		Professor
Murray	PERSON	does this with a characteristically firm hand .

		He shows how Stoicism is a theory of life , a religion , rather than a system of dialectic , and how consequently logic - ally contradictory but practically and emotionally satisfactory conclusions are drawn from its prem - ises at the same time .

		The
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	has recently pub - lished part one of `` A Bibliography of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' compiled by Mr.
Earl G. Swem	PERSON	, who has already to his credit several excellent publications of smaller character .

		This bibliography contains 7,000 titles of books now in the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	which relate to
Virginia	LOCATION	or were written by Vir - ginians or were printed in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Official pub - lications are not included , but it is planned to bring out a list of these as part two of the bibliog - raphy .

		Mr.
Swem	PERSON	estimated that the collections in the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	lack 10,000 to 15,000 titles of being complete ; and he announces that as the missing titles are acquired supplementary lists will be issued .

		This publication is a first-class contribution to American bibliography .

		It is fit - ting that the `` Mother of Presidents '' should be among the foremost of the states in preserving the history of her people .

		One hopes that the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	, on account of the excellent character of its work , will receive the financial and other support which it deserves .

		Under the somewhat pretentious title , `` The Uni - versal Plot Catalog , '' a little manual by Mr.
Henry Albert Phillips	PERSON	brings together in classified form a good number of items suitable for use as plot material , and introduces this material with instruc - tive remarks on the best way to handle it in plot - construction .

		Not to seven or eleven or any other definite number does he reduce all the variations of the major plots that have in countless shapes enter - tained the lovers of romance from the earliest times ; on the contrary , he asserts that `` it would take many large tomes '' to hold merely a list of all the plots that have ever been used , while the number of `` good , complete plots that are possible through combinations of plot material '' he believes to be incalculable .

		A careful index with cross references is appended to the table of plot material , and an illustrative example of the skilful use of such material is given .

		If the story-teller , unlike the poet , is made and not born , here is the book that will help to the making of him .

		-LRB-
Stanhope-Dodge Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Larchmont	LOCATION	, N. Y. -RRB- Since the publication , three hundred and fifty years ago , of
Aurifaber	ORGANIZATION	's compilation of Luther 's table-talk , many additional records have come to light , and much of this new material has been put into printed form in comparatively recent years .

		Luther had many reporters , and their notes are all of interest .

		Thus , besides
Aurifaber	PERSON	, there were Lauterbaeh , Cordatus ,
Schlaginhaufen	LOCATION	,
Mathesius	PERSON	,
Rabe	ORGANIZATION	,
Heydenreich	LOCATION	,
Weller	PERSON	,
Besold	LOCATION	, and
Plato	PERSON	-LRB- name of good omen in this connection -RRB- , who all , as students at the
Black Cloister	ORGANIZATION	, sat at the master 's board at one time or another , and zealously recorded his utterances .

		A selection from this more lately published material has been made and translated , with notes and index , by that well-equipped Luther scholar ,
Preserved Smith	ORGANIZATION	, Ph.D. , with the collaboration of
Herbert Percival Gallinger	PERSON	, Ph.D. `` Conversations with Luther '' is the book 's title , and within modest compass will be found the cream of the great reformer 's famil - iar talk not already long familiar to the world in the standard work mentioned above .

		Portraits and other illustrations are judiciously supplied .

		The
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	will pub - lish the book .

		`` Victory in Defeat '' is the title of a war book by Mr.
Stanley Washburn	PERSON	to be published imme - diately by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	.

		It deals entirely with the Russian phase of the war , giving an analytical account of the great Russian retreat from
Galicia	LOCATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	.

		A new volume from the pen of Mr.
Fielding Hall	PERSON	, to be entitled `` For
England	LOCATION	, '' will appear shortly .

		Like Mr.
Fielding Hall	PERSON	's last book , `` The Field of Honour , '' this new volume will consist of stories and poems not of actual warfare itself , but rather of the indirect effects of war upon the homes of
England	LOCATION	.

		A volume of `` Selected Poems '' by
Gustaf Froding	PERSON	, translated from the Swedish and pro- vided with an Introduction by Mr.
Charles Whar	PERSON	- ton
Stork	ORGANIZATION	, will be issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the first English translation of Froding , who , in the opinion of Professor
Stork	ORGANIZATION	, is `` the most striking and probably the greatest figure in the long array of distinguished Swedish poets . ''

		Among other forthcoming publications of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	are the following : `` The Ivory Child , '' by Sir Rider Haggard ; `` My Lady of the Moor , '' by Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	; `` Driftwood Spars , '' by Mr.

		The volume will contain illustrated essays on the work of
William Glackens	PERSON	,
Ernest Lawson	PERSON	,
John Sloan	PERSON	,
Walter Gay	PERSON	, and

		This year 's
summer	DATE	meetings of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	will occur in successive weeks and in the same neighborhood .

		The thirty-eighth annual conference of the library association will be held from
June 26 to July 1	DATE	, at
Asbury Park	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, followed in the next week by the fifty-fourth meet - ing of the teachers , in
New York	LOCATION	, Library and educational workers will thus have another oppor - tunity for discussion of common problems .

		Miss
Mary W. Plummer	PERSON	, of the
Library School of New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is president of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, and Mr.
George B. Utley	PERSON	,
A. L. A. Executive Office	ORGANIZATION	, 78
East Washington	LOCATION	Street ,

		Chronologically arranged , a 76-page catalogue of `` Books and Pamphlets Published in
Canada	LOCATION	'' from
1767	DATE	to
1837	DATE	, copies of which are in the
Toronto Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is issued by that institution under the editorial supervision of Miss
Frances Staton	PERSON	, head of the
Reference Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a valu - able contribution to Canadian bibliography , and will be followed by others from the same source , as a prefatory note announces .

		If one were to pass any general criticism on this carefully - prepared list , it would relate to its obviously inex - haustive nature , from the fact that it confines itself to works owned by the
Toronto	LOCATION	library .

		A nearer approach to completeness may be attained in sub - sequent editions .

		Valuable work in its field is being accomplished by `` The Photo-Miniature , '' a journal devoted to general photographic information , edited by Mr.
John A. Tennant	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. Tennant & Ward of New York City	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unlike most periodicals , each issue is a complete monograph in itself , written by a specialist who covers his subject in from ten to fifteen thousand words .

		For the current year the
January	DATE	and
February	DATE	issues are at hand , dealing respectively with `` Failures and Why : In Negative Making '' and `` Success with the Pocket Camera . ''

		Conciseness of treatment , convenience in size , numerous illus - trations , and a price that is only nominal , are attractive features of these little monographs , which should be widely popular among photog - raphers , amateur or professional .

		`` The Poetry Review of
America	LOCATION	, '' a monthly periodical devoted to the interests of American poetry in all its phases , will begin publication early in
May	DATE	, under the editorship of Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	and Mr.
Joseph Lebowich	PERSON	.

		The spirit of the publication , according to its prospectus , `` will be one of advancement and 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 13	DATE	cooperation ; the desire to serve the art of poetry and to consolidate public interest in its growth and popularity to quicken and enlarge the poetic pulse of the country .

		In this spirit , we propose to our contemporaries in the field a union of effort and mutual encouragement ; to the poets of
America	LOCATION	an open forum and a clearing-house for ways and means to serve the art we all love ; to the poetry-reading public of our country we pledge a never-ceasing striving for the best in American poetry , and a constant effort to bring out the strength and joy to be derived therefrom . ''

		The biennial
Justin Winsor	PERSON	prize offered by the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	for the best unpublished monograph in American history will be awarded this year .

		The monograph must be based upon independent and original investigation in American history , by which is meant the history of any of the British colonies in
America	LOCATION	to
1783	DATE	, of other territories , continental or insular , which have since been acquired by the
United States	LOCATION	, of the
United States	LOCATION	, and of independent
Latin America	LOCATION	.

		It may deal with any aspect of that history social , political , constitutional , religious , economic , ethnological , military , or biographical , though in the last three instances a treatment exclusively ethnological , military , or biographical would be unfavorably received .

		The monograph must be submitted on or before
July 1	DATE	.

		Full details as to the competition may be obtained from the chairman of the
Justin Winsor	PERSON	Prize Com - mittee , Professor
Carl Russell	PERSON	Fish of the Uni - versity of

		When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL * A THE FOOD-TONIC APPROVED BY SCIENCE , The Value of Sanatogen to the Man who Works His Brain `` Without albumen , no life ; without phosphorus , no thought '' so runs a famous saying .

		True , the healthy body gets enough albumen and phos - phorus from the daily food , but an overtaxed brain and nervous system will run short of these vital substances because the demand outruns the normal supply .

		Then we have fatigue , depression and worse , if nothing be done .

		It is then that
Sanatogen	PERSON	is of splendid aid .

		Combining purest al - bumen and organic phosphorus in chemical union , Sanatogen takes to the fundamental sources of nervous and mental efficiency just the ele - ments needed .

		It supplies these elements quickly and without strain , upon digestion , giving the depleted cells real nutriment , real susten - ance and no false stimulation .

		The result of this is well epitomized by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	when he writes , `` Sanatogen to my mind is a true food-tonic , giving fresh vigor to the overworked body and mind . ''

		And by
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, who tersely reports , `` The effect of Sanatogen upon the nervous system is simply wonderful . ''

		It is good to remember that the medical profession has set the seal of approval upon the value of Sanatogen no less than 21 , 000 doctors have written letters endorsing its value .

		Should not the knowledge of these facts create the conviction that Sanatogen tuill also help you f Grand Prize ,

		The Tragic Muse hides behind her Gorgon head , but
Miss Comedy	ORGANIZATION	has a hundred masks .

		`` Laughter holding both its sides , '' the mor - dant sneer , travesty , wit that is like a web of lightnings , earth-upsetting humor , certainly there is `` God 's plenty '' in the varieties of the risible .

		Slang -LRB- cant , jargon , argot -RRB- is the attempt which the multitude makes to achieve style , its effort to say things differently .

		Three - fourths , probably , of slang has a humorous tinge , for in its nature it is a mockery of the dignified in thought or speech .

		Unquestion - ably it is often excellent fooling .

		The bright wits of the otherwise inarticulate masses strike out unexpected analogies of thought , remarkable felicities of image and phrase .

		And literature has profitted by them accord - ingly .

		There is much slang in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	; a great part of Rabelais is written in argot .

		Without slang what would we do for humor in
America	LOCATION	!

		The trouble with the literary use of slang is twofold .

		In the first place , it is a language within the language .

		It has to be translated when new , and it quickly fades .

		The writer who uses much of it soon requires an apparatus of footnotes .

		In the second place , while the unknown originator of an apt slang word or phrase is a genius , the tenth or ten-thousandth transmitter of it is merely a plagiarist He works with about the cheap - est material that a writer can employ .

		The first time one sees in print such synonyms for man as `` piker , '' `` gink , '' `` long drink of water , '' or verbal re-incarnations of girl into `` chicken , '' `` broiler , '' `` flapper , '' `` squab , '' `` doll , '' `` skirt , '' or `` queen , '' they may seem excruciatingly funny ; but after one has read ten thousand tales or sketches whose humor depends mainly on these expressions , the business becomes a trifle tiresome .

		Yet slang is a vitalizing influence .

		It is an earth ele - ment which both language and literature need for growth .

		The reformed school of spelling seems to have put the professional purveyors of that commodity out of the market .

		Its literate ventures in illiteracy tickle us more than the 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	old masters in the art can do .

		Our Ameri - can adepts who had such a great audience in their day are no longer read .

		Petroleum
V. Nasby	PERSON	,
Philander K. Doesticks	PERSON	, even the great
Artemus Ward	PERSON	, are unknown to the rising generation .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	edited
Artemus Ward	PERSON	's work some years ago ; yet even he , in spite of his love for the native and the new , was forced to confess a certain lack of interest in it .

		Dialect , which has always had a hold on literature -LRB- there are three varieties of dialect in `` The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	'' -RRB- still lives .

		A few years ago it swept over literature like fire over a prairie .

		Nothing could succeed which did not have the local color of dialect or patois .

		In a great measure , writers seem to be coming back to plain English .

		Of course dialect sometimes has as much tradition and authority as academic language .

		Again , it seems to spring up like a gourd in the
night	TIME	.

		The transformation of vowels by which the lower-class English turn `` lady '' into `` lidy '' and `` game '' into `` gime '' seems very recent in origin .

		It would be a curious subject for inquiry as to whether the cockney use or non-use of the letter h goes a long way back .

		I can not recall that the older English comic writers made any fun of this oddity of pronunciation .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	's farce , `` Mr.
H.	PERSON	, '' which is founded on the fact of a man being named `` Hogsflesh , '' would have lost its point if the aspirate had not been generally sounded .

		In proverbs we have the multitude in a sentence-mongering mood .

		These are often grim and grave and wise enough ; but the stoical humor of endurance , the disillusion - ment of experience , come out most in them .

		Unless an author makes his own proverbs , the use of them lays him open to a charge of unoriginality , though when
Sancho Panza	PERSON	comes along with the wisdom of all the Span - ish ages dropping from his tongue , the effect is funny enough .

		Parables and fables are proverbs put into narrative .

		They , too , are the experience of the race eked out by the artist 's skill , and they are overwhelmingly humorous or satir - ical .

		Eenan claimed that one of Christ 's most shining qualities was his wit ; and certainly the parables of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	are full of satire and irony .

		Puns seem to have had their day .

		They do not flourish in contemporary literature , or even in our common parlance .

		Compared with the larger forms of humor , they are about what the fire-fly 's flash is to daylight or lightning .

		But in the hands of masters like
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and
Thomas Hood	PERSON	, they are irresistible .

		The present writer , alas , has been almost as incapable of making a pun as solving a riddle .

		But I remember one .

		A scientific friend was explaining the mysteries of animal magnetism .

		`` What , '' he asked , `` happens when you touch a man ? ''

		`` Why , '' I said , `` sometimes you get turned down . ''

		Perhaps that was too obvious .

		I recall one of my father 's , which strikes me as pathetically good .

		He was in his last illness , and was wasted to a skeleton .

		A friend , a big , bounc - ing chap , had called on us , and was striding up and down the room boasting that he weighed 185 pounds .

		`` Well , '' piped my father , `` you may have the advantage of me in avoirdupois , but I can beat you all hollow in apothecary 's weight . ''

		In the larger , organized forms of humorous literature , fun comes first .

		It is animal spirits put into words or action .

		It is the clash of oddities , the farcical situations which life really affords or which by a good deal of license can be read into life .

		We are so con - stituted that we find something ridiculous in a man slipping on the ice , or a shabby coat , or a pair of soleless shoes .

		The slap-stick of the pantomimist or the brick of the cartoonist answers our primal need for laughter .

		As the Roman slaves had their Saturnalia , so we slaves of work or custom must have our car - nival moments , when we dance or riot for relief .

		There is plenty of this exuberance in literature .

		Perhaps it shows more abun - dantly in the novels of Lever than anywhere else .

		There is hardly anything in these novels but high spirits , practical jokes , orgies of misrule , except duels , which are thrown in by way of balance .

		Travesty , or burlesque , is a higher form of humor .

		It works by pulling down .

		It tum - bles dignity into the dirt .

		It brings Jove upon the stage with an old umbrella and goloshes , and makes Venus scold Mars over the wash-tub .

		Mingled with divine poetry and illimitable imagination , as in
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes , it yields one of the highest types of comedy .

		Parody is a variant of this form .

		Some works , ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' and ``
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	'' for example , began as parodies but developed into great original creations .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 407 What for lack of a better term we must call extravaganza or fantasia is a great element in American humor .

		It asserts absurdities as truths .

		It puts forth impossibilities with the sober certitude of common sense .

		The tales of
Frank Stockton	PERSON	are signal examples of this kind of work .

		But its classic is certainly `` Alice in `` Wonderland . ''

		That tale is the con - centrated essence of everything that could not happen related with historic gravity .

		Wit is a difficult thing to define .

		In the
eighteenth century	DATE	the word was used to cover all forms of mental activity .

		Poets , novelists , essayists , men about town , were all denomi - nated wits .


Richard Bentley	PERSON	was a wit , and I am not sure that Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	was not classified with the great wits of the age .

		We use the word in a more restricted sense now ; yet we hardly know what that sense is .

		We seem to mean by it a brilliant , concentrated , revelational flash of the mind expressed in language .

		Some pieces of literature , like
Congreve	PERSON	's `` Way of the World '' and
Sheri	PERSON	- dan 's `` School for Scandal , '' are all compact of wit .

		Some miscellaneous writers , like
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, and
Lowell	PERSON	, are more wits than anything else .

		But wit is the kindling , originating , inventing , surprise element of the mind , and it permeates pretty nearly everything that the mind does , so that the eighteenth century people were not altogether wrong in their estimate of it .

		It is hard , also , to pick out from the litera - ture of laughter the special quality which we call humor .

		As compared with wit , it is broader and more continuous .

		It is less ex - clusively mental , more the product of the whole man .

		It has relations with the tragic and pathetic which wit has not .

		If its pro- fundities sometimes wound or appal , its pities heal and refresh .

		It probably comes nearer giving the actual truth about human character in its relations to the world and Fate than any other form of literature what - ever .

		It relentlessly exposes the vices , follies , hypocrisies , and littlenesses of mankind , until we ought to be disgusted with life itself .

		But we are not ; for humor puts such vitality into the very rags and leavings of mankind that they are really more to us than angels .

		We take
Burns	PERSON	's drink-sodden beggars to our bosoms ; we applaud Mr.
Pecksniff	PERSON	leaning over the banisters at
Todger	ORGANIZATION	's and adjuring his hearers `` to be moral '' ; we go into ecstacies when
Sairey Gamp	PERSON	and Betsey Prig quarrel over the mythical Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	.

		Although humor has a preference for publicans and sinners , it can deal equally well with the good and noble , as witness
Don Quixote	PERSON	, My Uncle Toby , and
Scott	PERSON	's `` Antiquary . ''

		Dickens is the most prolific of humorists , and one hesitates in placing him with the greatest merely because he lacks somewhat of the !

		profundity of thought which we find in Aris - tophanes ,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and Mo - liere .

		His earthquakes only make the edifices I of man totter and slide about ludicrously ; theirs shake the mightiest structures down , and open abysses in the earth which seem to pierce to the dark foundations of our state .

		Satire is the scourge , the cat-o ' - nine-tails , of literature .

		It proceeds by way of indigna - tion .

		It holds the office of public executioner .

		Yet the best satire gives us enough of con - trast to make its pictures of humanity credi - ble .


Dryden	PERSON	, in his characters of Buckingham and Shaftesbury , allows his victims a dozen lofty or amiable qualities .

		Pope 's
Addison	PERSON	is the picture of a good man spoiled by jealousy .

		The satires of
Horace	PERSON	are tolerably \ good natured .

		When a satirist pursues either a living person or a literary creation with unrelenting fury we feel sure he is not telling the whole truth .

		Buskin 's harsh comment on
Thackeray	PERSON	was that `` the blow-fly had got at the meat and spoiled our dinner . ''

		Formal satire seems to have gone out of fashion , but the satirical vein is apparent in most of the comedies and half of the novels of the world .

		Irony might be defined as the appearance of things propitious , the reality of things malign .

		This is at least a description of the irony which has been attributed to the Greek tragedians , and which is certainly apparent in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sky is blue , and a thun - derbolt falls from it .

		The grass is green and pleasant , and the earth yawns at our feet .

		Verbal irony is best exemplified in the dia - logue of
Socrates	LOCATION	, or those simple statements which indict of Thucydides or Tacitus .

		Socrates probably had to drink hemlock , not because of irreverence to the gods , but because he tangled up the wits of the sophists and tripped up the intellectual heels of the Athe - nian elders by his seemingly innocent questions .

		The greatest , perhaps the only great , English master of verbal irony ,
Junius	PERSON	, had to hide under the mask of that name , and is yet undiscovered , though I believe he was no less a personage than
Chatham	LOCATION	.

		408 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	Playfulness is the last form of humor on our list , and it is the most delightful .

		It may not assay high in wit or humor or wisdom .

		It .

		does not excite laughter , perhaps not even smiles .

		But it kindles a glow within us .

		It is simply charm incarnate , and charm can beat even beauty or grandeur from the field .

		It bears the stamp of high breeding ; and , whether `` gallant and gay in
Clivedon	LOCATION	's proud alcove '' or rustic in
Arden	LOCATION	's forest , it attracts , wins , conquers .

		Orlando comes into the banished Duke 's presence , sword in hand .

		`` I thought that all things had been savage here , '' he says .

		He is received with courtesy and consideration ; the playful talk goes on , and he is soothed and comforted .

		With all their splendor of poetry and dazzle of wit and depth of humor , playfulness is really the predominant note in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's comedies .

		Goldsmith is another author in whom this quality is perpetually present .

		He was play - ful at
The Club	ORGANIZATION	, though sadly misunderstood by
Ursus Major	ORGANIZATION	and his satellites .

		He was playful in his poems , his plays , his novel , and his essays .

		`` The Haunch of Venison '' and `` Retaliation '' are the most perfect playful poems in English literature .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was somewhat elephantine in his gambols , but his letters are playful and so is much of his talk .

		Playfulness puts on no airs ; it simply wants to utter the throbbings of its heart .

		The great letter writers , therefore ,
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	at the head , with Gray ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lowell	PERSON	following , : are adepts in this natural art .

		Most of them did greater things than to write letters , but in their correspondence they forgot their great - ness and only wanted to be happy .

		There is a good deal of playfulness in
Jane Austen	PERSON	, but more acidity .

		She lets us see that she knows her characters are fools '' .

		Shakespeare and
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	probably knew '' , too , but they did not care .

		They liked them better that way .

		Irving is the most playful writer we have had in
America	LOCATION	.

		Taken as a whole , humorous literature is the wrong side of the tapestry .

		It shows the foundation work , the ends and shreds and seams and blurs of what on the other side is a picture of life , painted in smooth and vivid colors by poetry , tragedy , and romance .

		Which is the truest , the grotesque sketch , or the beautiful , harmonious , awe-inspiring vision ?

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		When this reaches you we shall be in the thick of the
Shakespeare Tercentenary Cele	ORGANIZATION	- brations .

		I do n't know whether the word `` thick '' is justified .

		It might perhaps be more applicable in
Germany	LOCATION	, where `` Unser Shaxpur '' -LRB- whose shade is invoked against his degenerate countrymen -RRB- is to be honored with numerous orations and special perform - ances .

		Here the plans are very modest .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's Company will perform as usual , and special Shakespearean exhibitions are to be held at
Stratford	LOCATION	and
Oxford	LOCATION	, where the Bodleian 's unique collection of Shakespeare folios and quartos is to be on show .

		The
London Guildhall	LOCATION	is also exhibiting its folios and its specimen of that anguished arabesque which goes by the name of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sig - nature .

		As the
Bard	ORGANIZATION	's death-day and reputed birth-day is also St.
George	PERSON	's Day we may expect a large crop of newspaper articles on Shakespeare as a patriot .

		And it is too much to hope that the concocters of these articles will avoid the usual error of asserting that
Henry	PERSON	V was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ideal English - man , his pattern king and his chevalier sans reproche .

		Most aspects of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may be argued about ad nauseam , the most interminable discussion always leaving the disputants `` of the same opinion still . ''

		Shakespeare has been compared to a dark por - trait hung under glass : everybody who exam - ines it sees not the portrait but his own face reflected .

		But if there is one thing that ought to be clear to any unprejudiced reader it surely is that in writing `` Henry V '' Shakes - peare was inter alia exposing the stupidity of aggressive Imperialism and the detrimen - tal effects which the militarist creed may have even upon a character in many respects noble and generous .

		Read
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's speech when he threatens to deliver up Harfleur to his fero - cious army if it does not surrender , and ask whether this is the conduct Shakespeare rec - ommends to his country 's sovereigns .

		Tercentenary books are few .

		A large com - pilation by various hands entitled `` Shakes - peare 's
England	LOCATION	'' is announced ; and Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	, one of the most painstaking of living Shakespearean students , has published a num - ber of chips from her workshop under the name of `` Shakespeare 's Industry , '' which a critic has unkindly remarked should rather have been called `` Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	's Industry . ''

		Had we not been engaged in war there would presumably have been an appeal for some hundreds of thousands of pounds to complete the
Shakespeare National Memorial Theatre	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 409 That is too large an order for times like these ; though a week 's receipts from the nation 's cinemas would suffice to run up the most sumptuous theatrical structure in the world .

		A modester scheme has been launched by a number of eminent persons who suggest that ten thousand pounds should be raised to pro- vide a permanent endowment fund for Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	's
Shakespeare Head Press	ORGANIZATION	at
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's is not the only Press at
Stratford	LOCATION	; it was at
Stratford	LOCATION	that Mr.
William Jaggard	PERSON	issued his great `` Shakes - peare Bibliography . ''

		But he is a man who has spent his life in the service of literary scholarship ; and since he established his
Stratford Press	ORGANIZATION	he has published not only a magnificent edition of the Works but also sev - eral volumes of research which will be of immense value to students , but which can scarcely have been commercial speculations of the first water .

		All Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's produc - tions are beautifully printed and bound ; and it would be a great thing if his undertaking were established on a permanent basis .

		What form of commemoration Shakespeare himself would have preferred one can not dare to guess .

		We can not even be certain that the matter would much interest him .

		It is true that he said that his powerful rhyme would not be outlasted by marble or the gilded mon - uments of princes ; but it is also true that , as far as we can discover , he took not the slight - est pains to perpetuate his plays in an accu - rate , or indeed in any , form .

		But it may be presumed , as a general rule , that the most civil thing we can do to any author is to read him .

		To how great an extent we actually do read Shakespeare it is not easy to estimate .

		Was it not in THE DIAL that I saw the other day a complaint that , though works dealing with
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	can be found in every library ,
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's own compositions are in most places unknown ?

		Shakespeare is not in that situa - tion : there is scarcely a middle-class home in
Great Britain	LOCATION	where his Works , bound in limp red morocco , do not lie about on a little table in the drawing room .

		But all the same , the amount of `` mention '' of him in print and speech is , one suspects , out of all proportion to the amount of reading of him that is done .

		He is undoubtedly read much more frequently than any other English author of date earlier than 1800 with the exception of Dr.
John Overall	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward Lively	PERSON	, Dr.
Hadrian	PERSON	a
Saravia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Jeremiah Badcliffe	PERSON	, Mr.
Michael Babbett	PERSON	and others whose names may or may not be recognized as those of the compilers of the authorized version of the Bible .

		But what does the position of `` National Poet '' really come to ?

		Does one Englishman out of a hundred read a single play by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	once a year ?

		It is safe to say that ninety - five out of a hundred never open his works after they have left school .

		Millions of school - children have two or three plays drilled into them , and remember fragments of `` To be , or not to be , '' `` The quality of mercy , '' `` So work the honey bees , '' `` 0 that we now had here , '' and `` Friends , Bomans , countrymen . ''

		These quotations on a man 's lips are almost invari - ably relics of juvenile experience .

		Droves of school-girls are taken every year to see the touring companies in `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' and `` As You Like It '' ; and now and then
London	LOCATION	turns out to see
Miss Somebody	ORGANIZATION	's Juliet , Mr.
Somebody	PERSON	's Hamlet or Sir Some - body Something 's Shylock .

		But we most of us think we are far more familiar with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays than we actually are .

		I mentioned Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's excellent print - ing .

		Quite apart from Shakespeare a press like his is worth encouraging for the sake of its typography .

		English book production is not yet anything like as good as it should be .

		It is not for instance anywhere near the Ger - man level .

		No one who visited the
Leipzig Book-Trades	ORGANIZATION	exhibition in the -LRB- earlier part of the ! -RRB-

		summer of
1914	DATE	could fail to be struck by the immense superiority of the German exhibits in point of appearance .

		But there has been a great improvement here in the last five and twenty years ; and that is unde - niably due to the example set by the various private presses , such as the
Kelmscott	LOCATION	, the Vale , and the Doves .

		These private presses are not usually long-lived .

		They usually pro- duce a few beautiful books and then cease work ; their products then rising to great values in the market .

		Happily there always seems to be somebody to carry on the torch .

		At present Mr.
Arthur Sabin	PERSON	is doing very pretty work at his
Temple Sheen Press	ORGANIZATION	; an - other new one is the
Bomney Street Press	ORGANIZATION	con - ducted by
Francis Meynell	PERSON	, a son of
Alice Meynell	PERSON	the poet .

		Mr.
Meynell	PERSON	has just issued his first volume , a selection of his mother 's recent poems .

		It is a very sound and charm - ing piece of printing .

		The type is the old Fell type which was used in the seventeenth century -LRB- I believe by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and the old typographical ornaments are employed .

		The book is hand rubricated by Mr.
Edward Johnson	PERSON	, one of the finest of modern calligraphers .

		The proprietors of `` Form '' the new art quarterly which I mentioned recently are also bringing out books ; they propose to devote themselves mainly to verse , written out by hand , repro - duced , and illustrated .

		Several other private presses are in the air .

		In some instances 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	people seem to be taking to this form of recre - ation as a means of escape from the nervous strain of war .

		They are taking to chess in the same way ; the shops which sell chessmen find it difficult to cope with the demand for them .

		Notable new books are few .

		The best thing recently has been Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's book `` On the Art of Writing '' which con - tains lectures delivered at
Cambridge	LOCATION	just before the war .

		It is not easy to say anything new about the qualities at which a writer should aim and the defects which he should endeavor to avoid .

		Accuracy and clarity have been eulogized before , and the super - fluous adjective has often been denounced .

		But if Sir
Arthur	PERSON	, not being
Adam	PERSON	or Eve , can not lay down new rules , he has certainly formulated the essentials of good writing as clearly and accurately as any man before him ; and his humor and variety of illustration make his book very delightful to read .

		It is a book that every professional writer should study ; though it makes one painfully self - conscious of the stains and blotches on every sentence that one writes .

		It is above all a book for the person of university age who has not yet developed bad habits which are incur - able .

		It will assist him to think for himself , encourage him to write , and materially help him to avoid writing badly .

		Miss
Louise Sill	PERSON	's translation of
M. Paul Claudel	PERSON	's `` L'Annonce faite a Marie '' comes , I think , from your side .

		If
Claudel	PERSON	were easier reading one could prophesy a boom here .

		Five years ago he was little known ; since then he has stolen silently into an acknowl - edged place amongst the first living French writers .

		People here are beginning to read him ; and though there may be some difference of opinion as to his size I have not yet met anyone who disputes his genius .

		One perform - ance of one play is all we have hitherto seen in
London	LOCATION	of his dramatic work .

		It will be strange if `` L'Annonce '' is allowed to remain much longer unstaged .

		It is a play of great beauty and dramatic force , and it peculiarly lends itself also to the modern `` producer . ''


M. Claudel	PERSON	's war-poems which have reached us are more impressive than anything of the kind that has been done here .

		None worth reading have appeared lately .

		Among other new poetry one may notice Mr.
John Free	PERSON	- man 's `` Stone Trees '' published by the new firm of
Selwyn	PERSON	and
Blount	PERSON	; while a volume is announced which will contain the verse of
A. W. St. Clair Tisdall	ORGANIZATION	, a young
Cambridge	LOCATION	man who , after a brilliant university career , died in the
Dardanelles	LOCATION
last year	DATE	in a heroic enterprise which won him a posthumous V. C .

		What his verse is like I do not know .

		Meanwhile , in strong and steady current , however the output of everything else may fluctuate , the war-books stream forth from the press .

		Spy-books and narratives by escaped governesses are fewer than they were .

		The product now falls into three main classes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- narratives of actual fighting , -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` indict - ments '' of the Germans , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- books dis - cussing the settlement at the end of the war .

		These last , the publishers say , are selling in thousands ; akin to them in appeal is
M. Eomain Holland	PERSON	's `` Above the Battle '' which is being widely read here and of which nearly fifty editions have appeared in
France	LOCATION	.

		Among the `` indictments '' the most serious is `` The Germans '' by Mr.
J. M. Eobertson	PERSON	, the politician and anti-Baconian controversialist .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's conclusions will , I suppose , be less appetizing to the Germans than to our - selves ; but his most hostile reader must admit the force of the chapters in which he demol - ishes practically every `` race-theory '' that has ever been invented , and bangs the skulls of the dolichocephals and the brachycephals against each other until there is no visible difference between them .

		A work of less learning , but equally remarkable in another way , is Mr.
Henry de Halsalle	PERSON	's `` Degenerate
Germany	LOCATION	, '' which for sustained invective has been equalled by no other war-book .

		This gentleman says `` airily '' that the Germans `` became cannibals '' in the seventeenth cen - tury ; that no German deserves the appellation `` lady '' or `` gentleman '' ; that Germans pick their teeth with forks in public ; that Germans relish bad smells and wash in the smallest pro- curable basins ; and that German literature is unprecedented in its immorality .

		As a pro- test against their impiety he makes the rev - erent suggestion that we should inscribe above the altars in our churches the text `` Father , forgive them not , for they know what they do . ''

		This book should have a conspicuous place in any museum of war-literature which may be established when
Europe	LOCATION	has got straight again .


London	LOCATION	,
April 10 , 1916	DATE	.

		J. C. SQUIRE .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE RECONSTRUCTION OF BELGIAN LETTERS , , ARTS , AND SCIENCES has been undertaken by certain philanthropists in this country , calling themselves the
Belgian Scholarship Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is nearly a year since this movement started , its object in the beginning being to raise money for the relief of destitute Belgian scholars ; but this aim has gradu - ally broadened , so that now the purpose is `` to give to the Belgian scholars , writers , and artists a chance
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 to resume their work of art or science , '' and `` to raise a fund for the reconstruction of a new and better
Belgium	LOCATION	, especially in the educational field . ''

		The first part of this twofold purpose is of a tem - porary character ; the second relates to the long future -LRB- it is hoped -RRB- of a restored
Belgium	LOCATION	, and is more important .

		Appeal is made to libraries and publishing houses and individuals for books , espe - cially duplicates that can be easily spared , and to learned societies and educational institutions for sets of their publications .

		But provisionally , and until the return of peace , promises only are desired , there being no present facilities for the receipt and storage of these gifts .

		Money , however , at the earliest moment , will be welcome for the immediate aid of Belgian scholars , writers , and artists , and for the creation of a substantial reconstruction fund ; and it is , in the committee 's words , '' the elite of the American people , '' those interested in the diffusion of knowledge and the growth of art , rather than the general public , that must be looked to for this aid .

		Associate membership in this band of workers is offered at
ten dollars	MONEY	a year during the war and for two years thereafter , sustaining membership at one hundred dollars annually , and fellowship at one thousand dollars annually .

		Remittance should be made to Mr.
John Joy Edson	PERSON	, Treasurer , 309
Wilkins Bldg.	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		Mr.
Nevil Monroe Hopkins	PERSON	is chairman of the committee , and Professor
George Sarton	PERSON	, of the
University of Ghent	ORGANIZATION	, but at present in
Washington	LOCATION	, is secretary .

		A CORRESPONDENT OP THE OLD SCHOOL , eminent in the art of writing something more than mere news bulletins such as the modern press agency sends forth from all parts of the world to all parts of the world ,
George Washburn Smalley	PERSON	, who died in
London	LOCATION	on the
fourth of this month	DATE	, leaves a long and enviable record of journalistic achieve - ment .

		He was born in
1833	DATE	at
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		`` My Memoirs , '' he writes in opening bis `` Anglo - American Memories , '' a substantial two-volume retrospect , `` begin with that
New England	LOCATION	of fifty years ago and more which has pretty well passed out of existence .

		I knew all or nearly all the men who made that generation famous : Everett ;
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, ' the whitest soul I ever knew , ' said
Emer	PERSON	- son ;
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	; Garrison ;
Andrew	PERSON	, the greatest of the great ' War Governors ' ;
Emerson	LOCATION	;
Wendell Holmes	PERSON	;
Theodore Parker	PERSON	;
Lowell	LOCATION	, and many more ; and of all I shall presently have some - thing to say . ''

		What he says is well worth reading , as is also his earlier book , `` Studies of Men . ''

		So long and actively had he mingled with men who were making history that his reminiscences of those men had more than a personal or biographical interest .

		In education he was a product of both
Yale	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard	LOCATION	, the former having given him his academic training , the latter his professional outfit ; for before he entered upon journalism he both studied and for five years practised law .

		But the Civil War claimed his energies as correspond - ent from the front for the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune . ''

		Later he became a member of that journal 's edi - torial staff , then organized its European bureau in
London	LOCATION	, and had charge of its European corre - spondence until
1895	DATE	, when he accepted the post of American correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		| Ten years ago he retired from active journalism , though continuing to write occasionally for the j
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' which published serially his `` Anglo-American Memories , '' and for magazines .

		!

		In
1878	DATE	he spared enough time from journalism to serve as Special Commissioner of the
United States	LOCATION	at the
Paris Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		He compiled a volume of Blight 's speeches in
1868	DATE	, and wrote a `` Life of Sir
Sidney Waterlow	PERSON	''
forty years later	DATE	.

		BOOKSHELVES IN EVOLUTION have in no single treatise received the exhaustive study that might be given to the subject .

		From the solidly built wall - bookcase to the skeleton construction of steel that graces the modern bookstack and adjusts itself to volumes of varying sizes , is a considerable advance in utility and in beauty .

		The development of the book-rest , or reading-desk , that sprang from the wall at right-angles in such manner as to receive necessary light from an adjacent window , into the tier of shelves abutting against the wall , was an early step in bookshelf - evolution ; but the rigidly - built , non-adjustable wooden shelving was a long time in giving way to the present-day adaptable construction .

		No rational system of book-classifica - tion and book-arrangement was easily possible under such primitive conditions .

		Our oldest circu - lating library , that founded by
Franklin	PERSON	and his associates in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1731	DATE	, continued for more than a century and a half to classify its books , with rough-and-ready simplicity , as folios , quartos , octavos , and duodecimos , shelving them merely according to size .

		This rude classification effected much saving of space , but served no other purpose , unless it were to promote in the librarian , as it certainly did in the instance of
Lloyd P. Smith	PERSON	, an extraordinary development of the `` bump of locality '' in respect to the many separate works on a single subject in the large and constantly growing collection .

		Wooden shelves supported by wooden pegs inserted in holes in the uprights , and thus capable of being raised or lowered at will , were a step in the right direction ; and the modern steel shelf , of open-bar construction and easily adjustable , is the logical continuation of the move ^ ment toward a strong and flexible and dustless system of shelving .

		The styles of bookstack offered by different manufacturers , with remarks on library equipment by librarians of experience , will be found in the current issue of the `` Library Jour - nal '' by any seeker after knowledge and useful information in this technical branch of library lore .

		THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL , as the afflicted author of `` Invictus '' might not inappropriately be called , is conspicuous among the choice spirits admirably portrayed by Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	in her `` Nights , '' a book for the elect , of the elect , and by one of the elect as will be found more fully set forth on a later page .

		Henley must have been a terror to those whom he opposed , or who opposed him , but at this distance of time and place one can admire the 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	uprightness and downrightness of the man and the invincibility of his courage and spirit under grievous physical infirmity .

		`` Rarely has a man so hampered by his body kept his spirit so gay , '' says Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	.

		`` He was meant to be a splendid creature physically , and fate made him a helpless cripple who was it once described him as ' the wounded Titan ' ?

		Everybody knows the story : he made sure that everybody should by telling it in his ' Hospital Verses . '

		But everybody can not know who did not know him how bravely he accepted his disaster .

		It seemed to me characteristic once when a young cousin of mine , a girl at the most suscep - tible age of hero-worship , meeting him for the first time in our chambers and volunteering , in the absence of anybody else available , to fetch the cab he needed , thought his allowing her to go on such an errand for him the eccentricity of genius and never suspected his lameness until he stood up and took his crutch from the corner .

		There was noth - ing about him to suggest the cripple . ''

		Possibly if he had kept out of his verses all reference to his sturdy endurance of `` the bludgeonings of chance '' we should like him even better than we do .

		But on the other hand , if he had done so , how would his readers , or most of them , have known anything about that which now stirs their admiration ?

		THE CHILD AND HIS `` LiBEBRY '' might form the subject of an interesting and amusing and instruc - tive book such as has not yet been written .

		To the child the `` liberry '' is quite as often the borrowed book from the public collection of reading matter as it is the building and its contents , just as with his elders the word `` laundry '' means both the package of napery and underwear submitted for washing and also the establishment in which the washing is done .

		A passage from the current Report of the Maiden -LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library is here in place .

		Rapid increase in the number of juvenile borrowers has made necessary the build - ing of an addition , an exclusively children 's annex .

		Just before its occupancy Mr.
Fison	PERSON	, the librarian , reported : '' This department , which was considered crowded a year ago , shows an increase of
11 per cent	MONEY	in the circulation of books , and at times the help of three or four additional assistants has been required to look after the children .

		The largest day 's circulation was 621 .

		Forty-one per cent of the entire circulation of the main library was juve - nile .

		When we report that 11 per cent more chil - dren 's books were circulated , we ought to add that about 44 per cent more children have visited the rooms this year , for it is a universal custom that when a child comes to change his ' liberries , ' as he generally calls his books , he is sure to bring , at least , three others with him to see that it is properly done , and any boy or girl who can not muster three followers has no social standing : whatever . ''

		THE CREATOR OF
GALLAGHER	PERSON	AND VAN BIBBER , whose sayings and doings were interesting some appreciable fraction of the reading public a quar - ter of a century ago , has died suddenly in the very prime of life , but with a record of literary work to his credit that , in quantity and in good average quality , many a far older writer has failed to equal .


Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	was born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	, the son of
L. Clarke	PERSON	and
Rebecca Elaine	PERSON	-LRB- Harding -RRB-
Davis	PERSON	, both well known in the world of letters .

		After graduation from
Lehigh University	ORGANIZATION	and a special course of one year at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, he entered upon journalism , his father 's calling , and from that soon passed to the writing of fiction , his mother 's literary occupation .

		``
Gallagher	PERSON	, '' a story of newspaper life , is said to have achieved thirteen rejections before its lucky acceptance by `` Scribner 's Magazine , '' after which its author had little experience of editorial rebuffs .

		War-correspondence , novel-writing , short stories , plays , descriptions of travel , tales for children all these have claimed his energies , and in all his work he has been successful in pleasing the popu - lar taste .

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' and the
New York	LOCATION	`` Herald '' secured his services as war correspond - ent , and he saw actual fighting and described it in his reports on the Turko-Greek , the Spanish - American , the South African , and the
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese wars .

		He was , at the time of his death , on
April 11	DATE	, a Fellow of the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, a member of the
Aero Club of America	ORGANIZATION	, and also a member of the
Explorers '' Club of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		The list of his books is too long to give here , and too easily accessible , in books of refer - ence and in library catalogues , to require any such detailed mention .

		A GIFT OF LINCOLN MANUSCRIPTS of no Small value has been made to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Clarence L. Hay	PERSON	, and another of almost equal interest by Miss
Helen Nicolay	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	, acting for himself and sisters , presented two drafts of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , one of which the speaker is said to have held in his hand when he delivered that memorable oration .

		Perhaps the familiar legend of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's reading that speech from the backs of old envelopes pressed into service at the last moment will now be either confirmed or refuted .

		The draft of the second inaugural address was also handed to Librarian Putnam by Mr.
Hay	PERSON	.

		These three autograph manuscripts had belonged to the late Secretary
John Hay	PERSON	.

		Miss
Nicolay	PERSON	gave
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's autograph memorandum , prepared Au -
gust 23 , 1864	DATE	, when he thought his re-election in grave doubt and desired to forecast a plan of cooperation with the president-elect for the saving of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		This document , endorsed by the members of his cabinet and sealed , was opened and read to the cabinet after the election , and was preserved by his private secretary ,
John G. Nicolay	PERSON	, whose daughter now places it in the government 's keeping .

		COLLEGE VERSE may seldom attain the sublimities or the profundities , but within its proper domain of the youthfully buoyant , the brisk , the piquant , the humorous , and occasionally the gracefully sen - timental , it is not seldom excellent reading .

		For pure fun in rollicking rhyme what could be better than some of the verse in the
Harvard	LOCATION	`` Lampoon '' or any one of perhaps a dozen other similar mouth -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413 pieces of student wit and humor ?

		In what environ - ment but that of an American college could there have started such a periodical as `` The Purple Cow , '' which had its birth -LRB- not as a calf -RRB- at
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	nearly nine years ago ?

		A fit name , surely , for a humorous publication in a college of such bucolic surroundings as
Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	has been editing a volume of Princeton undergraduate verse , and his name on the title-page will serve as no slight attestation to the worth of the book 's contents .

		He goes so far as to say of these Princeton poems that they attain `` a higher standard than is found in similar works edited in
England	LOCATION	by
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	and
Quiller	PERSON	- Couch . ''

		This , if correctly reported , is no small praise .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	the cultivation of poetry has for ages been stimulated by the offer of prizes and honors to successful contestants , whereas in this country athletics rather than poetics has long been the one engrossing interest outside the prescribed academic pursuits , or rather to their exclusion in many instances .

		THE RETIREMENT OF A VETERAN PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH is announced as soon to take place at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Henry Augustin Beers	PERSON	, one of the oldest members of the Yale faculty , though still lacking more than a year of the scriptural three - score and ten , will bring his present labors to a close at the end of this college year .

		In
1880	DATE	he was appointed to the chair of English in the Shef - field Scientific School , and by virtue of seniority in this department he has for some time been its head in the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Four courses will have to be provided with other teachers at his retirement .

		That on `` New England Writers '' will next year be incorporated in Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	's course in `` American Literature . ''

		The lectures on
Milton	ORGANIZATION	will be given by Professor
Lawrence Mason	PERSON	, those on `` Aspects of the Drama '' by Mr.
A. I. Taft	PERSON	, and Dr.
S. T. Williams	PERSON	will handle the '' Selected Topics from the Literature of the Victorian Age . ''

		Professor Beers is best known to the reading public for his compilation , `` A Century of American Literature , '' issued in
1878	DATE	, his `` Sketch of English Literature , '' and his life of
N. P. Willis	PERSON	in the `` American Men of Letters '' series .

		As a magazine writer also his name is familiar , and what he has to say is more than likely to be well worth reading .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		BACONIAN METHODS OF CONTROVERSY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I know neither Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	nor Mr.
Basil Lupton	PERSON	, and have only a languid interest in the Shakespeare-Bacon question , believing that as long as we have the works to read and study it makes little difference whether they were written by `` the paltry actor '' or `` the wisest , brightest , meanest of mankind . ''

		But I have been much interested in the controversy between the two gentlemen referred to that has been going on in your columns , because Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	's letters furnish such admirable illus - trations of the methods of the controversialist intent only on winning an apparent victory , that from one point of view they may be regarded as masterpieces .

		Possibly you can find space for con - sideration , somewhat lengthy but made as brief as possible , of those methods .

		First : Misrepresenting an opponent 's state - ments and their purpose ; usually quite effective , 1 for few will look back to see what actually was said and why .

		Illustrations : Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	asserts in his review of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's `` The Greatest of Literary Problems '' -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Dec. 9	DATE	-RRB- that that writer `` selects for quotation only such allusions and references to the poet-dramatist about which there can be some doubt '' and `` suppresses or distorts '' evidence that `` Shakespeare was very frequently spoken of by his contemporaries . ''

		To support this serious charge , he shows that Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	rejects ; the testimony of
Chettle	LOCATION	,
Greene	PERSON	,
Heywood	LOCATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	, and
Heminge	ORGANIZATION	and Condell on irrelevant or unin - telligible grounds ; makes no mention of the inscription on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's monument ; and has not `` even so much as hinted at '' nine `` unequivocal references to Shakespeare as a poet . ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	makes no endeavor to refute the charge , but writes -LRB- issue of
Jan. 20	DATE	-RRB- , as though the references had been given as proof that the actor and the author were one and the same person , `` Mr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum 's reasoning would be paralleled by stringing together a number of passages in praise of
George Eliot	PERSON	's novels , and proceeding to argue that the author of the novels must have been a man of that name . ''

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	having failed in his letter published
February 17	DATE	to point out this misrepresentation , Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	in his communica - tion of
March 16	DATE	writes : `` Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	appears blind to my point that no amount of contemporary praise of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	plays and poems can be regarded as evidence of the author - ship . ''

		This is shrewd , for of course it looks as though he had the Doctor `` stumped . ''

		Several other illustrations of the use of this method could be cited ; but one , the most pro- nounced of all , must suffice .

		In the issue of
January 20	DATE	, Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	asserts that by unearth - ing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's deposition in the Bellott-Mount - joy lawsuit , Professor
Wallace	PERSON	`` unwittingly proved conclusively that the actor was unable to write , because lus name is written by a law clerk in law script , and the deponent made his mark beneath the signature . ''

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	then comments -LRB-
Feb. 17	DATE	-RRB- : `` No human being outside of a lunatic asylum , or a fit candidate for one , who has ever seen a facsimile of the deposition and the wit - ness 's signature can for a single moment entertain the belief that the abbreviated signature was written by the clerk who wrote the deposition .

		No sane person who knows anything of graphiol - ogy can for a moment doubt that the signature in question is an unquestioned Shakespeare auto - graph ; and that the deposition as well as the signature are in the hand-writing that was in general use at the time .

		Has Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	mistaken the lex script a for law script ?

		Furthermore , what Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	calls a ` mark ' beneath the signature 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	is only a small blot .

		Had the witness not been able to sign his name , the clerk would have written the name , and would have written the words ` his mark ' between the Christian name and the sur - name , in accordance with general usage . ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	thus answers -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- : `` Dr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum gives his case away when he admits that the body of the deposition .

		.

		and the signature are in the same hand-writing ... The signature is written by the law clerk , and the mark -LRB- dot or cross is immaterial -RRB- is added by the illiterate deponent Shakspere . ''

		This is excellent !

		See how by the simple transmogrification of `` in the hand-writing that was in general use at the time '' into `` in the same hand-writing '' the Doctor has been made to `` admit '' what he so roundly asserted no sane person could believe : how the `` blot '' has become a `` dot '' ; how the statement that had he written the signature the law clerk would have written `` the words ` his mark ' between the Christian name and the surname , in accordance with general usage '' is ignored ; and how the light and airy `` dot or cross is immaterial '' suggests that Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's main point is that the `` mark '' is not a cross , though in fact he made no reference whatever to a cross .

		If the reader is not com - pletely deceived , it is because even a controversialist has his limitations .

		Second : Stating so simply and positively as apparently to preclude all possibility of denial that an opponent has not done what in fact he has .

		This is a very common method , and is fre - quently very briefly characterized .

		Illustration : Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	having said -LRB-
Jan. 20	DATE	-RRB- that none of the contemporary writers cited in the review , `` with possibly one exception , identifies the author with the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor , '' Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	asserts -LRB-
Feb. 17	DATE	-RRB- that `` Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	is not telling the truth , '' and reminds him of ``
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's wholly unequivocal identification of Shakespeare with
Stratford	LOCATION	, '' `` the testimony of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's monument in
Stratford	LOCATION	, '' and
Leonard Digges	PERSON	's reference to that monument in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	replies -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- that `` he does not hesitate to say I am not telling the truth , yet he does not indicate where I am at fault . ''

		Third : Ignoring a principal point found incon - trovertible and treating a subsidiary matter as if it were the main point .

		Illustration : Among the references given in the review , Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	calls especial atten - tion to one in which `` the dramatist is unequivocally spoken of as an actor , '' a poem by
John Davies	PERSON	, `` To our English Terence , Mr.
Will	PERSON	: Shakespeare '' who `` plaid some kingly parts in sport . ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	writes -LRB-
Jan. 20	DATE	-RRB- that none of the authors cited by Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, `` with possibly one exception , identifies the author with the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor , and this possible exception is by no means a clear exception .

		The phrase ` our English
Terence	PERSON	' suggests a pseudonym , if the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	. ''

		Note the eloquent silence as to the quotation `` plaid some kingly parts in sport '' !

		Fourth : Raising an issue other than the one under consideration and endeavoring to divert the discussion to that the method recommended by
Schopenhauer	PERSON	to a controversialist who feels that he is being worsted .

		Illustration : Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	comments thus -LRB-
Feb. 17	DATE	-RRB- on the quotation from Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	just given : `` He refers to
John Davies	PERSON	's poem in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is spoken of as ` our English Terence , ' and says that if the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	then
Davies	PERSON	's allusion ` suggests a pseudonym . '

		This , then , proves nothing , and may be equivocal .

		It is amazing what wizardry an ` if exerts upon a Baconian . ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	then asserts -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- : `` The theory that the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	, is dismissed by Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	with a sneer , '' and then adds : `` A genuine literary student would be interested to know what
Cicero	PERSON	and other contemporary writers tell us of the subject . ''

		Of course , any `` sneer '' that may exist in Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's remarks is not at `` the theory that the
Terence	PERSON	plays were the work of
Caius Laelius	PERSON	, '' in which for aught that appears to the contrary he may be a firm believer ; and `` what
Cicero	PERSON	and other contemporary writers tell us of the subject , '' like `` the flowers that bloom in the
Spring	DATE	, '' has `` nothing to do with the case , '' the real question being , if this theory is to be brought into the discussion , what
John Davies	PERSON	thought about it and what reason he had for believing that his contemporaries would understand such a cryptic suggestion .

		But suggesting that Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	has sneered at the theory and lugging in
Cicero	LOCATION	may involve him in a discussion concerning it , and that troublesome quotation from
Davies	PERSON	may be lost in the shuffle .

		Fifth : Stating matters of mere opinion as if they were indisputable facts .

		Illustrations : The assertions -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- that
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's play proves that the application for the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	coat-of-arms was `` a subject of mirth at the time '' ; that `` many persons were in the secret '' that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was not the author of the plays attributed to him ; that
Greene	PERSON	's allusion to `` an upstart crow beautified with our feathers '' `` indicates the paltry actor strutting about decked out as a dramatic author '' ; that the quotation from
Nash	PERSON	is `` a hit at
Bacon	LOCATION	, a lawyer .

		.

		turning playwright '' ; that
Bacon	PERSON	and
Jonson	PERSON	composed the
Leonard Digges	PERSON	verses in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	and the inscription on the Shakespeare monument , and that they worked `` to put the public on a wrong scent , '' not one of which assertions is believed by the vast majority of Shakespearean scholars .

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	's animating principle seems to be `` I believe it , therefore it is an indisputable fact , '' rather than `` It is an indisputable fact , therefore I believe it . ''

		Sixth : In default of evidence or argument , put - ting forth an obiter dictum confidently as though it were a generally recognised truth , and , if occa - sion offers , repeating it more elaborately .

		The confident tone will impose on some readers and the particularity on others .

		Illustrations : Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	says -LRB-
Dec. 9	DATE	-RRB- that the Baconians `` exasperate the orthodox Shakespearean by spelling the Stratfordian 's name ' Shakspere . ' ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	replies -LRB-
Jan. 20	DATE	-RRB- : `` Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's displeasure does not alter the fact that the difference does exist '' `` between the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 415 actors name ,
Shakspere	LOCATION	, and the author 's pseudo - nym , Shakespeare or Shake-speare , '' `` and it exists quite as clearly as the difference between
Tannen	PERSON	- baum and
Rosenbaum	PERSON	. ''

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	replies -LRB-
Feb. 17	DATE	-RRB- : `` I have yet to see any evidence that `
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	' was a pseudonym .

		As to Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	's confident assertion that ` Shakspere ' and ` Shakespeare ' are essentially different names , I venture to say that his confidence is probably in inverse proportion to his knowledge of the sub - ject . ''

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	makes no attempt to supply the evidence that Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	has `` yet to see , '' but instead gives -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- the pronun - ciation , an alternative spelling that `` proves '' it , and a possible derivation of `` the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor 's name ` Shakspere ' '' and the pronunciation , an alternative spelling that `` proves '' it , and a derivation of `` the author 's pseudonym , '' Shake - speare .

		Of course , the differentiation is a modern invention , to uphold which there must be explained away the facts that the first of `` The Names of the Principall Actors in all these Playes '' that precedes the list of plays in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	is
William '' Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' and that `` Shakespeare '' is the name that is signed to one of the folios of Shake - speare 's will , tliat appears on the
Stratford	LOCATION	monu - ment , in the reference to that monument in
Digges	LOCATION	's poem in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, and `` in the grant of arms in
1596	DATE	, in the license to the players of
1603	DATE	, and in the text of all the legal documents relating to the poet 's propertv . ''

		-LRB- Lee 's
Life of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, page 285 -RRB- .

		These , then , are Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	's methods , as any one can easily verify by reference to the issues of THE DIAL of
December 9	DATE	,
January 20	DATE	,
Febru	PERSON	- ary 17 , and
March 16	DATE	.

		What is it that actuates the `` Baconians and anti-Willians '' anyhow ?

		Is it fondness for fair play , desire to do justice , and a sincere and disinterested love of truth for its own sake ?

		Mr.
Lupton	PERSON	says -LRB-
March 16	DATE	-RRB- that `` dear old Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	.

		.

		used to get quite angry when he saw nail after nail of modern reasoning and research driven into the coffin of the man of Strat - ford '' ; if his own letters are specimens of the `` modern reasoning and research , '' it must have been something other than the feeling that `` nail after nail '' was being `` driven into the coffin of the man of
Stratford	LOCATION	'' that made the good Doctor `` quite angry . ''

		Nails !

		Why , they are not even brass tacks !

Berkeley	LOCATION	, Col. ,
April 14 , 1916	DATE	.

		IN PEAISE OF `` SPOON BIVEB . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have noted a communication in your issue of
March 30	DATE	recording the reactions of one of your readers to the `` Spoon River Anthology '' by Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	.

		`` Spoon River '' needs no apologia .

		Yet there seem to be some who , like your correspondent , crave an apologia , some who , not finding one in the accepted oracles of criticism , vacillate and are half inclined to think that the book can be dismissed after all with a curt refer - ence to `` reptile , '' `` slime , '' `` vulgarity , '' and `` sexual psychology . ''

		It is a satisfaction to answer the challenge of doubt by a statement of personal con - viction ; and without speaking for anyone but myself , I venture an explanation of why I believe `` Spoon River '' is not Death , but Life .

		Briefly , it is because I believe it a sign of weak - ness , of morbidity , when the reader demands of his literature a presentation of life more whole - some and more idealistic than life itself .

		To crave a coloring or varnishing of the truth instead of the truth itself is to confess an intellectual disease ; and to yield utterly to that craving , to shut out !

		of one 's vision the spectacle of folly and ironic fate and wrong , is to become a spiritual invalid , a dead soul .

		Because our literature is full of a decadent sen - timentality , glossing over the black horrors of a chaotic universe , minimizing them , palliating them , denying them , finding pretext after pretext for extracting a far-fetched right out of an unadul - terated wrong , one turns from it as from the tempered and medicated atmosphere of a hospital to the cold air of a world where men can face facts .

		And such a world one finds in `` Spoon River . ''

		Can anyone deny that things do happen as they happen in `` Spoon River '' ?

		Or must one j deny it because no comforting assurance that the evil deserved their fate or that the good are to be rewarded in another world is appended to each confession ?

		Of course , if one gazes at the fiends and their victims in
Malebolge	LOCATION	, it is a relief to ' have the liquid Italian lines to reassure him that !

		it is all the operation of a mysterious justice .

		It ' is but natural , too , that a man seeing about him a real world as hellish in some of its corners as Malebolge should summon , in the veriest panic , , the sophistical philosopher , the smooth-spoken parson , or the dreaming poet to furnish the pre - texts or the illusions he requires .

		So coddled and drugged , he finds living endurable .

		From the writer who bids him look on the stark reality of one tragedy , unredeemed by pageantry or an appearance of justice or promises of compensa - tion , he withholds the title of literature .

		Perhaps , evading the issue , he withholds it on the flimsy pretext that the form is not that of what he has been accustomed to call poetry .

		Let the quibbler have his way : let him call it puckery or piggery or pork-packery ; but will he deny its likeness to a part of the living world ?

		After all , why are
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	and Words - worth cried up for a Return to Nature as vocifer - ously as Zola ,
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Masters	PERSON	are cried down for a Return to Reality ?

		It is not because
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	excluded the trivial , the tawdry , the cloacaline , but because they were willing to furnish the spiritual anaesthetics that left one in a cheerful frame of mind .

		The vulgarity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is pardoned because it is i laughable .

		The appalling catastrophes of `` Lear , '' `` Othello , '' and `` Hamlet '' are found to be not only endurable but also edifying because
Eternal Justice	ORGANIZATION	is exemplified , first , in the fact that the i evil are involved with the good in their fall ; and , secondly , in the fact that the vices of the good ,
Lear	PERSON	's lack of insight , Othello 's rash trustfulness , and
Hamlet	ORGANIZATION	's speculative itch , found in agony and death a chastisement richlv deserved .

		In 416
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 27	DATE	Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's book , the trivial and disgusting are not pardoned because they are treated with `` high seriousness . ''

		The catastrophes and mockeries of circumstance which he depicts are not considered edifying because he does not allow the reader to discover the consoling circumstance , the vindicating theory , which reconciles him to the world as it is .

		Let us cease our clamor for a literature which reads into the world some cosmic idealism , which finds a sublime destiny in the drunkard 's last delirium , in the embrace of the jaded street-walker , in the demoniac task of the stoker , in the con - vulsive breathing of the gas-poisoned soldier , in the blighting of child life in the sweat shop and factory .

		Let us say to ourselves : `` No casuistry will obliterate , no dreams obscure , no religion glorify , these horrors .

		What are we going to do about it ? ''

		Arrived at that stage , perhaps we shall turn the enormous force of our wasted ener - gies , wasted in soul salves and trifling reforms , into the task of tasks , the transformation of the world as it is into a world which will need no apologies , no discreet concealments , a world not unworthy of a God .

		We shall be skeptical of the power of passing Pippas or
Third Floor Backs	ORGANIZATION	to work miracles on whole communities , or of social settlements to combat by magic the organic operation of the forces of greed , ignorance , and vice .

		I do not belittle such influences , and am far from opposing them .

		But to see in them the hope of the future is grossly to under-estimate the task .

		What concrete steps the awakened power and vision of humanity will take to abolish poverty , to answer the needs of sex , to afford expression to the higher capacities of all , it is not for me here to speak , and the suggestions of to-day will seem the puerilities of the next century .

		But we may be sure of one thing that will characterize that constructive age : it will not demand of its litera - ture the blinking of any reality whatsoever ; if it , demands the `` noble and profound application of ideas to life , '' it will not accept as such the vapor - ings of any well-meaning man with an imagination and a gift for language , who discovers felicities where they do not exist and extenuates unnecessary and appalling ills ; who rhapsodizes about airy abstractions like Duty , Liberty , and the Will , with - out any scientific analysis or any full realization of their application to any concrete problem ; who , in short , offers the ideas he has read into life instead of the ideas he has read out of life .

		In that day , we may believe , `` Spoon River '' will be read as a book that faithfully mirrored a micro - cosm palpitant with vitality , that did not blink the worms that grope through ordure , or dim the splendor of those energies that now seem groping too , but which , we may reasonably hope , if they are redirected , will evolve a new world .

		R ' S '
LOOMIS	PERSON	- IS BACON NOT `` SHAKE-SPEAEE '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issues of
Dec. 9	DATE	and
March 2	DATE	, Mr.
Samuel A. Tannenbaum	PERSON	replies to the following anti-Shaksperians , Mr.
James P. Baxter	PERSON	and Mr.
George G. Greenwood	PERSON	respectively .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book , `` The Greatest of Literary Problems , '' con - tains in its last pages which Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	purposely avoids answering -LRB- because it `` deals with ciphers , '' etc. -RRB- an explanation of .

		a point that has clearly baffled both Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	and Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	.

		In replying to Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's recently pub - Isihed book , `` Is There a Shakespeare Problem ? ''

		Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	takes issue with Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's contention that a verse in the
1604	DATE	Quarto Edition of `` Hamlet '' shows the author to have been a classical scholar conversant with the view of Aristotle and other philospohers that there can be no motion without sense , or sense without a soul .

		The `` Hamlet '' quarto verse is as follows : `` Sence sure you have Els could you not have motion . ''

		Taking with Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	the word `` sence '' to include mental faculties , the error of the philosophy just expressed is manifest to any who have seen a snake 's tail move after its severance from the body .

		So that Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	is right in saying that the passage is inane -LRB- more espe - cially in connection with the `` Hamlet '' context -RRB- , and Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	is right in implying that the author was misled by a `` classical '' error .

		Neither calls attention to the fact that the Folio Edition of `` Hamlet '' omitted these lines , and that is where Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's wider view clears up the matter , as your readers will find on pages 497-8 of his book , where he shows that the omission of this verse from the
1623	DATE	`` Hamlet '' was coincident with
Bacon	PERSON	's correction in the
1623	DATE	edition of his `` Advancement of Learning '' -LRB- or `` Augmeutis '' -RRB- of the `` classical '' view expressed in the
1605	DATE	edition thereof that `` in the absence of sense there can be no motion . ''

		In the
1623	DATE	edition ,
Bacon	PERSON	states that `` ignorance drove some of the ancient philos - ophers to suppose that a soul was infused into all bodies without distinction ; since they could not conceive how there could be motion at discretion without _ sense , or sense without a soul . ''

		It seems to me that Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	has raised the real question as to this point when he says : `` In the First Folio of the ' Shakespeare ' Works pub - lished the same year , the lines from the earlier Hamlet were left out .

		By whom and why were they cancelled if not by
Bacon	PERSON	, who was then see - ing his ` Augmentis ' through
Jaggard	PERSON	's press '' ?

		That is the question for your readers to decide before concluding that
Bacon	PERSON	is not `` Shakespeare . ''

		LEISURE HOTTRS OF A -LSB- LITERARY LIFE .

		* More than seventeen centuries ago
Aulus Gellius	PERSON	gave to the world his `` Noctes Atticae , '' somewhat less than a century ago
John Wilson	PERSON	-LRB- or
Christopher North	PERSON	, as he called himself in literature -RRB- was busy with his `` Noctes Ambrosianse , '' and now we have another book of a similar title though of a different char - acter from either of these , a volume of `` Nights '' by Mrs.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, which , to establish a sort of kinship with the other two , we might call `` Noctes Pennellianse . ''

		It gives us the nocturnal diversions of the gifted artist and his equally , though differently , gifted wife in the four European cities ,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	, where Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	were at one time and another busily engaged by day in filling commissions , to the subsequent satisfaction of magazine - readers and others , and less strenuously occupied after nightfall in cultivating a con - siderable number of desirable friendships .

		Conventional
Philadelphia	LOCATION	breeding and re - spectable
Philadelphia	LOCATION	traditions seem to have been subjected to some little violence in the bohemianizing process wrought by these inno - cently mirthful , harmlessly convivial Roman and Venetian ,
London	LOCATION	and Parisian nights .

		The late hours , extending into early morning hours , kept by the choice spirits with whom these expatriated Philadelphians consorted as by a kind of natural affinity , were not the best preparation for a following day of diligent toil at desk or easel ; but one can not doubt that they were worth all they cost .

		Their later fruit , at least , in the agreeable literary and artistic and personal reminiscences now put into book form , is something to be unre - servedly thankful for .

		Taking the nights in the order of their rehearsal , let us make our first dip into the book in the Roman section and join the Pennells and sundry others at the home of the artist
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	and his wife : There was little of Ms work to see , for his studio was some distance from his apartment .

		But it was enough to see
Vedder	PERSON	himself or , for that matter , enough to hear him .

		In his own house he led the talk , even Forepaugh -LSB- a fictitious name -RSB- having small chance against him .

		He was a prolific , a splendidly determined and animated talker .

		It was stimulating just to watch him talk .

		He was never still , he rarely sat down , he was always moving about , walking up and down , at times breaking into song and even into dance .

		He was then in his prime , large , with NIGHTS .

Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The true American never gets Europeanized , nor does he want to , however long he may stay on the wrong side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		When I was with
Vedder	PERSON	, Broadway always seemed nearer than the Corso .

		He had recently finished the illustrations for the Eubaiyat and the book was published while we were in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		It was never long out of his talk .

		He would tell us the history of every design and of every model or pot in it .

		He exulted in the stroke of genius by which he had invented a composition or a pose .

		I have heard him describe again and again how he drew the flight of a spirit from a model , outstretched and flopping up and down on a feather bed laid upon the studio floor , until she almost fainted from fatigue , while he worked from a hammock slung just above .

		Instances follow of the artist 's high esteem for
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who is incorrectly referred to as `` Fitzgerald '' -RRB- , especially his rejoicing `` in the story of Dr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	filling a difficult tooth for the Queen and all the while singing the praises of the Eubaiyat until she ordered a copy of the edition de luxe . ''

		From the Venetian section a reviewer can - not do better than to quote a passage concern - ing the brilliant and eccentric genius whom the writer was destined to see much of in the near future and , with her husband 's collabora - tion , to make the subject of a notable biography .

		It was extraordinary how the
Whistler	LOCATION	tradition had developed and strengthened in the little more than four years since he had left
Venice	LOCATION	.

		I had never met him then , though J. had a few months before in
London	LOCATION	.

		I hardly hoped ever to meet him ; I cer - tainly could not expect that the day would come when he would be our friend , with us constantly , letting us learn far more about him and far more intimately than from all the talk at a cafe table of those who already know him , accepted him as a master , and loved him as a man .

		But had my knowledge of him come solely from those months in
Venice	LOCATION	I should still have realized the power of his personality and the force of his influence .

		He seemed to pervade the place , to colour the atmosphere .

		He had stayed in
Venice	LOCATION	only about a year .

		In the early eighties little had been written of him except in contempt or ridicule .

		But to the artist he had become as essentially a part of
Venice	LOCATION	, his work as inseparable from its associations , as the Venetian painters like
Carpaecio	PERSON	and Tintoretto who had lived and worked there all their lives and about whom a voluminous literature had grown up , culminating in the big and little volumes by
Buskin	PERSON	, upon which the public crowding to
Venice	LOCATION	based their artistic creed .

		Any exaggeration in this estimate of Whis - tler 's Venetian fame will be readily pardoned .

		Anything is better than to damn one 's friends with faint praise .

		In the considerable section devoted to
London	LOCATION	there occurs , among other pleasing pen-portraits , this of the amiable and talented though strangely taciturn Phil
May	DATE	: Neither his books nor his silence , however original and personal , could have been the cause of the charm he undoubtedly possessed .

		I think he was one of the people whom one feels are nice instinctively , without 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	any reason .

		He was sympathetic and responsive , serious when the occasion called for it , foolish when folly was in order .

		It was n't only in his drawings that he was ready to wear the cap and bells .

		I know an artist , one of whose cherished memories of
Phil May	PERSON	is of the Christmas Eve when they both rang Lord
Leigh	PERSON	ton 's door-bell and ran away and back to
Phil May	PERSON	's studio on the other side of the road , and
Phil May	PERSON	was as pleased as if it had been a master - piece for Punch .

		In the spirit of gay and frivolous
Paris	LOCATION	is j the following extract from the Parisian por - tion of the book .

		The writer and her com - panion were young at the time of this joyous first sojourn in the French capital : Occasionally we dined joyously beyond our means , and one memorable year we devoted our nights to giving each other dinners where the best dinners were to be had .

		Those alone who are blest with little money and the obligation of making that little can appreciate the splendour of our recklessness , just as those alone who work all day and eat sparingly can have the proper regard for a good dinner .

		I do not regret the recklessness , I am not much the poorer for it to-day whatever I was at the time , and I should have missed something out of life had I not once dined recklessly in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Thus in bright and cheery vein does Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	write of those memorable European nights , wisely forgetting , for the time being , whatever hardships and anxieties entered into the days .

		Her playfellow and co-worker in those nights and days contributes of his art to the embellishment of the volume , which is further illustrated from photographs and otherwise .

		It is a thoroughly wholesome and enjoyable piece of work , personally reminis - cent -LRB- or one might say gossipy -RRB- without malice , and anecdotal without triviality .

		SOCIAL , JUSTICE AXD RELIGIOUS EVOLUTION .

		* To the innumerable company of simple folk who , in these troublous times , are daily groan - ing under the burden of an unintelligible world , the recently published little book , `` The Struggle for
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Louis Wallis	PERSON	, following upon the same author 's larger work , `` A Sociological Study of the Bible , '' to which it forms an addendum , will serve to illuminate some of the dark places in our historical retrospect , and to throw a ray of light upon the path to be followed in the immediate future .

		In the older parts of the world , the struggle for justice is not , as in
America	LOCATION	, a thing of modern growth .

		The effort of labor to free itself from the tyranny of privilege is as old as history , and is first brought to light * THE STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE .

		By
Louis Wallis	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE BIBLE .

		By
Louis Wallis	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		in human records in the account of the revolt of
Israel	LOCATION	against his taskmasters the Egyp - tians , under the leadership of that greatest and gentlest of labor-agitators the world has ever seen , Moses the Jewish Law-giver .

		There can be little doubt in the mind of the thought - ful and impartial student of history that this perpetual internecine warfare has been the real cause , underlying those that appear on the surface , of the rhythmic rise and fall of empires in the far-distant past .

		The enslave - ment of the common people , and the engender - ing of a political dry-rot among the ruling classes through the spread of idleness and luxury ; the growth of a swollen and top - heavy condition with an outward appearance of health and an inward condition of corrup - tion ; a revolt from below and an unsteady resistance from above ; a violent shaking of the substratum and the collapse of the super - structure , such has been for the most part the record of the decline and fall of civiliza - tions since the beginning of written history .

		Such , in brief , is the tale of `` the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	and the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		To those who have sufficient vision to dis - cern the signs of the times , and into whose consciousness recent European events are being burned as by a branding-iron , it is becoming increasingly clear that the old world is at this moment paying the penalty of its age-long indifference to the demands of the workers for justice .

		It seems as though for
Europe	LOCATION	the day of reckoning has come .

		The god Nemesis has presented her bill and de - mands instant settlement .

		It should not be difficult for those who can look beyond prox - imate to original causes , to perceive that in the threatened or impending revolts from beneath , which seemed two years ago to en - danger the internal stability of each one of the belligerent nations , are to be found the real reasons why
Europe	LOCATION	is now weltering in blood .

		Had
Justice	ORGANIZATION	ruled in each of the war - ring countries ; had the resources of each country been open to the effort of all the citi - zens in each country ; had general content - ment reigned alongside of each monarch on his throne ; had every honest man sat securely under his own vine and fig tree , none daring to make him afraid , such an inhuman spec - tacle as we are now witnessing would have been impossible , indeed , unthinkable .

		The question , therefore , which is probably press - ing itself upon those European minds that are sufficiently freed from the asphyxiating influ - ence of national passions to be capable of thinking , is not as to when and how the war may terminate , or as to what form a treaty of peace may assume , but as to whether the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 419 nations that have been involved in the strug - gle may have sufficient vision to interpret the teaching of destiny aright .

		Will the suffering peoples learn that to go on perpe - trating social injustice is to defy the inexor - able laws of the universe ; that it is to pile up a debit-balance that must assuredly one day be wiped out ; that it is to accumulate explosive material that must ultimately , by spontaneous combustion if not by accident , result in disastrous conflagration ?

		And what lesson does this world-tragedy contain for the neutral nations , and especially for this greatest among neutrals , the
United States	LOCATION	?

		This is just the question that Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	's two books should bring vividly to the mind of every thoughtful and patriotic American .

		Must we complete our apprenticeship in the art of right living by going through the same experiences of blundering and suffering , or may we learn in time that the laws of the universe are pledged to social justice , and that we violate these laws at our peril ?

		America is in a peculiar sense at the parting of the ways , and those who most deeply love her institutions and ideals will most earnestly hope for such a national heart-searching as will reveal to her whether or not she is follow - ing in the footsteps of those countries whose accumulated sins are now being expiated on fields of blood .

		In the `` foreword '' to `` The Struggle for
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	points out the interesting and extremely significant fact that two great movements , which to the casual thinker may seem to have no obvious relationship to each other , are converging to the same objective , like two rivers flowing together to form a larger stream .

		These are the awakening of the social conscience to the need for economic justice , and the modern re-interpretation of the religion of the Bible .

		It is upon these two movements that our Western civilization must rely for its preservation or escape from the catastrophe that has invariably overtaken its predecessors , even those that have attained to the highest point of distinction in com - merce , science , art , and literature .

		And the value of such a sociological study as Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	has given us lies just in this , that it reveals the close association which necessarily exists between the religion of dogmas and creeds and that form of society in which land-monopoly and privilege dominate the lives of the common people ; and it reveals the equally vital or organic connection be - tween the religion of social morality and the freer political institutions towards which mankind have always been struggling .

		In every age there has been a `` New Theology '' alongside of a `` New Sociology , '' the one being a revolt against the tyranny of dogmatic re - ligion , and the other a bursting of the political and economic trammels that had circum - scribed the life of the people .

		What distin - guishes this double movement in the twentieth century from all similar movements that have preceded it is that it is now supported as it never has been before by knowledge and understanding of the art of Biblical and his - torical interpretation , on the one hand , and of the science of economics on the other .

		It is strange indeed that we should so per - sistently have taken for granted that our primitive forefathers were possessed of an inherent tendency to metaphysical specula - tion , and that the religion of early races grew out of a desire to solve the riddle of the universe .

		If the method of ^ plaining the past by observation of the processes we see in operation around us in the present is the method suggested by pure reason , then the assumption that our remote and unlettered ancestors evolved their religion out of their unsuccessful efforts to transcend the finite and to comprehend the infinite must be ruled out of court .

		For we now see plainly that I the habit of metaphysical speculation is not natural to the genus homo except in his later and more complex developments .

		The natural , healthy , well-fed man has no immediate im - pulse toward theology , philosophy , or mys - ticism .

		The speculative instinct , like the aesthetic or mathematical faculties , only asserts itself after a substantial beginning has been made in the life that is based upon animal sensation , and in the construction of the intellectual machinery by which it is regulated .

		Why , then , should we have assumed that , while in our own days only the few leisured and educated among us have a tendency to look beyond the life of the passing day , the common people of remote ages soared among the immensities and eterni - ties out of mere love of theological specula - tion ?

		The assumption is obviously not a reasonable one , and can only have arisen through causes which we have not hitherto clearly diagnosed .

		Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	, in his `` Social Evolu - tion , '' has propounded a theory which seems to provide an answer to this question .

		In the early days of social development , he points out , the interests of the race were sharply opposed to the personal interests of the indi - viduals composing the race-group .

		From the point of view of that cosmic energy to which by a mental necessity we are compelled to attribute a personal volition , and which urges humanity to the conquest of the earth and 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	to the highest development of his powers in the arts and sciences , it was absolutely essen - tial that men should be compelled to toil by some power external to themselves , some power stronger than the mere force of hunger that impels the animal to seek for food .

		In other words , it was necessary that the few strong men of exceptional intelligence should enslave the many and compel them to obedi - ence , it was necessary that injustice should provide the first stepping-stone to the higher life of society .

		It is evident that this hypo - thesis places the interests of the race and those of the vast majority of individuals at any given time in direct opposition to each other .

		The interests of the hive involve the complete subordination of the great army of individual bees who from generation to gener - ation have occupied the hive .

		But why , it may be asked , should men have submitted to this subordination of their own interests to the future interests of the race , a future in which , as individuals , they could have no part or share ?

		Eeason gave no sanction to it .

		By the appeal to force , the bands of slavery in all its forms could have been burst asunder in their earliest stages .

		But the power that rules human destiny seems rigorously to have determined that the interests of the race must be supreme , and so a supra-rational sanction had to be discovered for the subordination of the individual , a sanction that would be above and independent of reason ; and that sanction was found in the religion of dogma or authority , the religion which rests upon an assumed command of supernatural beings .

		The early structure of society , in short , neces - sitated a system of theology which postulated an external authority which was supposed to have ordered this subordination of the mass of men to the few powerful spirits among them ; and so there arose that complex hier - archy of gods and demons , with their com - mandments and creeds and dogmas , to whom was attributed supreme power over the des - tinies of the race .

		The hypothesis may be expressed thus : given a certain economic or industrial form of society , there must evolve a certain system of theology to correspond , a system which will profess through its creeds and dogmas to authorize the existing struct - ure of society , and which will serve to stifle the spirit of rebellion on the part of the sufferers under that structure .

		There is , in short , an organic connection between a religion of authority and dogmatism , and a structure of society which involves the abso - lute subordination of the many to the few .

		With this hypothesis before us , it is of exceeding interest to follow Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	in his elucidation of the circumstances that led up to the struggle of the Hebrew people for the worship of the one god , as opposed to the cults of the many gods who reigned in the temples of the great powers of the time .

		`` That struggle , '' says Mr.
`` Wallis	PERSON	, `` was not a mere theological contest between certain wise people who served a real God and certain foolish people who served unreal gods ?

		It was a warfare between the principles of jus - tice and injustice .

		The rise of monotheism and the downfall of polytheism spelled the triumph of the plain people over the aris - tocracy . ''

		This is indeed the burden of Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	's message to our time , as it is con - tained in the two books before us .

		What we have hitherto wrongly interpreted as a per - petual intellectual warfare between older and newer metaphysical systems was at bottom a continuous struggle between those in posses - sion of unjust privileges and those who suffered from that injustice .

		`` Such as were oppressed had no comforter , but on the side of the oppressor there was power . ''

		The fact that this struggle against economic oppression assumed the thought-forms it did assume , should not have blinded us to the truth that its purpose was to burst the manacles of slav - ery .

		The refusal to bow to a king and to kneel to a priest are at bottom identical , as being expressions of the question that man was bound sooner or later with advancing intelli - gence to ask himself , `` Why am I not free ? ''

		If we would see clearly on this matter we can not get too firmly into our minds the thought expressed in the words of Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	, `` Religion is always the reflection , or mirror , of the conventional usages and views of Society , '' and the realization of the fact that a revolt against the fetters of law and custom invariably manifests itself as a revolt against the religion associated with , and giving its authority to , these customs .

		How persistently this struggle between those on whose side was power and those who suffered and had no comforters , has gone on under all the changing forms of society and religious belief is impressively shown in the course of Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	's study of Hebrew his - tory .

		After the motley crowd of gods and goddesses who reigned in the temples had been dismissed , and the one true God was established on his eternal throne , the conflict between power and freedom expressed itself in a new form .

		`` As soon as Monotheism was established , a new struggle arose over the question , How is the One God to be served ? ''

		Then began that conflict that has been waged all through the succeeding ages between priest and prophet , between dogmatist and moralist ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 421 between orthodoxy and heterodoxy , between the upholders of ancient beliefs and the seekers after new truths .

		And the outstand - ing fact , the significance of which we are only now beginning dimly to perceive , is that the priest , the dogmatist , and the orthodox up - holder of things as they have been have invariably been ranged on the side of power and privilege ; while the moralist , the prophet , and the heterodox religionist have at all times been the supporters of the oppressed and dis - inherited .

		The agitation for justice in social relationships has never proceeded from the religion of dogma and authority , but always from the religious heretics , from those who believed that the One God was to be wor - shipped , not by giving credence to alleged happenings in the past or future or assent to certain creeds or dogmas , but by setting up principles of justice in human relationships .

		It seems as though it is by a true instinct that men have always felt the denial of ancient creeds to be the only possible method of approach to the double-sided problem of religion and politics , theology and sociology , the fatherhood of God .

		and the brotherhood of man .

		Apart from the appeal which Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	's two books make to every earnest social re - former , their intellectual value as contribu - tions to a right understanding of Hebrew history can hardly be over-estimated .

		The plain man seldom realizes that , despite the excellence of the translations we have been provided with , the idioms , images , and phrases in which the history of the Jews is conveyed to us are so foreign to our ordinary modern language as to constitute practically a different tongue .

		This is specially true of the writings of the later Hebrew prophets , but applies to some extent even to those of profane historians of the time of Josephus .

		We conse - quently fail to recognize that the unfamiliar form and phrasing in which the message is conveyed have obscured and blurred its mean - ing , and have left only the most hazy impres - sion on our minds as to the real order and significance of the historical happenings .

		Our indebtedness , therefore , is great to a student who has taken the trouble to focus the records through the lens of his own understanding , and to re-present them to us in a form which we can fully comprehend .

		Few among average book-readers in these days realize the deep human interest that attaches to the early history of the Jewish people .

		Not only have we inherited from that persecuted race our richest legacy in literature , poetry , and -LRB- when rightly inter - preted -RRB- early history , but it is to the Jewish race that we are indebted for the inception and conservation of the moral sentiment .

		To the Hebrew people we owe it that the torch of | ' loyalty to the idealized community '' was first ' lighted and has been kept burning through j the long darkness of heathenism .

		To the j Greeks we are indebted for that sentiment of I beauty which has played so large a part in the intellectual evolution of the human mind ; to the Romans we acknowledge our education in the uses of the sense of power in all the spiral forms through which m ^ n mounts to higher planes of being .

		But it is to that '' chosen people '' to whom the sense of justice was first revealed that we must place the credit of having through its seers and prophets preserved for future generations the highest conceptions of social righteousness the world has yet known .

		`` We commend these two books to the atten - tion of every sincere and humane student of sociology .

		Despite the sadness which always attends a candid survey of the blunderings of our poor humanity in the past , and despite the clamor and confusion of the present age in which that survey is made , Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	's pages are illumined by a persistent hopeful - ness , a rational optimism , a stubborn faith in the ultimate supremacy of righteousness .

		We can not do better than to close this imperfect review by quoting the author 's final sentence : `` There can be no doubt how the present strug - gle will end : the social gospel will triumph ; and the
Bible	LOCATION	, as explained by scientific scholarship , will stand at the centre of the greatest movement for justice and freedom that the world has ever seen . ''

		* There are in the main two causes of the present unfortunate lack of sympathy between the painter and the public .

		Mr.
Frederick Colin Tilney	PERSON	, an English painter , teacher , and critic , discusses them in the opening chapters of `` The Appeal of the Picture . ''

		One cause lies in the conditions of modern life .

		Leisure no longer exists .

		Contempla - tion is a lost faculty .

		Only novelty and the sensational attract attention , and that but for the moment .

		Legitimate art , unable by its very nature to traffic in novelty and sensation , thrives only in an age of greater calm .

		The other cause is to be sought in the painter 's art itself , as practised to-day .

		Two tendencies in contemporary painting have * THE APPEAL OF THE PICTUKE .

		An Examination of the Principles in Picture Making .

		By
Frederick Colin Tilney	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		422 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	gone far toward producing total estrangement of public from artist .

		There is , on the one hand , the scientific tendency .

		Since the inauguration of the luminarist movement upward of a hundred years ago , and particu - larly since its triumph in the eighties , such painters of the new school as have been really sincere have been so absorbed in the technique of light and color as almost to have forgotten the public in the overwhelming desire to please themselves and their fellow artists .

		The public mind , educated for generations in the language of the great masters , and looking to painting for a transcript of life , is filled with mystification and distrust before the ever shifting and contradictory mass of experi - mental effort , for the most part neglectful of subject matter and attentive to technique , that adorns the walls of the exhibition .

		On the other hand , there is the tendency toward the illegitimate and the insincere .

		These are the parasites of the scientific .

		The successful experimentation of the honest and conscientious artist has been followed by the haphazard experimentation of the insincere , the ignorant , and the self-interested .

		Walls are hung with easy imitations of successful innovators , or with startling originalities mak - ing desperate bids for notoriety .

		The indistinct drawing and the omission of detail inherent in the great impressionists have been made the excuse for and erected into the principle of bad drawing .

		The necessary or accidental strangeness of genius has been seized upon and made into virtue .

		Archaism , exoticism , naivete , unreality , unrecognizabil - ity , and actual ugliness , all have their cults .

		Mere newness and freshness of concept or execution have been exalted .

		Lack of genius , talent , or industry , unwillingness to submit to rules , the itch for notoriety , the desire for a market , have all joined voices in noisily avowed contempt for the traditional and undying qualities of art .

		The public , mysti - fied and distrustful before the more or less incomprehensible product of even the modern artist who is endowed with genius and sin - cerity , has ended by having added to its other emotions disgust at the self-conceit , self - assertion , and self - exploitation of quack artist and quack critic .

		In thus explaining the breach between pub - lic and painting , however , the author of `` The Appeal of the Picture '' does not rail .

		Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	's primary purpose is not to establish a theory ; his book is neither a satire nor a polemic , but a series of twenty-three very sober and very sensible and instructive chap - ters on such topics as the ordinary reader , whether artist or mere picture lover , delights in hearing discussed by the expert .

		These are some of his themes : the point of view of the public , subject-matter , size as a factor , tone , tonal effect , color , composition , realism and idealism , naturalism -LRB- by which he means not the photographic naturalism of literary criticism , for which he employs the term literalism , but the quality of existing or pos - sible reality -RRB- , mood , feeling , the romantic and the picturesque , landscape , impressionism , development , quality , mural painting , genre , portraiture , background , photography , archa - isms , fears and hopes .

		Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	is conservative , but temperate .

		He gives due credit to those who have repre - sented real progress in painting , opposing only the exaggerated claims of the extremists .

		He insists on the essential correctness and value of traditional principles .

		It behooves painters to be human like the old masters , he says , and to be artists like them also .

		The history of the world teaches us that it is usual for apostles of new creeds and starters of new move - ments to be over-zealous , as well as for their immedi - ate disciples to carry enthusiasm beyond reasonable bounds .

		They will not pause to ask whether the principles they are treading down and the styles they are throwing over are worth anything for the goodness and truth that is in them .

		Naturally all this causes consternation amongst the adherents to old principles ; and so it usually happens that a new regime begins with a reign of terror .

		And under the cloaking turmoil of a reign of terror there are to be found many who commit crimes in the name of liberty .

		They assume the cockade , and under the aegis of a veritable tri-colour , pass as being in the movement .

		Without assimilating its matter they make a brave show with its manner .

		Their voice is raised in strident tones in order that those who can not judge shall esteem them heroes and yield to them the spoils of war .

		To change the metaphor : Impressionism ,
Pleinair	PERSON	- isme and Pointillisme have opened the gates to inca - pacity and chicanery .

		Again , speaking of the most recent apostles of modernism , against whose `` shameless rub - bish '' `` it is an astounding thing that , with one or two exceptions , no critics can be found who will frankly and fearlessly set their faces , '' Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	says : Our present revolutionaries have won no support at all amongst painters .

		Their popularity has been a thing of newspaper `` booming . ''

		It has had no real life because people have been able to see nothing in it .

		Works which , upon patient examination , yield more and more conviction , are those which possess true and good principles .

		It is ridiculous to suppose that men who have made a life-long study of painting , who have lived always in the atmosphere or art and are alive and keen to every sign of new life , can be so much surpassed in perspicuity by a few untrained men as to miss in their works any sign of true life and progress if such is there to be seen .

		It is likewise ridiculous to sup - pose that childish and hideous performances can possess truths and beauties which the foremost artists can not see , but which two or three dealers and news - paper critics can recognize by intuition or revelation .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 423 Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	insists also on the partnership of the people in art .

		The public , whose ideal of beauty has always had a generous share , along with the genius of the artist , in the production of art expression , is not to be despised and scorned .

		There is health in the demand of the public for a transcript of life , in its dis - trust and disgust at the substitution of strangeness and unreality for the traditional language of art .

		With due regard for the fact that the artist must necessarily be in advance of the public , it is a safe principle that the art which troubles the public is by that very fact rendered suspect .

		`` Nothing but man 's un - troubled joy in art can keep art alive . ''

		THE GROWTH OF REPUTATION .

		* The late Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, whose death at the age of seventy-seven occurred a little more than a year ago , had won a wide reputation as a careful and sound productive scholar .

		His monographs on
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	,
Chaucer	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his writings on the English language , although some of them expressed views to which his critics could by no means assent , were respected as valuable contributions to knowledge ; and taken alto - gether , his career as a public teacher and man of letters was honorable and distinguished .

		In his later years , Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	became interested in the history of critical opinion with respect to
Browning	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son .

		His lectures on
Browning	PERSON	's early works , published in
1911	DATE	, were reviewed in THE DIAL for
Feb. 1 , 1912	DATE	.

		His far more elaborate work on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	, which bade fair to rival in bulk his three-volume `` Studies in Chaucer , '' was cut short by his lamented death .

		Although he never expected to cover the poet 's entire career , he hoped to come down to the publication of `` The Idylls of the King . ''

		When death overtook him , though he had collected much material for the decade of the fifties , he had not fully completed his remarks on `` In Memoriam , '' and none of the chapters had received his final revision .

		This fact must be borne in mind in judging the volume before us , which has been very ably edited and seen through the press by Professor Cross .

		It is a well printed book of nearly seven hundred pages .

		So well have the editor and his associates done their work that only rarely is one reminded that the book is to be taken not as a finished product but as a torso .

1809	DATE	to 1860 -RRB- .

		By
Thomas R. Lounsbary	PERSON	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		On nearly every page one finds specimens of that pungent and thoroughly characteristic humor for which the author was celebrated .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	has expressed himself frankly and colloquially , and has not aimed at preserving an atmosphere of academic frigidity .

		As a result , he has certainly pro- duced a most readable book , on what might have been deemed a rather dry subject .

		The task which he set himself was to write a literary biography of Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	which should not supplant but rather supplement existing biographical works , chief among which , of course , is the memoir by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's son .

		Specifically , he sought to trace the growth of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's popularity and the change of attitude toward him on the part of his critics .

		From the narrative several facts become clear .

		The first to be noted is that although
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's friends worked hard at the outset of his career to bring him to the favorable notice of the public , their efforts had no appreciable effect upon his permanent reputation , which his works have earned on their own merits .

		Another is that
Tennyson	PERSON	's own morbid hypersensitiveness to hostile criticism was one of his worst enemies , but for the existence of which he might have jumped ten years earlier to the position of
England	LOCATION	's chief poet .

		Not only did unfavorable comment so depress him that at times he thought of writing no more , but it induced him to commit at least two indiscretions , the lines to
Christopher North	PERSON	and `` The New Timon and the Poets . ''

		The former , if
Lounsbury	PERSON	's reasoning is correct , recoiled on his head in the malicious review in `` The Quarterly '' for
April , 1833	DATE	, which was probably written by
Lockhart	PERSON	at the insti - gation of
Wilson	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , while eager for praise and somewhat too easily upset by blame ,
Tennyson	PERSON	, in revising his poetry , was singu - larly independent of criticism , especially of censure .

		Indeed , he did not sufficiently , per - haps , respect what might be called the vested rights of the public ; for he sometimes intro - duced sweeping changes into a poem after his readers had become thoroughly familiar with and fond of its first form .

		Some of these changes may have been desirable ; others , it would seem , were not .

		Again , the steady stream of unfavorable criticism which greeted the volumes of
1830	DATE	and
1833	DATE	, and which continued through almost two decades , seems to have had no permanent effect upon
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's reputation .

		This was regulated not by the critics but by the public , which paid little attention to the critical jour - nals .

		By
1850	DATE	,
Tennyson	PERSON	had become one of 424 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	the leading poets , if not the first poet , of
England	LOCATION	; and this triumph both
Wilson	PERSON	and
Lockhart	PERSON	lived to see .

		It has been generally supposed that
Hallam	PERSON	's death in
1833	DATE	paralyzed
Tennyson	LOCATION	's poetical activity for some years .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	finds the case to be otherwise .

		The event did , to be sure , have a disastrous effect upon the poet 's health ; but when that im - proved , he wrote as much as ever .

		Indeed , we may suppose from various remarks in the earlier parts of `` In Memoriam '' that in writ - ing he found an anodyne .

		A general conclusion to be drawn from
Tennyson	LOCATION	's life is that contemporary criticism of works of the imagination is generally futile .

		There is of course the personal equation which leads one man to look with indifference upon what the vast majority of men passionately admire .

		But far greater than this is the difficulty that attends hi who is compelled to give speedily a fair and just judgment of a work which necessarily requires for honest appreciation that thorough familiarity which is begot of frequent examination and of examination in different states of mind .

		This is true of every single poem of any length .

		But when it comes to a collection of short poems , the task of judging be - comes infinitely harder .

		Of the scores of reviews of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's early works , very few are worth reading to-day , because few critics were able to detach them - selves from preconceived notions sufficiently to set a proper value upon this new worker in poetry .

		Much , too , of the early criticism was mere parrot talk learned from bolder writers .

		The fourth chapter gives us a useful history of the critical journalism of the period .

		The two great reviews , '' The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' and `` The Quarterly , '' were `` mighty powers both in the world of literature and of politics . ''

		In
1832	DATE	, an article in `` The Quarterly '' is said to have sent stocks down two per cent .

		In literature they made or ruined reputations .

		Gradually , however , their influence was diminished in consequence of the appearance of the month - lies and the weeklies , of which by
1830	DATE	several had sprung up .

		In all of these , moreover , the style of criticism was far more vociferous and brutal than would be tolerated to-day .

		It was a time when
Lockhart	PERSON	in `` Blackwood 's '' could speak of `` the calm , settled , impertur - bable , drivelling idiocy of ` Endymion / '' and when the anonymous reviewer -LRB- probably
Christopher North	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Hunt 's `` Byron '' could speak of it -LRB-
March , 1828	DATE	-RRB- as `` hypocritical twaddle , '' and of its author as a
Freizeland Bantam	LOCATION	, `` the vainest bird that attempts to crow '' `` who to the prating pertness of the parrot , the chattering impudence of the mag - pie , to say nothing of the mowing malice of the monkey adds the hissiness of the bill - pointing gander and the gobble-bluster of the bubbly-jock , '' etc. .

		Just why this sort of thing was supposed to be more effective than sober argument is not clear .

		Nowadays if critics believe all this of an author , they do not write forty-five-page reviews on him , but pass him over in silence .

		Interesting , too , is the chapter on `` Surviv - ing Reputations of the Georgian Era . ''

		In
1830	DATE	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	was still highly regarded , although his best work had long since been done .

		Circumstances had combined to give
Byron	PERSON	an immense reputation , and he `` was still the one whom nearly every youthful aspirant for poetic honors took consciously or unconsciously as his model . ''

		Curiously enough ,
Shelley	PERSON	's reputation was just begin - ning .

		Still later did
Keats	PERSON	come to his own .

		It will thus be observed that the growth of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's reputation was synchronous with the growth of
Keats	PERSON	's fame a fact that is interesting in view of the affinity between the two poets .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	has thrown much light on the obscurer years of
Tennyson	PERSON	's career , and his book therefore deserves the careful perusal of all students of the Poet Laureate .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It may have been feared from early signs that we were to have a very searching time with the novels this year .

		It made the older ones among us look back with sombre recol - lection to the days when the name `` problem novel '' was invented .

		The novelists appeared to be delving in great depths of thought .

		Life , whether real or not , was very earnest .

		Especially did it seem necessary to consider why it should be that two people who had promised to love each other till death did part , should find themselves unable to do so , or else what it was best to do when this was the case .

		Such matters were much in mind ; and as they had often been in mind before , a gloom of conventionality and even tedious - ness seemed to be settling down .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 425 `` The Blind Man 's Eyes '' has all these ele - ments , at least it has mystery ; and when life is mysterious , it is likely also to have adventure and romance .

		I have read no bet - ter detective story for a good while .

		It is difficult to write about such a book , because it is a shame to give an idea of the story beforehand .

		Of course there are those who think it best to read the end of such a story first , so as to appreciate better the art by which one 's interest and curiosity are height - ened and carried along .

		I have no doubt that this is a good practice , but it surely ought to be a matter of choice .

		It is not fair to insist on telling such things beforehand .

		One thing , however , may be told .

		This story is of a blind man who knew much more than many who could see .

		This seems to me a novel and ingen - ious idea , even if it does not reach the dignity of a `` new note . ''

		This would be a good place to say some - thing of the history of the detective story , if only I knew enough .

		It is very easy to say , '' ` The Blind Man 's Eyes ' sounds a new note , '' or something of the sort , but one needs con - siderable knowledge of literary history to determine whether a `` note '' really is new or not .

		I am sadly ignorant of the history of the detective story , and how far it used to be considered literary , and whether it used to be such as could be read with a preservation of intellectual self-respect .

		I remember that in the old pre-Sherlock-Holmes days , most of the detective stories -LRB- not counting the dime novel predecessors of `` Old Sleuth , '' if there were any -RRB- were French :
Gaboriau	PERSON	was the chief man at it who is now remembered , though there were others .

		But they were not very respectable from the literary standpoint .


Andrew Lang	PERSON	wrote -LRB- in a Ballade of the day -RRB- : These two have shortened many a mile Miss
Braddon	PERSON	and
Gaboriau	PERSON	.

		There were of course exceptions .


Wilkie Collins	PERSON	and
Charles Beade	PERSON	, as well as the delightful
Miss Braddon	PERSON	, provided mystery , though not always the mysteries of detection .

		It was Mr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	-LRB- as he was then -RRB- who was the
Joshua	PERSON	, if not absolutely the
Moses	PERSON	, of a new and promising land .

		The idea that detection of crime was no esoteric cult , but that it was open to all who could detect , was wholly in keeping with the democratic tendencies of our time .

		The idea that such personal detection was likely to be better than the rigid rule-of-thumb officialism was also natural to an age which prefers the spirit to the letter as does our easy-going , luxurious time .

		The idea that crime was to be detected by thinking about it in a logical manner , in - stead of listening conveniently at doors or sliding panels or wearing false whiskers and other disguises , was in keeping with the sin - cerity of modern realism .

		These important points had been clearly seen by
Poe	PERSON	, but they were popularized by the creator of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	with such real literary art that since that time the detective story has been a rec - ognized form of higher literature .

		And people have been delighted to find that it was just as literary to follow absorbedly the way a clever burglar uses a red-haired man to get into a bank , only to be headed off by a cocaine - user sitting at a concert , as it was to be dis - turbed about whether one had a right or a duty to commit suicide , or to leave one 's hus - band and children .

		All this is perhaps a little too academic .

		The intellectualist as a detector of crime is , of course , not a new figure , but it was certainly ingenious to think of a blind intellectualist who knew so much more than any one else .

		Then as to the murder .

		I have always a preju - dice against a murder , it seems as though there could not possibly be so many mysteri - ous murders ; it was certainly not the least of the gifts of
Conan Doyle	PERSON	to think of so many things worth detection beside murders .

		But granted a murder , it was certainly a good thing , in this case , for the murdered man to come to himself and find out about the crime better than anybody else .

		So Messrs.
Mac	PERSON	-
Harg	PERSON	and
Balmer	PERSON	are well started , and once started they are quite equal to their oppor - tunity .

		They do not have , as some detective - story writers have had , a keen sense of character ; but there are not many detective stories that really do give us much sense of reality in persons , now and then one gets it , but not often when there are the other necessary things , `` The Blind Man 's Eyes '' carries its story along with unfailing ingenu - ity and resource .

		Mr.
Maurice Drake	PERSON	is already known by other books which I have not read .

		`` The Ocean Sleuth '' is a good detective story with an additional dash of the sea .

		Indeed , I sup - pose that the sea-story part is more interest - ing to Mr.
Drake	PERSON	than the rest ; there is more gusto in the opening chapters about the wrecking-tug , more vigor in the scene at the wreck of the liner , than I find afterward .

		Fortunately , Mr.
Drake	PERSON	takes his time ; and though he is bent on detection , he likes quite as well to tell of one thing or another as to get on with his story .

		I am sure he has plenty of excellent touches that I have missed in my haste to find out about the bank notes , like
Austin	LOCATION	's opinion of
Anjou Mousseaux	LOCATION	before and after having seen the young lady he had come to
Brest	LOCATION	to see .

		This disposition 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	to dally with his subject is a good thing ; a whole novel at the intensity of a good detective story is a hard thing to read .


Conan Doyle	PERSON	's long stories do not come up to the shorter ones .

		Mr.
Drake	PERSON	was probably cut out for something other than a writer of stories of mystery .

		Not that his mystery is not good -LRB- it is not a murder , which at least shows a step toward originality -RRB- , but better are his glimpses of the sea and of the men who sail upon it or knock about its shores .

		When Mr.
Voogdt	PERSON	takes a pint of beer with uncle or tries to make a point out of
Peters of Millbay Docks	ORGANIZATION	, or cor - responds with
Aaron Fletcher	PERSON	of S. S. `` Godwit , '' I felt rather more at home than when he is going around
Brest	LOCATION	looking for hundred franc notes .

		Everybody will not like that sort of thing better , but it has more of the touch of life to it .

		One can not say even now that everyone can write a good detective story ; it is unfortunately true not only that many can not but that of their number some try .

		But it is also true that fewer still can write a story with a touch of real life to it , and that is a thing which somehow seems better worth doing than the other .

		So one may rather hope that Mr.
Maurice Drake	PERSON	will keep his mind fixed more on the ocean and less on the sleuth .

		He will be likely to write other interesting books on what he happens to be thinking about ; but a story will prob - ably grow out of his experiences with the men of the sea quite as easily as it can be thought out from a good situation , whether of bank notes or something else .

		One is always pretty safe with Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	.

		It is true that people generally say of each new book that of course it is not as good as `` A Maker of History '' or whichever of his former novels they read first in that golden long ago when they first made his acquaintance .

		But they are generally indulgent , too , and before they come to an end they are likely to be consoled for their disappointment .

		In `` An Amiable Charla - tan , '' Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	lets his readers down easily .

		He plays with them , it must be ad - mitted ; I think he is more of an amiable charlatan himself than Mr.
Bundercombe	PERSON	was .

		Mr.
Bundercombe	PERSON	was amiable enough , but he was not the kind of person whom I think of as a charlatan .

		Even in his preliminary form , he is not that .

		But charlatan or not , he moves in the real
Oppenheim	PERSON	world , that strange if delightful world in which one spends most of one 's time at restaurants , sometimes with a glass of hock by one 's side and a portion of the plat du jour before one , and sometimes with a more elaborate menu , but always in a mood for something to happen .

		Those won - derful restaurants , not of the
Hotel Milan	LOCATION	this time , but
Stephano	PERSON	's !

		What a change from stiff English country-houses , or stiff American houses in town , from our highly moral amusements and our dull day-by-day life !

		Such -LRB- at least -RRB- was the view of that charming adventuress so devoted to her amiable if criminal father ; and while we are with Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	we can understand how Mr.
Walmsley	PERSON	felt about her , even after he had once or twice gone to
Scotland	LOCATION	Yard with her .

		But Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	is really too respec - table ; he feels too responsible for our morals .

		It is suggested that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	allowed Mer - cutio to perish in the middle of the play because he felt unequal to carrying him through to the end .

		I have no such lack of confidence in Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	, but I unhesi - tatingly pronounce the first part of the book the best .

		But this sort of talking of course gives little idea to those who have not read the book , and is not of interest to those who have .

		Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	really needs no com - ment , but only to be passed along .

		After so much that is exciting everybody will want a change .

		Even the intellectual and artistic Greeks after a trilogy of tragedies liked a change , and used to have satyric plays , of which all have been lost .

		These consisted , doubtless , of a crude , probably a coarse , humor , which would only have been enjoyable after a long day devoted to Prometheus ,
Medea	LOCATION	, or -LRB- Edipus .

		After a trilogy of detec - tive stories -LRB- even ending with Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim -RRB- one should have a change .

		The best thing would be something rather realistic , something that would give one the feeling of real , if unexciting , life ; but failing such for the moment , one will do well to read Mr.
Tark	PERSON	- ington 's `` Seventeen . ''

		To be perfectly frank about this book , I should say that it was the most dreadful combination I had met with in years , but very funny .

		Probably not even Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	would expect that I should appreciate it : I am too like Mr.
Parcher	PERSON	for that , though older even than he was .

		I rec - ognize truth in Mr.
Parcher	PERSON	, except that I do not believe that he -LRB- or any other gentleman of or from
Indiana	LOCATION	-RRB- ever retired on a hot
summer	DATE	's evening to read `` Plutarch 's Lives '' in the library , even to escape a young man of seventeen on the piazza talking with a lovely girl who used baby talk .

		But Mr.
Parcher	PERSON	had arrived at an age when he did not appre - ciate youth .

		`` Fathers forget , '' says Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	, and this is certainly true of some things , though not always of others , as for instance jokes .

		`` Seventeen '' is a remarkable piece of work .

		That a man should be able to take the elements of boy and girl , little sister ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 427 the collar-button , the youthful poem , the slight moustache , make a book from them and offer it for sale and yet not only be allowed to live but be encouraged seems beyond belief .

		It can not be doubted that `` Seventeen '' has stirred thousands to inordinate and healthful laughter .

		Some will not laugh so much as others , but even these will read the book through if only to find out whether there is to be a goat eating tomato-cans , and whether Mr.
Parcher	PERSON	is to put up a stove .

		Every age has its own standards , especially in humor : a generation ago ``
Helen	PERSON	's Babies '' was de - lightful ; before that , `` Tom
Sawyer	PERSON	. ''

		The youth of the present do not care for ``
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	, '' and never heard of ``
Helen	PERSON	's
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- bies . ''

		No one who would understand the twentieth century should omit Mr.
Tarking	PERSON	- ton 's study of current adolescence .

		It will do much to explain the history of our country thirty years hence , if we can stick it out 80 lon S -

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		`` Many things I have wrote to ^ t money , '' said
Robert Greene	PERSON	on his death-bed .

		His works fill thirteen volumes in
Grosart	LOCATION	's admirable edi - tion .

		He was the most prolific of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan writers , his output including romances , framework tales , social pamphlets , prodigal son stories , poems , plays , '' repentances '' ; and he was versatile as well as prolific .

		His lit - erary work was done in twelve years , and he died at thirty-four .


Greene	PERSON	's allusion to the '' upstart crow .

		.

		in his owne conceit the onely Shake scene in a countrie '' has done more to keep his name alive than all the other relics of his pen ; yet
Robert Greene	PERSON	's `` many things '' have more than passing interest for the student of his age .

		An interesting study of
Robert Greene	PERSON	is to be found in the mono - graph by Dr.
John Clark Jordan	PERSON	, lately issued by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is con - scientious and readable .

		The romances -LRB- in - cluding the tales -RRB- , the social pamphlets , and the `` repentances '' are analyzed and studied in detail .

		In the first of these groups , Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	finds
Greene	PERSON	following , with not a few borrowings , the taste and the models of the hour .

		In the second group , also with occa - sional appropriation of other men 's wares , he was working in a field somewhat less occupied and one obviously attractive to him .

		As to
Greene	PERSON	's humanitarian purpose in the conny - catching pamphlets , Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	does not think that we should claim much ;
Greene	PERSON	was quite as interested in the production of what would sell as of what would edify .

		The two aims may have happened sometimes to coin - cide .

		In his discussion of the '' repentances , '' also , the author of the thesis is skeptical .

		The earlier pamphlets he considers not autobio - graphical but commercial fiction .

		However , while autobiographical inferences must be de - rived with caution , there is no need of going to the other extreme and denying any reflec - tion of actual experience .

		Of
Greene	PERSON	's poetry his critic says pithily , that it is best appre - ciated when it is '' recollected in tranquility . ''

		Chronologies are included in the text , along with a tabulation of the framework tales , a discussion of misconceptions concerning
Greene	PERSON	, and a collection of early allusions to the romancer and dramatist .

		Historical record * of early
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Until recent years investigators interested in the early history of the western
United States	LOCATION	, and especially that of
Illinois	LOCATION	, have concerned themselves with either the period of the French influence or that following
Clark	PERSON	's
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	expedition .

		The intervening period -1763 to
1778	DATE	has been touched only i lightly , the attention paid it being by no means equal to that which its importance merits .

		During these years the English bus - ied themselves with such problems of colonial organization as confronted them in the west - ern country .

		Most of these were entirely new : the control of the Indians who were as hostile to the English as they were favorable I to the French , the organization of the fur trade , the schemes for colonizing the new country , and finally the organization of a civil government to take the place of the military government .

		The documents which tell this story are scattered in a score of places .

		Some are in print ; others are still in - manuscript form .

		For several years the work I of collecting and editing this material has been going on under the direction of Mr.
Clarence W. Alvord	PERSON	, assisted by Mr.
Clarence E. Carter	PERSON	.

		The results of their labors are to be gathered into five or six volumes known as the `` British Series '' of the `` Illinois His - torical Collections , '' published by the Trus - tees of the
Illinois State Historical Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume Volume X of the '' Collec - tions '' has appeared under the title , '' The Critical Period , '' and deals with the years
1763	DATE	to
1765	DATE	inclusive .

		An introduction by the editor gives a summary of the history of these years .

		Five hundred pages of documents form the body of the substantial volume .

		Such chapter headings as `` Organization of the Western Territory , '' '' The Proposed Col - 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	ony of Charlotina , '' `` Accounts from the
Illi	PERSON	- nois , '' '' The Regulation of Indian Affairs , '' etc. , show the scope of the work .

		If the re - maining volumes approach the standard set by the first there will be no doubt as to the value of the contribution made .

		Since the
Illinois	LOCATION	country was one of the chief centres of activity in the West , the problems which confronted the British imperialists here were those of the whole region .

		For this reason these documents , although they deal primarily with the British in
Illinois	LOCATION	, will be of the greatest assistance to the student who seeks information concerning the plans of the En - glish statesmen for the organization of the empire which they had won from the French .

		In Volume XII of the `` Collections , '' Mr.
Theodore C. Pease	PERSON	gives a compilation of the county records still in existence in the several counties of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		As to the value of these records as historical material , he says that the writer of
Illinois	LOCATION	history who wishes to do work worth while `` must explain how on the foundation of a French empire in the
Missis	LOCATION	- sippi valley has been built an Anglo-Saxon commonwealth how men entered the wilder - ness , bought and sold land , dabbled with the slavery they had put from them in their con - stitution as a forbidden thing , acquired wealth and achieved comfort and luxury , built roads and established schools , and administered a rude justice and a simple gov - ernment .

		In the land records , county com - missioners ' records , and circuit court records , in assessors ' books , the probate wills and in - ventories , the election returns , and the slavery papers that survive in county courthouses is the extant material for such a history of Illi - nois . ''

		Over eight hundred printed pages tell in detail the nature of the records and their location , and at the same time testify to the industry of the compiler of the volume .

		Exercises in nimble - wittedness .

		Fertile fancy , nimbleness of wit , freaks and whims , with an en - gaging manner delightfully free from conventions and defiant of the charge of egoism in its free use of the first person singular of the pronoun , abound in the collec - tion of short pieces more or less concerned with `` The Romance of the Commonplace '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- , and owing their existence to Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	.

		Not new to print , or not all of them new , they are none the less good reading , particularly where they verge , as they often do , on the autobiographical ; for on no subject is anyone so well qualified to write as on his own experiences , material and spiritual .

		`` I keep no pets , '' says Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	, `` since these would enforce my keeping regu - lar hours ; the only familiars I have , there - fore , are my clock , my fire and my candles , and how companionable these may become one does not know who does not live alone . ''

		Even living alone , then , has its romance , whatever the mountain shepherd may say to the con - trary .

		Fifty short papers , collectively dedi - cated to the author 's sisters , `` with whom this philosophy was proven , '' make up the book .

		A birfseye Babylon through centuries of view of time was little more than an abstraction .

		But the persistent and systematic labors of excavators during the last twenty-five years have made it an astounding reality .

		Mr.
Leonard W. King	PERSON	of the British Museum , whose `` History of Sumer and Akkad '' appeared a few years ago , now takes up the story in his `` History of Babylon '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- where the previous work dropped it , namely , where the city of Babylon was on the point of securing permanent leadership under the
West-Semitic Kings	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author carries us through the entire stretch of history from
2225	DATE	B.C. down to the Persian conquest in the sixth century
B.C.	LOCATION	.

		The ten chapters of the volume are rather uneven in value and method of treatment , and , in fact , scarcely accord with the usual canons of history-writing .

		Chapter I states the place of Babylon in the history of antiquity ; chapter II recites in great detail the results of German excavations on the site of old Babylon for the
last two decades	DATE	.

		Chapter III is a rather intricate chronological discussion that should have been relegated to an appendix , and its conclusions incorporated in the body of the volume .

		The remaining chapters present without much variation the regular course of events .

		Chapter V is espe - cially fresh in its discussion of the character - istics and influence of the Hammurabi period , while chapter
VII	ORGANIZATION	embodies results of the wonderful `` finds '' at Boghaz-Keui in
Asia	LOCATION	Minor .

		The appendices are especially valuable in that they give us the latest lists of kings of the dynasties of Nisin ,
Larsa	LOCATION	, and
Babylon	LOCATION	.

		The volume is profusely illustrated .

		The history of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	life at recently reviewed in these col - f .

		ty umns is delightfully supple - mented in its earlier chapters by two small volumes , privately printed as part of last autumn 's fiftieth anniversary celebra - tion and now put upon the market by the
Vassar College Bureau of Publication	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Golden Age of Vassar , '' by
Mary Harriott	PERSON	1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 429
Norris	PERSON	, is the more interesting if the less lively of the two books , for its connected account of the starting of Mr.
Vassar	PERSON	's `` dan - gerous experiment toward unsexing women '' fills in many of the gaps which the `` Letters from Old-Time Vassar '' letters of a student in 1869-70 necessarily leave open .

		Both authors emphasize the enthusiasms of the early days and minimize their hardships and disappointments , or perhaps it would be fairer to say that both turn hardships into glories .

		The opposition of `` Antis '' only strengthened the minds of the feminists of those days , an eternal truth which might be equally well illustrated from to-day 's suffrage campaigns .

		The criticisms brought against the curricu - lum and life of the pioneer institution only made more alert the attitude of its members toward it and toward their own purposes in supporting it .

		The amount of endowment , which , while considered wildly extravagant for its time , was in reality extremely inade - quate to meet all needs , stimulated greater proportional efforts to increase its total sum than those which at this moment are being put forth to raise the immediately needed million dollar fund .

		Finally , the simple life of the students , with its `` mush and milk '' and its `` hash and vinegar '' meals , left the young women merry and unconventional , youthful Stoics who learned willingly to sub - ordinate luxury and even comfort to spiritual necessity .

		More books such as these are needed in our libraries to vivify with personal recollection the annals that , read abstractly , tend to give a dreary and bare outline to a !

		movement actually full of life and color .

		The story of '' Fr th ^ Bubble '' -LRB- Long - * restless mans -RRB- , by Mr.
Maurice A. Har	PERSON	- bord .

		certainly makes no pre - tension in its title to any great seriousness of style , and in fact its entertaining contents are largely anecdotal ; but the anecdotes are of personal experience , and their abundance and variety are astonishing .

		In quest of change and adventure the author has apparently been roaming the two hemispheres from the age of sixteen to his present maturity , whatever that may be , and only pauses long enough to write what he calls the first volume of his life because of temporary disablement in an encounter with an African leopard .

		From clerking in a bank to ranch life in
Montana	LOCATION	, thence to campaigning in
South Africa	LOCATION	in the Boer `` War , after that to service in the Trans - vaal Town Police , then to farming in
Nyanza Province	LOCATION	these are some of the many bewil - dering moves that the reader of the book follows as best he may .

		The author was at Ladysmith during the siege , and took part in the relief of Maf eking ; and everywhere he saw , heard about , or was a participant in occurrences worth relating .

		Little of his more intimate family history is recorded , but he describes himself as `` the thirteenth child of a family of fifteen '' and `` raised in the ortho - dox English way . ''

		His father , a clergyman , shipped him off at a rather early age to
Sibley	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, and there the eventful narrative really begins .

		It is brisk reading , and furthermore is well illustrated .

		method , f the making of books on in teaching English composition there is no end .

		Still an occasional volume stands out from the mass and justifies itself .

		`` How the French Boy Learns to Write '' -LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives `` good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over . ''

		Professor
R. W. Brown	PERSON	of
Wabash College	ORGANIZATION	, starting from the fairly well established fact that the average Frenchman writes the mother tongue with greater accuracy and even distinction than does the average American , went to
France	LOCATION	in
1912	DATE	and devoted the academic year to a study of the methods used in the French schools , par - ticularly in the primary and secondary courses .

		He found abundant evidence that the French boy of high school age writes better than the American boy , that he has a more highly developed skill in the use of words , and a better sense for literature .

		The reasons assigned have the merit of appearing more than adequate to the result .

		The im - portant ones are these : The unifying effort of the
National Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	; the universal methods of dictation and con - scious study of vocabulary ; the superiority of the teachers , due to their training , their hon - orable social position , their secure future , and their leisure for personal growth ; and greatest of all , the national tradition that language , i. e. , the mother tongue , is the most important thing for a French boy to know .

		The author scores the vagaries in American school methods , and remarks trenchantly that we `` have a national habit of taking up a subject or idea , proving its absolute importance , and then immediately forgetting all about it . ''

		This may be a prophetic foreboding of the reception of his own book of suggestions .

		Individual teachers here and there will profit by it ; but there is small chance in our individualistic riot of its accomplishing any fundamental reform .

		whether anyone but an atheist could believe in the infinitely small .

		Now , in the early days of another startling develop - ment in mathematics , at least one mathemati - cian assures us that the '' new infinite '' has a vital message for the `` old theology , '' and is apparently questioning whether anyone can believe in the infinitely large without being a theist .

		And just as in the beginnings of Hypergeometry spiritualists fancied that they discovered in the new science a gateway to the supra-rational , so to-day a leading idealistic philosopher is convinced that the mathemat - ical infinites are quintessentially related to the life of the Absolute .

		But the history of mathematics is neutral .

		The Calculus and Hypergeometry progressed irrespective of theist , atheist , or mystic ; and the theory of Transfinites is advancing regardless of theol - ogy or metaphysics .

		This new branch of mathematics the arithmetic of infinities of distinct and infinite numbers was invented and developed by
Georg Cantor	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
Halle	LOCATION	.

		Two of his most important memoirs , entitled '' Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of
Transfinite Num	ORGANIZATION	- bers , '' have been translated into English , and supplemented by an excellent historical resume , by Mr.
P. E. B. Jourdain	PERSON	.

		The trans - lation constitutes the initial volume of '' The Open Court Series of Classics of Science and Philosophy , '' and sets for the series an unusu - ally high standard .

		Little essays for the millions .

		Seven years ago Dr.
Frank Crane	PERSON	relinquished the pulpit for the pen .

		Though discharg - ing to general satisfaction the duties of pastor of a prosperous church , he decided to resign his pastorate and risk a hazard of new for - tunes .

		`` My position was too secure , '' he tells us .

		`` It was not precarious enough . ''

		Ap - proaching the half - century mark , he desired `` to keep young '' through the stimulus of a little risk and uncertainty as to where the daily bread was to come from .

		Therefore he became a writer of sermonettes or brief essays for the newspapers , hoping thus to reach a larger public than from the pulpit .

		His ven - ture has proved a success , and hundreds of thousands of newspaper readers have wel - comed his syndicated talks on familiar topics .

		A volume of short essays of this nature now comes from his pen , under the title , `` Adven - tures in Common Se ` nse '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , each essay being only two or three pages in length , and the style admirably adapted to the theme and the intended class of readers .

		The paragraphs are of the briefest , and the whole appearance of the book appeals to the casual and hurried reader .

		A cheerful philosophy of life , a belief in ideals , and a command of terse and forceful language , agreeably tinctured with humor and enlivened with wit these are conspicuous among the book 's qualities .

		`` Readings on the
Relation of Government	ORGANIZATION	to Property and Industry '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Pro- fessor
Samuel P. Orth	PERSON	, is a volume excellently adapted to the needs of business men , classes in business colleges , and college classes in general .

		The material is definitely and compactly organized under the following subjects : the changing con - ceptions of property obligations and of govern - mental functions ; the expanding police power , as sanctioned by state and federal courts ; the control of corporations ; and the development of labor laws .

		The Country Life movement has gained no little headway in the last few years .

		Rural interests and all the instrumentalities for their promotion are intelligently and clearly discussed .

		The church , the school , the library , the part to be played by rural cooperative activities of all sorts , the call to leadership in rural upbuilding , the place of recrea - tions and amusements in the rural community these and other related topics are handled with vigor and understanding .

		Expertness in the use of reference-books is an accomplishment that has increased in value with the decreasing possibility of holding in one 's head the sum total of human knowledge ; and this expert - ness will continue to gain in esteem with the rapid future extension of research in all directions .

Florence M. Hopkins	PERSON	's `` Reference Guides That Should be Known , and How to Use Them , '' pub - lished by the

		Mr.
Edward Salmon	PERSON	will publish immediately a small book entitled '' Shakespeare and Democracy , '' which he hopes will show that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's hu - manity carried him far toward impartiality in all matters affecting the relations of the classes and the mob .

		A new book by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, entitled ``
England	LOCATION	's Effort , '' is announced for
May	DATE	issue by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It deals with various aspects of life in
England	LOCATION	since the war started , and shows how the people at home are cooperating with the men at the front .

		The French ambassador 's new book , `` With Americans of Past and Present Days , '' will contain chapters on
Rochambeau	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, Dr.
Horace H. Furness	PERSON	, and others .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	expect to publish this volume of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's in
May	DATE	.

		The long-announced `` Tennyson Dictionary , '' by Mr.
Arthur E. Baker	PERSON	, whose chief object has been to identify and describe the multitudinous charac - ters , place-names , etc. , both fictitious and historical , created or utilized by the poet , is now promised by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	for next month .

		A collected edition in two volumes of the poems and plays of Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	, with a preface by the author , is announced by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		All published poems to date are included , together with the following plays : `` The
Canterbury Pil	ORGANIZATION	- grims , '' ``
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, '' `` Sappho and Phaon , '' `` The Scarecrow , '' and `` Mater . ''

		`` The Country Life Anthology of Verse , '' edited by Mr.
P. Anderson Graham	PERSON	, is in preparation by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It will contain a collection of poems by modern authors which appeared origi - nally in the English periodical , `` Country Life , '' including verse by
Fiona MacLeod	PERSON	,
W. E. Henley	PERSON	, Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, and many others .

		The next quarterly number of `` The Book Monthly '' will not appear until the beginning of
October	DATE	.

		The paper famine , coming on the top of other war difficulties , has made the way of an English literary magazine especially hard .

		Mr.
James Milne	PERSON	, the editor and proprietor of `` The Book Monthly , '' thinks it best frankly to recognize this and omit his April-May-June and
July	DATE	-
August	DATE	-
September	DATE	numbers .

		Mr.
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	's forthcoming volume of reminiscences will be entitled `` My Days and Dreams : Being Autobiographical Notes . ''

		The notes extend back a quarter of a century , and have been gathered under such headings as `` Per - sonalities , '' `` Trade and Philosophy , '' `` The Story of My Books , '' `` University Extension and North - ern Towns , '' and `` Sheffield and Socialism . ''

		Chap - ters are also included on
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Brighton	LOCATION	experiences .

		Professor
Chester Martin	PERSON	's volume on `` Lord Selkirk 's Work in
Canada	LOCATION	, '' which the
Oxford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press is about to publish in the `` Oxford Historical and Literary Studies , '' is offered as a measure of tardy appreciation of
Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	's services , even though , in the author 's words , `` it may not restore his name to the place which one may hope it would have occupied had his work and life not been cut short by a violent and a not very scrupu - lous opposition . ''

		The story of the Scottish colony which he founded in
Canada	LOCATION	is based on
Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	's own papers .

		One of the features of the forthcoming memoir of
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, in two volumes , by Mr.
James Marchant	PERSON	, is a collection of hitherto unpub - lished letters which , in conjunction with the use of correspondence from
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's autobiography and the lives of
Darwin	PERSON	and
Lyell	PERSON	, tells the story of the evolution of the idea of natural selection in the scientists ' own words .

		The letters also include correspondence with
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	,
Kingsley	PERSON	, Sir
Francis Galton	PERSON	, Sir
Joseph Hooker	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and many other celebrities , covering every aspect of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's manv-sided interests .

		432 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 27	DATE	An `` Introduction to the Study of
International Relations	ORGANIZATION	, '' announced by
Messrs. Macmillan	PERSON	, is a volume of papers by various authors , edited by Mr.
Arthur Greenwood	PERSON	, who has himself con - tributed articles on `` International Relations and the Growth of Freedom , '' and `` International Economic Relations . ''

		The remaining papers com - prise `` War and Peace since
1815	DATE	, '' by Professor
A. J. Grant	PERSON	; `` The Causes of Modern Wars , '' by Mr.

J. D. I. Hughes	PERSON	.

		A cumulation , in one alphabet , of the contents of the annual numbers of the `` Readers ' Guide to Periodical Literature , '' for 1910-14 inclusive , is announced for immediate publication by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		About ninety periodicals are indexed by author and subject , and subject references to one hundred and sixty-seven composite books are included in the same alphabet with the magazine references .

		Magazines added to the `` Readers ' Guide '' since
1910	DATE	have been carried back to the beginning of the five-year period .

		The subject - headings have been thoroughly revised and many sub-headings have been added to f acilitate use of so great an amount of material .

		At such a time as this , it is a wise and noble action of Mr.
T. J. Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	in editing and producing an elaborate Doves Press edition of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poems in the original text .

		In this anthol - ogy , which bears the title `` Auserlesene Lieder ,
Gedichte	LOCATION	, und Balladen :
Ein Strauss	PERSON	, '' the poems selected `` have been arranged in three principal groups , with four interwoven Poems indicative of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's attitude to Life , in such a way as to form ein
Strauss	PERSON	: a nosegay of ' visionary flowers ' hav - ing relation in colour and perfume only to one another and to the nosegay which collectively they compose . ''

		The volume will be printed in red and black , from the
Weimar	LOCATION	edition , and will appear in
July	DATE	.

Sandburg	PERSON	's work compares favorably with the best achievements of the recent successful American poets .

		It is , however , distinguished by its trenchant note of social criticism and by its vision of a better social order .

		These poems show , with a wide variety of theme , the modern metropolis , with its brutality and misery , its splendid achievements and unpardonable failures , its garish - ness and its beauty .

		Though
Chicago	LOCATION	furnishes the main motif , the book has many moods .

		The wistful note of beauty is touched no less frequently than the note of well-justified bitterness and resentment .

		It is a composite , expressing the many-sided city with genuine feeling and undeniable sincerity .

		`` His book is sound , daring , inclusive of many types , and makes a contribution to American literature of emancipating influence , and of permanent importance . ''

		THE NEGRO IN
AMERICAN FICTION	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ever since
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	sneered at
Ameri	LOCATION	- can books a hundred years ago , honest critics have asked themselves if the literature of the
United States	LOCATION	was not really open to the charge of provincialism .

		Within the last year or two the argument has been very much revived ; and an English critic , Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	, writing in `` The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' has pointed out that with our predigested ideas and made-to-order fiction we not only discourage individual genius but make it pos - sible for the multitude to think only such thoughts as have passed through a sieve .

		Our most popular novelists , and sometimes our most respectable writers , see only the sensa - tion that is uppermost for the moment in the mind of the crowd , divorce , graft , tainted meat or money , and they proceed to cut the cloth of their fiction accordingly .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, a `` regular practitioner '' of the novel - ist 's art , in substance admitting the weight of these charges , lays the blame on our crass democracy which utterly refuses to do its own thinking and which is satisfied only with the tinsel and gewgaws and hobbyhorses of litera - ture .

		And no theme has suffered so much from the coarseness of the mob-spirit in litera - ture as that of the Negro .

		As a matter of fact , the Negro in his prob - lems and strivings offers to American writers the greatest opportunity that could possibly be given them to-day .

		It is commonly agreed that only one other large question , that of the relations of capital and labor , is of as much interest to the American public ; and even this great issue fails to possess quite the appeal offered by the Negro from the social stand - point .

		One can only imagine what a
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, detached and philosophical , would have done with such a theme in a novel .

		When we see what actually has been done , how often in the guise of fiction a writer has preached a sermon or shouted a political creed or vented his spleen , we are not exactly proud of the art of novel-writing as it has been developed in the
United States of America	LOCATION	.

		Here was opportunity for tragedy , 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	for comedy , for the subtle portrayal of all the relations of man with his fellow man , for faith and hope and love and sorrow .

		And yet , with the Civil War fifty years in the distance , not one novel or one short story of the first rank has found its inspiration in this great theme .

		Instead of such work we have consistently had traditional tales , political tracts , and lurid melodramas .

		Let us see who have approached the theme , and just what they have done with it , for the present leaving out of account all efforts put forth by Negro writers themselves .

		The names of four exponents of Southern life come at once to mind ,
George W. Cable	PERSON	,
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	,
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, and
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	; and at once , in their out - look and method of work , the first two become separate from the last two .

		Cable and
Harris	PERSON	have looked toward the past , and have embalmed vanished or vanishing types .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	and Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	, with their thought on the present -LRB- though for the most part they portray the recent past -RRB- , have used the novel as a vehicle for political propaganda .

		It was in
1879	DATE	that `` Old Creole Days '' evidenced the advent of a new force in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can literature ; and on the basis of this work , and of `` The Grandissimes '' which followed , Mr. Cable at once took his place as the fore - most portrayer of life in old
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		By birth , by temperament , and by training he was thoroughly fitted for the task to which he set himself .

		His mother was from
New England	LOCATION	, his father of the stock of colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	; and the stern Puritanism of the North was mellowed by the gentler influences of the South .

		Moreover , from his long appren - ticeship in newspaper work in
New Orleans	LOCATION	he had received abundantly the knowledge and training necessary for his work .

		Setting himself to a study of the Negro of the old regime , he made a specialty of the famous and infamous quadroon society of
Louisi	LOCATION	- ana of the third and
fourth decades of the last century	DATE	.

		And excellent as was his work , turning his face to the past in manner as well as in matter , from the very first he raised the question propounded by this paper .

		In his earliest volume there was a story entitled '' ` Tite
Poulette	PERSON	, '' the heroine of which was a girl amazingly fair , the supposed daughter of one
Madame John	ORGANIZATION	.

		A young Dutchman fell in love with ` Tite
Poulette	PERSON	, championed her cause at all times , suffered a beating and stab - bing for her , and was by her nursed back to life and love .

		In the midst of his perplexity about joining himself to a member of another race , came the word from
Madame John	ORGANIZATION	that the girl was not her daughter , but the child of yellow fever patients whom she had nursed until they died , leaving their infant in her care .

		Immediately upon the publication of this story , the author received a letter from a young woman who had actually lived in very much the same situation as that portrayed in '' ` Tite Poulette , '' telling him that his story was not true to life and that he knew it was not , for
Madame John	ORGANIZATION	really was the mother of the heroine .

		Accepting the criticism , Mr.
Cable	PERSON	set about the composition of `` Madame Delphine , '' in which the situation is somewhat similar , but in which at the end the mother tamely makes a confession to a priest .

		What is the trouble ?

		The artist is so bound by circumstance and hemmed in by tradition that he simply has not the courage to launch out into the deep and work out his human problems for himself .

		Take a repre - sentative portrait from `` The Grandissimes '' :
Clemence	PERSON	had come through ages of African savagery , through fires that do not refine , but that blunt and blast and blacken and char ; starvation , gluttony , drunkenness , thirst , drowning , nakedness , dirt , fetichism , debauchery , slaughter , pestilence , and the rest she was their heiress ; they left her the cinders of human feelings ... She had had children of assorted colors had one with her now , the black boy that brought the basil to
Joseph	PERSON	; the others were here and there , some in the Grandissime households or field-gangs , some else - where within occasional sight , some dead , some not accounted for .

		Husbands like the Samaritan woman 's .

		We know she was a constant singer and laugher .

		Very brilliant of course ; and yet
Clemence	PERSON	is a relic , not a prophetess .

		Still more of a relic is Uncle Remus .

		For decades now , this charming old Negro has been held up to the children of the South as the perfect expression of the beauty of life in the glorious times `` befo ' de wah , '' when every Southern gentleman was suckled at the bosom of a `` black mammy . ''

		Why should we not occasionally attempt to paint the Negro of the new day intelligent , ambitious , thrifty , manly ?

		Perhaps he is not so poetic ; but certainly the human element is greater .

		To the school of Cable and
Harris	PERSON	belong also of course
Miss Grace King	ORGANIZATION	and Mrs.
Ruth McEnery Stuart	PERSON	, a thoroughly representative piece of work being Mrs.
Stuart	PERSON	's `` Uncle
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 447 ` Riah 's Christmas Eve . ''

		Other more popu - lar writers of the day , Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	and Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	for instance , attempt no special analysis of the Negro .

		They simply take him for granted as an institution that always has existed and always will exist , as a hewer of wood and drawer of water , from the first flush of creation to the sounding of the trump of doom .

		But more serious is the tone when we come to
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page and
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	.

		We might tarry for a few minutes with Mr. Page to listen to more such tales as those of Uncle Remus ; but we must turn to living issues .

		Times have changed .

		The grandson of Uncle Remus does not feel that he must stand with his hat in his hand when he is in our presence , and he even presumes to help us in the running of our government .

		This will never do ; so in `` Red Rock '' and `` The Leopard 's Spots '' it must be shown that he should never have been allowed to vote any - way , and those honorable gentlemen in the

1865	DATE	did not know at all what they were about .

		Though we are given the characters and setting of a novel , the real business is to show that the Negro has been the `` sentimental pet '' of the nation all too long .

		By all means let us have an innocent white girl , a burly Negro , and a burning at the stake , or the story would be incomplete .

		`` We have the same thing in `` The Clans - man , '' a `` drama of fierce revenge . ''

		But here we are concerned very largely with the black - ening of a man 's character .

		Stoneman -LRB- Thad - deus
Stevens	PERSON	very thinly disguised -RRB- is himself the whole
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He is a gambler , and `` spends a part of almost every night at
Hall & Pemberton	ORGANIZATION	's
Faro Place	ORGANIZATION	on
Pennsylvania Avenue	LOCATION	. ''

		He is hys - terical , `` drunk with the joy of a triumphant vengeance . ''

		`` The South is conquered soil , '' he says to the President -LRB- a mere figure-head , by the way -RRB- , `` I mean to blot it from the map . ''

		Further : `` It is but the justice and wisdom of heaven that the Negro shall rule the land of his bondage .

		It is the only solu - tion of the race problem .

		Wait until I put a ballot in the hand of every Negro , and a bayonet at the breast of every white man from the
James	PERSON	to the Rio Grande . ''

		Stoneman , moreover , has a mistress , a mulatto woman , a `` yellow vampire '' who dominates him com - pletely .

		`` Senators , representatives , politi - cians of low and high degree , artists , correspondents , foreign ministers , and cab - inet officers hurried to acknowledge their fealty to the uncrowned king , and hail the strange brown woman who held the keys of his house as the first lady of the land . ''

		This , let us remember , was for some months the best-selling book in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A slightly altered version of it has very recently commanded such prices as were never before paid for seats at a moving picture entertain - ment ; and with `` The Traitor '' and `` The Southerner '' it represents our most popular treatment of the gravest social question in American life !

		`` The Clansman '' is to Amer - ican literature exactly what a
Louisiana	LOCATION	mob is to American democracy .

		Only too fre - quently , of course , the mob represents us all too well .

		Turning from the longer works of fiction to the short story , I have been interested to see how the matter has been dealt with here .

		For purposes of comparison I have selected from ten representative periodicals as many dis - tinct stories , no one of which was published more than ten years ago ; and as these are in almost every case those stories that first strike the eye in a periodical index , we may assume that they are thoroughly typical .

		The ten are : `` Shadow , '' by
Harry Stillwell Edwards	PERSON	, in the `` Century '' -LRB-
December , 1906	DATE	-RRB- ; `` Call - um 's Co ` tin ' : A Plantation Idyl , '' by
Frank H. Sweet	PERSON	, in `` The Craftsman '' -LRB-

L. M. Cooke	PERSON	, in `` Putnam 's '' -LRB-

Harris Merton Lyon	PERSON	, in the `` American '' -LRB-
February , 1910	DATE	-RRB- ; `` Sha - dow , '' by
Grace MacGowan Cooke	ORGANIZATION	and
Alice MacGowan	PERSON	, in `` Everybody 's '' -LRB-
March , 1910	DATE	-RRB- ; ``

Edna Turpin	PERSON	, in the ``

Norman Duncan	PERSON	, in `` Har - per 's '' -LRB-
June	DATE	,
1915	DATE	-RRB- ; and `` The Chalk Game , '' by
L. B. Yates	PERSON	, in `` The
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post '' -LRB-
June 5 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- .

		For high standards of fiction I think we may safely say that , all in all , the periodicals here mentioned are representative of the best that
America	LOCATION	has to offer .

		In some cases the story cited is the only one on the Negro question that a magazine has published within the decade .

		448 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	`` Shadow '' -LRB- in the `` Century '' -RRB- is the story of a Negro convict who for a robbery com - mitted at the age of fourteen was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor in the mines of
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		An accident disabled him , how - ever , and prevented his doing the regular work for the full period of his imprisonment .

		At twenty he was a hostler , looking forward in despair to the fourteen years of confine - ment still waiting for him .

		But the three little girls of the prison commissioner visit the prison .

		Shadow performs many little acts of kindness for them , and their hearts go out to him .

		They storm the governor and the judge for his pardon , and present the Negro with his freedom as a Christmas gift .

		The story is not long , but it strikes a note of genuine pathos .

		`` Callum 's Co ` tin ' '' is concerned with a hard-working Negro , a blacksmith , nearly forty , who goes courting the girl who called at his shop to get a trinket mended for her mistress .

		At first he makes himself ridiculous by his finery ; later he makes the mistake of coming to a crowd of merrymakers in his working clothes .

		More and more , however , he storms the heart of the girl , who eventually capitulates .

		From the standpoint simply of craftsmanship , the story is an excellent piece of work .

		`` His Excellency the Governor '' deals with the custom on Southern plantations of hav - ing , in imitation of the white people , a Negro `` governor '' whose duty it was to settle minor disputes .

		At the death of old Uncle
Caleb	PERSON	, who for years had held this position of responsibility , his son Jubal should have been the next in order .

		He was likely to be super - seded , however , by loud-mouthed Sambo , though urged to assert himself by
Maria	PERSON	, his wife , an old house-servant who had no desire whatever to be defeated for the place of honor among the women by Sue , a former field-hand .

		At the meeting where all was to be decided , however ,
Jubal	PERSON	with the aid of his fiddle completely confounded his rival and won .

		There are some excellent touches in the story ; but , on the whole , the composition is hardly more than fair in literary quality .

		`` The Black Drop , '' throughout which we see the hand of an experienced writer , ana - lyzes the heart of a white boy who is in love with a girl who is almost white , and who when the test confronts him suffers the tradition that binds him to get the better of his heart .

		`` But you will still believe that I love you ? ''

		he asks , ill at ease as they separate .

		`` No , of course I can not believe that , '' replies the girl .

		`` Jungle Blood '' is the story of a simple - minded , simple-hearted Negro of gigantic size who in a moment of fury kills his pretty wife and the white man who has seduced her .

		The tone of the whole may be gleaned from the description of
Moss Harper	PERSON	's father : `` An old darky sat drowsing on the stoop .

		There was something ape-like about his long arms , his flat , wide-nostriled nose , and the mat of gray wool which crept down his forehead to within two inches of his eyebrows . ''

		`` The Race-Rioter '' sets forth the stand of a brave young sheriff to protect his prisoner , a Negro boy , accused of the assault and mur - der of a little white girl .


Hank Egge	PERSON	tries by every possible subterfuge to defeat the plans of a lynching party , and finally dies riddled with bullets as he is defending his prisoner .

		The story is especially remarkable for the strong and sympathetic characteriza - tion of such contrasting figures as young Egge and old
Dikeson	PERSON	, the father of the dead girl .

		`` Shadow '' -LRB- in `` Everybody 's '' -RRB- is a story that depends for its force very largely upon incident .

		It studies the friendship of a white boy ,
Ranny	PERSON	, and a black boy , Shadow , a rela - tionship that is opposed by both the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	white mother and the ambitious and inde - pendent Negro mother .

		In a fight ,
Shad	ORGANIZATION	breaks a collar-bone for Ranny ; later he saves him from drowning .

		In the face of
Ranny	ORGANIZATION	's white friends , all the harsher side of the prob - lem is seen ; and yet the human element is strong beneath it all .

		The story , not without considerable merit as it is , would have been infinitely stronger if the friendship of the two boys had been pitched on a higher plane .

		As it is ,
Shad	ORGANIZATION	is very much like a dog following his master .

		``
Abram	PERSON	's Freedom '' is at the same time one of the most clever and one of the most pro- voking stories with which we have to deal .

		It is a perfect example of how one may walk directly up to the light and then deliberately turn his back upon it .

		The story is set just before the Civil War .

		It deals with the love of the slave
Abram	PERSON	for a free young woman ,
Emmeline	LOCATION	.

		`` All his life he had heard and used the phrase ` free nigger ' as a term of contempt .

		What , then , was this vague feel - ing , not definite enough yet to be a wish or
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 even a longing ? ''

		So far , so good .

		Emmeline inspires within her lover the highest ideals of manhood , and he becomes a hostler in a livery-stable , paying to his master so much a year for his freedom .

		Then comes the astounding and forced conclusion .

		At the very moment when , after years of effort , Emmeline has helped her husband to gain his freedom -LRB- and when all the slaves are free as a matter of fact by virtue of the Emancipa - tion Proclamation -RRB- ,
Emmeline	LOCATION	, whose husband has special reason to be grateful to his former master , says to the lady of the house : `` Me an '
Abram	PERSON	ai n't got nothin ' to do in dis worl ' but to wait on you an ' master . ''

		In `` A Hypothetical Case '' we again see the hand of a master-craftsman .

		Is a white boy justified in shooting a Negro who has offended him ?

		The white father is not quite at ease , quibbles a good deal , but finally says Yes .

		The story , however , makes it clear that the Negro did not strike the boy .

		He was a her - mit living on the
Florida	LOCATION	coast and perfectly abased when he met
Mercer	PERSON	and his two com - panions .

		When the three boys pursued him and finally overtook him , the Negro simply held the hands of Mercer until the boy had recovered his temper .

		Mercer in his rage really struck himself .

		`` The Chalk Game '' is the story of a little Negro jockey who wins a race in
Louisville	LOCATION	only to be drugged and robbed by some `` flashlight '' Negroes who send him to Chi - cago .

		There he recovers his fortunes by giv - ing to a group of gamblers the correct `` tip '' on another race , and he makes his way back to
Louisville	LOCATION	much richer by his visit .

		Through - out the story emphasis is placed upon the superstitious element in the Negro race , an element readily considered by men who believe in luck .

		Of these ten stories , only five strike out with even the slightest degree of independ - ence .

		`` Shadow '' -LRB- in the `` Century '' -RRB- is not a powerful piece of work , but it is written in I tender and beautiful spirit .

		`` The Black | Drop '' is a bold handling of a strong situa - j tion .

		`` The Race-Rioter '' also rings true , and in spite of the tragedy there is optimism in this story of a man who is not afraid to do his duty .

		`` Shadow '' -LRB- in `` Everybody 's '' -RRB- | awakens all sorts of discussion , but at least ' attempts to deal honestly with a situation that i might arise in any neighborhood at any time .

		| `` A Hypothetical Case '' is the most tense and independent story in the list .

		On the other hand , `` Callum 's Co ` tin ' '' and `` His Excellency the Governor , '' bright com - edy though they are , belong after all to the school of Uncle Remus .

		`` Jungle Blood '' and `` The Chalk Game '' belong to the class that always regards the Negro as an animal , a minor , a plaything , but never as a man . ''

		Abram 's Freedom , '' exceedingly well writ - ten for two-thirds of the way , falls down hopelessly at the end .

		Many old Negroes after the Civil War preferred to remain with their former masters ; but certainly no young woman of the type of Emmeline would sell her birthright for a mess of pottage .

		Just there is the point .

		That the Negro is ever to be taken seriously is incomprehen - sible to some people .

		It is the story of `` The Man that Laughs '' over again .

		The more Gwynplaine protests , the more outlandish he becomes to the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are simply asking that those writers of fiction who deal with the Negro shall be thor - oughly honest with themselves , and not remain forever content to embalm old types and work over outworn ideas .

		Rather should they sift the present and forecast the future .

		But of course the editors must be considered .

		The editors must give their readers what the read - ers want ; and when we consider the populace , of course we have to reckon with the mob .

		And the mob does not find anything very attractive about a Negro who is intelligent , cultured , manly , and who does not smile .

		It will be observed that in no one of the ten stories above mentioned , not even in one of the five remarked most favorably , is there a Negro of this type .

		Yet he is obliged to come .

		America has yet to reckon with him .

		The day of Uncle Remus as well as of Uncle Tom is over .

		Even now , however , there are signs of bet - ter things .

		Such an artist as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, for instance , has once or twice dealt with the problem in excellent spirit .

		Then there is the work of the Negro writers themselves .

		The numerous attempts in fiction made by them have most frequently been open to the charge of crassness already considered ; but
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	,
Charles W. Chesnutt	PERSON	, and
W. E. Burghardt DuBois	PERSON	have risen above the crowd .

		Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	, of course , was better in poetry than in prose .

		Such a short story as `` Jimsella , '' however , exhibited considerable 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	technique .

		`` The Uncalled '' used a living topic , treated with only partial success .

		But for the most part , Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	's work looked toward the past .

		Somewhat stronger in prose is Mr.
Chesnutt	PERSON	.

		`` The Marrow of Tradi - tion '' is not much more than a political tract , and `` The Colonel 's Dream '' contains a good deal of preaching ; but `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	behind the Cedars '' is a real novel .

		Among his short stories , `` The Bouquet '' may be remarked for technical excellence , and `` The Wife of His Youth '' for a situation of unusual power .

		Professor
DuBois	PERSON	's `` The Quest of the Silver Fleece '' contains at least one strong dramatic situation ; but the author is a sociologist and essayist rather than a novelist .

		The grand epic of the race is yet to be produced .

		Some day we shall work out the problems of our great country .

		Some day we shall not have a state government set at defiance , and the massacre of Ludlow .

		Some day our little children will not slave in mines and mills , but will have some chance at the glory of God 's creation ; and some day the Negro will cease to be a problem and become a human being .

		Then , in truth , we shall have the Promised Land .

		But until that day comes let those who mould our ideals and set the standards of our art in fiction at least be honest with themselves and independent .

		Ignorance we may for a time forgive ; but a man has only himself to blame if he insists on not seeing the sunrise in the new day .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The war has interrupted the publication of a series of volumes which will be the delight of all lovers of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's essays .

		During the four closing years of his life , the famous moralist was engaged in preparing a new edition of his great work .

		His
Paris	LOCATION	pub - lisher , L'Angelier , had sent him a set , in sheets , of the latest edition at that time , that of
1588	DATE	; and on the margins and between the lines of these sheets , the philosopher penned numerous additions , modifications , and cor - rections , so that when he died in the
autumn of 1592	DATE	, the task was about completed , though he was unable to issue the new edition which he had contemplated .

		The publishing house of
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	is now engaged in reproducing by photo-typography these precious sheets ; the municipality of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, of which town Montaigne was a citizen , is paying the expense ; and the learned Professor
Fortunat Strowski	PERSON	, of
Paris University	ORGANIZATION	, is the respon - sible editor .

		Two volumes had appeared before the war broke out , and one more remains to be issued , when there will be three superb quartos of more than a thousand pages , each volume costing 250 francs .

		During a recent sojourn in
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, I was able not only to admire this interesting publi - cation , but , through the kindness of the polite archivist of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Jean de Maupassant	PERSON	, I was permitted to examine at my ease the unique original copy , the very pages on which this master-mind labored and where all his ways as a thinker and even his strong penmanship may be studied in undress .

		When Montaigne died ,
M. de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	tells me , these sheets were deposited by his widow with the monks of the convent of the Feuillants of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, in whose church the author was buried .

		In order the better to preserve these loose sheets , the monks handed them over to a binder , who did what these vandals so often do , trimmed the edges , `` in order to make a good job , '' as is always their excuse , with the usual result -LRB- which was almost a crime in this instance -RRB- that they destroyed many a word or parts of a word , and in some places even whole phrases , left by the rare pen of Montaigne .

		The appearance of another work , though of a quite different nature from that just men - tioned , has also been stopped by the war .

		I refer to the proposal to extract from the seven - teen volumes of `` L 'Em pire Liberal '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Gamier , 3 frs .

		50 each -RRB- , by the late
Emile Ollivier	PERSON	, two volumes of `` Personal Memoirs , '' in which would be given all the lighter and more anecdotic parts of the more extensive publication .

		Apropos of this undertaking , I have received from the widow of the last Premier of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	this history of the heavy task in which she participated with devotion and intelligence as amanuensis , counsellor , and collaborator : Immediately after the fall of his ministry ,
Emile Ollivier	PERSON	conceived the design of writing the history of the war of
1870	DATE	, in order to justify his country from the calumnies of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		With this end in view , he made many notes and drew up a memento , which recorded hour by hour all the events of the crisis which precipitated the conflict .

		But after the Peace of
Frankfort	LOCATION	, the virulence of his enemies made it im - possible for him to get a hearing for the truth and convinced him that the moment had not yet come to proclaim it .

		So it was not until
1894	DATE	, at the age of
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 sixty-nine , that he decided to publish his first volume .

		The plan of the whole enterprise embraced the history of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	from
1848	DATE	and the question of the
Nationalities	ORGANIZATION	from
1815	DATE	.

		Interrupted several times in his labors by fatigue and sickness , he did not reach the year
1870	DATE	until
1909	DATE	, when he was eighty , and until his subject already filled thirteen volumes .

		It was his intention to end the account with the events of
September 4 , 1870	DATE	, that is , the advent of the present Eepublic .

		Unfortunately the description of the battle of Sedan , which he supposed he had written at the very beginning of the undertaking , could not be found among his papers after his death , and , though he had only sketched the occurrences of
September 4	DATE	, the final volume was published by me last year as he had directed .

		But there are several instances where the war has been the indirect cause of gifts to the public art treasures of
France	LOCATION	.

		Let me cite one example of this which has come under my personal notice .

		M.
Jean Jacques Olivier	PERSON	, who has written so many beautifully illus - trated and learned studies on the French stage and who , I may say in passing , may lecture in the
United States	LOCATION	when the peace comes , has been prevented by ill health from taking any part in the struggle and has been forced to seek in
Italy	LOCATION	a milder climate than he could find in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		So , to show his love for his native land in the hour of her stress , he has parted with some of the best objects of his collections , and has just presented to the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	an oil portrait of the famous actor Le
Kain	PERSON	-LRB- 1728-78 -RRB- , by
Rosslin	PERSON	, and seven gouaches , representing leading French actors of the last century in their favorite roles , by
Fesch	PERSON	and Whirsker , of whom
M. Olivier	PERSON	writes me as follows : Very little is known of these two artists , who were born in
Bale	LOCATION	.

		They painted on parchment the actors of their time , observing in their work the greatest accuracy of detail .

		In their miniatures , costume , movement , physiognomy , all are faithfully noted , so that their portraits are of great documentary import - ance .

		After depicting the stars of the French and Italian operas of
Paris	LOCATION	, and those of the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	, they crossed the Channel and made a whole series of portraits of Garrick .

		These portraits , for which the great actor sat , were engraved and pub - lished in a volume entitled `` Les Grimaces de
David Garrick	PERSON	.

		* ' By the way , in his home on the
S. Maurizio	PERSON	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
M. Olivier	PERSON	is now engaged in writing a monograph on
Joseph Caillot	PERSON	and another on Mme.
Dugagne	PERSON	, `` two artists , '' he tells me , `` who sum up the history of the
Opera Comique	ORGANIZATION	from
1762	DATE	to
1800	DATE	, that is , the epoch of
Philidor	LOCATION	,
Monsigny	LOCATION	,
Gretry	LOCATION	,
Dalayrac	LOCATION	, etc. '' Among recent deaths in
France	LOCATION	, I wish to speak of at least two , that of the ex - Abbe
Marcel Hebert	PERSON	and that of Senator
Joseph Fabre	PERSON	.

		The first of these was one of those few broad-minded priests who have been brave enough to break with
Rome	LOCATION	.


William James	PERSON	called his book , `` Le Pragmatisme '' -LRB- third edition ,
1909	DATE	` i , `` a fairly instructive account '' ; and `` Le Divin '' he characterized `` one of the ablest reviews of the general subject of religious philosophy which recent years have produced . ''

		Perhaps the fullest and most sympathetic sketch of
Hebert	PERSON	's noble career is that given by his old friend ,
Abbe Albert Houtin	PERSON	, `` another heretic , '' one of his critics has designated him in his notable book , `` Histoire du Modernisme Catholique '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	;
1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		The latter possesses a long series of his unpublished letters , which will form the basis of a biographical notice of him , `` which I shall publish when the peace comes , '' he writes me .

		In the meantime , perhaps the best short printed narration of his life , especially the literary side , is
M. Felix Sartiaux	PERSON	's little arti - cle in the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' for
April 1	DATE	; while the following extract from a private letter to me from the former Abbe
Alfred Loisy	PERSON	, professor at the College of
France	LOCATION	, seems to me the most satisfactory unpublished eulogy which I have seen : With an open mind thirsting for knowledge , de - voted by nature , good as the best passages of the
Evangel	LOCATION	,
Hebert	PERSON	was a very remarkable educator , who inspired a body of young men with large and gener - ous ideas .

		There , probably , is his greatest work , though his philosophic , artistic , and archseologie writ - ings are of a high value .

		He was a man of the widest culture .

		Drawn towards the Church by a sentiment of lofty idealism , he left the ecclesiastic profession without renouncing this ideal to which he ever remained faithful .

		In fact , it may be truly said that he took this step in order that he might avail himself of this ideal with greater sincerity of purpose .

		A democrat and a socialist without being a party man , he loved the people and strove to enlighten them by lectures and newspaper articles , in order to lead them up towards those heights of the moral ideal without which life seemed to him devoid of sense and price .

		In a word ,
Hebert	PERSON	was one of those supremely fine characters who adequately redeem the defects of our poor human nature .

		For example , so modest was he that after his death , when a
Paris	LOCATION	periodical wished to give his portrait , not a single photograph of him could be found even among the members of his family .

		Though not exactly a materialist , he felt bound by no sect .

		He asked that in spe -LRB- `` I die in hope '' -RRB- be engraved on the urn which contained his ashes , for -LRB- his final heresy -RRB- he was cremated ; and `` these words , '' one of his friends remarked , `` expressed his whole faith . ''

		Some of the most liberal and most distinguished thinkers of
Paris	LOCATION	attended his funeral , and it was a
Monod	PERSON	who spoke at his tomb .

		The charm of his personality was extreme .

		One day in our American
Ambu	ORGANIZATION	- lance at
Neuilly	LOCATION	, I was attending a wounded youth who had sat under
Hebert	PERSON	's teachings , for during many years he was at the head of a famous priests ' school at
Paris	LOCATION	, and who said to me with a full heart when he learned 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	of `` the dear master 's death , '' that `` thoughts of him and of his precepts were the consola - tion of my cravings for the spiritual when I was in the nightmare of the trenches . ''

		Finally , he was the author of a half dozen or more able philosophical and religious volumes , and his great hero was
Joan of Arc	PERSON	, `` whom the Church slew and then resurrected . ''

		But it was
Joseph Fabre	PERSON	who was the modern French warden of the
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like
Hebert	PERSON	,
Fabre	PERSON	was one of those emancipated philosophical minds who have always been the charm of
France	LOCATION	and who know no sects or conventionalities .

		His ardent republicanism , his thirst to understand our American system , and his admiration for
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- he devoted a volume to him , perhaps two -RRB- and others of our really great public men , drew him closely to those few Americans perhaps , indeed , I was the only one who crossed his modest threshold in the shadows of the stately trees of the
Versailles	LOCATION	park .

		The dominant passion of the intellectual life of this humble son of the French peasantry his plain big-hearted old mother understood French but spoke only the patois of the
Aveyron	LOCATION	was the glorification of his sister peasant of Domremy .

		Early in his career he began to write about her ; he lectured about her ; he introduced bills into
Parliament	LOCATION	, where he had been both deputy and senator , about her ; and if
the Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	now fetes her memory each year in
Paris	LOCATION	, though in a spirit quite contrary to that which he inculcated , it is indirectly due to his propaganda .

		This veritable cult for `` the saint of
Rouen	LOCATION	'' culminated in a sort of mod - ern miracle-play , a musical-dramatic tragedy , which was given on two different occasions on the
Paris	LOCATION	stage in two different forms , and in fact was almost reproduced also at
New York	LOCATION	, the late
Augustin Daly	PERSON	having once entered into negotiations with the author with this end in view , `` for Ada Rehan is obsessed with the idea of portraying
Joan	PERSON	of Arc . ''

		The affair finally fell through , but just for what reason I have forgotten , and the American public missed seeing and applauding a beautifully idealistic , a highly artistic , and a deeply patri - otic piece .

		I may add that
M. Joseph Hild	PERSON	, a distinguished member of the
Paris	LOCATION	bar and a warm friend of the late Senator , is now engaged in assorting his papers , and informs me that here too we may expect an interesting biographical memoir in due season .

		A similar pious act is being performed with the papers of the late
Stuart Merrill	PERSON	by his friends ,
M. Ferdinand Herold	PERSON	and
M. Albert Mockel	PERSON	, the well-known
Paris	LOCATION	litterateurs .

		The latter writes me : I have nearly finished drawing up the bibliography of the poet 's posthumous works , which I mean to publish , along with my study of him which appeared in the Mercure de
France	LOCATION	immediately after his death , in a small volume , where you will find , I think , the most interesting things to be a series of translation of poems in French prose not included in his '' Pastels in Prose , '' some of which , though unsigned , are by
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	himself , as I have just discovered .

		Then there is a translation in verse of a series of French poems and a translation in French of one of
James Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's poems .

		But the fame of another American man of letters who was far nearer being a genius than was
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	has never , oddly enough , come within the ken of literary
France	LOCATION	.

		I refer to
Sydney Porter	ORGANIZATION	.

		By way of explanation of this remark , I should state that Professor
Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, is preparing a biography of `` 0 .

		Henry '' which will be ready for the press in the early autumn .

		I understand that it will be a rather complete exposition of the formative influences that entered into the life and work of this brilliant story-teller during his early years in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, together with a detailed study of the form and content of his writings .

		`` He and I were intimate boyhood chums , '' Professor
Smith	PERSON	once said to me , `` and I find myself interested more than I can say in this development of a youthful genius whom everybody loved in his early years and whose memory we cherish with the utmost regard and affection . ''

		This forthcoming book , and Professor
Smith	PERSON	's enthusiasm for his friend , led me to reflect on the fact indeed , I asked myself if it was a fact that `` 0 .

		Henry '' was utterly unknown in
France	LOCATION	, though the
Paris National Library	ORGANIZATION	has on its shelves ten volumes of his fiction , one of which curiously enough appears to have reached its final rest - ing place through the French dead-letter office .

		The other nine , I am assured , though I am tempted to question the correctness of this assertion , were bought by the library .

		When I expressed surprise that the very limited resources of this institution should be spent on an author so little appreciated , one of the librarians made this reply : `` If 0 .

		Henry is not very well known in
France	LOCATION	, he deserves to be .

		We saw in the '
Encyclopaedia Britannica	LOCATION	, ' which contains annual supple - ments of literary criticisms , that this author stood very high in
America	LOCATION	.

		So we thought it would be interesting to enrich our collections by adding thereto his works ; hence these purchases . ''

		But lest my own observations should be at fault , I have turned to several of my French literary friends , and I find that their opinion on this matter agrees exactly with my own .

		Thus ,
M. Schalck de la Faverie	ORGANIZATION	, of the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, says : `` As far as I
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 453 am aware , this author is unknown in
France	LOCATION	'' ; 1 while
M. Henry D. Davray	PERSON	, the critic for English books of the ^ Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, '' is even more pronounced in his statement : `` I do not know anything about
O. Henry	PERSON	, have never seen any study of his work , or heard j of any of his stories being translated into our j language . ''

		The
National Library	ORGANIZATION	also records j the fact that none of `` 0 .

		Henry 's '' stories has ' been translated and published in book form in
France	LOCATION	.

		I say translated and published , \ for I chance to know that one has been trans - ; lated ; and hereby hangs a rather curious tale .

		-LSB- The French translation rights of '' ` Mr.
\ Valentine	PERSON	's New Profession , '' first printed in
September 1903	DATE	, in `` The
London	LOCATION	Magazine , '' j were sold in
June , 1909	DATE	, to Mr.
A. Foulcher	PERSON	, ; a French civil engineer , with literary tastes and a perfect knowledge of our language , who is now in the army .

		He writes me as follows j from
Lyons	PERSON	, where he is at present stationed : `` Mr.
Valentine	PERSON	's New Profession , '' the only thing of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	's I ever translated , has a rather queer history in so far as I am concerned .

		I sent the manuscript to several periodicals , all of which declined !

		it .

		But it suited the taste of a clever but not over - j scrupulous well-known writer who made a scenic j adaptation of it , of course without my consent or even I knowledge ; so that some five or six years ago , enter - ing by chance the Vaudeville one fine evening , I had the pleasure of assisting at the performance of Mr.
' Valentine	PERSON	's feats in which of course I found neither ' .

		glory nor profits .

		Mr.
Valentine	PERSON	had once more changed his name , but he was the same man and played the same trick on the safe .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE HOUSE OF
HARPER	PERSON	'S REMOVAL FROM FRANK - LIN SQUARE in the near future , as announced by that century-old publishing house , will be an event of importance in the publishing world .

		It will be a centennial event , if it falls within the next calendar year , for it was in
1817	DATE	that the firm of
J. & J. Harper	ORGANIZATION	first started in business in a little Dover-Street room not far from the present estab - j lishment bearing the
Harper	PERSON	name .

		Fulton Street , j Pearl Street , and Cliff Street were successively the scenes of these publishing activities of the Har - j pers , and the building now occupied by the firm j dates from
1854	DATE	, when , in consequence of a disas - j trous fire in
December , 1853	DATE	, work was started i upon a fire-proof and up-to-date building , large I enough for years of future growth , and as per - j fectly equipped as it was then possible to make it .

		For a brief moment , but no longer , the burnt-out partners had considered the advisability of not | trying to imitate the phoenix , of abandoning the plan of rising from their ashes , of retiring on their already considerable fortune ; then they were reminded of their sons and their sons ' sons , and of the still remoter posterity to whom they owed it to hand on the business , and rebuilding began .

		A notable fact is it , in this connection , that not one member of the
Harper	PERSON	family is to-day prom - inent in the management of the business .

		At least , no
Harper	PERSON	is on the present
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Up-town this old publishing house will move , like so many other similar firms within the
last quarter	DATE	- century , and the historic building in the square named , not from
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, but from the merchant
Walter Franklin	PERSON	, will echo no more to the tread of Mr.
Henry Mills Alden	PERSON	, of Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, of Colonel
George Harvey	PERSON	, and of all the others who have for many or fewer years contributed to the success of the
House of Harper	ORGANIZATION	.

		For further details of the firm 's his - tory the reader is referred to the rich volume of memories and anecdotes put forth four years ago by Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	under the title , `` The House of
Harper	PERSON	. ''

		A FAMOUS OLD DRAMATIC COMPANY , the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	, which had its beginning in the Theatre de 1 ` Hotel Bourgogne -LRB- founded in
1552	DATE	-RRB- and has even since , with a brief interruption in
1793	DATE	, con - tributed to the amusement of Parisian play-goers , is said to be contemplating a visit to this country next season .

		Never before has the company gone on tour outside its native
France	LOCATION	, it is affirmed in emphasis of the importance and the high honor to us of the projected departure from custom .

		The
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	is in effect a national institu - tion , receiving an annual subsidy from the govern - ment and controlled by a governing board which in turn is supervised by government officials .

		Con - sequently its coming to our shores will be regarded as something akin to a national expression of friendship toward a sister republic .

		From indi - vidual members of this aggregation of talented actors we have had not a few visits , notably from Mounet-Sully ,
Coquelin	LOCATION	, and
Madame Sarah Bern	PERSON	- hardt -LRB- but only after the tetter 's early severance of relations with the company -RRB- .

		Though 1552 is given above as the date of the company 's birth , it was not until
1680	DATE	that it assumed something of its present character , with royal recognition and a sounding name , `` L'Hotel des Comediens du Roi entretenus par Sa Majeste . ''

		Nine years later it became the `` Comedie Franchise , '' which it has since remained , though often referred to as the `` Theatre Fran?ais , '' since this historic playhouse -LRB- almost destroyed by fire eight years ago -RRB- is its home .

		A PHILOLOGIST AND MORE THAN A PHILOLOGIST , a scholar keenly appreciative of the niceties of speech , especially in their literary application , and a noted teacher of the subjects that so deeply inter - ested him , died suddenly at
Washington	LOCATION	,
D. C.	ORGANIZATION	,
April 18	DATE	.

		Professor
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	, to whom reference is here made , has left to the world one book that deserves to rank among the more notable examples of personal reminiscence : it is his account of his German-student days at Gb ` t - tingen , an inspiring narrative that has turned the steps of many a candidate for a degree made in
Germany	LOCATION	toward the old Hanoverian town famous 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	for its university and its sausages .

		After reading this book -LRB- `` German Universities '' -RRB- any one inter - ested in the writer , his character and his achieve - ments , would do well to open next Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's `` Memories of My Youth '' at the ninth chapter , where is given an entertaining account of the young
Princeton	LOCATION	graduate as viewed in the intimacy existing between room - mates in a strange land .

		Though a student of jurisprudence at that time ,
Hart	PERSON	soon transferred his affections to more liberal studies , and four years after winning his doctorate -LRB- J.U.D. -RRB- at
Gottingen	LOCATION	was teaching modern languages at Cor - nell .

		A little later he taught these and also English literature at
the University of Cincinnati	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1890	DATE	he was appointed to the chair of English language and literature at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, in
1907	DATE	was made professor emeritus , and was still a resident of
Ithaca	LOCATION	when death overtook him in the southern city where he had been spending the
past winter	DATE	.

		Among his published works are `` Essentials of Prose Composition , '' `` Standard English Speech in Outline , '' and various German texts and other books edited or translated by him .

		He was born
Nov. 2 , 1839	DATE	, at
Princeton	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, where he received his A.B. in
1860	DATE	, his
A.M. three years later	DATE	, also his L.H.D. in
1900	DATE	.

		THE BLUE PENCIL Is a small implement , but its office is not a despicable one .

		Perhaps it even deserves to rank with the `` very small helm '' that turns the big ship , and with the `` little member '' that nevertheless `` boasteth great things . ''

		As a ready and effective means of emphasis , a useful instrument for arresting a reader 's attention , it is beyond praise .

		When your friend in a distant city sends you a newspaper containing some para - graph or short article he wishes you to read , how difficult it is to find this paragraph or article if it be only slightly marked with a hard lead pencil , as it commonly is .

		But if with one bold stroke of blue your friend has indicated what you are to read , how quickly that passage leaps to the eye !

		Reports of learned and other institutions , with many like pamphlets and documents , come to our desk with no helpful , time-saving blue - pencillings to show at a glance the significant features on which our comment is invited .

		Other reports and pamphlets and similar documents there are , far fewer in number , that come with careful markings of indigo hue to lighten the examiner 's task .

		Latest among these judiciously marked pub - lications is the Twelfth Annual Report of the
Waterloo	LOCATION	-LRB-
Iowa	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library .

		Waterloo is not a large city , and its library might not be con - sidered especially important among the hundreds , if not thousands , of libraries to which we should be glad to call attention if our space were unlim - ited ; but with a few notable items made conspicu - ous in blue how can one refuse to recognize their significance ?

		For example ,
Waterloo	LOCATION	readers are awaking to the fact that there are interesting books outside the fiction class .

		They have borrowed , in the last year , nearly seven thousand more serious works and nearly three thousand five hundred fewer novels than the year before .

		There was a considerable gain in total circulation far greater than the increase of books on the shelves , which is much more creditable than would have been the reverse .

		Reference-room work seems to have increased by about one-half .

		Our thanks to Miss Brace and her blue pencil !

		POST - VICTORIAN LITERARY ANTICS are amusingly exhibited to view in `` The End of a Chapter '' -LRB- elsewhere noticed more fully -RRB- by Mr.
Shane Leslie	PERSON	, who gravely declares that he has `` witnessed the suicide of the civilization called Christian '' and dedicates his book `` to the memory of those who have died before the next chapter has begun . ''

		After
Victoria	PERSON	the literature of her realm `` passed from an Augustan age straight to that of brass .

		There was no intermediary age of silver . ''

		It was typical of this decadence , Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	says , that after
1900	DATE	everybody pretended to have read Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, whom before that date everybody pretended not to have read .

		Under
King Edward `` Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	were dismissed as grand - motherly .

		The latter was sent to
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	and the former to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Swinburne was hailed as the only poet of his era , about twenty years after he had ceased to write good poetry . ''

		Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton came and in a scintillant but irritating style `` smilingly stood Truth upon her head to explain the
Universal Antipodes	ORGANIZATION	in which we all have our being . ''

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	`` may have had an artistic and a dramatic message to deliver , but he could not forego the cheapest advertisement of the prophet . ''

		But his vogue `` endured until the futur - ists swept into undisputed mastery of the powers of topsyturvydom . ''

		In one pungent paragraph the author describes how , with the opening of the new century , `` there was a cry for something wilder than
Scott	PERSON	, for something more gloomy than the Brontes , for something more sexual than
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Dickens and
Miss Austen	PERSON	were as forgotten as the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	.

		Even novelists who had begun writing in the Victorian age developed new and unexpected methods .

		Wells poured the laboratory , and
George Moore	PERSON	the lavatory , into their books . ''

		Perhaps a sufficient note on all this is that it was written or at least conceived in the atmosphere of a military hospital , the writer being one of the victims of the Great War .

		LANGUAGE-MAKING IN THE TRENCHES is one of the few purely intellectual and unsanguinary activ - ities now going on at the battle-front .

		As was to have been expected , the Trench have shown them - selves most expert and nimble-witted at this exer - cise , though the English Tommies are not far behind .

		The busy
Berthas	LOCATION	and
Jack Johnsons	PERSON	, the whizz-bangs , crumps , and Archibalds have been made famous by the latter .

		A
London	LOCATION	`` Evening Standard '' writer calls attention to a number of ingenious and amusing French terms facetiously expressive of grim realities in trench warfare .

		To the `` poilu , '' or unshaven warrior of necessarily rare recourse to the barber , his bayonet is , in expressive slang which we here translate , a turn - spit , also a knitting-needle ; and in his sentimental
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 455 moods he calls it Rosalie .

		The bullets with which he feeds his rifle are styled sometimes chestnuts , sometimes plums .

		Flower-pot is the term for his cap , and the head it covers is a lemon -LRB- citron -RRB- .

		When he runs -LRB- never away from the fight , of course -RRB- he `` knits his legs '' ; and when coffee is served out to him he calls it juice .

		The regimental tailor is a prick-thumb , and the colonel is , fami - liarly , the colo. .

		The now well-known term ,
Boche	LOCATION	, which the Germans themselves have gravely decided , after a trial by court-martial , to be expressive of derision and contempt , the writer here quoted regards as apparently a `` back-slang '' corruption of Schwob , the Alsatian 's colloquial designation for his German master .

		There was an old variation , `` Alboche , '' which may have been a similar reversed corruption of ``
Schwalbe	PERSON	. ''

		In much of this language-making is to be seen the same euphemistic tendency that caused the ancient Greeks to call the Furies the Eumenides -LRB- the gra - cious ones -RRB- , and to propitiate the powers of dark - ness with flattering names .

		Autres temps , autres masurs , but ever the same human nature at bottom .

		HOW ONE LIBRARY DISPOSES OF ITS OUTWORN BOOKS is explained by the Cedar Rapids librarian in her current Report , and her account may be use - fully suggestive to others .

		Discarded literature of all sorts , both books and duplicate magazines , she sends to the local jail , where the police matron takes it in charge and distributes it among the occu - pants of the institution , `` that they may read during their confinement .

		This is a harmless occu - pation , and it is much better than for these unfortunates to brood over their condition and become embittered . ''

		`` Well said ; and one can not but hope that now and then some well-chosen book may help the reader to persuade himself , with
Lovelace	PERSON	, that stone walls do not a prison make , nor iron bars a cage , though he may lack the inno - cent and quiet mind of the poet .

		It is significant that volunteer workers among the millions of war prisoners now eating the bread of enforced idleness report that one of the most pressing demands on the part of these millions is for food for the mind rather than for the body .

		Magazines , newspapers , almost anything cheerfully distracting in the way of reading matter , they eagerly welcome .

		Un - doubtedly the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	organization that is now active in this prison work could make good use of much more literature of a suitable kind than it has at its disposal .

		MORTALITY AMONG MAGAZINES is so great that it might be supposed to discourage any and all attempts to start new ventures in this field in the future .

		But it will not .

		`` Live and learn '' is the rule in magazine-making as elsewhere .

		Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- regor
Jenkins	PERSON	, publisher of `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' recently told the members of the
Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Englewood	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	.

		some rather startling facts concerning magazine-publishing .

		Less than a year ago there were in this country 3,410 magazines enjoying a more or less assured existence , though very few of them having any - thing like a nation-wide circulation : and to-day there are but 2,700 .

		Encouraging is his assertion that the oldest survivors are those that make a determined effort to give their readers the best that is to be had in current literature .

		That the magazine 's fate depends pre-eminently on the occu - pant of its editorial chair is not surprising , though how few readers ever give a thought to that usually anonymous and very seldom conspicuously prom - inent person !

		What mountains of unreadable trash he and his assistants must have to plough through , in some fashion , and keep from working the ruin of the magazine for whose pages it is fatuously intended !

		Among rejected contribu - tions exhibited by Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	as specimens of this sort of trash were `` An Ode to a Cold Pan - cake , '' `` Little Willie Went Fishing , '' and other productions , illiterate and nonsensical to a degree that passes belief .

		Their admission to any maga - zine would speedily raise the already high rate of magazine mortality .

		`` JOY-READING '' has a far higher standing in our vocabulary than `` joy-riding . ''

		In the latest Report of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Sherman Williams	PERSON	, of the
School Libraries Division	ORGANIZATION	, uses the term to good purpose in commenting on the defects in literature-teaching as noted by many observers .

		Too much pedantry , too much dissec - tion of literary masterpieces , too much of formal examination at stated times , and too little of `` joy - reading '' that , in - brief , is the ailment afflicting literature-teaching in high schools , and elsewhere .

		Pupils from homes where the reading of good books is as much a matter of course as the eating of good food have more of literary culture at the very outset of their high-school training than others can show at the end .

		`` A formal examina - tion in literature , '' remarks Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, `` is the best possible way to make a child dislike literature .

		It has been very effective for a long series of years .

		Is it not time to try something else ?

		Let them read and read read extensively and about what they will guiding them by suggestion rather than direction . ''

		And he points out that high-school libraries are too largely composed of books for mature readers ; they should have more books that are a joy and delight to the normal growing lad and ripening young woman .

		The `` joy-reader '' will go farther and profit more in an hour than the heavy-hearted reader under compulsion in a year , or a century .

		THE REAL
DAVID GRAYSON	PERSON	has at last been found to be Mr.
Ray Stannard Baker	PERSON	, not a peaceful agriculturist at all , but a very energetic , even aggressive , journalist , magazinist , investigator of social conditions , and prolific author of various kinds of books .

		The only touch of similarity with
David Grayson	PERSON	that one discovers in Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's biography is noted in the fact that agricultural studies were at one period of early life his chief interest .

		He was graduated from the
Michigan Agricultural College	ORGANIZATION	in
1889	DATE	at the age of nine - teen .

		After that he took a partial law course and pursued literary studies at
the University of Mich	ORGANIZATION	- igan .

		Newspaper work in
Chicago	LOCATION	soon followed , 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	then magazine editorship under Mr.
McClure	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	, and since
1906	DATE	he has been one of the owners and editors of `` The American Magazine . ''

		A wide range of talents is exhibited by his half - score or more books , from `` The Boys ' Book of Inventions '' and `` Our New Prosperity '' to `` Adven - tures in Contentment '' and `` The Friendly Road . ''

		The
Grayson	PERSON	sketches , it appears , started as recre - ational note-book jottings in the intervals between strenuous days of study in the evils of our social and industrial life .

		Pressed for matter to fill the pages of the magazine which he , with others , had taken control of , he brought out his note-book and threw some of its contents into shape for pub - lication , under the pseudonym of ``
David Gray	PERSON	- son . ''

		Their success was a surprise to him , but not to his readers .

		A NOTE ON NEW FICTION , on the demand for it in comparison with the steady call for the old story - tellers , and on the amount of money spent in its purchase , catches the eye in Librarian Hill 's record of a year 's activity at the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		After speaking of the proper place filled by novels in the people 's free library , notwithstanding certain recent objections , he reports that in the library under his superintendence `` the sum of
$ 95,003	MONEY	was spent for books in
1915	DATE	, and of this amount only seven per cent , was for new fiction issued within a year .

		The circulation of all fiction was 3,977,998 , of which about nine per cent , represented novels published within a year . ''

		Exceptional and inter - esting is this presentation of a comparative record of old and new fiction circulation .

		If all library statistics were equally detailed in this particular , it might be possible to draw some instructive general conclusions , either encouraging or discouraging .

		But at the same time it would be necessary to know how liberal the institution in question had been in offering current fiction to its patrons , how great the temptation it had held out to forsake the approved romancers of the past for the untried or little-tried novelists of the present .

		LITERARY RARITIES TURNED TO CHARITABLE USES , the pen employed to heal the wounds of the sword such is the spectacle now beheld , if recent reports from
London	LOCATION	are to be credited , in the sale of certain valuable manuscripts and books in aid of the
British Red Cross Society	ORGANIZATION	and the Order of the
Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem	ORGANIZATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		`` A Christmas Garland , '' by Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	, with caricatures of the subject of each chapter from the same hand , was among the more notable items sold under the hammer at
Christie 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		With caricature portraits of such celebrities as Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, and
George Meredith	PERSON	there was left a blank page for similar treatment of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	`` pending ful - filment of our hope that health and activity will yet be given back to the consummate -LSB- artist -RSB- and well-beloved man whose work is here parodied . ''

		This clever work was presented by its artificer .

		The Marquis of Crew gave Lord
Byron	PERSON	's copy of `` Plini Panegyricus '' with his signature , ``
Byron	PERSON	,
Trin	LOCATION	.

		Col.
1808	DATE	. ''

		There were also a first edition of
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Christmas Carol , '' with illustrations by
Leech	ORGANIZATION	and a letter by the author ; a first edition of
Blake	PERSON	's `` Vision of the Daughters of
Albion	LOCATION	, '' with eleven plates ; a copy on vellum of the `` Horae Veatffi Maria ?

		Virginis , '' and other works precious in the collector 's eyes .

		Good prices were obtained .

		DRY STATISTICS , in a peculiar sense of the adjec - tive , come to us from far-away Puget Sound .

		The city of
Seattle	LOCATION	, while the
State	ORGANIZATION	of
Washington	LOCATION	was still a `` wet '' state in the colloquial signification of the term , was able each year to devote about
$ 45,000	MONEY	from license fees to the circulation of good literature among its citizens .

		In other words , its public library profited to that extent from the indulgence in liquid refreshment of an intoxicating nature on the part of those within its gates -LRB- or a fraction of them -RRB- .

		Last year , with
Washington	LOCATION	enrolled among the `` dry '' states , the entire receipts for library uses from `` licenses , fines , and fees '' amounted to less than half as much , or
$ 21,531.55	MONEY	.

		That is , with the closing of the saloons and , in consequence , a presumably greater resort to the library and its branches on the part of those for - merly lured in other directions , the means for ministering to their needs as information-seeking , book-reading , or only magazine-reading and news - paper-browsing members of the body politic , become materially diminished .

		This anomaly , the partial dependence of the public library in many cities on liquor-license fees and police-court fines , has been commented on before in these columns , and it is likely to be commented on again before it ceases to exist .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		WAS `` SHAKSPERE '' '' SHAKE-SPEARE '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Recently Baconians a term of convenience -LRB- like Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's `` Dryasdusts '' for everybody who insists on facts and logic -RRB- that I shall apply to all the different varieties of anti-Stratfordeans , e.g. , Baconians proper ,
Raleighans	LOCATION	,
Stanleyites	LOCATION	,
Rutlanders	ORGANIZATION	,
Marlowites	LOCATION	, etc. , have made it a strong argument against the
Stratfordean	ORGANIZATION	's claim to the paternity of the plays and poems attributed to him by the saner portion of mankind that his surname is not the same as that of the
London	LOCATION	poet .

		They assert , vehemently and without any facts to support their assertions , that the unknown Londoner , whoever he was , wrote under the pseudo - nym Shake-speare or Shakespeare and was almost always thus referred to , whereas the Stratfordean actor 's and money-lender 's name was always written Shakspere ,
Shaxberd	ORGANIZATION	, Shackespur , or in some similarly shortened form , without a hyphen between the two syllables , without an e after the k , and , above all , without an a in the second syllable , and that these two names were not even pronounced alike .

		As Mr.
Fraser	PERSON	puts it , `` these names were vocally and etymologically different . ''

		Do the known facts concerning the Shakespeare surname justify these bold assertions ?

		If they do , we have
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 all these years worshipped at the wrong shrine and our tercentenary celebration is a mockery .

		In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , English spelling was even more unauthorized , for - tuitous , and chaotic than it is now .

		Englishmen did not spell their names and their language uniformly because they were not educated to do so and because they did not attach any importance to the subject .

		The schools had no courses in English ; there were no spelling-bees then -LRB- any more than we have in alien tongues -RRB- , and people did not ask each other how they spelt their names .

		These facts , taken in connection with the non-existence of an English dictionary prior to
1604	DATE	, together with the then scarcity of books among the common people , sufficiently account for the multitudinous forms which ordinary words and names assumed in the Elizabethan era .

		Elizabethans spelled phonetically , or tried to do so .

		Inasmuch as in the English language almost each sound is represent - .

		able by one or more letters or combinations of 1 letters , and inasmuch as many letters do service for more than one sound , the particular form that any word or name assumed on the written page depended as much upon the whim , fancy , or : caprice of the moment as upon the education and habits of the writer .

		Our modern spelling , espe - cially of surnames , is almost as whimsical and capricious as theirs was .

		It is therefore not at all surprising to find Elizabethan Englishmen spelling ordinary words , and even their own names or those of their immediate relatives , differently on different ; occasions or even on the same occasion .

		The larger ; the number of sounds in a word or name the larger ; the number of variations in its spelling .

		Shakespeare 's name contains seven sounds , and it was therefore capable of a great many different spellings .

		A certain Mr.
Wise	PERSON	made a list of four \ thousand ways of spelling `` Shakespeare . ''

		Mr. : Wise 's estimate is a very modest one .

		Considering j that six of the seven sounds of which the poet 's name is composed can be represented by several different letters or groups of letters -LRB- e. g. , the first sound by s , sh , sch , ss , ssh , ch ; the second by a , ea , \ ai , ay , e , o : the third and fourth by cs , ccs , chs , qus , ; ques , ks , kes , kss , cks , ekes , kys , ckys , kis , x , xs , I .

		rks , xkes , gs , etc. ; the fifth by p , b , ph ; the sixth by a. e , ee , ei , ey , ea , i , and u , all with or without a final e ; the seventh by r , rr , rd -RRB- , there is almost no limit to the number of variations of which this .

		name is capable .

		If each one of the seven sounds in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name were capable of being written by only four different letters or letter - groups , there would be 16,384 ways of spelling this name according to English orthography .

		And yet j it was actually spelled only in some fifty or sixty j ways !

		In the records of the Corporation of
Stratford	LOCATION	the name
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	occurs 161 times -LRB- Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	incorrectly says 66 -RRB- , and is spelled in fifteen -LRB- Lee says sixteen -RRB- different ways in the following !

		order of frequency : Shaxpeare -LRB- 69 -RRB- ,
Shaxpere	PERSON	' -LRB- 18 -RRB- ,
Shakspeyr	PERSON	-LRB- 17 -RRB- , Shakespere -LRB- 13 -RRB- ,
Shaks	PERSON	- \ peare -LRB- 9 -RRB- , Shakyspere -LRB- 9 -RRB- , etc. .

		And yet Mr.
' Greenwood	PERSON	says there was no `` Shake '' in the j Stratfordean 's name !

Shacke	PERSON	- spere -LRB- 32 -RRB- ,
Shaxspere	PERSON	-LRB- 31 -RRB- , etc. .

		It is to be noted that there is an e at the end of the first syllable in thirty-eight per cent , and an t or a t / -LRB- the occa - sional equivalent of an e -RRB- in three and a half per cent more .

		And yet Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	says there was no `` Shake '' in the Stratfordean 's name !

		Perfectly characteristic of the methods of the Baconians in presenting their case is Mr.
Green	PERSON	- wood 's frequent references to
Shaxberd	LOCATION	,
Shagspere	LOCATION	,
Shagspur	PERSON	, and
Shaxpur	PERSON	, instilling into his readers ' minds the belief that the actor 's name was most frequently so written by his acquaintances and associates .

		What are the facts ?

		Shagspere occurs only seventeen times , a little over two per cent ; Shagspur is nowhere to be found ; Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's assertion that `` Shaxpur is another well-known variant '' is quite untrue , for it exists nowhere but in the fantasies of
Baconians	LOCATION	; and the form Shaxberd occurs only a few times and only in literary
London	LOCATION	, in documents of purely literary interest !

		Reading Messrs.
Greenwood	PERSON	,
Baxter	LOCATION	,
Fraser	PERSON	, et id genus omne , one would infer that literary circles in
London	LOCATION	were unanimous in writing the poet 's name Shakespeare or Shake-speare .

		But the truth is that Londoners were just as variable and unresolved as to the orthography of the popular dramatist 's name as were the `` boors '' of the provinces .

		It is true that the majority of the printed mentions of the name show the forms just mentioned .

		But there are many exceptions .

		On the title-page of `` Love 's Labor 's Lost '' -LRB- 1598 -RRB- and of u The Passionate Pilgrim '' -LRB- 1612 -RRB- we find Shakespere , of `` Kong Lear '' -LRB- 1608 -RRB- Shak-speare , and of `` The Two Noble Kinsmen '' -LRB- 1634 -RRB-
Shak	PERSON	- speare .

		Other printed forms are Shake-spear , Shak-spear , and
Shakespear	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	manuscript references to the poet and his family are generally anything but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these we find Shaxberd -LRB- 1604-5 -RRB- ,
Shakespere	LOCATION	,
Shakspeer	PERSON	, Shack - spheere -LRB- 1627 -RRB- , Shackspare -LRB- 1619 -RRB- ,
Shakspere	LOCATION	, Shaks per -LRB- by
Edward Alleyn	PERSON	! -RRB-

		,
Shakspeare	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The officials of the
College of Heraldry	ORGANIZATION	wrote either Shakespeare or Shakespere .

		In
London	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name was written and printed in not less than twenty different ways , at least nine of 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	which -LRB- Shakesbere ,
Shackspeere	LOCATION	,
Shakspeer	LOCATION	,
Shak	PERSON	- speare , Shake-spectre , Shake-spear ,
Sheakspeare	LOCATION	,
Shakespheare	LOCATION	, Shaxberd -RRB- are peculiar to the metropolis , and in all of these there is no doubt that the poet was meant .

		Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's state - ment that the form Shakespeare `` has the pre - dominant sanction of legal and literary usage '' is grossly erroneous .

		In truth and in fact , legal documents pertaining to the poet 's property are overwhelmingly in favor of a shortened form of the name , especially as regards the omission of the a in the second syllable .

		Literary usage was as variable as legal usage .

		To speak of a `` literary form '' of the name is an absurdity .

		A number of orthodox Shakespeareans and , of course , all Baconians , have asserted that in the provinces the first syllable of the actor-poet 's sur - name must have been pronounced short because six-tenths of the time it was written without an e -LRB- i or y the occasional equivalents of e -RRB- after the k .

		If this is true of the provinces , it is also true of
London	LOCATION	, for only in the printing offices was the name generally spelled with an e at the end of the first syllable .

		But all these writers have dis - regarded , or been ignorant of , the fact that in the reigns of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
James	PERSON	there was no rule requiring a final e to indicate the length of a pre - ceding vowel , and that Elizabethan writers and printers employed or omitted the final e as suited their fancy .

		-LRB- Even to-day the sound of a in `` far , '' etc. , the sound this vowel had in the Elizabethan `` shake , '' does not require a final e. -RRB- Salesbury , writing about the middle of the sixteenth century , tells us that the use of silent e was kept up for the convenience of printers `` in consideration of iustifying of the lynes . ''

		When , at the close of the middle English period , all final e 's were dropped in pronunciation they were naturally also omitted in spelling , especially in the first syllable of compound words , e.g. , `` wherof , '' `` elswhere , '' `` her - after , '' `` therof , '' `` somwhat , '' etc. , and in sur - names composed of two words .

		That is why the e is so often omitted from the first syllable of the poet 's name not only in provincial records but also in the vast majority of unprinted
London	LOCATION	records .

		These facts also explain why in approximately twenty per cent of the non-literary occurrences of the name there is no e at the end of the second syllable .

		The presence or absence of a final e had no influence whatever on the pronunciation of a sylla - ble or of the vowel sound in the syllable .

		In
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's day , even more than now , an individual writer 's spelling was no guide to his pronunciation , inasmuch as each vowel had several phonetic values .

		Nothing is more certain than that Elizabethan writers did not associate a different pronunciation with a somewhat different spelling .

		Elizabethan and Jacobean manuscripts and printed books abundantly prove this .

		-LRB- Even to-day such differ - ent spellings as `` pear , '' `` pair , '' and `` pare '' have the same sound . -RRB-

		That `` spere '' or `` sper '' was the phonetic equivalent of `` spear '' or `` speare '' is proved , apart from etymological and other con - siderations -LRB- e.g. , variant texts -RRB- , by the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	coat-of-arms , which exhibits a falcon shaking a spear .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's references to the `` spur - jingling form '' of the
Stratfordean	PERSON	's name is a piece of jugglery and misrepresentation perfectly characteristic of the whole ilk of Baconians .

		His statement that the
College	ORGANIZATION	assigned `` the spear - shaking name '' to `` Shakspere '' because `` Shaksper '' would not have commended itself to them for pictorial purposes embodies a falsehood .

		The Heralds wrote indifferently Shakespere or Shake - speare , never Shakspere .

		Besides , why did Shakespeare have to have a canting pattern sug - gesting his name ?

		And why does a spur not commend itself for pictorial purposes as well as a spear ?

		To most of us a jingling spur sounds as heroical as a shaking spear , perhaps more so , and is as suggestive of a military origin .

		Baconians pretend to find a great deal of sig - nificance in the fact that in a large number of printed references to the great poet the name is printed with a hyphen between the two syllables .

		There were several reasons for the use of the hyphen in Elizabethan printing shops .

		In the first place , it was often used for no better reason than what Salesbury tells us about the use of final e .

		In the first folio we often find words connected with a hyphen -LRB- e.g. , `` fowle-play , '' `` sea-storme , '' `` Ayrie-charme , '' `` worlds-stage , '' `` holiday-foole , '' etc. -RRB- for no apparent reason .

		In the second place , Elizabethan and Jacobean compositors seem to have been instructed to indicate the composition of compound words and phrases by the introduction of a hyphen between the word components .

		That is why we find in the folio the following : `` a-boord , '' `` Bote-swaine , '' `` out-live , '' `` un-heard , '' `` mid - night , '' `` eye-lid , '' `` non-pareill , '' `` Pre-thee , '' `` Com - mon-wealth , '' etc. .

		Gratuitous and ridiculous etymologizing was one of the fashions of the printers of that day .

		Another and very important reason for the excessive use of the hyphen was to indicate that the hyphenated word-group was to be accented on the first element , e. g. , `` horse-man , '' `` good-man , '' `` young-man , '' `` true-man , '' `` half - Sword , '' `` tyring-house , '' `` spend-thrift , '' `` Fly-me , '' `` Shake-spear , '' etc. .

		It goes without saying that printers would be more likely to aim at some kind of uniformity in orthography than writers .

		An examination of a large number of Elizabethan manuscripts shows that the hyphen was very rarely employed in writing and not at all in the writing of surnames .

		There is absolutely not a particle of reason for doubting that `` Shakspere of
Stratford	LOCATION	was `` Shakespeare '' of
London	LOCATION	.


SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	,
May 5 , 1916	DATE	.

		POE 'S FIRST
LONDON	LOCATION	SCHOOL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As an addendum to Professor
Killis Campbell	PERSON	's important article in your issue of
Feb. 17	DATE	entitled `` New Notes on
Poe	PERSON	's Early Years , '' I should like to offer a slight contribution to what Professor
Campbell	PERSON	rightly calls `` the most interesting of the new bits of information '' that he has gleaned from the
Ellis-Allan Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The `` new bit '' is a bill for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's schooling in
London	LOCATION	.

		This document makes it clear that Poe
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 459 was not a pupil , as he himself averred , at the school of the Rev.
John Bransby	PERSON	-LRB- whom he erroneously called `` Doctor '' Bransby -RRB- in
Stoke	LOCATION	-
Newington	LOCATION	throughout his five years ' sojourn in
Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- 1815-1820 -RRB- ; but that part of the time , and previous to his Stoke-Newington days , he attended a school kept by the Misses Dubourg in
Sloane Street	ORGANIZATION	,
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		With the above data in hand , I set out on the quest of identifying the site of the school .

		The most obvious depository of such information proved fruitless , since the name of Dubourg does not appear in any of the
London	LOCATION	directories of the period .

		The second attempt was more successful .

		The
Town Clerk of Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	courteously permitted me to examine the Poor Rate Books , in which I found the name of
Francis Dubourg	PERSON	appearing for the first time in
Midsummer of 1816	DATE	.

		The date coin - cides with the date of the
Misses Dubourg	ORGANIZATION	's bill to
Allan	PERSON	for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's schooling , from which it may be inferred that
Poe	PERSON	's first quarter in the school was likewise the
first quarter	DATE	of the school itself .

		After the same number , 146 , under
Dubourg	ORGANIZATION	's name , is that of
Mary A. Brooke	PERSON	, from which it appears that two distinct tenants occupied the premises .

		It may be assumed that
Francis Dubourg	PERSON	was the father of the Misses Dubourg , and his presence simply adds another member , to those already mentioned by Professor
Campbell	PERSON	, of a family to be henceforth associated with
Poe	PERSON	.

		The street numbering has not been changed -LRB- the numbers run consecutively up one side and down the other -RRB- .

		No. 146 then is No. 146 still .

		It is the last house on the
East	LOCATION	side of
Sloane Street	ORGANIZATION	, on the corner of
Sloane Square	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present building , the ground floor of which is occupied by a branch of
Parrs Bank	ORGANIZATION	, is comparatively recent .

		The discovery that
Poe	PERSON	, when he was seven years old , attended a boarding school in Sloane Street greatly expands the boundaries of his
London	LOCATION	be - yond their previously accepted definition .

		It means not only that he lived in
Chelsea	LOCATION	, and that that Parish is to be added to
Bloomsbury	ORGANIZATION	and Stoke-Newington as constituting the scene of his English childhood , but it also means that , hardly less than the district between
Bloomsbury	ORGANIZATION	and Stoke-Newington , he must have frequently travelled over the part of town which lies between
Blooms	ORGANIZATION	- bury and
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		In other words , he must have known the aspect of Piccadilly and
Hyde Park	LOCATION	as well as of
Russell Square	ORGANIZATION	and
Newington Green	LOCATION	.

		SLIPSHOD BIBLIOGRAPHY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Not long ago , my attention was called to a recently-published volume by Mr.
Peter H. Gold	PERSON	- smith , entitled `` A Brief Bibliography of Books in English , Spanish , and Portuguese Relating to the Republics Commonly Called Latin American , with Comments . ''

		Being interested in those countries , I ordered the book for the assistance which I hoped it would give me .

		I must confess , however , that I am disappointed , and furthermore I can not see any reasonable excuse for the publication .

		Issued by one of our great American publishers , I felt con - fident that it would at least be a compilation of some value .

		No doubt publishers occasionally err , but why this book has been put forth is beyond my comprehension .

		Mr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	's name is unfamiliar to me ; though according to the title-page , he is Director of the
Pan-American Division of the American Association for International Conciliation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hold - ing such a position , I am confident that he has made a grievous error in thus appearing in print .

		My own interest is in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, and I therefore turned to that head in an index by countries and subjects .

		On page xvi I found one reference only , and that to a pamphlet published seven years since by the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	, 14 pages , octavo ; and the comment thereon is a cross refer - ence to a similar pamphlet on the Argentine Re - public .

		My hopes were dashed , therefore , as far as
Nicaragua	LOCATION	was concerned .

		I have a private collection of possibly one hundred titles on the Republic of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, from the time of its first coming under the notice of
Great Britain	LOCATION	until last year .

		Most of these books are in English , although two or three are in French and a like number in Spanish .

		Mr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` bibliography '' consists of 107 pages , and the whole number of titles included -LRB- 299 -RRB- is less than three times as many as I pos - sess on the single country of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	.

		I am curious to know the basis of the compiler 's selection .

		Surely there are sufficient books of first importance which might have been included , as for instance , the great work on
Mexico	LOCATION	by
Riva Palacio	PERSON	, 5 volumes .

		Is there any reasonable excuse for leaving out Waterton 's `` Wanderings , '' a classic of its kind , and Belt 's `` The Naturalist in Nic - aragua '' ?

		Fortunately ,
Bate	PERSON	's `` The Naturalist on the River Amazons '' does appear , but with a note insignificant as compared with the character of the volume .

		Only one title by Dr.
Nicholas Leon	PERSON	is included .

		Mr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	does not consider Mr.
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	's `` The Southland of
North America	LOCATION	'' as worthy of notice ; and his diatribe on what Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	saw and did in
Central America	LOCATION	is evidently written without any actual knowledge of the subject .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's book is not `` documented '' ; but there are so many titles throughout the volume , annotated by Mr.
Gold	PERSON	- smith , where this somewhat awkward word is used that it becomes tiresome .

		The compiler also seems fond of italicizing such words as '' General , '' `` Cap - tain , '' `` Don , '' etc. , for which he undoubtedly has a reason , though this reason does not readily appear to the uninformed .

		The compiler speaks of the scarcity of books in English on the
Latin	LOCATION	- American countries .

		Before making such a statement he should have consulted some of the collections in this country ; and he might have done well to have inquired for informa - tion of Mr.
P. Lee Phillips	PERSON	of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	, to whom he refers as `` A. Phillips '' on page x of his index .

		It seems to me that
Kingsborough	ORGANIZATION	's great work on
Mexico	LOCATION	receives too much attention .

		To be 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	sure , it was a labor of `` self-sacrifice '' and great `` human perseverance , '' and the plates and general make-up of the volumes are superb .

		But does not Mr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	know that this treatise has been to a great extent superseded by facsimiles of most of the important codices and other documents , made more accurate by modern photographic process ?

		I should also like to have seen included
Ward	ORGANIZATION	's book on
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		But the number of volumes not appearing is so considerable that I dare not even begin to enumerate them .

		The proof reading is bad throughout the volume .

May 3 , 1916	DATE	, A LETTER TO A DEAD AUTHOR .

		Dear Miss AUSTEN : Have you heard but prepare for something very dreadful .

		Amazing things are being said in this country about celebrated people .

		I can not think what causes it .

		It may be the desire for something `` new and novel , '' to use the expression of those venders of small articles we call `` agents . ''

		It began in the
East	LOCATION	.

		Somebody confessed in the public prints that he had never read
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some - one else announced that he had read
Carlyle	PERSON	, but thought him a great bore .

		The facile descent was begun .

		`` The Pilgrim 's Progress '' was next seen plunging down the vortex of unpopularity , along with the rest of the religious classics .

		I know your dislike of `` the vortex , '' but no other figure fits the case .

		Vortexes are quite common with us .

		Even school children are asking why they should be subjected to the strain of reading defunct authors .

		`` Our mothers , '' they say , `` read ` Gulli - ver 's Travels ' when they were children .

		It is out of date .

		Why , it was written before
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		We prefer something recent . ''

		This could be borne ; for to some a book is merely a commodity , like the season 's clothes , to be changed when later fashions appear .

		But such leanings are more serious in those to whom a good book is supposedly `` the precious life-blood of a master spirit . ''

		A few weeks ago a reviewer of the
Brontes	ORGANIZATION	' poems averred that their novels are old fashioned ; that they are more edited and discussed than read ; that , if read , it is merely because of the interest inspired by the tragic lives of the
Bronte	PERSON	family .

		These were `` the words , if not the very langwidges , '' of the review .

		A good deal was added about the melodrama of their plots , as if that were all their substance though if there is anything in literature more poignantly real than the school scenes in ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' I know not where it is .

		Is not
Scott	PERSON	's ``
Rob Roy	PERSON	'' melodramatic ; and are not
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Oliver Twist , '' `` Bleak House , '' `` Martin Chuzzlewit '' still more `` precipitous '' ?

		But I disgress .

		The worst is yet to come .

		THE DIAL , intelligencer and guide of those to whom literature is supreme , queried recently , apropos of a proposed celebration of your centennial year : `` Who reads one of her books once a year ? ''

		I am sorry to pain you , but so it was .

		`` Strange words they seem of slight and scorn , '' but perhaps , like
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Yarrovian jocular - ities , they veil an inward fealty .

		It may be con - soling to recall Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's compliment .

		It is related that when he visited Lyme he was impa - tient when historic spots were pointed out to him , saying with adorable warmth : `` Do n't talk to me of the
Duke of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	.

		I want to know the exact spot where
Louisa Musgrove	PERSON	fell . ''

		Unhappily , Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	himself may have disappeared from the literary firmament by this time .

		The next gale from the North may bring word that somebody in
New York	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	no longer peruses him .

		Out here in
Missouri	LOCATION	, we should be all unaware of his disappearance .

		We are so far from intellectual luminaries that , like some of the fixed stars , they could be snuffed out and we would yet continue to bask in their rays for some years to come .

		It would be .

		a great pity , however , for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	to suffer such a fate after all his labor .

		Your little
Catherine	PERSON	of `` Northanger Abbey '' may turn out a prophet after all .

		`` To be at so much trouble in filling volumes '' which , as she artlessly remarked , `` nobody would willingly look into , to be laboring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate , and I have often wondered at the person 's courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ''

		On the present fashion in literature , as well as in dress , I would fain discourse , but these are themes for abler pens that that of Your obliged and faithful ser * ,

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An editorial paragraph with the above heading , contained in your issue of
April 13	DATE	, has just come to my attention .

		It is an interesting statement , but unfortunately is not true .

		Evidently it is based on the misconception of some local newspaper a year and a half ago , which was given currency by Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	in his
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript '' column .

		The
Somerville	LOCATION	library 's exact statement of the matter , printed in the `` Library Journal , '' of course never caught up with the newspaper misconception .

		The fact simply is that the meeting between the boys on probation and the probation officer were arranged to be held in a small lecture room in the central library , so that the boys might be removed from the police court atmosphere .

		None of them are asked to take books , and most of them never enter any of the library book rooms ; so that the offender can not , of course , be `` made to draw from the library a book with a story bearing on the offence '' and `` subsequently called upon for proof that he has read the prescribed matter .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 461 THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF
CHARLES FRAXCIS ADAMS	PERSON	.

		*
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	was born in Bos - ton ,
May 27 , 1835	DATE	.

		He died in
Washington	LOCATION	,
March 20 , 1915	DATE	.

		The brief autobiography now published was written , in the main , in
1912	DATE	, though here and there are fragments of an earlier date .

		In so short a work it was impossible to render full account of the many activities of a very active life , and only the leading episodes are related .

		Even these receive no extended treatment ; they are , rather , but the pegs upon which are hung for inspection those characteristics and qualities that the writer felt were his , or felt he lacked .

		Thus the autobiography is an attempt at self - revelation ; only rarely is if a `` mirror of his times . ''

		This was indeed
Adams	PERSON	's con - ception of the proper function of autobiogra - phy , the self-expression , with truth and candor , of a man 's personality ; and to this conception he has held with admirable rigor throughout his book .

		Nevertheless , the bare bones of life must be presented , for understanding , and as such
Adams	PERSON	has given them .

		At thirteen he was sent to the
Boston Latin School	ORGANIZATION	, and his three years there he `` loathed '' then and in mem - ory .

		Placed under a private tutor , he entered
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, with advanced standing , as a sophomore in
1853	DATE	, another `` error , '' for had he entered as freshman , he would have been a member of the remarkable class of
' 57	DATE	.

		whereas the class of '56 `` was as a class dis - tinctly unnoticeable a low average ; and , in subsequent years , the chief distinction it achieved was contributing two inmates to the
State	ORGANIZATION	's prison . ''

		Yet the years at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	were profitable , for here
Adams	PERSON	began to exercise his `` aptitude '' for writing .

		In Sep - tember ,
1856	DATE	, he began the study of law in the office of
R. H. Dana	PERSON	, and was admitted to practice in
1858	DATE	, thereafter `` keeping his office , '' but finding few clients , and never con - tent with the profession .

		Visits to Washing - ton , where his father ,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, was now a member of the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives , and a tour of the
Middle West	LOCATION	in company with
Seward	PERSON	, in the campaign of
1860	DATE	, offered attractive opportunity to mix in the political whirlpool of that critical year .

Fort Independence	LOCATION	, and , after some heart searching as to duty , there followed enlistment in the volunteers , with appointment on
December 19 , 1861	DATE	, as First Lieutenant in the
First Massachusetts Cav	ORGANIZATION	- alry .

		Service in the army brought no especial distinction , though conscientious perform - ance of duties , here , as always , marked
Adams	PERSON	's career .

		He was first stationed in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, then in
Virginia	LOCATION	, took part in the battles of
Antietam	LOCATION	and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and was in many minor engagements .

		In
1864	DATE	appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	, a sense of duty to the regiment made him decline a staff appointment , though he eagerly desired it .

		At the head of his regiment he rode into the burning
Richmond	LOCATION	the day after
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	and his government had abandoned their capitpl .

		Made Brigadier-General , and the war concluded , he was mustered out of service in
1865	DATE	.

		Married in
1865	DATE	, to
Mary Ogden	PERSON	, a wedding trip in
Europe	LOCATION	was followed by a return , in
1866	DATE	, to his law office in
Boston	LOCATION	, but `` with a sinking heart . ''

		From the dreariness , to him , of the law , an escape was found in a return to writing .

		`` Instinctively recognizing my unfitness for the law , I fixed on the railroad system as the most developing force and largest field of the day , and determined to attach myself to it .

		I now stand amazed at my own inexperience and audacity . ''

		Yet within a fortnight after reaching this deter - mination ,
Adams	PERSON	had written for `` The North American Review '' an article on Railroads , thus entering a field of activity which was to engage a large portion of his energies for the next twenty-five years .

		`` Paraphrasing Pistol , the world was my oyster then , which I with pen did open ; and I did it , unaided . ''

		The fruition of these efforts came , in
1869	DATE	, with the publication of `` A Chapter of Erie . ''

		that classic in railway literature , and an appointment to the newly established
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts
Railroad Commission	ORGANIZATION	, the first of its kind , where
Adams	PERSON	served for the next ten years .

		In
1878	DATE	he became chairman of the
Government Directors of the Union Pacific	ORGANIZATION	; in
1882	DATE	, an Overseer of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, serving twenty-four years ; in
1882	DATE	, also , a director of the
Union Pacific	ORGANIZATION	itself , and in
1884	DATE	the President of the company , for which he performed great services in estab - lishing its financial credit , only to see his plans thwarted by the manipulations of
Jay Gould	PERSON	, who succeeded in
1890	DATE	in driving
Adams	PERSON	from office .

		In
1892	DATE	he was made head of the
Boston Park Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and was largely instrumental in saving the pres - 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	ent larger park systems from the maw of real estate speculators .

		In
1897	DATE	he became Chairman of the
Massachusetts Commission	ORGANIZATION	on the relation of street railways and munici - palities .

		In the meantime , private business ventures , with varying success and failure , had required much time and attention , and in general , says
Adams	PERSON	, `` the fallibility of my judgment has been noticeable . ''

		But one great accomplishment was his , the organi - zation , and direction for over forty years , of the
Kansas City Stock Yards Company	ORGANIZATION	, an enterprise which appealed to him as much for its benefit to the public as for its financial success .

		Thus enumerated in the pages of the auto - biography , though with but scant comment , the activities of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	seem sufficiently varied and pressing to have occupied to the full one man 's life .

		In reality , in addition to his historical study and writing , always engaging attention even in the midst of rail - way controversies ,
Adams	PERSON	has wholly omitted from description , or even reference , many other activities with which his name is insol - ubly connected , as `` anti-imperialism , '' or `` reform of the pensions . ''

		The autobiography is , then , no history of the man , or of his works .

		More than two-thirds of its pages are devoted , indeed , to but ten years of life .

		those from
1856	DATE	to
1866	DATE	.

		The book is rather a running exposition of the man , a bit of introspection , if you please , with all the charm of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's style as a writer , his amusing divagations , his vigorous denunciation of human fault or frailty , his wonderful ability in dramatic presentation of historical fact .

		The chapters , `` Law and Politics '' -LRB-
1856	DATE	-
1861	DATE	-RRB- , and ``
Washington	LOCATION	,
1861	DATE	, '' contain numerous interesting characterizations , or estimates , of men prominent in politics .

		Seward talked with his young friend of the great figures of the preceding generation ,
Webster	PERSON	, Clay , and
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Of the latter , he said :
Calhoun	PERSON	was the most eminent of the three , but they are all over-rated men ; for they converted the Senate-Chamber into a mere intellectual arena for their own struggles .


Calhoun	PERSON	had undirected , original eloquence ; Clay had a fiery , brilliant imagination ;
Webster	PERSON	, brute intellectual force .


Calhoun	PERSON	's logic was not sound ; he led and did not follow it , using it to support a pre-conceived theory .

		Of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	himself , although admitting the egotistical manner so offensive to many of his confreres ,
Adams	PERSON	presents a picture of the statesman in repose , less well known , and far more pleasing : Seward , in fact , never appeared so well as at home , in
Auburn	LOCATION	.

		He was there really and unaffectedly simple .

		He walked the streets exchanging greetings with every one ; and , as he sat at home in his office , every one came in without form or ceremony , and to everyone the same welcome was extended .

		It was , too , all genuine the relations were kindly , unaf - fected , neighborly .

		In the years immediately following upon the Civil War ,
Adams	PERSON	had a profound belief in the wisdom and skill of
Seward as Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Later historical investigation some - what modified that judgment , both as to the man and his statecraft .

		He writes : As I now see him ,
Seward	PERSON	was an able , a specious and adroit , and a very versatile man ; but he escaped being really great ... Perhaps my own impression could best be conveyed looking back on him now through the perspective of forty years by saying that he was an adroit politician and pseudo - statesman , having in him a dash of the philosopher .

		During his visit to
Washington	LOCATION	in the win - ter of 1860-61 ,
Adams	PERSON	met many men of prominence , and made a diary record -LRB- later destroyed in large part -RRB- of conversations .

		As a young man he had conceived a great ven - eration and affection for Sumner .

		Disillu - sionment came in this
Washington	LOCATION	visit .

		A diary record , previously printed , but here reprinted , tells of Sumner 's vague and dis - ordered language just previous to the inauguration of Lincoln .

		Adams was in con - versation with
Sumner	PERSON	and
Wilkinson	PERSON	of
Minnesota	LOCATION	: I had heard that he -LSB- Sumner -RSB- was excited , but his manner and language amazed me .

		He talked like a crazy man , orating , gesticulating , rolling out deep periods in theatrical , whispered tones , repeating himself , and doing everything but reason ... I soon saw that reason was out of the question , and the only course was for me to hold my tongue , letting him run down ... His attack was on
Seward	PERSON	and `` the compromisers '' ; he had thought of this matter in the day time , and lay awake over it whole nights ; it was all clear to him ; to him , his path was as clear as day ... he would reiterate : '' I am sure I am certain I see my way so clearly ; such a glorious victory was before us ; right was with us , God was with us our success was sure did we only hold firmly to our principles . ''

		.

		.

		It was very painful .

		The man talked so without reason , and almost without connection ; and yet he gave me dis - tinctly to understand that he alone could now guide affairs ; ... I was disgusted , shocked and mortified .

		Many historians have sought later to unravel
Sumner	PERSON	's `` clear path , '' but without certi - tude , for neither then nor after did Sumner formulate definitely his plan of action .

		Adams 's ability to hit hard in characteriza - tion , as well as his ineradicable determination to tell the truth as he saw it , is illustrated by his youthful diary citation on Sumner .

		Other illustrations are frequent in the autobiogra - phy .

		Of
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	, a leading secession - ist , he writes : I remember him at one of
Buchanan	PERSON	's receptions , a rather tall and lank Virginian , stalking about with a lady on each arm .

		In shabby black , of course , and ugly as a stone fence , with tallowy , close-shaven fea - tures , and prominent high cheek-bones , his eyes had
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 463 a hard , venomous look , while his flowing locks , brushed carefully behind his ears , fell well down over his coat collar , innocent of the shears .

		He was representative of a large class men who were just spoiling for a fight .

		They had it , too !

		, and , before they got through , had a belly-full !

		Yet here follows a later impression of Pryor , received in a chance meeting at a reception to
John Bigelow	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	,
1911	DATE	: He was then manifestly a very old man , softened by experience and domestic afflictions ... I recog - nized him , sitting on one of the front benches , the moment I came into the room ; and at once went and introduced myself to him .

		He was plainly gratified ; and so was I at seeing him there .

		On both sides , all the old feeling was gone .

		In the quieter rays of a setting sun , I like to think it was so .

		Adams 's anecdotal reminiscences , his gen - eralizations , a few of which have now been quoted , themselves indicate some of those per - sonal characteristics and qualities with which the autobiography intentionally concerns itself ; for , as before stated ,
Adams	PERSON	's theory of the purpose of autobiography was that it should be , primarily , an honest attempt at self-revelation , and honest in intent he always was , even , at times , painfully so , both to others and to himself .

		Not all qualities or all characteristics can be treated in a brief review , and one must be content with a few of those evidently most vital to the author himself .

		No comprehensive diary remains to show the man as he understood himself from day to day .

		Until volunteering in the army he had kept such a diary .

		Thirty years later he read it and destroyed it .

		The revelation of myself to myself was positively shocking .

		Then and there I was disillusioned .

		Up to that time and I was then about fifty - five I had indulged in the pleasing delusion that it was in me , under proper conditions of time , place , and occasion , to do , or be , something rather noticeable .

		I have never thought so since ... It was n't that the thing was bad or that my record was discreditable ; it was worse !

		It was silly .

		That it was crude , goes without saying .

		That I did n't mind !

		But I did blush and groan and swear , over its unmistakable immaturity and ineptitude , its conceit , its weakness and cant ... as I finished each volume , it went into the fire ; and I stood over it until the last leaf was ashes ... I have never felt the same about myself since .

		I now humbly thank fortune that I have almost got through life without making a con - spicuous ass of myself .

		Adams himself may thus scoff and condemn .

		No one who knew him , or his writings , would be likely to agree .

		The point of view is , how - ever , very characteristic of an honest self - depreciation , resulting , in spite of a bold front , in a genuine hesitation never wholly absent from a mind critically acute , and seek - ing that which was just and right .

		Boldness in word and deed is rightly connected with
Adams	PERSON	's reputation .

		But it was the ante - cedent perplexed hesitation and self-inquiry which left their mark in his memory .

		Such habit of hesitancy he attributed somewhat to the fact that in youth he was unfortunately always held a little apart from other boys .

		`` I should have been compelled to rough it with other boys . ''

		He was individualistic and needed `` attrition . ''

		This incertitude of mind and purpose was most marked in the months before
Adams	PERSON	volunteered in the army , and in those immediately following the end of army service .

		Even in age , the elation of a great decision made was as vivid to him as on that
October	DATE	day , in
1861	DATE	, when he cast aside `` scolding tenants , auditing bills , discussing repairs , rendering accounts , and so doing my duty !

		Psh !

		.

		.

		Even now , though more than fifty years have since passed on , I look back as at the moment of an inspiration the time when I resolved to burst the bonds , and to strike out into the light from the depth of the darkness .

		No wiser determina - tion did I ever reach . ''

		On return to civil life , the earlier dislike for the practice of law returned also , and it was not until he found a field of endeavor in railway matters that uncertainty was ended .

		How oppressive that uncertainty was , is shown in a letter written in
1869	DATE	to
E. R. Hoar	PERSON	on the occasion of the latter 's nomination for the Attorney - Generalship -LRB- Memoir of
Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar	ORGANIZATION	,
1911	DATE	, p. 194 -RRB- : `` Of all comforting things the most comforting must be to feel that one has a mission to perform , that all responsibility and doubt are gone , and that to retreat is impossible . ''

		Another obstacle to success and happiness alike , so
Adams	PERSON	believed , was his sense of a barrier in contact with men .

		He desired no such barrier , but , try as he would to break it down , there it stood , indestructible and insur - mountable .

		I was not popular in my college days ; nor , indeed , have I ever been so since ... I wanted to be ; but it was n't quite in me ... moreover , gauche , I was singularly lacking in what is known as tact .

		I had almost a faculty for doing or saying the wrong thing at any given time ; and I was painfully self - conscious .

		This made me shy ; and the world , as usual , set my shyness to the account of pride .

		This is keen self - analysis , but surely over - stated .

		Tact may have been lacking in youth ; only his contemporaries can testify as to that .

		But in later years , tact and consideration for others were his , distinctly .

		Shyness , `` set to the account of pride , '' was more lasting , and all the more a cause of discomfort to one whose real warmth of human sympathy needed an equal warmth of affection in return .

		Possibly it was this inability to find touch , that
Adams	PERSON	would have regarded as the principal characteristic debarring him 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	from the public service , had he given the mat - ter any consideration .

		The autobiography has nothing to say of this , nor did
Adams	PERSON	ever make any effort for political power .

		Nevertheless , the question inevitably arises , why a man of such distinguished political her - itage , with unquestioned intellectual gifts , with every quality , save possibly that of sup - pleness , fitting him to be a great public serv - ant , should have had no place in public life .

		The simpler , and presumably the correct , explanation is that he did not seek it .


John Adams	PERSON	did so , with intent and persistence .

		So , also , did
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		Still again ,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, the elder , from earliest youth looked forward to political usefulness , made his way through difficulties , led a `` forlorn hope , '' saw that hope become a reality , and was on the very threshold of distinguished success in leadership , when diverted to the diplomatic field -LRB- and a great public service thereby -RRB- by the offer of the English mission in
1861	DATE	.

		With equal mental abilities , abundantly evidenced in other fields , this man of the fourth generation did not gain the distinction in public service of his fore - bears .

		He did not seek .

		Had he followed the example of English political families , steadily pursuing , through years of appren - ticeship , opportunity in politics , there can be little doubt that distinction in that field would have been his also , and no doubt that the field would have been the better for his presence .

		In the autobiography there is little refer - ence to the political eminence of the family , and no direct evidence that
Adams	PERSON	ever desired public service for himself .

		In the concluding pages he writes : I have , perhaps , accomplished nothing considerable , compared with what my three immediate ancestors accomplished ; but , on the other hand , I have done some things better than they ever did ; and , what is more and most of all , I have had a much better time in life got more enjoyment out of it .

		In this respect I would not change with any of them .

		Yet the natural talent for public service was his .

		`` Statesmanship , politics in the largest sense , diplomacy , '' says Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	, `` were with him bred in the bone , were an instinct rather than an inborn tendency or inclina - tion . ''

		Whatever the greater personal happi - ness of life , the `` better time in life , '' it must at least be a matter of much public loss and regret that
Adams	PERSON	did not seek , and seek with persistence , opportunity in public service .

		The `` enjoyment of life , '' both physical and intellectual , was one of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's leading characteristics .

		This found expression in the living fire breathed into his writing , whether on current topics or in historical investiga - tion .

		The power of vigorous writing and dramatic presentation he calls his `` apti - tude , '' a sufficiently modest word to describe what others would name as genius .

		Prom the writing of his first magazine article -LRB- ``
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, ''
April , 1861	DATE	, `` The Reign of King Cotton '' -RRB- to his last year of life , the gift of the pen was a joy and solace .

		Literary work was carried on in the midst of business worries sufficient to prohibit most men from all other thought .

		On the day after he resigned the presidency of the
Union Pacific	LOCATION	, his name was advertised as the author of the two-volume memoir of
R. H. Dana	PERSON	.

		Historical investigation and writing espe - cially attracted him . ''

		For thirty years it has led me through pastures green and pleasant places . ''

		There is no need to recount , in detail , his product .

		In
1912	DATE	, he noted an array of ten bound volumes , and two volumes of occasional newspaper contributions .

		Since that date other volumes and many short articles have appeared .

		Not of equal merit , all are superior , and some are of unquestioned distinction .

		It has been noted that the autobiography does not offer a complete record of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's activities .

		Neither does it do justice to the man .

		It may indeed , for those who did not know him , leave a false impression , for , over - harsh in self-analysis , it dwells over-much on qualities in which
Adams	PERSON	thought himself lacking , with a severity of judgment in which his friends would not agree .

		This , however , was in itself characteristic .

		As Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	, in the
Memorial Address	ORGANIZATION	, puts it , he `` was essentially humble-minded as to him - self , and disposed to underestimate his own success and achievements . ''

		This may be an unusual , even a refreshing , note in autobi - ography .

		Yet here , it is not the real truth .

		Further , certain qualities , and those the most homely , do not appear at all , as his essen - tial gentleness and sympathy .

		Again quoting Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	, `` under a manner somewhat brusque , sometimes abrupt , was concealed one of the kindest , most affectionate hearts that ever beat , and how tender his sympathy could be those to whom it went out know well . ''

		Yet this self-restraint , even , in the desire to be just , this failure to be fair to self , serves to make clear that which was
Adams	PERSON	's great - est attribute both as man and writer , his absolute intellectual and moral integrity , so taken for granted by friend and foe alike that none was ever known to question it .


E. D. ADAMS	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 465 CROWDS A > - D CROWD-PSYCHOLOGY .

		* A book decidedly superior to the ordinary run of volumes following the striking but hasty generalizations of Tarde and Le Bon upon crowd psychology is Sir
Martin Con	PERSON	- way 's `` The Crowd in Peace and War . ''

		In the first place , its author does not write about the crowd from the restricted point of view which defines it as of two kinds , the Mob and the Public .

		In the second place , the theme of his book is that crowd organization is the mainspring of social progress , and his belief in the possibility of perfecting this organization saves him from the undue pessi - mism with which many regard crowd char - acteristics .

		Finally , his theories are arrived at inductively , and after laborious and cath - olic work in collecting data upon the behavior of crowds data which is objective , apposite , and full of interest .

		The crowd , as Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	sees it , is any aggregation of human individuals which realizes itself to have a distinct being and an internal unity .

		The
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	has a separate existence , rudimentary in organiza - tion and weak in life , but capable of mani - festing an amazing crowd life when attacked , as it has just shown .

		The nation is yet more vital and more highly organized , its crowd life being bound together by patriot - ism .

		Classes are likewise crowds , from the proletariat to the `` four hundred '' ; so are the professions : so are ecclesiastical and religious bodies .

		A disciplined regiment is the most highly organized crowd of all , the unit being merged in the whole , and its will lost in what we call esprit de corps .

		In general , the char - acteristic of a crowd is a pervading emotion - alism , which anneals and brings to a common level the rational faculties of the component individuals .

		It is for this reason that music opens and unites the hearts of men , and that in revival meetings a half hour of hymn sing - ing kneads the congregation into one body .

		An orator is the oldest and still the most powerful crowd-former .

		But there are hun - dreds of other agencies that can form a crowd newspapers , political theories , philan - thropic movements , philosophies , anything that breeds some common enthusiasm .

		The crowd has some of the virtues of high emo - tionalism sentiment and gallantry , for example ; but it has all the blind brutalities and other vices of a low order of intelligence .

		Three types of crowd leaders are distin - guished by Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	.

		the crowd - controller , the crowd-exponent , and the crowd - THE CROWD IN PEACE AND WAR .

		By
Sir Martin Conway	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		representative .

		The crowd-controllers , men like
Alexander	PERSON	,
Caesar	LOCATION	,
Charlemagne	LOCATION	,
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon .

		Disraeli , are those who can conceive far-reaching plans , and can fashion and mas - ter crowds big enough to give effect to these plans .

		The crowd-controller has an energy which compels him to project himself upon the crowd , to realize himself in its larger life , and to make it incorporate his brain as the centre of its brainless body .

		Among crowd - exponents are men like
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Lloyd	PERSON	-
George	PERSON	the visible and audible incarnation of popular tendencies .

		In treating crowd - exponents of lesser calibre than these men .

		Sir
Martin	PERSON	makes the forceful point that it is not the crowd that is caught by the dema - gogues , but the demagogues who are caught by the crowd .

		The crowd-representative is a picturesque figure-head rather than an indi - vidual force , a magistrate , a diplomat , an hereditary ruler , anyone typifying crowd sovereignty , but having in himself no special I power .

		Sir
Martin	PERSON	, in estimating the value of the crowd-compeller , justly remarks that `` that nation must always be the greatest in which the power of leadership is commonest , best acknowledged , and most employed . ''

		The crux of Sir
Martin	PERSON	's book appears in his chapters on the degree of organization of different crowds , and on the distinction between kingdoms and crowd-doms .

		The degrees of organization are to be measured by the elaborateness of the crowd 's constitu - tion , by its efficiency , and by the power to control the action of individuals which is conceded to the executive .

		The nature of its organization is healthy or unhealthy as it preserves a mean between the government in which an individual rules and in which unre - strained public opinion rules .

		between the kingdom and the crowd-dom .

		Kingship , Sir
Martin	PERSON	readily grants , is no longer an admis - sible form of government .

		It exists only in politically backward countries , where the pop - ulation is scattered , communication difficult , and the level of education low .

		But he pro- tests vigorously against a state of affairs in which only the crowd rules , in which the executive and legislative bodies are thoroughly amenable to public opinion , and no crowd - compeller is allowed to stand out against the rank and file .

		The statesman of larger vision , the expert , the man of rare force of person - ality , have their due places , for crowd-rule pure and simple must proceed by agitation and irrational passion .

		He points to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	conservative republics both as two national crowds whose governments have struck the golden mean between kingdoms and crowd-doms .

		466 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	Any movement to break down the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	or the power of the courts in this country Sir
Martin	PERSON	would completely condemn .

		In this treatment of the pure democracy ,
Sir Martin	LOCATION	is led into a distinctly one-sided , though still very searching and able , analysis .

		His scathing indictment of crowd-power con - tains some statements of an extreme sort .

		In order to estimate justly the worth of pure democratic rule , a sustained historical survey is not adequate , for our time is hardly like past times as regards the temper and intelli - gence of crowds .

		And in saying that crowds are `` utterly irrational '' and that all crowds are `` born fools , '' in alleging that the only feeling one crowd can have for another is hatred and opposition ,
Sir Martin	ORGANIZATION	confuses the frequent fact with the absolute fact .

		If this were unqualifiedly true , many democratic aspirations of reasonable sort would be a dream , and the world 's future one of per - petual war .

		The writer realizes the immense importance of the proper organization of the crowd ; he should also realize the immense hopefulness in the gradual rationalization of the crowd which is going on all around us .

		Not even in backward parts of the world is the crowd , in any sense of the term , so excit - able and blind as it once was .

		But it is clearly true that any one principle of gov - ernment can be carried to excess , and in that case will end in reaction .

		The remainder of Sir
Martin	PERSON	's book con - tains much that is interesting , but scarcely essential to the exposition of his central theme .

		He treats , and treats well , the distinction between morals and religion , morals being a social , religion an individual and personal , affair ; and points out that the essence of reli - gion is a thing appealing to men , not crowds , and that Christianity was taught to individ - uals by Christ but was socialized by
Paul	PERSON	.

		In holding that the civilization of peoples may be gauged by noticing the manners of its lowest classes , he is certainly wrong , as a comparison between the manners of the nomad Arab and the English navvy at once suggests .

		Certain other assertions are questionable , but they are apart from the main subject of what is , on the whole , an excellent treatise .

		ALLAN
NEVINS	PERSON	.

		An illustrated book on `` The Future of
South America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Roger W. Babson	PERSON	, is expected next month .

		The author has studied the economic problems and business possibilities of
South America	LOCATION	for years , and in the writing of various chapters has received the cooperation of several Presidents and other government officials .

		THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CIVILIZATION .

		* Among the contributions of American scholarship which have a high suggestive value the work of Dr.
Ellsworth Huntington	PERSON	must not be overlooked .

		For more than ten years he has been studying the effect of climate upon human character , and in three volumes and numerous articles he has brought together the results of investigations carried on in many places and under varied conditions .

		His latest volume is entitled '' Civilization and Climate , '' and it sums up such conclusions as he has been able to draw from existing data .

		It should not , however , be considered definitive , and its conclusions will doubtless be modified as some of his earlier ones have been .

		Without going too much into detail , we may say that Dr.
Huntington	PERSON	has made a study of the effect of climate , i.e. , temperature and humidity , upon mankind .

		He has amassed data concerning the physical reaction of workmen under varying conditions , and the mental reaction of students .

		He has also , on the advice of well-informed men from all over the globe , prepared maps showing the distribu - tion of civilization in the various continents , and a striking similarity is found between these maps and the maps showing the distri - bution of human energy on the basis of climate .

		Certain conditions of temperature , humidity , and cyclonic storms seem to favor physical and mental energy , which must have no small effect upon what we call civilization .

		One paragraph sums up the conclusions drawn from this miscellaneous data : In point of time , though not of presentation in this book , the first step was a study of the climate of the past .

		Ten years of work along this line have led to the hypothesis of pulsatory changes , and finally to the idea that the changes consist primarily of a shifting of the belt of storms .

		After this conclusion had been reached , a wholly independent investigation of the effect of present climatic conditions upon human activity led to two conclusions , neither of which was anticipated .

		One was that under proper conditions a relatively high temperature is not particularly harmful provided it does not go to undue extremes .

		The other was that changes of temperature from day to day are of great importance .

		On the basis of these two conclusions it at once became evident that the stimulating effect of climates in the same latitude and having the same kind of seasonal changes may be different .

		It also becomes clear that the distribu - tion of civilization at the present time closely resem - bles that of climatic energy .

		From this the next step is naturally back to our previous conclusion that changes of climate in the past have consisted largely of variations in the location of the storm belt .

		If this is so , evidently the amount of climatic stimulus must have varied correspondingly .

		Thus we are led to the final conclusion that , not only at present , but * CIVILIZATION AND CLIMATE .

		By
Ellsworth Huntington	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 467 also in the past , no nation has risen to the highest grade of civilization except in regions where the climatic stimulus is great .

		This statement sums up our entire hypothesis .

		It seems to be the inevitable result of the facts that are before us .

		Other explana - tions may indeed be offered , and modifications will certainly be necessary .

		Yet unless we have gone wholly astray , the surprising way in which independent lines of investigation dovetail into one another seems to indicate that a favorable climate is an essential condition of high civilization .

		In order to account for the decline of early centres of civilization it was necessary to show that some serious change of climate has oc - curred , and an interesting phase of this investigation was the study of climatic changes as indicated by the rings of Califor - nia redwood trees , up to three thousand years old , and by the shore lines of desert lakes .

		The suggestive value of Dr.
Huntington	PERSON	's work is great .

		If further data confirm his present theories , then we have a reasonable explanation of the decline of the ancient cul - ture centres , not only in the
Middle East	LOCATION	, but in Yucatan and the
Andes	LOCATION	.

		We have a sounder basis for interpreting the remark - able rise of
Japan	LOCATION	in the last century .

		We have an answer to the problems of `` White
Australia	LOCATION	, '' and in fact to all the problems of the white man in the tropics .

		We shall be able to define the `` ideal climate , '' and to take measures to avoid the ill effects of an unfavor - able one .

		And there is a material value in this research , as well .

		Our knowledge of the effect of both extreme humid - ity and extreme dryness is unfortunately still qualita - tive rather than quantitative .

		Some day , however , exact figures for all the various climatic elements will be obtainable , and we shall construct a map showing the actual efficiency to be expected in every part of the world .

		It will be so accurate that the manufac - turer , for example , who contemplates establishing a factory , will be able to determine the precise efficiency of labor in the different places which he has in mind , and can put the matter into dollars and cents for comparison with the cost of transportation , raw materials , and other factors .

		And if , as the present data indicate , certain seasons are favorable , and others unfavorable , for physical and mental work , then a read - justment of methods not only in our factories but in our schools and colleges should take place .

		The conclusions reached by Dr. Hunting - ton are so striking that the reader is likely to forget what the preface plainly states , that the work deals with but one of many cooperat - ing factors in the development of civilization .

		Other factors are `` race , religion , institutions , and the influence of men of genius , '' `` geo - graphical location , topography , soil , '' and other physical conditions .

		If each of these could be studied as scientifically , and with as broad a point of view , we would be well ad - vanced in our knowledge of how man has achieved and how future progress will be won .

		It is to be hoped that Dr.
Huntington	PERSON	may be able to continue his special work of investiga - tion , which in its magnitude really requires the cooperation of many observers , until his data become abundantly convincing .

		TYPES OF REALISM rx RECENT PLATS .

		* Excepting those who insist on a narrow and technical definition of realism , I suppose everyone would agree that the realistic play is the dominant type in recent drama .

		Defini - tion is risky business ; but I shall run no great risk in saying that I here use the term `` realistic '' in what I conceive to be its ordinary sense .

		By a realistic play I mean a play which presents characters at least momentarily plausible , in plausible situations , and speaking the language of everyday life .

		On this definition , a large majority of the grist of plays which come to the reviewer 's mill are realistic .

		Nevertheless , these plays differ widely in type , and some further dis - tinctions will be convenient .

		For purposes of classification , I have found useful a sort of scale , which I here offer for what it is worth .

		On the left , as in some legislative assemblies , I place the radicals , representing didacticism ; on the right , the conservatives , romance , farce , melodrama ; and in the centre realism .

		468 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	that is , tragedies may be didactic , realistic , or romantic ; comedies may be didactic , realistic , romantic , or farcical .

		The scheme carries with it a convenient subdivision of realism .

		In realism of the centre , the author aims to give pleasure through an absolutely truthful representation of life as he sees it , subject , of course , to the principles of dramatic com - position .

		Neither for the sake of enforcing a lesson nor for the sake of an effective situa - tion or stage '' point '' will he sacrifice his sense of truth .

		Realism of the left verges toward didacticism ; of the right , toward romance , farce , or melodrama .

		Of course the sharply drawn lines of such a scale are merely dia - grammatic ; a spectrum or scale of colors shading into each other would better repre - sent the reality .

		I recognize as clearly as anyone that no pigeon-hole plan can take the place of criticism ; but any simple scheme of classification may be a help to criticism .

		We have , then , three groups of realistic plays , to separate which it is impossible to draw hard and fast lines , yet which are in the main fairly distinct .

		Two plays recently published in the `` Drama League Series '' are excellent ex - amples of what I have called realism of the right .


Bernstein	PERSON	's `` The Thief '' sacrifices so much to situation that it might almost be classified as melodrama .

		The play has been acted frequently in this country , and an out - line is perhaps scarcely needed .

		It will be recalled that
Richard Voysin	PERSON	and his wife ,
Marie-Louise	PERSON	, are visiting at the country house of their friends , the
Lagardes	LOCATION	; that Mme.
Lagardes	PERSON	has missed sums of money from her secretary drawer , and that the detec - tive whom
M. Lagardes	PERSON	has brought down from the city has found strong evidence point - ing toward
Fernand	PERSON	, the host 's son , who is in love with
Marie-Louise	PERSON	.

		Act I ends with
Fernand	PERSON	's confession .

		In Act II ,
Richard Voysin	PERSON	and his wife have retired to their room , and
Richard	PERSON	discovers that his wife is the thief , and that
Fernand	PERSON	has assumed the guilt to shield her .

		Richard is furiously jeal - ous , though
Marie-Louise	PERSON	declares that she stole the money only to buy clothes to please him , and that she has given Fernand no encouragement .

		This act , which in the literal translation is rather indecent , was consider - ably modified in the American production .

		But up to this point the dramatist does not violently sacrifice character to situation .

		It is only in Act III that he throws reality to the winds .

		The Lagardes show no resentment at being robbed by a trusted friend ; and
Richard	PERSON	, at first convinced of his wife 's infidelity , suddenly and for no adequate rea - son , changes his mind and believes her faith - ful to him .

		He even leaves her alone to say goodbye to
Fernand	PERSON	, and the play ends weakly with a sentimental scene in which that youth promises his inamorata not to kill himself for I love of her .

		Even Act III is doubtless effect - ive on the stage , and the play as a whole is skilfully put together .

		But it is absurd to say , as Professor
Burton	PERSON	does in his intro - duction , that `` the author .

		.

		penetrates into the very heart of character .

		The psychology of
Marie-Louise	PERSON	is masterly . ''

		On the con - trary , the psychology of
Marie-Louise	PERSON	is largely determined by the exigencies of plot .

		Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	's `` A Woman 's Way '' is another example of the `` well-made play '' after the French model .

		In a prefatory note , the author expresses his contempt for `` so - called ` literary dramas , ' '' and warns the reader that `` this comedy acts much better than it reads . ''

		The mere reader looks for - ward with some apprehension of being bored ; but his fears are soon allayed .

		The play is ingeniously plotted ; and the dialogue , though it has by no means the brilliance of Wilde or
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, is at least superficially clever and read - able .

		`` A Woman 's Way '' verges on farce much as `` The Thief '' verges on melodrama , though it is throughout less real than `` The Thief . ''

		Except for the heroine , the charac - ters are the merest lay figures , and the heroine is all but impossible .

		The play is built on the ancient triangular foundation .


Marion Stanton	PERSON	, a young and pretty society woman , has become estranged from her husband , a nearly worthless rake ; but she still loves him , and determines to fight to keep him .

		Her rival is Mrs.
Blakemore	PERSON	, of the type `` irresist - ible to men , '' and -LRB- of course -RRB- a woman with a past .


Howard Stanton	PERSON	, however , is strangely blind to this fact .

		Matters are brought to a crisis by an automobile accident in which .

		Stanton and Mrs.
Blakemore	PERSON	are involved .

		Marion takes the offensive , and invites Mrs.
Blakemore	PERSON	to a dinner , inviting also several men and their wives .

		She has reason to believe that nearly all these men have had previous affairs with Mrs.
Blakemore	PERSON	.

		She invites also an old admirer of her own , whom she persuades to make love to her in order to make her husband jealous .

		The men sep - arately take the innocent
Stanton	PERSON	aside and call him to account for inviting their wives to meet their former mistress .

		By a good piece of acting ,
Marion	PERSON	bluffs the reporter who forces his way in to run down the facts as to the accident ; and so wins a decisive victory on all fronts .

		Throughout the play situation follows situation with almost bewil - dering rapidity , and there is a continual
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 469 crackle of repartee and local -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- hits in the dialogue .

		The reader who seeks ideas or living human character will be disap - pointed ; the reader who wants rather thoughtless amusement will be abundantly satisfied .

		Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	's `` Searchlights '' is a more serious piece of work than either of the plays just mentioned , but technically a much less skilful one .

		Its theme is the effect of the war on two families , one English , the other Ger man-English .

		The capitalist
Robert Blaine	PERSON	has for years lived at odds with his wife , and dislikes and distrusts his spendthrift son Harry .

		His friend Sir
Adalbert Schmalz	PERSON	is a naturalized and very patriotic Englishman , who has invested all his capital in
Germany	LOCATION	, and believes that
Germany	LOCATION	means peace .

		His loyalty to his adopted country , however , stands the test of war .

		Sir
Adalbert	PERSON	's daugh - ter Phoebe is in love with
Harry Blaine	PERSON	; and he rather likes her , and sees in her father 's wealth a guarantee of a comfortable life .

		Through the old device of resemblance to a photograph ,
Blaine	PERSON	is confirmed in believing what he had long suspected , that
Harry	PERSON	is the son of his wife 's former lover .

		He refuses to pay
Harry	PERSON	's debts unless his wife will give him legal ground for divorce by signing a statement that
Harry	PERSON	is not his son .

		The war comes , and
Harry	LOCATION	, after engaging him - self , debts and all , to
Phoebe	LOCATION	, goes to
France	LOCATION	with his regiment .

		He comes back after a sunstroke followed by typhoid , and is pro- nounced unfit to return to the trenches .

		To secure his happiness , his mother signs the hateful statement , and then seriously offers to commit suicide if her husband will destroy the document and promise never to reveal the fact to
Harry	LOCATION	.

		This is too much for the stony-hearted
Blaine	PERSON	, and he destroys the paper voluntarily .

		The outline indicates the theatrical character of the story , verging at times on melodrama .

		The plot is not sufficient in itself to hold the reader 's interest ; and the characters , with the possible exception of
Phoebe	LOCATION	, do not live .

		The same author 's '' Quinneys ' , '' based upon the novel of that name , was , I believe , written before `` Searchlights , '' though it has just now been published .

		It belongs in the same group of plays , but tends rather toward romance than toward melodrama .

		On the whole , it is a much stronger piece of work , containing one really memorable character ,
Quinney	PERSON	himself , and having a unity of tone which the later play lacks .


Posy Quinney	PERSON	, daughter of the irascdble and eccentric old dealer in antiques , bears rather a strong resemblance to
Phoebe Schmalz	PERSON	.

		She is in love with her father 's foreman ,
James Miggott	PERSON	, and sometimes after her parents have gone to bed meets him in her father 's `` sanctuary , '' where he has gath - ered a priceless collection .

		In Act I ,
Quinney	PERSON	discovers and reads
Posy	ORGANIZATION	's note to
James	PERSON	, making such an appointment .

		With his wife he spies upon the lovers , and shows himself at the psychological moment .

		Though Mrs.
Quinney	PERSON	turns against him , he is inexorable , and requires Posy to choose between him and her lover .

		His wife and daughter leave the house in anger , going with
James	PERSON	to some relatives .

		Even after he finds they are in earnest ,
Quinney	PERSON	will not yield ; and with great pertinacity and ingenuity he strives to break off the match .

		Of course he does not succeed ; but in the struggle his own best traits are revealed to his wife and daughter , and the play ends with reconciliation .

		Prob - ably it owes its success in about equal parts to the novel and attractive setting , to the character of
Quinney	PERSON	, and to the pretty and not altogether unreal love story .

		The changes from novel to play might be made the text for a little disquisition on the limitations which the taste of the theatre-going public imposes on the playwright .

		The love story must end happily ; therefore the character of the lover -LRB- who in the novel is a rascal -RRB- must be changed , and
Quinney	PERSON	must be proved wrong in his judgment of him .

		But there still remain in the play a number of indications that
Quinney	PERSON	was right .

		In the novel ,
Quin	PERSON	- ney has really been a party to a dishonest transaction , and
James	PERSON	really tries to black - mail him .

		Quinney shows the essential soundness of his character by risking ruin rather than give his daughter to a scoundrel , and
James	PERSON	is shown up and goes off in dis - grace .

		But this is a little too complex for the average audience ; if
Quinney	PERSON	has deviated from strict honesty in the slightest particular , he is in danger of losing their sympathy .

		Furthermore , it will not do for the play - wright to represent
James	PERSON	as actually trying to blackmail his employer , for
James	PERSON	is to win the heroine .

		Thus what is really the finest dramatic touch in the novel the searching test of
Quinney	PERSON	's manhood through
James	PERSON	's attack on him is sacrificed to the public demand for a love story with a happy ending .

		We turn to a group of plays representing what I have called realism of the left , plays containing a didactic element , in which the dramatist wishes to emphasize some thesis through a more or less realistic representation of life .

		Very obviously didactic is Mr.
Middle	PERSON	- ton 's latest one-act play , `` Criminals . ''

		The criminals are the highly respectable parents 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	who allow their daughter to marry in ignor - ance of the nature of the sex relation .

		They are sitting quietly at home in a reminiscent mood on the
evening	TIME	after their daughter 's wedding ; it appears that she and her husband are to spend the night at a hotel in the city before starting on their honeymoon .

		The telephone rings , and their son-in-law informs them that
Janet	PERSON	is on her way home , and that he is about to follow her .

		The girl appears , in a semi-hysterical condition .

		Before her husband 's arrival , she reproaches her parents bitterly for their neglect .

		On his appearance she locks herself in her room and refuses even to speak to him .

		The play ends thus , rather inconclusively , but with the suggestion that they did not all live happily ever afterward .

		Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	handles the difficult situation delicately ; perhaps if he had had a keener sense of humor he would not have handled it at all .

		He assures us that the play `` was founded on an actual occurrence , '' and that he has since heard of many similar experi - ences .

		But surely ignorance in this degree is exceptional ; and granting its occasional exist - ence , Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	takes it too seriously .

		Even complete ignorance could scarcely wreck a marriage without the help of other forces .

		Janet 's husband is a gentleman , willing to make every allowance for her ; and the reader does not despair of her ultimate happiness , though apparently the dramatist does .

		All the characters are the merest types ; the play illustrates the tendency of the didactic drama to turn away from the individual in charac - terization , and toward the typical .

		I hesitate somewhat to classify
Herr Franz Beyerlein	PERSON	's `` Taps '' -LRB- `` Zapfenstreich '' -RRB- in this group ; for although it is clearly anti- militarist in purpose and effect , the author nowhere allows his thesis to interfere with dramatic truth .

		The theme is the cruel injus - tice which results from the German military caste system .

		The author is an Austrian who probably for personal reasons chose to expose the German army instead of that of his own nation .

		The play was very successful in Ger - many , and the
Kaiser	PERSON	forbade officers and soldiers to attend it in uniform , which sug - gests that its blow at militarism went home .

		Yet personally all the officers in the story except one appear in an attractive light , and the exception himself seems the weak victim of a bad system rather than positively corrupt himself .

		The central characters are Sergeant - Major Volkhardt , a veteran of the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian `` War who is beloved by the whole regiment , his daughter Clara , and Lieutenant Von Lauffen .

		At the beginning of the play we learn that
Clara	LOCATION	is in love with
Von Lauffen	PERSON	, and is accustomed to visit him in his rooms after taps has sounded ; in a chance interview in her father 's office , she promises to visit her lover that night .

		Meantime
Helbig	PERSON	,
Clara	ORGANIZATION	's foster-brother , has returned from the riding-school where he has spent two years .

		He is in love with
Clara	LOCATION	, and was informally engaged to her before he went away .

		Clara receives him coldly , but makes him promise to say nothing of the change in her to her father .


Helbig	PERSON	's suspicion of
Von Lauffen	ORGANIZATION	is at once aroused ; and in Act II , soon after
Clara	ORGANIZATION	's arrival at
Von Lauffen	ORGANIZATION	's rooms , he knocks at the door .

		Von Lauffen sends her into the bedroom , hoping to get rid of
Helbig	LOCATION	; but the latter demands answers to his questions .

		Refusal to answer only con - firms his belief , and he insists on entering the bedroom .

		Though Von Lauffen strikes him with his sabre ,
Helbig	PERSON	succeeds in open - ing the door , and catches a glimpse of
Clara	LOCATION	.

		He is at once arrested at
Von Lauffen	ORGANIZATION	's order , and court-martialled for assaulting a superior officer .

		At the trial in Act III ,
Helbig	PERSON	admits his guilt , refusing to implicate Clara ; but the officers in charge are just and patient , and reluctant to condemn him .

		At last
Clara	LOCATION	herself gains admittance to the trial , and reveals the whole truth .

		Poor Volkhardt is restrained by main force from attacking Von Lauffen on the spot .

		In Act IV , he visits
Von Lauffen	ORGANIZATION	's chambers and demands satis - faction .

		The young lieutenant will neither marry the girl nor fight a non-commissioned officer .

		At the crisis
Clara	LOCATION	, who has followed her father , appears , and takes upon herself the whole blame of the affair .

		In a flash of anger the old man turns his revolver upon her and fires .

		Thus the play , without any direct attack , and adhering strictly to dra - matic truth , presents a striking and terrible indictment of the inhuman system with its iron lines of caste .

		The action is skilfully developed , and the characters , especially
Volk	PERSON	- hardt ,
Clara	LOCATION	, and
Von Lauffen	PERSON	, are strongly and vividly drawn .

		The play has been well translated .

		The difficulty of any exact classification of realistic plays is illustrated by the next two on our list .

		Neither can properly be called a play with a thesis ; neither advocates or even points the way to any particular reform ; yet each is intended to exemplify a central idea , a generalization in regard to human con - duct .

		Mr.
David Pinski	PERSON	's `` The Treasure '' is , the translator tells us , `` the first play of the modern Jewish theatre to be offered to an English reading audience . ''

		The nature of `` The Treasure '' is not such as to make us wish ardently for more of these Yiddish
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 471 plays .

		The dialogue is painstakingly realis - tic , to the point of dulness ; and in proportion to the action there is a great deal too much of it .

		The chief characters are the family of a Jewish grave-digger in a town within the Russian Pale .

		The life represented is sordid and unattractive ; yet the philosophy of the play is really hopeful .

		The central idea -LRB- emphasized by a sort of epilogue spoken by the dead -RRB- is that the desire for money is not altogether base , but is really a form of aspira - tion after greater freedom and a fuller life .

		Judke , the half-witted and epileptic son of the grave-digger Chone , discovers when he buries his dog a number of gold coins ; and bringing them home gives them to his sister
Tille	PERSON	, a girl who is starving for pleasure .

		She goes out and spends most of the money for fine clothes and gewgaws .

		The rumor of the treasure trove spreads rapidly , and
Chone	PERSON	and his family become at once the objects of atten - tion from marriage brokers , synagogue authorities , and representatives of Jewish charitable societies .

		The old people are driven nearly crazy by these visitations , and at last Chone tries to get rid of his new friends by telling them the exact truth .

		The result is that the whole Jewish community invades the cemetery , hoping to find the rest of the treasure .

		Judke at last remembers the place where the dog was buried , on the grave of a distinguished rabbi ; but further dig - ging results only in the mutilation of the rabbi 's corpse , and in the finding of four more golden coins .

		After the cemetery is deserted , the dead rise from the tombs to point the moral .

		As a detailed picture of the wretchedness of Jewish poverty within the Pale , the play has value .

		But its wordiness , endless repetition , and gray monotony of tone make it dull reading .

		A much better play is
M. Paul Hervieu	PERSON	's `` The Trail of the Torch , '' first produced in
1901	DATE	, and now translated for the `` Drama League Series . ''

		The theme is the willing self-sacrifice of the older generation to their children .

		The torch represents the joy of life , handed on by each generation to the next as in the festival of the torch race at
Athens	LOCATION	.

		Says the heroine to a friend in the first act , speaking of another friend : `` She has ceased to have any personal existence .

		Sne no longer cares to have anything of her own ; everything belongs to her daughter , and her husband works his fingers to the bone to pay for
Beatrice	ORGANIZATION	's dresses , while
Beatrice	PERSON	lords it over both of them in a way that is beginning to be just a trifle odious . ''

		Her friend replies : `` I 'm afraid I do n't agree with you ,
Madame	ORGANIZATION	.

		With naively natural beings like these , I enjoy watching the family wheels function with such simplicity .

		People of this kind conform to the law which begins by demanding of the mother .

		.

		often her beauty , her health , and if need be , her life , for the formation of her child .

		And then , for the profit of the newer generation ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	exerts herself to despoil the old .

		She exacts without stint from the parents .

		.

		all of their vital forces to equip , arm , and decorate their sons and daughters . ''

		The heroine , who is devoted to her mother as well as to her daugh - ter , stoutly combats this theory , but her own later conduct illustrates it .

		First she sac - rifices to her daughter the prospect of a happy marriage of her own , and for this her daughter afterward reproaches her .

		Later , compelled by an unusual combination of cir - cumstances to choose between risking her mother 's life and risking her daughter 's , she makes the inevitable choice , only to find after her mother 's death that she holds a distinctly second place in her daughter 's affections .

		The play is not only well constructed , indeed almost perfect in its logical plan , but thought - ful and suggestive .

		The characters are admirably drawn ; yet for some reason even the heroine does not evoke our keen sym - pathy .

		She lacks sympathetic imagination .

		This , of course , is her `` tragic weakness . ''

		and is so intended by the dramatist ; but it is not an amiable weakness , and this fact hurts the play .

		With less philosophical interest thaii these two plays , ``
Garside	PERSON	's Career '' makes a much stronger human appeal than either of them .

		It clearly belongs to the `` realism of the centre '' group ; it has no proposition to prove or illustrate , and its wholesome solid human - ity makes the surface cleverness of such a play as `` A Woman 's Way '' seem cheap and trashy enough .

		Though not a work of genius , it is an honest and intelligent study of live people .


Peter Garside	PERSON	is a young Socialist workman , who , encouraged by his mother and by his school-teacher sweetheart
Margaret Shawcross	PERSON	, works his way through college , apparently a rather rare achievement in
England	LOCATION	.

		He is a clever speaker , and against the advice of
Margaret	PERSON	, who knows his weakness , he accepts an invitation to stand for
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	as the Labor candidate .

		He is elected , and his head is turned by his success .

		He neglects his Parliamentary duties to make fiery speeches all over the kingdom .

		Having quarrelled with
Margaret	PERSON	, he falls in love with the daughter of a Tory manufacturer , who is amused and rather flattered by his attentions , and some - what impressed by his Napoleonic self-con - 472 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	fidence .

		His constituents find him out and force his resignation , and his career comes to a sudden end .

		In a most amusing scene ,
Margaret	PERSON	cures him of playing the martyred man of genius .

		All the characters are vigor - ously drawn , and the play has excellent acting qualities .

		Finally , we have to consider two plays by Mr.
St. John G. Ervine	PERSON	, which reach a higher level than any others discussed in this review .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	is by all odds the strongest of the `` new '' men who have published plays within the past year .

		Before ``
Jane Clegg	PERSON	, '' he had to his credit a couple of novels , a volume of short stories , and four Irish plays , which have just been published in this coun - try and will be noticed in a later review in THE DIAL .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	writes for the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	in
Dublin	LOCATION	, and it is natural to com - pare him first with the earlier successful play - wrights of that theatre .

		It is not too much to say that as a dramatist he easily surpasses them all .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is of course primarily a poet , not a dramatist .

		Synge at his best is superior to Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	in sheer imaginative power ; but a large part of his work is tainted with a kind of insanity , and he has nothing like Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	's firm grasp of reality .

		Lady
Gregory	PERSON	is often charming , but nearly always wordy ; all her best work is in the one-act form , and in comparison with Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	's it appears superficial .

		It is noteworthy that Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	has escaped or thrown off most of the mannerisms of the Irish school , and that he is not , like the others , narrowly national .

		The scene and characters of ``
Jane Clegg	PERSON	'' are English ; that of the other plays are
Northern Irish	LOCATION	.

		To find his match , we must turn to the real masters of the new English drama , to
Galsworthy	PERSON	and
Masefield	PERSON	.

		Both of Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	's plays are par excel - lence realism of the centre ; and both are tragedies of humble life .


Jane Clegg	PERSON	is a woman of strong character and intelligence , married to a weak , unfaithful , and dishonor - able man .

		She has two children ; and having received a small legacy from an aunt , is keep - ing the money for their education , though her husband ,
Henry	PERSON	, has tried in every way to wheedle or force her to give it up .

		Henry , a travelling man who earns good wages , is in trouble because of debt to a `` bookie , '' and because his kept mistress expects a child .

		He yields to a temptation thrown in his way by accident to appropriate a sum of money due to his employers , his intention being to run away with his mistress to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		But the theft is discovered too soon , and his wife undertakes to make good the loss .

		He tells her that he took the money to pay certain gambling and other debts .

		When she learns that the gambling debts are unpaid and the others fictitious , and that
Henry	PERSON	has been steadily unfaithful to her , she pays his debts and sends him away to his mistress .

		His character comes out admirably in his parting request to her , to take care of his old and irritable mother , who is certain to spend the rest of her life in blaming
Jane	PERSON	for
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's downfall .

		Such a sketch of the action can give little idea of the power in the play .


Jane Clegg	PERSON	, for all her sordid associations , is a tragic figure ; and
Henry	PERSON	and Mrs.
Clegg	PERSON	are portrayed with the keenest insight and with rare dramatic economy .

		``
John Ferguson	PERSON	, '' the later of the two plays , is the tragedy of a small farmer in
Ulster	LOCATION	, deeply and sincerely religious .

		In old age and sickness ,
John	PERSON	is threatened with eviction from his home through foreclosure of a mortgage held by the brutal and grasp - ing banker ,
Henry Witherow	PERSON	.

		He has writ - ten for help to his prosperous brother in
America	LOCATION	, but has received no reply .

		The only hope is that his daughter
Hannah	PERSON	may con - sent to marry
James Caesar	PERSON	, a middle-aged grocer who has been ill-treated by
Witherow	PERSON	and hates him .

		Caesar promises to pay off the mortgage if
Hannah	PERSON	will have him .

		To please her father she consents ; but soon finds that she can not endure the thought of the marriage .

		She is sent to
Witherow	PERSON	to inform him that the debt can not be paid .

		He violates her ; and the vengeance vainly threatened by her coward lover is carried out by her brother
Andrew	PERSON	.

		Meantime , the expected letter from
America	LOCATION	comes , with the money to pay off the mortgage .

		After a struggle first with his own conscience and then with his parents ,
Andrew	PERSON	gives himself up to justice , and Han - nah goes with him to give him comfort .

		The old people are left alone ,
John Ferguson	PERSON	with his profound faith unshaken , and read - ing in his sorrow the story of
David	PERSON	and Absalom .

		The central figure is always the patriarchal
John	PERSON	; his is the suffering and the faith of Job , without Job 's reward .

		His part is less tragic , in the strict sense of the word , than
Jane Clegg	PERSON	's , for he does not struggle , he only endures .

		And the charac -
ters %	PERCENT	re on the whole less sharply individu - alized than in the earlier play .

		Yet ``
John Ferguson	PERSON	'' makes a deeper appeal to the imagination , through its fine unity of tone , its noble simplicity , and its profound pathos .

		Never , I believe , have the tragedies of every - day life been presented in dramatic form more truthfully or more poignantly than in these plays .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 473 RECENT FICTIOX .

		* Imagination .

		I suppose , is the main thing in Mr. -
Jack London	PERSON	's work , the complete fill - ing out of an idea , the development of it .

		the application to every detail , the following out in every direction , and the whole held in mind securely enough for him to describe it and write it down .

		It does not seem to matter to him whether he is thinking about the relapse of civilization into barbarism , about the rein - carnation of a single soul in many forms , about the down-and-outs of the world , about a mutiny on board a tramp steamship , about prehistoric men and women , about how he used to drink , or indeed what it is .

		The main point is that if he thinks of it at all , he thinks it out .

		This , I should say .

		was imaginative , whether he happen to think of one thing or another .

		It is not really more imaginative to construct a new civilization than to recon - struct an old one .

		You must have materials and use them , but the manner of use seems to be the main thing .

		`` The Little Lady of the
Big House	ORGANIZATION	'' is , then , quite as imaginative a piece of work as `` The Star Rover '' or `` The Red Plague . ''

		and we can form a better judg - ment of it than we can of those works because i we have more idea of the circumstances , and therefore can get some notion of how well the imagination works .


Dick Forrest	PERSON	, with whom the book begins , is an example of absolutely perfect efficiency , the sort of man who has every gift and pos - session that can be imagined , who does every thing that any one can think of with the most absolute ease and simplicity because he has arranged beforehand exactly how he can do it easily and simply ; who lives , in fact , the mast wonderfully perfect life that can be thought of .

		He was a millionaire by inheri - tance , but early in life understood that it was best to have a wider experience than million - aires generally have , and therefore became a hobo for a time .

		He became an administra - tor ; but having broad tastes , he used his powers to manage a great estate with regard not only to the development of its material resources but also to the arranging of the social side in quite as effective a manner .

		do everything they undertake in the very best way .

		It is hard enough for anyone to imagine even that such a thing is possible .

		It appears to be easy for Mr.
London	LOCATION	to imagine not only that it is possible but exactly how it is possible .

		If he had such an estate himself , he could hardly be more detailed .

		He oblit - erates the old distinction between theory and practice , which rises from the fact that the theorist is generally too lazy to think out details or otherwise unable to do so .

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	is neither lazy nor unable .

		He delights in detail , and spends almost half the book in telling what happened in a day .

		All this is exciting and exhilarating at first , but in course of time -LRB- like all sorts of other things excellent in themselves -RRB- it becomes rather tedious .

		Hence , along in the after - noon Mr.
Evan Graham	PERSON	enters the story .

		His function and purpose may be imagined when we add that in all the efficient perfection of the
Big House	ORGANIZATION	there was one little rift which -LRB- one will perhaps guess -RRB- arises from the existence of the Little Lady in it .


Dick Forrest	PERSON	and his wife are devotedly attached : but it will probably be remarked at once that when Mrs.
Forrest	PERSON	comes from her own patio to her husband 's office at about eleven in the morning he pressed her closely to his side , `` kissed her , but with insistent fore-finger maintained his place in the pages of the pamphlet '' about hog-cholera .

		Perhaps it is not necessary to tell more of the book , or to explain further why it is not more interesting .

		For interesting it certainly is not , after the first few pages .

		Perhaps that is because it is not credible that a man who knows so much about running a stock-farm should be satisfied with anything but the stock-farm itself .

		If he is satisfied with writ - ing about , it , we feel that there must be something impracticable about his imagina - tion .

		If it will not work we do not believe in it .

		and if we do not believe in it -LRB- for the moment -RRB- we do not care for it .

		A sad but real paradox of the artistic life !

		An equally imposing work of the imagina - tion is Mr.
Harre	PERSON	's `` Behold the `` Woman ! ''

		Like Mr.
London	LOCATION	, Mr.
Harre	PERSON	gives us all the details ; where he gets them one can hardly conceive , but there they are .

		Whatever is in the book is there in immense detail .

		If there are purveyors of food , they have `` bread , millet cakes , cheeses , dried mutton , fruits , peaches ,
Shami	PERSON	apples .

		Sultani citrons , oranges , almonds , figs , and resin-covered skins of wine . ''

		If there are jewels in a coffer they are `` necklaces of rubies , emeralds , and peach - colored pearls ; wristbands and armhoops of 474 THE DIAL -LSB-

''

		When
Mary	PERSON	comes from her bath , her toilet assumes the char - acter of a dramatic panorama : she murmurs praises of her beauty while her negro slaves chant responsive rhapsodies ; she continues her rhythmical purlings while her slaves scrape her with a strigil and rub her with essence of saffron flowers and jasmine ; she sings her own charms while the black women paint her lips and her breasts , burnish her finger-nails , scent her body , and do other things .

		Every noun becomes a page , and every sentence a chapter .

		Mr.
Harre	PERSON	has taken for his subject one of the most remarkable things that happen , the passing of a soul from darkness to light , from insatiable desire to peace , from evil to good .

		But the remarkable element in this remark - able happening is -LRB- to my mind , at least -RRB- something that not only does not need elab - oration of a quantitative character but that will not endure it .

		One of the best known and most effective accounts of such a happen - ing is also one of the simplest , namely , that given in the seventh chapter of
Luke	ORGANIZATION	, to which Mr.
Harre	PERSON	alludes , the story of the woman that was a sinner and how she came to sin no more .

		It seems impossible that anyone who has read that account could imagine that it would be made more effective , or nearly as effective , by elaboration of detail .

		Such stories are often told by those who know most about them , namely , the persons who have themselves passed through the experience which is being told of .

		And it may often be noted that when such tellers make a mistake -LRB- and they often do -RRB- it is likely to be because they tell us too much of the evil from which they have been rescued , and more rarely by saying too much of the good that they have attained .

		Few are able to say much , and none too much , of the thing of most importance , the wonderful change itself which they feel has taken place within them .

		That is almost always a thing still wonderful to themselves , such that by no effort can they say much of anything about it .

		If we understand the little they can say , it is generally because we grasp by sympathy , perhaps by real fellow-feeling , what it is that they are trying to describe to us .

		For some such reason as this -LRB- if for no other -RRB- does Mr.
Harre	PERSON	seem to me to labor in vain in his elaboration of the circumstances of
Mary	PERSON	's life as a courtesan .

		Mr.
Harre	PERSON	feels that some who read his story will find what may seem shocking , brutal , wanton , and terrible ; and he points out that his book is not written for children , but for men , and the mothers and wives of men .

		Probably there is a good deal in the book which may shock even mothers and wives ; but that does not seem anything very exceptional in current fiction , and the only question that would arise in most minds is whether they are shocked to any good purpose .

		Frankly , I do not think they are .

		I can - not see any more good in the elaborate details of Mary 's life in
Alexandria	LOCATION	than in
M. Pierre Louys	PERSON	's earlier imaginations of the same thing , unless it be good to give such a con - fused notion of the whole thing that no one can really have any idea at all .

		Mr.
Harre	PERSON	is doubtless serious , and it is only right to meet him on his own ground .

		`` In Mary , the powerful Alexandrian courtesan , '' he writes , `` whose beauty in its day was truly the glory of
Egypt	LOCATION	, is represented the eternal struggle of womankind over man 's age-long injustice and exploitation , a struggle today finding its expression among those clear - visioned and valiant women who are demand - ing their right to equal place with men in the affairs of the nations . ''

		Had he not so written , I feel that few would have caught his idea .

		The actual impression of his book can - not be either of the eternal struggle of woman - kind or , as it seems to offer itself , of the eternal salvation of one woman , or of any - thing actually happening or ever having happened in the world .

		His detailed imag - ination meets the same fate as Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's .

		It lacks the touch of life , the only thing which makes us do the imagining ourselves .

		It is a relief to turn from such elaborated realism to the frank impossibilities of Mr.
Edgar Jepson	PERSON	's ``
Alice Devine	PERSON	. ''

		Indeed , it may not be an impossibility that
Lord Garthoyle	PERSON	, who had only five thousand pounds as an income , should inherit from his uncle twenty-five thousand pounds a year more on condition that he would act as his own agent in looking after the houses in Garthoyle Gar - dens .

		There seems no valid reason why such things should not be .

		And granted this fun - damental , everything becomes easy , and very much funnier than the normal mind would suppose it would be .

		Mr.
Jepson	PERSON	's imagina - tion is of a different kind from Mr.
London	LOCATION	's or Mr.
Harre	PERSON	's .

		Somehow , when you once
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 475 imagine an impossibility -LRB- I can not get it out of my head that the house-agent idea is impos - sible -RRB- you can suggest all kinds of things that are not only very possible but that seem quite probable , while if you begin on a real historic fact it seems as though every elab - oration became not only less suggestive but more impossible .

		Whether that is so or not , I read with equanimity and pleasure of
J. Quintus Scruton	PERSON	, gum-millionaire from
New Zealand	LOCATION	, who occupied No. 9 Garthoyle Gardens and paid no rent because he arranged that Mr.
Garthoyle	PERSON	should think his house haunted , and how the new house-agent visited the house and interviewed the ghost .

		Then the new house - agent , being this time Lord
Garthoyle	PERSON	in his automobile , fell in with half-a-dozen children and a young lady who was playing with them , and took them all for a ride in the country , where they disclosed the fact that they were anarchists while he talked with the young lady , who reminded him strangely of the ghost whom he had interviewed shortly before .

		And so on with the rest of the book .

		Perfectly absurd each adventure , of course , the strange marks on the house that were thought to be messages from more anarchists , the empty house full of snakes that at the proper moment came out of their basket and bit their wicked owner .

		Quite absurd , and fit only for the tired business man ; and yet on such a framework Mr.
Jepson	PERSON	manages to give more sense of actuality than in the piled - up and thorough-paced facts which we so often meet with elsewhere .

		I prefer another kind still , the story that comes so direct from a keen sense of the reality of something that it carries with it still the sense of an actuality that gives us for the time the illu - sion of dealing with real people and things , and leaves us with the same sort of impression that we really have from people and things .

		But such stories are rare just at present .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		Adjustment to life in past ages .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Amidst the present ringing on the anvils 6f material events and the daily readjustment of things , it becomes the part of wise people occasionally to turn to the past and the great leaders of the past , stopping the ears to the din of the present and trying to catch the fundamental chord of Eternity .

		This has been the purpose of Mr.
Henry Osborn Taylor	PERSON	in his recent book , `` Deliverance '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Out of a rich and fertile erudition , the author recalls `` those individuals who most clearly illustrate phases of human adjustment with life , its limitations , aspirations , and conceived determining powers , working within or from with - out . ''

		He remembers that `` the needs of men are not the same universally ; and the human adjust - ment may relate to conduct or to speculation , to distress at life 's chain of torment , or to fear of extinction ; it may relate to the impulse to specu - late and know , or to the need to be ' saved . ' ''

		The choice of these classic human adjusters is perforce somewhat conventional , but it is catholic in its breadth and wide in its sympathy and interpreta - tion .

		Beginning with the early gropings in
Chaldaea	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	, the author treats succinctly
China	LOCATION	's messages of duty and detachment from the mouths of Confucius and Lao-tsze ; the Indian solution by annihilation of individuality in the
Upanishads	LOCATION	and in the Paths of
Gotama	LOCATION	; the fiery militant adjustment to
Mazda	ORGANIZATION	by
Zarathushtra	PERSON	, the Prophet of
Iran	LOCATION	; the progressive revelations of the prophets of
Israel	LOCATION	in their efforts to adjust themselves to the growing conception of Yahweh , and especially the growth of individual conscience out of the earlier national conscience .

		-LRB- In
America	LOCATION	we shall need to reverse this latter process . -RRB-

		Then follow a charming account of the heroic adjustment by courage and fortitude as seen in the heroes of Homer , and a remarkably adequate discussion , for such brief compass , of the clear - eyed wisdom of the Greek philosophers .

		Thales , Anaximander ,
Anaximenes	LOCATION	,
Herach	PERSON	` tus ,
Democri	PERSON	- tus ,
Socrates	LOCATION	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and Aristotle pass before us in coherent glimpses , the adjustment rising in the last three to `` the sublimest satisfaction of con - summate intellectual appetition . ''

		Next comes the confused welter of the later Greece-Roman world , where Mithra and Osiris ,
Lucretius	PERSON	and the Stoics ,
Seneca	LOCATION	,
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	, and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	pave the way for what the author regards in some respects as the final adjustment , that of Jesus in establish - ing the filial relation between God and man .

		Fol - lowing this are clear presentations of
Paul and Augustine	PERSON	, in the latter especially the expediential adjustment of the
Early Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	in the Western World becoming evident .

		Here the author ends ; he does not attempt to follow the spirit of man in its complex strivings through the last millenium and a half .

		Indeed , in this little book of fewer than three hundred pages he has accomplished marvels in the way of com - pression .

		In general , the effect of the study is cumulative toward Christianity , which is presented as the final religious adjustment .

		Yet the very last word is , like the charactertistic religious utterances of our time , a question rather than an answer : `` Less rapturous , more analytic , tempers also may conclude that only infinite life is suited to eternity : not man , but God . ''

		Lord
Alfred Douglas	PERSON	once said publicly of Mr.
Robert H. Sherard	PERSON	: `` He writes books on Oscar Wilde .

		He is always writing books on Oscar Wilde .

		He does nothing else .

		It is , I believe , his sole source of income . ''

		This statement is quoted with amus - ing frankness by Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	in the foreword to his latest study of his favorite topic , the book 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	being entitled `` The Real Oscar Wilde '' -LRB- McKay -RRB- and serving as a supplement -LRB- of 431 pages -RRB- to his well-known biography of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	which was issued ten years ago .

		The two portly volumes together ought to satisfy almost any lover of the brilliant but ill-fated apostle of a3stheticism .

		Of course the `` real '' Wilde as portrayed in this sec - ond book can be no other than the writer 's admired friend whom the first work has already quite fully presented .

		Additional incidents and anecdotes are offered in abundance in the book 's twenty-six gen - erously illustrated chapters .

		We learn for instance , in illustration of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's talent for making enemies by his mordant sayings , that one of his most mis - chievous enemies was `` an actor whom he had criti - cised for appearing in a
New York	LOCATION	drawing-room wearing his gloves during an afternoon call . ''

		The author observes in another connection : `` In forty - six years from now the world wo n't be troubling about how a poet squabbled in the
last century	DATE	with the second son of an eighth marquess ; it will have other tremendous problems to face . ''

		Has it not even now too many such problems to afford much time for reading the details , minutely per - sonal in large part , so industriously brought together in this book ?

		Nevertheless , to
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	enthusiasts the work will strongly appeal .

		A Carlylean disciple on the war .

		An attack of giddiness or vertigo is likely to be the result of any attempt to plough through the pages of Mr.
Marshall Kelly	PERSON	's `` Carlyle and the War '' -LRB-
Open Court Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		`` The conclusion , '' says the author , `` will be written if at all , after the war is over . ''

		We beg him to forbear , unless in the interval , be it long or short , he has learned to use intelligible language .

		Imitating the styles of such authors as
Browning	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	has been a favor - ite form of amusement among writers with a taste for parody , and when offered in small doses this sort of thing is not without interest .

		But to have a book of considerable length written in a con - scious or unconscious imitation of the inimitable dialect of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is intolerable , and the more so in direct proportion to the reader 's reverence for that great nineteenth century prophet .

		How the author has succeeded in maintaining throughout the jump , the hop , the hiatus , and the limp that form this wild caricature of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's writing , passes an ordinary man 's comprehension .

		The result has been the spoiling of what might other - wise have been a useful book .

		The general point of view from which the author surveys the world - tragedy of to-day is one that requires emphasis among English-speaking peoples .

		Every reason - able thinker should be willing , whatever his natural pre-dispositions may be , to listen patiently to a frankly pro-German writer , and to make allowance for such explosive language as the due expression of sympathies may require .

		But when one 's liter - ary sense is nauseated at the very start by a jargon that is neither good Carlylese nor readable English the arguments of the writer are likely to be re - jected along with the disagreeable medium in which they are conveyed .

		Apart , however , from this almost insuperable obstacle to a full understanding of Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	's opinions , we venture to join issue ` with him in what we do seem to understand , his argument that because of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's devotion to German genius and German literature his general attitude towards the part that country has played from the day when
Belgium	LOCATION	was first outraged would have differed from that of the average Englishman of to-day .

		It is surely unnecessary to remind Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	that the
Germany	LOCATION	represented by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	,
Richter	PERSON	, and
Kant	PERSON	is not the
Germany	LOCATION	of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	,
Bern	LOCATION	- hardi , and the
Kaiser	PERSON	.

		In imagination we see the shade of Carlyle protesting in indignation against not only the caricaturing of his chosen medium of expression , but against the assumption that his love for those great souls who owed their birth to
Germany	LOCATION	must necessarily commit him to a blind support of that country , right or wrong .

		in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	^ n more than one masterpiece of lands of rhythm and romance for exam - ple ,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's `` Vers Ispahan '' -
Persia	LOCATION	and Turkestan are portrayed as regions of enchantment .

		Presumably on that account , and also because , even in these days of dauntless globe - trotting , very few Europeans or Americans ever penetrate to
Kashan	LOCATION	or
Samarkand	LOCATION	, the prevailing conception of these lands is somewhat rose-colored .

		At all events , a recent visitor , Mr.
Benjamin Burges Moore	PERSON	, gives in his book , `` From
Moscow	LOCATION	to the Persian Gulf '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a report which quite belies the current impression .

		The three - months ' journey whose events and gleanings are recorded in the volume led the author by sail from
Moscow	LOCATION	to
Tashkent	LOCATION	,
Samarkand	LOCATION	,
Merv	PERSON	, and
Askhabad	LOCATION	; thence by carriage and camel-train to
Mashad	LOCATION	,
Kashan	LOCATION	, and finally
Bushire	LOCATION	on the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	; and thence by boat to Mascat and
Karachi	LOCATION	on the Indian frontier .

		The record of the trip is set down in diary form , and from first to last it makes an interesting recital .

		There is forced upon the reader , however , the feeling that Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's view-point has been largely that of the vexed tour - ist , and that he has been more impressed by the lack of means of comfortable travel than by the ancient habits and the historic places that fell under his eye .

		It is true that he professes merely to have `` noted a traveller 's passing impressions as accurately as possible , not pretending to judge a historic race by the observation of a single visit . ''

		But the candid admission can hardly atone for the prevailing superficiality of view and for the deficient historic and artistic interest displayed throughout the book .

		The photographs in which the volume abounds are generally excellent .

		ism incurred in the war , Mr.
bhane Leslie	PERSON	, a brilliant young Irishman , an
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	graduate , has indulged in sundry reflections and reminiscences , which are offered in book form to the reading public .

		`` The End of a Chapter '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is thus entitled because its writer imagines himself to have `` wit - nessed the suicide of the civilization called
Chris	PERSON	-
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 tian and the travail of a new era to which no gods have been as yet rash enough to give their name . ''

		He briefly reviews his `` links with the | past , '' his descent from `` the Fighting Bishop , ''
John Leslie	PERSON	, through the tatter 's great-grandson 's grandson , Sir
John Leslie	PERSON	, also a militant charac - !

		ter ; he gives us glimpses of life at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and Cam - bridge , a short chapter on the Hanoverian dyn - \ asty , one on the religion of
England	LOCATION	, another on j English politicians , and a well-informed one on
Ireland	LOCATION	, the land of his birth ; and finally , after a glance at the good old
England	LOCATION	of sport and free - | dom , he pictures `` society in decay '' and the mani - j festations of a decadent `` post-Victorianism . ''

		The j call to arms he regards as a piece of good fortune .

		: `` In a moment of time all the troubles and worries !

		and threatenings of politics became ante-diluvian , j and the nation stepped down to do battle with | the cleansing flood ! ''

		He has certainly earned in | the smoke and heat of battle the right to glorify j war if he still thinks it glorious .

		The Southern attitude in the Civil War .

		On the fiftieth anniversary of the I downfall of the Confederacy there comes from the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	I Press `` The Creed of the Old South '' by Dr.
Basil j L. Gildersleeve	PERSON	, the loved and honored professor j of the classics in
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The little book contains two essays : one from which the book takes its title ; the other entitled `` A Southerner in the Peloponnesian War . ''

		The first essay was printed in `` The Atlantic Monthly '' in
1892	DATE	; the other one in the same periodical in
1897	DATE	.

		Dr.
Gildersleeve	PERSON	offers these essays not as a history of the Civil War or as an account of his I own experiences , but rather as an interpretation !

		of the feelings and actions of one Confederate soldier who , perhaps , was representative of many others .

		`` I am trying , '' he says , `` to make others understand , and to understand myself , what it was to accept with a whole heart the ' creed of the old south . ' ''

		The title essay undertakes to explain the
Southerner	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward the issues which resulted in the Civil War : the South was fighting for civil liberty , not to perpetuate human slavery ; j fighting for love of state a form of patriotism I closely allied to love of home and not incompatible with attachment to the
Union	LOCATION	; fighting against submission to encroachment which to them meant slavery .

		As to slavery , most of the Southern j people had no theory about it , though the aboli - tionist was looked upon rather as an enemy to j society than as a friend to the negro .

		Whether I opposed to or in favor of secession , the Confed - erate soldier went with a clear conscience into | the war .

		In the second essay Dr.
Gildersleeve	PERSON	, who went from teaching Greek to the
Confederate Army	ORGANIZATION	and back from Lee and Early to Aristophanes and Thucydides , traces the similarities of the two con - flicts .

		There were really no new issues in the Civil War , he thinks .

		Nearly all of them can be found in the Peloponnesian War , and many of them in every war ; the basis of each war lies in selfish hatred and much misunderstanding .

		Full of classical allusion and historical parallel , of ripe philosophy and sympathetic understanding , these essays by a scholar , teacher , and soldier form one of the best expositions of the Creed of the Old South .

		The latest evidence of this sort is a volume of `` Letters of Captain Engelbert Lutyens '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , edited by Sir
Lees Knowles	PERSON	.

		Captain
Lutyens	PERSON	was Orderly Officer at
Longwood	LOCATION	from
February 10 , 1820	DATE	, until three weeks before the death of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, which occurred
May 5 , 1821	DATE	.

		He lost his position on account of a dispute over
Coxe 's Life of Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough , which
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	presented to the library of the
20th Regiment	ORGANIZATION	, and which
Lowe	PERSON	ordered to be returned because it bore `` the Imperial name on the title page . ''

		The long strain upon
Lowe	PERSON	's temperament had evidently become too great , and his common sense had also given way .

		This affair was simply petty ; but it seems that
Lowe	PERSON	required
Lutyens	PERSON	to obtain ocular evidence every day of
Napoleon	PERSON	's presence even if it became necessary to force his way into the sickroom .

		It is to the officer 's credit that he disliked the task of `` peep - ing . ''

		Captain
Lutyens	PERSON	's letters contain little beyond the reports that
Napoleon	PERSON	was seen here or there about
Longwood	LOCATION	.

		In one of the appen - dices are letters from a young English sergeant to his mother explaining how the dead emperor looked and what impressions the spectacle of fallen great - ness made upon him .

		The make-up of the volume will enhance its value to collectors of Napoleonic material .

		The illustrations are remarkable for the skill and beauty with which miniatures and colored prints are reproduced .

		The view of
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	from the sea is especially noteworthy .

		Discriminating readers have often observed that the bulk of recent works on
South America	LOCATION	tend to fall into two classes : either they are the books of dis - tinguished visitors who , travelling in a more or less official capacity , have been taken in hand by the various governments , royally entertained , and shown only such things ` as these governments wish to be seen ; or else they merely embody a mass of superficial observations made during a flying visit .

		In `` The Real Argentine '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	has contrived to avoid both these extremes .

		A lengthy sojourn in
Argentina	LOCATION	, without any hampering official connections , afforded him an opportunity for an impartial and open-minded study of the country and its people .

		The picture which he draws of
Argentina	LOCATION	, particu - larly
Buenos Aires	ORGANIZATION	, is far from flattering .

		In his desire to give an unvarnished and accurate account of what he saw , he lays the colors on too darkly .

		His first impressions of the capital are distinctly unfavorable .

		He has much to say about the nar - row and crowded streets , the incivility of the Argentines , the exorbitant cost of living , and par - ticularly the tawdry and unstable character of the 478 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 11	DATE	public buildings .

		Buenos Aires is in his judgment merely u a magnificent city of shams , '' a sort of grotesque replica of
Paris	LOCATION	in which stucco takes the place of marble and plaster that of granite .

		On every hand he finds evidence of a sordid spirit of utilitarianism which leaves little opportunity for the cultivation of the finer side of life .

		To be sure , a longer sojourn in the country has led the author to revise somewhat these first impressions .

		By dint of searching he finds evidence that there is a reaching out for better things .

		`` Alongside the sheer brutality , unhappily still existing , the tender plant of intellectual culture has been grow - ing , and with it true humanitarianism must make progress . ''

		But the reader searches in vain in this volume for a satisfactory interpretation of those spiritual and cultural forces which are slowly bringing
Argentina	LOCATION	into the vanguard of great nations .

		This over-emphasis on the somewhat seamy side of the material development of the country is the chief defect of this cleverly written and entertaining book .

		With this belated suggestion of an appropriate sobriquet , we turn to a brief consideration of his latest biography , entitled `` Delane of The Times , '' by Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	.

		It must be by a sort of poetic justice that to the British Censor-in-Chief falls the task of writing the life of one who notoriously defied all censorship .

		The book , compactly inclusive of the main facts as already presented in Mr.

		Periodical articles about our best - known magazines , about writing for the magazines , and on other kindred subjects , furnish the greater number of entries , with occasional references to books .

		The term `` magazine '' is made so inclusive as to embrace other than monthly publications , as for instance `` The Nation '' and THE DIAL .

		Ex - haustiveness is not claimed for this modest bibliography , but it is a useful work in a field comparatively uncultivated by the bibliographer .

		Though announced on its wrapper as `` a new book by
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, '' the short treatise `` On Being Human '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- was in fact published nineteen years ago in `` The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	. ''

		It is , however , new in book form , and so the pres - ent publisher 's assertion is in a literal sense true .

		The essay is worthy of its more permanent shape , for at any time it serves as a useful reminder that `` to be human is , for one thing , to speak and act with a certain note of genuineness , a quality mixed of spontaneity and intelligence .

		This is necessary for wholesome life in any age , but particularly amidst confused affairs and shifting standards . ''

		Even more now than on its original appearance are the calm , wise counsels of the brief treatise needed by the public whom the author addresses .

		The general purpose and scope of Dr.
Liberty H. Bailey	PERSON	's `` Standard Cyclopedia of Horticul - ture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were stated fully in connection with the appearance of the first volume -LRB- see THE DIAL of
August 16 , 1914	DATE	-RRB- .

		Volume IV has now appeared , and two more volumes will complete this important work .

		The new volume begins with `` Labels '' and ends with `` Oxytropis . ''

		As usual , each important subject is presented by some specialist .

		In addition to the plant descriptions and accounts of cultural methods , the more exten - sive general articles are those dealing with land - scape gardening , light , machinery , marketing , nomenclature , horticulture in North American states , nut culture , orange culture , and orchid culture .

		The colored plates of the volume are especially attractive .

		The sixteen miscellaneous pieces , chiefly literary and critical , brought together in Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's '' Reticence in Literature , and Other Papers '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- furnish much good reading on subjects of more than transient interest .

		They are described by the author as '' covering twenty-five years of journalistic ' dust and desk-work , ' '' and they treat of reticence in writing , as the title in - dicates , of the abuse of the superlative , nineteenth - century fiction , some movements in Victorian poetry , the mood and the book , anthologies , a
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 479 number of English poets and prose-writers , chiefly of the
last century	DATE	, and a few other subjects .

		In asserting that '' reticence is not a national char - acteristic far otherwise , '' the author invites contradiction .

		In the expression of emotion the Englishman has the reputation , deservedly , of being commendably reticent , which is not incom - patible with honesty and frankness , qualities that Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	ascribes to his fellow-countrymen . ''

		The Englishman has always prided himself upon his frankness , '' he declares .

		Both the enthusiasm of youth and the calm judgment of maturer years are exemplified in
this quarter-century	DATE	's harvest of a literary critic 's occasional productions .

		In `` The Masterpieces of Modern Drama '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , edited by Mr.
John Alexander Pierce	PERSON	under the supervision of Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, are contained some of the best modern plays English ,
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, and American , abridged in narrative form with textual repro - duction of the great scenes .

		In the Introduction to the two volumes , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	refers to this editorial plan as `` an ingenious and enticing compromise between the unadorned dialogue of the stage play and the unbroken narrative of prose - fiction . ''

		Some readers may agree with him .

		Others will feel that they are missing half the fun by accepting an abridged version of `` The Impor - tance of Being Earnest '' and `` You Never Can Tell , '' or that they would take a long chance on trusting their own intelligence , without editor 's exposition and comment , in reading and fully understanding a play like `` The Return of
Peter Grimm	PERSON	. ''

		Professor
Tucker Brooke	PERSON	's edition of `` Common Conditions , '' from the recently discovered quarto owned by the
Elizabethan Club of Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , is something of a `` scoop '' in the field of Middle English literature .

		Hitherto only the
Chatsworth	LOCATION	copy was thought to be extant .

		The new text is of an earlier edition , is less of a frag - ment , and revolutionizes completely prior impres - sions of the play by overthrowing the conventional happy ending which has been hitherto assumed .

		The editor whimsically suggests that we may have to wait another three hundred years before we really know if
Lamphedon	PERSON	died of the poison or if Clarisia quaffed the cup .

		But what are three hundred years in the world of scholarship ?

		In his treatment of the new text , in the comparative stud -RCB- - of the two manuscripts , in the Introduc - tion and the carefully prepared appendixes and notes , Professor
Brooke	PERSON	throughout reveals the true scholar 's enthusiasm and love for his task .

		-LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		In commemoration of the life and work of
Francis Asbury	PERSON	, first bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, sent hither by Wesley in
1771	DATE	, there appears in this centennial year of
Asbury	ORGANIZATION	's death a well-written volume about him , ``
Francis Asbury	PERSON	, the Prophet of the Long Road '' -LRB- Methodist Book Concern -RRB- .

		It is rather an esti - mate of the man , as is explained by the author , Mr.
Ezra Squier Tipple	PERSON	, than an addition to the already numerous biographies of him .

		In his con - cluding summary the author compares and con - trasts
Asbury	ORGANIZATION	with
Lord Kitchener	PERSON	, finding that `` just as
Kitchener	LOCATION	in an hour of crisis has seemed to be ` the living expression of the Will of the entire British Empire , ' so
Francis Asbury	PERSON	to his age was the
Will of Jehovah	ORGANIZATION	and the heavenly hosts . ''

		Mr.
Tipple	PERSON	shows a thorough knowledge of his subject , his previous work in editing selec - tions from
Asbury	ORGANIZATION	's journal having helped to prepare him for this more ambitious undertaking .

		Illustrations and facsimiles add no little to the interest of the book .

		A line of type or two , or three at the most , is the space allotted to each name that appears in `` A Dictionary of Universal Biography of All Ages and All Peoples '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , prepared by Mr.
Albert M. Hyamson	PERSON	.

		The scope of the work is outlined in the Preface : `` It is a guide to the biographies of , it may be said without exaggera - tion , every man or woman , not still alive , who has achieved eminence or prominence , from the dawn of history until this day -LSB-
October 1 , 1915	DATE	-RSB- in the
twentieth century	DATE	on which this preface is being written .

		The work covers all countries and all generations .

		An endeavor has been made to include every one whose work or whose memory can be said to have survived until to-day , in the scheme of the undertaking . ''

		Many who use the volume will look in vain for at least one who by his work and memory merits inclusion , but this would be true of practically every similar compilation in existence .

		Words are successfully substituted for sentences , a few self-explanatory abbreviations are used , and the size of the volume is excellently adapted to general desk use .

		To have brought so much information within so comparatively narrow a compass is an achievement little short of extraordinary .

		A volume which might well be taken for a model in its kind is the catalogue of `` Greek , Etruscan , and Roman Bronzes in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , '' prepared by Dr.
Gisela M. A. Richter	PERSON	, assistant curator of the
Museum	ORGANIZATION	's classical sec - tion .

		It is quarto in form , beautifully printed by the
Gillis	PERSON	Press of
New York	LOCATION	, and lavishly illus - trated with fine half-tone reproductions of the treasures dealt with in the text .

		The technical processes of bronze-working in antiquity , and the origin of the ancient patina , are discussed at length in an Introduction ; while the body of the work consists of concise descriptions of all the important objects in the
Museum	ORGANIZATION	's collection .

		A selected bibliography and an index , both prepared with excellent judgment , are included .

		The col - lection in the Metropolitan Museum began in 1872-6 , when the objects discovered in
Cyprus	LOCATION	by
General di Cesnola	ORGANIZATION	were purchased .

		Twenty years later the
Baxter	PERSON	and
Frothingham	PERSON	collections were bought , and the late
Henry G. Marquand	PERSON	gave twenty bronzes of exceptional importance .

		In
1903	DATE	the Museum authorities bought the famous chariot from
Monteleone	PERSON	; and from
1906	DATE	onwards they have every year made one or more first-rate acquisitions .

		The beautiful catalogue now pub - lished is a worthy cicerone and memorial to one of the finest collections of art objects in the world .

		Among library publications of monthly or quar - terly periodicity , appreciative mention should be made of such book-bulletins as that of the Provi - dence , the Grand Rapids , the

		A proper viewpoint is everything in life , for it enables us to seek out the law and comply with it .

		This book attempts to give that answer and to point out the way as well .

		It tells of health , happiness and salva - tion to be attained now , not in some distant , uncer - tain future .

		A list of the books reviewed or mentioned in this issue of THE DIAL will be found on page 515 .

		In trying to straighten out my own rather vague ideas about realism , the other day , I stumbled on a discovery .

		It was n't anything new to human thought , I suppose , but it was new to me the feeling me , if not the think - ing one .

		It was simply the discovery that the important and sensible thing I ought to be about was not contrasting realism and romance , but contrasting true realism and false realism , true romance and false romance .

		I seemed to see for the first time that there is about as much sense in putting realism and romance in the scales together as in balancing a side of beef against a bale of eiderdown No question of competitive merit is really involved .

		One commodity may be more important than the other , but you can not fairly say that one is more legitimate than the other , or that one can take the place of the other .

		So I came to the comforting and perhaps obvious conclusion that we need them both in our business of living , the interpre - tation of character in action which is true realism , and the high illusion which is true romance .

		When realism has suitably embod - ied life , do we not still need romance to give it glamour ?

		Now glamour is most readily to be achieved by appeal to the remote , in time or place or both .

		You may , it is true , have a treasure buried in your woodshed , or a secret cup - board bricked into your chimney .

		But the past with its quaintness is a safe and inex - haustible background .

		In the lost land of costume , at least , it is possible for all absurd , desirable things to befall .

		Next-Door Jones may have had strikingly romantic adventures on his way to his office , but he finds difficulty in investing them with glamour : he does n't look or sound the part .

		Creased trousers and a pot hat may be the current uniform , the accepted livery of our service to the world of fact and every-day .

		But it is a good deal easier to make a credible hero of Jones by throwing him back a century or two rig - ging him out with doublet and hose , or glaive and morion , or queue and knee-breeches , or 492 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	even stock and gaiters .

		In pursuit of romance the costume novel , like the costume play , quite naturally and legitimately follows the line of least resistance .

		A good many years ago I went to see an excellent company in `` She Stoops to Conquer . ''

		The
Marlow	PERSON	pleased me particularly , a graceful fellow , master of his limbs and his sword and his ruffles and his lines , the
Marlow	PERSON	of my dreams .

		The next night I was to see the same company in a modern play , and I looked forward with not a little confidence to my
Marlow	PERSON	man in his new role .

		Alas , he was a pitiable object , his fine calves wasted in their clumsy modern swathings , his manner finicking and ineffective , his action even clumsy .

		I got the impression of a man ham - pered and embarrassed ,
Marlow	PERSON	awkwardly disguised as Next-Door Jones .

		The truth is , that young actor needed the grace of costume and accent to set him at ease , to release his spirit from the bondage of yesterday 's tailor land to-day 's haberdasher , and to give it the freedom of the city of romance .

		I think the great romancers have most of them been like that
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, for example , or , for a current instance , Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	.

		They have dealt most successfully with the past because it was only with the aid of the past that they could capture their glamorous vision , achieve their fine illusion .

		Kealism shows us what we are and what we mean ; but it is romance which gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name .

		Of all airy nothings , perhaps the most reprehensible and the most engaging is the spirit of the gamble .

		In sober moods we agree that for the most part , in the fortunes of this world , men reap what they sow , get `` what is coming to them . ''

		But as natural men , as those children of larger growth for whom romance prepares its cheering potion , we do not cherish the admission .

		We prefer to stow it away , among various uneasy doctrines , in the wooden bosom of that handy repository , Man .

		It is just the kind of thing to keep in that kind of place .

		We can take it out now and then , and look it over and say how well preserved it is , and put it back with perfect confidence that it will stay put till called for .

		Murder will out , and man is the contriver of his own fortunes , and figs can - not be gathered from thistles or pears from an elm-tree .

		But the wind bloweth where it listeth , it 's an ill wind that blows nobody good , and the rain descends upon the unjust as well as the just .

		A less salutary form of truth , this latter , but it is only Man who can be always thinking of his health : He has no palate .

		`` Happiness '' means good luck ; and the natural man is content to have it so .

		When he parts with you he does not ask heaven to bless you according to your deserts ; he wishes you luck .

		He would not give over - much for life without its savor of chance .

		Unless she offers him fortune , religion her - self is a dingy business .

		Take away his miracle , and you leave him with a mess of theories , too plain a dish for him to relish , though he may contrive to swal - low it .

		One miracle he never tires of : that miracle which , we are told , may happen to any of us .

		Morally , men make their own beds and must lie upon them .

		But the natural man believes , or longs to believe , in a power capable of lifting him heavenwards , bed and all , like the man in Holy Writ .

		The Reverend
Billy Sunday	PERSON	knows what he has to reckon with when he calls his thousands to repent - ance and a place under the spotlight .

		The TTOV o-To -RRB- of all
Reverend Billies	PERSON	is their ground of converted sinner .

		How thrilling to hear what a reprobate the prophet was before the wonderful unexpected thing hap - pened !

		Conversion stupendous bit of luck windfall of almighty grace !

		Salvation a bonus , a prize , a sublime fluke , the thing men covet most and longest something for nothing !

		No faith based on this cheerful arti - cle can be lacking in romance : what else was it that gave fatness to the lean religion of the New Englander or the Scot ?

		But art ?

		Well , of course the graver art , the art of interpretation , busies itself , not with windfalls and sudden transformations , but with an orderly development of character and action .

		But the art of romance , of illu - sion , of diversion from reality , has no such business .

		Shakespeare knew that by summar - ily converting his two wicked brothers in
Arden	LOCATION	, he would not be making them absurd , he would be investing them with a special kind of charm .

		Romance at least is honest she makes no bones of her dependence on the fluke .

		You may joke her on her free use of chance , the long arm of coincidence , or what not .

		She knows better than to be laughed out of it .

		What would you give her instead ?

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 493 the short thumb of probability , with its neat and dull little rules ?

		Heaven forbid !

		If we are to get nothing better than a row of orderly occurrences , spare us your pains , well-meaning story-teller .

		Character ?

		It 's neither here nor there , though of course if you want to try to make us believe in your people , go ahead .

		Action ?

		By all means , if you do n't mean by that mere logical events .

		What we want is incidents , happenings : let things befall , do n't bore us with outcomes .

		Things are eventuating all about us , and we 're tired of them .

		Give us adventure , the fortune Chance fetches , the thing -LRB- see dic - tionary -RRB- that is coming to us .

		An honest romancer has this plea always in his ears .

		It gives him no uneasiness .

		He knows we are not demanding prodigies of him .

		The cruder appetite for a thrill on every page he can afford to ignore , the more generous craving he can not and need not .

		It is a vicarious business .

		We ask him to treat his own people handsomely in the long run ; that being understood , he has a clear road before him .

		If he has the trick of handling , he may safely reduce the unexpected to for - mula .

		When our hero is assailed by ten vil - lains in a dark alley , our fear for him is the perfectly tolerable fear of an exciting dream .

		It costs us nothing .

		We know we shall be comfortably awake presently , and our friend Tom the ex -
Yale	ORGANIZATION	halfback , or our friend Sir Drivel of the Brand-new Spurs , will be safe out of the late unpleasantness with nothing worse to show for it than a wound or two of the self-healing kind : `` The ethereal sub - stance closed , not long divisible . ''

		Thou - sands of years ago the human race constituted itself a committee of the whole for the Pro- tection of Romantic Heroes .

		And this brings us to the compromising fact that the gamble is not a square one .

		The dice are loaded , the wheel has a secret brake , to our advantage .

		The goddess of fortune has no chance at all against us .

		And there is no denying that this goddess as pictured by romance is often a plump and earthy per - son .

		Though money be dross and rightly despised by moral Man , romance reminds us that it still glitters for our delight .

		And under the guidance of romance we may safely pursue it , daring the sea sharks about the treasure-laden coral reef , or the land sharks about the green tables of
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is the dead hand , too : it can make only feebly hostile demonstrations against us .

		Doubtful wills , long-lost heirs , the whole field of inheritance with its cloth of gold lies open to us .

		Certain quaint survivals in Brit - ish family usage are of incalculable value to the story-teller .

		Entail and male succession still make possible the most romantically satisfying stock situation in modern life .

		A fortune plus a title here we have the summum bonum of the fate genteel , the grand prize in the gamble of material fortune .

		Democracy offers nothing like it unless , as in the instance of a Little Lord
Fauntleroy	PERSON	or a
T. Tembarom	PERSON	, it offers everything .

		No doubt there are always a few American citi - zens who stand a chance of fauntleroying into a British title and estates .

		But the kind of truth that is stranger than romantic fiction is , after all , too rare for impressive tabula - tion .

		We suspect the average
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	has his chances of British succession `` figgered pretty close . ''

		But why stress the dingy material side of romance ?

		Is n't it love that makes the world go round ?

		Yes , but here too the cynic may cap us with his counter-saw , since what is it but money that makes the mare to go ?

		Even the romance of simplicity is lighted by that yellow reflection .

		Love in a cottage has the charm and piquancy of a paradox .

		If we did not secretly believe it a desperate thing to scorn wealth , what romance would there be in the act of scorning ?

		Therefore , despite a recent tendency in favor of proletary hero - ines , the daughter of the rich holds her own pretty well with the romancers .

		For there is always the poor and noble youth to pair her off with .

		She may effect a minor thrill by threatening to cast away her all for his sake as he may by declaring that he can never , never marry an heiress .

		But we are reasonably confident that neither of them will | be so inept when the time comes ; and the romancer who knows his business sees to it that they are not .

		Otherwise he might as well be a mere novelist .

		But the glamour of gold that shall be won , the glamour of adventure and of battle , the glamour of love , calf-love victorious and undying , these are only manifestations of the larger glamour of youth young blood , young hope , young folly .

		Youth cares noth - ing for subtleties of character and action , so why should romance ?

		Youth cares for things , for acts , for types , for dreams above all for 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	itself .

		Therefore romance commonly begins and ends with the business of being young , ardent , striving , successful ; with the busi - ness of reaching goals , the goal of wealth , the goal of fame , the goal of mating .

		When a man has reached or definitely failed to reach these goals he may as well be dead , as far as youth or romance cares .

		It is this sublime and innocent egotism which middle age knocks out of us , and which , in certain moods at least , we sorrowfully regret .

		I have heard men say they wished they could live life over , school days and college days particularly .

		Sometimes they wished it because they thought they might make a better job of it in one way or another ; sometimes , it seemed to be simply a longing , or a theory of a longing , to live things over literally , to have one 's cake again .

		I doubt if it is much more than a theory in most instances : I for one would not be a child again , or a boy again , or a calf - lover again , even `` just for to-night . ''

		And yet it is good for age to be reminded of youth , now and then , as something more than a mere object of discipline or condescension .

		And romance so reminds us .

		Sentimentalism smears us with syrups , it tries to divert us from solid fare by cloying us with sweet - meats ; and cheap romance is always encum - bering itself with sentimentalism .

		But true romance , high romance , is not a jelly or a condiment .

		A real if primary and vague idealism informs it .

		Youth has faith , if only in luck , if only in desire , if only in the man at the top ; and romance bears the standard of the faith .

		It bears , at its best , the standard of a higher faith in chivalry , in selfless devotion , in aspiration for something nobler than good luck , or satisfied desire , or `` suc - cess . ''

		It enwraps `` life , '' half - conceals it from us in a golden mist .

		Illusion ?

		Yes : the fruitful illusion of youth , the healing illusion which we can never quite afford to outgrow or outface , later on . '

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		UTOPIA 'S QUADBICENTENNIAL falls in
this year of 1916	DATE	, and we may picture to ourselves the people of that happy commonwealth as this
summer	DATE	cele - brating , with pageants and oratory , music and dancing , and other forms of innocent jubilation , the four-hundredth anniversary of their country 's birth in the brain of the gentle and cultured Sir Thomas More .

		We will overlook the fact that `` Utopia '' was written some time before
1516	DATE	, and as no one knows exactly when it was conceived in the author 's mind we will unhesitatingly date the ideal republic 's beginning in the year when , at
Louvain	LOCATION	-LRB- the place is notable -RRB- , the political romance was first made public naturally in the tongue of all European scholars of the time , Latin .

		How far we non-Utopians still fall short of the high standards , or of some of the high standards , maintained by the Utopians , becomes apparent on opening the book at almost any page .

		For exam - ple , gold is so little valued by these people that they show their contempt for its meretricious glit - ter by using it for making some of their meaner utensils , and an earring of gold is regarded as a badge of exceptional infamy .

		Silver likewise is mere rubbish in their eyes ; `` and thus they take care by all possible means to render gold and silver of no esteem ; and from hence it is that while other nations part with their gold and silver as unwillingly as if one tore out their bowels , those of Utopia would look on this giving in all they possess of these metals -LRB- when there were any use for them -RRB- but as the parting with a trifle or as we esteem the loss of a penny ! ''

		A glimpse of the home life of him to whom the world owes this celebrated work is refreshing in these days .

		Erasmus in one of his letters has immortalized that happy household , wherein `` none , man or woman , but readeth or studieth the liberal arts , yet is their chief care of piety .

		There is never any seen idle ; the head of the house governs it , not by a lofty carriage and oft rebukes , but by gentle - ness and amiable manners .

		Every member is busy in his place , performing his duty with alacrity ; nor is sober mirth wanting . ''

		HUMOROUS ASPECTS OF A SERIOUS CALLING will be found in a modest pamphlet of twenty-two pages which the uninstructed might dismiss with a hasty glance and thereby miss an opportunity to prolong their lives with a hearty laugh .

		In a valedictory utterance intended for the people of
Newton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, but likely to find a larger audi - ence , Miss
Elizabeth P. Thurston	PERSON	, retiring librarian of that city , says in her yearly Report : `` It is not necessary to remind you that a librarian must of necessity know everything : must be ready to dictate papers through the telephone to club mem - bers at a moment 's notice , and
Newton	PERSON	has prob - ably more clubs than any other city in the world .

		A librarian is called upon to give a synopsis of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's system of philosophy and the best receipt for doughnuts : readers wish to know who wrote Gray 's ` Elegy , ' how to find
Bunyon	PERSON	's ` Paradise Lost , ' or how to spell ` morage , that kind of a lake you see in the air . '

		Some little girl after having read ` Elsie 's Girlhood , ' ` Elsie 's Motherhood , ' ` Elsie 's Widowhood / says , ` Can I have `` Elsie 's Boyhood '' ? '

		A small boy of per - haps thirteen years , after wandering helplessly about the Reference Room for some time , asks for something on ` methodized reproductive invention / for school use . ''

		But the
Newton	LOCATION	librarian is not for a moment perplexed by any of the inquiries ;
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 495 for , as it is stated concerning the resources of that library , `` there is no library that can be com - pared with it for constitutionalistic ratiocination , for indef atigation of superinerrability and per - fection generally . ''

		Miss
Thurston	PERSON	resigns her office after thirty-five years of highly successful discharge of its duties , and her going is cause of deep regret .

		Mr.
Harold T. Dougherty	PERSON	, formerly librarian at
Pawtucket	LOCATION	,
R. I.	PERSON	, is her successor .

		JOURNALISM 'S INCREASING DIGNITY AS A PROFES - SION during the
last two decades	DATE	can not but rejoice the heart of all who hold that to contribute to the moulding of public opinion through the press is among the noblest of callings .

		Twenty years ago the school-trained candidate for a position in news - paper work was either an unheard-of being or , if not that , an object of mirthful derision .

		In no event was he to be taken seriously .

		Since then schools of journalism have arisen and prospered , and their number is growing .

		Their standards are being raised , and it is becoming clear that no training can be too good , too broad , too liberal , for those who are to furnish the people with the daily reading matter that with too many readers is their only reading matter .

		Illustrative of this tendency to recognize the importance of the journalist 's work is the recent step taken at
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity in lengthening the course in its School of Journalism from three to four years , experience having shown that the education thought neces - sary for journalistic work can not be given in less than the period required for obtaining a college diploma .

		Only a few years ago , as it now seems , the addition of a third year to the course in vari - ous schools of journalism throughout the land was hailed as momentous .

		Shall we before long see a fifth added to the now prescribed four years ?

		Art is long , and journalism is no exception ; yet practical considerations will set a limit to the time that can be given to preparation for even the most exacting art .

		THE SOFT ANSWER THAT TURNETH AWAY WRATH has been discovered by the spelling-refonnei-s .

		At an `` entheuziastik '' meeting of educators , further specified as the `` Aneual Konferens ov
Edeukai	LOCATION	- shonal Ascesiaishonz in the Euniversiti of
London	LOCATION	, '' no less an authority than Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, LL.D. , D.Litt , , F.B.A. , expressed himself , as reported by `` The Pyoneer ov Simp Kf yd Spel - ing , '' to the effect that the cause so dear to these reformers `` woz not entyrli without referens tu the grait strugel in which the kuntri woz engaijd .

		Thai wer aul ekspekting and hoeping that , at the end ov the Wor , thair wood be kloeser eunion between diferent naishonz ; at the veri leest sum duling and blunting ov the sharp and dainjerus ej ov nashonal feeling , sum kaaming ov that spirit ov nashonaliti which werkt az a dainjerus eksploe - siv and woz amung the kauzez ov the present dizaaster .

		How many would they have to learn if the various schools of sim - plified spelling should make any considerable progress in their several undertakings ?

		In read - ing the foregoing quoted passage an unreformed speller is puzzled to account for the escape of `` English '' from molestation or mutilation at the hands of the reformers .

		One would have expected `` Inglish . ''

		`` Tu '' and `` too , '' for `` to '' and `` two '' respectively , might invite comment , especially in connection with `` kood '' and `` book . ''

		There is food for mild mirth in the spellings `` foolfilment '' -LRB- of hopes -RRB- and `` hrepfool . ''

		THE AUTHOR OF `` SAFETY FIRST , '' the slogan now heard round the world , is said to have been the late
Josiah Strong	PERSON	, whose recent death deserves more general notice than it has received .

		He devoted the greater part of his life and energies to the improvement of the condition of his fellow - men , especially the urban portion of his fellow - men .

		Such books of his as `` Our Country , '' `` The Challenge of the City , '' `` Religious Movements for Social Betterment , '' `` The New Era , '' `` Expansion , '' and `` The Times and Young Men '' show clearly enough the causes that he had most at heart .

		For twelve years he was secretary of the
Evangelical Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, resigning this post in
1898	DATE	to give himself more unreservedly to the `` safety first '' movement , organizing for this purpose the
American Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute of
Social Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was born at
Naperville	LOCATION	, 111. ,
Jan. 19 , 1847	DATE	, was graduated from
Western Reserve College	ORGANIZATION	in
1869	DATE	, and
two years later	DATE	from
Walnut Hills Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		He was chaplain at
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	from
1873	DATE	to
1876	DATE	, and also instructor in natural theology and rhetoric .

		But before many years he was devoting himself to social service and writing books and articles in its interest .

		`` Our Country '' was trans - lated into a number of foreign languages , and that with other books of his had a large circulation at home and abroad .

		More than three hundred thou - sand copies of works from his pen are said to have been sold in English-speaking countries .

		A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR has arisen .

		It is noth - ing short of this : Shall the study of formal gram - mar in school be continued or dropped * Dr.
Abra	PERSON	- ham
Flexner	ORGANIZATION	has aroused considerable discussion by advising that formal grammar be no longer studied as a regular school course , such evidence as we possess pointing to the futility of this study as an aid to correct speaking and writing .

		This alleged utterance of his contains nothing to startle one in these days .

		The unconscious acquisition of grammar by reading the best authors and hearing the best speakers has long been held by many to be the only sensible method to follow in this de - partment of learning , to which formerly so much attention was given that the name `` grammar school '' was used to denote the school immediately 496 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	below the high school .

		Now we hear of nothing but `` grades . ''

		Parsing one 's way through `` Para - dise Lost , '' or through the first book at least , was one of the severer intellectual exercises in the old - fashioned curriculum .

		No wonder the reading of the poem for the pleasure of it became something unheard of .

		But the old methods did seem to inspire more respect for grammar , for correctness in speech and writing , than the present compara - tive neglect of `` formal grammar . ''

		All young pupils ought in some way to have impressed upon them the sinfulness -LRB- in an intellectual sense -RRB- of violating the rules of intelligible speech , the few principal rules that can be easily enough taught even to the very immature .

		Later a dip into the Latin language , or if possible some study of both Latin and Greek , will give a grasp of grammatical principles that will tend to make an observance of those principles almost second nature .

		But how - ever it may best be done , there should be incul - cated some sense of the fitness , the propriety , the ultimate necessity , of obedience to the rules of grammar .

		If something of formality , some little drill in formal grammar , is necessary to this end , let it be retained .

		... BOOKS VERSUS BOMBS with this alliterative heading we note the competitive struggle now in progress for the possession of rags .

		Rags have always entered into the composition of high-grade paper , the best paper being pure linen , the cheaper grades part linen and part something else , gener - ally wood-pulp .

		At present the manufacture of high explosives such explosives as wrecked the library at
Louvain	LOCATION	is monopolizing the supply of rags , and the world 's printing is more and more done upon cheap and perishable paper .

		In fact , the paper-makers seem to have retired from the contest , and the bomb-factories have it now all their own way , so sternly imperious are the ways of war .

		`` The Library Journal , '' which has hith - erto made a point of using only good and durable paper , largely composed of rags , announces its inability to secure its usual supply of such paper and the possibility of its issues for the next year or two being of such perishable material that a century or more hence its files will reveal a con - spicuous gap marking the period of the Great War .

		It points out this possibility in more gen - eral terms , however , making it one that applies to all the literature of the present time ; for the insane and disastrous conflict between books and bombs is nothing short of worldwide .

		FITTING THE VERB TO THE NOUN is often as nice a task as fitting the punishment to the crime .

		In the
England	LOCATION	of bluff
King Hal	ORGANIZATION	and of good Queen
Bess	PERSON	justice was satisfied with exacting the death penalty for all offences from minor derelictions to deliberate murder ; and in the English of most users of that language the sense is held to be suffi - ciently expressed if all events are made to `` occur '' or to `` take place , '' if all expectations `` materialize '' or fail to do so , and if all those who are straining after success either `` put it over '' or `` fall down .

		It takes much less time and thought , and it calls for much less selective skill , to phrase our meaning in general terms than to put it into the verbal mold which it exactly fills , no more and no less .

		The first process is like thrusting the hand into a mitten , the second like fitting it neatly with a glove .

		Delane , the great editor of `` The Times , '' devoted a large part of his editorial energy to the correc - tion of inaccurate or slipshod expressions on the part of his subordinates .

		This insistence upon the right word for the given thought is referred to in Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	's recent life of the man who for thirty-six prosperous years guided the fortunes of
London	LOCATION	's leading newspaper .

		Dean
Wace	ORGANIZATION	, one of his editorial staff , wrote of him : `` I remember his being particularly indignant with the use of the slipshod phrase that a marriage , or a funeral , or a race , had ' taken place . '

		It was mere slovenliness of expression , he said , instead of saying that a marriage had been solemnized or a race run .

		He exerted a valuable influence in this way toward maintaining in the public mind a standard of cor - rect English writing . ''

		Easy , as distinguished from nicely accurate , writing may not always be hard reading , but it is often what might be called drowsy reading as compared with that difficult writing in which the expression of the thought is as clean-cut and as clear as a crystal , and in which the exquisite fitness of each word sends a little thrill of delight through the reader of discernment , and keeps him ever agreeably on the alert .

		THE DEMISE OP `` HARPER 'S WEEKLY '' after fur - nishing wholesome entertainment and no little instruction to thousands of readers for half a cen - tury , and to somewhat fewer thousands for nine years beyond the half - century , is cause for regret .

		With older readers this famous periodical is largely associated with scenes and events in the Civil War , and with
Thomas Nast	PERSON	's war sketches and political cartoons , and later with the noble and commanding editorial utterances of
George William Curtis	PERSON	and
Carl Schurz	PERSON	.

		But what gave to the paper its enviable popularity with general readers was its generous and skilful use of the timely illustration , the cartoon and the caricature .

		When the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper acquired the same facility , and in lavishness outdid the pictorial attractions of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' the fate of the latter , though averted for a time , was inevitable .

		Not any marked decline in the periodical itself , but the turning of its patrons more and more toward the cheaper substitute , was the undoing of this famous pub - lication .

		Not even a
George Harvey	PERSON	or a
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	could turn back the trend of things and restore the `` Weekly '' to its old place .

		A FALLACY OF THE TIMES would have the war - harassed world take comfort to itself in the fond hope that this bath of blood is a cleansing flood from which mankind will emerge with higher ideals and nobler aims .

		In literature there are to be no more decadent novels , no more sexual studies in the guise of fiction , no more morbidly introspec - tive essays posing as wholesome tales .

		But is it not time that some of these regenerative effects
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 497 should show themselves in our current literature ?

		Is the tone of our printed matter any higher than it was two years ago ?

		Is it even as high ?

		In
England	LOCATION	we hear of a `` Rainbow Society '' for the private circulation of such dubious productions as Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	's novel , `` The Rainbow , '' said to have been visited with the censor 's disapproval , and other similar - works .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	there is reported to be an unprecedented circulation of vicious fiction .

		And everywhere the far from ele - vating , rather the brutalizing , realistic war-nar - rative is in eager demand .

		The
London	LOCATION	book - market is improving , is already notably brisker than a year ago ; but it is the war-book and the cheap novel that bring in the shillings , not the noble and purified work of literature that was expected to mark the rebirth of a world baptized in blood .

		A REALISTIC CONCEPTION OF EDUCATION , by which the pupil is imagined as climbing , not exactly a hill of knowledge , but rather a succession of flights of stairs , was prevalent some years ago among a portion of our uneducated southern pop - ulation ; and it may not yet have disappeared .

		In that recent notable autobiography , `` The Black Man 's Burden , '' its author , Mr.
William H. Holtz	PERSON	- claw , who worked his way through
Tuskegee Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute and became the founder and head of a similar school in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, alludes to this curious con - ception as follows : `` Before I left home we had some peculiar ideas about what a ` college ' -LRB- as we all called boarding-schools at that time -RRB- was like .

		We all thought it was composed of one immense building with , say , four stories , and that the first year you were at school you were placed on the first floor , and promoted from floor to floor until you reached the top floor , when you would have finished school .

		Exceptionally bright students might skip a floor .

		Well , it so happened that when I reached Tuskegee I was placed to begin with in the attic , and there was great rejoicing at home when I sent back the intelligence that I was on the highest floor .

		It was a confirmation of what the old folks at home had said , I already knew enough without going to school . ''

		To know a thing `` from the ground up '' must have had a very real meaning to Mr.
Holtzclaw	PERSON	's friends and relatives at home .

		A CONTRIBUTION TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
JOHN CALVIN	PERSON	, credited to `` a catalog ` made in
Oregon	LOCATION	' by a trained librarian '' is just now promoting the gaiety , perhaps not exactly of nations , but of the readers of the magazine , `` Public Libraries . ''

		In its current issue a chapter of a series entitled `` Adventures among Libraries '' makes mention of a catalogue entry under the Genevan reformer 's name referring the reader to
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	's `` My Summer in a Garden . ''

		In that ever-enjoyable classic it is said of
Calvin	LOCATION	, as the above-referred-to anonymous writer points out , that `` although he was of Maltese race , I have reason to suppose that he was American by birth .

		.

		his antecedents were wholly unknown ... He preferred as his table-cloth on the floor , a cer - tain well-known church journal ... He had no religious prejudices ... He could do almost anything but speak ... Mice amused him ... His conscience never seemed to interfere with his slumbers . ''

		Thus it seems that in his -LRB- or her -RRB- straining for completeness the
Oregon	LOCATION	person even i included Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's pet cat , named after -LRB- by about three centuries and a half -RRB- the celebrated contemporary and antagonist of Servetus .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		`` HAMLET '' AND `` THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your correspondent Mr.
H. S. Howard	PERSON	, in the issue of
April 27	DATE	, cautions your readers against `` concluding that
Bacon	PERSON	is not ` Shakespeare ' '' until they have decided by whom and why Hamlet 's words , `` Sense sure you have Else could you not have motion '' were omitted from the
1623	DATE	edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		He asserts , as Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	did before him , that the erroneous belief that `` in the absence of sense there can be no motion '' was contained in the
1604	DATE	edition of `` Hamlet '' and in the
1605	DATE	edition of
Bacon	LOCATION	's `` Advancement of - Learning , '' was omitted from the
1623	DATE	edition of the play , and was corrected by
Bacon	PERSON	in the
1623	DATE	edition of his book .

		The explanation for this coincidence if it be one is very simple .

		In the first place , Hamlet 's words do not mean what
Bacon	PERSON	's words mean .

		Hamlet , in his fierce upbraiding of his mother , wholly forgetting the obligations of filial piety , this talking Lord always throws restraint and convention to the winds when he `` accosts '' the women he loves , tells her she must be endowed with mental faculties else could she not have sensual desires .

		That the words `` sense '' and `` motion '' had the meaning we give them is proved by a very similar passage in `` Measure for Measure '' -LRB- I. 4 , 57-59 -RRB- : Angelo , a man whose blood Is very snow-broth , one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense .

		In `` Othello '' -LRB- I. 3 , 333 -RRB- `` motions '' is defined as `` carnal stings , '' `` unbitted lusts . ''

		Hamlet 's words are true , and could not have been omitted from the later edition on the ground that their author no longer believed that locomotion without sense was impossible .

		For aught we know ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	never believed or heard of this absurd `` classical '' doctrine if there ever was such a doctrine .


Bacon	PERSON	did not credit the ancients with the belief that motion without sense was impossible , as Messrs.
Howard	PERSON	and
Baxter	PERSON	imply , but that motion `` at discretion '' was impossible without sense .

		The omission of the words `` at discretion '' makes all the difference in the world , as any one knows who has ever seen the antics of a freshly - beheaded chicken .

		Bacon made his meaning per - fectly clear by adding the words `` or sense without a soul '' to the preceding `` motion at discretion without sense '' words that the Baconians slur over .

		Had Shakespeare intended Hamlet to say what the Baconians would put into his mouth , he 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	must have added the words `` at discretion '' ; with - out them , Hamlet 's words can be understood to mean only one thing .

		Why Shakespeare or the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	stage-director or the Folio editors omitted the words in question is answered when we explain why some 220 other lines which appear in the
1604	DATE	Quarto have been omitted from the
1623	DATE	Folio .

		These cuts involve chiefly passages of a philosophical character , and were made because the play is too long for acting purposes and because these passages retard the dramatic movement of the action .

		It is not impos - sible that Shakespeare himself omitted some of these lines when he revised the play .

		That the reader may judge for himself how the dramatic effectiveness of this part of Hamlet 's speech is improved by the omission of the italicized verses I append part of it : At your age The hey-day in the blood is tame , it 's humble , And waits upon the judgment : and what judgment Would step from this -LSB- man -RSB- to this -LSB- man -RSB- ?

		Sense sure you have Else could you not have motion : but sure that sense -LSB- i. e. judgment -RSB- Is apoplex 'd : for -LSB- even -RSB- madness would not -LSB- so -RSB- err , Nor sense to ecstasy -LSB- i. e. madness -RSB- was ne'er so thrall 'd But it reserv 'd -LSB- i. e. retained -RSB- some quantity -LSB- i. e. power -RSB- of choice , To serve in such a difference .

		What devil was ' t That thus hath cozen 'd you at hoodman-blind ?

		Read the speech with the italicized lines and then without them .

		For the study , we want every word that
Shakespeare	PERSON	put into Hamlet 's mouth ; but on the stage much can be spared .

		Why is it , I wonder , that Baconians never stick to facts ?

		Are they wilfully perverse , or are they merely obsessed ?

		Here is Mr.
Howard	PERSON	, who in all other respects may be `` a piece of virtue , '' saying that I avoided answering the last part of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book `` because it ` deals with ciphers , ' etc. '' I refused -LRB- cf. THE DIAL ,
Dec. 9 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- to consider the latter half of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book because he there tries to prove that
Bacon	PERSON	was Shakespeare without having first disproved , in the first half of his book , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was Shakespeare .

		MOKE ABOUT `` SPOON EIVEE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
April 27	DATE	appeared a communi - cation inspired by a few impressions of the '' Spoon River Anthology '' recently printed in these col - umns .

		I agree with your correspondent that `` Spoon River '' needs no apologia .

		No one to-day would suggest a defence of the laboratory method .

		Many of us , however , have firm `` personal convictions '' that the laboratory method is unsuited to the high purposes of poetry .

		`` Spoon River '' is an excel - lent laboratory manual .

		I think we can classify it as good science , a faithful tabulation of a certain type of psychological or physiological fact .

		As such it needs no apologia .

		I have no quarrel with scientific truth , but I do feel disgusted when the wild-eyed iconoclast in his mad desire to improve the `` accepted oracles of criticism '' drags into liter - ature , by the hair , a set of scientific facts which no more make good literature than the bull of Bashen could make good music .

		No one denies that `` things do happen as they happen in ` Spoon River . ' ''

		Without questioning the valuable infor - mation of the things that happen in ``
Spoon River	LOCATION	, '' we turn them over to the professor of psychology and the sociological investigator .

		There is a vital difference between science and art .

		The method of the first is analysis ; but art does more than analyze and reflect life .

		When science has examined and classified its facts , its work is ended .

		Art may stoop to the results of science , but it uses them freely for the purpose of a higher synthesis .

		Your correspondent clamors for a full recogni - tion of Me by literature .

		Truly , literature has partially failed when it does not turn all of life , the lights and the shadows , the good and the evil , to account .

		Literature must reflect life .

		This much and no more both psychology and the social sciences do ; yet no one will call either of these art .

		Literature does more than merely reflect life , its sublime function is to react upon life .

		It elevates life and informs it with a higher meaning .

		Emerson ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are not great because they reflect life .

		The poorest drunk - ard in his `` last delirium '' can do that .

		They are great , and their writings are real literature , because they do what the drunkard does not do they reanimate life , they modify it , they lift it above the level of analysis by pouring into it the fulness of their thought and feeling .

		Literature contrib - utes something original to life .

		This is a distinc - tion between art and science .

		Too often art , and philosophy likewise , must endure the insolence of science .

		Too often in this skeptical world science has claimed the last word , and has trampled the rich things of the spirit in the dust .

		Its business is to analyze and to classify the facts of the material world .

		The function of art and of philosophy and of religion is to lead us deeper into the realm of the spirit .

		Here science must remain dumb .

		I object to those votaries of science who leave the outer porch to set up their brazen image in the inner shrine of the temple where poetry worships .

		Science has its legitimate field , but the nature of that field renders science inadequate to those needs of life which only poetry and her sister arts can satisfy .

		We need not fear that truth will disappear from the earth if literature does not speak in vulgar accents .

		Truth has the happy faculty of caring for itself .

		Moreover , the type of truth demanded by your correspondent will be cared for by science .

		Rather should we be fearful lest the truth of poetry shall die .

		We can get any number of psychologists and sociologists , the woods are full of them .

		It is the poet for whom we strain our eyes .

		I deplore with your correspondent the `` decadent sentimentality '' which renders much literature dis - gusting .

		Nevertheless , we need not in denouncing this go to the other extreme .

		In a recent essay in THE DIAL occurred these excellent words ; `` I for one believe that reticence , in life and in art , is a
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 499 JAPANESE PALINDROMES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The subject of palindromes happened to come up in my class the other day .

		After I had given the most common English example , I asked for some examples of Japanese palindromes .

		This brought out specimens of three or four kinds : those which appear when written in the Japanese syllabary -LRB- kana -RRB- ; those in Chinese ideographs ; those in Roman letters ; and those in two of these kinds at one and the same time .

		A few of these examples may be cited here .

		Sa-to To-sa -LRB- also read To-sake -RRB- is a personal name that makes a palindrome in both the Japa - nese syllabary and the Chinese ideographs .

		Mi-wa - ta Rin-zo , Ku-bo-deva Yassu-hisa , and Wata-nabe Watara are personal names that form palindromes only with Chinese ideographs -LRB- indicated by sylla - bles -RRB- , although in the last case there is a hint of the palindrome in the Roman letters .

		A-ka-sa-ka , the name of one of the districts of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, is a palindrome only when Romanized ; and Ta-ba-ta , the name of one of our suburbs , is a palindrome only in Japanese .

		Ki-tsu-tsu-ki -LRB- wood-pecker -RRB- is another example .

		Ta-ke-ya ga ya-ke-ta -LRB- `` The bamboo shop has burned '' -RRB- forms a palindrome in Japanese kana only .

		There are two Japanese poems -LRB- of thirty-one syllables -RRB- that make good palindromes ; but , being artificial , they do not make good sense , so I shall not attempt any translation thereof .

		The first one is called `` Hatsu-yume , '' or `` First Dream '' -LRB- of the less corrupting influence than loose babbling .

		By all means let us tell our children all the essential facts of sex .

		But it does not follow that we need to introduce them into brothels , or even into our own bed-chambers . ''

		The writer of these sentences decries that frankness which has so arrogantly taken possession of recent life and literature .

		Literature as art must ever minister to the higher needs of man , to his feelings , thought , imagination , and to his sense of the good and the beautiful .

		It can not do this by presenting evil in lurid pictures .

		At best , this is only negative ; more often it is seductive .

		Literature can fulfil its higher mission by informing life with new vitality and with posi - tive and original strength .

		It remains science as long as it merely reflects life ; it becomes art when it recreates Me .

		By all means let us have careful and scientific investigation of the essential facts of life , but let not the fire-breathing iconoclast throw the dirty stuff in our faces and bid us call it poetry .

		Let us turn these facts over to the social and psycholog - ical analyst .

		He is equipped with the germproof i uniform and the disinfectants and the smelling j salts that are necessary in handling them .

		`` Spoon River '' thoroughly analyzes and reflects a certain type of life ; but I seriously doubt that it meets the requirement of `` high seriousness '' which makes poetry an art .

		As science , it needs -RSB- no apologia ; as poetry , it needs some chloride of

		New Year -RRB- .

		It is written on a sheet of paper , folded in the shape of a ship , and laid under the pillow , as a charm to ensure a good dream .

		It reads as follows : Na-ga-ki yo no To-o no ne-mu-ri no Mi-na me-za-me Na-mi no-ri fu-ne no O-to no yo-ki ka na .

		It should be explained that ka and ga are written with the same character , with diacritical marks -LRB- in prose -RRB- to indicate the `` muddy '' sound of ga ; and that mu and fu are interchangeable .

		So the poem is a better palindrome in Japanese kana than when it is transliterated into Roman letters .

		The other poem is a first-class palindrome in the Japanese syllabary , as follows : To-ku ta-ta-shi Sa-to no ta-ka-mu-ra Yu-ki shi-ro-shi Ki-yu-ra-mu ka-ta no To-sa-shi ta-ta-ku to .

		Note how the verbal palindrome , `` shi-ro-shi , '' forms the pivot , exactly in the centre .

		This poem was written by a famous scholar , Dr.
Haga	PERSON	.

		The Japanese syllabary lends itself admirably to the forming of palindromes .

		MORE NOTES ON
POE	ORGANIZATION	'S FIRST SCHOOL IN
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As a postscript to my letter in your latest issue concerning
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	's first school in
London	LOCATION	, two additional items which have since come to my notice may be of interest .

		The school at 146 Sloane Street ,
Chelsea	LOCATION	, kept by the
Misses Dubourg	ORGANIZATION	, which
Poe	PERSON	attended in
1816	DATE	, was a small private house of ordinary type .

		It was erected about the beginning of the
19th century	DATE	and was removed in
1885	DATE	to make way for the present building .

		`` Pauline Dubourg '' is the name of one of the characters in
Poe	PERSON	's tale , `` The Murders in the Rue Morgue . ''

		He took the surname , beyond doubt , from the list of his personal friends and acquaint - ances , precisely as he took the name of
Bransby	LOCATION	, the schoolmaster of Stoke-Newington , for his tale of ``
William Wilson	PERSON	. ''

		These autobiographical references in disguise make one wonder how many other instances , as yet undetected , may lie hidden in his pages .

		Since the surname
Dubourg	ORGANIZATION	is founded on fact , it is not , I think , unreasonable to assume that the Christian name
Pauline	PERSON	goes with it .

		In other words , this family , all traces of which had been lost until a few months ago , now contributes three names to be henceforth associated with
Poe	PERSON	's child - hood in
England	LOCATION	,
Francis	PERSON	, presumably the father since he was the tenant according to the poor rate books from
1816	DATE	to
1822	DATE	;
George	PERSON	, the brother , who was
Allan	PERSON	's clerk ; and
Pauline Dubourg	PERSON	, in fiction a laundress of
Paris	LOCATION	, in life
Poe	PERSON	's school teacher in
London	LOCATION	.

May 25	DATE	THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A `` STAND-PAT '' REPUBLICAN .

		* When an American political leader of dis - tinction , one who served as a governor of

United States	LOCATION	throughout the administrations of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	and
Roosevelt	PERSON	, who had a conspicuous part in the nominations of
Elaine	LOCATION	,
Harrison	PERSON	, and
McKinley	PERSON	, and had differences of national prominence with
Hanna	PERSON	,
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and
Taft	PERSON	, writes at sixty - nine and `` in retirement '' his `` Notes of a Busy Life , '' it is an event of importance to students of political history and of interest to all who follow with care the constantly changing politics of the nation .

		`` When the writer is
Joseph Benson Foraker	PERSON	, the reader is assured a vigorous account including eulogies of countless Republicans , here and there a sparing comment upon a Democrat , and a frank acceptance of all that goes to constitute '' stand-pat '' Republicanism .

		We were recently given the autobiography of an insurgent Republican , and somewhat later the account of certain phases of `` the most interesting American '' ; but neither the first , which dealt largely with the personal politics of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, nor the second , which gave us little more than a background of personal interest , revealed a great deal of Republicanism .

		It was left to Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	to write a painstaking , if not impartial , polit - ical account of the more important develop - ments within the Republican party in the period since the close of Reconstruction .

		These two bulky volumes are not in a class with the briefer recollections of
John Sherman	PERSON	,
Shelby M. Cullom	PERSON	, and
Adlai Stevenson	PERSON	; although they have in common with these a large emphasis upon the personal element in political relationships .

		The only account of this period which one may care to use with Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	's work is Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	's biography of
Marcus A. Hanna	PERSON	; and where the editor of `` The New Republic '' has led in critical interpretation of the changing phases of Republicanism , Mr.

		General Slocum .

		He records General
Sherman	PERSON	as saying , in substance : `` Do n't forget that when you have crossed the
Savannah River	LOCATION	you will be in
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		You need not be so careful there about private property as we have been .

		The more of it you destroy the better it will be .

		The people of
South Carolina	LOCATION	should be made to feel the war , for they brought it on and are responsible more than anybody else for our presence here .

		Now is the time to punish them . ''

		Cherishing such a recollection , Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	twenty years later became , in the words of ex-President
Hayes	PERSON	, `` popular with the hurrah boys . ''

		When charged in
1885	DATE	with waving the `` bloody shirt , '' he answered that the shirt was undoubtedly bloody , but that `` the Democratic hoodlums and thugs of the South had made it so . ''

		Later , in a joint debate with his antag - onist in the gubernatorial contest , cheers and applause and election followed his sally : `` While one Democrat was killing Lincoln another was trying to kill
William H. Seward	PERSON	. ''

		Serving as Governor of
Ohio	LOCATION	during
Cleveland	LOCATION	's first administration ,
Foraker	PERSON	was brought into great prominence as the exponent on the stump of the Republican party `` that fought the war . ''

		He was a relentless critic of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		It was Foraker who , after
Cleveland	LOCATION	's famous order for the return of state flags , telegraphed a protesting former comrade-in-arms : `` No rebel flags will be sur - rendered while I am Governor .

		V In the midst of his second term as Governor , he went as a delegate to the Republican national conven - tion of
1888	DATE	.


John Sherman	PERSON	was
Ohio	LOCATION	's can - didate , and
Foraker	PERSON	seconded the nomination .

		As it became evident that
Sherman	PERSON	could not secure the nomination , two other
Ohio	LOCATION	men were widely discussed as possibilities , Congressman
William McKinley	PERSON	and Governor
Foraker	PERSON	.

		It was charged at the time , and the charges have reappeared from time to time , that
Foraker	PERSON	was not faithful to the
Sherman	PERSON	candidacy .

		This was partly due to the presence in
Chicago	LOCATION	of the
Foraker March	ORGANIZATION	- ing Club of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	and partly to the effect of one of
Foraker	ORGANIZATION	's earlier speeches in this convention .

		One correspondent wrote : `` The effect of the speech was to make Governor Foraker the favorite of the convention .

		It was manifest he stood before it an ideal parti - san , reckless of the censure of his enemies , proud of its achievements , and indifferent to every effect except that upon party success . ''

		After several ballots without decisive result , the convention adjourned over
Sunday	DATE	.

		Dur - ing this recess a message came from Blame positively refusing the use of his name .

		The
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 501 pressure increased in certain quarters to break from
Sherman	LOCATION	.

		The latter , although in Wash - ington , knew of this , and of the rumor that
Foraker	PERSON	was being considered as a vice - presidential candidate by certain
Elaine dele	PERSON	- gates .

		He telegraphed
Foraker	PERSON	of his refusal to withdraw at that time .

		Foraker tele - graphed in reply : `` I have refused to allow my name to be mentioned by anybody for anything , and I do not think it will be men - tioned in the convention ; but if it should be , it will be without my consent or approval , and if I should be nominated it will be declined unless you should request me to accept . ''

		This telegram was sent on
Sunday	DATE	.

		`` At two o ` clock
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	, '' writes Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	, `` I was wakened by a delegation of Blaine men , among whom were Senator
Stephen B. El	PERSON	kins of
West Virginia	LOCATION	and Honorable
Samuel Fessenden	PERSON	of
Connecticut	LOCATION	... They told me they had just come from a meeting of Blaine leaders , at which it was determined to throw the entire
Blaine	PERSON	strength to me on
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	, if I would accept the nomi - nation ... I told them I could not and would not accept the nomination , no matter how cordially it might be tendered unless preceded or accompanied with the request from
Sherman	PERSON	that I accept . ''

		The nomina - tion went to Governor
Harrison	PERSON	of
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Foraker	ORGANIZATION	's one opportunity was gone , although he received votes for the nomination in the convention of
1908	DATE	.

		The reputation acquired in this convention remained his title to national prominence until he came to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the meantime he had nominated McKinley three times , had written the
Minneapolis	LOCATION	platform , and `` his face had become as familiar as that of Grant or Blaine . ''

		Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	has devoted his second volume to the period since the campaign of
1896	DATE	.

		During twelve of these years he was in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		To this period belong the disagree - ments with
Roosevelt	PERSON	, particularly over the
Brownsville	LOCATION	affair , the sensational
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	charges of
1908	DATE	, and
Foraker	ORGANIZATION	's final break with
Taft	LOCATION	.

		To the present reviewer , it seems that the second volume is less valuable , as a political record and a personal revelation , than the first .

		The reason may be surmised .

		Up to
1896	DATE	,
Foraker	PERSON	was fighting the battles within his party with weapons dear to him from a young and emotional association .

		Moreover , he led the forces of aggression .

		After
1896	DATE	he represented the old tradition .

		he was `` standing pat . ''

		The party tenets of the new age did not excite his approval .

		As a conservative he held attention by satire and ready grasp of questions that arose in debate .

		But he will be remembered in this period , it is safe to say , for his aggressive campaign in behalf of the negro soldiers dismissed by
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		Into this cause he put his heart , and in doing so he was true to himself and the generation he typifies .

		Of the reform campaign of
1876	DATE	, the author writes : `` No reforms were needed , but a fact like that never interfered with a reform campaign . ''

		Ten years later he was saying : `` We Republicans are too old , have had too much experience , fought too many fights , and stand charged with too many responsibilities , to waste time listening to im - practical teachings about theoreticalisms . ''

		This attitude was still dominant in
1904	DATE	, when he wrote of an opponent : `` Instead of repre - senting railroads and corporations that were developing and carrying forward the great business interests of the country , which in the opinion of his nominator would have disquali - fied him for the Senatorship , he had a good general practice based on the quarrels of liti - gants , divorce suits and criminal cases , and that according to the same opinion , fitted him exactly for the public service . ''

		It is revealed repeatedly in these volumes that Mr.
Foraker	PERSON	was , as he has been described elsewhere , `` a proud , self-contained , and self-confident man whose nature it was to play a lone hand . ''

		502 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	A MATURE VIEW OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE .

		* In his eightieth year , Sir
Thomas Jackson	PERSON	has undertaken to supplement , his ''
Byzan	PERSON	- tine and Eomanesque Architecture '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL for
October 16 , 1913	DATE	-RRB- by a com - panion work on Gothic architecture .

		The book shows the experience and mellowness of age without its dogmatism , and easily takes rank as the most important general work on the subject in English .

		As in the `` Roman - esque Architecture , '' the author discusses only buildings which he himself has seen , which here include all those of first importance within the field covered by the title , and illustrates them by preference from his own inexhaustible sketch books .

		The method fol - lowed is an extended , but by no means complete , description of these buildings , arranged within each country in a generally historical order , and accompanied by tech - nical and historical introductions and a running commentary of artistic criticism .

		Although thus doubtless conceived as a gen - eral history of Gothic architecture , the book proves to be rather a vehicle for the presen - tation of the experiences and the views of a man whose professional contact with the sub - ject matter is wider , and whose critical views are in this regard more broadly based , than those of any other man now living .

		The deficiencies of the work are those of its predecessor in common , it must be con - fessed , with most writings in English on the history of art .

		They arise from the general confusion of thought regarding the applica - tion of historical methods to the treatment of artistic subjects , and regarding the categories of historical and critical writing .

		These mat - ters are well understood in
France	LOCATION	and Ger - many , and it is time that we ourselves should understand them and so put an end to the hybrid and unsatisfactory books which , with their useless duplication of effort , are the bane of history and criticism alike .

		The modern principle is a scientific division of labor , made necessary by the vast multiplica - tion of objects of historic interest and by the obscurity and intricacy of the ultimate evi - dences concerning them .

		Such a scientific method aims to substitute , in place of uncer - tain speculation on probabilities , the erection of an orderly historic edifice .

		The founda - tions consist of numerous monographic studies of the relevant monuments , and the multi - tude of obscure documents concerning them : * GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IN

		the superstructure , of studies in interpreta - tion and in the combination of a few elements .

		Only when these foundations are laid , and this superstructure erected , can the crowning feature of all , the synthetic presentation of historical development , be attempted .

		Con - siderations of wise economy , as well as of clearness and adaptation to purpose , suggest that in such a synthetic view the detailed description of individual monuments , the attempt to weigh individual bits of documen - tary evidence , be suppressed , and that , on the other hand , the widest reference be made to the individual studies of previous writers and the most recent views and discussions in ques - tions of interpretation .

		The Benedictines of
France	LOCATION	in the eigh - teenth century and the German historians of the nineteenth realized this , and turned first , with self-sacrificing energy and pains , to the minute study of the ultimate facts , which is so ignorantly spoken of as `` German scholar - ship . ''

		Ignorantly , because the practitioners have well understood that it is not the whole of scholarship , and have been the first to reap the fruit of their own earlier efforts .

		There have arisen fresh interpretations and fresh syntheses , which have the novel merit of rest - ing at every point on a complete and logical substructure .

		In the construction of such an historical edifice , critical judgments , whether moral or artistic , have no place .

		Their place is another and not less honorable one , lying in the realm of ethics or aesthetics , but not of history .

		If the function of the critic , like that of the historian , is understood , it will be recognized that it is safest to practice the two independently , though both may conceiv - ably be practiced by the same person .

		In the study of Gothic architecture an enormous quantity of minute research has already been done .

		Satisfactory interpreta - tions of many of its single phases exist , and possibly the time is ripe for at least a pro- visional synthesis , either historical or critical .

		Such an historical synthesis has been recently attempted , a trifle hastily , by Mr.
Arthur Kingsley Porter	PERSON	in his `` Mediaeval Architec - ture '' ; and something of the sort , written with fuller personal knowledge of the monuments , one might have hoped for in a new book with the title and obvious purpose of Sir
Thomas Jackson	PERSON	's .

		As an alternative possibility , one might hope for a book devoted to artistic interpretation and criticism , likewise presup - posing the establishment of the details of historic fact by others .

		It proves that in
Sir Thomas	LOCATION	's book we have neither of these things in purity , but a mixture of criticism and historical general -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 503 ization , cumbered with a wealth of descriptive detail and of first hand observations on indi - vidual points .

		The author defends himself in his preface against critics who complained that his descriptions in the earlier book were not complete .

		As the material is easily access - ible elsewhere , he would have been wiser to omit detailed descriptions altogether .

		The many fresh points of detail noted in regard to English buildings , on the other hand , might best have formed the subject of treatment in a briefer independent work .

		We might then have had in more convenient compass the admirably clear historical introductions and summaries , or the equally admirable exposi - tion and sane artistic appreciation .

		Freed from his unnecessary burdens , the author might thus have found time to enrich his gen - eralizations by reference to the views of such important writers as Male and Brutails , who seem to have lain outside the field of his reading .

		After allowance has been made for the con - fusion of genres , and the resulting failure to achieve fully the merits of any one , we find , nevertheless , that Sir
Thomas	PERSON	has made notable contributions alike in personal obser - vation of individual facts , in historical inter - pretation , and in artistic criticism .

		The additions to our knowledge of detail fall almost entirely in the field of English Gothic , especially in the numerous cases of buildings with which Sir
Thomas	PERSON	has been profession - ally connected .

		The practical observations on the effects of thrusts by vaults and flying buttresses , the establishment that there is no thrust at certain points , with other well attested conclusions , are corrective of current ideas too hastily adopted .

		In historical interpretation the author ren - ders his greatest service by setting right the question whether a specific structural system is the differentia of Gothic architecture .

		Mr.
Charles H. Moore	PERSON	, the author of the best known general work on Gothic in English , has insisted that the name of Gothic must be confined to buildings showing the system of vaults with balanced thrusts , found especially in the cathedrals of the Ile-de-France .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's emphasis on the existence of a dif - ference in structural principle between such buildings and others , which include the majority of later mediaeval buildings outside of
France	LOCATION	, has been valuable .

		His restriction of the term Gothic to the first group , however , is certainly a wrenching of all usage ; and the contention that the difference in structural system constitutes the chief point of division in the architecture of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	is based on the assumptions of a previous gen - eration , certainly untenable .

		It is as if one were to deny , as
Ferguson	PERSON	did , that lintels and round arches could both belong in the Roman `` style . ''

		All `` this has been repeatedly pointed out by reviewers of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's books , and by writers on English architec - ture ; but the misapprehension can only be finally dislodged by a general book which shall replace Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's as the most authoritative work on the subject in English .

		This Sir
Thomas Jackson	PERSON	has now furnished .

		It is really in the matter of artistic criti - cism , rather than of historical research or interpretation , however , that Sir
Thomas	PERSON	's book makes its chief contribution .

		It is a signal evidence of his continued growth and intellectual hospitality that he is able at his advanced age to voice what one must feel , in most instances , are the critical judgments of the younger generation .

		While it is doubtful whether critical judgments of any generation will ever retain permanent validity , it is pos - sible to believe that the constantly growing catholicity given us by increasing historical understanding of previous ages is really a tendency of progress .

		This tendency Sir
Thomas	PERSON	carries on by his sympathetic treat - ment of long mistreated phases like Italian Gothic , Flamboyant , and Perpendicular .

		In these cases and others , there can be little doubt that he expresses the feelings of a mul - titude .

		With all its catholicity , of course , our age still has its purely intuitive favorites , differing from the favorites of even a few years ago .

		In his choice of these ,
Sir Thomas	LOCATION	is still young .

		Thus , when he prefers the soaring ambition of
Beauvais	PERSON	to the classical perfection of
Amiens	LOCATION	, the gorgeous facade of
Rheims	LOCATION	to the peaceful one of
Paris	LOCATION	, he is expressing that reaction against logic which seems to be the esthetic temper of our own day .

		The publishers have spared no pains to give the work a form which corresponds with the importance of the text .

		Light and fine tex - tured English paper , wide margins , a legible type face and attractive vellum backed bind - ing , with the multitude of excellent half-tones justify the not immoderate price set upon the volumes .

		Personal in its composition of diverse ele - ments and in its assemblage of individual observations ; unnecessarily descriptive at times , yet always readable ; clear and trench - ant in historical exposition , though sometimes less concerned with flux than with static con - ditions , Sir
Thomas Jackson	PERSON	's `` Gothic Architecture '' has yet its greatest value as a representative of our newest critical appre - ciation .

		504 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	THE GREAT SAGA OF
IRELAND	LOCATION	.

		* It is only the apple tree in one 's own back yard that remains neglected .


Ireland	LOCATION	is Eng - land 's back yard .

		Its rich apples of saga and song are left to rot upon the ground unob - served .

		Suppose a thousand-year-old treasure house in
England	LOCATION	had been dug up in
1914	DATE	.

		The world war would not have prevented the monthlies , the weeklies , and even the dailies , from devoting columns to the wonders of by - gone days thus revealed : There would have been pictures of the weapons and of the war chariots which we may imagine dragged into daylight from their long concealment , and there would have been thoughtful speculations upon the kind of people who built this house and laid away these treasures .

		Suppose that not a treasure house but only a poem , another English epic older than the `` Beowulf , '' or another Greek poem resembling the `` Iliad , '' had been discovered .

		Would there not have been intelligent and enthusias - tic discussion of it , and would not by this time books have been written setting forth fresh ideas which the new epic had suggested concerning the life of our ancestors ?

		Why should stories translated from Irish meet with no more attention than if they had been brought out of Egyptian or of Gujerati ?

		The Irishman , with his brothers , the Highlander and the Welshman , is nearer to the Englishman than anybody else .

		Even if English insular habits of thought ostra - cize Irish culture as belonging to the history of another island , no explanation exists for the neglect of Irish literature in the
United States	LOCATION	, where live more people of Irish descent than in
Ireland	LOCATION	itself .

		And yet the publica - tion of
Ireland	LOCATION	's greatest saga , translated by
Miss Faraday	PERSON	, in
1904	DATE	, from the short version has not met with much attention , perhaps partly because the shorter form of the saga is too rugged to be attractive to modern readers .

		The Tain Bo -LRB- pronounced `` thawn bo '' -RRB- , which is now for the first time completely translated from the longer form by Professor
Joseph Dunn	PERSON	of the
Catholic University	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, was actually written down in the manuscripts as we have them about eight hundred years ago .

		It must have been sub - stantially composed fifteen hundred years ago , and the historical events with which it is con - nected must have taken place at the beginning of the Christian Era , when the Irish were not only pagan but were well nigh untouched by * AN ANCIENT IRISH EPIC TALE : TAIN B6 CUALNGE .

		influences from
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The Tain Bo is by several centuries older than the `` Beowulf , '' far older than the oldest German poem , the oldest French epic , or the oldest Norwegian saga .

		It is the most ancient exist - ing literary monument of any of the peoples who dwell this side of the Alps .

		The Tain Bo is not an epic , but rather the materials for an epic .

		Like all the old Irish sagas , it is in prose , with every now and then a poem inserted .

		It is by no means a finished literary whole , even in the sense that we can say of `` Beowulf '' or of the `` Niebelungeii Lied '' or of the `` Song of Roland '' that they are literary wholes .

		It was not written , as these were , by a cultivated artist who retold old hero tales in a skilful way and for a chosen audience .

		In the Tain Bo collected hero tales appear very much in their original form .

		Much of the art which it has is outrageously unlike any literary art with which we are familiar .

		It requires to be thrice translated to become intelligible to a modern reader .

		First , it must be accurately and completely rendered into English .

		This task Professor
Dunn	PERSON	has accomplished in the volume before us .

		Second , someone with a voice and a pres - tige such as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	possessed must advertise it , get it talked about , and make its strange names familiar to readers .

		Finally , it must be explained and illustrated in a hun - dred ways : it must be retold in diluted para - phrases , and perhaps , if fortune smiles , it may serve as the inspiration for a modern poet who shall represent the old and yet be new .

		Professor
Dunn	PERSON	's introduction is so good that one could wish it longer , but he has not thought it right to increase the size of his book .

		He has reserved explanation and com - ment for another volume , which the reader will be glad to note he has in mind .

		Since a relish for story outlines is not com - mon except among college professors and members of Chautauqua circles , no attempt will be made here to tell the story of the Tain Bo .

		Moreover , the plot of the Tain Bo is the simplest thing in the world : a cattle foray , and a war which ensued to recover the stolen herd .

		The people of the Tain Bo were at a ruder stage of culture than the warriors of `` Beowulf . ''

		They had not yet , like the English thanes , learned from
Caesar	PERSON	's legionaries the use of helmet and coat of mail .

		Some of the warriors of the Tain Bo entered the battle stark naked .

		Warfare was con - ducted by a series of single combats between chosen heroes , exactly as in the `` Iliad . ''

		If some time-machine could transport us to the year `` one '' in
Ireland	LOCATION	, we should certainly
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 505 mistake Cuchulinn -LRB- pronounced `` kuhoolin '' -RRB- , fighting from his two-wheeled chariot , guided by a faithful charioteer , for one of the war - riors of Agamemnon .

		The machine gun of the Tain Bo battles was the scythed chariot , which is the same engine of war that is de - scribed for us in the `` Anabasis '' and in the Book of Judges .

		Sisera 's `` nine hundred chariots of iron , '' with which `` he mightily oppressed the children of
Israel	LOCATION	, '' doubtless resembled those with which
Queen Medb	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- pronounced `` mave '' -RRB- broke the line of the men of Ulster .

		In some respects the Irish warriors were at a lower stage of culture than Hector and Achilles .

		Warriors carried about the heads of slain foes attached to their belts , like the Red Indian 's scalps , or stuck them on posts outside the tent door to advertise their prowess .

		Perhaps the ancestors of all
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean peoples passed through such a stage of culture in their struggle through millions of years from the beast up to the man .

		Yet the rough picture of the Tain Bo con - tains glimpses of a certain wholesome kindness and even courtesy which are hard to match in the more advanced civilization of the `` Beowulf '' or even of the `` Iliad . ''

		Evidently the pagan Irish must be likened to children rather than to savages .

		A word led to a blow , to the flash of bloody swords , and then perhaps to a reconciliation and to a kiss for the sur - vivors .

		Some of these bits of chivalry may have been exalted into prominence by those who wrote down the saga in Christian times .

		Cuchulinn and
Ferdiad	ORGANIZATION	.

		sharing each other 's food and medicine in the intervals of deadly conflict , and their charioteers sleeping beside the same fire , may be exceptional .

		But noble traits are clearly inherent in the saga .

		Cuehulinn will not slay women , charioteers , or unarmed men .

		As he is about to cut down Loch , his deadly foe .

		the latter asks that he may be allowed to fall forward with his face towards the enemy , and Cuchulinn grants his prayer .

		`` For 't is a warrior 's request that thou makest . ''

		The King in `` Beowulf '' is descended from the gods , but remotely through several genera - Jions .

		Cuchulinn ?

		s own father was a god , and the divine parent enters one of the conflicts of the Tain Bo to give aid to his son .

		The men of `` Beowulf '' stood in awe of the marvellous monsters with whom they fought , but they were not superstitious about them .

		Beowulf seems to act by the cold light of reason , whereas
Cuchulinn	PERSON	was led by impulse and by supernatural scruples .

		The supernatural pro- hibition geis -LRB- pronounced `` gas '' -RRB- plays an important part in the action of the Tain Bo .

		A warrior must not drive his chariot toward
Tara	PERSON	with the city on his left hand , because that was forbidden by a geis .

		The whole army of Connaught must stop for a day because Cuchulinn had put a geis upon them not to advance till one of their number could make his chariot leap over an oak tree , as
Cuchulinn	ORGANIZATION	had done .

		If the Tain Bo is of great historical and anthropological interest , this is not saying , I hope , that its interest is inhuman .

		It is shot through with coruscating phrases which prove that the fili -LRB- men of letters -RRB- , though they never gained the sustained power necessary to fashion into unity a long artistic work , were masters of many of the details of story telling .

		One of the commonest and most powerful of the narrative devices is the triad arranged in climax , as in the description of the arrival of the hero Cormac : First came a great company of warriors with a powerful man at the head .

		`` Is that Connac yonder ! ''

		all the people asked .

		`` Not he indeed , '' Queen
Medb	ORGANIZATION	made answer .

		Then came a second troop with better armor than the first .

		`` Is yonder man Cormac ? ''

		all and everyone asked .

		`` Xay , verily , that is not he , ''
Medb	ORGANIZATION	made answer .

		Then came the greatest troop of all , and their spears were as long as the pillars of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's house .

		`` Is that Cormac yonder ? ''

		asked all .

		`` Ay !

		It is he this time , ''
Medb	ORGANIZATION	answered .

		The choice and arrangement of words in the Irish narrative are often wholly admirable .

		Thus for example , when
Queen Medb	ORGANIZATION	explains why it took her so long to choose a husband : '' ' I desired , ' she said , ` to wait , for I must have a husband without avarice , without jealousy , and without fear . ' '

		Nor is the Tain Bo as a , whole without a rough sort of unity .

		The reader notes a progress in the series of single combats of which the saga is largely made up .

		They are at first gay and bombastic in their character , but become gloomier in tone , until they cul - minate in the tragic and terrible battle of the closing pages .

		Professor
Dunn	PERSON	has kept his translation readable without sacrificing faithfulness to his original .

		I can not pretend to have com - pared his translation with the twelfth century manuscripts which contain the Irish tale , although this would now be possible , since the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	numbers facsimiles of these famous manuscripts among its treasures .

		I have , however , compared in several places his English with the Gaelic original as printed by
Windisch	PERSON	-LRB-
Irische Texte	ORGANIZATION	,
Extroband	LOCATION	,
Leipzig	LOCATION	,
1905	DATE	-RRB- , and with
Windisch	PERSON	's German version , and have noted no variations worth recording .

		The Tain Bo in its new English dress will find its place on the shelves of every great 506 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	library alongside the ponderous volume of
Windisch	LOCATION	, which it supplements and makes usable for English readers .

		It would seem that every library which includes the epics of
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	should welcome this epic of
Ireland	LOCATION	, and every Irish - man who can afford it should buy the book for himself certainly every Irishman who cares for the wonderful story of his native lan < L

		A XEW HISTORY OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		* In a famous phrase , Brunetiere has defined the essential trait of French literature as the social spirit , One manifestation of this char - acteristic is the undisputed precedence held by the French in the art of giving artistic form to erudition .

		A striking example is the great `` History of
France	LOCATION	, '' published under the general editorship of Professor Lavisse .

		As invaluable as charming to students of his - tory , the work has proved rather too long for the general reader .

		A warm welcome should therefore be extended to a shorter work in this field , modelled on the same lines , to be issued under the direction of M. Funck-Bren - tano .

		The first volume to appear in English -LRB- the second of the series -RRB- is `` The Century of the Renaissance , '' by
M. Batiffol	PERSON	.

		The French title of the complete work , `` L'Histoire de
France	LOCATION	racontee a tous , '' defines its purpose .

		Each volume is the work of a specialist , but the general public is always kept in view .

		If the remaining volumes equal the first in inter - est , the enterprise should be a distinct success .

		Following the custom of
Lavisse 's History	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Batiffol	PERSON	has added much to the charm and vividness of his narrative by the frequent citation of picturesque phrases and charac - teristic comments from the memoirs of con - temporaries , letters of ambassadors , or the utterances of the protagonists themselves .

		Among the latter ,
Henry IV	PERSON	's bons mots naturally hold a prominent place .

		Besieged by partisans demanding vengeance on former enemies just after his accession to the throne , he replied : `` If you said the Lord 's prayer every day with real sincerity , you would not talk as you do . ''

		An effective use of such citation is the title of the first chapter , `` Smoke and Glory of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' borrowed from Commynes , who also observes of the first of the Italian invasions that if it had not proved a disaster from the start the reason was * THE CENTURY OP THE RENAISSANCE .

New York	LOCATION	: G. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		`` because the expedition had been guided by God , and owed but little to the good sense of the leaders . ''


M. Batiffol	PERSON	is not one of those who overestimate the effect of these invasions on the subsequent development of French civilization , and we occasionally feel inclined to wonder whether he has done justice to the influence of Italian culture .

		The history of this period is a most com - plicated one , but the author has succeeded by the suppression or careful choice of detail in giving a picture at once lucid and calculated to make a lasting impression .

		The brief but vivid narrative of great battle scenes and the striking character sketches of the actors in the drama hold the attention of those who seek primarily the panorama of history .

		The reader 's curiosity is whetted by the acquaint - ance thus offered with princes and statesmen , and he follows eagerly the more sober busi - ness of history which explains the milieu and the superficially less imposing problems with which these men had to deal .

		Considerable attention is paid to the devel - opment of the fine art and letters .

		The treat - ment of the latter is perhaps the least satis - factory part of the work .

		One feels , for instance , that scant justice is done
Etienne Dolet	PERSON	, `` a learned printer of
Lyons	PERSON	who was a sceptic and an atheist .

		He printed and hawked heretical books , which led to his being arrested and tried ... The Parlement sent him to the stake . ''

		With that , and a bit of
Calvin	PERSON	's thunder against him , he is dis - missed .

		Again , there does not seem to be suf - ficient recognition of Italian influence in the work of the
Pleiade	LOCATION	.

		We hear nothing of the debt of their manifesto to Italian sources .

		Of the `` Defense et Illustration de la Langue Francaise , '' we read : `` Du Bellay 's ideas .

		.

		were productive of three results : an imitation which grew closer every day , till it amounted almost to plagiarism , of the ancients ; the bestowing of a more and more rigorous clas - sical education on the rising generation ; and a contempt for the so-called barbarous works of the Middle Ages . ''

		The statement of the first result seems unhappy , as the slavish imi - tation of the ancients characterizes especially the earlier work of the
Pleiade	LOCATION	; the second and third seem overstated , as on these points the doctrine of the Pleiade is merely one expression of the humanistic revival .

		The work of the translator is , with a few minor reservations , highly commendable .

		One point that may lead to confusion is the con - stant use of the word `` pounds '' in pecuniary calculations .

		If the original reads `` livres , '' it would perhaps have been better to retain that word with a note explaining the approxi -

		Whatever disappointment there may be on the | part of some , there are others who will be glad of this .

		I should myself think that the book was not a romance , but an extravaganza , of much the same kind as a number of others of the present day .

		I believe ``

		But any attempt to give Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's work a sociological or political character would fail if based on such passages , for they are not many and only show a general common sense applied to domestic affairs .

		I believe one can not recommend Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	to the reader in this case better than as having written an amusing book that seems to have little but its amusingness to recommend it .

		It is a pleasing interlude among the many ferociously serious pieces of fiction of the year , whether that seriousness come from profound studies in sociology or hectic labors of the imagination , whether it be a novel `` that makes one think '' or one that lifts one to undreamed-of heights of shimmering , entran - cing , vital imagination .

		It was cer - tainly a well-imagined opportunity , and Mrs.

		Mrs.

Europe	LOCATION	to spend it .

		That is perhaps a little more probable than that a man should lease a fine old Southern mansion with four extraordinary servants , but in my -LRB- rather limited -RRB- view of the world not much more so .

		Whether more probable or not , it is much less imaginative and more conventional .

		But just as the one conception -LRB- however out of the way -RRB- offered Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	a chance to give the amusing little narration which she liked to imagine , so does this other conception -LRB- how - ever conventional -RRB- give Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	a chance to pour out a rich and varied store of experience and knowledge of life and love and art and human nature , as well as to express all manner of opinions -LRB- mostly satirical -RRB- on 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	subjects which have interested him .

		I believe the most wonderful Bokharan rugs and the most delightful thirteenth-century tapestries have very ordinary stuff for woof -LRB- or perhaps it is the warp I am thinking of -RRB- ; the wonder and the delight come from the lovely stuffs that are so skilfully woven in and out of the commonplace framework .

		So I would not make too much of the framework that Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	sets up , but would give most atten - tion to the vari-colored , glittering , emotional tapestry that he weaves upon it .


Aurelius Goodchild	PERSON	has three lovely daughters , whom he has named after the three Graces ,
Aglaia	LOCATION	,
Euphrosyne	LOCATION	, and
Thalia	LOCATION	.

		It would seem that they should have been named after some of the Muses instead , although it would have been hard to find the right ones ; for the three young ladies , besides being possessed of much personal beauty and charm , had each of them a considerable gift , the one for music , the next for writing , the last for painting .

		They are all , however , of the clever , easy-going , bohemian type not wholly unknown to pre - vious fiction , and live in very desultory fash - ion on the outskirts of a town of the central west .

		Here they get their hundred thousand dollar legacy , and hence their leisurely start for
Europe	LOCATION	takes place .

		What are we to think ?

		Do the three lovely daughters get married ?

		Does
Aurelius Goodchild	PERSON	lose his hundred thousand dollars ?

		Do they finally return to
Zenasville	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	?

		Is there a single reader above the age of twelve who would give or take a bet on the subject ?

		I do not know ; I only know that I guessed right from the outset .

		But what does it matter ?

		The book depends for its interest on its picture of life abroad , chiefly in
Florence	LOCATION	, on its touch - ing upon a hundred things of interest in the current art and life of to-day , and also , if rather less , on some of its characters and on the general impression of life and reality that it gives .

		For however conventional or uncon - ventional the general idea may be , the book certainly gives the impression of reality , and is full of things that -LRB- even with so little know - ledge of circumstances and situation as I have -RRB- one can see are really excellent .

		I do not remember whether Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's book has been pronounced `` gripping '' by com - petent authorities ; it probably has been .

		I think Miss
Juliet Wilbor Tompkins	PERSON	's `` The Seed of the Righteous , '' both in theory and in practice , really takes a good deal of a hold on one , which I take it is the idea that the word `` gripping '' may be supposed to convey .

		From a theoretical standpoint one would say that
Miss Tompkins	PERSON	had a better idea than either Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	or Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	.

		I do not know whether there really are any families left by earnest reformers who have the instinctive idea that to raise money for good works is a normal way of making a living ; but whether there be or not , the situation does present a sentiment widely existent at the present day , a sentiment of mingled fine - ness and blindness , mingled altruism and selfishness , mingled earnestness and conven - tionality .

		And that is a very good thing to base a story on , better , to my mind , than the notion of hiring a house with exceptional ser - vants or that of inheriting wealth and going abroad ; because as one reads on , one continu - ally says to oneself : `` The thing is so , and one can not get away from it . ''

		In fact , one can - not get away from it , because it is meeting one every day :
Burton Crane	PERSON	went off to
Virginia	LOCATION	where his house was ,
Aurelius	PERSON	and his daughters went to
Florence	LOCATION	, but not a day passes that we do not hear from `` causes '' to which we really owe any part of our income from one one-hundredth up to ninety - nine .

		So that is a good starter .

		It has its diffi - culties , however , which come from its excel - lence .

		An idea like Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's ought to carry itself ; it would be ungracious to say that one could not spoil it , but certainly as soon as one gets well into the book one is amused even at the possibilities that come up , let alone at Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's treatment of them .

		An idea like Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's certainly would not carry itself ; but given Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's well-stocked armory of ideas on life ,
Europe	LOCATION	, art , war , love , it does not seem so very difficult to use them in the opportunity which he has made for himself .

		But
Miss Tompkins	PERSON	's idea , instead of making the matter easier , makes it harder .

		Suppose it be true that the organi - zation of altruism as a business leads to ego - tism , that people who are most earnest in the service of others are strangely likely to feel that they have a right to enlist others in the service of themselves , suppose all that to be true , still it is not easy to imagine just the people , just the situations , that will bring out strongly , effectively , poignantly the rights and wrongs of all concerned .

		It is here , and espec - ially in her people , that
Miss Tompkins	PERSON	has been most successful : I do not feel that the young playwright or the practical cousin are much more than lay-figures ; but Mrs.
Gage	PERSON	and her twq daughters are well-conceived , and on them rests the chief burden .

		So the chief work of conceiving before writing is well done .

		There have been those who when they had thought of a good idea and a good name felt that the thing was sub - stantially finished ; and perhaps it was .

		In this case there is much more done : the idea ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 509 the situation , the people , are all there .

		In an oft-quoted remark ,
Tourguenieff	PERSON	said he was sure -LRB- in such a position -RRB- that the people would do interesting things .

		We might well leave Miss
Tompkins	PERSON	here , but it is but right to say that she has carried out her idea -LRB- i.e. j written the book , which some people think an !

		important part of the matter -RRB- with much ; sympathy and much humor .

		I do not make !

		very much of the plot , but that is rather a minor matter ; the rest is quite enough to carry the book * The first thing to be said of `` Captain
Margaret 1	PERSON	' is that it is a story of buccaneer adventure by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	; and so much being said , many will think it enough , and will go to the book to read for themselves .

		But for others it might be added that here we have a tale of how , along about 1710 or so , j Captain
Margaret	PERSON	sailed for the Spanish Main in the `` Broken Heart '' -LRB- with another captain who had been with
Coxon	PERSON	, and I believe
Morgan	PERSON	too , in their campaigns in the Spanish Main -RRB- with the idea that he might do rightly what many had done or were doing wrongly .

		The story tells what happened to him .

		Cap - tain
Cammack	PERSON	was a true prophet when he said : '' He ai n't going to do much on the main , if he 's going to worry all the time about a young lady . ''

		Yet if he failed , it was only as all artists fail , because his conception was too fine for realization .

		So far as the absolute exploits themselves are concerned .

		I confess they remind me of an account of the exploits of Captain Swan of the `` Cygnet , '' of whom it is said : `` The history of their cruise is a history of bold incompetence .

		They landed , and fought , and again landed ; but they got very little save a knowledge of geog - raphy . ''

		And that rather confused impres - sion I take to be `` very like the real , '' as it has been put .

		That , at any rate , I take to be Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's ideas , or one of them , to give us the touch , the feeling , of life .

		Life as they see it at sea , of course , for it all happens on the `` Broken Heart , '' and most of the people are sailors , except for Stukely and his lovely wife .

		Captain
Margaret	PERSON	is really a poet ,
Captain Cammack	ORGANIZATION	is by way of being `` the tarry Buccaneer , '' Olivia is the lovely lady who gives beauty and charm to men 's thoughts .

		And there are others , too , and we have their life bound together with ties of love and self - ishness and indifference and duty , as a novel - ist will see it .

		Being by Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, the book is full of feeling for the beauty and the brutality of life , and the beauty also of sea and land .

		It is not an ordinary story of adventure , or an ordinary story of realism .

		If it were either , I should pick flaws in both .

		But as it is no ordinary story , but instead a poet 's story , I think the best thing to do is to try to look at the thing as he looks at it , and if we can get in our minds even a touch of the love of the picturesque , the realism of beauty in attitude and in act , the tenderness for fool - ishness and wrong , the humor , and the delight at strong action , and the other such things that go to make up Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's view of the world , why , I think we can well enough dis - regard the dotting the i 's and crossing the t 's .

		Ballad criticism In publishing Dr.
S. B. Hustvedt	PERSON	's in the isth monograph on '' Ballad Criticism in centum .


Scandinavia	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the Eighteenth Century , '' the American -
Scandinavian Foundation	ORGANIZATION	has manifested hyphen - ated activity of the kind we like to commend .

		Besides tracing the marked interdependence of ballad criticism in the several countries during the period designated , Dr.
Hustvedt	PERSON	provides us with an instance of the continued relations in schol - arship of the English-speaking and the
Scandina	LOCATION	- vian peoples .

		The standard editions of Danish and British ballads came from the hands of Grundtvig and Child , men who cooperated gener - ously in their monumental labors .

		By peculiar good fortune , Dr.
Hustvedt	PERSON	has received great assis - tance from the respective successors of these two masters from Professor Olrik of the
University of Copenhagen and Professor Kittredge of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He presents adequately the mass of material that his subject involves .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	the advance during the century was more decided .

		At the outset
Addison	PERSON	praised `` Chevy Chase , '' but largely through rules and precedents that he found in the '' ^ neid '' ; while the editor of `` A Collection of Old Ballads , '' `` the first garner of traditional verse issued in English , '' concealed the approba - tion he may have felt behind a mask of levity .

		Even
Percy	PERSON	, supported by the counsel of
Shenstone	LOCATION	, felt it necessary to improve the old pieces .


Kitson	PERSON	and Herd were leaders , however , in an increasing distinction between ballads and other poetry and in a growing reverence for the unchanged text .

		By the end of the century the normal rather than the abnormal attitude was revealed in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's approval of ballad simplicity .

		In
Denmark	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	, though progress was slower , the way was prepared for editions of ballads early in the fol - lowing century .

		Moreover ,
Denmark	LOCATION	had accom - plished far more than
Great Britain	LOCATION	before the opening of the period under consideration .

		Begin - ning with Yedel in
1591	DATE	, Danish scholars had brought together important editions of ballads , and had obtained considerable insight into the nature of the literary type .

		The Danish movement was retarded , however , during the first half of the cen - tury by the opposition of
Holberg	PERSON	, a man who resembled
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	in intellectual eminence 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	and whose conservatism at this point was more effective .

		The influence of Scandinavian scholar - ship upon British decreased during the century because the vernacular was supplanting Latin .

		After
Percy	PERSON	's work , British influence upon the Scandinavian countries increased .

		Lake
Michigan	LOCATION	's Neutral tints and landscapes having wind-swept no striking features appeal only to the educated eye .

		To the discerning they have charms surpassing the beauties of gor - geous sunsets and radiant autumn views .

		Such a lover of nature in her quieter , less obtrusive moods is Mr.
Earl H. Reed	PERSON	, artist with pen and pencil of the sandy stretches running back from the shores of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	.

		His latest book , `` The Dune Country '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- continues the theme of his earlier work , `` The Voices of the Dunes . ''

		Expert with the etching needle and the lead pencil , he intersperses his narrative and descriptive matter with sixty illustrations admirably suggestive of the various aspects of nature , animate and inanimate , that have caught his eye in his study of the region .

		In addition to the endless struggle between shifting sands and a more or less determined vegetation , he gives pictures of the bird life , the animal life , and the human life that he has encountered .

		Among quaint human types reproduced with pen and pencil are
Old Sipes	ORGANIZATION	,
Happy Cal	LOCATION	,
Catfish John	PERSON	,
Doc Looney	PERSON	,
J. Ledyard Symington	PERSON	, and Judge Cassius Blossom .

		Catfish John sells fish on credit to
Dan ' l Smith	PERSON	, an inventor , and waits for his pay until Dan ' l gets the money that 's coming to him from his invention .

		Meanwhile Dan ' l has `` got fat settin ' ` round an ' eatin ' everything in sight . ''


Doc Looney	PERSON	is a `` yarb ` man , '' of moth - eaten appearance and wearing an old pair of smoke-colored spectacles .

		In the general store of a little village somewhere in `` the back country '' our attention is caught by several large boxes of plug tobacco conspicuously placarded , `` Do n't use the nasty stuff . ''

		Under a wall-lamp is another legend , `` This flue do n't smoke , neither should you . ''

		Still other inscriptions there are , as , `` Credit given only on Sundies , when the store is closed , '' and `` Do n't talk about the war it makes me sick . ''

		A philosopher and a sage is
Elihu Baxter Brown	PERSON	, the store-keeper .

		Excellent in its reading matter and its numerous drawings , the book is little short of sumptuous in its plan and execution .

		Present-day I n `` The Twelve Apostolic Types of prototypes of Christian Men '' -LRB- Re veil -RRB- , Mr.
Edward A. George	PERSON	has written an unusual type of religious book which should prove helpful to a large class of readers .

		The twelve apostolic types are presented in the persons of the twelve Apostles .

		The author has gathered in con - venient form all that we know of the careers of these twelve men before and after the brief period of their association with Jesus ; then , without put - ting any undue strain upon the text , he has made of them men of the twentieth century .

		In impetu - ous
Peter	PERSON	, doubting
Thomas	PERSON	, prosaic
Philip	LOCATION	, mystic
Nathaniel	PERSON	,
Matthew	PERSON	the man of affairs , and the rest , we recognize our contemporaries .

		To take the Apostles from their niches in history and art , and to translate them into flesh and blood , was in itself a worthy task ; but Mr.
George	PERSON	's wide experience as a minister and a broad-minded citizen has enabled him to make some very suggestive comment upon the types of men with whom Jesus sur - rounded Himself and to whom he committed His cause .

		His disciples were only average men , and his cause is still in the hands of only average men .

		Association with a man like Jesus was able to transform such humble and unheroic folk as Galilean fishermen and Jewish tax-gatherers into saints and martyrs .

		This transformation of char - acter , still operative to-day , is the real miracle of Christianity , and in this miracle we may all take a part .

		There are many such paragraphs as the following , which contain more help than many a sermon , and enough matter to start the train of profitable reflection : What a mighty power of Christian cooperation trade associations suggest : If Christian business men should unite in Christian work as they unite in finan - cial enterprises , if they should cooperate as Christians as they cooperate as partners , directors and stock - holders , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	would receive fresh efficiency .

		Walking by the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	, Jesus called to His service the brothers fishing in one boat , and then a little further the brothers working in another .

		Can we conceive of
Simon	ORGANIZATION	and
Andrew	PERSON	in the one boat ignorant of or uninterested in the Christianity of
James	LOCATION	and
John	PERSON	in the next ?

		But is this not often the case with us : men in one store knowing nothing of the faith of men in the next , knowing nothing often of the faith of associates at the same desk and behind the same counter ?

		Why should not the apostles of to-day unite in groups of three and four and twelve and one hundred and twenty-five thousand , as business proximity and syndicates bring them together ?

		Why should not Christianity be forwarded in these days by present trios of
Peter	PERSON	,
Janes	PERSON	and
John	PERSON	, partners in business ?

		Humor , the With much truth Mr.
Stephen Devil	PERSON	, and some
Leacock	PERSON	suggests , in his new volume other matters .

		j > uin 3 T ' .

		CIL J B TJ or Essays and Literary Studies -LRB- Lane -RRB- , that for everyday , homely purposes of life the theory of the ludicrous still remains unde - fined even after
Schopenhauer	PERSON	has declared such concepts amusing in which there is a subsumption of a double paradox , or after
Kant	PERSON	has explained that he found everything exciting laughter in which there is a resolution or deliverance of the absolute captive by the finite .

		And so , in the introductory paragraphs of an essay on American humor , Mr.
Leacock	PERSON	endeavors to find a simple definition `` for simple people . ''

		Tracing the development of humor as arising out of the want of harmony among things , he determines upon three stages : the humor of discomfiture and destructiveness , that of the incongruous , and -LRB- the final and highest type -RRB- `` a prolonged and sustained conception of the incongruities of human life itself . ''

		Tested by his own analysis , the humor that pervades Mr.
Leacock	PERSON	's volume as a whole belongs not infre - quently to this last stage .

		In formulating for the college professor a new apologia pro vita sua , there is real pathos in the truths that `` modern scholar -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL oil ship has poked and pried in so many directions , has set itself to be so ultra-rational , so hyper-scep - tical , that now it knows nothing at all , '' and that our studies `` consist only in the long-drawn proof of the futility for the search after knowledge effected by exposing the errors of the past . ''

		And is there not something almost Shavian in the thought that it is the Devil -LRB- or the fear of him , to be more exact -RRB- that for centuries has kept the world straight ?

		`` There he stood for ages a simple and workable basis of human morality ; an admir - able first-hand reason for being good , which needed no ulterior explanation ... Humanity , with the Devil to prod it from behind , moved steadily upwards on the path of moral develop - ment . ''

		More might have been made of the `` new '' movement of to-day which has supplanted him .

		Its supporters , in their preoccupation with being wicked , so wicked , fail to realize that an uncon - scionable interest in morals , bad as well as good , is merely a yielding to the same old-fashioned puritanical instinct which they do all they can to decry .

		Th story of a second Tuskegee .

		In barely a dozen years a Tuskegee graduate regarded by
Booker Washington	LOCATION	as his foremost gradu - ate , has built up at
Utica	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	, a school patterned after that at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, and the only one of such schools for colored youth that can be com - pared with it .

		From an old log cabin in which the school started in
1904	DATE	, it has grown , under its founder 's unremitting efforts , to an institution having thirty-five instructors , more than five hun - dred pupils , fourteen buildings , and seventeen hun - dred acres of land , the entire property being now valued at
$ 160,000	MONEY	and every year increasing in extent and value .

		This is the work of Mr.
William H. Holtzclaw	PERSON	, whose account of the undertaking , and also of his own life , is to be found in `` The Black Man 's Burden '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , a book comparable in character and interest with the autobiographies of
Frederick Douglass	PERSON	and
Booker T.	ORGANIZATION
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Incidentally , too , it gives a near view of the founder of Tuskegee in the daily routine of his administrative task , and conveys some adequate idea of the great work done and still remaining to be done by leaders and educators like
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	and the author of the book himself .

		In literary quality the narrative is a credit to its writer , who on entering Tuskegee could not tell in what country he lived , much less the parts of speech , though he hazarded a guess that these were the lips , teeth , tongue , and throat .

		The volume is well illustrated and has an introduction by Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Essays on artists and thinkers .

		`` Is the Artist a Thinker , and the Thinker an Artist ? ''

		This is the old but ever fascinating problem brought before us by Professor
Louis W. Flaccus	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, in the vivid and thoughtful pages of his book , `` Artists and Thinkers '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The artist as an uncon - scious philosopher , be the medium of his thought sculpture or drama or music , the philosopher as a real creative artist , building like the artist his vision of the world , what conception could be more fruitful for a criticism fallen so often into personalities or mere flamboyant impressionism ?

		So these essays on
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and
Wagner	PERSON	are real intellectual portraits , type-figures relieved against a background rich in allusion , rich in vistas of the whole complex panorama of modern art and thought .

		No less vividly typical are the philoso - phers chosen ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Hegel	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, whose creative self - expressive thought is woven into our very life .

		And best of all , a fine discrimination is sensed in the construction of these essays , distinct - ive in thought and pithy in style .

		One may object that Professor
Flaccus	PERSON	has not impaled his butter - fly , settled the tantalizing question of the bond between Artist and Thinker .

		But after all , such dreadfully definite results are only possible or desirable in the realm of science .

		Modern art , divine philosophy herself in her new robe of Humanism , are at one in rejecting such absolutism .

		Their truth is not finality but the infinite problem , not the dead butterfly , but the living fluttering Psyche .

		Ours too , if like Professor Flaccus we have in us any of the vitality of modern artists and thinkers .

		The Bolivians painted in gloomy colors .

		An interesting and suggestive con - tribution to the study of the popu - lation of the highlands of
Bolivia	LOCATION	is embodied in Dr.
Alexander A. Adams	PERSON	's `` The Plateau Peoples of
South America	LOCATION	: An Essay in Ethnic Psychology '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The sub-title of the book is , however , a misnomer .

		Rather should it be called `` an essay in racial pathology . ''

		After a survey of the climatic , social , and political con - ditions existing in this region , Dr.
Adains	PERSON	advances the somewhat startling thesis that the present in - habitants of the Bolivian plateau are not only incapable of further progress but show marked tendencies toward degeneration .

		The influence of geographic environment , the deadening and stupe - fying effects of the high altitude , the small pro- ductivity of the soil , combined with isolation from the outside world , have brought about a condition of arrested development , at least as regards the Indian population .

		Such seemingly progressive factors of
Bolivia	LOCATION	as her railways , electric trams in the cities , schools , hospitals , etc. , are at best merely incidental rather than fundamental features in the country 's progress .

		The bulk of the popu - lation is quite unaffected by these foreign importa - tions , the trappings of a civilization in which they have neither part nor lot .

		Symptoms of degenera - tion , according to the author , are also present ; the most striking of these are intellectual deficiency , imperfect nutrition , abuse of toxic agents , particu - larly the cocoa leaf , and sexual irregularities .

		Conditions , instead of improving , are growing steadily worse .

		The picture which he draws of the future of
Bolivia	LOCATION	is gloomy in the extreme .

		Dr.
Adams	PERSON	's contentions , though skilfully advanced and buttressed with considerable evidence , are only partially convincing .

		Conditions are really not as parlous in
Bolivia	LOCATION	as he would have us believe .

		The steady economic progress of the country , com - bined with increasing educational facilities and protective legislation for the Indians , must inev - 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 25	DATE	itably tend to raise the status of the population , and in the long run react favorably on the racial stamina of the Bolivians .

		Yet Dr.
Adams	PERSON	's book has a distinct value , if only as an antidote to those hastily written and roseate impressions of
South America	LOCATION	with which we are all too familiar .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		An attractive and practical new school edition of `` The Hudson Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- is in course of publication , nine volumes being now at hand .

		The notes and introductions retain all the valuable features of Dr.
Hudson	PERSON	's work , and have been revised , where necessary , and brought in accord with the latest results of Shakespearean scholar - ship .

		The earlier edition has been tested by so many years of service that a warm welcome for the new series is a foregone conclusion .

		To `` Longmans ' Pocket Library , '' which now contains so much of
William Morris	PERSON	's work in well-printed and inexpensive form , has recently been added `` The Pilgrims of Hope , '' the narrative poem with Socialistic background which
Morris	PERSON	contributed to `` The Commonweal '' in 1885-6 .

		Al - though this poem has long been available in Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's handsome edition , the present reprint should find a wide circle of readers who could not afford the
Mosher	PERSON	volume .

		It has also the advan - tage of including
Morris	PERSON	's stirring `` Chants for Socialists . ''

		The latest of the always welcome special num - bers put forth by `` The International Studio '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is devoted to ``
London	LOCATION	: Old and New . ''

		Its main purpose is `` to picture various aspects of our contemporary
London	LOCATION	.

		.

		through the diverse visions of a number of artists who happen to have found in
London	LOCATION	subjects a pictorial appeal which happily enlists also the topogra - pher 's interest , and to contrast these essentially modern impressions with the views and picturings of the earlier
London	LOCATION	. ''

		This purpose is carried out by means of nearly one hundred and fifty plates -LRB- including eight in color -RRB- , reproduced and printed in irreproachable style .

		A few brief chap - ters of text by Mr.
Malcolm C. Salaman	PERSON	supply a pleasant background of fact and comment .

		Recent additions to the series of `` Oxford Gar - lands , '' so skilfully edited by Mr.
R. M. Leonard	PERSON	, comprise the following : `` Modern Lays and Bal - lads , '' `` Elegies and Epitaphs , '' `` Poems on Ani - mals , '' `` Songs for Music , '' and `` Epigrams . ''

		Particularly welcome is the last-named volume , which gives us a gleaning from the entire field of epigrammatic verse in English , ranging from the honied amatory to the venomous political .

		One would like to fill a page or two with quotations from this delectable little anthology ; but we will content ourselves -LRB- apropos of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's new volume -RRB- with this specimen of
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	's neat wit : A Frenchman , straying into English fields Of letters , seldom has a locus standi .

		Psychologically speaking , the New Criti - cism , the New Poetry , the New Art , of which we are hearing so much , is easily understood .

		It reminds us of a child who , after much listen - ing to the talk of its elders , pulls its mother 's skirt and says : `` But Mamma , I am here too ! ' '

		And the public , which is always tired of hearing Aristides called the just , or Shake - speare the great , is more or less ready to respond to any irreverence .

		`` The aspiring youth who fired the Ephesian dome '' no doubt found a good deal of sympathy in his day .

		People probably wrote to their newspapers saying that they were dead tired of the old marble shack , and that
Diana	PERSON	had no right to a `` dome '' anyhow , because she was merely the Goddess of chaste propriety and as such was entirely out of date in
Ephesus	LOCATION	.

		This last charge is the gravamen , the attack of the modernists on the writers of the preceding epoch .

		They assert that the
Vic	PERSON	- torian age was given over to the domination of Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	, that its literary creations could utter nothing but `` prunes , prisms , and persimmons . ''

		Now there undoubtedly was a general sobering down from the intoxications and riots of the Georgian period .

		The liter - ature which preceded and accompanied the French Revolution was possibly the most world-upsetting that has ever been known .

		Even in politics and social reform , our radi - cals have hardly caught up with
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Malthus	PERSON	,
Godwin	PERSON	, and
Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin	PERSON	.

		And
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and Leopardi could give aces and spades to any modernist and beat him in the revelation of the nudities of human nature .

		Byron was in act and thought and literary production the superman whom
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	has only philosophized about .

		But neverthe - less we think it quite untrue that the
Vic	PERSON	- torian Age was the dull , drab ,
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	domain of propriety which critics have accused it of being .

		Great literature can not exist without the exhibition of the good and evil inherent in humanity ; and as the Victorian Age un - doubtedly produced great literature , it must 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	have dealt with such forces , chief among which are the problems of sex .

		No modern poet has realized more fully than Tennyson the Miltonic law that poetry should be simple , sensuous , and passionate .

		In meaning , music , and picture , he is prevail - ingly sensuous ; and he never hesitates to deal with any subject that would yield him the agitations , clashes , and climaxes of great art .

		His largest poem , `` The Idylls of the King , '' is a tale of adultery , and its central theme is repeated in some of the minor episodes , `` Merlin and
Vivien	PERSON	'' is a study of sexual temptation .

		A great part of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's early work betrays an extreme susceptibility to fem - inine beauty and charm , and a most frank portrayal of these things .

		Very few poets have celebrated so many women , painted from so many different models .

		`` The Sisters '' is a tragic story of betrayal and revenge .

		`` Locksley Hall '' and `` Maud '' were called Byronic in their day , though in each case the passion developed is a thwarted one .

		It must not be forgotten , too , that he stated the whole problem of the intellectual equality of the sexes in `` The Princess . ''

		The modern education of woman owes a good deal to his initiative .

		Tennyson always leans to virtue 's side , but prudery is the last defect of which he can be accused .

		Of prudery there is of course none in
Browning	LOCATION	.

		He is the poet who sympathizes with women , and the one whom women conse - quently take to their hearts .

		He protects the erring woman with his shield , as other poets protect the erring man .

		`` The Ring and the Book '' is one long plea for a tempted woman .

		`` The Statue and the Bust '' is about as abso - lute a statement of the right of passion to have its way as has been put forth by any present-day author .

		And `` A Blot in the ` Scutcheon '' is a pathetic and sympathetic study of a wronged girl .

		So far as we are aware , no recent writer has gone any further in the revelation of sex - uality than
Rossetti	PERSON	in `` The House of Life . ''

		Some of the sonnets of this poem drew forth
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	's puritanical outburst on `` The Fleshly School of Poetry . ''

		The flesh does get about all that is due to it in the poem ; although , on the whole , it is , if any - thing , too subtly spiritual .

		The sex interest is also supreme in several of
Rossetti	PERSON	's ballads .

		The young
Swinburne	PERSON	was a Victorian , and we do not know of any modernist who would not be , in the language of the street , `` a piker '' in sex revolt compared with the author of ``
Laus Veneris	PERSON	, '' the creator of `` Dolores , '' `` Fragoletta , '' and other daughters of joy who put aside `` the lilies and languors of virtue '' for `` the roses and rapture of vice . ''

		Swinburne also gave up a great part of his life to rehabilitating , or rather justifying ,
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	.

		His plays on this sub - ject may pass with `` The Ring and the Book '' as the most extended study of a frail womari in poetry .

		Turning to the novel , we come to
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, who towers over the bad women of that literary form almost as Lady Macbeth and Clytemnestra do over the evil dames of the drama .

		It is true that
Taine	PERSON	depreciates
Becky	PERSON	in comparison with
Valerie Marneffe	PERSON	, and that a good many modern critics would give the palm to
Emma Bovary	PERSON	.

		They are all three as full of original evil as possible ; but for our part , we think that
Becky	PERSON	has more variety of wickedness in her than the other two .

		At any rate , they are all anterior to the art of the modernist , and we fail to see where the latter has improved upon them .

		It was
Thackeray	PERSON	who uttered the plaint about the restrictions which Victorian prudery placed on the novelist ; but in
Blanche Amory	LOCATION	he managed to suggest a good deal of depravity , just as in
Pendennis	LOCATION	's Fanny he developed a good deal of honest though irregular passion .

		Beatrix in `` Esmond '' is a splendid minx .

		Dickens was hardly a sex novelist .

		His outlook on life was too prevailingly comic to take women as seriously as they want to be taken , as indeed they must be taken to pro- duce the greatest effects .

		But has any Rus - sian novelist of them all painted a more tragic and tremendous character of low life than
Nancy	PERSON	in `` Oliver Twist '' ?

		And Little Em ` ly is not all sentimental ; certain scenes in her career are unflinching in their realism and their force .

		Lady Dedlock and
Edith Dombey	PERSON	are more shadowy ; but they show , at least , that
Dickens	PERSON	was not afraid to violate the conventions .

		Passion has never thrilled through any novel as it does through those of Emily and
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	.

		It is true that there is no actual infraction of virtue in their stories .

		But what earthly difference does that make when , in nearly every case , the passion is a prohibited one , and sex attraction is expressed with the utmost poignancy and abandon ?

		In
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 525 `` Wuthering Heights '' especially , the lovers ' spiritual possession of each other makes all matters of the flesh seem shallow and imper - tinent .


George Eliot	PERSON	was perhaps more responsible than any one else for the impression that the atmosphere of Victorian literature was the atmosphere of a
Sunday	DATE	school ; that its novel was the antithesis of the French novel or the earlier English one of Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	.

		She really was a Sunday-school teacher of genius , and she got on the nerves of
William Ernest Henley	PERSON	and other critics , who have for a time written her down in spite of her immense merits .

		Yet , though she preached over vice , she needed vice to spice her novels .

		Hetty falls , and
Maggie Tulliver	PERSON	is tempted .

		To a good many minds , the tri - umph of virtue and the condemnation of sin excuse a good deal of dallying with sin by the way .

		A dozen years or so ago , there was a play , founded on `` Quo Vadis , '' which was immensely popular in this country .

		Clergy - men recommended it to their flocks as a great moral spectacle .

		`` We remember taking a young woman to see it , and , hardened theatre - goer as we were , we sat on pins and needles through some of the scenes .

		We should cer - tainly never have felt , in any company , such a shock to modesty in witnessing `` The School for Scandal , '' for instance .

		However ,
George Eliot	PERSON	's humor and pathos and wisdom are most genuine , and they will finally weigh down her over-much preaching and vivisec - tion of characters .

		Until recently , in
America	LOCATION	, sex problems have hardly entered into our literature .

		The one great exception is `` The Scarlet Letter , '' in which
Hawthorne	PERSON	proved himself a mighty tragedian .

		Puritan as he was , he had an abiding interest in strongly sensuous scenes and characters , as witness
Zenobia	PERSON	in `` The Blithedale Romance . ''


Poe	PERSON	, his rival and opposite , though a Cavalier by temperament and a Greek by instinct , was an absolute Puritan in his literary creations .

		At least he managed to give the effect of chastity or virginal unconsciousness to figures which are projected with the utmost vividness of sen - suous painting .


Herman Melville	PERSON	's `` Typee '' is a sunny , irresponsible picture of sex attrac - tion .

		Most of our older poets and prose writers , moralists or humorists , whichever they were , have taken the sex question as read , and ordered it laid upon the table .

		But the Victorian age in
England	LOCATION	, we think , concerned itself with women , or with the relation between the sexes , more than does any other literature , except perhaps the Shakespearean drama .

		The previous litera - ture of the world dealt overwhelmingly with men .

		Woman was an adjunct , of course , but she was not encouraged to develop any indi - viduality of her own .

		She was to be either an Egeria or a handmaid .

		The Victorian literature changed all that .

		It retired men into the background , and devoted itself very largely to feminine characterizations .

		Nearly every one of its chief poets or novelists ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	, was a Perseus breaking the bonds of Andromeda .

		If the modernists have done very much more salvage of this kind , we are perhaps too `` near blind '' to see it .

		There is a certain type of mind which is always rediscovering the elemental facts of human nature .

		We have no wish to discour - age any
Columbus	LOCATION	of this kind .

		But we would suggest that the differences between the liter - atures of various epochs is more a difference of form than of matter .

		When poetry is dominant , an ideal factor enters into litera - ture , harshnesses are smoothed down , discords are harmonized , and power is subjugated by Beauty .

		When prose rages unchecked , the reportorial instinct is at work , huge chunks of life are flung in our faces , and Beauty is dragged about the stage by the hair of her head .

		We have had many able reporters of life in recent times ; but , for our part , we still continue to prefer the poets .

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I see it stated in some French publications , and the statement has been repeated in at least one American newspaper , that the
United States	LOCATION	has formally adhered to the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	concerning authors ' rights .

		But the first condition of this pact is that each state shall place on precisely the same basis , as far as its international copyright relations are concerned , the status of the books of all other states .

		In this connection , perhaps the best authority on the subject of copyright in the
United States	LOCATION	, Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, says to me : 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	No present action is practicable , and , so far as I know , no action is now in train , in regard to the relations of the
United States	LOCATION	with the
Convention of Berne	ORGANIZATION	.

		As you know , but as these French writers on the subject do not seem to know , under the influ - ence of our protective system and of the labor unions , the copyright law of the
United States	LOCATION	contains a manufacturing provision which declares that no work may secure copyright in our country that has not been entirely manufactured within American terri - tory .

		This provision makes it impracticable for the
United States	LOCATION	to accept membership in the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		The statute which went into force in
July , 1909	DATE	, not only confirms but extends the manu - facturing requirements of the statute of
1891	DATE	, which was the first that accorded copyright to foreigners .

		As long as our nation maintains a protective policy , and as long as our national legislation is largely under the influence of the labor unions , we have no prospect of securing an abolition of the manufacturing condi - tion for copyright .

		It is of course in no way germane to copyright law , but we should have had no interna - tional copyright if we had not been willing to accept this manufacturing condition .

		Mention of Major Putnam reminds me that his house has recently taken over the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can end of the `` Loeb Classical Library , '' and suggests my repeating here two foreign judg - ments , though they be rather severe , on our Latin and Greek scholarship .

		Here is what one of the most thorough British classical scholars wrote me last winter : American scholars seem to me behind English scholars in literary interest in the classics .

		They have , in my judgment but I am much prejudiced in the other direction far too much devoted them - selves to grammatical , technical , and archaeological study ; in fact have taken the German rather than the French or English line .

		To my mind this is a defect , and I think the `` Loeb Classical Library '' ought to do much to remedy it .

		But unhappily , the Library seems to be imperfectly appreciated as yet in
America	LOCATION	.

		And here is what an equally competent French scholar has said to me on this same point : I consider the English work in the `` Loeb Library '' superior to that of the American scholars .

		But Dr. Page and Dr.
Eouse	PERSON	, the editors-in-chief of the enter - prise , take so much trouble with the revision that faulty manuscripts must appear correctly under their guidance .

		A discussion has lately been going on in French literary circles about the effect of the war on periodicals in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		I have a few facts which I can contribute to the question .

		In
Belgium	LOCATION	, for instance , the conflict has caused the entire suppression of the reviews , which were always rather weak , being largely overshadowed by those of
France	LOCATION	.

		But beyond the borders of this unfortunate country some new Belgian periodicals have been founded .

		Thus , at
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- Rue des Colonnes -RRB- is issued the weekly , `` La Patrie Beige '' ; at
Havre	LOCATION	, where the Belgian government sits , appears `` Le XX e Siecle '' ; while the well-known
Brussels	LOCATION	daily , `` L'Independance Beige , '' is now being published at
Tudor House	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		Then there is `` La Belgique Independante , '' a sort of semi-monthly brought out at
Geneva	LOCATION	-LRB- 18 rue du Chene -RRB- , whose editor ,
M. Jean Bary	PERSON	, formerly at the head of the Ghent daily , `` La Flandre Liberale , '' seems to consider it his chief aim at this crisis to throw mud at the Belgian public men without distinction of party .

		But perhaps the most interesting of these Belgian periodicals struggling for an existence on foreign soil is `` La Wallonie , '' whose office is at 14 rue
St. Georges	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and whose editor is
M. Raymond Colleye	PERSON	.

		The purpose of this semi-monthly is to support , as its name would indicate , the French side in
Belgium	LOCATION	, without , however , attacking in any form the Flemish interests of the country .

		By the way , this word `` Wallonie , '' invented in
1884	DATE	by
M. Celestin Demblon	PERSON	, of the Belgian Parliament , became immediately popular , and now seems to have entered into the language of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		It is meant to designate the four and a half Walloon provinces in contradis - tinction to the four and a half Flemish provinces of this same bilingual nation .

		For what I intended to say about the Scan - dinavian reviews , I substitute this extract from a communication which I have just received from
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, written from
Copenhagen	LOCATION	: None of our Scandinavian periodicals have had to suspend publication on account of the war .

		I have not read them all but I know their views .

		In a general way all try to remain neutral and are not disposed to publish articles which clearly or violently attack either side .

		For imports , we depend upon
England	LOCATION	; for exports , we depend upon
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Our sympathies are manifested , but not too directly , in the newspapers rather than in the reviews .

		On account of the war of
1864	DATE	, which robbed
Denmark	LOCATION	of territory , the feeling here in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	is anti- German , and it is especially so because of the brutal way in which the Prussian government treats con - quered Sleswick .

		The Norwegians are for
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	only the socialists are truly neutral , or are friendly to
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	.

		The majority of the nation has very good grounds for hating and fearing
Eussia	LOCATION	, which is a constant threat to her security and which has filled the country with spies .

		The Allies have made a bad impression in
Sweden	LOCATION	as elsewhere by trying to deny that
Eussia	LOCATION	is a menace to liberty not only in
Finland	LOCATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	but everywhere .

		You well know what the average human being is worth .

		They can not think and can - not feel soundly .

		In .


Denmark	LOCATION	prevails a certain fanaticism , too merited alas !

		against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In
Norway	LOCATION	the people are cooler because in a less dan - gerous position .

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	, sentiments are dictated by fear of
Eussia	LOCATION	, the terrible neighbor .

		All this comes out in our Scandinavian periodicals in one shape or another .

		Ultra-Frenchmen have accused
Brandes	PERSON	of being too German and ultra-Germans have accused him of being too French , but the above paragraph shows him holding the bal -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 527 ance rather evenly in these difficult times .

		Spanish periodicals are particularly inter - esting just now for the light which they throw on the efforts of the two belligerent sides to influence neutral public opinion through the printed page .

		In a general way it may be said that the Spanish publications are very much divided in their allegiance .

		Thus , the `` Nuevo Mundo '' gives more space to the cause of the Allies than to that of the
Central Empires	ORGANIZATION	, especially in the articles of that clever writer ,
Gomez de Baquero	PERSON	.

		The illus - trated press is , on the whole , on the side of
England	LOCATION	.

		`` Blanco y Negro '' desires to be considered neutral , but its caricatures and cartoons would find a welcome place in any German magazine , though the articles signed Angel
M. Castell	PERSON	are decidedly favorable to
France	LOCATION	.

		`` A. B. C. , '' which is owned by the same company as `` Blanco y Negro , '' was at first so furiously pro-German that it was not allowed to enter any of the Allied countries .

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' has been very severe on it .

		But to-day it appears to have changed its tactics slightly , and its Germanophile military correspondent has left its staff .

		The `` Illus - tracion Espanola y Americana '' is openly on the side of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The same thing is true of `` El Montidero , '' while `` Espana '' is a friend of
France	LOCATION	.

		In fact , in
Spain	LOCATION	are sev - eral publications which do not try to conceal their propagandist character .

		Thus , on the German side are `` Germania , '' `` El Mundo Ilustrado , '' `` Hamburgo Nachrichten , '' and `` Hojas Devulcadoras , '' which are printed in
Barcelona	LOCATION	or even in
Hamburg	LOCATION	itself .

		The Allies ' organs are `` La Razon , '' `` America Latina , '' `` El Mundo Latino , '' and `` El Bollatin de la Alizanza . ''

		A German watch - maker in
Madrid	LOCATION	named
Coppel	ORGANIZATION	publishes gratis a paper whose very name tells its pur - pose , `` El Propoganda Germanofila . ''

		In this connection , a journalistic friend at
Madrid	LOCATION	writes me : The consulates of the neutral nations are inun - dated with pamphlets and circulars of German origin , and papers of the same sort written in perfect Spanish are handed to passers-by in the streets and left in the churches and public establishments , and sent to convents and schools .

		In a word ,
Germany	LOCATION	is spending millions on propaganda in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		This state of things would seem to give color to a remark attributed to our witty young king when he declared that `` I and the rabble are alone with the Allies . ''

		From
Rome	LOCATION	,
M. Jules Destree	PERSON	writes me that `` in
Italy	LOCATION	the reviews are probably more active than in any other part of
Europe	LOCATION	, and are engaged in publishing articles of the high - est interest '' In fact most of them , with two or three exceptions , such as the `` Rassegna Contemporanea '' which was very feeble before the war came , have continued to appear .

		But they are still very sharply divided on the question which , however , would seem to be settled , of participation or non-participation .

		1 In the latter division belong the `` Revue I Socialiste '' of Signer Turati and the
Naples	LOCATION	I `` Critica , '' edited by the philosopher Bene - < detto
Croce	PERSON	, still an impenitent admirer of ' ,
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The most important of Italian reviews , the `` Nuova Antologia , '' though in this same camp when the hostilities began , is now squarely on the side of the Allies .

		The same is true of the young reviews , as for instance the `` Voce , '' organ of the `` futuri - estes '' both in art and letters .

		Archbishop
Henry Doulcet	PERSON	, who knows his
Rome	LOCATION	as well as he does his
Paris	LOCATION	, writes me as follows on these points : The present state of Italian public opinion is well revealed by the position of the reviews .

		At the same time that we see disappear non-intervention period - icals , we also note the foundation of very solid inter - ventionist periodicals .

		In a word , it may be safely said that the grand majority of the Italian reviews , and especially the younger and more active of them , are squarely of the latter category .

		In
Switzerland	LOCATION	at least one review calls for a word apart .

		`` La Revue Politique Internationale , '' founded at
Paris	LOCATION	in
January , 1914	DATE	, was , when the cloud burst a few weeks later , carried to
Lausanne	LOCATION	, where it is still appearing , and in its pages some of the best periodical literature now being printed in
Europe	LOCATION	is coming out .

		Its energetic and accomplished editor ,
M. Felix Valyi	PERSON	, said to me recently : Our aim is the spreading of scientific internation - alism .

		I myself am more a philosopher than a poli - tician , and my programme is to remove politics from the exclusive influence of the personally ambitious ; and to introduce into its domain those unselfish intel - lectuals who up to the present balk at the idea of associating themselves with politics .

		Something , too , ought perhaps to be said here about the Dutch monthly printed in the French language at
The Hague	LOCATION	, `` La Revue de Hollande , '' whose purpose is to spread French ideas and the French language in the Low Countries and to draw more closely together intellectually the two nations .

		This is the very time for such a periodical to do good work ; but while the editorial side is fairly well conducted , the administrative side is rather weak and inactive , with the result that the review is not at all exerting the influ - ence that it should be exerting .

		It is printed on good paper , in type pleasing to the eye , while the level of the articles is far above that found in the average European monthly ; but somehow it does not appear to prosper .

		Much might be said in this connection con - cerning the periodicals of
France	LOCATION	, but I shall speak briefly only about one of them , 528 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	`` L ` Opinion , '' published at 4 rue Chauveau -
Lagarde	PERSON	.

		The chief founder of this interest - ing weekly was
M. Paul Doumer	PERSON	, `` the Eoosevelt of
France	LOCATION	, '' whose five sons were in the trenches , where one has been killed and two wounded already .

		In shape and spirit this paper somewhat resembles `` The New Kepublic , '' with the saving salt of what the French call the spirituel .

		Since the outbreak of the war one of its strongest features has been the sturdy bold drawings of Forain .

		Its editor ,
M. Maurice Colrat de Montrozier	PERSON	, who has a most pleasant personality and brains that go with it , is a close friend of both the President of the Republic and the President of the Ministry ; so that when the editorial columns speak out , they speak with consider - able authority .

		This periodical and this editor will surely be heard from in a powerful way in the
New France	LOCATION	, especially when the weekly becomes a daily , which I am authorized to say will be the case when the peace comes .

		Another
Paris	LOCATION	daily , `` Le Temps , '' charac - terizes that gifted Nicaraguan , the late
Ruben Dario	PERSON	, as `` the Prince of Hispano-American poets '' ; the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' places at the head of its number for
April 1	DATE	, a very eulogistic article on him from the pen of
Ventura Garcia Calderon	PERSON	; the
New York Hispanic Society	ORGANIZATION	announces a volume of his translated poems to be issued under its aus - pices ; and now
Senor Julio Llanos	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent of the
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	`` Nacion , '' informs the public that he and a little group of friends of the poet are collecting funds with which to raise a monument in his honor in the French capital which he loved so dearly .

		Very timely , therefore , is this note from the young American critic and publisher , Mr.
Robert J. Shores	PERSON	, who presents the poet in a more intimate manner than I have seen him presented elsewhere .

		Speaking of
Dario	PERSON	's sojourn in
New York	LOCATION	during the winter of 1914-15 , Mr.
Shores	PERSON	says : Though I saw
Euben Dario	PERSON	a number of times and talked with him in rather intimate fashion regarding his plans and his work , he was something of an enigma to me .

		In personal appearance he was swarthy , stout , and gave the impression of being a larger man than he really was .

		He was not , in fact , very tall ; but he seemed tall as well as broad .

		He had a very pleasant smile ; but when his face was in repose , he had almost an oriental cast of countenance .

		His head was fine , the sort a sculptor likes ; the sort which looks well upon a medal or coin .


Dario	PERSON	was not sociable .

		He did not like to meet people ; seemed really to be averse to making new acquaint - ances , though he was affable enough when he did meet them .

		In many respects he was like a child ; when he was pleased with anything , he showed his pleasure very plainly .

		He was vain but not conceited ; he did not boast but accepted praise , and even flat - tery , with great equanimity .

		He liked to hear his poetry praised , and on one occasion asked me to read three times a letter which he had received from a lady who admired his poems , and each time he exclaimed , `` That is good for me . ''

		During his stay in
New York	LOCATION	, he complained very much of the cold , and did not like to go out unless the sun was hot .

		He was very remiss in keeping his engagements , and would often telephone at the last moment to say he could not attend a repast given in his honor .

		So when
George Sylvester Viereek	PERSON	invited him to luncheon ,
Dario	PERSON	decided at the eleventh hour that he could not go .

		I telephoned the message to
Viereek	PERSON	, who was not at his office , and two days later he wrote me saying he hoped
Dario	PERSON	had not been disappointed as he -LRB- Viereek -RRB- had quite forgotten to go to the rendez - vous for the luncheon !

		I heard
Dario	PERSON	read in public in Spanish from his poetry .

		He spoke very well and read very effectively .

		While in
New York	LOCATION	he was pre - sented with a silver medal by the
Hispanic Society	ORGANIZATION	, and with an address of honor drawn up by the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Sciences .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE SEARCH FOR THE PERMANENT in these days of demolition and overturn has occupied more than one earnest soul .

		When the bottom seems to be dropping out of everything there is an impera - tive need of something solid to cling to .

		This need , in an intellectual and spiritual sense , is keenly felt by a writer in `` The Unpopular Review '' who , under the heading '' ' Efficiency ' and Efficiency , '' pleads for a return to the ancient classics , to the `` humanities '' as they were culti - vated by our grandfathers in the good old days before the warfare of science with the elder learn - ing .

		Denning humanism as `` the critical study of the experience of man in his search for standards of worth , '' the writer finds no such study more productive of satisfying results than a serious par - suit of the classics .

		But the rare scholar of to-day who pursues the classics for the pure love of it , finds himself suffering a degree of spiritual isola - tion .

		As our courageously `` unpopular '' pleader says of the humanist , `` in the face of a world of things , against those whose god is the science of speed , he alone , as it sometimes seems , upholds the primal gift of man , the power to discriminate and to choose . ''

		To quote further , and without too strict regard to immediate connection : `` Partly because of this natural relation of the ancient writer to his environment , partly because of some - thing which must be set down simply as genius , his work , unlike all but the rarest and least read of contemporary writing , rings true because it comes from the heart and centre of things .

		Though not given to uncharitableness , one can not but find much of even the most able literature of recent years given not to the portrayal of the broadly human , not to the observation of the will in action and the workings of the laws of human nature , but to the exploitation of idiosyncrasy for idiosyn - crasy 's sake .

		This absence of the central , this stress on aimless mood and easy-going sentiment at the expense of character , this failure to dis - criminate among values , is responsible for the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 529 impetus that modern literature has given to our already violent tendency to prefer quantity to quality .

		And it would be a sufficient reason , were there no other , for us to refuse to accept modern literature as an adequate substitute for the classics .

		For , in a word , modern literature , compared with ancient , is a relaxation and a confusion of the spirit rather than a discipline . '

		1 For a real and not a seeming efficiency we are directed back to the study of the classics .

		Ox THE SUBJECT OF CAPITALS certain remarks suggest themselves which may be not out of place here and not too wearisome to the reader .

		An initial capital letter adds dignity and importance to a word .

		Our national legislature we appro - priately call ''
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' not '' congress . ''

		The founder of
Jamestown	LOCATION	is known as
John Smith	PERSON	, not
John smith	PERSON	; and any person who should write `` george
Washington	LOCATION	'' in naming our first Presi - dent would stamp himself as little better than illiterate .

		The accepted library usage of begin - ning with a capital only the first word of a book - title and any proper names in that title is to be commended on the score of economy , if economy in the use of capitals is itself desirable .

		But a title seems to stand out better in large initial letters -LRB- except to the insignificant words like articles and prepositions -RRB- than in small .

		`` All 's Well That Ends Well '' shows itself at once as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's play of that name .

		`` All 's well that ends well '' would at first glance be taken for a popular maxim .

		In the current `` Quarterly '' of the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	are several refer - ences to well-known books and periodicals , the titles of which are printed with a rather puzzling variability in respect to capitals .

		We find Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	's '' Domestic Manners of the Americans , '' but very soon afterward
Dickens	PERSON	's `` American notes , '' and on the next page
Henry James	PERSON	's `` The American scene . ''

		We note also references to `` The
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript , '' `` The dial '' and `` Book review digest . ''

		What is there in the words `` manners '' and `` transcript '' to entitle them to greater honor than the words `` notes , '' `` scene , '' `` dial , '' `` review , '' and `` digest '' ?

		One of our fore - most newspapers aims at consistency in the use of capitals by employing them only -LRB- as is jocu - larly maintained -RRB- to indicate the founder of the journal and the founder of Christianity .

		This is going a little too far , as even the most scrupulous library cataloguer would admit .

		A FOE TO INTELLECTUAL NARROWNESS is a friend to liberal culture .

		This self-evident truth will serve as an introduction to a readable chapter in Mr.
Henry Jones	PERSON	Ford 's recent study -LRB- `` a biographical study '' he calls it on his title-page -RRB- of our present chief magistrate .

		`` Intellectual narrowness , '' Mr.
Ford	PERSON	affirms , `` is his great aver - sion .

		I have heard him describe the class of schol - ars who dwarf themselves by confinement to one subject as ' ignorant specialists . ' ''

		Whatever con - cerns humanity interests this anti-specialist , it seems , `` so that at one sitting at his table , '' con - tinues the author , `` one may hear talk of
Kip	PERSON	ling 's latest poem , of
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's most recent paradox , of football prospects , events in the religious world , the latest limerick , the political myths by which people are imposed upon as regards the nature of our Constitution , the trend of contemporaneous philosophy , personal anecdotes , and interspersed throughout a lot of apposite stories . ''

		As one happy consequence of the above-named Horatian quality -LRB- lively interest in all things human -RRB- , `` he seems to be little or not at all exposed to boredom , and arrives fresh and buoyant at the end of what to most people would be a wearying experience .

		So far from being tired of it all , he may rehearse its humorous phases with dramatic gusto when he gets back to the hearthstone . ''

		Something of Luther 's universality of theme and of interest , as noted in the reformer 's table-talk , would seem to characterize the table-talk of him who is here described .

		THE AMERICAN - SCANDINAVIAN FOUNDATION , established by the late
Niels Poulson	PERSON	in
1911	DATE	, is doing excellent work in spreading the knowledge of North-European culture .

		A mutual understand - ing of national aims and ideals and educational methods is considered essential to friendly relations between nations , and so this organization is a pro- moter of peace as well as of other good things .

		Mr.
Poulson	PERSON	, born in
Denmark	LOCATION	, came as a poor mechanic to this country , amassed a fortune , and devoted half a million of it to the cause here mentioned .

		Dr.
Frederick Lynch	PERSON	is President of the Trustees of the American-Scandinavian Foun - dation , and Dr.
Henry Goddard Leach	PERSON	is Secre - tary .

		Associates now number more than four thousand ; a bi-monthly magazine , '' The American - Scandinavian Review , '' has been published by the society since
January , 1913	DATE	; two series of books , a set of translations from the Swedish classics , and one of monographs by Scandinavian scholars , are now in process of publication ; and fellowships have been founded to enable Scandinavian students to take courses in our universities and technical schools , and American students to do the same in Scandinavian institutions of learning .

		As is ex - plained by a writer in `` The Independent , '' to whom acknowledgment is due for these facts , `` the propaganda conducted by The American-Scandi - navian Foundation in the
United States	LOCATION	is consist - ent at every point with loyal Americanism .

		Even when exhorting descendants of Scandinavians to keep alive in English dress their inherited tradi - tions of art and literature , this
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	is not encouraging the perpetuation of alien groups within our midst , but rather is aiding these children of
Northern	ORGANIZATION	stock to assimilate and to support with their high idealism the principles of American liberty . ''

		EX-PRESIDENT
DWIGHT	PERSON	, who died
May 26	DATE	, in his eighty-eighth year , almost seventeen years after resigning that administrative control of
Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity in which the institution gained in material resources more than it had gained during all the previous century and three-quarters -LRB- and a decade -RRB- of its existence , came to his high office 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	eminently fitted for it by both inheritance and training .

		His grandfather ,
Timothy Dwight	PERSON	, had been president of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	from
1795	DATE	to
1817	DATE	, and both grandfather and grandson fulfilled the estab - lished tradition by passing from the pulpit to the presidential chair ; that is , both wore the cloth with - out which , in the old times , no one could be con - sidered an eligible candidate for the headship of the college founded especially for the education of future ministers of religion .

		The later
Dwight	PERSON	is to be credited with raising
Yale	ORGANIZATION	to the rank of a university , though he opposed with unyielding conservatism the modern elective system of under - graduate studies and also , as was to have been expected as well as desired , the increasing inroads of athletics upon the time and energies of the student body .


Timothy Dwight	PERSON	, the second , was born at
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
Nov. 16 , 1828	DATE	; was educated at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Bonn	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, and at the
Yale Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	; taught sacred literature and New Testament Greek in the latter school from
1858	DATE	to
1886	DATE	, when he was chosen president of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, con - tinuing in office until
1899	DATE	.

		He was a member of the American committee for revising the English version of the Bible , and was the editor and annotator of various commentaries on parts of the
Bible	LOCATION	, also author of `` Thoughts of and for the Inner Life '' -LRB- a collection of sermons -RRB- and `` Mem - ories of
Yale Life	ORGANIZATION	and Men . ''

		WHAT SHAKESPEARE THINKS OF HIS PLAYS , if he be still in some state of being that renders him capable of thought , must have been the query of many and many a reader of those plays .

		A Japa - nese
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	scholar has put into words what may be the present opinion held by the actor - playwright from
Stratford	LOCATION	concerning his work .

		`` A Shakespeare Soliloquy , '' by Professor
W. Asano	PERSON	, is printed in English in `` The Far East '' of
April 22	DATE	.

		`` I feel ashamed in heart , '' the poet is represented as saying , `` to think that there are many persons who talk of me in high terms , call - ing me a genius or even a second creator .

		It is clear to me that every work of mine is full of faults and drawbacks which I desire to correct .

		The first thing to explain is that I was a very busy person , to whom the luxury was not permitted of writing in a clean , quiet study , as you enjoy it , but on a contrary , irregularity was the rule with me , for I had to give up my work for the present , after writing in a hurry five or six lines in a noisy place behind the stage , or I ran the pen on twenty or thirty pages with an aching head after coming back drunken late at night from roystering .

		It was really beyond description how irregular it was . ''

		There is more in the same vein , illustrating the abashed sense of failure , or of something very like it , with which the really great artist must , oftener than not , survey the work of his hand , overcome with dismay at the inferiority of his accomplishment to his ideal .

		Shakespeare might not be moved to express himself in an idiom savoring of
Tokyo	LOCATION	rather than of
London	LOCATION	, but in substance he might well have such thoughts as are ascribed to him by this Japanese writer .

		AN EVENING CONTINUATION SCHOOL , though not under that name , is conducted by every public library that keeps its reading-room open after the customary hours of daily work .

		Especially may the young people 's room be regarded as such a school , giving to the boy and girl whose formal schooling has ended early a chance to keep alive the intellectual curiosity aroused in the classroom .

		The librarian at
Manchester	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, reports on the results of opening , three evenings in the week , the lately established department for young read - ers in that city , saying that it has been difficult to maintain the service with the present staff , and adding : '' We believe it desirable to have the room open every evening from six to nine .

		There are a good many boys and girls who leave school and go to work as soon as the law allows .

		In most cases such young people are not sufficiently devel - oped mentally to find suitable reading in the adult department .

		They constitute a class which greatly needs to continue its education .

		The city has thought it worth while for the good of society to educate these children thus far .

		It is just as truly for the economic good of society that their educa - tion should be continued in order that they may become intelligent and enlightened citizens .

		This is the function of the library .

		The public library , is a continuation school and a recreation field in one , and these young people should be attracted to the library and directed in recreative and help - ful reading in such a way as to influence their lives and make them better citizens . ''

		In all this there may be some inevitable admixture of plati - tude , but the platitude has its uses no less than the paradox .

		A MUCH-QUOTED JUVENILE CLASSIC was the other day cleverly drawn upon to point his moral by President
Wilson	PERSON	in a speech at the
National Press Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Emphasizing the necessity of rapid forward motion on the part of all who would not be left behind as hopelessly unprogressive , he said : '' You will remember the Red Queen in ' Alice in Won - derland ' or ' Alice through the Looking-Glass ' I forget which , it has been so long since I read them who takes
Alice	PERSON	by the hand and they rush along at a great pace , and when they stop
Alice	PERSON	looks around and says : ` But we are just where we were when we started . ' '

		Yes , ' says the Red Queen , ' you have to run twice as fast as that to get anywhere else . ' ''

		Remarkably near to the words of the original does the speaker here come in his impromptu quotation ; but for the benefit of those who , like him , are a little rusty in their Alice books , but who are in the habit of quoting snatches from their entrancing pages , it may be well to point out that the queens and the kings who figure in
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	's whimsical narrative are , in one book , characters from our familiar playing-cards , and , in the other , personages from the noble game of chess .

		It is `` Alice 's Adventurers in Wonder - land '' that has the card characters , while `` Through the Looking-Glass '' is diversified with the chess pieces .

		The Red Queen is , obviously , a chess char - acter , and so belongs in the looking-glass story ; the corresponding royal personage in the other tale is the
Queen of Hearts	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is manifestly very
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 531 important to remember ; for to be caught mining \ up these two royalties would be hardly less humil - iating than , for example , to assign Hecuba to the `` Odyssey '' and
Penelope	PERSON	to the `` Iliad , '' or to make
Sarah	PERSON	the wife of
Elkanah	PERSON	and
Hannah	PERSON	the wife of Abraham .

		* UNIONIZED AUTHORSHIP certainly has at first a rather queer sound .

		To think of the enamoured architect of airy rhyme as belonging to Local No .

		so-and-so of the Federated Quill-drivers of Amer - ica gives one a sort of shock .

		Apostles of litera - ture and art , ministers of religion , benefactors who give their lives to philanthropy all these we like to picture to ourselves as raised far above such sordid considerations as must of necessity influence to some extent those who band themselves together in a trades-union .

		And so when we hear of the steps recently taken by the Council of the j Authors ' League of
America	LOCATION	toward affiliating that j body with the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, we j are not exactly displeased to note , in the list of those writers favoring the move , blank spaces for certain of our best-loved living American authors .

		Possibly their failure to participate in these I momentous proceedings was due to nothing but a missed train , or a mislaid umbrella , or a fit of indigestion , or a previous engagement to play auc - tion bridge , or a too great absorption in a current novel ; but we are not averse to imagining other - wise .

		Some comfort we derive , too , from the announcement that it is not so much the poets and the philosophers who demand trades-union pro- tection of their rights as laborers for hire , as it is the makers of plays for the moving-picture pro- ducers .

		It is possible , in fact highly probable , that the best of what is being thought and said and written in this world of ours will still escape the withering blight of commercialism .

		THE USEFUL ART OP `` CUMULATION , '' carried so nearly to perfection by the publishers of the useful `` Cumulative Index , '' indispensable to research workers in periodical literature , is also turned to good accou8 | in other quarters .

		A late illustration of its value is furnished by the public library of
Cleveland	LOCATION	in its cumulated annual edition of `` The Open Shelf , '' wherein the successive monthly issues of that publication have been combined in a classified and alphabetically arranged list of acces - sions to the library for the year
1915	DATE	.

		An author - and-title index is appended .

		As the compiler points out , `` nearly every title listed is followed by a note giving considerable information in the briefest possible space .

		These notes are intended to do any or all of the following things : To describe the scope and contents of the book , to mention its distinctive points of merit and less often its shortcomings , and to compare it with other books on the same subject .

		Many of the critical judgments in the notes are quoted from authorities like the Dial ,
Nation	ORGANIZATION	,
Athenaeum	LOCATION	, etc. ; unaccredited verdicts are usually those of
Cleve	PERSON	- land Public Library staff readers . ''

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		^ THE NEGEO IN LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The interesting article in your issue of
May 11	DATE	on `` The Negro in American Fiction '' impels me to offer some comments on the negro in literature .

		I agree with Mr.
Brawley	PERSON	that the possibilities of the negro as literary material have by no means been exhausted , though I think the American peo - ple have botched the question of what to do with him considerably less in their books than in actual life .

		In general , we may say that the negro as a comic character has been adequately presented .

		Enough has been made of him , too , as a sentimental character ; indeed , it has often been asserted that the sentimentality and pathos of the negro shown in Foster 's songs and similar works distort and falsify his nature .

		The question then arises whether the negro as a tragic character has been sufficiently regarded .

		I think he has not .

		The theme has not been neglected -LRB- witness , for example , the somewhat melodramatic but sincere and im - pressive story `` The Mulatto , '' by Mr.
Don Marquis	PERSON	, in the
April	DATE	`` Harper 's '' -RRB- , but it has not been presented with anything approaching finality .

		The negro in comic or sentimental aspects rollicks or sniffles through countless pages ; the negro in his tragic aspects has been portrayed rarely , and then in half-hearted or else exaggerated ways .

		At this juncture we are confronted with the question whether the negro is suited to tragedy .

		The question is perhaps debatable .

		At the outset let me confess that , like nearly everyone who writes about the race problem , I personally know little about negroes .

		Though I have lived in the South almost all my life , I did not have any inti - mate contact with negroes during those formative years when one 's powers of observation are so keen and so active .

		Hence my ideas are to be dis - counted , like those of anyone else who proceeds mainly upon theory .

		I have talked over the very question we are here discussing with
Southern	ORGANIZATION	college men whose opportunities to know have been better than mine , and I am fain to acknowl - edge that they do not think as I do .

		The negro , most of them say , is light-hearted , irresponsible , careless ; he lives in the present , like a child or a beast ; he does not aim high or persist ; he is fond of big words and gay colors ; he wants to strut , to display himself , rather than to be ; and therefore , seen against the background -LRB- or the foreground , if you will -RRB- of a civilization which he apes with fantastic imitation , he is a subject for comedy , not for tragedy .

		While I have no conscious prejudice against the negro , I am forced to admit that there is much to justify such a view .

		In my opinion , however , it makes too much of shortcomings and not enough of merits .

		But whether it is sound or unsound , it is not con - clusive in regard to our question ; for if we cut deeply we shall see that it takes into consideration only the average negro , whereas the average man of whatsoever color does not lend himself readily to tragedy .

		The tragic hero has been through the ages a person of exalted qualities and usually of 532 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	world eminence .

		To be sure , we are paying more attention nowadays to exalted qualities in everyday humanity , but we shall probably never make it our custom to cull tragic heroes from the ranks .

		We turn instinctively to the exceptional man .

		Now surely among people of dark skins there are excep - tional beings of both sexes whose positions are tremendously tragic .

		Think of the negro of good education , artistic sensibilities , or high social pur - pose who never gets away from his origin , who meets galling rebuffs from the whites in all sec - tions of the country , and is scorned or suspected by his own people !

		Possibility enough for tragedy there !

		Booker
Washington	LOCATION	without his poise and persistent optimism would have been the protago - nist of a tragedy unspeakable .

		There must be thousands like him except that they do not pos - sess his saving qualities for temperament .

		Is it not a mere question of time until a tragedy thus inherent and inevitable shall find expression through someone with insight to read it truly and with genius to set it forth artistically ?

		So much for the question as to what may be done with the negro in literature .

		What shall we say on the question as to what the negro , in litera - ture , may do for himself ?

		The idea has grown upon me that some day the colore4 race will pro- duce a great lyric poet .

		Negroes are assuredly emotional , possibly the most emotional people the world has known .

		Moreover , they have an ele - mental freshness in their point of view and in their feeling for words ; they have an extraordinary knack for brushing refinements aside , thrusting to the heart of the matter , and crystallizing its essence in picturesque language .

		These are the qualities that make lyric poetry .

		Cultivation and conscious skill may add something , sophistication nothing .

		Already lyric poets of negro birth have been near enough to the heart of their race to sing broken snatches of the music that is resident there .

		May we not hope they are only an earnest of the inspired singer who is yet to come ?

		The time of his appearance among us , it would be hazardous to prophesy .

		Possibly he will be in our midst to-morrow ; possibly not until centuries have passed .

		We can afford to be patient .

		HOMER IN ENGLISH HEXAMETERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		No modern language , I believe , has to its credit or discredit as many translations of the Homeric poems as ours : at the mere mention of the `` Iliad , '' the names of
Chapman	PERSON	and Pope , of
Cowper	PERSON	and
Bryant	PERSON	, will immediately occur to all lovers of the classics .

		It would be too much to say that the work of these and other men has been an utter failure ; yet it can hardly be denied that none of these versions , despite great individual merits , has succeeded in winning anything like general ac - ceptance from the English-speaking world .

		The reasons for this deplorable fact are plainly set down in
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's famous lectures `` On Translating Homer '' ; they are not the same for any two of the works mentioned , but there is one criticism which applies to them all : the transla - tor 's choice of metre and a number have been tried was such as to preclude him from achiev - ing the right Homeric flavor .

		Having clearly exposed the inevitable shortcomings of nearly every other verse-form , Arnold then proceeds , with what seems to me admirable force and effective - ness , to state the obvious arguments in favor of the hexameter as the desirable medium for ren - dering Homer .

		The question naturally arises why no one has as yet attempted a hexameter translation in all the years that have elapsed since
Chapman	PERSON	's day .

		I believe there are two principal reasons .

		In the first place , modern English is unques - tionably a very refractory language for the com - position of dactylic verse -LRB- it is significant that
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, who tried everything else , never attempted it -RRB- because the vast body of the poetical vocabulary of our speech is mono - syllabic or at best disyllabic , and because far more than half of our verse is iambic in move - ment , that is , begins with unstressed syllables .

		From these circumstances it follows that we must lay down certain simple rules for the English hexameter , which my own experience leads me to formulate as follows : 1 .

		Each verse must begin with a strong accent .

		This rule is repeatedly violated by
Arnold	LOCATION	, thus : Between that and the ships , the
Trojans	ORGANIZATION	' numerous fires .

		2 .

		Each verse must read itself , its rhythmic flow dare not be ambiguous , or we are reduced to rhythmic prose : And yet not that grief , which then will be , of the Trojans .

		3 .

		Homer uses a spondaic fifth foot in about four lines to the hundred ; in view of the difficulty of producing anything like a genuine spondee in English , we shall do well to limit that number still more , and to put only our best spondees in that foot .

		Failure to observe this rule is the chief fault of Dr.
Rouse	PERSON	, whose verse in the main represents a distinct advance over
Arnold	LOCATION	: So he rejoicing goes in the light of a larger wisdom .

		4 .

		Similarly , the English verse can not digest more than two successive spondees , hence the bad effect of For than man , indeed , there breathes no wretcheder creature .

		It would perhaps not be surprising if
Arnold	LOCATION	's own verses , halting and unmelodious as they are , had discouraged those to whom his theoretical argu - ments seemed to be well taken .

		But there is another and more important reason why the hexameter has so far not been attempted on any large scale : it is the frequently iterated dictum that the hexameter in English does not even suggest the classic rhythm except to the clas - sically trained , and these it offends .

		The same argu - ment , let me remark in passing , would logically lead to the rejection of any modern metre for the translation of any classical one : for the English trochee is not a Greek trochee , and so on down the list .

		But I believe that the differences between
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 533 the classical and the modern metres have been very greatly exaggerated .

		There is a steadily growing body of evidence to support the theory , which has been advanced in some quarters , that the Homeric verses were not read , in our modern sense , but sung .

		Dr.
Rouse	PERSON	alludes to the recitation of the Vedic hymns , which like Greek have both quantity and musical accent ; this recitation has been handed down by immemorial tradition , and he says , `` It is a sort of intoned recitative , most impressive and agreeable to the sensitive ear . ''

		If this is compar - able to the delivery of the Homeric verses , it fol - lows that when we contrast the movement of a modern with that of a Greek hexameter , we are simply proving the inequality of a spoken verse and a chanted one .

		But it would be fruitless to dwell on this some - what contentious matter , since for my feeling the point is not at all whether an English hexameter is the equivalent of a Greek one .

		It represents in any case , rhythmically considered , the closest approximation to it of which our speech is capable , and it seems to me that there are only two ques - tions which we need to ask about it : first , is the dactylic hexameter a priori adequate for the ren - dering of Homer ; and second , is it in practice capable of producing satisfactory English verse ?

		For we must always be mindful of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's first rule for a translator : `` Thou shalt not turn a good poem into a bad one . ''

		Now , there is much bad hexameter verse in English , and I confess that I had grave doubts as to the capacities of our language in that direction , especially in view of
Arnold	LOCATION	's unsatisfactory verses , until a friend called my attention to
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Andromeda , '' a truly beautiful epic poem which seems to me to banish all doubt of the possibility of creating admirable English hexameters .

		With regard to theoretical adequacy of the hexameter as a medium for translating Homer , I am con - tent to cite
Arnold	LOCATION	's masterly discussion of that question , which he answers with an emphatic affirmative .

		But poetry is in one respect like pudding : if the proof of the one is in the eating , the proof of the other is in the reading of it ; and I am so bold as to append here three short passages from the first book of the `` Iliad , '' which I have recently done into hexameters .

		148 Darkling eyed him Achilles , the fleet of foot , and retorted , `` Woe , thou king that art clothed in insolence , crafty of counsel , How may a man of the Danaans heartily hark to thy bidding , Whether to go on a foray , or to fight with the foe in the forefront ?

		Xot for revenge on the Trojan spearman journeyed I hither , Ready to fight , for they have not wronged me ; neither my cattle Drove they away , nor my horses , nor ever have harried my harvest Yonder in rich-soiled
Phthia	LOCATION	, the land that nour - ishes heroes , Seeing there lieth much distance beween , here shadowy mountains , There the resounding sea : nay , thee we fol - lowed , O shameless , Tnee , thou dog-face , hither to make thee glad by obtaining Quittance for thee at the Trojans ' hands , and for thy
Menelaus	PERSON	.

		458 Now having prayed and sprinkled the barley , they went to the victims , Drew up their heads and slaughtered and flayed them , and took each thigh-piece , Folded it double with fat , and laid raw collops upon it .

		Fagots consumed the flesh , and of gleaming wine a libation Made the old man ; and five-tined forks held the young men beside him .

		Now when the thighs had been burnt , and when they had tasted the vitals , All the remainder they sliced and spitted and carefully roasted , Drawing it then from the fire .

		And when they had rest from their labors , Having prepared the repast , they feasted ; the banquet was goodly , Nor was their pleasure stinted .

		But when their desire was accomplished , Sated with eating and drinking , the young men poured to o'erflowing Wine in the bowls , whence they filled all the cups for libation and feasting .

		Thus through the livelong day they worshipped the god with their music , Hymning the praise of Apollo : his heart was rejoiced as he heard it .

		586 `` Courage , mother ef mine , and endure , howso - e'er thou art angered , Lest I behold thee , dear as thou art , undergoing chastisement Under my very eyes ; nor then , for all of my sorrow , Shall I be able to save thee : for Zeus is not good to encounter .

		Yea , one day heretofore , when I fain would have saved thee , he caught me Fast by the foot and flung me afar from the heavenly threshold ; All day long did I fly , and at sunset I fell upon Lemnos Barely alive , and the Sintians forthwith nursed me , the fallen . ''

		Thus he spake , and the ox-yed goddess , the white-armed
Hera	LOCATION	, Smiled and accepted the cup from the hand of Hephaestus .

		And ladling Nectar sweet from the bowl , from the right to the left did he serve them , Filling the cups ; and the blest gods shook with unquenchable laughter , Seeing the limping Hephaestus puff through the halls of the palace .

		Thus through the livelong day did they feast till the sun was descending , Nor were they stinted in heart as to joy of the bountiful banquet , Nor of the lovely lyre in the fingers of Phoebus Apollo , Nor of the Muses , singing in turn with their beauteous voices .

		It is my wish to complete a hexameter trans - lation of the entire `` Iliad '' and `` Odyssey . ''

		How - ever , I should not proceed with this arduous task 534 THE DIAL -LSB-

		NEW `` OLD '' POETEY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The old order changeth .

		It always has , and probably always will .

		But no word that even ap - proaches the authority of this declares change to be always for the better or for the good .

		Just now , in poetry , the old order appears to be chang - ing , or , as many a soul dedicated to vers libre affirms , has already changed .

		If the change shall prove good remains to be seen .

		The sole judge is Time .

		One thing , however , is certain .

		A wise man never accepts affirmation for proof ; least of all when the delicate truths of art are hanging in the balance .

		Those truths are too sacred , as well as too delicate .

		Poetry , like every other form of art , and like the memory of man upon the earth , is chiefly mortal ; but now and then it is eternal , at least it is so , under time , as Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	says .

		Year on year sees reams of poetry die ; but cen - turies own to the ever-deepening life of such as
Milton	LOCATION	's `` Avenge , Lord !

		thy slaughtered Saints . ''

		Why is this so ?

		Attempts to answer the ques - tion form no small part of the whole stock in trade of the teaching profession .

		Then heaven forbid and it does that the question be answered !

		Again , the efforts to separate at birth the sheep of poetry from the goats is the breath in critic nos - trils , another occupation , or profession , capable of noble practice , though often followed ignobly .

		But how about those who neither criticize nor teach , ` those to whom poetry is truly `` the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge , '' those to whom `` it is indeed something divine '' ?

		They , too , must have their place in the sun of genius , even though the teaching of genius , the emanations of which are '' beauty , be unknown to them , and the vivisection of beauty be blasphemy , those happy creatures who love poetry but have never heard a lecture on it .

		Because I believe in the utter truth of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's observation that the more there are to share a good the more of that good there is , for this reason I am eager to have printed , where many will see it , on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, a poem by Lord Crewe , whose son-in-law , Captain the Hon.
A. E. B. O'Neill	PERSON	,
M. P.	PERSON	, was killed in action in
November , 1914	DATE	.

		The poem appeared in `` The Harrovian , '' the
Harrow School	ORGANIZATION	magazine , and was reprinted in the weekly edition of the Lon - don `` Times '' in
March , 1915	DATE	.

		It will comfort all those who , by nature and custom , are averse to what is called `` new '' poetry .

		It will reassure those whose lot is .

		still more unhappy because they weep the present as an age without poetry .

		To all those who consciously or unconsciously accept
Shelley	PERSON	's definition of poetry as being that which `` makes immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the world , '' this poem will come as a welcome boon .

		It is war poetry ; it is the poetry of faith .

		In form it is both old and beautiful ; in tissue , fresh as dawn ; in wisdom , profound ; in humanity , exalted .

		It proclaims the perfect freedom of the artist , the teller of truth in guise of beauty , who sets and keeps bounds .

		It speaks -LRB- and herein lies its poetic value -RRB- for those to whom reality has been both dear and sad , and no less for the many who have the heart to sympa - thize with , and the soul to imagine , such reality , though fortune has spared them the experience .

		Here in the marshland , past the battered bridge , One of a hundred grains untimely sown , Here , with his comrades of the hard-won ridge He rests , unknown .

		His horoscope had seemediso plainly drawn School triumphs , earned apace in work and play ; Friendships at will ; then love 's delightful dawn And mellowing day .

		Home fostering hope ; some service to the State ; Benignant age : then the long tryst to keep Where in the yew-tree shadow congregate His fathers sleep .

		Was here the one thing needful to distill From life 's alembic , through this holier fate , The man 's essential soul , the hero will ?

		We ask ; and wait .

		SHAKESPEAEE IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The international sympathy and cosmopolitan spirit of the Japanese are well evidenced in edu - cation and literature .

		The Fifth Article of the late Emperor 's `` Charter Oath , '' taken in
1869	DATE	, read as follows : `` Wisdom and ability should be sought after in all quarters of the world for the purpose of firmly establishing the foundation of the Empire . ''

		And ever since that time the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese have been earnestly seeking for wisdom and ability , and have assimilated foreign learning and literature into the Japanese spirit .

		It is therefore no wonder that the Japanese desired to take an active part in the celebration of the
Shakespeare Tercentenary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original plans for such a celebration could not be carried out in their entirety , because it was impossible to secure the Imperial Theatre at the proper time .

		But the authorities of
Waseda University	ORGANIZATION	, under the lead - ership of Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	, the greatest
Shakespear	PERSON	- ean scholar in
Japan	LOCATION	, were able to carry out , on a somewhat smaller scale , a celebration which reflected great honor upon Japanese interest in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and their ability to represent him to their people .

		There is scarcely space to go into the details of the celebration at
Waseda	LOCATION	on
April 22	DATE	and 23 ; but the following were the principal features of the programme .

		There was an exhibition of Shake - speareana , consisting of books , pictures , and other mementoes .

		There were lectures on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and memorial services , followed by a memorial dinner .

		On the
evening	TIME	of
April 22	DATE	, a
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 535 few scenes from ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' were presented in Japanese ; and on the following evening scenes from both ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' and `` Midsummer Night 's Dream '' were presented in English .

		I can not refrain from mentioning one incident of the celebration , although it may not seem exactly in harmony with the dignity of the occa - sion .

		A Japanese friend of mine has a neighbor who is afflicted with deafness and a tendency to conviviality .

		On the
morning	TIME	' of
April 23	DATE	this man gathered a few friends in his house and loudly informed them that the day was a Shakespeare anniversary , and that , as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was a very famous man , it was right to drink much sake in his honor !

		Then they celebrated in true Fal - staffian style .

		This incident at least shows the intensity of the Japanese admiration of Shake - speare .

		I must not omit to add that the current maga - zines are properly celebrating the anniversary , either by scattering articles on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	through several numbers or by getting out special
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	numbers .

		Even the moving picture shows must fall into line , and are presenting `` Hamlet '' as interpreted by Sir
Forbes Robertson	PERSON	.

		And the English and Americans in
Tokyo	LOCATION	and
Yokohama	LOCATION	, not to be outdone by the Japanese , are now engaged in practicing for a presentation of `` A
Winter	DATE	Tale , to be given on
May 29	DATE	, 30 , and 31 , at the Imperial Theatre ,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, by the
Ama	ORGANIZATION	- teur
Dramatic Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some notes dealing with the question as to how Shakespeare came to
Japan	LOCATION	may be added here .

		According to one version , the original story of `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' came from
India	LOCATION	, via
Persia	LOCATION	, or
Egypt	LOCATION	, or
Turkey	LOCATION	, to
China	LOCATION	, and thence to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Anyhow ,
Chikamatsu	LOCATION	, `` the Japanese Shakespeare '' -LRB- 1653-1724 -RRB- , has a play based on a biography of
Shaka	LOCATION	, or
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and in that play he introduces an incident resembling the pound of flesh incident .

		But
Chikamatsu	PERSON	's version of such a complication is much weaker than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ; especially it lacks the interesting legal features .

		It is reported that `` Romeo and Juliet '' was pre - sented in
1810	DATE	at one of the oldest theatres in
Tokyo	LOCATION	; but it is not definitely known from where the Japanese playwright got the original .

		It is , however , conjectured , not unnaturally , that he took the plot from Dutch translations .

		In the Japanese version ,
Romeo	PERSON	becomes `` Tsunagoro , '' and Juliet '' becomes `` Fusa . ''

		In the beginning of the Meiji Era , English lit - erature began to be rather freely translated into Japanese .

		The first of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays thus translated seems to have been ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		Moreover , the first translation of `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' was made , not directly from the orig - inal , but from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's `` Tales . ''

		It is only in com - paratively recent times that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has been ; `` seriously translated , '' by Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	and others .

		It is interesting to note that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays are so popular here that once the proprietor of the theatre known as `` Hongoza '' was able to `` unburden the theatre from heavy debt with the profits derived from the successful presentation of ' Hamlet ' by the late
Otojiro Kawakami	PERSON	, a leading actor of the new school . ''

		I may add that Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	has translated , in all , ten of Shake - speare 's plays .

		`` SHAKSPEBE '' VS. `` SHAKESPEARE '' AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	, in your issue of
May 11	DATE	, attempts to confound the Baconians by his elabo - rate letter intended to show that the various modes of spelling the name of the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor , and of the pseudonym of the author of the plays and poems , were all variants of the patronymic of one man .

		Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much !

		It is of course generally known that spelling in those days was not marked by its modern uniform - ity .

		If it had been , the interesting question now being discussed could not have been raised .

		All available records of the time have been searched by Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	to discover anyone with a similar form of name to the actor 's , and he thinks he shows that the Baconians are wrong .

		But the evidence is too extensive to be useful .

		The enquiry should be confined to the spelling of the actor 's name in records that have no connection with the plays , on the one hand , and to the spelling of the name on the title-pages of the early editions of the plays and poems , on the other hand .

		The reason for this limitation is clear to any unprejudiced per - son , because in places where the two individuals are sought to be identified , as in the preliminary matter attached to the first folio , there we natur - ally find the actor 's name corresponding with the author 's pseudonym .

		The general result of the enquiry so limited goes to show that the spelling of the actor 's name was `` Shakspere '' the a being short as in ``
Jack	PERSON	, '' and the middle s forming part of the first syllable , as is proved by the alternative `` Shaxpere . ''

		And further , that the spelling of the author 's pseudo - nym was `` Shakespeare the first a being long as in `` take , '' and the middle s being part of the second syllable , as is proved by the alternative `` Shake-speare . ''

		This general distinction is clearly illustrated at the present time in the show-cases in the
Boston Public Library	LOCATION	, where may be seen photographic copies of the baptismal and burial entries in the
Stratford	LOCATION	parish registers , as well as the title-pages of several of the early quartos and of the folio editions of the plays .

		It is fair to add that a photographic copy of the mortgage of the Black - friars property has the name spelled both ways , this being one of the partial exceptions to the general rule .

		This deed is very interesting as furnishing evidence that the man of
Stratford	LOCATION	was unable to write , his name being appended by a law clerk in law script , whereas the other parties sign in ordinary italic handwriting .

		In concluding , it may be remarked that by referring to `` the poet '' Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	quietly assumes the point he endeavors vainly to prove .

Mass.	LOCATION	,
June 1 , 1916	DATE	.

		536 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	SHAKESPEARE POTPOURRI .

		The last ten years have almost completely revolutionized our conceptions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, his relations to his associates , the conditions under which he worked , and the stage for which he wrote .

		It is with no little satisfac - tion that we point out that this is almost wholly the result of American scholarship .

		Those who have chiefly contributed to bring this about are , first and foremost , Professor
Wallace	PERSON	and his wife ; then come
G. F. Reynolds	PERSON	,
V. Albright	PERSON	, and
F. S. Graves	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among foreigners we mention only
W. J. Lawrence	PERSON	and
T. Murray	PERSON	; two others are very commonly spoken of as pathfinders in Shakespeare exploration , but as they came not by their materials handsomely we do not name them .

		Owing to these important addi - tions to our knowledge , and to the advent of the tercentenary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death , Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	has brought out a new edition of his `` Life of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' revised , enlarged , and almost wholly rewritten .

		Whereas the first edition of his book , in
1898	DATE	, -LRB- an expansion of his sketch in the `` Dictionary of National Biography '' -RRB- , contained only 461 pages , divided into twenty-one chapters and ten appendices , the present issue contains 713 pages , divided into twenty-seven chapters and ten appendices .

		In addition to this , there is an exceedingly elaborate and valuable Index of forty-four double-columned pages , in all of which we have noted but few errors or omis - sions .

		It is a bit of false modesty or care - lessness on Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's part that the Index contains not a single reference to himself , although in the book itself he refers to almost every scrap of his writings .

		A very commend - able feature of this new `` Life '' is the abundance and scrupulous exactness with which references are given to the writings of others , especially Americans whom the author had slighted in former editions .

		The book is a good specimen of the printer 's art ; and the proof-reader , too , has done his work remark - ably well .

		That a volume of this size should contain less than a dozen misprints is a phenomenon deserving special mention .

		We are also pleased to note that Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has reformed , even if only indifferently , his habit of saying `` doubtless '' when speaking of mat - ters wholly conjectural , an indication , we hope , that some day he may learn to realize the usefulness of such words as `` possibly , '' * A LIFE OF
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE	PERSON	.

		By Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		New edition , rewritten and enlarged .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` probably , '' and `` perhaps '' -LRB- important words when dealing with Shakespeare -RRB- , to say `` seems '' for `` would seem , '' and to place the word `` only '' where it belongs .

		This book calls for a very critical examina - tion because of the author 's reputation for scholarship , the tone of finality with which he speaks , the authority with which he `` imposes '' -LRB- as the Germans say -RRB- on those who have not investigated the facts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life for themselves , and the incalculable mischief that errors in such a book may work .

		The truth is that we do not yet know enough about Shakespeare positively ; that we still have to piece out with guesswork and conjecture the few scattered fragments that have escaped time 's devastating influences ; and that we have to resort to a deal of padding to make a plausible `` Life '' which is to sell for two dollars .

		To reconstruct Shakespeare for us , his biographer must be not only a competent compiler of other men 's work and a scholar , but must be richly endowed with the bio - graphic imagination and a fine psychologic insight .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's book gives abundant evidence of the first two qualities , but not a trace of the second .

		In his work the general reader and teacher will find nearly all the known facts , traditions , and guesses pertain - ing to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's parentage , education , marriage , training , work , financial transac - tions , property , sources , theatrical conditions , retirement , death , will , descendants , signa - tures , portraits , etc. .

		There are excellent chapters on the Baconian heresy , the growth of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fame at home and abroad , the Quartos and Folios , his editors , etc. .

		We miss , however , an account of the Shakespeare apocrypha , the numerous anti-Willian obses - sions , an account of the
Northumberland	LOCATION	and
Promus	ORGANIZATION	manuscripts , a transcript of the poet 's will and other important documents .

		Almost a fourth of the book is devoted to the discus - sion of the Sonnets the only department of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	study to which Sir
Sidney	PERSON	may be said to have contributed anything original ; but we must not withhold from him the credit of having discovered that the sculptor of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tomb was
Garret Janssen	PERSON	, the son , not
Gheeraert Janssen	PERSON	, the father ; that
John Combe	PERSON	was not the owner of `` The
College House	ORGANIZATION	'' ; and that this same
John	PERSON	-LRB- `` Shakespeare 's especial friend '' -RRB- was `` a confirmed bachelor , '' unless we also accord him the distinction of having discovered that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must have known that the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Indians kept the fish-dams of the Virgin - ians in good order .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	devotes too much space to the marshalling of hordes of facts , facts , facts ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 537 which are not only uninteresting in them - i selves but which contribute absolutely noth - !

		ing to our understanding or appreciation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		According to this method , there j is absolutely no limit to the size a Shakespeare biography may reach .

		In subsequent edi - j tions we may be regaled with chapters on the j lives of each witness to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's will , | his attorneys , his theatrical associates , his neighbors , etc. , etc. .

		The author 's guiding ; principle seems to have been to include every -LSB- fact that can in any way be brought into association with the poet .

		The result is a maze of shreds and patches without any sense ; of unity .

		It would be much nearer the truth : to call this volume a dictionary or manual of .

		Shakespeareana than `` A Life of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	. ''

		Shakespeare scholarship is not advanced a ; jot by any such false , misleading , or ill - ' founded assertions as that
William	PERSON	left
Strat	PERSON	- ford `` in the later months of
1585	DATE	, '' especially when we are subsequently told with as little reason also that his departure was `` doubtless -LSB- ! -RSB-

		in the early

John left Snitterfield	PERSON	`` about 1552 '' ; i that the bulk of

Snitterfield	LOCATION	; that he was a keen man of business and that he married
Mary Arden	PERSON	because she had a handsome dowry -LRB- accord - ing to Sir
Sidney	PERSON	the Shakespeares all lived for money -RRB- ; that he had a `` ready command ' of figures '' and that this `` relieves him of the imputation of illiteracy '' ; that

Richard	LOCATION	: Field ; that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	`` doubtless knew !

		Florio first as

		that only two c-f

Heminge	PERSON	and

Albright	PERSON	calls this -RRB- ; that at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death `` no mark of honor was denied his name '' -LRB- an assertion that has no foundation in recorded fact -RRB- ; that the poet `` uncomplainingly submitted to the wholesale piracy of his plays and the ascription to him of books by other hands '' -LRB- this is flatly contradicted by
Heywood ; cf. Lee	PERSON	, p. 269 -RRB- ; that the
1599	DATE	negotiations with the College were crowned with success -LRB- an assertion wholly at variance with all known facts or logical inference -RRB- ; that the heralds proposed to assign to the Shakespeares the arms of a family living at Alvanley to which they were not related ; that the red - nosed Bardolph in `` Henry V '' is a satire on `` Sir
William Phillipp	PERSON	/ Lord Bardolph '' -LRB- there were Bardolphs enow in
Stratford	LOCATION	if the dramatist needed a living model -RRB- ; that the `` treble sceptres '' in `` Macbeth '' relate to the ` union of
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	-LRB- the allusion is unquestionably to
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	-RRB- ; that
Prospero	PERSON	's enchanted island was one of the Bermudas -LRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself tells us it was not -RRB- ; that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name occurs sixty-six times in the
Stratford Council	LOCATION	books ; that
Camden	LOCATION	was mainly responsible for the grant of arms to Shakespeare -LRB- it was certainly Dethick -RRB- ; and so forth .

		It would be impos - sible to enumerate here all of Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's unwarranted assertions of fact and ill-con - sidered inferences , and to disprove them would require several volumes the size of his .

		But we can not let the opportunity go by to correct some of the most grievous errors cur - rent about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for some of which
Sir Sidney	ORGANIZATION	is responsible .

		Discussing Shakespeare 's handwriting and autographs , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	makes several state - ments that are not in accord with the known facts .

		We are told -LRB- p. 519 -RRB- that the poet , as a result of his provincial education , never troubled to learn the fashionable Italian script but adhered throughout his life exclusively to the old English or Gothic script .

		But , as 538 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	a matter of fact ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's six signatures , the only admitted evidence on the subject , are written in a mixed Italian and Gothic a characteristic of the handwriting of some of the best educated men of his day , for example :
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Drake	LOCATION	,
Cecil	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	, etc. .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	boldly asserts -LRB- p. 520 -RRB- that `` it is certain -LSB- ! -RSB-

		that -LSB-
William	PERSON	-RSB- wrote -LSB- his surname -RSB- indifferently Shakspere ,
Shakespere	LOCATION	,
Shakespear	PERSON	or Shakspeare . ''

		My knowledge of Elizabethan script , based on fifteen years ' study of the subject , enables me to say that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's extant autographs are either written `` Shaksper ' '' -LRB- mortgage and deed -RRB- , '' Shakspere '' -LRB- testament and
Florio	PERSON	's `` Mon - taigne '' -RRB- , and `` Shaksp ` r ' '' -LRB- deposition -RRB- .

		The abbreviated signature on the title-page of
Ovid	LOCATION	's `` Metamorphoses , '' the property of the Bodleian Library , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	reads `` Sh e , '' although it is unquestionably `` Sh r '' ; and he is inclined to regard it as a genuine autograph on the authority of
Leo	PERSON	and
Macray	PERSON	although a careful scientific examination would surely have convinced him that it is an impudent forgery .

		The Montaigne signature is rejected as spurious , although it has a much better claim to be regarded genuine than the
Ovid	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's facsimile of the mortgage signature is spoiled by the heavy shadow across the upper part of the parchment strip , and the
Wallace	PERSON	signature is defective in lacking the insignificant little blot under the S which sceptics pretend to consider as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` mark . ''

		Impartial students ought to be permitted to judge for themselves as to this .

		Baconians are sure to discover a motive in the omission of the blot .

		Graphi - ologists will be amused to read -LRB- p. 647 -RRB- that in the opinion of Sir
Sidney	PERSON	the rascally young
Ireland	LOCATION	`` had acquired much skill in copying
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genuine signature . ''

		Anything more clumsy than
Ireland	LOCATION	's fabri - cations can not be imagined .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has probably never laid eyes on any of these for - geries .

		That our author is in the habit of quoting from documents that he has not con - sulted is certain .

		Thus , speaking of the sec - ond
1596	DATE	heraldic draft , he says that it differs from the first in only two alterations -LRB- although it differs from it in many respects , especially in the important matter of the description of the coat-of-arms -RRB- , and that the last one of the memoranda at the bottom of this document reads : `` That he mar -LSB- ried a daughter and heyre of
Arden	LOCATION	, a gent , of wor - ship -RSB- . ''

		An examination of the draft a transcript of which ought to be given shows that the clerk never got beyond `` That he mar '' and that the bracketed words which Sir
Sidney	PERSON	says are an interlineation existed only in the imagination of the writer from whom Sir
Sidney	PERSON	copied .

		While we are on this subject of handwriting we may refer to Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's repeated assertions that Mr.
Ernest Law	PERSON	has `` completely vindicated '' the genuineness of certain suspected entries in the Master of the Bevels 's Account Books for 1604-5 and 1611-12 .

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	has , as a matter of fact , done no more than to re-open the subject and to show the necessity for a genu - inely scientific investigation of these play - lists by an allowed handwriting expert .

		We strongly suspect that
George Steevens	PERSON	had something to do with them .

		The characters of
John	PERSON	and
William Shakespeare	PERSON	suffer past thinking on at the hands of Sir
Sidney	PERSON	.

		No matter how shadowy an item he may be discussing , he always man - ages to give it an ugly interpretation .

		No wonder the Baconians and the pious New Englanders whose achievements always harmonize with their morals and characters !

		can not marry the man to his verse .

		Lee finds that in
1601	DATE	Mrs.
Anne Shakespeare	PERSON	was indebted to
Thomas Whittington	PERSON	, her father 's ex-shepherd , in the sum of forty shillings , and he at once jumps to the con - clusion that up to 1595 -LRB- why 1595 ? -RRB-


William	PERSON	did not provide for his family , -LRB- hoarded all his income for the purchase of a coat-of-arms -RRB- , so that his wife had to `` borrow '' money of a shepherd that she and her children might live ; and what makes matters worse is that up to 1601 the parsimonious and money-grubbing hack had not paid his wife 's debt .

		A little legal training or a course in logic would do Sir
Sidney	PERSON	yeoman service .

		Is it not possible that Mistress
Anne	PERSON	gave her father 's shep - herd employment on her husband 's estate , and that the forty shillings -LRB- the equivalent of about
$ 35.00	MONEY	today -RRB- were unpaid wages ?

		Or , as Mr.
Fraser	PERSON	suggests , that
Thomas	PERSON	had put this money `` in the hand of
Anne Shaxspere	PERSON	wyffe unto Mr.
Wyllyam Shaxspere	PERSON	'' for safe - keeping ?

		`` Deliver all with charity , '' says
Katherine	PERSON	; and a biographer of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	might be expected to heed her .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	errs -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- in his statement that
Whitting	PERSON	- ton 's will is dated `` 1602 . ''

		According to Sir
Sidney	PERSON	,
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	's friends forced
William	PERSON	to marry her , without the knowledge and consent of his parents , because they feared he might seek to evade the obligation incumbent upon him in conse - quence of his illicit relations with her .

		But there is absolutely nothing in the known facts to exclude the theory that
William	PERSON	loved
Anne	PERSON	; that , for social reasons and perhaps because of the disparity in their ages , his parents objected to the match ; that the lovers
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 539 had been formally betrothed several months before the marriage ; and that they solicited the aid of the bride 's friends to unite them in wedlock .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	meets this theory with the wholly invalid objections that a formal betrothal of this sort required the consent of the parents of both parties , and that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's references to betrothal deny the betrothed the right of cohabitation .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	errs in both these points .

		As to the former , he is flatly contradicted , on unques - tionable evidence , by Halliwell-Phillipps , and as to the second by no less an authority than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself -LRB- `` Measure for Meas - ure , '' V. I , 425 ; `` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' I. 2 , 278 ; and especially `` Cymbeline , '' II .

		5 , 9 -RRB- .

		Posthumus and
Imogen	PERSON	were troth-plight without the knowledge and consent of
Imogen	PERSON	's parents , and he complains that she `` restrained '' him of his `` lawful pleasure . ''

		To what desperate lengths Sir
Sidney	PERSON	will go to make a point is evidenced -LRB- p. 30n -RRB- by the forced and coarse interpretation of
Rosalind	PERSON	's words in `` As You Like It , '' III .

		2 , 233 .

		In some respects our author is childishly amusing , as , for instance , in his determina - tion not to acknowledge that Professor AVallace has unquestionably determined the true site of the Globe Theatre and that he -LRB- Lee -RRB- and Sir Herbert Tree had wilfully placed a commemorative tablet on the wrong site .

		Rather than acknowledge that Professor
Wallace	PERSON	has determined that money toward the
end of the sixteenth century	DATE	was worth three and a half times what it is worth to-day , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	gives the valuation as five an evident compromise between the valuation , eight , given by him in former editions of his book and Professor
Wallace	PERSON	's present valu - ation .

		At page 301 we are amused to read that `` a proof that -LSB-
William	PERSON	's -RSB- reputation excelled that of any of his partners '' is the fact that in an inventory of an estate of which
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	formed a part the property was described as in the occupation of ``
William Shakespeare	PERSON	and others . ''

		With this kind of logic one might prove that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was held in contempt at court in
1604	DATE	because in a warrant for payment to the Grooms of the Chamber he is not mentioned by name , whereas
Heminge	PERSON	and
Phillipps	PERSON	are .

		To prove that
William	PERSON	did not take an active part in `` the war of the theatres '' he inter - prets the words `` Shakespeare hath given -LSB-
Jonson	PERSON	-RSB- a purge that made him bewray his credit '' as meaning no more than that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	`` had signally outstripped
Jonson	PERSON	in popular esteem . ''

		Of merely aesthetic criticism there is fortu - nately very little in this book .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's interpretation of the Sonnets as the artificial exercises of a very adaptable poet 's leisure moments is too well-known to be set forth at length and in this place .

		To us there is abso - lutely nothing to commend it .

		Unfortunately , the positive data about these poems are so few that there is nothing to hinder anyone so inclined from indulging in the most fantastic speculations concerning them .

		Of all the methods of approaching these difficult prob - lems , that chosen by Sir
Sidney	PERSON	the method of comparative study is the simplest , most superficial , and most barren in results .

		The themes of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets are differ - ent from those of any of his contemporaries except Barnfield .

		The intensity of the emo - tions exhibited in these poems and the fact that they were not intended for publication prove that they were the sincere outpourings of a man consumed by an overwhelming pas - sion .

		That passion was a forbidden attach - ment to a young , handsome , accomplished young man the typical effeminate homo - psychic `` love-object . ''

		That
Shakespeare	PERSON	was homosexual admits of no doubt to one free from the current moral prejudices and acquainted with the facts of modern sexology .

		That the poet 's passion was ideal only is cer - tain from Sonnet 20:13 -14 .

		Any critic who finds , as Sir
Sidney	PERSON	does , in the `` Willobie his Avisa '' a reflection of the story in the Sonnets is too deep-rooted in his preconceptions to be able to shed any light on the great Shakespeare mystery .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's moment - ous conclusion that the Sonnet-story comes nearer the confines of comedy than of tragedy -LRB- p. 221 -RRB- is worthy of a critic who finds
Barnes	PERSON	's sixty-sixth Sonnet `` a first-rate poem , ''
Lear	PERSON	's poor Fool a `` half-witted lad , '' and in Lady Macbeth an absence of a moral sense .

		In a former edition of his book , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	gravely announced that he had independently investigated the matter of the Shakespeare application for a coat-of-arms and had reached very important conclusions .

		And so he had ; but with what dire results to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's character may be gathered from the fact that every Baconian quotes him with gleeful avidity , and even
Churton Collins	PERSON	speaks of
William	LOCATION	's `` bogus coat-of-arms . ''

		How hastily and ill-advisedly Sir
Sidney	PERSON	reached his conclusions , and with what little regard for the characters of the men involved -LRB-
John	PERSON	and
William Shakespeare	PERSON	,
William Camden	PERSON	,
William Dethick	PERSON	, and the
Earl of Essex	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will be evident upon a reconsidera - tion of the evidence .

		Puzzled by the fact that in
1599	DATE	the College of Arms drafted a docu - ment purporting to assign to the Shakespeares 540 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	the right to impale and to quarter with the arms of Shakespeare -LRB- incorrectly depicted on the cover of Sir
Sidney	PERSON	's book -RRB- with those of
Arden	LOCATION	, the writer concludes that
John	PERSON	's appli - cation for arms in
1596	DATE	had failed , and he thence spins out a contemptible conspiracy between the Shakespeares , especially
William	PERSON	, and the officers of the College to make the for - mer butcher 's assistant , stable-boy , and poacher a `` gentleman . ''

		All this falls to the ground if we can show , as we have no doubt we can , that the
1596	DATE	application was granted , and rightly granted , and that there was there - fore no occasion for a conspiracy .

		After
1597	DATE	the poet and his father are almost invari - ably accorded the honorable addition of `` Master '' or `` gentleman '' unequivocal evi - dence that they had been admitted to the rank of gentry before that year .

		Mr.
Charles H. Athill	PERSON	,
Richmond Herald	ORGANIZATION	, assured me in
1908	DATE	that `` the fact that the -LSB-
1596	DATE	-RSB- arms appear again in the assignment for
Arden	ORGANIZATION	in
1599	DATE	clearly proves that the
1596	DATE	patent did pass , otherwise they would not have been included in that patent . ''


John Guillim	PERSON	, in his monu - mental `` Display of Heraldry , '' without reli - ance upon any Shakespeare biographer , credits the granting of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	arms to
William Dethick	PERSON	,
Garter King-at-arms	PERSON	.

		Had the grant been made in
1599	DATE	the name of Sir
William Camden	PERSON	, who had in the interim been made Clarencieux King-at-arms , would have been added to that of Dethick .

		In the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	is a manuscript known as ``
Harl	PERSON	.

		MS. 6140 '' -LRB- fol .

		45 -RRB- , in which the Shakespeare `` pattent '' is sketched and ascribed to ``
William Dethike	PERSON	. ''

		In the `` Index College of Arms , '' a record which is preserved in the
College	ORGANIZATION	,
John Warburton	PERSON	,
Somerset Herald	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1720-1759 -RRB- , describes the Shakespeare coat and says it was `` granted 20
October , 1596	DATE	, per Will Dethick . ''

		The fail - ure of any member of the Shakespeare fam - ily anywhere to display the
Arden	PERSON	arms proves that the
1599	DATE	application did not terminate in a grant .

		This fact , taken in connection with the other facts just mentioned , and also with the further fact that the Shakespeares , the Halls , and the Nashes freely displayed the Shakespeare arms , proves with the utmost cer - tainty that the
1596	DATE	application was approved by the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The unlawful assumption of a coat-of-arms was strictly prohibited .

		In the reign of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	the Kings-of-Arms had been empowered `` to reprove , control and make infamous by proclamation all such as unlawfully and without just authority , usurped or took any name or title of honor or dignity , as esquire , gentleman , or other . ''

		It is of course true that a negative pregnant such as is implied in our last argument proves nothing ; but it is equally true that justice requires us to regard all even poets as law-abiding subjects until the contrary is proved against them .

		Why the
1599	DATE	appli - cation was made , why the heralds struck out one sketch and substituted another , why the
1596	DATE	application was made , and why the Shakespeares were entitled to arms , I have already discussed in these columns .


William Shakespeare	PERSON	, as portrayed by Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, is not only very mercenary and litigious but is a very revengeful judgment - creditor , insisting on having his pound of flesh even when his debtor is his childhood 's playfellow or the town 's apothecary .

		That the poet personally had nothing to do with these petty suits , and that they we * e probably prosecuted without his knowledge or consent , may be reasonably inferred from the fact that he did not figure as plaintiff in a single suit for debt after he retired from
London	LOCATION	and took personal charge of his estate .

		If Sir
Sidney	PERSON	thinks it logical and correct to refer to two lines in `` Troilus and Cressida '' a play which he elsewhere tells us
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not write as evidence that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	knew something about poaching and that this lends color to the poaching tradi - tion , we may , more warrantably , be permitted , notwithstanding Pope 's cleverly-worded coup - let , to refer to
Hamlet	LOCATION	's contempt for those sheep and calves who seek out assurance in parchment as proof that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	knew a higher goal than the pursuit of wealth .

		And similarly , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	could readily enough have found abundant material in the plays to show that the poet was above the petty snob - bishness that craved for a purchased coat-of - arms as a means of social distinction ; this the more so as there is nowhere the slightest hint that
William	PERSON	had anything to do with the applications to the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The refer - ence to the poaching story leads us to point out that Sir
Sidney	PERSON	characterizes almost all the traditions handed down by late seven - teenth century and early eighteenth century gossips as `` credible '' or `` well attested , '' though they have nothing to commend them , but rejects as `` idle gossip '' the Rev.
Richard Davies	PERSON	's report that the poet `` dyed a papist '' the only one of the traditions that is corrob - orated by collateral testimony .

		The current belief that for years the Shakespeares suf - fered from poverty Sir
Sidney	PERSON	accepts with - out question , notwithstanding the existence of a large body of positive evidence to the con - trary .

		Shakespeare was a great genius but , judged by our standards , not a great man .

		He was
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 541 a man like other men , a tangled skein of good and ill together .

		We shall never know much about him as he lived in the flesh ; but Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's picture of him as a lawless , prof - ligate , snobbish , sycophantic , and mercenary opportunist accords but ill with the `` gentle , '' `` sweet , '' `` friendly '' Shakespeare whom
Ben Jonson	PERSON	described as `` of a free and open nature , '' and whose honesty , civil demeanor , and `` uprightness of dealing ''
Chettle	PERSON	extolled .


SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		SENTIMENTAL , ARISTOCRA.CT .

		* An astronomer at his vigils , viewing light travelling with incredible speed over incred - ible distances , may be observing to-day move - ments of his favorite constellation which occurred during the American Revolution .

		A similar but too often a far less impressive experience is not seldom the lot of the critic .

		It is indeed with an emotion quite as exalting as an astronomer 's that the critic finds in a modern opinion the confirmation of some - thing which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	wrote more than two thou - sand years ago , some current of thought which perhaps has flowed on like a deep stream under the earth until it gushes forth to refresh a faint traveller far distant who drinks , perchance , without knowing its source .

		But the critic has experiences more often grotesque than idyllic .

		Again and again he finds to his distress that a stream of thought which he had fondly believed to have found a just oblivion in some desert has survived to feed with its brackish streams some scrawny oasis .

		The reader of Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's `` A Defence of Aristocracy '' will find a thought-current that flowed with turbid force in the middle of the nineteenth century .

		I had supposed it dead , at least among ambitious essayists , to-day .

		I could even have hoped that it had been killed by a passage in that queer but stimulating farrago .

		`` The Communist Mani - festo '' by
Marx	ORGANIZATION	and
Engels	PERSON	, which appeared in
1848	DATE	, when essays and speeches like Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's began to emerge in considerable numbers .

		Marx and
Engels	PERSON	wrote : In order to arouse sympathy the aristocrats -LSB- whose cause had been dealt a death-blow in the French Bevolution -RSB- were obliged to lose sight appar - ently of their own interests , and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working classes alone .

		Thus the aris - tocrats took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new master , and whispering in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe .

		* A DEFENCE OF ARISTOCBACY .


Boston	LOCATION	: Le
Roy Phillips	PERSON	.

		By
Anthony M. Ludovici	PERSON	.

		In this way arose feudal socialism : half lamenta - tion , half lampoon ; half echo of the past , half menace of the future ; at times by its bitter , witty , and inci - sive criticism , striking the bourgeoisie -LSB- Le .

		the mer - chant capitalists large and small -RSB- to the very heart 's core , but always ludicrous in its effect , through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history .

		The aristocracy , in order to rally the people to them , waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner .

		But the people , so often as it joined them , saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats-of - anns , all deserted with loud irreverent laughter .

		Something of Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's crocodile lamen - tation over the sorrows of the modern serf , coupled with a sentimental longing for the return of the robber-baron -LRB- so much more picturesque than the robber-merchant -RRB- , viti - ates much of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's `` Past and Present , '' that brilliant , sombre , richly-suggestive con - temporary of the dithyramb by
Marx	ORGANIZATION	and
Engels	LOCATION	.

		But Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	-LRB- who refers occa - sionally to
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	in the language of the proverbial fish-wife -RRB- has none of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's great virtues , though he has all of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's vices with not a few of his own , and a few private virtues which are at best but a sorry substitute for the earlier mode of neo-aris - tocratic hero-worship .

		In the first chapter , on `` The Aristocrat as the Essential Ruler , '' Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	thus defines the principle of aristocracy : The principle of aristocracy is , that seeing that human life , like any other kind of life , produces some nourishing and some less flourishing , some fortunate and some less fortunate specimens ; in order that flourishing , full and fortunate life may be prolonged , multiplied and , if possible , enhanced on earth , the wants of flourishing life , its optimum of conditions , must be made known and authorita - tively imposed upon men by its representatives .

		Observe some of the presuppositions of this definition , if you can be sure of any pre - suppositions in a definition so vague .

		The eternal truth of all things , it would seem , has been discovered by some persons who were thrown at a lucky angle from
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	's indefatigable dice-box .

		Man , it seems , has discovered so much about Dame Nature that he knows that
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	knows more than he does -LRB- whoever or whatever Dame Nature may be -RRB- ; and so , with a finely heroic fatalism , he is willing to leave it to
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	's `` flourishing '' productions -LRB- whatever `` flour - ishing '' may mean -RRB- to cram the law and the prophets down the maws of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's numer - ous little human jokes very much as medi - cine was once administered to horses by enthusiastic but somewhat primitive veter inaries .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	throws away immedi - ately one of his most plausible arguments for a new aristocracy by denouncing '' the fanatics and followers of Science '' with all the tradi - tional fear of aristocrats in times past .

		His 542 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	sneer at science recurs again and again throughout the book , though on a few occa - sions he condescends to quote anthropological and biological dicta which seem to bear out his case .

		Had Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	overcome that age-long aristocratic dread of all innovation which once dealt so crudely with
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	he would have found a powerful ally in some students of genetics .

		But the aristocracy in which genetics is interested would be too rational for his taste .

		A relish of his polemics will make clear to the reader just how much Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	cares for the somewhat unpop - ular processes of calm reason .

		This is not a `` matter of opinion , '' it is not a matter concerning which every futile flaneur in Fleet Street can have his futile opinion .

		It is the
Divine Truth	ORGANIZATION	of life .

		And the democrat who dares to deny it is not only a blind imbecile , he is not only a cor - rupt and sickly specimen of manhood , he is a rank blasphemer , whose hands are stained with the blood of his people 's future .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	quotes
Bolingbroke	PERSON	's fine say - ing that `` A divine right to govern ill is an absurdity : to assert it is blasphemy . ''

		He protests justly against Puritanical and bour - geois dualisms of body and spirit which lead to asceticism , morbidity , or hypocrisy .

		He blames modern aristocracy severely for its forgetfulness of noblesse oblige .

		But the true aristocrat he defines with all the characteris - tic vagueness , fatalism , and sentimentality of such reactionary paternalism .

		The true ruler must have `` taste and good judgment , arising from the promptings of fortunate and flour - ishing life in the superior man , '' `` one who has that spontaneous and unerring taste ivhich is the possession of nature 's ` lucky strokes ' '' ; he is to rejoice in the onerous but `` noble duty of caring for the hearts of the masses . ''

		-LRB- The italics are mine . -RRB-

		`` When men exist , '' con - tinues our rhapsodist , `` whose characters and achievements shed a glamour upon everything that surrounds them , no duty they can impose upon their immediate entourage , no effort they can demand of it , whether it be the bear - ing of children or the building of a pyramid , can be felt as a humiliation or as an act of oppression . ''

		In the second and third chapters , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	denounces the English aristocrat of later days as a failure .

		No democrat could be more fearless and abusive .

		He bids him `` drink copiously at the fount of
Bolingbroke	LOCATION	,
Pitt	PERSON	and Beaconsfield . ''

		He finds much scrip - ture in
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	, and
Nietzsche	PERSON	-LRB- all of whom are indeed suggestive thinkers when not in the hands of one who would brew of them all a strange and sentimental witches ' broth -RRB- .

		He deals implacably and justly with the confusion of aristocracy and irresponsible plutocracy .

		He attacks the lust of modern capitalism , but idealizes the old Tudor and
Stuart	PERSON	fear of capitalism into a prophetic vision of its nineteenth and twentieth century evils .

		The best instincts of the Tudors and the Stuarts were against this transformation of
England	LOCATION	from a garden into a slum , from `` Merrie England '' into a home of canting , snivelling , egotistical , greedy and unscrupulous plutocrats , standing upon a human foundation of half - besotted slaves .

		Doubtless there is an element of truth in this .

		But the reviewer must also subscribe enough to the doctrines of those `` fanatics and fol - lowers of Science '' whom Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	hates on principle and cites for convenience to inter - pret that fear as also the desire for self - preservation in a more sordid sense and as too often a fear with staring eyes glued strictly on the present .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	says defiantly : I submit that it was on the battlefields of
Edgehill	LOCATION	,
Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	and Naseby that trade first advanced in open hostility against tradition , quantity against quality , capitalistic industry against agriculture and the old industry of the Guilds , vulgarity against taste , machinery against craftmanship , grey and mournful Puritanism against cheerful and ruddy Paganism in fact , plebian democracy against aris - tocracy .

		One need not pause here over the familiar exaggeration and cant about Puritanism and art to remind the reader of Colonel
Hutchin	PERSON	- son , of
Marvel	ORGANIZATION	, of
Milton	LOCATION	.

		There is some truth in what Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	says , and it should never be forgotten , especially in twentieth century
America	LOCATION	.

		But we must remember also that this `` ruddy Paganism '' of the Stuarts , which they affected in imitation of the more truly vigorous Tudors , too often took the form of a blind and deceitful conserva - tism and a feline hedonism that made radical - ism all the cruder when it forced its way upward with violence ; that blind feudal con - servatism -LRB- not the tempering enlightened conservatism -RRB- shares the responsibility for the horrors of the age of machinery with bour - geois Puritanism .

		And later on , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	somewhat contradicts himself by admitting the wolfish depredations on the peasants by
Henry VIII	PERSON	and his `` ruffianly favourites , '' and by tracing from the time of
Edward VI	PERSON	`` the capitalistic and greedy element in the landed gentry and aristocracy . ''

		He speaks of the yeoman prowess of labor on the fields of Crecy and Poictiers , and -LRB- writing just before the outbreak of to-day 's great war -RRB- he warns the English aristocracy that their abuse of the pleb will vitiate English soldiery , a warning that sounds strangely prophetic to us who read daily of the just obstinacy of labor in
England	LOCATION	in these critical days .

		He reminds us sensibly that `` again and again
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 543 mere change has falsely been welcomed as Progress . ''

		He quotes the wise words of
Adam Smith	PERSON	, who warned men that `` the earlier economists , like ourselves , were hypnotised by the spectacle of the extreme poverty prevail - ing in the lower ranks of labour , and , as a : .

		result , they were induced to pursue comfort and hygiene as if they were ends in them - selves , and as if the whole industrial problem were to be discovered in their attainment . '' -RCB-

		Ir .

		Ludovici shows a fine but somewhat near - sighted scorn of trade `` where sheer speed is !

		often a means to success , '' combined with that sentimental conception of leisure which would remedy the evils of quick-lunches and railway accidents by the restoration of picturesque stage-coaches .

		He blames
Darwin	PERSON	and his fol - lowers rather unfairly for that unscientific confusion of biological and moral law which has been such a devil 's advocate among mod - ern business men .

		He makes an excellent attack on `` charity and benevolence '' -LRB- as usually interpreted to-day -RRB- as `` not the coun - ter-agents chosen by rulers and deep think - ers '' but `` essentially the counter-agents which occur to the shallowest and least thoughtful j minds . ''

		But his vague aristocratic panacea is not very reassuring : It requires ruler qualities of the highest order , I knowledge covering the widest range , and thought of the deepest kind , correlated with all the leisure that would render these possessions fruitful and operative .

		He blames the English aristocracy for becom - ing hedonists , but he does not realize that the English bourgeoisie , partly because the old aristocrats were already hedonists , reduced j their power and now keep them as decora - tions .

		In other words , he does not realize that because the earlier aristocrats chose to be hedonists , they are now forced to be hedon - j ists by a plutocratic middle class which in turn practises a gross hedonism itself .

		In ; short , though Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	is very effective in his denunciation of both contemporary aris - tocracy and bourgeoisie , he is utterly blind to the great contributions of the middle classes to civilization , and with the typical
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	- ism of his sect he would create Utopia by restoring the idealized feudal aristocrat whom he is forced to define in vague and sentimental terms simply because such a creature as he | describes never existed and never will exist , a dim shadow of that paragon whom Aristotle described much better in terms more suave and beautiful , more clear but still too vague , !

		the magnanimous man , the versatile , the benevolent , the detached , the heroic self with an Olympian ennui .

		From Chapter V , `` The Metamorphosis of the Englishman of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' ; one might well gather that to Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	`` the unscrupulous spirit of gain and greed '' now attained to power for the first time in centuries .

		He traces the deterioration of physical beauty .

		It is certainly true that many seventeenth century Puritans and many twentieth century heads of corporations are not objects lovely to the contemplation of the portrait painter ; but it does not follow , as Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	asserts , that faces and bodies which a minority of fastidious people declare to be beautiful are the sure concomitants of noble character .

		However much the reader may believe in a Platonic union of the idea of beauty and the idea of goodness -LRB- a doc - trine to which the present reviewer subscribes emphatically -RRB- , it is not always easy to accept one whom many of aristocratic taste have called beautiful as empirical evidence of the union of these two ideals even partially real - ized .

		But Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	is at least consistent ; he classes
Socrates	PERSON	among `` the men who have created or established things that all good taste must deplore things of which the whole world will one day regret to have heard , '' one of the `` ugliest beasts that ever blighted a sunny day . ''

		It is somewhat diffi - cult to follow him , even after accepting his postulates , when he places
Napoleon	PERSON	among those who were at once good and beautiful .

		But perhaps that is because I have never seen a decent portrait of Napoleon or because my taste is hopelessly bourgeois .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	writes with just indignation against the influ - ence of the Industrial Revolution on the physical well-being of the children of labor .

		But he seems to describe the Puritan tactics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a nation-wide conspiracy not only to create a crudely dualistic conception of soul and body but also to so depress the phys - ical well-being of those who worked in modern industries as to starve out the sexual desire .

		It all reads like the alarmist interpretation of the deep-scheming , well-unified capitalists that we hear from street corner orators in twentieth-century
America	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps this conspiracy is a matter of indisputable history , but I have not yet been made aware that psy - chology and sociology have confirmed the notion that modern industry succeeds in mak - ing the sexual desires less active .

		In the sixth chapter , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	deals with `` The Decline of Manners and Morals under the Modern Democracy of Uncontrolled Trade and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		After a rather good criticism of the sordidly abstract point of view which he and some other people call Socialism , he sets forth his own fundamental criterion , Taste : 544 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	Very well , then , Taste , which is the power of dis - cerning right from wrong in matters of doctrine , diet , behavior , shape , form , constitution , size , height , colour , sound and general appearance , is the greatest power of life ; it is a power leading to permanence of life in those who possess it and who can exercise it .

		The absence of taste , or bad taste as it is some - times called in these same matters , is a defect involv - ing death , it is a defect leading to sickness or tran - siency in life in those who suffer from it .

		To a less vague definition of taste we never attain in this book .

		Against the philosophy of unbridled economic determinism -LRB- if we may be allowed to call a quack-science a phil - osophy by accepting the connotations of the man in the street -RRB- , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	opposes the even cruder and more tarnished philosophy of a world of moral and aesthetic conflict between the snow-white purity of a minority party thrown into the world by some `` lucky strokes of nature '' and a majority party of fast-black sordidness , all of which is an alle - gory which would do credit to his arch-foes , the Puritans , even in their most naive moments of measuring the universe with a yardstick .

		How in these days when , as Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	admits , the twisted and warped have undue power , are we to select as rulers these `` lucky strokes of nature , '' or how are they going to select themselves and awe the mob ?

		One feels the need of science , or of some mode of thought more sinewy than Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's sentimental verbosity .

		We shall later find Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	forced to retreat to the trenches of what he calls science .

		Meanwhile he grows more and more loosely intuitional .

		How are the people to appreciate these aristocrats who have this vague superiority which Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	calls taste ?

		The people `` do not need to understand or to judge the examples of flourishing life . ''

		Suffice it that they say gushingly : `` We want them because we feel that they understand us . ''

		Like most aris - tocrats , then , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	would keep the masses in submissive ignorance , although later on he prescribes a limited and severely winnowing process of education conducted by aristocrats who will occasionally single out a rare spirit whose ideals can be stamped with aristocratic notions .

		To be sure , we are told , the masses may rebel should aristocracy become unworthy .

		Well , the saddest thing about rebellions in the past has always been that fine principles have been muddled , by the ignorant uprisers , with superstition and hysteria .

		Imagine the horrors which would arise with a rebellion in Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's Utopia .

		Truly the golden age of feudalism would return with its reverse side ; rebel - lions conducted in the manner of the brutish
Jacquerrie	PERSON	, the convulsive hydrophobia of men whose wrongs and disillusionments have not been such as to inspire enlightened revolt or to strengthen them against equally bru - tish reprisals .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	goes on , how - ever , with an admirable analysis of bourgeois democracy : the tawdriness of its leisure-class , the laissez-faire of its economics , the low attitude of men towards women and of women towards themselves , the ugly clothes , the sala - cious theatricals on and off the stage , the rushing automobiles with their peremptory honkings , the vulgar display of wealth with - out any knowledge of its true worth , the decline in physical comeliness , the mania 011 the part of many of our most vulgar to collect old masterpieces merely as symbols of the owners ' power .

		Then he turns to review the causes of the gradual passing of the gentle - man .

		We are presented with another char - acteristically vague and rosy definition : A gentleman in body and soul is a creature whose very tissues are habituated to act in an honourable way .

		For many generations , then , his people must have acted in an honourable way .

		We note again the typical defect of most neo - aristocrats : these gentlemen of Utopia are moved only by the dynamic force of fatalistic traditionalism .

		Another definition , as lumi - nous as a heavy fog , confirms the aristocratic fatalism : `` Conscience , .

		.

		to the non - Christian -LSB- who is to
Nietzschean Ludovici	PERSON	the only possible gentleman -RSB- , is simply the voice of his ancestors in his breast . ''

		In order that modern consciences and tastes may be puri - fied , we must have aristocrats entirely immune from the dirty work of the world .

		And so these innocents are to be our guardians much as the swooning mid-Victorian women in Tennysonian harems nurtured the morals of the twentieth century conservatives and para - sites .

		This cult of the innocents , together with Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's utter loathing for machin - ery , we must always expect from the senti - mental aristocrat .

		Machinery is often sor - did .

		True , the best democrat will admit that machinery has reduced the world to a new and singularly terrible form of economic slavery .

		But it would never occur to an aris - tocrat to ask whether this might not be a transitional period , whether we could not make machinery our slave .

		The sentimental aristocrats have much in common with two famous characters once described with much shrewdness by a certain vulgar tinker who was the son of a tinker : I saw then in my dream , that when Christian was got to the borders of the
Shadow of Death	ORGANIZATION	, there met him two men , children of them that brought up an evil report of the good land -LRB-
Num	ORGANIZATION	.

		XIII . -RRB-

		, making haste to go back ; to whom Christian spake as fol - lows : - Chr .

		Whither are you going ?

		Men .

		They said , Back !

		back !

		and we would have you do so too , if either life or peace is prized by you .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 545 Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	caps the climax with a defence of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's double code of morality for princes .

		Heaven forbid that such an admir - able book as `` The Prince '' should fill modern readers with the devil-exorcising fear with which it inspired Elizabethan dramtists !

		But even irrational people are to-day growing more and more numerously aware of the eth - ical impossibility of double standards within the field of morals , whether sexual or politi - cal .

		In the last three chapters , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	turns more particularly to his constructive work : `` The Aristocrat as an Achievement , '' `` The Aristocrat in Practice , '' `` What is Culture ? ''

		Now , at last , he is fain to throw himself on the protection of `` the fanatics and followers of Science '' who , you will remember , `` are not the representatives '' of `` the princi - ple of aristocracy '' because `` their taste is too indefinite '' and their conclusions too slowly reached .

		If one were to derive his notion of science from the citations that follow in Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, one would be compelled to agree with Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's earlier mood of contempt and give prompt allegiance to his more funda - mental principle , which is to leap before you look .

		One would feel absolutely compelled to cite
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	,
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	, and
Ezra	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	does , to bolster up and amplify the laborious findings of modem sci - ence .

		One would cite , with all Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's disapproval of its radical tinge , the state - ment of Aristotle , who , in an age of deca - j dence , makes the fatal admission that `` Slaves have sometimes the bodies of freemen , some - times the souls . ''

		-LRB- The italics are mine -RRB- .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	has often blamed democracy justly for its excessive and vague individu - alism .

		But now , in his neo-aristocratic pro- gramme , he follows a Nietzschean individu - alism , different in some respects , but equally excessive and equally vague .

		With Reibmayr , he classifies man 's instincts `` under three heads .

		-LRB- A -RRB- the self - preservative , -LRB- B -RRB- the reproductive , and -LRB- C -RRB- the social , '' all of which , we are told , may be present in fairly well balanced or unequal degrees .

		It then becomes necessary to define Will .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	-LRB- evidently recreating the history of human thought from his insides , much as a spider weaves a web -RRB- astounds us with the assurance that `` the whole discussion about free will and determinism could only have arisen in a weak and sickly age . ''

		With his healthy aristocratic mind , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	dis - poses of the trivial problem in about three pages .

		His conclusion , `` determinism from j within , '' seems to be a sort of crude teleolog - ical determinism , a conception of a self deter - mined by his own loyalty , but a loyalty based not on reason but on certain unplumbed emo - tions , `` a voice within his own heart , '' a loyalty directed towards heaven knows what goal .

		It is easy to understand from this why Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, when as in these later chap - ters he chooses to tolerate science for conven - ience sake , warns us that all the conclusions to which biology and anthropology have slowly and blunderingly attained , all their conclu - sions and infinitely more , were present in the sure instincts of Brahmans , Egyptians , and other races of uncontaminated intuitional - ism .

		Nothing daunted by the daedalian turns of Mendelian law , and in fact ignoring Mendelianism altogether , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	now proceeds to cite his few adopted scientists in proof of the supreme necessity for in-breeding within a family or caste .

		While he admits that occasional judicious cross-breeding is necessary , he holds that wanton cross-breed - ing has been the chief cause of the decadence of all the good races of past and present , and now threatens the English aristocracy .

		He would find not a few students of genetics who would listen respectfully to his conclusions were they stated with anything like temper - ance and with a reasonable amount of evi - dence .

		But although I could well imagine myself as ignorant of these fascinating humanistic sciences as Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	himself , I find that my meagre knowledge is enough to assure me that his procrustean treatment of biology and anthropology would make many of the most reckless of `` the fanatics and fol - lowers of science '' gasp .

		But Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, I suppose , would remind me that he has sup - plemented the results of the scientists from the sure instincts of Osiris , the Ptolemies , the Brahmans , the
Jewish Levites	PERSON	, and many others whose examples and whose lore he now cites with great profusion .

		Only , when he says that the Brahman practice of not insult - ing but merely avoiding drunkards , lepers , `` those who subsist with shopkeeping , '' `` a man with deformed nails or black teeth , '' etc. , when Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	cites such conduct as `` more merciful and more practical than the methods of isolation , segregation and sterili - sation proposed by the eugenists , '' I find myself wondering on what grounds Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	finds modern science by contrast to be so `` bungling '' as he so often implies and says .

		Also , if this divine instinct of the Egyptians ,
Brahmans	LOCATION	,
Levites	PERSON	.

		early Greeks , Roman patricians , and others taught them to avoid resorting to cross-breeding , except judi - ciously , when their in-breeding threatened exhaustion , I find myself wondering what it was , either in the way of in-breeding or cross - 546 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	breeding , that impelled this divine instinct into that contamination which has recurred in all his great races which fill our modern thought with deep brooding over the tragic cycles of human progress .

		Lax cross-breed - ing , says Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, causes the deteriora - tion of the divine instinct .

		But what first causes these divine instincts to lend them - selves to the practice of lax cross-breeding ?

		Here again we seem to find ourselves at the heart of that fatalism which has sooner or later bred self-destruction in all aristocracies yet conceived , and which , as far as I can see , vitiates the very centre and basis of Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's creed .

		Nor can I be appeased when Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, who has had so much to say about the `` flour - ishing life '' of aristocracy produced by '' lucky strokes of nature , '' asserts that it is `` one of the most incontrovertible facts of science and human experience , that there is extraordinar - ily little chance of accident in the production of great and exceptional men . ''

		Just how , I wonder , does he distinguish between the instincts of `` most European aristocracies '' which have `` always relied more or less indo - lently and ignorantly upon chance '' and the divine instincts of his favorite ancients , except in degree ?

		For the best that can be said of his ancient aristocrats is that in some cases their instincts seem to have kept them longer from instinctively falling into that practice of cross-breeding which was their ruin .

		One is not surprised to find Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	, after an interesting and plausible attack on primogeniture , admitting the need of heavy gambling in propagating , even when it is practised on the most divinely instinc - tive basis .

		You must have plenty of children , if you are an aristocrat .

		Then , from the midst of failure , at least one great man will arise .

		Once more Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	circles back to an onslaught on decadent British aristocracy .

		He shows how from the days of the younger
Pitt	PERSON	there has been a tendency to increase the peers of
England	LOCATION	on economic and other capri - cious incentives .

		He advocates an educa - tion of lower classes placed in the hands of active aristocrats who would weed out in the early grades all those who seem unworthy to the traditionalizing gaze of aristocrats and to the myopia inevitable in their native habitat and environment .

		Finally , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	has altogether avoided the questions which would arise in any philosophy of history , which should command the attention of any theorist on human prog - ress .

		Has it been for the worse that aristo - crats have faded and fallen ?

		Would it have been better if the world had always had noth - ing but the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	or nothing but the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	?

		Does the human race at large move towards `` that one , far-off divine event , '' and does the `` whole creation '' move towards it ?

		Or should we agree to take a severely empirical attitude , and regard this last question as full of temp - tations involving dangerous presuppositions or prejudices ?

		Should we hope for an era of unprecedented nationalistic individualism , and in-breeding not only physical but moral and aesthetic ?

		I know that such questions might seem naive to an advocate of the Marxian `` materialistic conception of history . ''

		I know they would seem impertinent to the so-called `` scientific historian , '' with his wor - ship of
Von Ranke	PERSON	and his amazing notion that the historian can deal with what he styles `` pure facts '' without even raising an eyebrow by way of interpretation .

		I am well aware , too , that many empiricists of a much finer sort than the old-fashioned followers of
Von Ranke	PERSON	and his successors would not be very much interested in my questions .

		And for the point of view of the most sensible empiri - cists I have the most cordial respect , though I can not , at least in my present stage of enlightenment , give them my poor bewild - dered allegiance .

		But Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	is clearly no empiricist .

		He is an emotional idealist .

		He is a philosopher-artist , or an artist-philoso - pher , and he is therefore under Druid bonds to pay attention to questions like those I have asked .

		If he does not ask them , his book is fundamentally meaningless .

		And I can not perceive that he asks them .

		BUDDHISM IN AKT .

		* Within its limitations as to space , Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	's `` Buddhist Art in Its Relation to Buddhist Ideals '' is an illuminating book .

		It comprises four lectures given at the Museum of Fine Arts ,
Boston	LOCATION	, in
January	DATE	and Feb - ruary ,
1914	DATE	, while the author , who is Pro- fessor of
the Science of Religion	ORGANIZATION	in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, was temporar - ily in the
United States	LOCATION	and occupying the chair of Professor of Japanese Literature and Life in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its bearing on the history of art , the theme of the lectures is an important one .

		The author 's treatment of it is thoroughly comprehending and clear in statement , and his book supplies a real need , as the information hitherto available * BUDDHIST ART IN ITS RELATION TO BUDDHIST IDEALS , with
Special Reference to Buddhism	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Four Lec - tures given at the Museum of Fine Arts ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		By
M. Anesaki	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Litt.D .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 547 is scattered through the pages of periodicals and costly publications to which few have access .

		Buddhahood signifies enlightenment .

		Hav - ing attained the infinitely expanded vision , the
Buddha Sakyamuni	ORGANIZATION	must have become the possessor of all knowledge .

		He must , there - fore , have foreseen the use that his followers would make of art in spreading the faith , and the influence that Buddhistic philosophy would have upon the development of the fine arts throughout the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , the view of art held by him and his immediate disciples was strictly hedonistic .

		Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	tries to get around this fact by asserting that `` Buddha was an artist , '' a statement which he immediately qualifies by adding `` not in the sense that he ever worked with brush or chisel , but in the sense that his perception of life was artistic . ''

		This may be dismissed as a bit of special pleading .

		There is nothing in
Sakya	LOCATION	's life as we know it , or in his teaching , to show that he realized the possibility of a mental uplift through the contemplation of physical beauty in any form .

		His mission was to spread spiritual illumination among his fellows , to break down the barriers of caste , and to establish the principle of human equality and brotherhood .

		His philosophy has been described as an interpretation and popularization of the Veda , made over into a moral code `` at once intuitive and prac - tical , '' the dominant idea being `` the attain - ment of salvation with one 's own mind . ''

		After the
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's death , his injunction to his followers to abjure the pomps and vani - ties of worldly life was interpreted in many ways .

		He had required all who adhered to his cult to shave their heads and put on priestly robes .

		And in the early years the brethren were forbidden to allow figures of human beings to be painted on monastery walls .

		Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	points out that as late as the reign of
King Asoka	LOCATION	, during the third century B. c. , the person of the Buddha was regarded as too sublime to be represented as a human figure , and was symbolized by such tilings as the holy wheel of eternal truth , or the tree under which he attained Buddhahood .

		But before long the priests found it neces - sary to their teaching to have `` something tangible to recall the magnetic influence of his presence . ''

		There is a tradition that in an endeavor to supply this need ,
Sakya	LOCATION	's bones were distributed among the eight kingdoms where his faith had been embraced , and were there enclosed in mound-like repositories known as stupa .

		But this failed of the desired effect , and led only to superstitious worship of the relics .

		Whether the making of sacred images began prior to the development of sculpture in
India	LOCATION	under Greek influence may never be known , for there is some reason to suppose that the earlier statues were of wood and have not been preserved .

		If tradition may be believed , the first of these was an image of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	carved by order of
Udayana	LOCATION	,
King of Kosambi	ORGANIZATION	, from wood of the sendan -LRB- Pride of
India	LOCATION	-RRB- tree .

		That some of the figures were of comparatively early date seems probable , | for among the adherents of the Hinayana schools that grew up in the centuries follow - ing
Sakya	ORGANIZATION	's death , dissensions arose , regard - ing them and the stupa , the votaries being divided in their opinion as to whether these things were or were not efficacious aids to salvation .

		Not until the second and
third centuries B.	DATE	c. is there clear evidence of any general patronage of artists and craftsmen by the Buddhist Sangha : not until the begin - ning of the Christian era do the types of Bud - dhist art begin to take definite form .

		At first we find , as Dr.
Coomaraswamy	PERSON	puts it , `` only the popular Brahmanical and animistic art : of the day , adapted to Buddhist require - ments . ''

		The earliest type to emerge is that I of the Buddha-yogin , the seated figure in the practice of
Yoga	ORGANIZATION	, `` seeking enlightenment and emancipation by meditation calculated to release the individual from empirical con - sciousness , '' until , as
Schelling	PERSON	expresses it , `` the perceiving self merges in the self - per - ceived . ''

		As Buddha reached his final enlightenment while seated in yogi fashion under the
Bodhi	LOCATION	; tree at
Gaya	LOCATION	, the cross-legged figure seated I upon a lotus-flower asana -LRB- support -RRB- became the most characteristic and symbolical out - ward representation of spiritual achievement , I and as such it has persisted through all the centuries down to the present day .

		Much has been written about the influence of the
Gandhara	LOCATION	sculptors during the period from the first to the fourth centuries
A. D.	PERSON	, when this classic conception was taking shape , but there can be little doubt that its importance ; has been over-rated .

		Dr.
Coomaraswamy	PERSON	; regards the
Gandhara	LOCATION	sculptures as the work of Greco-Bactrian craftsmen employed by the
Gandhara	LOCATION	kings to interpret Buddhist ideas ; and
Havell	PERSON	is probably right in his estimate that their art , so far as it is Greek or
Koman	PERSON	, is lifeless , and `` the more it becomes Indian the more it becomes alive . ''

		Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	, i however , says they represented
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	`` in all the beauty of an Apollo . ''

		The great development of Buddhist art came about through the evolution of Northern 548 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	Buddhism , the
Mahayana	LOCATION	, or Greater Vehicle .

		This school was the outcome of an emotional transformation which carried its votaries away from the purely intellectual concepts of
Sakya	LOCATION	and his early followers .

		It promulgated doctrines at variance with those taught by the Founder .

		It peopled the universe with Dhyani-Buddhas and
Boddhi	PERSON	- sattvas , and extended its metaphysical specu - lations until they embraced the idea of an Adi-Buddha as
Supreme Lord	ORGANIZATION	and Creator , and , under a new terminology , included the orthodox Hindu pantheon in the Buddhist hierarchy .

		Its ritual became elaborate , and was designed to put before the devotee vivid mental images of the divinities evoked .

		The
Mahayana	LOCATION	sutras represent an attempt of Buddhism to absorb the Brahmanistic creed .

		`` They are , '' says Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	, `` to leave untouched the metaphysical doctrines preached in them , descriptions in words of the pictures representing the glorious assembly of celestial and human beings around Buddha . ''

		Through their tacit approval of the worship of images , these sutras gave an impetus to the employ - ment of art in spreading the faith .

		The development that brought Buddhism into the closest union with art was , however , the rise of the
Yogacharya	LOCATION	, or Tantric sect .

		The essence of its special creed is that
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	lives in a spiritual world of the imagination whose secrets are veiled in mystery to the uninitiate .

		These secrets it professed to reveal through mystic formularies , and by `` vizualizing in pictures , statues , and rites , the symbolic or anthropomorphic manifestations of Buddha and of the various deities which are his emanations . ''

		It was the outgrowth of a cosmotheistic concept which Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	describes as `` the fundamental ideal common to nearly all branches of Buddhism , '' and concerning which he says : The final substratum of Buddhahood is , therefore , the cosmos , including the spiritual and material aspects , and
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	is the Lord who rules it , not from above , but from within .

		His spirit is the cosmic soul , which , like a seed , evolves out of itself all the phenomena of the universe .

		For concrete representations of this ideal world recourse was had to painting and sculp - ture and music .

		Much was made of the Man - dala or groups of sacred figures .

		The Sanskrit word signifies `` whole , '' `` circle , '' `` assemblage , '' etc. , but as applied to these pictures had the wider meaning of the cosmos symbolized in terms of its moving forces .

		The
Mandala	PERSON	were of four kinds : Maha-Mandala , representing Buddhas and Boddhisattvas with all their distinguishing marks and attributes ; Karma-Mandala , illustrating their actions ; Samaya-Mandala , showing their mudras , or mystic poses of hands and feet , and their various sacred belongings ; and the j Dharma-Mandala , setting forth the letters of the so-called Lancha alphabet as applied to them with symbolic meaning .

		These Mandala merged into one another on the principle of `` The whole in one and one in the whole , '' and from being considered merely as repre - sentations of the ideal world they were trans - figured by the mass of believers who came to look upon them as in themselves objects of worship .

		A history of Buddhist art being beyond Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	's purpose in this book , he does not attempt to trace the spread of the
Mahayana	LOCATION	doctrines from
India	LOCATION	into
Tibet	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and other countries on the continent of
Asia	LOCATION	, and its absorption of various pantheons into one cycle central in
Buddha	LOCATION	, but , with only casual reference to the importance of the works of the painters and sculptors of the T'ang and Sung dynasties , wrought under its influence , passes to the introduction , in the ninth cen - tury
A. D.	PERSON	, of
Mystic Buddhism	LOCATION	into
Japan	LOCATION	, where it was designated as Shingon or `` The True Word . ''

		The iconography of Shingon art , its signs and symbolic inventions , fur - nishes the subject of his third lecture ; but as `` the possible deities and symbols are as many as the atoms of the universe , '' he offers only a general view of the subject and brief descrip - tions of some of the figures most commonly represented by the artists .

		At the end of the chapter he touches upon the syncretic religion called Ryobu Shinto , which was an extension of the Shingon concept to include Shinto within its purview , as in
India	LOCATION	the Yoga - charya had gathered the Hindu divinities into its fold .

		The elaborate and richly colored paintings , noble statues , and ornate temples with their splendid furnishings and imposing rituals , of the mystic sects , represent only one phase of Mahaj ^ ana Buddhism .

		Equally characteristic is the idealistic and supremely poetic art that is the outcome of the contemplative school , known in
Japan	LOCATION	as Zen .

		This school lays special emphasis upon meditation .

		In the words of Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	, `` its adherents believed that to them had been directly transmitted the spiritual illumination of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and they cultivated its method of meditation simply and purely without admixture of mysterious rituals and doctrinal analysis . ''

		Its tenets were carried from
India	LOCATION	to
China	LOCATION	about 526 A. D. by
Bodhidharma	LOCATION	, the twenty-eighth and last Indian Patriarch of Buddhism , who became the first Patriarch of Zen Buddhism in
China	LOCATION	, where he was called Tamo .

		To the Japanese he is known as
Daruma	LOCATION	.

		He main -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 549 tained as a principle that one should not be ; bound by the words of the scriptures , and asserted that Buddhahood is not to be attained by works , but by the purity and wisdom that comes from meditation .

		It should , therefore , be sought in one 's own heart .

		The influence of this doctrine upon the Art of the Far East was profound and far-reach - > ing .

		A few sentences from what Dr.
Anesaki	PERSON	has to say about it tell the story very con - cisely , and serve also as an example of his lucid style .

		As a method of achieving a union of the individual soul with the cosmic spirit Zen training manifested itself in art of a transcendental kind .

		Naturalism and intuitionism enabled the Zenist not only to absorb the serenely transient beauty of nature , but also to ; express it , distinct from human passions and interests in placid dignity and pure simplicity ; while individu - alism , a necessary consequence of Zen practice , found expression in a vigor and freshness of artistic treat - ment implying always a touch of original genius .

		Thus the aesthetic sense developed by the culture con - sisted essentially in disinterested observation and penetrating insight which produced a feeling of inti - macy with the universe and caused man to mould his life and taste in accordance with the `` air-rhythm '' of i nature .

		Since , however , high attainment in Zen was limited to a few men of indefatigable persistence , the best products of its art showed an intellectual lofti - j ness suggestive of aristocracy .

		Yet its influence ; pervaded the lives of the people and moulded their perceptions in every branch of art , in the composi - tion of poems , the building of houses and furnishing i of rooms ; in methods of flower arrangement , of gardening , and even of preparing and drinking tea .

		Indeed there is in
Japan	LOCATION	hardly a form of thought or activity that Zen has not touched and inspired with the ideal of simple beauty .

		It would not be fair to the author of this j very interesting volume to criticize it for what it does not contain .

		Instead , it is to be com - mended for the extent of the information that lias been compressed within the space of four short lectures , and the clarity with which the : dominant ideas are made to stand forth .

		The book is illustrated with forty-seven full-page reproductions of paintings and statues , accompanied by explanatory text .

		The front - ispiece is a chromo-lithograph of the famous triptych of `` The Arnita Triad rising over Hills '' traditionally ascribed to
Eshin Sozu Genshin	PERSON	and now deposited in the
Imperial Museum	ORGANIZATION	,
Kyoto	LOCATION	.

		The other subjects are chiefly from paintings and sculptures in the Museum of Fine Arts ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		If the repro - i ductions are not , in every instance , satisfac - tory it is because many of the originals are ancient works which it is very difficult to photograph .

		This does not apply to the repro - duction of Zen paintings , which might be better .

		It must be said of them also , that not all of the works selected are of such merit as to warrant their inclusion .

		As for the two
Ukiyoe	ORGANIZATION	travesties of Buddhist subjects , they are quite irrelevant and would wisely have been omitted .

		And in the legend appended to Plate XLIV , instead of stating that the deity
Fugen	PERSON	`` is represented as a courtesan . ''

		it should have been put the other way around .

		But in spite of these shortcomings , the illus - trations form an important and most useful feature of the book .

		THE 3IOXROE DOCTBIXE INTERPRETED .

		* In the
year 1901	DATE	, Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	published in `` The American Historical Iteview '' a brief paper entitled `` The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and the Doctrine of Permanent Interest '' which went a long way toward clearing up the hazy notions upon the subject at that time prevalent .

		Other contributions of the sort have been made from time to time : and at last we have from Professor
Hart	PERSON	's facile pen a volume of ample proportions which comprises the most ambitious , and the most generally useful , treatise upon the sub - ject at present available in the English lan - guage .

		The first clue to the actual nature of the volume in hand is supplied by the sub-title , `` An Interpretation . ''

		What the reader expects to find , and does find , is far more than the
Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	's history .

		Of the seven `` parts '' into which the book falls , only three are purely historical .

		In the first of these are recounted the circumstances and events attending the original pronouncement of
1823	DATE	; in the second are recorded the fluctua - tions of American foreign relations from about
1827	DATE	to
1869	DATE	, together with the efforts of presidents , secretaries of state , and other public men `` to frame new forms of doctrine to correspond '' ; in the third the narrative is carried from
1869	DATE	to
1915	DATE	.

		MODERNIZING THE

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		550 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	been applied to a much wider range of objects than in its earlier history ... Its meaning and its immediate cogency are still uncertain and disputed . ''

		The causes of the obscurity which surrounds the subject are not difficult to discover .

		In the memorable message of
December 2 , 1823	DATE	, President
Monroe	PERSON	made certain assertions relative to the attitude of the
United States	LOCATION	toward the affairs of
Latin America	LOCATION	and of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	coast .

		The phrases employed were put forward `` for immediate consumption , in order to forestall difficulties then serious but now mostly passed by . ''

		But in succeeding decades the attempt was made , as it still is made , to apply these Monrovian phrases to every aspect of our international affairs to which , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , they can be regarded as pertinent .

		As necessity has arisen , or as inclination has led .

		presidents , secretaries of state , writers , and publicists have introduced glosses on the original Doc - trine , adding element to element of confusion .

		And it is difficult to say whether the grossest anachronisms and incongruities have arisen from the exploitation of these glosses or from the occasional impossible attempts to apply the phrases of
1823	DATE	literally to existing situ - ations .

		Underlying and antedating all of these more or less ephemeral and contradictory doc - trines , Professor
Hart	PERSON	finds `` a perpetual national policy which needs no authority from President
Monroe	PERSON	, or any later public man , to make it necessary or valid . ''

		It is `` the daily common-sense recognition of the geogra - phic and political fact that the
United States of America	LOCATION	; is by fact and by right more interested in American affairs , both on the northern and southern continents , than any European power can possibly be . ''

		For the ultimate basis of this `` American doctrine '' one must turn to the physical make-up of the American continent and the remoteness of the Americas from both
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	; and for the earliest deliberate expressions of the doctrine one must go back beyond Presi - dent
Monroe	PERSON	and Secretary
Adams	PERSON	to , at all events ,
Thomas Pownall	PERSON	's `` Memorial to the Sovereigns of
America	LOCATION	'' in
1781	DATE	and
John Adams	PERSON	's conversations with the British peace commissioner at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1782	DATE	, as well as the more familiar pronouncements of President
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Viewed in this way , the dec - larations contained in the
Monroe	PERSON	message of
1823	DATE	become , not a new and final statement of national policy , but a reiteration , adapted to contemporary circumstances , of a long-recog - nized principle of fundamental and continu - ous national interest ; and , in their varying guises , subsequent declarations by
Polk	ORGANIZATION	,
Cass	PERSON	,
Seward	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, Fish ,
Evarts	PERSON	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Olney	PERSON	,
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and Root have been only fresh assertions of the one abiding doctrine of `` permanent interest . ''

		For purposes of convenience this eternal doctrine may be denominated the `` Monroe Doctrine . ''

		But the user of the phrase must understand that in essence the doctrine was no more originated by
Monroe	PERSON	than by any one of a score of American publicists ; while in its form of expression it has ever been , and must ever be , changeable as the chameleon .

		It is easy for the author to demonstrate that men are as absolutely disagreed to-day concerning the meaning of the `` Monroe Doc - trine '' as they have been at any earlier time , and that so long as our foreign relations are managed in deference to a rule or theory of such uncertainty the
United States	LOCATION	will suf - fer in dignity and influence .

		That the
United States	LOCATION	has need of a Doctrine of some variety indeed , that the maintenance of a Doctrine is inevitable is regarded as axiomatic , and it becomes a question of the kind of Doctrine which is most desirable and of the form in which it shall be stated .

		The Doctrine which is affirmed to be desirable is that which may be designated by Secretary
Evarts	PERSON	's phrase `` paramount interest , '' or the author 's `` per - manent interest . ''

		And the essentials of it are asserted to be -LRB- 1 -RRB- a declaration of the continuing interest of the
United States	LOCATION	that
Europe	LOCATION	shall obtain no new footholds in
America	LOCATION	, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an explanation that the reason for this interest is `` the honest repub - lican desire that our near neighbors may be given the chance to practice republican gov - ernment . ''

		The omissions will be observed to be significant .

		The
United States	LOCATION	is not to disclaim desire to annex territory south of the country 's present boundaries , `` because we have never recognized any limitation on that subject in the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and because we are now , from year to year , pick - ing up territory which is not likely ever to see independence again . ''

		In the next place , the principle of the two spheres must be given up , because the
United States	LOCATION	has become `` a Canal power , a
Pacific	LOCATION	power , and an Asiatic power , '' and must remain such .

		And , finally , there is no longer to be pretence that the Doc - trine is international law , public law , inter - American law , or indeed law at all , `` except in the sense of the physical sciences . ''

		The Doctrine is not law for the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, `` because none of them is required as an individual to believe and obey . ''

		It is not law for the Latin-American states , for they did not make it and they
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL resent every part of it that imposes limits upon what they might otherwise do as sov - ereign nations .

		It is not law for other for - eign nations , but simply `` a warning of the disagreeable things that may happen to them if they ignore it . ''

		Even in this moderate form , the Doctrine , !

		it is asserted , will be difficult , if not impos - sible , to maintain by peaceful means .

		``
Unless Europe	LOCATION	is about to enter on a new regime of international understandings and good will , , which seems very doubtful , the Doctrine is likely to be tested by some ambitious military power .

		For such a contest the naval prepara - tion of the
United States	LOCATION	is insufficient and her military organization is preposterous .

		Either the country must face the responsibil - ity which it assumes and prepare itself accordingly , or it must give up the Doctrine . ''

		But giving up the Doctrine , the author con - tends , will not be so easy ; and not even by such a course can peace be assured .

		`` The Doctrine will not give up the
United States	LOCATION	; for European settlements in
America	LOCATION	can only be made by war upon American countries , which would inevitably involve the
United States	ORGANIZATION	sooner or later , with or without a Doc - trine . ''

		The conclusion to which the author comes is , therefore , that the present demand for military and naval preparedness is well founded , and he rounds off his luminous exposition with a few telling arguments in its behalf .

		On its face , the view of things which ' is expressed seems pessimistic , and even pan - icky .

		Yet in consideration of the many hap - , penings since
August , 1914	DATE	, which had been asserted to be , and were generally believed to be , altogether impossible , one hesitates to demur .

		At the least .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	's char - acterization of the status of the Americas in j relation to the affairs of the world at large will provoke much thought and discussion .

		Mr.
Charles Sherrill	PERSON	is a former minister to
Argentina	LOCATION	, and in his `` Modernizing the j Monroe Doctrine '' he writes from first-hand i knowledge of Latin American sentiment and policy .

		Upon the subject of Pan-American - ism he feels deeply and speaks forcefully .

		; His arguments in favor of the cultivation of j the Pan-American spirit are irrefutable ; although in his enthusiasm he occasionally ventures assertions of somewhat extravagant character .

		The most noteworthy feature of his book is , however , not the appeal for Pan - American cooperation , but certain novel and even radical proposals concerning the mode of attainment of peace and comity in the
Western	LOCATION	world .

		In his contention that the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	stands in need of modernization to bring it clearly into conformity with the times , and of fresh definition to dispel the misunder - standings that have gathered about it in the past , Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	is in substantial agreement with Professor
Hart	PERSON	and other recent writers .

		It is insisted by him , further , that now is peculiarly the time for such reconstruction and for drawing the twenty-one American republics into closer relations .

		It is his plan for accomplishing this end that specially enlists attention .

		This plan embraces a series of actions working out in the erection of a Pan-American `` triangle of peace , '' an inter - national arrangement guaranteed to preserve the
United States	LOCATION	and her sister republics from the menace of European or Asiatic aggression and from the ravages of interna - tional war .

		The base of the triangle is to be supplied by a more substantial harmony among the Western republics ; and the joint mediation of the
United States	LOCATION	and the A. B. C. powers in the Mexican situation in
1914	DATE	is cited as evidence that the desired condition of comity is being attained .

		The
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	side of the triangle is to be `` a completed
Monroe	PERSON	Doc - trine to prevent friction with
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		At this point the scheme as outlined by Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	becomes dubious , if not fantastic , and , in the reviewer 's opinion , quite breaks down .

		For , the completion of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	which is advocated involves persua - sion of the European powers forthwith to give up all of their surviving possessions in the western hemisphere -LRB- with the possible exception of
Canada	LOCATION	-RRB- and financial compen - sation of the powers for these territories should it be demanded by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Arguments presented by the author in defence of the practicability of this pro- posal , while ingenious , are in no wise con - vincing .

		The third step is the erection of the Western side of the triangle , to ensure peace on the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		It involves simply , we are told , `` practicing across the
Pacific	LOCATION	what the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	preaches . ''

		Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	considers this the easiest part of the task ; for all that is necessary is for the
United States	LOCATION	`` to stay at home and mind her own business . ''

		This , however , under conditions that have grown up , is asking a good deal particularly when it is explained that adop - tion of the course proposed would mean not only that the
United States	LOCATION	should discon - tinue the effort to maintain the Open Door in
China	LOCATION	but that she should give up the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		To facilitate the adoption of his plan , however , the author proposes the sur - render of
the Philippines	LOCATION	to
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
Denmark	LOCATION	, in exchange 552 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	for the liberation of the colonies at present held by these powers in the western hemis - phere !

		It must be said in the author 's favor that in some quarters this last suggestion has been accorded support .

		But to most men it must yet appear chimerical .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	always writes something worth reading .

		She is always -LRB- it would seem -RRB- so really interested in life as she knows it and in a broad way so pleased with it , that her report of it is worth listening to .

		The first few pages of ``
Nathan Burke	PERSON	'' were enough to show a competent observer that a new planet had somehow got itself together out of the nebulous chaos of fiction writers which jars and joggles about nowadays , and started off in some sort of orbit .

		The precise nature of this orbit has not yet been calculated by our literary astronomers ; it would seem not to be comet-like or to have the wholly reliable characters of some other literary luminaries .

		There are .

		those who think that ``
Nathan Burke	PERSON	'' is finer than anything that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has done since ; that was perhaps because the historic element gave a sort of romantic flavor that many people like .

		There are also those who think that `` The Rise of Jennie Gushing '' is her best book , which may come from the particular interest that is undoubtedly felt by the present literary generation in following out the story of some - body 's life .

		In `` The Rudder '' Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has neither of these advantages , besides which she has elected to make something of a diffi - culty for herself by having , as she puts it herself , several heroes .

		It might also be said that the symbolic name of her novel does not seem -LRB- at least to one sympathetic reader -RRB- really to show the course of the book ; it seems to be a rudder , to make a feeble joke , that does not do much steering .

		In spite of these disadvantages , largely self - imposed , Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	is as obviously herself in `` The Rudder '' as in her other books .

		She is really so interested in life as it goes on about her that no passionate delight in allur - ing fancy and no deep resolution of the troubles of the present generation and no one of the current catchwords which nowadays * THE RUDDER .

		stand for ideas , in fact that nothing can distract her from putting down her view .

		She may be called old-fashioned ; people may say they do not care for phases of life in a small metropolis of the central states .

		But Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	is not by any means a purveyor of local color ; the orator and the baseball player and the contractor are really national types .

		In the dreadful Mrs.
Maranda	ORGANIZATION	she emerges into the sphere of general humanity .

		And the other chief figures , the novelist and the young lady , whatever they are , are not particularly typical of the central states .

		So Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has the main thing to her credit , a fine material ; though she lacks in this book the molding power of one sort or another , the power of shaping things into just the right form , which some people seem to have acci - dentally , and which others seem to have as a matter of conscious art .

		She does not give an encouraging view of life .

		It must be that there are a great many handers-out of balderdash like
T. Chauncey Devitt	PERSON	; one can hardly imagine otherwise .

		But he is a sad figure for all that .

		So is
Amzi Loring	PERSON	.

		It may be doubtful if there are many millionaires ' sons who become professional ball-players ; but there certainly are many young gladiators very like him , both in the college world and out .

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's types are pretty true , so true , indeed , that it may be fancied that they are too much the crea - tion of the general idea and too little of the particular impression so needful for art .

		Whether of one kind of another , they all together the walking delegate , the .

		labor - leader , the bright boy , the base-ball player , the millionaire , and a number more give rather a dull idea of life which is hardly lighted up by anything else .

		Certainly Mr.
Cook	PERSON	, the novelist , presents little more than an amused tolerance , and
Nellie Loring	PERSON	the social worker has only a pained feeling that she will find out about it all some time .

		It is not , of course , the duty of the novelist to be optimistic , nor is optimism as a duty a very interesting thing in fiction .

		But almost everybody feels that there is something worth while in life , something beyond mere stoical endurance : and if one 's novelist does not per - ceive anything , one believes there must be a false view somewhere .

		So I think that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has this time not got her focus quite right .

		Whether her focus be right or wrong , her book is immeasurably nearer truth than is Mr.
W. H. Wright	PERSON	's `` A Man of Promise . ''

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	was writing a different kind of novel for one thing , and at best would not have had the kind of realism in which Mrs.
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 553 Watts excels .

		But it is only in a way that he himself possibly did not plan that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	appears to me to give in any sense a true note of the world to-day .

		His chief figure and Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's
T. Chauncey Devitt	PERSON	, though superficially very different , are really men of much the same intellectual type , unconscious intellectual charlatans both , play - ing , the one to the vast mediocre audience of our country , the other to the much smaller set which prides itself on being cultivated or perhaps here one should say `` cultured . ''

		Stanford West , the man of promise , is con - stantly presented to us as a man of ideas , and evidently seemed so to himself and to those about him .

		It is clear , however , from the book that he was nothing of the sort .

		He conceived himself as one whose thought could dissolve the present structure of society and construct another .

		But he says and does noth - ing that gives any such idea .

		Men of that kind do not keep their thought for one or two books or newspaper articles : they talk , act , live so that people know that there is some - thing to them .

		Stanford West is said to have published a book which `` stripped the illusion and sanctity from the whole fabric of life and replaced them with doctrines which seemed to reverse the accepted moral code . ''

		Yet nothing that he says or does strips the illusion or sanctity from any part of the fabric of life .

		It surely does not strip the illusion or sanctity from the relation of sex -LRB- which is the only part of the fabric of life in which he had the slightest interest -RRB- that a young man should make his beginnings in such things with services of girls from the street , should go on with two -LRB- consecutive -RRB- mis - tresses , follow with a wife , leave her for a third mistress , and come back to his wife .

		Stanford West was `` a man of promise '' just as
T. Chauncey Devitt	PERSON	was .

		He talked as if he had ideas , as if he were an intellectual giant ; whereas he really was a muddle-headed sensualist .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has made a mistake in telling us that he wrote a beautiful play full of the Greek spirit .

		There is nothing in the book to show that
Stanford West	ORGANIZATION	had any real comprehension of Greek culture .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is also mistaken in telling us that West wrote either articles or books which criticized the present social structure in a destructive and a constructive manner .

		Such ' a man could have done nothing of the sort , though he might easily have thought he had , and very probably told Mr.
Wright	PERSON	that he had .

		Such people often think more highly than they ought to think of their own doings .

		The chief difference between these two charlatan-rhetoricians is that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	-LRB- of course -RRB- does not believe in hers , while Mr.
Wright	PERSON	solemnly and even pathetically takes his hero seriously .

		I suppose the reason for this is that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has long been inter - ested , amused , astonished , disgusted , allured by the antics of such people and their unfort - unate audiences ; so that finally she created the character by a species of necessity .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, on the other hand , has taken a stock figure , a common and conventional character of our generation , the wonderful intellec - tual and social heretic , and has tried to tell us how such a person would act .

		But he has not even studied the conventional type care - fully enough .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	also , and perhaps primarily , wishes us to understand that a man of genius will find it hard to arrange his relations with women so that they will not interfere with his more important affairs .

		But this is a matter which has been dealt with so often of late that it does not seem to call for especial discussion here .

		Those who do not like either good or bad books like the above may be tempted by two other books of a very different character .

		In `` Frey and His Wife '' and `` The Portion of a Champion , '' Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	and Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe have caught the spirit , the one of the old
Norse Saga	ORGANIZATION	, and the other of the old Irish Hero-story .

		I am perhaps too bold in regard to Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe 's book , for I have never really read much of the literature that evidently inspires him .

		But his book seems as if it must be right .

		I would like to find some faults : I feel that the utterances of the shannachies and brehons should be given in triads instead of quatrains .

		There is something strangely distinctive in a triad , for example : Hast thou heard what
Garselit	PERSON	said , The Irishman whom it is safe to follow ?

		`` Sin is bad , if long pursued . ''

		That is not exactly Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe 's doc - trine ; yet he , like
Garselit	PERSON	, is in this tale an Irishman -LRB- as I guess -RRB- whom it is quite safe to follow , at least in pursuit of amusement .

		Then I feel as if some of the adventures and incidents were a little conventional .

		But that , to tell the truth , is one of the characteristics of the Bed Book of Ulster -LRB- if that , by chance , be a correct name -RRB- or the Book of the
Dun Cow	ORGANIZATION	, as of a good deal of fiction since .

		So fault-finding comes really to little ; if one likes stories of this sort , as many do , one will like Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe 's , for it is a very good one .

		`` The Portion of a Champion , '' however , has more to it than a sequence of adventure , good or bad .

		It is in its implications the picture 554 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	of an old civilization now long passed away , a civilization very different from ours , so different indeed that it is wellnigh impossible for us really to imagine it , however much we may be amused or attracted by some of its details .

		It has been the fashion for a good while in the neo-Celtic group to look back to those days with a vague sentiment of desire , as though there were something there that might be restored to the life of our own time .

		No pictures of Oisin or of Deirdre have given me so much of an idea of a something worth while in that old Celtic otherworld as this tale of adventure by Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe .

		Deeply engrained in the minds of those people was the respect for law .

		Not very good law , perhaps , and good or bad not always easy to get at ; but such as it was , whether found in custom , in poem , or in decree , it was a dom - inating factor in life .

		That in itself was a good thing : to have some really steadfast guide for life , even if it were no better than the rather rigid guide of law .

		Mr.
o Sullivan	PERSON	tighe is aware of other guides , and he pre - sents his champion as once or twice coming under the influence of that other great guide of life which has gradually subverted the idea of law without as yet imposing itself uni - versally in its place , namely , the guide of life which brought
St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	to
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		That is something which made a great change in the world , both in the social tradition of ancient
Erin	PERSON	and in the Stoic discipline of
Rome	LOCATION	which the Champion met with in his expedition into
Gaul	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's `` Frey and His Wife '' is a most entertaining saga , written with all Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's skill in getting into the form and spirit of ancient ways of word and thought .

		It is a very curious story .

		Beginning with some unimportant matter about
Osmund Dint	PERSON	, useful merely in showing how things came about , the real story is about a man named
Gunnar	PERSON	, who fled from
Norway	LOCATION	across to
Sweden	LOCATION	in the days of
Olaf Triggvason	PERSON	.

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	he fell in with some people who held a god
Frey	ORGANIZATION	in great esteem .

		Frey was a fine - looking god made of wood , and handsomely painted and clothed .

		He was married to an attractive girl , and blessed the fields and crops .

		The saga tells how
Gunnar	PERSON	became concerned in this strange combination .

		There may be some deep hidden meaning in the story , though I judge not .

		It seems to be what it is on the surface , an amusing and astonishing tale of a simple kind of life .

		That is a good kind of story to tell , for in it the writer can say all sorts of things that are interesting .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, of course , is equal to the opportunity .

		B KIEFS NEW BOOKS .

		Leaders in ^ * s now nearly seven hundred and
Ireland	LOCATION	's fight fifty years since the sons of
Nesta	LOCATION	for freedom .

		crossed the i r i s h Sea and began the conquest of
Ireland	LOCATION	on the suggestion of the English king .

		The process of subjugation was long and wearisome ; there have been many revolts on Irish soil , much blood has been shed in the name of Irish liberty , and apparently the end is not yet .

		These revolutionary uprisings have , however , as a rule ended disastrously , and have served merely to fasten the chains more securely on the necks of the restless Irishmen .

		Far more important has been the long and continuous parliamentary con - flict of the
last century and a half	DATE	, which has actually brought the Irish people in sight of the promised land .

		This phase of the struggle for free - dom in
Ireland	LOCATION	may be said to have been begun in
1759	DATE	, when
Henry Flood	ORGANIZATION	entered the Irish par - liament .

		Since that day there has been an unin - terrupted succession of brilliant and picturesque , though not always discreet , Irish political leaders in the parliaments of
Dublin	LOCATION	and Westminster .

		In a volume entitled `` The Irish Orators '' -LRB- Bobbs -
Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Claude G. Bowers	PERSON	has brought together a series of studies of the personalities and careers of the more eminent among these leaders , which taken together give a continuous , though very incomplete , `` history of
Ireland	LOCATION	's fight for freedom . ''

		Mr.
Bowers	PERSON	has selected nine of the leading agitators of the period covered , and the list is one that every Irishman is likely to approve .

		It comprises
Henry Flood	ORGANIZATION	, the spokes - man of the Irish `` Volunteers '' ;
Grattan	PERSON	, whom Fox called the `` Irish Demosthenes '' ;
Curran	PERSON	, the great advocate of Irish rights at the bar of jus - tice ;
Lord Plunkett	PERSON	, who led the fight against the
Act of Union	ORGANIZATION	in
1800	DATE	;
Robert Emmet	PERSON	, who headed the ill-considered uprising of
1803	DATE	;
Daniel O'Con	PERSON	- nell , the `` Liberator '' ; General
Meagher	PERSON	, who was involved in the revolutionary movement of
1848	DATE	, and later won fame in our own civil war ;
Isaac Butt	PERSON	, who led the Irish membership in parliament just before the organization of the
Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	party ; and
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	.

		The larger part of the work is , however , devoted to the careers and achievements of
Grattan	LOCATION	,
O'Connell	PERSON	, and
Parnell	PERSON	.

		In these essays Mr.
Bowers	PERSON	does not pretend to give biographical sketches ; his discus - sions are rather in the form of appreciations , attempts to determine what each one of his sub - jects has contributed to the cause of Irish freedom .

		The author writes in a glowing , vigorous , and eloquent style , and has produced a most interesting work ; but the instincts of the historian , whose purpose is to present all the truth , he apparently does not possess .

		There is another side to the Irish question , which is also important , but which Mr. .

		Bowers wholly ignores .

		One is also led to feel that in his discussion of the merits of his heroes he has not always preserved a proper balance .

		One rises from the reading of the essay on
Grattan	PERSON	with the feeling that in him Irish oratory reached its greatest perfection ; but a little further on we meet the statement that `` the Irish race has not
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 555 given the world a greater orator than
John Philip Curran	PERSON	'' ; and in the essay on
O'Connell	PERSON	we are told that as an orator `` he was one of the most marvel - ous the world has known . ''

		There can be no doubt that all these nine men were masters .

		of eloquence , but it is generally wise to be sparing in the use of superlatives , even when discussing Irish oratory .

		iceg ig ^
Henry Joneg Ford	ORGANIZATION	, g ``
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	'' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , even though it bears as sub-title , `` The Man and his Work . ''

		But with so diligent and productive a worker the work is the man , and the man is the work , to a great extent .

		Accordingly the larger part of the book is given to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's record as an educator , his published writings , his entrance into public life , his governorship of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, and , in six successive chapters , his presidency of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		One chapter has to do with his personal traits , and the book ends with `` a mid-career appreciation . ''

		As a writer Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has accomplished an amount of solid work unsuspected by many .

		In the
Princeton University Library	ORGANIZATION	is a bibliography of these published writings from the time he entered
Princeton	LOCATION	as a student to the day he resigned its presidency to become governor of
New Jersey	LOCATION	; and this list , though admittedly incomplete , con - tains seventy-five entries showing a liberal range of scholarly interests with a due measure of con - centration and specialization .

		As an administrator in high office he is , as was to have been expected , represented as * conspicuously successful .

		A ten - dencj r to not unnatural and not unpardonable excess of eulogy appears in such passages as this reference to a public utterance of his on the tariff question : `` Probably no other presidential utter - ance ever had such a tremendous reverberation throughout the country . ''

		Illustrative also of the tone of the book is the following : `` With the war still going on it would be rash to make any pre - diction as to the permanence of any arrangement , but the indications are that President
Wilson	PERSON	has successfully vindicated neutral rights in the midst of the greatest war the world has ever known . ''

		His administration has been of so high an order `` that the character of the presidential office will be permanently affected . ''

		And , finally , as a last word at the end of the closing chapter , ``
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's
Administration	ORGANIZATION	will figure as the begin - ning of a new era . ''

		Appended is Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's utterance of three years ago on the eligibility of a president to reelection , and on the length of the presidential term .

		Four portraits of the subject of the book are inserted .

		Mountain scenery and mountain art .

		The lover of mountainous country will welcome Professor
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	's `` The Mountain '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , in which the author , regarding the mountains as pictures as well as matter in evolution , reveals a great deal to those who observe with less knowl - edge , if not with less ardor .

		Beginning `` From Afar , '' Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	, in Chapter I , approaches the distant Rockies from the great prairie , and in Chapter II he approaches them from afar in another sense from the nebular hypothesis and the planetessimal theory .

		These introductory chapters are followed by pains - taking discussions of the natural appearances of `` The Hills , '' `` The Timber-Line , '' `` The Uplands , '' `` Mountain Waters , '' `` Glaciers and Avalanches , '' `` The Snow-bine , '' etc. .

		The following extract , relating to the beautiful , graceful bines of hills -LRB- as contrasted with `` the abrupt line of a splintered mountain ridge '' -RRB- , illustrates the author 's pene - trating comment : `` Now , these lines of beauty are shown to the best advantage only on sparsely cov - ered hills that is , hills devoid of thick brush or trees .

		The heather of the Scotch hills or the grass of the English hills along the sea does not per - ceptibly check the flow of the bines , but the trees of the
Harz	LOCATION	or the Catskills muffle and confuse .

		As soon as timber covers the slopes the lines are softened , weakened , perhaps destroyed .

		It is pos - sible in sculpture to place drapery over the human figure and make it reveal the very thing it covers ; but you can not have foliage covering the hills and still show through it the rock structure or the earth curves beneath it . ''

		One of the most interesting chapters is the last one , in which Professor Van Dyke asks why the painters have not succeeded in following
Ruskin	PERSON	in the mountains .

		His answer is that high mountains are not pictorial .

		`` The qualities of sublimity in the mountains , such as bulk and mass , are the very qualities that can not be realized or placed upon canvas . ''

		In particular , `` the quality of looming in the peak '' can not be rendered by the painter .

		Again , the decorative aspect of a picture is unmanageable when the subject is a mountain .

		So , too , the colors lead to ineffectiveness , being too cold there are too many whites , blues , and purples .

		And ' again , '' The light has little or no warmth and is too clear , too penetrating .

		It robs the scene of all mystery and is inclined to be glaring . ''

		All of these diffi - culties have been minimized with great skill in the beautiful reproduction of a photograph of `` The Weisshorn from above
Tasch Alp	ORGANIZATION	, '' which serves as an impressive frontispiece .

		The book appears at a strategic moment : many a perfervid mount - aineer , and
summer	DATE	cottager , and week-ender will take a copy with him to the unpaintable mountains .

		It is not a simple matter to convey the spirit and message of '' The Psy - chology of the Unconscious '' -LRB-
Mof	ORGANIZATION	- fat ,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a large volume by Dr.
C. G. Jung	PERSON	of
the University of Zurich	ORGANIZATION	.

		The explana - tory titles , `` A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido : A Contribution to the History of the Evolution of Thought , '' are but modestly helpful .

		The whole is a significant example of the Freudian psychology of the day .

		It is introduced with an admirable statement of this psychology by the translator , Dr.
Beatrice M. Hinkle	PERSON	, which is itself a worthy contribution .

		The libido is generalized into the underlying striving which sustains life and animates resolve and con - duct .

		It derives vitality from the deepest phases 556 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	of nature , most centrally and richly from the sex impulses which preserve the race and set the pat - tern for desire .

		The major argument of the book maintains that the symbolism of myth is a racial record of the libido , a revelation of the subcon - scious workings and the mechanism by which they attain expression .

		A wide sweep of myths and cults , fables and traditions , religious beliefs , and mystic practices is drawn upon to enforce this view .

		Parallel with this is the interpretation of a series of impressions , moments of inspiration leading to poetical effusions , on the part of one
Miss Miller	PERSON	.

		These , when subjected to the
Freud	PERSON	- ian interpretation , are held to reflect the same type of subconscious emanations of the libido as have given rise to the ancient myths .

		A common source in the libido , a common transformation by the poetic or mystic symbolism , and consequently a common significance , underlies the individual and the racial expression .

		This thread of argument is crossed and intertwined with others until an intri - cate design results , which the reader will find it difficult to follow ; for symbolism is a treacherous guide to proof ; and sympathy , if not preposses - sion , is needed to keep one on the trail .

		The view that the dream-thought , the revery , the inspira - tion , the emotional impression , the poetic theme , is as natural , as intimate a type of thinking as the conscious and accredited argument , will find assent ; but the view that such complex symbol - isms are constantly at work , and that the libido , however generously interpreted , is ever seething and breeding , and through this indirect escape sat - isfies its repressed yearnings , is hardly so accept - able .

		That the '' Song of
Hiawatha	LOCATION	'' and the myths of
Brahma	LOCATION	, the Christian mysteries and the classic wonder-tales , are likewise products of the Freudian activities of the psyche is rather a difficult and comprehensive thesis .

		The courage to maintain it and the erudition to carry through the exposition are the notable qualities of this remarkable book .

		Notwithstanding that
Wordsworth	PERSON	`` l -LCB- ZS ?

		has written the longest autobio - graphical poem in the language , to read that poem is not really the best way to begin acquaintance with its author .

		As
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	pointed out long ago ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	is one of the few poets to be seen at his best through judicious selections rather than through the whole body of his verse , which was written during an industrious life of eighty years .

		The reader who happens to make a beginning by way of `` The Idiot Boy '' or the prologue to ``
Peter Bell	PERSON	'' is unlikely to be tempted further .

		Thus a book on `` How to Know Words - worth '' would be not without value at any time ; but there could scarcely be a happier moment than the present for Dr.
C. F. Winchester	PERSON	's volume with that title .

		For it is in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	that the Englishman of to-day will find expression of the deepest needs of the present hour .

		Nowhere does love of country find loftier utterance than in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's splendid sonnets ; no poet is more sure that his countrymen are `` sprung of
Earth	LOCATION	's first blood , have titles manifold . ''

		The best of these sonnets were written one hundred and four - teen years ago , at a time when
Wordsworth	PERSON	feared that the brief security from the peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	was lulling Englishmen into indifference to all noble ends ; but they embody as ringing a call for to-day , toward loftier ideals and a higher national life .

		This is not to say that
Wordsworth	PERSON	can ever be termed , in any strict sense , a popular poet , a fact acknowledged by Dr.
Winchester	PERSON	in one of his early chapters , where he calls attention to the poet 's limitations .


Wordsworth	PERSON	had little sense of the poetic charm of movement or passion ; he had no voice for love or war , and no great delight in beauty for its own sake , apart from its moral suggestion ; he had a dull ear for the music of verse ; he lacked utterly any sense of humor .

		But granting all this , and not expecting from Words - worth things he can not give , no other poet finds so much of the highest kind of joy in the world .

		No on can drink deeply of his spirit without being kindled to a reverent delight that behind all the shows of earth and sky is a solemn Power and Presence to which our souls are akin .

		So , while
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetry will never speak to the busy crowd , it can render a better service than that , - it can take us away from `` the dreary inter - course of daily life , '' and set us in the solitude of nature as in a sanctuary ; it can infuse a healthy sympathy for the essential virtues of men , how - ever homely ; it can dilate the soul with thoughts as lofty and as pure as the naked open sky .

		To help toward a keener appreciation and a more immediate recognition of the real Wordsworthian mission is the purpose of Dr.
Winchester	PERSON	's book , and the author has succeeded admirably both in his sympathetic criticism and in his wisely chosen citations .

		The mystery of `` Patience Worth '' has risen to sud - '' Patience den popularity as a subject of Worth . ''

		discussion at dinner parties and afternoon teas .

		She is the heroine of a book by Mr.
Casper S. Yost	PERSON	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where the afore - said `` Patience Worth '' resides in the person of Mrs.
John H. Curran	PERSON	.

		`` Patience '' is the plan - chette personality of Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	, and in that capacity is the author of witty conversation , prose tales with a moral , and poetic revelations of more than common merit .

		These writings are for the most part in a quaint archaic style suggestive of the Elizabethan period of our literature .

		They reflect a strange acquaintance with the customs and ways of thinking of a by-gone age , and with the manner of expression then current , or a clever imitation thereof .

		And all this wealth of literary effusion comes in the form of painful letter-by - letter spelling of a ouija board under the manipu - lation of Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	's sensitive mind .

		Such phrases as the following , taken at random , illus - trate the language and the wisdom : '' Thee ` lt bump thy nose to look within the hopper '' ; `` Should thee let thy fire to ember I would fain cast fresh faggots . ''

		Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	in everyday life is a cul - tivated woman , not professionally literary ; she has never been to
Europe	LOCATION	, makes no pretence to his - torical knowledge , and preserves a discreet silence as to the source of her inspiration .

		However one
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 557 may view the value of the literary expressions , one can not but be impressed with the wealth and readiness of the output .

		The phenomenon is pre - sented rather neutrally , but with the strong impli - cation that it is viewed as `` a psychic mystery . ''

		It is certainly a remarkable human document that is here put together ; and yet it is presumably but an unusually rich example of subconscious devel - j opment .

		The data are meagre , and there is a curious avoidance of dates , places , and incidents ' that might be of evidential value .

		Much of the language is in the nature of studied mannerisms j with no claim to authentic correctness .

		Its devel - j opment is slow and gradual , suggestive of pro- tracted periods of incubation .

		The ideas and reflections are well within the capacity of a sen - sitive and absorbent mind .

		It is natural , under the volume of the evidence , to resort to hypotheses | that science knows not of ; but the story is just j as remarkable if viewed as the manifestation of I a rejected aspect of a complex personality that j has somehow yielded to or chosen this secretive form of expression .

		There may be a considerable number of persons who harbor mute and inglo - rious Miltonic aspects of their nature , which await only the invitation of a ouija board or other tap - ping of the subconsciously repressed storehouse to come to the light of day .

		It would be interesting to have a more explicit autobiographic confession of the wide-awake personality of Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	.

		insect lures ^ r -
Louis Rhead	PERSON	's `` American Trout - for trout and Stream Insects '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- presents trout-angUr * .

		^ j ^ g ^ o f studies by an artist - angler-entomologist , the difficulty of which can be appreciated only by those who have made some slight attempts in the same direction .

		It may be regretted that the author 's frequent reference to '' my line of lures '' and the mention in connection with each plate of `` choice flies tied from the author 's patterns and sold by his agents '' make the book more suggestive of the sporting goods empor - ium than of the stream-side .

		No one will grudge the author any financial returns that may come as a result of his labors ; but he might well have made this attractive book a pure delight to the sports - man , and reserved matters of a commercial savor for a catalogue .

		There is also something of `` effici - ency '' theorizing in the remark that `` by the sys - tematized method of fishing , success is sure . ''

		May the system of trout-fishing never be devised of which this can truthfully be said !

		Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	's contention is that artificial flies should be perfect imitations of the natural insects on which trout are feeding at the time of the cast .

		The angler who has had the occasional good fortune to - land a series of rises on an old fly battered and mutil - ated out of all semblance to anything living or dead may question whether trout are always such expert entomologists as Mr.
Jthead	PERSON	believes .

		Still , the theory has at least a show of plausibility ; and the fascination of trying to copy the natural insect will not be greatly lessened by the frank recogni - tion that , after all , lures are made for the fisher - man as well as for the fish .

		The studies in colors of the prevailing insects for each month are well - executed , and the descriptions are clear and sensible .

		Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	's observations were appar - ently made on eastern streams , but it is probable that most of the species will be found over the waters of the middle west .

		The chapter on ama - teur fly-dressing contains some useful hints , though the list of materials and accessories that the author deems necessary is appalling to a man who has had much pleasure and some apparent success in tying flies from an outfit kept in a single cigar - box .

		The last fifty of the 177 pages of the book describe a series of artificial frogs , minnows , etc. , designed by the author and light enough to be handled on a fly-rod .

		victoria Take a baker 's dozen blatant ills vievfoj woman ?

		f the sweated trades , add to them the vagaries of extremists among feminists , throw in greed and commercialism , infant mortality , prostitution , graft at the polls , and the passing of the home for full measure , call it feminism , then wonder why your cake is dough : and withal you have the mental process revealed by Mr. and Mrs.
John Martin	PERSON	in their volume on `` Feminism '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		First we are given the man 's point of view .

		Mr.
Martin	PERSON	uses his space - largely to show that woman in industry must sacrifice her - self , since business will not yield .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	, the woman of to-day , in factory and field , is giving the lie to this argument that she lacks strength to cope with industrial conditions ; in
America	LOCATION	humaner labor laws prevail because of woman , and if these can be extended to protect the laboring man as well , her sacrifice , though tremendous , will not be vain .

		Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	attempts a strong plea for a full expression of woman 's womanliness .

		She plans to establish a Utopian domestic guild to remove the `` stigma attaching to the servant 's calling '' ; for the unmarried mother , society should provide the `` offer of secrecy that the shame of exposure might not be made the price for human care '' ; woman , she warns , must never forget that her true place is `` the HOME '' -LRB- sic -RRB- .

		How smug it all is !

		No true feminist will deny that woman 's place is the home .

		What they aver is that no amount of capital let - ters will dignify that home so long as she makes it a place to sit in judgment on those less fortunate than she .

		Other things being equal , one may find the finest type of womanhood among those who obey the call of domesticity or motherhood , though placed by circumstances outside their own home or the pale of matrimony .

		To refer , in lump , to the stigma of the one or the shame of the other is crassly ante-diluvian , or pre - Victorian at least .

		Both authors , in taking feminism far too seriously , ignore two things : just now woman is bent on adventure , and she is demanding liberty .

		She wants suffrage and political freedom as a recog - nized inherent right , not as something man may grudgingly give .

		She has a huge wonder , a legit - imate curiosity , about the world man 's world , for which she is expected to train her children to be - come useful citizens .

		As a sex , she is in the awk - ward age , but there is not half the danger the
Martins	PERSON	anticipate that her pranks are going to capsize the boat .

		558 Belgian tributes to
Britain	LOCATION	.

		The great majority of the books written about the war prove how the belligerents can hate , but there is at least one which shows how they can love .

		`` A Book of
Belgium	LOCATION	's Gratitude '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is at once the record of the great-hearted generosity of the British Empire toward its martyred guests , and of the gratitude of the sufferers .

		The volume , beauti - fully illustrated with English scenes viewed through the eyes of Belgian artists , contains -LRB- in French and in English -RRB- contributions from prominent Belgians in all spheres of activity .

		After the reproduction of autograph letters from the royal family , contributions by ministers of state and other personages high in authority describe the different phases of the relief movement in which every part of the Empire has eagerly shared .

		Artists , musicians , professors , and men of letters , including
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Verhaeren	PERSON	, and Cammaerts , offer striking tributes to the welcome extended to them .

		The gratitude of the humble is shown in the numerous anecdotes sometimes humorous , more often pathetic which add much to the vivid - ness and sincerity of the book .

		Then there are occasional letters , straight from the trenches .

		In one a soldier on the Yser , who lays no claim to book-learning , addresses his benefactress as `` tu '' and `` vous '' in the same sentence .

		Doubtless he was constantly interrupted by speaking to comrades .

		There is but one poem , that entitled `` To England , '' written by
Fernand Severin	PERSON	.

		The first stanza gives the spirit of the whole collection : Nous etions sans appui : tu nous as secourus , Nous 6tions las , meurtris , saignants , bien qu ` invaineus : Tes soins ont adouci notre fiere detresse .

		Tu nous as fait benir , a force de tendresse , Ce que 1 ` heure presente avait pour nous d'amer .

		.

		Few men in American science have An American , .

		, ~ __ anthropologist , deserved greater credit than Dr. W J McGee .

		Without the advantage or prestige of a college training , he entered the field of professional science as an original investi - gator , and gained an enviable place and name .

		His earlier work upon the geology of northeastern
Iowa	LOCATION	, where he was born and reared , was of such quality as to bring him into relations with the
United States Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	.

		He won the respect and strong personal affection of the Director of the Survey , Major
John W. Powell	PERSON	, who came to depend greatly upon him .

		Dr.
McGee	PERSON	's most important scientific work was done in connection with the Survey .

		Major
Powell	PERSON	's last years were largely given to the
Bureau of American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, and here too he associated Dr.
McGee	PERSON	with himself and at his death left Dr.
McGee	PERSON	the Acting-Chief of the organization .

		Not the least important scien - tific service of Dr.
McGee	PERSON	was in connection with the department of Anthropology at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition	LOCATION	, where he had opportunity for the presentation of some of his most original ideas .

		Later , he became associated with the
Deep Waterways Commission	ORGANIZATION	, to which his full energy was being given when death took him .

		A man of force , originality , and ideas , Dr.
McGee	PERSON	deserves a monumental biography .

		The `` Life '' by his sister ,
Emma R. McGee	PERSON	, now privately printed , can not claim to be such , and is far from giving a satis - factory presentation of Dr.
McGee	PERSON	's career ; it gives little detail concerning his actual work .

		Two-thirds of the book is taken up with extracts from his writings .

		While these are interesting in themselves and in the glimpse they give us of the author , they occupy space that might have been better used for a fuller life story .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Without condensation of the text , a new edition of Professor
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	's `` Life of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	'' has been issued in one volume by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Distinctive features of the work were commented upon in these columns -LRB-
June 16 , 1912	DATE	-RRB- when the biography first ap - peared , and it now gains in value by the general revision to which it has been subjected .

		Unlike most publications of the sort ,
Miss Virginia Robie	PERSON	's `` Historic Styles in Furniture '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a volume which first appeared ten years ago and is now reissued in less expensive form , deals with the subject in its broader aspects , in its relation to background and setting .

		Delightful glimpses of social life of the periods dealt with make the account informal , without the sacrifice of sufficient technical details to meet the needs of the general reader .

		`` The Haitian Revolution ,
1791	DATE	to 1804 , '' by Mr.
T. G. Steward	PERSON	, is now reissued in a second edition -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Enthusiasm for his subject and a per - sonal knowledge of present-day life on the island help the author in his endeavor , as he suggests in the Introduction , to present `` touches of genius in character , and here and there glimpses of moral grandeur in action . ''

		A list of authorities consulted , a chart of the presidents of
Haiti	LOCATION	with their terms of office , a classified list of Haitian authors with names of their works , and an appendix containing
Thiers	PERSON	's Exposition of the Revolution are useful features of the volume .

		Despite the melancholy interest that must at - tach at this time to a reprint of The Hague con - ventions and declarations of
1899	DATE	and
1907	DATE	, it is well to be reminded that modern civilization was at least capable of formulating such a code , even though it could not maintain it .

		The large volume which Dr.
James Brown Scott	PERSON	has edited for the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace	ORGANIZATION	, and which the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	publishes , con - tains the complete text of these two declarations , with tables of signatures , ratifications and adhe - sions of the various powers , and texts of reserva - tions .

		An exhaustive `` Index-Digest '' to all of this material is a feature of great value .

		A service of no little importance to American students of economics has been performed by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in publishing a new translation of
Gide	PERSON	and
Rist	PERSON	's `` History of Eco - nomic Doctrines , '' made from the second revised and augmented edition of
1913	DATE	under the direc - tion of the late
William Smart	ORGANIZATION	by Dr.
R. Richards	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 559 The work has long been known as probably the best foreign contribution on the subject , indeed , no English writer has yet covered the same ground with equal thoroughness and success .

		Its unique value lies in the fact that it gives us `` something like a true perspective of certain modern theories by connecting them with their , historical antece - dents . ''

		The translator 's work is of excellent qual - ity , and the wealth of detail in the volume is made completely available for reference purposes by a full index .

		The beauty and variety of our
spring	DATE	wild flow - ers fully entitle them to the distinctive treatment which Miss
Harriet L. Keeler	PERSON	has accorded them in her pocket volume , `` Our Early Wild Flowers '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Something like one hundred and thirty plants are described , including all that are habitually in bloom during
March , April	DATE	, and
May	DATE	in the northern states .

		In addition to careful descriptions and general comments , practically every plant dealt with is illustrated , eight in exceptionally good water-color plates by Miss
Eloise P. Luquer	PERSON	, twelve in full-page reproduc - tions from photographs , and the rest in pen-and - ink text drawings .

		The little book should prove an indispensable companion for the nature-lover in his
spring	DATE	rambles .

		On the theory that a little learning is a danger - ous thing , the '' A-B-C books '' projected by Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	should be set down as among the most iconoclastic ventures of the publishing season .

		An examination , however , of those at hand belies the supposition , and we recommend each in its field , both for the simple manner in which facts are presented and for the definite way in which it lures the interested reader to make a practical test of its principles .

		The following volumes have been published : `` A-B-C of Correct Speech , '' by Mrs.
Florence Howe Hall	PERSON	; `` A-B-C of Vegetable Gar - dening , '' by Mr.
Eben E. Rexford	PERSON	; `` A-B-C of Golf , '' by Mr.
John Duncan Dunn	PERSON	; `` A-B-C of Automobile Driving , '' by Mr.
A. Hyatt Verrill	PERSON	; `` A-B-C of Motion Pictures , '' by Mr.
Robert E. Walsh	PERSON	; and `` A-B-C of Cooking , '' by Mrs.
Chris	PERSON	- tine
Terhune Herrick	PERSON	.

		To the already innumerable illustrated editions of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	must now be added a quarto volume privately printed and published by
Messrs. Galloway & Porter	ORGANIZATION	, of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, the particular distinction of which is that it is the work of a Persian artist ,
Mera Ben Kavas Sett	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` It is original , '' says the artist , `` as much as a thorough acquaintance of Persian literature and thoughts can render it . ''

		No one is likely to dis - pute this claim of originality , whatever else may be thought of the book .

		Indeed , so exotic and weirdly unconventional is the artist 's work that one is almost at a loss to judge of its artistic qual - ity .

		The treatment is largely symbolic , and there - fore is a welcome relief from the customary pictorial style of Omar illustrators .

		Then , too , the artist has not been afraid to express the spirit of frank sensuousness that is inherent in the quat - rains .

		On these accounts the edition is to be welcomed , and collectors of Omar literature should add it to their shelves .

		The edition is , we believe , limited to 250 copies .

		NOTES AXD A volume of short stories by Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	will soon be issued under the title , `` Fara - way Stories . ''

		`` Science of Mechanics '' by
Ernest Mach	PERSON	is announced for
July	DATE	issue by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Rambles of a Canadian Naturalist , '' by Mr.
S. T. Wood	PERSON	, will soon be brought out by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	has recently completed a new novel which will be published at once .

		`` The Sailor '' is its title .

		A volume of war sketches by Mr.
C. Lewis	PERSON	Hind will be published this month by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	under the title , `` The Soldier Boy . ''

		`` The Path of the Modern Russian Stage , and Other Essays '' is the title of a new volume by
Alexander Bakshy	PERSON	, which is soon to be published .

		The first book announced by the
Britton Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a concern recently organized , is ``
Georgina	PERSON	of the Rainbows '' by Mrs.
Annie Fellows Johnston	PERSON	.

		A study of `` Contemporary Politics in the Far East , '' by Professor
Stanley K. Hornbeck	PERSON	of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, is announced for
June	DATE	publication by Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		The third series of `` Sixty Years in the Wilderness , '' by Sir
Henry Lucy	PERSON	, to which he gives the title `` Nearing Jordan , '' will be published before the end of the present month .

		`` The Sins of the Children , '' Mr.
Cosmo Hamil	PERSON	- ton 's forthcoming novel of American family life and of temptation as it is met to-day , is announced for issue early in the autumn by
Messrs. Little , Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two little books dealing with the broader aspects of the immigration problem , which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish this month , are `` Straight America '' by Miss
Frances A. Kellor	PERSON	, and `` Americanization '' by Mr.
Royal Dixon	PERSON	.

		Early in the autumn Mr.
Robert J. Shores	PERSON	will issue `` United States Army Pioneers , '' a work showing the achievements of
United States	LOCATION	army officers in times of peace ; and `` Under the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	, '' a history of polar exploration in the Antarctic .

		Among other new volumes to be issued at once by Mr.
Nicholas L. Brown	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	are : `` Plays and Sonnets '' by Mr.
Ernest Lacy	PERSON	, in two volumes , containing three plays and sixty odd sonnets ; and `` Ephemera , '' Greek prose poems by Mr.
Mitchell S. Buck	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hutton Webster	PERSON	's `` Rest Days '' is announced for immediate issue by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It out - lines the origin and development of the
Hebrew Sabbath	ORGANIZATION	, presenting a large body of evidence relat - ing to rest days in all parts of the world and inter - preted from an anthropological standpoint .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has just completed a novel entitled `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through , '' wkich will appear as a serial in the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' prior to book publication .

		The story describes
Great Britain	LOCATION	before the war , and shows how the 560 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 8	DATE	conflict has affected the spirit and character of the nation .

		Among other volumes which Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	announce for publication in the autumn are the following : `` The World for Sale , '' by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; `` The Rising Tide , '' by Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	; `` Rainbow 's End , '' by Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	, and `` The Thirteenth Commandment , '' by Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	.

		Lord
Cromer	PERSON	has a third series of `` Political and Literary Essays '' in preparation with
Messrs. Macmillan	PERSON	, dealing for the greater part with mat - ters connected directly or indirectly with the war .

		The literary essays include a review of Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's `` Life of Shakespeare , '' and a paper on Lord
Curzon	PERSON	's `` War Poems . ''

		Some time ago it was announced that the pub - lication of the second volume of
Maxim Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's autobiography would be indefinitely postponed , owing to the fact that the English translation and printed sheets of the book were interned in
Berlin	LOCATION	for the duration of the war .

		But word has now been received that the work is running serially in a Russian magazine , and a fresh translation may be undertaken immediately .

		It will be called `` In the World , '' and , like the first instalment , `` My Childhood , '' will be published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.
