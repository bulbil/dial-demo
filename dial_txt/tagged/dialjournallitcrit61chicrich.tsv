		Sitting here in my secluded Florentine garden , I dream how good it would have been to know
George Gissing	PERSON	.

		One might have helped him with sympathy , if in no other way .

		For his path led up where he left blood from his feet and hands upon the stones .

		The one flowery by-path into which he once diverged probably crossed my own path .

		Aloof from the thousands of tourists with their `` professional '' outfit , from whom the real lover of the ideal
Italy	LOCATION	would fain avert his face , there walked here in my time this high-souled pilgrim .

		One could forgive many an ill turn of Fortune had she in her turning but brought one to sight and speech of him .

		What a sense of inward distinction it would have inspired to hav been the man who once saw Gissing plain !

		It was here , some years after his too early death , that he first became something more -LRB- and how much more ! -RRB-

		than a name to me , through his travel-book entitled `` By the Ionian Sea : Notes of a Ramble in
Southern Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		It is the story of the author 's long - yearned-for holiday , which he employed in seeking through
JVIagna Graecia	LOCATION	for the vestiges of its vanished cities , places ill-starred in history and unstarred in
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		It is not a book which is recommended to the tourist .

		Among the scores of officious guides and travel-books , most of them manufactured for the trade , which in normal years are conspicu - ous in the show-windows of the bookshops on
Via Tornabuoni	LOCATION	, it is not to be found .

		Per - haps there is not a copy for sale this side
London	LOCATION	.

		It is a book for the adventurous traveller in that
Italy	LOCATION	which is visible only to the eye of informed imagination .

		There lies , for example ,
Crotona	LOCATION	, that marvellous centre of wealth and beauty and urbane cul - ture , which sent Milo to the Olympian Games and could afford Pythagoras three hundred disciples .

		There is no visible trace of it left .

		What
Gissing	PERSON	saw with the outward eye is a wretched little village called
Cotrone	PERSON	-LRB- not
Crotona	LOCATION	-RRB- with a squalid inn , where he paid dear for the gratification of his historic senti - THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	merit Smitten down with sudden fever , he lay in this filthy inn for days and nights , half delirious , without proper food or attendance .

		Apparently his journey and his life had well nigh ended together .

		But here he had a dream for the sake of which , he says , he was glad of the experience .

		The description of that dream seems to me to transcend in splendor anything in the `` Opium Eater , '' showing a side of
Gissing	PERSON	's literary power which , so far as I know , he has displayed nowhere else .

		The impressions left by the book are clear and bright among a thousand faded ones left by more recent reading .

		Of the many charming books about
Italy	LOCATION	that I have read , this , after
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Italian Journey , '' blossoms most fragrant in memory ; though almost equally memorable is the fine study of Italian nature by
Victor Heyn	PERSON	-LRB- another German -RRB- .

		But the booksellers are quite right in not keeping
Gissing	PERSON	's book in stock : there is little in it for persons in search of information ; and it would probably disappoint readers of such a solid book as Story 's `` Roba di Roma '' and the less substantial but dainty travel sketches of
Howells	LOCATION	and
James	PERSON	.

		Indeed the author has , quite unobtrusively and unconsciously , put more into it about
Gissing	PERSON	than about
Italy	LOCATION	.

		And in this , probably , consisted the spell which it laid upon me : giving me to know one of those rare exotic natures that sometimes alight , like visitors from a happier planet , upon the fat lowlands of
England	LOCATION	, soon to be withered by that rigorous social climate .

		For it was a character of rare distinction whom I met thus unexpectedly by the
Ionian Sea	LOCATION	.

		There was other treasure-trove possibly even rarer in these days , a piece of sound litera - ture .

		Gissing 's pure well-bred , nobly simple style is his own , it is himself .

		It is a sincere old wine innocent of effervescent ingredients , limpid to the eye , fragrant to taste , clearing the brain of vapors , exhilarant yet sobering .

		For such a style , devoid of mannerism , stoop - ing to no cheap devices of slang or dialect or `` punch , '' one must travel a long way back upon the rather grass-grown path leading to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's well of English undefiled .

		At that fount , which the old Bible translators turned into a
spring	DATE	of
Bethesda	LOCATION	,
Gissing	PERSON	drank freely from a cup which seems to have been handed to him by Swift .

		When in the course of time it became my privilege to read `` The Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	, '' I felt the rapture of first love give place to the steady joy of old friend - ship .

		It would have been the same , I suppose , if I had read this book first .

		-LRB- The reader will pardon me : not pretending to sit in the seat of the critic on this occasion , I am only trying to relate my personal adventures in the read - ing of
Gissing	PERSON	; the use of the pronoun of the first person is really , therefore , prompted rather by modesty than by egotism . -RRB-

		I do not know how to compare first love and friend - ship ; certainly in the commerce of books no subsequent joy can come up to `` the first fine careless rapture . ''

		True , memory is an en - chanter ; the old books bear compound interest upon all the delight , and all the pain too , with which we have read them in times gone by .

		But the pleasures of memory have a sober cast .

		With what a leap of the heart did we first read the `` Faust '' of Goethe with as clear an understanding as if it had been written in the language of
Marlowe	LOCATION	; or stand face to face with the spirit of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	or of
Leo	PERSON	- pardi .

		Matthew Arnold tells us how he had felt this rapture over the pages of the `` Cen - taur '' of
Maurice de Guerin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , indeed , the analogy of first love holds good : there is always the bystander who rails , `` I ca n't imagine what he sees in her ! ''

		I trust the reader will not rail , but I can not blame him if he fails to see what I see in
Gissing	LOCATION	.

		Blame !

		How can taste for what is wholesome be kept intact when a thousand literary craters are showering down their flakes of creosote that sift in through every crevice , coat the palate , and scant the breath of life ?

		The only rem - edy would be , if we can not keep out of its way , to adopt a mask as soldiers do against the German choke-gas .

		It would be pleasant , to the writer at least , to dwell awhile here upon the Ryecroft Papers ; but I suppose they must be very familiar to DIAL readers .

		Possibly the novels are equally familiar ; at all events , since one must choose , I choose to devote my space chiefly to some consideration of them .

		For a cursory survey of
Gissing	PERSON	's literary output his competent and friendly critic , Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	, in his introduction to `` The House of Cobwebs , '' takes nearly fifty pages .

		This is far too little :
George Gissing	PERSON	should have a niche in the Pantheon of `` English Men of Letters , '' and Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	should be the sculptor of the noble image .

		I take as a text ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL or pretext , for the little that can be said here the story called `` The Odd Women , '' partly because I am now re-reading it with increasing admiration , partly because Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	takes occasion to fling a hasty stone at it .

		In an ill-considered foot-note , he stigmatizes this novel as `` a rather sordid and depressing sur - vey of the life-histories of certain orphaned daughters of a typical Gissing doctor . ''

		This reminds one of
Besant	PERSON	's anecdote of the man from
Auckland	LOCATION	who landed at `` Wapping , spent six weeks rambling aimlessly about
East London	LOCATION	, never venturing westward beyond j the tower , and carried home the report that
London	LOCATION	, ' though immense , is architecturally very inferior to
Auckland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	appears to have seen only the Whitechapel dis - trict of the novel in question .

		It would be as true to describe `` The Tempest '' as a sordid tale about a savage monster and a parcel of drunken sailors .

		I have cited the least violent part of Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	's calumnious descrip - tion , which is calculated to warn readers of wholesome taste away from the book .

		One would have thought that only a newspaper critic could venture to base a verdict so severe upon the title and the first two chapters .

		The truth is , of course , that even as to plot , which , though ingenious , affords by no means a chief reason for admiration of this novel , these sordid `` life-histories '' are distinctly subordinate .

		The main plot and , what is more to the purpose , the main interest , are con - cerned with the pursuit by a strong and resolute man of an equally resolute woman who had devoted herself heart and soul to the uplifting of unfortunate sisters , and specific - ally to a school designed to train to self-help - fulness as many as possible of the `` odd .

		women , '' the discards of the matrimonial market .

		These two capital figures , lovingly portrayed at full length and with minute detail by the sure hand of a master , are set in brilliant relief upon that obscure back - ground whereon it would be morbid to fix one 's gaze .

		In contrast with this really bright and charming story , there emerges from the background pretty
Monica	PERSON	, who is cast away upon the desert island of marriage with a species of lower-middle-class Othello , a fero - ciously conscientious chap with primitive views about the subjection of woman .

		Then there is the engaging episode , which has all the requisites of a good `` short story , '' of the marriage of Micklethwaite after an en - gagement of seventeen years .

		That it is what Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	calls `` a jack-in-the-box plot '' matters little ; comparatively few long English novels can boast of the exemplary unity of `` The Egoist '' or `` The Return of the Native . ''

		What greatly matters is that there is nothing puppet-like about the personages who live and move and have their being upon these fas - cinating pages , pages over some of which one lingers long and of which it would be difficult to skip any , except perhaps the some - what perfunctory final chapter .

		Philosophi - cally , the novel treats of the `` woman ques - tion , '' whereof it contains discussions more material and penetrating than some regular treatises .

		The natural and abundant dia - logue , wise , witty , on occasion trivial , but never insignificant , is full of good things .

		The merely descriptive passages are models of terse and graphic handling such as is rarer in English than in French fiction .

		Portrayal of character is in solution in the dialogue ; the author refrains from advising you what you ought to think of his creatures , though he does sometimes pause to describe their thoughts , instead of compelling the reader to infer them .

		Notably , there is little indulgence in verbal landscape-painting , that ingenious modern device for filling up the time -LRB- and the page -RRB- while awaiting some delayed train of thought .

		I believe this book contains not a single touch of what is called `` description of nature '' before the twenty-fifth chapter , where the lovers are alone together by flood and fell ; and even here , though delightful glimpses of scenery are scattered through the narrative , there is no formal landscape-piece .

		A lecture , generally one of a course , while the vessel is failing to get under way or lying becalmed in the doldrums , is an accepted fea - ture of English fiction as practised by the masters , Fielding ,
Scott	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Thack	PERSON	- eray ,
Meredith	PERSON	, even
Dickens	PERSON	, and from these high regions down to a nadir in Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	-LRB- `` The Oakleyites '' -RRB- .

		How often does the long-suffering reader cry out to the novel - ist , as did Hamlet to the player , `` Begin , mur - derer , pox , leave thy damnable faces and begin ! ''

		In using just now the term `` nadir '' I meant to imply that I was speaking of stars , and that the writer mentioned is a member of the same system , at whatever astronomic distance .

		There is an imperfectly defined but distinct THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	zone along which literature leaves off above and beneath which flourish journalism , adver - | tisement-writing , all multitudinous forms of penmanship .

		When it chances that one of the million penmen , emerging , shoots up through this zone , there is joy in
Heaven	LOCATION	.

		That tran - sit must have been made by
George Gissing	PERSON	at an early age .

		Born in
1857	DATE	, he published his first novel , `` Workers in the Dawn , '' as early as
1880	DATE	.

		Between this date and
1903	DATE	, when he died , the amount of his production , consid - ering its quality and the unfavoring circum - stances , is amazing .

		The list contains twenty - two novels , two volumes of short stories , an abridgment of
Forster	PERSON	's life of
Dickens	LOCATION	, a critical study of
Dickens	LOCATION	, besides the two re - markable books of which I spoke at the outset .

		The adequate study of his life and work which is yet to seek will perhaps determine at what moment of his career
Gissing	PERSON	crossed the dubious zone of twilight and emerged a star shining with its own internal light .

		At risk of being thought whimsical , I sug - gest -LRB- by way of bringing this causerie to a close -RRB- that
George Gissing	PERSON	as an artist is own brother to
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		They are alike in minute accuracy of observation , in perfection of fabric , in sureness of touch , in the well - bred simplicity which is the last refinement of art .

		By no means do I resent the implication that
Gissing	PERSON	has a certain feminine quality , but this , mind you , is by no means equivalent to the denial of his virility as an artist .

		Con - trast his women , for example , with
Meredith	PERSON	's bright creations ,
Clara Middleton	PERSON	,
Lucy Feverel	PERSON	,
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	,
Diana	PERSON	of the Cross - ways , all colored with the flaming tints of masculine passion .

		We see them all through the eyes of their first lover , who is the author of their being .

		Gissing appears , on the other hand , to be no more in love with his
Rhoda Nunn	PERSON	than is Miss
Austen	PERSON	with her
Elizabeth Bennet	PERSON	.

		These two kindred artists portray their women with feminine detachment , with a sympathy excluding sexual passion .

		Which attitude , that of Meredith -LRB- which seems also to be Shakspere 's -RRB- , or that of Miss
Austen	PERSON	and
Gissing	PERSON	, conduces to the truest vision , is an sesthetic question concerning which experts are , as usual , divided .

		Is it a masculine or a feminine note that
Gissing	PERSON	's men are apt to be more convincingly portrayed than are Miss
Austen	PERSON	's ?

		But I wish not to insist upon the parallel , because it is difficult to imagine what
Jane Austen	PERSON	would turn out to be with all the difference of the century , haunted with social problems , heart-heavy with the wretchedness of the hopeless human scene , exiled from her fair country-side , lodged solitary in a
London	LOCATION	garret or cellar , ill-clad and ill-fed , cut off from cheerful intercourse , writing for her bread and seasoning it with her tears .

		Diffi - cult to imagine , and , the sensitive reader will exclaim , horrible !

		Yet is the fact before us scarcely less sad and strange .

		That a man of so fine a temper was able in such conditions to pursue his existence is remarkable enough .

		That , harassed and depressed by circum - stances of peculiar misery such as have driven others to suicide , he should have been able to gain and hold an outlook so wide and serene , to delineate so large a section of human life at once voraciously and , on the whole , enter - tainingly , is past comprehending .

		We can only put the marvel a little farther away , murmuring the catch-phrase , `` miracle of genius . ''

		How he managed to induce soul and body to dwell together in amity throughout those sullen years of toil , what hopes buoyed him up , what illusions he clung to , one can guess from a thousand details in his novels .

		The masterpiece entitled `` New Grub Street '' is an instructive example of the way in which a man of genius can `` convert his gyves to graces . ''

		It is a vast series of Hogarthian cartoons of the human scene wherein he was both actor and spectator .

		The dramatis per - soncB of this darkened stage , the
Milvains	PERSON	and the Yules ,
Reardon	PERSON	,
Biffin	LOCATION	,
Hinks	LOCATION	,
Whelpdale	LOCATION	, are more or less involved in the tragic fate that overshadowed him .

		They are no mere creations of fancy : they clank the chain that shackled him , their living flesh is seared with the same branding-iron .

		To those who look to fiction for cheer , for a kind of opiate for the memory , perhaps for brief respite from intolerable conditions , I hesitate to recommend the novels of
George Gissing	PERSON	.

		Some may indeed find here what - ever consolation there may be in the reminder that `` we are not all alone unhappy . ''

		It is hard to conceive that anyone can be the worse for commerce with an author whose observa - tion is so intelligent and whose art is so re - fined .

		That these novels are not examples of flawless art is probably the fault of the public to which perforce he catered .

		Speaking for myself , these books are chiefly dear and affect - ing because of the traces of his own nature ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL because my hand touches sometimes the scars of his own wounds .

		As we follow these traces of him , the author sooner or later reveals himself as a friend .

		Short was his life and full of labor and j sorrow ; pity he could not have been spared | to see the good years wherein he might have enjoyed some fruition of his painful sowing !

		Yet his art bears silent and eloquent testimony , to the many , many hours of deep enjoyment that must have been his .

		Despite the tragedy that clouded his life and that overglooms his works , we can not , on the whole , call other than happy the fate of one who had the grace to translate the stubbornness of Fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style .

		The first meetings were held in his rooms , and for many years he was its
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary .

		He might almost be called the Memory of the Society : the drawers of his mind are full of information about long forgotten debates and dead pioneers .

		It is natural that a great many of his chapters have rather a domestic interest ; few except Fabians them - selves can be expected to take a feverish inter - est in the rejected programmes of rebel bodies within the Society , and the genesis of propagandist tracts which are now on the shelf .

		But anyone who reads the book , keeping his eye all the time on the contemporary political history of
England	LOCATION	, will find it very enlightening , for it is the history of the mod - ern social reform movement in parvo .

		It is also stimulative , for it shows how much can be done , even in a large modern State , by a small group of intelligent and determined persons unassisted by wealth or social prestige .

		In the early eighties ,
Pease	PERSON	was a young member of the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	,
Webb	PERSON	and
Sydney	LOCATION	Oliver were
Colonial Office	ORGANIZATION	clerks , and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	an immigrant Irish journalist whose books were still in his brain and who was learning to speak at street corners and at suburban '' Parliaments . ''

		Those men , with Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	,
Graham Wallas	PERSON	,
Hubert Bland	PERSON	, and -LRB- for a time -RRB-
Annie Besant	PERSON	, have done almost all the important work of the Society .

		It had a good deal to do with the formation of
the Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	, and with the conversion of the Liberals from laissez faire individual - ism ; it has shaped important Acts of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment ; it has infected large sections of the English intelligentzia with Socialism ; and it has had a good deal to do with the wholesale incursion of artists and litterateurs into polit - ical controversy which is so marked a phe - nomenon to-day .

		Whether it is a good thing for the artist 's art that he should be harnessed to the chariot of social reform is an open question .

		But it is a fact that in our time he usually is .

		It is n't an altogether new thing , of course :
Dickens	PERSON	, for instance , had something to say about private lunatic asylums and private schools , and
William Godwin	PERSON	wrote ``
Caleb Williams	PERSON	'' merely in order to expose the defects of landlordism and the penal system .

		But in the twentieth century it is almost uni - versal ; and the
Fabian Society	ORGANIZATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	in particular , has to a considerable extent been instrumental in the change ; though we may deduce from the experience of other countries that it would have happened somehow in any case .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , conspicuous throughout Mr.
Pease	PERSON	's book .

		He was not .

		in the Society at the start , but came in soon after , characteristically getting himself elected to the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	at once and proceeding on the spot to show his brethren how to draw up pamphlets which would hit the public in the eye .

		Some of the later chapters are dominated by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, who , about ten years ago , came charging into the Society , trumpeting like an excited elephant , and demanding that the Fabians , amongst other things , should become a political party .

		There was a brief Civil War , and in the end Mr.
Wells	PERSON	was beaten and seceded .

		Where he failed nobody else could succeed ; the waves of revolt beat in vain against the Old Gang ; Us y sont , Us y restent .


Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's new `` Androcles '' book , with a preface on the Christian religion and its Founder , will presumably have appeared on your side already .

		At the moment Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is engaged in a controversy with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		With a new book as his text , he analyzed at great length in `` The New Statesman '' the flaws in
Chesterton	LOCATION	's intel - lect .

		It was to be expected that
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	in reply would point out several large beams in his critic 's eye ; and in `` The New Witness '' he argues that the whole of `
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's political 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	career has been spent in vain , that Collectivist propaganda has only brought the
Servile State	ORGANIZATION	upon us , and that the only way out is the
Distributive State	ORGANIZATION	of that eminent peasant - proprietor , Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	.

		Incidentally , the weekly articles that
G. K. C.	PERSON	is writing for `` The New Witness '' under the title , `` At the Sign of the World 's End '' -LRB- which is a public house in
Chelsea	LOCATION	-RRB- , are the best journal - ism he has ever done .

		The journal , a weekly edited by
G. K.	PERSON	's brother ,
Cecil	PERSON	, is the suc - cessor of `` The Eye Witness , '' which was founded by
Belloc	ORGANIZATION	to attack party politicians .

		It has been very good lately .


Cecil Chesterton	PERSON	has collected together a staff of men none of whom fit into the ordinary political grooves but all of whom write exceedingly well .

		Their views I wo n't discuss ; but their invective is at once violent and polished , and commands admiration even when it is directed against one 's own friends .


G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	has not , I think , published a new work during the
last month	DATE	; but he has several on the way , includ - ing a `` History of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		At a venture one may anticipate that he will be right where the conventional historians are wrong , and wrong where they are right .

		Mrs.
Mary Agnes Hamilton	PERSON	's `` Dead Yes - terday '' is the new novel which is being most discussed .

		It attempts an historical social sur - vey of the years immediately preceding the war .

		The author is on the staff of `` The Economist , '' a queer place for a novelist to be in any age but this .

		There has been no good new poetry ; the nearest thing to it is
Charles Doughty	PERSON	's `` The Titans . ''

		Mr.
Doughty	PERSON	is an extraordinary old man .

		A generation ago he wrote a very great thing `` Wanderings in Arabia Deserta . ''

		It is one of the finest travel books in the language ; it has what is so often falsely attributed to second rate books the true epic quality ; and , though it has never had the fame it deserves , the intensity with which some peo - ple appreciate it is shown by the prodigious price one has to pay -LRB- if one can get a copy at all -RRB- for a copy of the original edition .

		In the last ten years Mr.
Doughty	PERSON	has taken to writ - ing immensely long poems , the best of which are `` The Dawn in
Britain	LOCATION	'' and `` Adam Cast Forth . ''

		They are remarkable on the one hand for their occasional superb beauties , and on the other for their unique obscurity .

		Mr.
Doughty	PERSON	affects the most outlandish construc - tions , compressions , and words .

		He some - times writes like an ancient Angle ,
Saxon	LOCATION	, or Jute who has awoke from a long trance and spent six months learning the modern tongue in an English agricultural household where
Milton	PERSON	and the
Bible	LOCATION	are on the shelves .

		This beginning of book two is typical : Among the infinite stars of firmament : Hath many sythes ; sith GOD 'S HAND launcht it forth ; Bowed down slow-reeling axe-tree of
Earth	LOCATION	clot .

		Before the THRONE !

		Each Keverence , star - priests tell us , As thirty thousand Suns revolving years , Endures .

		There is no pose about it ; it is as natural to him as to them was the uncouthness of his rock-born Titans .

		The theme of the new book is a characteristically tremendous one : the birth of the world from Chaos , the play of the elements and the growth of vegetation before man was , the wars of the Titans and the Gods , the wanderings and inventions of our earliest ancestors .

		There are some beautiful passages : one especially describing
spring	DATE	in the young world before the creation of the human race .

		But such passages are few ; and large tracts of the poem -LRB- though the poet 's mind is always labouring -RRB- are as arid to the traveller as the desert in which the first tribe nearly perished of thirst .

		I would not warn anyone against `` The Titans '' ; it is the work of a man who is almost a great poet .

		But it would be unwise of anyone who does not know
Doughty	ORGANIZATION	's works to begin with this one .

		Three plays by `` Georgian '' poets
Gordon Bottomley	PERSON	's `` King
Lear	PERSON	's Wife , ''
Eupert Brooke	PERSON	's ``
Lithuania	LOCATION	, '' and
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	's `` Hoops '' were produced at a special matinee recently .

		They had a very moderate success .

		Brooke 's play was unrevised ;
Bottomley	PERSON	's is unconvincing , it piles up ineffective grue - somenesses , and its best poetical parts are pre - cisely those which go least well on the stage .

		Other events are the death in
Italy	LOCATION	of
H. P. Home	PERSON	, and the appearance of the first number of `` Form . ''

		Home was the author of the standard work on
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, and one of the leaders of the typographical revival .

		Types designed by him are used by the
Florence	LOCATION	and
Kiccardi Presses	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Form , '' which appears somewhat later than was intended , has an unusually large page , which lends itself to experiments in design .

		The text consists mainly of poems ; there are eight by
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and others by
Sturge Moore	PERSON	,
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, W. de la Mare ,
Francis Burrows	PERSON	, and
Laurence Housman	PERSON	, many of them repro - duced from copies written out by hand .

		Other contributors are
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	-LRB- a double-page wood cut -RRB- ,
Charles Shannon	PERSON	,
Charles Ricketts	PERSON	, and
Austin Spare	ORGANIZATION	, the editor .


London	LOCATION	,
June 8 , 1916	DATE	.

		J ' ; ' bQU -RSB-
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL CASUAL COMMENT .

		GETTING OUT OF THE EDUCATIONAL TREADMILL is something that the live educator and the live stu - dent have to do repeatedly ; for any prescribed course of study tends to become sooner or later a treadmill , just as all forms of devotion tend toward a soulless ritualism , and all manners and customs toward meaningless convention .


Ainherst College	ORGANIZATION	, which has always thrown the weight of its influence on the side of the retention of the humanities in liberal culture , now again commands approval by its effort to make its courses of study more than ever a quickening of the spirit by relieving them of deadening formality .

		Next year fifteen special senior courses are to be offered , with emphasis upon individual research and upon the correlation of all studies as something more than so many scraps of unrelated learning .

		The seminar method will be largely used , each of these conclaves limiting itself to not more than ten members , and sometimes having two or more pro- fessors present , not necessarily representing the same department .

		.

		Among the new courses thus offered is one by President
Meiklejohn	PERSON	and Pro- fessor Toll on contemporary problems of philoso - phy .

		Two professors , one in the English department and one in history , will give a course on ideas of political and religious freedom in English history and literature .

		The department of economics offers a course on social control of industrial activity .

		Other new courses are on significant motives and tendencies in literature , particularly in modern poetry ; on early German drama ; and on the devel - opment of political theory .

		All these courses , with their wide opportunity for original investigation and for free and many-sided discussion , represent a far remove from the old daj ^ s when , too often , a ten-minute scramble through half a dozen pages of the textbook constituted many a happy-go - lucky student 's sole preparation for the ordeal of the classroom .

		PROBLEMS IK PUNCTUATION have a fascination for certain minds belonging to what , for con - venience , may be called the logic-chopping order .

		A strictly logical system of punctuation is a desid - eratum ; but the shades of relationship between words and clauses are so various as to make such a system impossible without the use of an incon - venient number of punctuation marks .

		Even with the comparatively few marks now recognized there is a tendency to limit oneself to the comma , the period , and the dash ; the last-named serving all uses not served by the other two , and frequently usurping the functions of the other two .

		Until recently there has been but one standard work on English punctuation , the treatise by
John Wilson	PERSON	, the printer , which was first published at Man - chester ,
England	LOCATION	, in
1844	DATE	, was republished in
Boston	LOCATION
six years later	DATE	, and had gone through seventeen editions as early as
1868	DATE	.

		A much later hand-book , originally of anonymous authorship , has now appeared in revised and enlarged form as the work by Mr.
William Livingston Klein	PERSON	.

		`` Why We Punctuate '' -LRB- issued by the Lancet Pub - lishing Co. of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	-RRB- is sub-titled , `` Reason versus Rule in the Use of Marks , '' though it does not antagonize the commonly accepted punctuation , but rather bases it on a fundament of reason .

		Of course careless and faulty punctuators are called to account , as would be expected in any treatise of the sort .

		Certain current usages of doubtful correctness might well have received a degree of attention that has not been given them by this writer .

		For instance , an undiscriminating use of .

		the comma is familiar in sentences of the following type : Her costume was old-fashioned , grotesque , , unbecoming , in short , positively hideous .

		The com - mas before and after `` in short '' would imply a likeness of relation between that phrase and the words immediately before and those immediately after it , whereas the connection with what follows is much closer than that with what precedes .

		Yet few writers would take the little trouble necessaiy to make this clear to the eye .

		The same error is often committed in introducing such a word as `` namely '' into the body of a sentence .

		Another prevalent violation of both rule and reason in punctuation is seen in the excessive use of the full stop where there is nothing approaching a com - plete sentence to require it .

		This illogical and irritating practice should be condemned .

		As a plea for right reason , however , and careful discrimina - tion in the use of punctuation marks , Mr.
Klein	PERSON	's book is heartily to be commended .

		For clearness and conciseness it is distinctly superior to
Wilson	PERSON	's `` masterful work , '' as that writer 's suc - cessor ungrudgingly calls the `` Treatise on English Punctuation , '' to which he erroneously assigns the year
1826	DATE	as the date of its first appearance .

		HUMOROUS SELF-PORTRAITURE is a favorite form of literary expression with more than one author of genius .

Stevenson	PERSON	had a way of poking fun at himself in his more intimate correspondence and in the privacy of his diary .

		Here is a passage that catches the eye in a trade catalogue of Stevensoniana offered for sale by
C. Gerhardt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is a bit of auto - biography from a manuscript notebook of about sixteen pages , priced at
$ 165.00	MONEY	.

		This chequers his career and makes the mildest travel adventures .

		THE COLLEGE FACULTY AND THE COLLEGE TRUS - TEES have in the past been rather notoriously given to clashing , the one body with the other , each jealous of its rights and privileges , and not always guiltless of usurping powers not belonging to it .

		At this commencement season when plans for the approaching academic year are taking form , there are signs of a salutary strengthening of the powers of those who more immediately control the des - tinies of the college or university .

		Arbitrary action on the part of trustees has ever aroused resentment in the professors , and a less autocratic method of administration has been desired .

		Not long ago there was given in these columns an out - line of a proposed constitution for
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, in which provision was made for faculty participation in the deliberations of trus - tees , and in general for an increased measure of influence and authority on the part of the faculty in university management .

		And now there comes from
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	report of a reorganization whereby three members of the faculty , chosen by the faculty , are to take part in the councils of the governing board , though without power to vote ; and , not less important , any proposed discharge of a member of the teaching body is to be sub - mitted to a committee of the faculty , as also , so far as practicable , any proposed addition to that body .

		Here , too , the power conferred is only advisory , but it is in the direction of that reform lately urged by the
American Association of Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Professors in its deliberations on the best means of safeguarding the college or univer - sity teacher in his tenure of office .

		Cornell and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	have also taken recent action similar in character to that of
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	.

		Not without its bearing upon all this , one now perceives , has been the recent widely-reported case of Professor
Scott Nearing	PERSON	, as also that of Professor
Willard C. Fisher	PERSON	.

		DANTE 'S DEEPER MEANINGS are obscured to many readers not only by his own vivid word-pictures but also by the efforts of the artist to convey those pictures in a medium appealing directly to the eye of sense .

		Dore 's illustrations are wonderful in their delineation of the awful , their power to evoke shudders ; but the careless reader of to-day closes the book with little perception of the spiritual truths thus symbolically interpreted from the poet 's pages .

		As the late
Charles Joseph Little	PERSON	says in a recent volume of essays noticed on another page , `` Dante has suffered much from illus - tration .

		What most readers know is not the poem , but the pictures between the leaves .

		They forget that to the poet hell was allegory and truth the reality .

		His pictures were a transient vision , but the justice of God was an eternal fact ... Because his vivid vision lends itself so readily to the artist 's pencil we sometimes forget , if we ever knew it , that the power of him lies not so much in what he depicts , wonderful as that is , as in that which he suggests . ''

		Milton 's words , `` Whither I go is Hell , myself am Hell , '' are quoted by the writer , who might have added
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's brief summing-up of the whole matter , `` I myself am Heaven and Hell . ''

		A certain wise parent once said to his little boy who was crying at being left alone in the dark : `` My son , there is nobody there to frighten you but yourself ; and in all your life you will never meet with anyone or anything to cause you fear but that same self of yours . ''

		THE EFFECT OF ITERATION , whether for good or ill , was well understood by Falstaff when he exclaimed to Prince Henry : `` 0 , thou hast dam - nable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint .

		Thou hast done much harm upon me Hal ; God forgive thee for it ! ''

		Not pausing here to enjoy the humor of this speech , we pass to another and very different example of iteration .

		The Grand Rapids Public Library `` Bulletin '' prints and reprints sundry pieces of good advice to its readers , urging them , among other things , to ask for what they do n't see , to take books on their
summer	DATE	vacation , to keep on learning , etc. .

		Here is a good and characteristic paragraph headed `` Tell Your Neighbor '' : `` The Library goes into more homes of Grand Rapids than any other muni - cipal department , except the city water works ; and of all other institutions only the gas company and one newspaper surpass it in the number of homes entered .

		It wants to go into every home .

		As a user of the Library tell your neighbor who is not using it how he can do so to his advantage .

		It is a neighborly act to tell your neighbor of something that is worth while ; or better still bring him to the Library and help him get acquainted . ''

		No artful advertiser better knows the value of keeping everlastingly at it in iteration and reiter - ation than does
Librarian Ranck of Grand Rapids	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE SLACKENED STREAM OF ENGLISH NOVELS serves to remind the novel-reader , incidentally , that English energies are in these days largely turned in other directions than imaginative litera - ture , or literature of any sort .

		The
London	LOCATION	liter - ary correspondent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript '' touches upon this point in a recent reference to present-day novel-writers of
England	LOCATION	.

		`` It was always a grievance of theirs , '' he says , `` in the pre - war era , that the enormous over-production in the publishing trade had , of late , made the novel almost as ephemeral as the monthly magazine .

		In three months its sales were over and its life ended , for then the avalanche of a new season descended and snowed it under .

		Now that they limit their issue , the publishers are not in such a hurry to kill them off and make way for a swarm of suc - cessors ; and if novels live longer their authors get more from them in the way of royalties , and so are not under the necessity of writing so many .

		It
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 certainly is a heart-breaking business for a man to spend the better part of a year in building up a book that the critics and the public have all done with in a month or two . ''

		Some novels , not always the very best , escape this fate of speedy oblivion ; perhaps now , under changed conditions , more will escape it and , among the reigning favorites in the realm of romance , an
Amurath	ORGANIZATION	will less speedily succeed an Amurath .

		BOOKS THUMBED BY
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	, some of them very much thumbed , are among the choicest pos - sessions of the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	, famous reposi - tory of literary treasures and in celebrity second only to the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Library -LRB-
Franklin	ORGANIZATION	's library -RRB- among the subscription libraries of
America	LOCATION	.

		A small bookcase , four feet by five , or some such modest dimensions , shut off from the profane and the idly curious by being enclosed in the sacred precincts of the trustees ' room , contains a few dozen works supposed to have been most frequently read or consulted by the father of our country .

		Dumpy little volumes on the military science of that time stand side by side with equally primitive treatises on agriculture , works on poli - tics ,
Arthur Young	PERSON	's travels ,
James Rumsey	PERSON	's `` Plea for the Power of Steam '' -LRB- 1788 -RRB- , and a considerable collection of pamphlets the favorite form of publication adopted by the ambitious author burning with zeal to convert to his views as many as possible of his erring fellow-mortals .

		Visitors to 5ft .

		Vernon who inspect with lively interest the array of old authors there on view are in only occasional instances aware that some of the most read and most prized volumes of that library have long been sheltered beneath a roof hundreds of miles distant from the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		CARD-CATALOGUING AN ARMY of the size with which we are now , after a gasp of amazement , becoming familiar must be such a task as only the imperative necessities of war could have induced any nation to undertake .

		Mention has already been made here of the vast German catalogue of war prisoners in Teutonic custody .

		More stupendous still is the system whereby the soldiers of
France	LOCATION	are , each and all , followed as far as possible in the uncer - tain destinies that overtake them .

		A large hall in the municipal building of
Lyons	PERSON	is given over to card-catalogue uses , and a special department called the '' Bureau de Recherches des Militaires Disparus '' has been created to operate this immense and difficult system for tracing the fate of any missing soldier at any time .

		By means of this device , borrowed , or appropriated , from the library profession , the eager inquiries of anxious friends and relatives concerning those who have disap - peared in the whirlpool of armed strife have , in more than one-fifth of these instances , been author - itatively answered .

		The unanswered questions remain pathetically in the majority -LRB- of about four to one -RRB- , but the measure of success attained by the cataloguers is considerable when one bears in mind the tremendous obstacles to success in any such investigation .

		And not merely information , but also substantial relief and timely cheer to the imprisoned have been made possible , as also the rescue of many a victim of reprisal through devices known to those expert in such matters .

		It was a Frenchman who first invented the card-catalogue , and it is fitting that the French should now profit , in however unexpected a manner , from that inven - tion .

		JAPAN 'S BOOK-IMPORTATIONS have suffered some ' derangement from the all-pervading effects of the !

		war .

		The
Japan	LOCATION	`` Times '' reports that whereas formerly one-quarter of these importations came from
Germany	LOCATION	, forty per cent from
England	LOCATION	, twen - ty-three per cent from
America	LOCATION	, and the remainder from
France	LOCATION	and other countries , now the German importations have entirely ceased , with a corres - ponding increase in English , French , and Russian imported literature .

		The languages and literatures of
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are being studied more than before , the
Tokyo School of Foreign Languages	ORGANIZATION	showing this tendency in a marked degree .

		But side by side with the increased reading of great French and Russian and English authors there goes a not unnatural demand for treatises on the making of dye-stuffs and medicines , on commerce and various industries , on war and on economics .

		Also works on
Mongolia	LOCATION	and
Manchuria	LOCATION	are sought - a fact not without significance , perhaps porten - tous significance .

		The thought and temper of the
Far East	LOCATION	, no less than of the rest of the so-called civilized world , are being remarkably if not alarm - | ingly modified by current events .

		A PERIODICAL OBSESSION , in a peculiar sense of the phrase , must have been noted by many a random reader in these days .

		One can hardly take up any one of the leading magazines and reviews without finding a considerable proportion of its space devoted to war articles and to articles that , though not directly concerned with the war , are on subjects more or less closely related to it .

		This `` featuring '' of the great conflict that is rarely i quite absent from our minds is to be expected in the daily press .

		Its partial monopoly of less sensa - tional publications is more remarkable .

		Among the more serious monthly and quarterly current periodicals , a hasty examination of eight five i American and three English reveals the fact that I not far from one-half their contents has to do with !

		the war ; that is , of the ninety-five articles filling | their pages , forty-three are war articles .

		Thirty - : eight are expressly such , five less exclusively I devoted to the subject .

		One English monthly has : eleven war articles out of a total of fourteen , and another has nine out of fourteen .

		Naturally the magazines of the belligerent countries give more space to the dominant theme than do those of neu - tral countries , though our own periodical literature j is strongly enough tinctured with war .

		A query , ; futile and foolish enough , arises as to what im - perishable literature might under less deplorable conditions have filled all those pages now showing only the panoply of war .

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	DECLINE IN THE AMERICAN BOOK-TRADE FOR
1915	DATE	was among the expected results of the war .

		Some of the details of that decline , as set forth by Mr.
Fred E. Woodward	PERSON	in `` The Bookman , '' are sig - nificant .

		Though books by American authors show a much larger numerical decrease than those by foreign authors -LRB- 1,631 and 645 respectively -RRB- , the relative decrease is about the same .

		Yet why should there have been in this country , peaceful and prosperous as it is , any decrease approaching that necessitated by obvious causes in most of
Europe	LOCATION	?

		Law books fell oft ' more than works in any other department , and this may be a sign of the lawlessness of the times .

		Poetry and drama declined from 902 to 741 ; fiction from 1,053 to 919 .

		History , commerce , and domestic economy show gains , for reasons readily conjecturable .

		These same subjects , witli geography , agriculture , and the fine arts , enjoyed an increase in
England	LOCATION	also .

		Totals for the two years exhibit a general decrease in our book-trade from 12,010 in
1914	DATE	to 9,734 in
1915	DATE	.

		If this falling-oif were attributable to a less lamentable cause , it might be matter for felicitation , and one might at least try to believe that what was lost in quantity was gained in quality .

		SUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY SUPPORT , or aid ren - dered to free libraries by individuals or associa - tions to eke out the not too lavish appropriations from the public funds , is always sure to be most heartily appreciated .

		As has already been noted in these columns , such assistance often enables the library to give valuable service outside the ordinary and expected routine .

		It may open the way to fruitful experiment , give scope to the librarian 's initiative and originality , and , though not free from liability to abuse , must on the whole bring far more of gain than of loss to the institu - tion thus relieved of the harassing anxiety as to how both ends are to be made to meet .

		The
Providence Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as its librarian 's cur - rent Report announces , receives every year sub - stantial aid from an association known as the
Children 's Library Helpers	ORGANIZATION	, which in
1915	DATE	contrib - uted more than thirteen hundred dollars to the library 's income .

		The giving of concerts seems to be the favorite and most successful expedient re - sorted to by these volunteer helpers , and mention is made of a single musical entertainment that yielded a net return of
$ 693.13	MONEY	, which was handed over to the library .

		All this activity is in pleasing contrast with the more usual passive acquiescence in such measure of municipal support as the city fathers choose to sanction an acquiescence often enough not without protest , but going no further .

		A PROPOSED BOOK-COLLECTION OF UNUSUAL CHAR - ACTER has aroused considerable interest of late in the library world .

		President
James	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	wishes the new library building planned for that institution to contain , besides the literature bearing more or less directly on the work of the university , a comprehensive collection of books , manuscripts , pictures , and other like matter , illustrating the life and history of those races and nations that have contributed to the building up of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Many peoples and lan - guages will be represented , as , to name some of the more important , the English , Scandinavian , Ger - man , French , Italian , Hungarian , Russian , Finnish , Armenian , Turkish , Bohemian , Polish , Spanish , and Greek .

		If such a collection at first seems to emphasize the hyphenated quality of our conglom - erate population , the very multitude of these alien but rapidly assimilating elements will demonstrate the absurdity and the impossibility of retaining the hyphen .

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has always received a sort of com - mendation from the American reading public , but professional scholars have almost consistently re - ferred to it as an edition of very unequal merits ; and from this uncertainty , and in some degree collision , of judgments , has developed a fairly gen - eral opinion that
Grant White	ORGANIZATION	possessed in com - bination with some actual editorial discrimination a peculiarly unsafe critical temper and a reckless penchant for emendation .

		It is a generally unap - preciated but very significant fact that this rather vaguely defined view of
White	ORGANIZATION	's merits has grown up in connection with some gross errors as to cer - tain fundamental facts concerning his edition of Shakespeare .

		The bearing of these errors upon his reputation as a scholar should therefore , in justice to him , be carefully considered .

		The domain of literary scholarship which ought to be exactly scientific is bibliography ; and yet strangely enough , it is the bibliography of White which has obscured critical judgment of his capaci - ties as an editor and simply because bibliograph - ical records of general repute have , where they have touched White , prolonged and elaborated a series of surprising inaccuracies .

		The initial error in this series is
Henry G. Bohn	PERSON	's entry of
White	ORGANIZATION	's Shakespeare in his re - edition of
Lowndes	LOCATION	's `` Bibliographers ' Manual , '' published in
1860	DATE	.

		Bohn entered
White	ORGANIZATION	's edition as completed in twelve volumes , although only seven volumes had at that time appeared , only four of these in all probability having come out before
Bohn	PERSON	's copy was sent to press .

		It is this false record which is probably the source of the current impression that White issued two distinct editions , one completed in
1860	DATE	, and the other in
1866	DATE	-LRB- when the last volume of the single edition did actually appear -RRB- .

		The error is repeated in the bibliography attached to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's article in the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature , '' and imported from that into the recent `` Facts about Shakespeare . ''

		The latter volume magnifies the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 error by accusing White of `` puzzling openness to conviction in successive changes of opinion . ''

		This accusation may be applied to
White	ORGANIZATION	's retraction of many of the critical judgments in his `` Shakespeare 's Scholar , '' but it has no basis in connection with his edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, since there was at the time but the one edition .

		The earlier volumes were re-issued before the later vol - umes appeared , but they were printed from the original stereotyped plates .

		Bohn is responsible though not solely responsi - : ble , however for the currency of another false record which has done much more to injure White 's distinction as a scholar .

		In a note to the entry just cited he says : `` This edition includes 117 emenda - tions from
J. P. Collier	PERSON	's corrected folio of
1632	DATE	. ''

		This statement , which is much exaggerated , is still ; given life in such important bibliographical records as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's in the `` Cambridge History '' and Mr.
Jaggard	PERSON	's .

		Upon this point White has suffered a real injustice , for the record itself not merely is wrong , but it places
White	ORGANIZATION	's position in .

		the
Collier	PERSON	controversy in a false light .

		What , then , are the facts ?

		To begin with , it is readily seen that
Bohn	PERSON	's j reference to
White	ORGANIZATION	's edition as complete in
1860	DATE	is simply an example of reckless bibliography : ' .

		Bohn evidently had not seen the edition .

		Needless to say , therefore , his memorandum that the edition ' contained 117 emendations from
Collier	PERSON	's
1632	DATE	folio \ was based upon second-hand information .

		The I probable source of this error may be found in `` The Athena?um '' for
July 4 , 1857	DATE	, where , in an announcement of White 's forthcoming edition , it was said : `` It will include at least the 117 emenda - tions which an eminent American critic has de - clared must inevitably be included in the text of every impression of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays hereafter to be published in any quarter of the world . ''

		It may be recalled that it was `` The Athensum '' which stood sponsor for
Collier	PERSON	in his controversies over the
Perkins	PERSON	folio ; and this fact may explain why the notice distorted entirely the actual views of the eminent American critic who was
Grant White	ORGANIZATION	himself with regard to these emendations .

		What White had really said , in one of his early articles upon
Collier	PERSON	's `` Notes and Emendations '' -LRB- `` Putnam 's Monthly , ''
October , 1853	DATE	-RRB- , was that out of the
1303	DATE	emendations which
Collier	PERSON	brought for - ward ,
1054	DATE	were peculiar to the anonymous cor - rector .

		Of these he utterly rejected 818 , and of the remaining 236 he regarded 119 as `` inadmissible , though plausible . ''

		There were 117 left which seemed , as White put it , `` to be admissible cor - rections of passages which need correction .

		We again say ' seem to be , ' for this number must inev - itably be much reduced upon the discussion of the merits of the readings among the best Shakespearian critics , '' and he constantly empha - sized the purely tentative nature of his judgment upon this point .

		In a later article , in `` The North American Review , '' he said : `` Further investigation has discovered to us that many of these 117 seem - ingly acceptable changes are not peculiar to the MS corrector , and also convinced us that only about seventy-five of them have claims to a place in the text . ''

		When , however , the first four volumes -LRB- the comedies -RRB- of White 's edition appeared , in
1857	DATE	, ` The Athenaeum '' reviewer -LRB-
November 13 , 1858	DATE	-RRB- stated that
White	ORGANIZATION	had `` availed himself of emenda - tions in the much-belied folio of
1632	DATE	in considera - bly more than a hundred instances : therefore when Mr.
White	PERSON	's edition is completed , he will have had to make important use of the same source of im - provement in not fewer than three hundred places . ''

		White replied to this serious misstatement in a letter printed in '' ` The Athenaum ''
January 8 , 1859	DATE	, stating that he had used the readings in question in only twenty-eight instances .

		Either he mis - counted , or his letter was misprinted ; for although the first three volumes include only twenty-eight of the emendations under dispute , the four volumes reviewed contain in fact thirty-eight .


Bonn	LOCATION	's entry , however , is evidently based upon the violent misquotation in `` The Athenaeum '' notice and the absurd exaggeration in the review .

		White 's ex - planatory letter did not save him .

		Further light upon
White	ORGANIZATION	's actual attitude in the
Collier	PERSON	controversy will show how guiltless he is of the accusation , or even the implication , of using
Coiner	ORGANIZATION	's emendations without discretion .

		From the beginning of the controversy , White took an impregnable critical position .

		He did not know for only Singer had dared to assert it then that the corrections were counterfeit ; yet he used only one in sixteen of the corrections in
Collier	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		And these , it must be pointed out , he accepted simply and solely upon their merits as emenda - tions .

		As a result he was criticized by bis reviewers -LRB- including
Lowell	PERSON	,
Whipple	PERSON	, and the `` Athena3um '' reviewer -RRB- for the conservatism which induced him to scrutinize the
Perkins	PERSON	f olio so cautiously .

		When , however ,
Madden	PERSON	's and
Maskelyne	ORGANIZATION	's investigations revealed the spurious nature of the
Collier	PERSON	correc - tions , White 's position was undisturbed , for he had always refused to admit their authority , even grant - ing their antiquity which was the matter of dispute .

		The number of Collier emendations in the later volumes of
White	ORGANIZATION	's Shakespeare , which were published after the exposure , was therefore not very much less , proportionately , than in the earlier volumes .

		In all , he used seventy-three textual emendations from this source .

		It is an easy thing to-day to condemn White for using even this number ; The fact remains , how - ever , that he accepted them intelligently , and that in by far the greater part they represent rather obvious improvements , and improvements which create no unwarranted changes in the sense of passages .

		We can judge little of the real merits of these corrections by considering whether or not they have been absorbed in the best editions of the present day ; for it must be clear that when
Collier	PERSON	was discovered to have been a fabricator of evi - dence , even the most scholarly and sane of his emendations lost not merely their importance but their repute .

		These emendations are not only not generally acknowledged to-day , but they practically can not be used ; and the sense of this fact is likely to prejudice our view of
White	ORGANIZATION	's judgment .

		There can be little doubt that the accumulation of faulty records and faulty deductions has had much to do with the slight opinion in which
White	ORGANIZATION	's 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	work is now apparently held , and is still providing a foundation for perennial error .

		An interesting instance of this accretion of error is found in Mr.
Jaggard	PERSON	's `` Bibliography of Shakespeare , '' in which for the first time White is credited with the editing of an eclectic edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	published by
Martin	ORGANIZATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	and Company , of
New York	LOCATION	, in 1854-6 .

		This ascription is unsupported by any evi - dence whatever , and is apparently a variation of
Bonn	LOCATION	's faulty record .

		The edition in question alludes in the preface of the first volume to a `` competent Shakespearian scholar '' who had under - taken the editorial work ; but the fact that this scholar revealed almost no personal reaction to textual problems makes it extremely unlikely that he can be identified with White , for White was at .

		this very time exhibiting in his critical writings a pretty lively interest in the business of emendation .

		As to the general value of
White	ORGANIZATION	's editorial work , the last word has certainly not been said .

		What has been deprecated most generally of late is his willingness to emend ; and it must be admitted that two hundred emendations -LRB- the actual number of White 's own contributions -RRB- is assuredly a large number for any editor to accept responsibility for .

		Yet the question at issue is not one of number , but of critical quality .

		On this point it is possible only to compare opinions .

		Lowell , a very competent judge of scholarship , considered that
White	ORGANIZATION	's edi - tion was `` for substance , scope , and aim , the best hitherto published '' ; and although he found White careless in respect to some of the obvious duties of the editor , and over-venturesome in some of the less developed fields of critical study , he thought that his policy in emendation was actually too conserva - tive .

		Miss
Jane Sherzer	PERSON	, in an illuminating bibliographical study of American editions of Shakespeare -LRB- `` Modern Language Publications , ''
1907	DATE	-RRB- , while admitting the general superiority of this edition to the American editions which pre - ceded it , believes with regard to its text that `` many of the changes are unnecessary , and some of them , to say the least , no improvement ... On the other hand , most of the emendations are made sanely , wild guesses are avoided , and there is an effort , even if not always successful , to be conser - vative , i.e. , to follow , whenever possible , the first folio or the best quartos . ''

		Professor
Trent	PERSON	, who has collaborated in the revision of
White	ORGANIZATION	's edition , thinks his emendations on the whole rational and often brilliant , and regards White as having been exceptionally endowed for the larger requirements of his task .

		The most approved editing of the present day is calculated for the meridian of pure scholarship , and contemporary scholars are ultra-conservative .

		The history of textual scholarship has shown , how - ever , that questions of text are discussed and re-discussed ; so some good scholar of a century hence may yet say as fair a word for
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	as the late
Churton Collins	PERSON	said for the once-abused
Theobald	PERSON	, who turned much non - sense into sense and made many lame lines walk .

		`` SPOON EIVER '' ONCE MOEE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Throughout his letter in your issue of
May 11	DATE	, Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	professes a high respect for the scientist and his work .

		Yet in speaking of `` reflecting life , '' he first declares that `` this much and no more psychology and the social sciences do '' ; and then , a few lines later , `` The poorest drunkard in his ' last delirium ' can do that , '' that is , reflect life .

		Frankly , I find it difficult to ascertain where Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	stands .

		Furthermore , when I came upon the sentence , `` Truly , literature has partially failed when it does not turn all of life , the lights and shadows , the good and the evil , to account , '' I leapt to the rash conclusion that there could be no disagreement between us on the essential point of my last com - munication .

		I read on , and was bewildered by this outburst : `` By all means let us have careful and scientific investigation of the facts of life , but let not the fire-breathing iconoclast throw the dirty stuff in our faces and bid us call it poetry . ''

		The result is that though I am tempted at times on the basis of some things Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	has said to think that we agree on our critical principles , yet on the whole I am driven to believe that there is a fundamental difference .

		That difference I take to lie in the phrase , `` truth of poetry . ''

		Now I for one feel that the truth which has its basis in facts is not only the highest truth but the only truth .

		The idea which is true for science is true also for art .

		If I approve a sociological treatise which finds that the conditions of life for thousands of infants are in the last degree painful and unhealthy , I can not as a sane man hail unreservedly the `` poetic truth '' that `` Heaven lies about us in our infancy . ''

		If I look about me in the cold , unimpassioned spirit of science and observe that the `` dance of plastic cir - cumstance '' is moulding many human beings into ghastly distortions , I am reluctant to hug to my bosom as a `` poetic truth '' the notion that the play of circumstance is a `` Machinery just meant To give thy Soul its bent , Try thee and turn thee forth , sufficiently impressed . ''

		The word `` truth '' denotes a correspondence be - tween idea and reality .

		`` Poetic truth '' seems to denote a correspondence , not between idea and reality , but between idea and desire .

		I do not challenge for a moment the right of poetry `` to build a shadowy isle of bliss , Midmost the beating of the steely sea '' of reality .

		I have a considerable appetite for such poetry , and indulge this appetite with avidity and without scruple .

		Yet I can not call such poetry truth .

		It seems to me no more worthy of the name than a boy 's boast that his father has a
billion dollars	MONEY	in the bank , a state - ment which , like `` poetic truth , '' corresponds rather to desire than to reality .

		Let me not be misunderstood .

		My protest is lodged solely against those poets and critics who demand of all literature such a manipulation of life as will assort with their a priori theories , and will leave them in much the same mood as a bottle of
Burgundy	LOCATION	.

		I consider that their attempts to dignify such manipulations as `` poetic truth '' or
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 as a `` higher synthesis '' are misleading .

		I consider that to offer these manipulations to the young as | faithful reflections of life , plus something better , !

		is highly pernicious inasmuch as the young are led i to believe that here is at least a faithful reflection of life .

		I consider `` Spoon River '' a ringing chal - lenge to the unreality , the hectic idealism , of much j that passes for classical literature .

		Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	concludes : `` As science ' Spoon River ' needs no apologia ; as poetry , it needs some chloride of lime . ''

		While I believe the inferences one might draw from '' Spoon River '' would closely j resemble the inferences drawn from a sociological survey , yet I doubt whether `` Spoon River '' has < ever been considered as a textbook in sociology .

		I i doubt , then , the first half of that sentence .

		I i utterly deny the second half .

		The implication of j this and of many other references to the book is that it is nothing but a reeking dung-heap .

		The only passages that seem to have left any impression upon Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	are those which refer to the uglier ; phases of the sex impulse .

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's treat - | ment of these phases I welcome on grounds already I stated , along with bis treatment of other sinister i and subterranean things which owe their flourish - j ing condition in part to the fact that people will not look at them .

		If Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	wishes to classify ' himself with those tender intelligences whom we should not introduce into brothels and bedchambers , j let him bowdlerize `` Spoon River , '' along with j Chaucer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the King
James Bible	PERSON	, and several other reputable works .

		But I think he will find that after this is done , about nine-tenths of the book will still remain .

		1
Ingram	PERSON	obtained many prized original Poe manuscripts , most if not all of which he parted with years ago .

		He retained copies , however , and it is reported that his remaining treasures will come to
America	LOCATION	to be sold at auction .

		While the sale may prove most interesting to
Poe	PERSON	students , I fear there will be little to tempt the collector of original
Poe	PERSON	manuscripts .

		Ingrain 's other literary effects will be sold in
London	LOCATION	.

		I had a friendly correspondence with
Ingram	PERSON	, extending through many years .

		He was rather jealous of his reputation as
Poe	PERSON	's biographer , and showed some inclination toward quarrelsomeness .

		Of late years he had lost much , if not all , his ear - lier knack for finding new Poe material , but wrote his numerous correspondents about a final revision of his life of
Poe	PERSON	.

		A correspondent states that
Ingram	PERSON	recently advised him that the new Poe biography was completed .

		As he had written me from year to year that this
Poe	PERSON	volume was about complete , I naturally have some misgivings con - cerning the work .

		Further , I do not believe that he had any new information of bis own that would materially alter his previous publications relating to
Poe	PERSON	, although many new facts have been dis - covered and published by American writers which necessitate a revision of certain epochs in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's life .


Ingram	PERSON	did have , and likely has retained , most of his correspondence with
Poe	PERSON	's women friends , which may throw additional interesting side-lights on
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's romances , especially with `` Annie '' and Mrs.

John H. Ingram	PERSON	, which occurred in
Febru	LOCATION	- ary last , at
Brighton	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		The event was entirely unheralded in the English journals , due probably to the war .


Ingram	PERSON	was a writer of more than ordinary ability .

		He translated a number of volumes , and contributed reviews to leading papers in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		His latest work was on ``
Marlow	PERSON	and his Poetry . ''

		He had also written biographies of
Chatterton	LOCATION	, Mrs.

		But he was best known as the English editor and biographer of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He began his work on
Poe	PERSON	as early as
1874	DATE	, and his more important edition appeared in
1880	DATE	.

		POETICAL PRESCIENCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is of course a common experience , especially with readers of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, that the most f amiliar passage will at times take on a quite fresh and novel significance .

		A case in point may be of interest .

		Recently in reading
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's magnificent `` Anthem of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' the following lines came upon me with a startling power and a mean - ing I had not previously divined : Tarry awhile , lean
Earth	LOCATION	, for thou shalt drink , Even till thy dull throat sicken , The draught thou grow ` st most fat on ; hear ` st thou not The world 's knives bickering in their sheaths ?

		O patience !

		Much offal of a foul world comes tby way , And man 's superfluous cloud shall soon be laid In a little blood .

		Does this not deserve to rank as another instance of that poetical prescience of which
Shelley	PERSON	's fore - cast of his own fate in `` Adonais '' is the classical example ?

		Thompson 's lines make , I think , a fit - ting climax to the mounting trilogy of doom com - posed , besides his own , of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's final stanzas on
Keats	PERSON	and of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's lines on the launch - ing of the `` Titanic . ''

		Certainly these lines seem as near an approach to absolute vision as those famous prophecies .

June 22	DATE	Ax ARISTOCRATIC VOICE ix THE WrLDERXESS .

		* In the fine essay on `` Justice '' which is the heart of Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's new volume , there are many eloquent passages that reveal both the author 's clarity of vision and his weakness .

		He defines an individual 's justice in terms which the student of ethics would find a little dangerous , since Mr.
More	PERSON	's dis - tinction between pleasure and happiness might lend some sanction to the hedonist for plausible misinterpretation .

		But Mr.
More	PERSON	's whole book is a noble damnation of hedonism .

		And the trained student of ethics would read - ily understand the spacious purposes which Mr. More champions .

		No , we have another motive to justice besides the calculation of pleasures or the force of public opinion , a law of reward and punishment that does not follow afar off on limping feet , but is ever at the side of the man when he acts , rather is within him , is his very self .

		The just man may be , and often is , torn by the conflict between the knowledge that he is satis - fying the demands of his reason and the feeling of pain that arises from the suppression of certain desires , but the soul of the just man is nevertheless one soul , not two souls , however it may be divided against itself ; and besides the feelings of pleasure and pain that trouble one of its members , he has another feeling , greater and more intimate , that belongs to his soul as a unit .

		This is the feeling of happiness , which is not the same as - pleasure , and may exist in the absence of pleasure , and despite the presence of pain ; and opposed to it is the feeling of misery , which is not the same as pain , and may exist in the absence of pain , and despite the presence of pleasure .

		It is not easy to explain these things , it may be impossible to analyse them satisfactorily ; but we know that they are so .

		History is replete with illustrations of this strange fact , and he who weighs his own experience honestly will find it there also , that a man conscious of doing what he believes is right , may be lifted up into a supreme happiness , against which the infliction of pain , though it be torture to the death , is as nothing .

		And so a man may enjoy all the pleasures that this world can give , yet suffer a misery for which the only relief is madness .

		Philosophy and history together have given a peculiar fame to the letter sent by
Tiberius	PERSON	to the
Roman Senate	ORGANIZATION	from the luxuries of Caprese : `` May the gods and goddesses bring me to perish more miserably than I daily feel myself to be perishing , if I know what to write to you , Senators , or how to write , or what indeed not to write at this time . ''

		.

		.

		A great English artist who painted the portrait of one of the older generation of our railway financiers , whose name has become also a synonym for the reck - less abuse of power , is said to have observed that the face of his sitter was the most miserable he had ever seen .

		Only the heart of the unjust man knoweth its own bitterness .

		And , in like manner , every just man shall know that happiness is not a balance of pleasure against pain , but a feeling different in kind from pleasure .

		Happiness is a state of the whole * ARISTOCRACY AND JUSTICE .

		soul , embracing both the faculties of reason , on the one hand , and of the desires , with the feelings of pleasure and pain , on the other hand ; or , one might say , it is the state of some superior element of the soul , which finds its good in the harmonious action of those faculties .

		This is indeed a conception of stern freedom that has much in common with the only free - dom worthy the name , a freedom which has been taught with more poetic rapture by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, more rigoristically and formally by
Kant	PERSON	, with a more ardent passion for edifica - tion by
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	, with a more rarified sublimity by
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	, but always by all fine spirits adding new treasures to the blessed and to those who long ardently to be blessed .

		Nevertheless , as a reactionary aristocrat , Mr.
More	PERSON	has at heart a tinge of that kind of individualism which all philosophical idealists regard with some suspicion .

		He dwells much on the reve - lations which come to the individual when he retires within himself .

		But some sort of para - sitism , however lofty , is always a pitfall for the man who indulges too often the highly important practice of retiring within himself and attaining to an ineffable mood , however rarified it be .

		Therefore we can not be sur - prised to find Mr.
More	PERSON	, when he comes to define justice , advocating the imposition of good traditions on an ignorant populace -LRB- the long-distance exhortation of the high-born hermit to a congregation which he is inclined to keep remote and therefore can not know -RRB- .

		To be sure , we are told , with a brevity which seems almost grudging , towards the close of the essay on `` Justice , '' that the moralist may do good work , since `` there is in every heart a spark of reason and gleam of that self - knowledge which is happiness . ''

		I am not in favor of self-sensualizing benevolence or the sympathy which blurs all standards with facile tears .

		But I hold that when Mr.
More	PERSON	contemplates men at large there steals into his thoughts a tinge of that fatalism which has always proved the ultimate ruin of aris - tocracies , political , religious , and artistic , wherever they have been conceived in the thought of feudal king , inflexible priest , or renaissance commentator on Aristotelian can - ons of art .

		Mr.
More	PERSON	's hope of social unity wanes as he contemplates the conflicting wills of the larger self of the community , as if the conflicting wills in the individual were not quite as real and discouraging .

		And when he examines the case for an interna - tional self , a universal humanity with its war - ring wills less crude in their inevitable out - bursts , his angry disbelief bursts forth again and again .

		His words become , after all , but a refined academic version of the familiar sophism , `` You ca n't change human nature . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL I can not subscribe too hearty allegiance to Mr.
More	PERSON	's exhortation to `` reconsider those ideas of justice and discipline and true gov - ernment which we have so lightly thrust aside for flattering liberties of the self-styled New Morality . ''

		But we who have been glad again and again to hail Mr.
More	PERSON	as a master now watch with growing concern and sorrow what seems to us to be a steady crescendo of bitter - ness in his later volumes , that bitterness which isolates and warps the noble mind .

		For my part , as I reread those rich essays on `` Criticism '' and `` Victorian Literature '' in the seventh volume of `` Shelburne Essays , '' and compare them with the stubborn anger of the last two volumes , I can not but wonder if Mr.
More	PERSON	is not shutting himself with too much truculence from the hopes of society to-day .

		Whatever may be said for the value of the hermit 's life in ages past , these are not the days for a St.
Simeon Stylites	PERSON	.

		Of humanitarianism , feminism , socialism , equalitarianism , pacifism , and all the other `` sentimental isms '' against which Mr.
More	PERSON	inveighs so fiercely , there are many kinds .

		Feminists , for instance , may be merely those worthless people who distinguish themselves as `` Bohemians . ''

		They may be men and women who , when they use that vague phrase , `` the single standard of morality , '' mean the single and inarticulate standard of anarchy .

		They are too generally those women and their sentimental male champions or exploiters who execrate all duty and talk loudly about liberty without ever asking the question , `` What is liberty ? ''

		And yet one does not need to be such as these to believe with
Ibsen	PERSON	that `` the social revolution which is impending in
Europe	LOCATION	is chiefly concerned with the workers and the women , '' and with
Karl Pearson	PERSON	that the two great , `` perhaps greatest , '' problems of modern social life are `` the problem of women and the problem of labor . ''

		The danger of Mr.
More	PERSON	's attitude is that he is likely to stone the prophets along with the gaping populace .

		There is not wanting a fair ; number of sensible men and women , with whom Mr.
More	PERSON	could hardly be at serious odds , who would defines feminism soberly enough as that social aspiration which maintains that many of the so-called differences between men and women are not essential ; that the actual differences should be more frankly and intelli - gently studied and stated ; that many injus - tices and misunderstandings and false divisions of labor for which both sexes are responsible may be remedied rationally with - out license , hatred , or scorn on either side .

		The dreams of equalitarianism , which | began to assume the proportions of plausible i phantoms in the English-speaking world soon after Dr. Price delivered the famous sermon which aroused the leonine wrath of
Burke	PERSON	, the dreams which fired the
London Corre	LOCATION	- sponding Society and stirred up the hysterical reaction and oppression of the followers of
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	, the dreams which glowed sombrely on in the half-disillusioned pages of
Godwin	LOCATION	, which flamed out of sight in the benevolent anarchism of
Shelley	LOCATION	, the dreams which inspired the noble but half absurd cry of `` Liberty , equality , fraternity '' and which have inspired our American children to lisp the fallacy that `` all men are -LSB- instead of can be -RSB- created free and equal , '' these are indeed dreams , dreams for which men became mar - tyrs and knights errant , dreams which the world will never forget , but which the world should now regard with something like Mr.
More	PERSON	's healthy scepticism , though without his bitterness .

		Biology alone proves that all men are not created free and equal , at least , according to the current interpretation of the words .

		The Industrial Revolution in Eng - land and the mad prodigality of Jacksonian and of later days in
America	LOCATION	have made such hopes seem more primitively remote in the field of economics than the days of the sabre - toothed tiger .

		Religious deism , philosophical pragmatism , political equalitarianism , eco - nomic laissez-faire , and literary impression - ism have so freely wantoned it that the world cries hold .

		But are there , then , no values to be inherited from all this fine frenzy ?

		There is at least this negative residuum , a spirit of protest against the blind increase of unnec - essary inequality .

		Let us be disillusioned , if you will , out of even a remote hope for a state of equality .

		Let us even choose to look with horror at an unpicturesque world of men created equal .

		We may certainly join Mr.
More	PERSON	heartily in his protest against that sentimental equalitarianism which would attain its end like Spenser 's giant , Therefore I will throw downe these mountaines hie , And make them levell with the lowly plaine : These towring rocks , which reach unto the skie , I will thrust downe into the deepest maine , And as they were , them equalize againe .

		But Mr.
More	PERSON	's hatred of the sentimental levellers dulls the horror which should move him in the midst of the unspeakable mal-dis - tribution of to-day .

		One may hate and defy such conditions without becoming an
I. W. W.	PERSON	-LRB- if , like Mr.
More	PERSON	and myself , one belong to the comfortable middle class -RRB- , or without becoming a reformer whose real aim is to inflate his own egoism ; or one may be defiant without becoming a self-styled progressive who cries , `` For God 's sake let 's do some -
18	DATE	THE DIAL thing ! ''

		Mr.
More	PERSON	can put the case judi - ciously when he cares to : When
Solon	ORGANIZATION	was chosen to reform the Athenian Constitution , a current saying of his , that `` equality breeds no war , '' flattered the turbulent populace into acquiescence because they took the word `` equality '' in its absolute sense .

		Whereas in reality
Solon	ORGANIZATION	was thinking of fair proportion , and on this principle reduced the oppression of the rich , while refusing to the poor an equalitarian Constitution .

		He saw , as we must see to-day , that the ideal of absolute equality is not only impossible in practice , but is contrary to our sense of justice .

		But the fine scorn which Mr. More pours on demagogue-reformers and restless poor is not balanced by an equal sceva indignatio against the predatory captain of industry and the standards of inequality which identify the rich and the best .

		It is to be feared that many a Gryll of modern business , if accident guided him stumbling through such a '' high - brow '' book as this , would commemorate with his friends the discovery of their Bible with all the enthusiasm of a witches ' sabbath .

		And though this predatory
Gryll	PERSON	would grossly misinterpret a distinguished and noble book , he would not caricature it much more than Mr.
More	PERSON	caricatures those modern move - ments which he recklessly bundles together as `` sentimental isms . ''

		Mr.
More	PERSON	forgets him - self too often , and paints the world too simply in radical black and conservative white .

		It was not thus that
Immanuel Kant	PERSON	, in the face of two warring arrays of thought , set to work to build up a criticism which would reconcile pedantic rationalist and bankrupt empiricist .

		Mr.
More	PERSON	's criticism is not that of reconcili - ation , the stern reconciliation which makes its synthesis of the best in two opposites by means of a katharsis of both .

		His is the method of the golden mean , a view which has had in it always , from the days of Aris - totle , too much of scorn , too little of open - mindedness , a view which fights an unselec - tive sympathy with a too selective hauteur .

		Among Mr.
More	PERSON	's other `` sentimental isms , '' humanitarianism is almost a generic term covering the rest .

		But we may group under this head his attack on `` The New Morality , '' and his scarification of our undis - ciplined education , together with his defence of discipline -LRB- `` Academic Leadership '' -RRB- .

		As in his other protests , Mr.
More	PERSON	's fundamental principle that `` equality of opportunity is an ideal to be aimed at '' but `` a small thing in comparison with universality of duty '' is clear-sighted and lofty , commanding our allegiance .

		He is quite right in noting the unevenness of Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	's work .

		But when he comes to practical affairs and detailed analysis , the spirit of the reactionary clouds his vision , and his flings at the mistress of
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	approach perilously near to libel .

		His emotions blur his logic , and in attacking her `` Spirit of Youth and the City Streets '' he blames Miss Addams for supposing that our poverty-stricken youth become law - breakers because of their heavy and prema - ture responsibilities and their lack of amuse - ments .

		By way of refutation he reminds us that
Harry Thaw	PERSON	was also a criminal .

		Does he mean to imply that because
Harry Thaw	PERSON	had little or no restraint all restraints are good ?

		Does he mean to imply that because Thaw had no responsibilities and therefore became a criminal that he who has the responsibilities imposed in a sweat-shop should be expected to preserve his righteousness ?

		Does he sup - pose that Miss Addams would remove the really fine restraints of life from her wards submerged in the gutter or the factory ?

		Miss Addams does indeed overleap herself at times .

		But let me remind the reader of her funda - mental thesis in `` Youth and the City Streets '' : A certain number of the outrages upon the spirit of youth may be traced to degenerate or careless parents who totally neglect their responsibilities ; a certain other large number of wrongs are due to sordid men and women who deliberately use the legitimate pleasure-seeking of young people as lures into vice .

		There remains , however , a third very large class of offenses for which the community as a whole must be held responsible if it would escape the condemnation , `` Woe unto him by whom offenses come . ''

		This class of offenses is traceable to a dense ignorance on the part of the average citizen as to the requirements of youth , and to a persistent blind - ness on the part of educators as to youth 's most obvious needs .

		Is this thesis sentimental ?

		And what , apart from the fine but abstract moral dictum already quoted , does Mr.
More	PERSON	set up against this point of view by way of actually right - ing a hideous wrong ?

		He tells a man how to get true enlightenment as follows : Let him shut out the voices of the world and dis - regard the stream of informing books which pour upon him from the modern press , as the `` floud of poyson '' was spewed upon Spenser 's Knight from `` Errours den . ''

		.

		.

		Let him retire into himself , and in the silence of such recollection examine his own motives and the sources of his self - approval and discontent .

		He will discover there in that dialogue with himself , if his abstraction is complete and sin - cere , that his nature is not simple and single , but dual , and the consequences to him in his judgment of life and in his conduct will be of incalculable importance .

		He will learn , with a conviction which no science or philosophy falsely so-called can shake , that beside the passions and wandering desires and blind impulses and the cravings for pleasure and the prod of sensations there is something within him and a part of him , rather in some way his truer self , which controls and checks and knows and pro- nounces judgment , unmoved amid all motion , un - changed amid continual change , of everlasting validity above the shifting valuations of the moment .

		He may not be able to express this insight in terms
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 19 that will satisfy his own reason or will convince others , but if his insight is true he will not waver in loyalty to it , though he may sin against it times with - out number in spoken word and impulsive deed .

		Bather , his loyalty will be confirmed by experience .

		For he will discover that there is a happiness of the soul which is not the same as the pleasure of ful - filled desires , whether these be for good or for ill , a happiness which is not dependent upon the results of this or that choice among our desires , but upon the very act itself of choice and self-control , and which grows with the habit of staying the throng of besetting and conflicting impulses always until the judicial fiat has been pronounced .

		It is thus that happiness is the final test of morality , bringing with it a sense of responsibility to the supernatural com - mand within the soul of the man himself , as binding as the laws of religion and based on no disputable revelation or outer authority .

		Such a morality is neither old nor new , and stands above the varying customs of society .

		It is not determined essentially by the relation of a man to his fellows or by their approval , but by the consciousness of lightness in the man 's own breast , in a word , by character .

		Its works are temperance , truth , honesty , trustworthi - ness , fortitude , magnanimity , elevation ; and its crown is joy .

		This passage is so eloquent and so profoundly suggestive that one dislikes to carp over it .

		Nevertheless , let me add this anticlimax : Is -LRB- it quite safe for the censor to defy Miss Addams 's emotionalism with such intuitional - ism , lofty though it be ?

		This `` insight '' which you and I `` may not express , '' what is its basis !

		Why is it valid ?

		Why should we not choose rather
Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	as our criterion ?

		I have the warmest sym - pathy for the mysticism of Mr.
More	PERSON	, but I object when he brings mysticism into the field of polemics against Miss Addams or any other exponent of `` the New Morality . ''

		And I i remind the reader of my earlier warning that mysticism , in such situations , invites the perils of parasitism .

		Again , in matters educational , Mr.
More	PERSON	pleads for sound principles : A manifest condition is that education should embrace the means of discipline , for without dis - cipline the mind will remain inefficient just as surely as the muscles of the body , without exercise , will be left flaccid .

		But , on the whole , Mr.
More	PERSON	is too optimistic about the teaching of English Literature in its present senile state .

		You may , for instance , if by extraordinary luck you get the perfect teacher , make English Literature disciplinary by the hard manipulation of ideas ; but in practice it almost invariably happens that a course in English Literature degenerates into the dull mem - orizing of dates and names or , rising into the O Altitude , evaporates into romantic gush over beau - tiful passages .

		I doubt whether our generation will live to i see the teaching of English Literature raised above the standards which Mr. More so justly condemns , to the dignity of a disciplinary subject .

		He has a conclusive answer to a prevalent utilitarian sophistry : The disagreement in this matter would no doubt be less , were it not for an ambiguity in the meaning of the word `` efficient '' itself .

		There is a kind of efficiency in managing men , and there is also an intel - lectual efficiency , properly speaking , which is quite a different faculty .

		The former is more likely to be found in the successful engineer or business man than in the scholar of secluded habits , and because often such men of affairs received no discipline at college in the classics the argument runs that utilitarian studies are as disciplinary as the humanistic .

		But efficiency of this kind is not an academic product at all , and is commonly developed , and should be devel - oped , in the school of the world .

		It comes from dealing with men in matters of large physical moment , and may exist in a mind utterly undisciplined in the stricter sense of the word .

		We have had more than one illustrious example in recent years of men cap - able of dominating their fellows , let us say in financial transactions , who yet , in the grasp of first principles and in the analysis of consequences , have shown them - selves to be as inefficient as children .

		But the reactionary attitude eternally recurs .

		Though he realizes that teachers themselves have debauched the value of Greek and Latin classics by using them as a basis for the `` dry rot of philology , '' Mr.
More	PERSON	must nevertheless right about face and march us back to the good old days when the classics were required as the spine of college education .

		I have already seconded his plea for discipline .

		But we must remember that `` influence , '' as New - man calls the opposite of discipline , has made real strides under the guidance of a
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	, a
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	, a
Charles William Eliot	PERSON	.

		It is not so much that we have too much influence as that we have a twentieth century influence coupled with occasional spasmodic and mori - bund revivals of an ancient discipline tainted with suspicion and revenge , discipline that alphabetizes seats and pupils , discipline that calls upon the teacher to be a special dispen - sating
Providence	LOCATION	, discipline which sucks away the wills of students and makes them automatons , discipline which has so mis - handled the ancient classics that they must lie fallow while their loving guardians plan new ways of fitting them into a curriculum which has necessarily grown far more com - plex .

		Of course we have but very little of this feudal discipline which lags so far behind influence in development .

		It is , however , about the only kind we have when we have any .

		The problem is not so much to inhibit influence which has so richly developed but to wed it to a twentieth century discipline , a discipline that will be modern in the best sense , that is to say , compounded of eternally valid principles of men like
Plato	PERSON	, yet set forth in symbols and practices intelligible to students to-day and related intimately to the dilemmas of contemporary life .

		Since the 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	teachers of the classics have devastated their own subjects much more than the utilitarian public , it will not do to advocate a renaissance till we have teachers who possess the genius to present and reinterpret the majestic ancients to a young and wilful generation .

		We can not walk backwards .

		Space forbids discussion of the other absorb - ing problems which Mr. More raises .

		Always my results are the same .

		When , for instance , he writes of `` Property and Law '' I agree with his principle that `` If property is secure , it may be the means to an end , whereas if it is insecure it will be the end in itself . ''

		But I can not extol , as he does , the ancient virtues engendered by private property without remembering that some kinds of private prop - erty are `` private '' in a sense unknown two centuries ago , and their influences on their owner are ethically such that they can not arouse the old spartan integrity , the old Horatian tenderness and solicitude .

		I should like to make this essay and the one entitled `` The Philosophy of the War '' the basis for an analysis of Mr.
More	PERSON	's last two `` sentimental isms , '' socialism and pacifism .

		But my reader will readily guess that my reflections fall into the same duality of agreement and disagreement .

		The man who to-day calls himself either a radical or a conservative is very likely to be a superficial man .

		Many of us will be dubious about the soundness of any all - embracing contempt for all aspects of all modern movements .

		Such a sweeping con - tempt I am sure Mr.
More	PERSON	does not intend , though his growing aloofness and growing bitterness often imply it .

		No vigorous thinker will deny the importance of his plea for some restoration of aristocratic values .

		In this age of imperialism , when we have a chaos of petty loyalties , an age of what
Hegel	PERSON	calls `` the self-estranged social mind , '' an age in which , as
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	warns us , communi - ties invite convulsion and ruin , reactionary aesthetes and moralists and politicians cry out for aristocracy .

		They are right in this respect : the stability of aristocracy gave the leisure necessary for the development of that kind of spirit which makes its economic necessities beautiful to a considerable extent .

		If the middle-class democratic regime were not unstable it would have a great art .

		Our factories would rise like temples of a miracu - lously new style in architecture .

		Our lab - orers would not be the slaves of machines , and we should have no
H. G. Wells	PERSON	to dream of an evolutionary conquest of men by engines endowed by man 's blind cunning with some hideous impassive intelligence .

		Machines would be our slaves , the only slaves in the world .


Buskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	were partly right and partly wrong in their diagnosis of the Industrial Revolution .

		Shortsighted bucca - neers of the market-place have wantonly befouled our lives .

		It was not , however , because machinery was invented and factories planted beside the sweetly garrulous and hith - erto unsullied streams , it was not because the air was made grim with canopies of smoke or because the new powers of steam dragged men and women and children from their homes , that art and morality and religion fell .

		These things were bound to be .

		These things , though evil , will , if treated with defi - ance and mastery , prove to be fragments of the good .

		To destroy machinery and factor - ies would be to destroy progress .

		But just here the lovers of art and ethics and religion may well try to make a synthesis of the best in the irregular prophecies of men like
Kuskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	with the more logical but half - fatalistic analysis and forecast of
Karl Marx	PERSON	.

		Let economic conditions fall under a regime more stable .

		The democratic bourgeoisie have so ordered things , says
Marx	PERSON	, that life is full of capricious vicissitudes .

		Petty capitalists are crowded into the proletariat .

		Bankruptcies abound even among the larger capitalists .

		Panics and that condition absurdly called `` prosperity '' alternate with implacable certainty yet caprice .

		Interna - tional wars follow as larger expressions of the growing socialization of the means of produc - tion combined with an irreconcilable anarchy of control by a fortuitously elevated minority of uncritical minds .

		Always the world is full of paupers and nouveau riche .

		Now the lat - ter , as
Euskin	LOCATION	and
Morris	PERSON	knew , are always vulgar .

		And before they can develop aesthet - ically and ethically their money evaporates , and we have to devise a new travesty of art and of morals for a new crop of nouveau riche .

		But shall we , then , return to the feudal aristocracy which
Edmund Burke	PERSON	admired ?

		It is impossible , desire it who will .

		Men like
Carlyle	PERSON	, Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, and Mr.
More	PERSON	forget the impossibility of going back , forget the old sins and the old fatalism that ultimately made intolerable all aristocracies hitherto conceived .

		Let us restore in their essential significance many aristocratic ideals .

		Per - haps , by some strange yet beneficent irony of progress , the wildest prophecies of
Karl Marx	ORGANIZATION	will come true , and the advancing proletariat will restore stability and many of the ideals of aristocracy , its ancient ally against the bourgeoisie .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 21 JAP AX : FRIEXD OR FOE ?

		* Three new volumes testify that the Japa - nese Problem is still with us , even when the
California	LOCATION	Legislature is not in session .

		A year or so ago the discussion turned on the question of immigration , and we had con - tributions by Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	, Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	, and Professor
Millis	PERSON	.

		Now the broader question of national policy holds the attention of the writers , and the conclusions presented are as diverse as you please .


Japan	LOCATION	is a friend or foe depending on which of the volumes before us is read first and accepted unreservedly .

		The three authors represent very different trainings and points of view .

		Mr.
Crow	PERSON	is a journalist who served for eighteen months on an English newspaper in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		His treatment is that of the modern journalist , attractive in style but careless in statement for newswriting allows little time for verifi - cation ; and he is inclined to make assertions that can not possibly be proved and yet which may possess an element of truth .

		Although he assures us that he has studied '' past his - tory '' in order to estimate
Japan	LOCATION	's future policy , yet there is no internal evidence to show that he has any sound understanding of the events of the last half-century which moulded modern
Japan	LOCATION	.

		President
Scherer	PERSON	and Professor
Abbott	PERSON	both played a part in the making of
New Japan	LOCATION	.

		The former served as a teacher of English in
Japan	LOCATION	from
1892	DATE	to
1896	DATE	, and the latter as a teacher of Zoology from
1900	DATE	to
1903	DATE	.

		President
Scherer	PERSON	has already given us two books on
Japan	LOCATION	which were very much worth while .

		It is of interest to note that the two men who lived longest in
Japan	LOCATION	and were in most intimate contact with the Japanese should agree in con - clusions almost diametrically opposite to those of the journalist .

		But in doing so they run the risk of being classed by Mr.
Crow	PERSON	* with the other '' misguided and deluded American friends '' of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		In ``
Japan	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	: A Contrast . ''

		Mr.
Crow	PERSON	endeavors to show that the
United States	LOCATION	is at present the great barrier to
Japan	LOCATION	's imperial ambitions in
Asia	LOCATION	, the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and the
Americas	LOCATION	, and that the war clans of
Japan	LOCATION	have selected this country as their probable enemy .

		`` To break the
United States	LOCATION	is necessary for the fulfilment of
Japan	LOCATION	's ambitions . ''

		And his concluding sen - tence reads : ``

		the
United States	LOCATION	but to all Western civiliza - tion , but our protection is found in the inher - ent weakness of the Japanese state , '' On the other hand , Professor
Abbott	PERSON	finds
Japan	LOCATION	facing squarely toward
Asia	LOCATION	, with problems in
Korea	LOCATION	,
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	proper which will occupy all her energies , and with no thought of embroiling herself with the
United States	LOCATION	provided we allow her to work out unhindered her
Asiatic `` Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The armaments which Mr.
Crow	PERSON	tells us are being prepared against
America	LOCATION	are , acording to Professor
Abbott	PERSON	, needed because of her Asiatic responsibilities .

		The most valuable portions of Mr.
Crow	PERSON	's volume are those describing conditions in
Japan	LOCATION	to-day .

		His picture of poverty , heavy taxation , and retarded social development seems to weaken the force of his thesis that so harassed a country could at the same time impose its will upon
China	LOCATION	, with her three or four hundred millions of people , and the
United States	LOCATION	, with her millions of men and treasure and boundless energy .

		The thought - ful reader will note a number of errors of fact and of interpretation , and a few irrecon - cilable statements .

		We are told that `` the Japanese cultivates with intense care the small plot of land which belongs to him , but centuries of life in a country where all indi - vidualism and all initiative in the lower classes were crushed out of existence have left him without a mentality to conceive the possibilities of an uncultivated hillside , or a piece of unimproved plain more than a day 's journey from his native village . ''

		Then why should we fear `` a flood of cheap Oriental labor with yellow morals to flood the west coast of
America	LOCATION	'' ?

		There seems to be some contradiction here .

		Professor
Abbott	PERSON	's treatment of `` Japa - nese Expansion and American Policies '' is a sober and well-reasoned study .

		He presents a sympathetic account of the development of
Japan	LOCATION	in the Meiji era , points out her present problems , and finds their solution in the industrial and commercial field , with
China	LOCATION	as her most vital market .

		He sees no danger in our relations with
Japan	LOCATION	, unless we pro- voke it ; and one of the strong appeals in his books is for a libel law to protect nations as well as individuals , and thus bring to an end the slanders , accusations , and aspersions of motives which now are disseminated in certain quarters in
Japan	LOCATION	and this country .

		He also advocates an international conference on Pacific problems , to be participated in by all the states and dependencies situated around its shores .

		In the three historical chapters a number of errors of fact are found .

		Both 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	Professor
Abbott	PERSON	and Mr.
Crow	PERSON	keep alive the fiction that
Great Britain	LOCATION	revised her treaty with
Japan	LOCATION	in
1894	DATE	because of the latter 's success in the war with
China	LOCATION	.

		As a matter of fact , the treaty was signed before war was declared .

		President
Scherer	PERSON	's little volume on `` The Japanese Crisis '' deals primarily with the
California	LOCATION	phase of the question .

		He believes that
California	LOCATION	was right in desiring to pre - vent Japanese ownership of land , but wrong in the method used , for a non-discriminatory law would have been better and quite unob - jectionable .

		While believing in the possi - bility of both racial and social assimilation of the Japanese , he feels that the time is not ripe for either .

		The danger in our relations with
Japan	LOCATION	lies not in the government , `` one of the wisest and most cool-headed '' in the world , but in some `` sensitive popular explo - sion . ''

		`` He who lightly applies a match to this tinder is , however ignorant or thought - less , a criminal against the human race . ''

		And his conclusion is this : '' The most import - ant piece of legislation still waiting to be done in this country is the enactment of a law or laws , by constitutional amendment if necess - ary , that will put international affairs in the hands of the nation .

		Meanwhile , let us trust
Japan	LOCATION	's honor to maintain the Gentlemen 's Agreement , and burnish our own by wiping away discrimination . ''

		p AYSON ^ TREAT > Two SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY PLAYS .

		* As one reads the book of the enormous `` community masque of the Art of the The - atre '' written by Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	for the
Shakespeare Celebration Committee	ORGANIZATION	of
New York City	LOCATION	, one can not help wondering what
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	would think of it .

		Probably he would have liked to see the pageant ; but I am confident that nothing would have induced him to read the book .

		The pageant is impres - sive by its very size and splendor , and by the beauty of the settings designed by Messrs. Urban and
Jones	PERSON	; but it is hard to believe that the spectators can receive any unified impression from it .

		The newspaper reports say that `` its chief success was in the appeal to the eye , '' and that `` it was more of a pag - eant and less of anything else than its author appears to have intended . ''

		and dramatists of all ages and nations ; char - acters and scenes mythological , legendary , and historical ; a number of scenes from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		But all these things are only interludes in a frigid and vague alle - gory which is intended to hold them together and unify them .

		In the mind of the reader , at least , the allegory does not accomplish its purpose .

		Perhaps the task of revivifying allegory as a literary form is at present a hopeless one ; certainly Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	has failed in it .

		He has rashly borrowed the four central char - acters of his masque from `` The Tempest , ''
Caliban	PERSON	,
Prospero	ORGANIZATION	,
Miranda	LOCATION	, and
Ariel	PERSON	, and , as he says , `` re-imagined '' them .

		Rather , I think , he has `` de-imagined '' them : he has left out of them nearly all that makes their potent appeal to the imagination .

		It is quite needless for him to add : `` They are thus no longer
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's characters of ` The Tempest ' '' !

		The magic is gone out of deli - cate
Ariel	LOCATION	; Prospero and
Miranda	PERSON	are become vague shadows ;
Caliban	LOCATION	alone is conceived and presented with something of imaginative power .

		In a recent article in `` The Nation , '' Mr.
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	remarks : `` I am sorry for those who do not believe that the enchanted island of ` The Tempest ' is man 's universe , presented first in a state of insur - rection , and then in a state of tranquillity . ''

		I am willing to accept my portion of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's pity , which is no doubt kindly meant ; but a reading of Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	's masque would suggest to him , I think , that the pity might be better bestowed on the alle - gory-spinners .

		For my part , I feel sincerely sorry for those who can not enjoy `` The Tempest '' as the most delightful of all won - der stories , illuminated by the wisdom of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's experience , without reading into it a frigid allegorical meaning .

		In the masque the magic isle is man 's universe ; and

		It is only fair to add that Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	has been more successful in the details of his work than in its main outlines ; much of his verse is graceful and attractive .

		It is a relief , however , to turn to a simpler and less ambitious undertaking .

		Mr.
Burrill	PERSON	's `` Master Skylark '' is a dramatization of the story by Mr.
John Bennett	PERSON	which appeared serially in `` St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' some years ago r and has retained its popularity in book form .

		The story concerns
Nick Attwood	PERSON	, a boy
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 23 singer of
Stratford	LOCATION	, who is kidnapped and carried off to
London	LOCATION	by
Gaston Carew	PERSON	, one of the
Lord Admiral	ORGANIZATION	's company of players .

		There his voice wins him fame ; he sings before the Queen , and is befriended by Hey - wood and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		After
Carew	PERSON	is imprisoned ,
Nick	PERSON	escapes with
Carew	PERSON	's little daughter from the brutal servant who intends to dispose of them both to his own profit , and finds his way back to
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		The story is a pretty one , and Mr.
Burrill	PERSON	has drama - tized it with a good deal of skill .

		But
Nick	PERSON	's adventures do not fit easily into the form of a play ; some of them have to be introduced indirectly , and the action lacks continuity .

		Moreover , Mr.
Burrill	PERSON	-LRB- or perhaps Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	-RRB- is never quite at his ease in
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan English , so that the dialogue is often stiff or cumbersome .

		The play is intended chiefly for amateurs ; but it would require considerable resources in the way of setting , and the parts would be wearisome to learn .

		For reading , the narrative version of the story would .

		I should suppose , be preferable .

		On the whole , both of these plays suggest that it is wiser not to try to write plays about

		OUR SUMMER IN THE VALE OF

		By

		Illustrated .


Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. :
James William Bryan Press	PERSON	.

		The big-game hunter , Mr.
Harry A. Auer	PERSON	, tells the story of an Alaskan expedition in the late
summer	DATE	and
early autumn of 1914	DATE	.

		Five huntsmen , including the writer , took steamer from
Seattle	LOCATION	to
Skagway	LOCATION	, crossed the White Pass by rail to
White Horse	ORGANIZATION	, and thence by pack train proceeded northwestward to the eastern slopes of the coast range , where Mt.
St. Elias	LOCATION	and Mt.
Natazhat	PERSON	lift their snowy peaks to the sky .

		In diary form , and appar - ently with no romancing after the event , the account of `` Camp Fires in the Yukon '' fills two hundred pages , with numerous excellent views from photographs .

		The purpose of the trip , the bagging of big and smaller game , the study of the wild life of the far North , and the contemplation of Nature in her more majestic aspects , seems to have been satis - factorily accomplished .

		The author of `` Brown Waters , '' Mr.
W. H. Blake	PERSON	, finds his chief delight rather in fishing than in hunting .

		`` All pleasures but the angler 's being , i ' th ' tail , repentance like a sting , '' he quotes from
Thomas Weaver	PERSON	on his title-page ; and in the body of his book he animadverts upon `` the man whose pur - pose in carrying a rifle through the woods begins and ends with the death of an animal . ''

		Why is it , one might ask , that the jerking of a fish from its native element to gasp out its life in slow agony is considered so much gent - ler a practice than the shooting of game ?

		Perhaps partly because the mammalia are more nearly related to us than are the pisces - do in fact include us .

		Eight chapters of Canadian rambling , with rod and rifle not too conspicuously in evidence , make up the book , whose graces of style are above the ordi - nary .

		Parts of it had already appeared in `` The University Magazine . ''

		In harmony with the title is the following from the initial chapter : But dearest to the fisherman 's heart is the honest brown water , natural and proper home of the trout , turning the sands beneath to gold , of patterns that ever change and fleet when the sun strikes through the ripple .

		Western hunting adventures , glimpses of ranch life , memories of the African wilds , bits of unusual experience in the great out - of-doors far from civilization , with scattered reflections and fragments of varied and unex - pected information , all set down with rapid pen and in a contagious spirit of zestful enjoy - ment , make up the bulk of `` A Book-Lover 's Holidays in the Open , '' by
Colonel Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		In an eloquently written preface that shows the author at his best in a literary sense , the lover of outdoor life and adventure is advised to `` take books with him as he journeys ; for the keenest enjoyment of the wilderness is 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	reserved for him who enjoys also the garnered wisdom of the present and the past . ''

		In further justification of the first part of his chosen title , the author inserts a chapter on `` Books for Holidays in the Open , '' wherein his own wide-ranging literary preferences find free expression , with no tiresome insist - ence that they should be the preferences of others .

		In the fewest possible words one is counselled to choose for holiday excursions `` the same books one would read at home . ''

		Here is a characteristic passage from this chapter : Then , if one is worried by all kinds of men and events during critical periods in administrative office , or at national conventions , or during con - gressional investigations , or in hard-fought political campaigns it is the greatest relief and unalloyed delight to take up some really good , some really enthralling book
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	,
Thueydides	LOCATION	,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	,
Polybius	LOCATION	, or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, Gray , or
Lowell	PERSON	and lose all memory of everything grimy , and of all the baseness that must be parried or conquered .

		Another writer who finds recreation and spiritual refreshment in the study of nature is Mr.
John B. Henderson	PERSON	, known for his book on `` American Diplomatic Questions , '' and now offering his readers a full account , unusu - ally well illustrated with photographs and colored drawings , of `` The Cruise of the
Tomas Barrera	PERSON	. ''

		It is `` the narrative of a scientific expedition to
Western Cuba	LOCATION	and the
Colorados Eeefs	ORGANIZATION	, with observations on the geology , fauna , and flora of the regions . ''

		The vessel named in the title is a fishing schooner , `` a splendid boat , '' lent without charge to the exploring party of seventeen , of which the author was one of the half-dozen naturalists .

		The trip covered the month from
May 8	DATE	to
June 9 , 1914	DATE	, much material was collected and `` consigned to the various spe - cialists who will in due time report upon it , '' and the whole adventure proved `` a delightful outing and most successful collecting expedi - tion . ''

		Presented in diary form , the narrative gives the impression of careful observation and painstaking endeavor to be accurate in every detail of the record , which at the same time is not too technical to be enjoyable to readers other than professed naturalists .

		The author of `` Letters to My Son , '' `` More Letters to My Son , '' and , despite the seeming incompatibility , `` Letters of a Spinster , '' offers still another volume of let - ters , this time from
Panama	LOCATION	, and addressed to ``
Phillipa	PERSON	, '' an intimate friend `` back home '' -LRB- in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- to whom all sorts of amusing trivialities as well as more serious concerns may be unreservedly confided .

		Miss
Winifred James	PERSON	calls her latest work `` A Woman in the Wilderness , '' though the
Panama	LOCATION	of to-day is not exactly a trackless jungle or an untrodden desert .

		The period covered is the thirteen months from
June 1 , 1914	DATE	to
July , 1915	DATE	, and the chronicle natur - ally touches occasionally on the war ; it also includes frequent references to the writer 's American husband -LRB- of recent and of course imaginary acquisition -RRB- named
William	PERSON	.

		Local color is laid on in sufficient thickness to complete the illusion , if it be an illusion , of the author 's actual presence in the tropical region where she is supposed to be writing .

		It is in fact , as her publishers announce , `` a book of rollicking realism . ''

		Passing further southward , we come to the South American countries lately visited by our indefatigable ex-President and partly described by him in `` Through the Brazilian Wilderness , '' and now more fully depicted by his eminent associate in that expedition , the Rev.
J. A. Zahm	PERSON	.

		The scientific results of that exploration having already been recorded in the aforementioned book , Dr.
Zahm	PERSON	confines himself almost entirely to the more generally interesting incidents of the journey and a description of the places visited by him in company with Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		His interests , as is shown in earlier books from his pen , are centred in the history , the poetry , and the romance of the regions through which the party journeyed .

		Five hundred generous pages are devoted to this history , poetry , and romance ; and sixty-four illustrations , with a map , add vividness to the whole , which bears the title , `` Through
South America	LOCATION	's South - land , with an Account of the
Roosevelt Scientific Expedition	ORGANIZATION	to
South America	LOCATION	. ''

		As one of many evidences of a rather unexpected enlightenment among the South American republics let us quote a short passage .

		After referring to the material splendors of
Buenos Aires	PERSON	, the writer continues : But they reveal but imperfectly the ideals and aspirations of its inhabitants .

		To understand these , one must visit some of their numerous and perfectly equipped charitable and educational institutions .

		These are the pride of every true Argentine and are , more than anything else , an indication of the real character of the people .

		They exhibit the promise and the potency of the republic 's future as does nothing else , and show the spirit of solidarity and cooperation which are daily becoming more marked characteristics of the dominating element of the Argentine nation .

		Transferring our attention now to the eastern hemisphere , we take up an inviting little book by Mr.
F. S. Salisbury	PERSON	on `` Ram - bles in the Vaudese Alps , '' wherein occurs the early and sensible caution , `` Do n't take your holiday with a rush if you mean it to be any good to you .

		Take the first day or two quietly and slide gently into it . ''

		A
summer	DATE	vacation spent at Gryon in
1908	DATE	laid the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 foundations of the book , in which it is hoped that the lover of alpine flowers will find things of interest , as also those who delight espe - cially in the scenery and atmosphere of the Alps .

		Faithful camera pictures of flower and landscape illustrate the botanizer 's genially rambling narrative .

		It is amusing to read of the little bunches of edelweiss sold in the shops as souvenirs of Swiss mountaineering , and not uncommonly cut artfully out of flan - nel in fact , `` made in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' and war - ranted to wash .

		In poetic charm , in pleasing imagery , in apt allusion to history and tradition , Dr.
Ralcy Husted Bell	PERSON	's `` Taormina '' is sure to give satisfaction to lovers of travel books that are at the same time something more than bare itineraries or clever chronicles of per - sonal adventure and experience .

		Few
Sicil	PERSON	- ian towns are richer in antiquities or have a more interesting history than the ancient Tauromenium , founded twenty-three cen - turies ago and repeatedly the victim of siege and assault , The present account of its undy - ing charms and its marked peculiarities owes its origin to the author 's accidental detention amid its hoary ruins in the course of a pro- jected tour of the island three years ago .

		Thus he had ample opportunity to study its past and note the survivals of that past in its present state .

		He writes of its origin , early inhabitants , language , ancient ruins , ancient products , present peculiarities , and other like matters , illustrating the whole with many pho - tographic views .

		Novelty of interest abounds in Mr.
W. C. Scully	PERSON	's story of his toilsome journeys across the
Bushmanland Desert	LOCATION	in
South Africa	LOCATION	, a little known tract of arid wilderness fifty thousand square miles in extent .

		`` Lodges in the Wilderness '' the author calls his book , a title true to the contents , and a prefatory note explains that the travels described `` were undertaken in the Nineties by the author when
Special Magistrate	ORGANIZATION	for the
Northern Border	ORGANIZATION	of the
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	, - an office of which he was the last incumbent , and which has since lapsed . ''

		In compliment to the writer 's realism it must be said that his pages seem to shimmer with the heat and to be parched with the thirst of the great desert where his scene is laid ; and so the book is not the best of
summer	DATE	reading unless the reader be fortified with cooling drinks and comfortably disposed in the shade of that luxuriant foliage which he will nowhere find in the pages before him .

		Enjoyable , amid these sandy aridities , is the not infrequent literary allusion or unobtrusive hint of more liberal studies than might have been expected in a South African magistrate .

		But the critic must note his misspelling of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's name , or perhaps it were more charitable to throw the blame on the long-suffering and safely anonymous compositor .

		In conclusion , we will quote a passage descriptive of some of the inhabitants of this ill-favored region : It was the eyes of those half - breeds that were most distinctive .

		These were dusky and deep , with an expression not exactly furtive ; rather expressive of haunting apprehension .

		This was hardly to be won - dered at , for they had ceaselessly to watch for every change in the desert 's pitiless visage to note each alteration in the moods of earth and sky .

		Their lives were spent in answering a succession of riddles pro- pounded by the terrible sphinx between whose taloned paws they existed as playthings .

		Describing himself as arriving at
Manila	LOCATION	from
Hong Kong	LOCATION	`` with a pea-green complex - ion , caused by the pranks of a typhoon , '' and `` in a blue funk '' from sea-sickness , and , fur - ther to heighten the chromatic effect , `` looking greenery-yallery '' as he disembarked at the hot landing-stage , Mr.
Walter H. Young	PERSON	pro- ceeds in rollicking vein to detail the indoor and outdoor adventures of `` A Merry Banker in the Far East -LRB- and
South America	LOCATION	-RRB- . ''

		Sportsman no less than banker , he shows as much zest for snipe-shooting in the paddy - fields of Penang as for high finance in
Iloilo	LOCATION	; and so his amusing narrative may not inap - propriately be grouped with the accompany - ing volumes of open-air literature .

		Romance , mildly incipient , adds its savor to the chroni - cle , as where the author allowed himself to cherish so tender a feeling for a certain Span - ish damsel in
the Philippines	LOCATION	that their part - ing caused him , as he expressed it , a pain in his pantry .

		A paragraph from the chapter on ``
Patagonia	LOCATION	Patter '' will serve to illustrate the nature and style of the book : I had already made up my mind to buy a bit of camp for myself as a little reserve fund , in case the directors should at some time turn nasty .

		I could then put on my hat , retire to my spot in the wilder - ness and politely tell them to go to
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		You never know your luck with directors , for a touch of liver in
London	LOCATION	may lose you a comfortable job in
South America	LOCATION	.

		To many readers the Vale of Cashmere will have no very definite existence outside the pages of `` Lalla Rookh , '' and even there its geography is delightfully vague .

		But those who turn the leaves of Dr.
F. Ward Denys	PERSON	's sumptuous volume , '' Our
Summer	DATE	in the Vale of
Kashmir	LOCATION	'' can hardly fail to gain more precise knowledge of its location .

		Not the poetry and charm only of
Kashmir	LOCATION	, not indeed these chiefly , but the prosaic and sometimes homely realities of the country and its people and modes of life are presented in the faith - fully and minutely descriptive chapters of the book .

		Its author has lived long amid the 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	scenes depicted , and is said to be the first American to relate his experiences in that far-off land .

		He writes about scenery , people , native industries , shops and bazaars , social life , sports , schools , houseboats and cottages , the Eesidency , the Maharaja , and other per - tinent themes ; and his handsome book is adorned with colored drawings , colored pho - tographs , and other illustrations .

		It is a notable specimen of the fine art of book-manu - facture , and , best of all , thoroughly readable .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* There have been many stories of the great West in more or less recent fiction , and doubt - less everyone has his favorites , if he conde - scends to such reading at all .

		I myself have never seen the like of Hop-along Cassidy : I should be sorry at his non-appearance of late were it not that I long ago saw that he would in no long time kill all the bad men of the west , and be reduced to a forced quies - cence , like Alexander the Great .

		I hope he has not suffered the same depressing end as the great conqueror on the larger scale .

		But of course there have been many great heroes beside Hop-along
Cassidy	PERSON	, and everyone has a right to have his own opinion about them , and also -LRB- as we can not well come within possible range -RRB- to state it .

		In fact , it would be foolish to quarrel on the subject , for there are so many different kinds of Wild West novel that there must be a great range of admirers and readers .

		In this long array of gradually shading spe - cies and specimens , Mr.
Spearman	PERSON	's `` Nan of Music Mountain '' stands well along in the upper levels .

		It has most of the convention - alities that it seems impossible to avoid , the dead shot , the horseback girl , the bad man , and others ; but assuming these as one assumes harlequin and columbine in another form of popular literature , one finds something indi - vidual in the story .

		If you try to realize the people and places , you can generally do it , and also find pleasure in so doing .

		Whether it be true to life or not , I should be the last to say , or even to think of the necessity of saying .

		By
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		New edition .

		With introduction by
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Alfred A. Knopf	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a very good story of its kind , which means that it is good in incident , strong on local color , and not without some impressions of character .

		In `` The Phantom Herd , '' Mrs.
B. M. Bowers	PERSON	has an amusing if somewhat eccentric idea .

		Having written many a story of cow - boy life , she now conceives someone who wants to make a moving picture film of the passing or already passed epic of the cow-boy .

		Luck
Lindsay	PERSON	, tired of ordinary Wild West films , peopled the plain in his imagination `` with things that had been but now were no more ; with buffalo and with Indians who camped on the trail of the big herds . ''

		Then `` he saw the coming of the cattle driven up from the south by wind-browned , saddle-weary cow-boys who sung endless chanteys to pass the time as they rode with their herds up the long trail ... What a picture it would all make , '' he thought .

		It may seem curious that anyone who could write of such things absolutely from the life should prefer to present them as they would appear in the distorted mirror of the `` movies '' ; but such was Mrs.
Bowers	PERSON	's preference .

		The chief difficulty in the path of the novel - ist who wishes to realize some of his deeply - felt experiences of this fascinating form of life is that it is hard to get outside the ordi - nary range of stereotyped incident .

		It was unfortunate , therefore , that Mr.
Titus	PERSON	and
Miss Bingham	PERSON	should both at the same time have conceived the personality of the fierce wild horse who is so important in their books .

		I have not heard of the great wild horse since the days of '' The Dog Crusoe , '' and even there he was not so great a horse as either of the two which appears this year .

		Mr.
Titus	PERSON	, beside this main effort , rather relapses into conven - tion in his tale of the young ne'er - do-weel of the East who gives up his vices and makes a man of himself in the bracing air of the
West	LOCATION	.

		One can not say just the same thing of `` The Heart of Thunder Mountain '' ; but there is certainly a familiar air in the central incident of the isolated man with the broken leg , tended through the terrible winter by a devoted girl .

		Originality is not the one great thing in fic - tion , but this much may be said : the writer who nowadays adopts ready-made characters and incidents deliberately gives up by just so much the chance to inform his work with the real impression of life , and makes it thereby just so much the more an ordinary piece of work .

		It will be agreed by most that all such stories , however original and amusing , fall in with a pretty well established literary tradition .

		All sorts of things have been said
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 27 about the Nineties , some of them at the time by
Max Nordau	PERSON	.

		In those early days , in his work on `` Degeneration , '' Mr.
Nordau	PERSON	said that many of those who seemed to be leaders of a new movement were really leaders of nothing at all , but rather expiring stragglers at the end of an exhausted caravan .

		In some matters -LRB- for he spoke of many -RRB- he was doubt - less right , but in one , to which he paid little or no attention , he was wrong .

		In the field ; of fiction the Nineties were a fruitful seed - box , and the crop produced therefrom has been large .

		It was in '91 that `` The Prisoner of Zenda '' was published , which had a large result now almost passed away except for the echoes of the `` movies '' and the `` ten-twenty - thirties . ''

		It was in '90 that `` The Memoirs of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	'' appeared , whence arose a species much more hardy and long-lived .

		It was about the same time in this country that
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	wrote his political novel , `` The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	. ''

		It was toward the end of the decade that '' The Short Line `` War '' by
Messrs Merwin	PERSON	and
Webster	PERSON	showed the possibilities of a romance founded on the achievements of '' big business . ''

		It was but a little later that Mr.
Stewart E. White	PERSON	wrote `` The Blazed Trail , '' which showed the way to so many wanderers in the great wood of romance .

		If one reads the average fiction of the present day one will be pretty sure to find traces of the Zenda story , the political story , the story of big business , the detective story , the story of the great out-doors , either in different novels or all in the same one .

		Careful study may show specimens of these genres before the Nineties , but there can be little doubt that the books just named were the sign if not the cause of a great popu - larization of such and such ideas .

		The general reader cares little for such stud - ies of literary sources , quellen-geschichten the Germans used to call them .

		`` If the book is good , '' one is likely to say , `` what does it matter whether somebody suggested the idea ten years ago ?

		Shakespeare , for one , always used material and ideas that he found in all sorts of places , and never was afraid to write a play like somebody else even if he found it was in fashion . ''

		Yet even for the momentary pleasure , it is a matter of conse - quence whether a book be a more or less fresh creation out of the facts of life or a specimen of a well known and popular line of goods .

		You can see this with half an eye in the detec - tive stories of the day : there are few that are not made on a pattern ; sometimes one strikes a novel element or idea , but generally one has merely a new combination of the quiet intellectualist , the obsequious friend and reporter , the foolish and stupid official inquirer , and the other elements which
Conan Doyle	PERSON	picked up from
Poe	PERSON	.

		And that sort of thing can hardly be even amusing , except to one who has read very little recent litera - ture .

		Nowhere is this more easily seen than in these Wild West stories .

		It was early in these same Nineties that Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	wrote the stories which he afterward welded together with such signal success in `` The Virginian . ''

		In that well-studied and inter - esting book one will find most of the main features that have distinguished the cow-boy story since , the modest and efficient cow - boy , the bad man , the girl from the
East	LOCATION	, with not a few of the scenes and incidents that have suggested so much to the active-minded workers of the years just gone by .

		Some new elements have appeared , as for instance the cow-girl ; and there have been all sorts of combinations , as with the idea of a big busi - ness operation , of a detective mystery , and so on .

		To anyone who has read and can remember , the average cow-boy story is a per - fect patchwork or rag mat of well known material .

		And such things are often inter - esting and attractive ; many a writer of ingenuity and ability will use all kinds of familiar material so as to charm and interest and amuse all sorts of people .

		There is a great deal in having the literary gift or knack or talent ; some people can make a good novel out of anything .

		Still there is a freshness that comes from the touch of life , and this -LRB- to come to the end of a long interjection -RRB- I feel in Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's `` They of the High Trails . ''

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has probably not succeeded in doing in this book all that he had in mind to do , although I may put into definite form ideas which in the author 's mind were but vaguely suggestive and never meant to go farther .

		Xor do I feel that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has wholly avoided the conventional probabilities of such books , perhaps in writing stories of West - ern life one can not wholly avoid the bad man and the murder mystery .

		But in spite of such things one can not read the book without feeling -LRB- as one felt when reading `` The Virginian '' -RRB- that here is a man who has looked long at some of the most interesting phases of life with his own eyes and got his own impressions , who has seen the Western coun - try and really felt its greatness and its rela - tion to our national life , who has the literary gift to fuse all this and turn it out clear-cut and right , a beautiful piece of work .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	is of course of different stock from most of those who write cow-boy stories , 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	older and better stock , I should say : he is of the Nineties himself .

		He is , in fact , of the same group that Mr.
Wister	PERSON	was of when he wrote `` The Virginian , '' the group of those who in those days were absorbed and stimulated by the study of the circumstances and surroundings of place in all parts of the
United States	LOCATION	, and in this case particularly of the
West	LOCATION	.

		I am sure that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	would feel that `` They of the High Trails '' points back to `` Main Travelled Roads '' and not to anything else at all .

		So it does ; it is only in part a story of the cow-boy , it is really a picture of those fringes of frontier that are still left here and there in
Montana	LOCATION	and
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		I at least generally go on with a book more happily when I have received assurance that the writer is giving some first-hand impres - sions from life .

		There are stories of which the great charm is that they are not directly from life , which are the product of the fancy and the ingenuity that sometimes with the artist get their material from life by a very indirect and baffling road .

		But where we have the general idea of the presentation of actual life , I always like to get the assurance that the writer really knows something of the actualities which he is trying to realize for us , that he has taken them in and absorbed them and assimilated them , so that we have something essential as a result and not the obvious only or the accidental , something true to the bottom and not an attractive superfi - ciality , an actual insight into things and not something made up from hearsay and general report .

		And that I usually get from Mr.
Garland	PERSON	: he generally gives one that impres - sion in writing and in speaking .

		He can use the common conventions in such a way that we can see what there is real in them .

		He certainly knows and for years has known the high country of the mountain West , and the people who have passed up into it as the continent was overspread by the veneer of modern civilization .

		He runs them over with a sort of historic responsibility , the grub - staker , the cow-boss , the prospector , the out - law , the remittance-man , and finally the forest ranger , last to appear but perhaps the most deeply to be understood by Mr.
Garland	PERSON	.

		They make to his mind a sort of passing pageant of the last generation on the frontier .

		When the frontier is absolutely gone indeed , they say there is none now his book , like Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's , will keep in mind a passing phase of American civilization better than some more formal histories .

		It will not be a bad thing to read , along with these stories of the high country of our own great West , Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	's `` Green Mansions : A Romance of the Tropical Forest . ''

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	is primarily , I believe , a naturalist , a man of science ; but he has long been known by his books of travel , and by a few romances which have much the same quality .

		That quality I take to be a sort of spiritual sincerity , a sort of devoted render - ing of impressions of nature which go beyond the observation and experience of the scien - tist .

		That , at least , is what I feel in this story of a strange episode in the forests of
South America	LOCATION	.

		The story itself is not new : when one reads of the civilized wanderer exploring wild places and living with wild men , who finds in the depth of the forest a beautiful child of nature , one thinks of
Amyas Leigh	PERSON	and Ayacanora , who must have trod in older days the very same woodlands that lay in the path of Abel and
Rima	LOCATION	.

		But though Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	, like many other writers , conceives of familiar figures , he thinks of them in such a manner as at once to give them the breath of life .

		Not only is the main idea so turned as to express most forcibly the spiritual concep - tion with which he is deeply impressed , but each little incident is such as to give the indis - putable feeling of reality .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, who writes a preface to this new edition of the book , says of him : `` He puts down what he sees and feels , out of sheer love of the thing seen , and the emotion felt . ''

		It may seem curious that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, the ironical observer of our super-civilization , should find the most interesting thing in the literature of our day in the work of Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	, who is essentially a lover and chronicler of nature .

		Perhaps it comes from this same thing in Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	himself , the looking on life for the love of it , and the setting down one 's impression for the sake of a true record .

		We often meet other things in fiction ; but when - ever we meet that , whether in a romance of the tropical forest or in a tale of the northern high country , it is the same thing , and makes us pause a bit and then read more intently .

Hugo Miinsterberg	PERSON	has written a book on `` The Photoplay '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- addressed to the lay - man and well designed to give the latter an appre - ciative understanding of the several physical and psychological principles that enter into the tech - nique of that democratic recreation .

		He proceeds systematically from an account of the
earlier appli	TIME	- cations of the still older principle -LRB- brief expos - ures of changing phases of position which the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 mind combines from the retinal images -RRB- , to the gradual perfection of the projecting apparatus , and the photographic refinements ; then to the psy - chological aspects of the depth and movement , and the play of attention , imagination , and emotion , which constitute the attraction of the `` movies . ''

		The issue of the discussion culminates in the aes - thetic considerations ; the conclusion is set forth with supporting analyses that the photo-play con - stitutes a legitimate art , with its peculiar possibili - ties and demands .

		While subject to - the general laws of aesthetic impression and value , it must not be judged in terms of the other arts exclusively , but it is entitled to an independent appraisal .

		It demands other conditions , is capable of effects to which other visual arts can not attain , and by that token makes a distinctive appeal to the imagina - tion and emotions .

		All this is admirably set forth .

		When the thesis extends to the claim that the popu - lar devices developed conform to extensions of the intrinsic mental movement , giving it a new and precise expression , serious doubts arise .

		The argu - ment becomes rather academic , like a retrogres - sive prophecy : what is , must be .

		The `` close-ups '' follow the same mechanism that brought about the opera-glass ; while the `` cut-backs , '' which picture the reflections of the hero or heroine upon a tender past , represent the play of the reflective imagina - tion of the spectator .

		This may be so ; but the verdict rests with the critical sense of the artist .

		The future may reveal the limitations of the photo - play quite as convincingly as its possibilities ; and the devices which please to-day may be dis - carded by the more mature standards of the decades to come .

		None the less , the `` movies , '' whether they have come to stay or to be forgotten by a jaded and novelty-loving public , have already filled so large a place in the twentieth-century mind that an account of their rationale and their aesthetic justification is a timely contribution .

		A eulogy of Professor
John W. Burgess	PERSON	's lec -
Hayes	PERSON	and hi * tures on `` The Administration of IOH - President
Hayes	PERSON	/ ' delivered last year at
Kenyon College	ORGANIZATION	, are now published in book form -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		After a sketch of the political , economic , and social situation in
1876	DATE	, the legal aspects of the disputed presidential elec - tion of that year are presented in some detail .

		The conclusion is reached that `` no President nor Yice-President had ever had a more complete title legally to his office than did Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	and Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	/ 1 Professor
Burgess	PERSON	is a warm eulogist in recounting the events at the opening of the new administration .

		`` The inaugural address was a model of sound sense , wise statesmanship , genuine patriotism , and cordial good will , expressed in concise , chaste , and elegant language , and pro- nounced with a manly firmness and grace which impressed most favorably and profoundly all those who heard it and all who read it in the public prints . ''

		The eulogy extends to the cabinet chosen by President
Hayes	PERSON	.

		Evarts ,
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, '' had shown himself the most sound and learned constitutional lawyer and the most skilful diploma - tist which the country possessed '' ;
Sherman	PERSON	,
Secre	PERSON	- tary of
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, was `` the soundest man in the nation , next to Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	, himself , on the mone - tary question '' ; and a third member ,
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, is characterized as a `` profound scholar , brilliant orator , brave soldier , wise statesman , independent thinker , great reader , honest man , genial compan - ion , and courteous gentleman . ''

		Professor
Burgess	PERSON	speaks of the remaining cabinet members with somewhat less warmth , yet he concludes : `` Taken altogether , it was the strongest body of men , each best fitted for the place assigned to him , that ever sat around the council table of a President of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The two concluding lectures are given over to an account and defence of the President 's policy toward the Southern states , his financial policy , and his activities in futherance of civil service reform .

		Mention is made of the
Hayes	PERSON	programme during the disturbances along the Mexican border in
1877-9	DATE	, and a comparison is made with the policy of President
Wilson	PERSON	in
1913	DATE	-
15	DATE	.

		The passage in a presidential message of
1880	DATE	calling for an
Isthmian Canal	ORGANIZATION	under American control is quoted , followed by a comparison of
Hayes	PERSON	with another of his successors , in which `` the more impeccable diplomacy '' of
Hayes	ORGANIZATION	is stressed .

		To Professor
Burgess	PERSON	,
Rutherford B. Hayes	PERSON	`` was a political scientist and a statesman . ''

		In his summary of the achievements of the
Hayes	PERSON	administration , Professor
Burgess	PERSON	says that `` every great internal problem the Southern problem , the currency problem , the civil service problem , and the Indian problem had been solved or put upon the right course of solution , the whole coun - try was prosperous and happy , and his party had been restored to power in all branches of the government . ''

		This agrees in the main with a summary written by
Hayes	PERSON	himself in
December of 1881	DATE	, and published recently in Mr ,
C. H. Williams	PERSON	's biography of
Hayes	PERSON	, the two volumes of which the reader will desire to consult for a full treatment of the ninteenth president and his admin - istration .

		Posthumous The late President Little of
Garrett	PERSON	essays of a
Biblical Institute	ORGANIZATION	had no ambition ter > to add to the multitude of printed books , and so his `` Biographical and Literary Studies '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- owe their posthumous appearance to the editorial agency of a friend , the present head of the above-named institution .

		They are lectures , but their preparation for oral deliv - ery was of so scrupulously scholarly a character that they make a most creditable appearance in book-form .

		Like the late
Lord Acton	PERSON	, President Little attached so much importance to careful pre - paratory study , to repeated revision of his work , and to a general habit of open-mindedness and of caution against premature conclusions , that life was far too short to make possible anything but the most meagre expression of his ripened thought in completed form .

		A translation , a
Fernley Lecture	ORGANIZATION	, a book of sermons , and the present vol - ume are all the books that bear his name .

		Eleven lectures make up the contents of the `` Studies , '' and they treat of the apostle
Paul	PERSON	,
Hildebrand	PERSON	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's women ,
Savonarola	LOCATION	, Luther ,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22 Ibsen	DATE	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's women , Ibsen compared with Sophocles and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's place in modern thought .

		In them the deeper realities are searched out and presented in aptly expressive words .

		Near the close of the book , where he asserts of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Sophocles and
Shakespeare	PERSON	that `` the world of fable that served them as a mirror for their time has no reality for us , '' he does rather less than justice to the undying quality of those myths and fables as turned to use by the three masters named .

		A biographical and appre - ciative introduction to the lectures is supplied by President
Stuart	PERSON	, the editor of the book .

		European In '' The Diplomatic Background of diplomacy , the War , 1870-1914 , '' by Professor uro-1914 .


Charles Seymour	PERSON	of
Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , we have another contribution to the literature dealing with the diplomatic history of
Europe	LOCATION	prior to the outbreak of the present war .

		This study ranks with
Headlam	PERSON	's `` History of Twelve Days , ''
Stowell	PERSON	's `` Diplomacy of the War of
1914	DATE	, '' and
Bullard	PERSON	's `` The Diplomacy of the Great War , '' as one of the most scholarly historical studies which the war has produced .

		The present work , how - ever , makes no pretence to being a detailed history of European diplomacy during the forty-five years which elapsed between the Franco-German war of 1870-71 and the outbreak of the present conflict .

		The author essays the more modest task of correlat - ing the important events of recent European inter - national relations , and of pointing out their reaction upon each other ; and , in particular , of indicating how German primacy in continental politics was established by
Bismarck	PERSON	and main - tained by the present Emperor ; how this primacy affected
Great Britain	LOCATION	and led to the creation of the Triple Entente ; how the new alignment of powers was followed by one crisis after another ; and how finally the conflicting ambitions and inter - ests of the great powers led to the present conflict .

		The dominating historical fact between
1870	DATE	and
1914	DATE	was the rise of
Germany	LOCATION	, a circumstance which introduced new elements into the European situation and made the present war inevitable .

		In the face of a common danger ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	threw aside their traditional enmity and formed a combination to preserve the balance of power which the ambitions of
Germany	LOCATION	threatened to upset .

		At the very moment when relations between these three powers were most strained and Anglo-German connections were closest , British policy suddenly underwent an extraordinary transformation , which completely altered the whole European situation .

		Then like a bolt from the blue came the assassination of the Austrian archduke , a crime which , although it horrified the German diplomats , afforded a not unwelcome occasion for entering upon the aggres - sive action which their general policy demanded .

		German hegemony , which had been established by
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	, must be reestablished , and no better pretext for attempting it could be found than that presented by the crime of Serajevo .

		Thus runs Dr.
Seymour	PERSON	's main argument .

		An unbiased ver - dict , he thinks , can hardly be rendered by the pres - ent generation upon the question of the moral justification for
Germany	LOCATION	's uncompromising atti - tude in
1914	DATE	.

		In his view the fact to be remem - bered , however , is that the Germans sincerely believed that they had a right to world empire and , if they were capable of seizing it , to supreme world empire .

		Therefore they were determined `` to give the law to
Europe	LOCATION	in
1914	DATE	either by diplo - macy or by war . ''

		What Christ thought of himself .

		The introduction to Mr.
Anson Phelps Stokes	PERSON	's `` What Jesus Christ Thought of Himself '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- sufficiently indicates the nature of the work . ''

		The fundamental question in Christian theology is not ` What think ye of Christ ? '

		but ` What did Christ think of himself ? '

		The intelligent answer to the former depends largely upon the latter . ''

		It is well to inquire , and to settle if possible , what Jesus thought of himself ; and Mr.
Stokes	PERSON	has succeeded in making an admirably clear and for the most part consistent exposition of this topic .

		But the statement that the view of Jesus , should be the view of his readers is merely a frank announcement of allegiance to the circulus in pro- bando .

		To those already convinced of its con - clusions , the little book will be of much comfort ; but if perchance the author is aiming to appeal to the indifferent , the aim is very much beside the mark .

		He seems to be touched by the higher criti - cism , but not enlightened .

		There are numerous instances of the unfortunate method pursued by many interpreters of the
Bible	LOCATION	, that is , the preser - vation of consistency by adopting now a rigidly literal interpretation , and again a richly imagina - tive or highly fanciful one .

		This method reminds one too vividly of
David Hume	PERSON	's clever custom of speaking , when it suited his purpose , `` with the vulgar . ''

		One example will serve to illustrate the kind of questionable interpretation found through - out : `` In the words of the Apostles ' creed , he was born of one known as ` the
Virgin Mary	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		Whether or not textual criticism justifies the words , `` one known as , '' it appears evident that the author wants to shift responsibility for the
Virgin Maiy	ORGANIZATION	.

		We may have the highest respect for those who accept the
Virgin Mary	PERSON	, with all her assets and liabilities ; but this `` one known as '' indicates too much of the infantile desire to have the cake and eat it too .

		Despite the above , there are many valuable con - structive hints in the volume , and the collation of gospel quotations may be found of great use to students .

		Perilous missionary adventures .

		When
Vancouver	LOCATION	first visited the island now bearing his name the natives regarded his vessel as a great war canoe , and so called it among themselves .

		Missionaries to the descendants of these redskin aborigines may be conceived of as following in the wake of
Vancouver	LOCATION	's war canoe ; and thus Arch - deacon
Collison	PERSON	of Metlakahtla describes his evan - gelizing labors in a book entitled , `` In the Wake of the War Canoe '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , which is further explained to be `` a stirring record of forty years ' successful labour , peril and adventure amongst the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 31 savage Indian tribes of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , and the piratical head-hunting Haidas of the
Queen Charlotte Islands	LOCATION	, B. C. '' Some prefatory words by the Lord Bishop of
Derry	LOCATION	call attention to the more than religious interest of this stirring narra - tive .

		Captain Marry at , he declares , `` never recorded such experience for the delight of school - boys . ''

		Storms at sea , tribal wars on land , earth - quakes and conflagrations , with other disquieting demonstrations from both man and nature , make up the substance of this eventful history , which is written at the urgent request of many friends after an unusually protracted period of what must have been the most fatiguing , most trying sort of missionary labor .

		It deserves a place among the famous records of its kind .

		A map and twenty - four illustrations , with a too-brief index , add to the volume 's interest and usefulness .

		Optimism physioiogi Dr.
George V. X. Dearborn	PERSON	has pre - pared a readable little volume on `` The Influence of Joy '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which sets forth the physiological soundness of an optimistic outlook .

		In the first portion of the book he gives in popular terms the physiological evidence showing the effect of cheer and hopeful expectation upon the functions of nutrition , respiration , and nervous action .

		This field has recently been much enriched by elaborate researches , so that precise facts may now replace more general evidence .

		The conditions under which food is taken are as vital a factor in diges - tion as any other ; appetite is as real chemically as psychologically .

		The psychic factor in adjust - ment is provided for in the nervous system .

		In the broader field , attitude is even more dominant .

		Work and play , enthusiasm and drudgery , are partly determined by attitude .

		Discipline is nec - essary ; but worry is - the great irritant , and despondency the great enemy , of life .

		Adequate function establishes a positive balance in favor of optimism .

		Cheer , humor , laughter , sympathy , love , and the positive forces of the psychic barometer are indispensable .

		Recreation finds its justifica - tion , and the wholesome tone of response is direct efficiency .

		Despite some rather obtrusive manner - isms , Dr.
Dearborn	LOCATION	's presentation moves easily ; and though not deep , it is sound and helpful .

		Modem German ^ seri es of SIX lectures On `` The in the m ^ ri ^ a ny Making of
Modern Germany	LOCATION	, '' deliv - ered last year in
Chicago	LOCATION	by Pro- fessor
Ferdinand Schevill	PERSON	, are now issued in book form by
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lectures touch the salient points of
Germany	LOCATION	's development from the Thirty Years ' War to the present day .

		They are popular in tone , as befits the university extension audiences to whom they were addressed ; but they seem almost too cursory to justify their publication in book form .

		The author , while not discussing the war directly , has a strong pro- German bias , and is at considerable pains to min - imize the Prussianism and militarism of the German Empire and to claim for the German constitution a greater measure of the democratic spirit than most Americans are able to detect .

		It is hardly !

		correct to state , as he has done , that the govern - -LCB- ment of the Empire does not differ in character from the government of a German municipality .

		Both are indeed undemocratic , but the former is i based ultimately on feudalism and the latter on ; business efficiency .

		There is an appendix devoted i to a palliation of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's action in `` editing '' | the
Ems	ORGANIZATION	dispatch , the best answer tt > which would be a reading of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's own cynically frank admissions in chapter 22 of his `` Gedanken und j Erinnerungen . ''

		It is virtually an impossible task > ake such a selection of plays from the whole range of non-Eng - lish literature , extending from _ 5Cschylus to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as shall satisfy everybody ; so that to find fault with Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's `` Chief European Dramatists '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- because the editor does not include this or that drama is really a work of supererogation .

		It is a creditable per - formance to have brought within the pages of a single volume twenty-one plays which are on the whole admirably representative of the main cur - rents of dramatic art through the centuries .

		The volume is intended primarily as a text-book for a general college course in the drama , and as such it might very properly have had a little fuller crit - ical apparatus .

		What there is of such apparatus is contained in three rather scanty appendices .

		The notes on the authors are extremely compressed , and those on the text are just enough to suggest the place of the plays in the development of the drama .

		The reading-list on the dramatists is so meagre as to be practically valueless ; it is not nearly so full as the corresponding list in Pro- fessor
Dickinson	PERSON	's `` Chief Contemporary Drama - tists . ''

		It would have been an easy matter to record some half a dozen standard critical works on each author , if any bibliography was worth while at all .

		full sense of that term , and this fact might well have been established at the outset in Professor
Charles Eugene Boyd	PERSON	's `` Public Libraries and Literary Culture in Ancient
Rome	LOCATION	'' ; but in the early cen - turies of the Empire there were founded more than a score of libraries hospitable to scholars and readers , and to that extent `` public . ''

		Library leg - islation and library commissions and taxation for library purposes were still centuries in the future .

		Nevertheless it appears that the woman librarian , or library assistant of humble rank , was not un - known even in the days of the Caesars .

		A certain
Publius Rubrius Optatus	PERSON	dedicated a monument to his wife , `` Pyrrhe Rubriae Helviae librariae . ''

		This we note in Professor
Boyd	PERSON	's chapter on the man - agement of libraries .

		His book also discusses the history , equipment , contents , object , and cultural significance of the Roman public library , giving particular attention to libraries in
Rome	LOCATION	during
the first century	DATE	and a half of the Empire .

		Scattered references in two-score ancient authors and a few 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 22	DATE	other classical sources , with many modern works on ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, have furnished the fragmentary material from which he has reconstructed for us the old Roman library as it may be supposed to have once existed .

		The book shows laborious scholarship and patient research , with an impres - sive array of classical quotations , chiefly in the form of footnotes .

		Two pages of bibliography and five of index conclude the volume .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` Curiosities in Proverbs '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , classified and arranged by Mr.
Dwight Edwards Marvin	PERSON	, is a collection of unusual adages , maxims , apho - risms , phrases , and other popular dicta from many lands .

		In the
Introduction	ORGANIZATION	, as well as in his annotations , Mr.
Marvin	PERSON	reveals the interest of a zealous student of folklore .

		His industry has brought together more than two thousand folk sayings , translated from more than seventy languages and dialects .

		A useful and timely historical atlas of modern
Europe	LOCATION	, with explanatory text by Messrs.
C. Grant Robertson	PERSON	and
J. G. Bartholomew	PERSON	, has been pub - lished by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are forty-three maps in all , each plate explanatory of the history and evolution of the
State	ORGANIZATION	dealt with prior to
1789	DATE	, with
August 4 , 1914	DATE	, as the termi - nus .

		The accompanying descriptive matter aims to supplement , not to supplant , the historical text - book ; the maps show clear printing and proper subordination of details .

		Dr.
Louis Starr	PERSON	adds another to the many books now available for protecting the adolescent by proper guidance through this difficult period .

		`` The Adolescent Period '' -LRB- Blakiston -RRB- treats the subject considerably in its several aspects , phys - ical , mental , moral .

		The book is primarily a use - ful and simple handbook from the medical point of view .

		It tells the story directly for the benefit of parents and those who have responsibility for the young .

		It is safe and sane , especially on sex matters , and generally full of good counsel ; it is cautious without being alarming , and includes enough of various matters to make a rounded whole .

		There is doubtless place for a volume that describes in simple and intelligible language the present accredited attitude toward the less favored specimens of young humanity .

		For this service , Mr.
Arthur Holmes	PERSON	's book on `` Backward Children '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has good claims .

		It is simple , specific , and concrete .

		It tells directly , in terms of observed cases , of the problems that backward children present , what psychology is doing to determine their causes , and what education is doing to make the best of the situation .

		Beyond this the volume accomplishes little , and makes no pretence to more .

		It is open to the charge of undue simpli - fication , and of being superficial in the desire to be light and intelligible .

		It reflects much reading , but little critical ability .

		For those with modest demands , it promises a profitable service .

		Oral English has been receiving increased atten - tion in schools and colleges ; its more radical adherents now insist that it should be independent both of literature and of written composition .

		It is with this idea in mind that Mr.
John M. Brewer	PERSON	has composed a handbook of `` Oral English '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , in which , as he says , he addresses the stu - dent from the point of view `` of the modern , active man or woman of the world , who must talk a great deal and wishes to do it with businesslike simplicity and brevity . ''

		The first part of the book discusses the various kinds of talk and the manner of speaking , and includes abundant exer - cises ; the second part deals with debating and parliamentary law ; and appendices contain lists of topics for reference , plans for mock trials , and other matters .

		English composition for the second year of the high school is succinctly taught , by example fully as much as by precept , in Mr.
Edwin L. Miller	PERSON	's `` Practical English Composition , Book II '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- .

		As Book I of this series laid emphasis on description , so the present number gives prominence to narration .

		In like manner the two succeeding parts will emphasize exposi - tion and argumentation .

		Journalism receives especial attention throughout this second portion of the set , and the exercises are both oral and written , as in the preceding volume .

		A brief quo - tation begins each chapter , and a poem closes it `` to furnish that stimulus to the will and imagination without which great practical achieve - ment is impossible . ''

		This is well ; but less ready approval is given to the author 's assertion that `` the sort of idealism that has no practical results is a snare . ''

		If this be true , it is not a truth that the present generation needs to have dinned into its ears .

		Practical details of journalism , even to the writing of advertisements , are taught in the book 's twenty chapters by one who has himself had experience of newspaper work .

		The
Folk-Lore Society of Texas	ORGANIZATION	is a branch of the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is organized for the more thorough exploration of the folk-lore of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and has been decidedly active .

		Or - ganized in
1911	DATE	, it has held five annual meetings , at which much interest has been shown and some papers of real merit read .

		The society numbers nearly one hundred members .

		Its field is a rich one because of the fact that
Texas	LOCATION	is a meeting - ground of whites , negroes , Indians , and Mexicans .

		We have just received its first publication , which contains thirteen papers , besides the record of meetings and list of members .

		The papers printed have all been read at annual meetings ; and among them are some , both general and local , of more than ordinary interest .

		The paper upon ``
Texas	LOCATION	Play - Party Songs and Games '' is a veritable con - tribution to our knowledge .

		Of papers dealing with folk-lore in its larger aspects , the two of most importance are `` Folk-lore and its Influence in Determining Institutions '' by Mr.

		THE SPIRIT OF JAPANESE POETRY .

		It is natural that present-day literature in
Japan	LOCATION	should be in a state of transition .

		In this respect it resembles the painting of those Japanese artists who have not yet succeeded in combining their native manner with the widely different characteristics of European or American painters .

		Transition is usually unsatisfactory ; the loss is not yet compen - sated by the gain .

		During the past forty or fifty years , foreign influences have been creep - ing into the literature of
Japan	LOCATION	, till latterly the trickle has become a floodtide .

		At first the alien poetic voices that compelled a listen - ing were those of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and of
Bryant	PERSON	also , whom the Japanese found remarkably to their liking .

		Then followed familiarity with
Browning	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, to speak of English poets only ; while
Byron	PERSON	, who was not one of the earlier forces , has now won a position in
Japan	LOCATION	that he has to some extent forfeited in his own country .

		To get at the genuine native tone , the authentic voice of this people , we must not pay attention to the utterances influenced by these foreigners , which are necessarily largely imitative and alien .

		We have to revert to a period before the coming of foreign influence , just as in understanding the country 's religious ideas we must alike ignore the teachings of Christianity and of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	; we have to return to the old forms , the primitive conventions that confined Japanese poetry of the past .

		We find that the distinctive note of the older day is brevity .

		It abhorred wordiness , it shunned detailed description ; it relied on hint and suggestion and half - spoken allusion .

		Japanese poems of what may be termed the classic ages were dainty triumphs of insinua - tion , tiny miniatures of impression .

		They lacked the sting , the clear-cut finish , of epi - gram ; they were too brief to be termed lyrics ; they nearly always meant more than they said .


Yone Noguchi	PERSON	has referred to the `` words , words , words '' of western writers ; and in so doing he decidedly touches a weak spot , a defect that too often vitiates our lit - erature .

		Some of our greatest writers , we know well , would lose little if half their work was cut away and forgotten ; in some cases they might even gain .

		There was nothing of this negligible accretion in the early Japanese 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	poet ; to our way of thinking he rather said too little than too much .

		From the seventh to the fifteenth century the prevailing form was that known as the
Uta	PERSON	, a verse-mould of five lines only , limited to thirty-one syllables , compared with which our sonnet seems rather a long poem .

		Yet in time even this form seemed too lengthy , too wordy , for the na - tional genius , which craved still closer limits and more arduous exactions ; and to meet the new need the
Hokku	PERSON	form was devised , con - sisting of three lines only and limited to sev - enteen syllables .

		As time passed on , it is easy to see that such a form might become purely mechanical , an artificial craftsmanship , just as the rondeau and the sonnet itself may become mere academic exercises .

		Yet the Japanese had seized hold of a primary artis - tic truth : they knew that the thing suggested must always be greater than the thing ex - pressed if it is to be great at all ; they felt that the very concealments of art may be a revelation . ''

		The very best poems , '' says
Noguchi	PERSON	, '' are left unwritten or sung in silence . ''

		Our highest thought , our deepest feelings , always fail to find their full expres - sion ; therein lies their stimulus and their charm .

		Outward utterance is at best a make - shift , a resort to what is material for the expressing of that which is spiritual .

		In defence of this truth the Japanese went to an extreme , by reason of which their literature has suffered ; because , while it escapes the perils of loquacity , it misses also the highest flights of the lyrical , the spacious majesty of the epic , the rich coloring of mature descrip - tion .

		Their poems are supreme in one direc - tion only , in the sphere of momentary suggestiveness ; they are brief flights of song that have not time to soar high , tiny utter - ances that indicate more than they have opportunity to fulfil .

		We may fairly contend that our own lit - erature has the Japanese merit , and that it has much more .

		When we crave the Japanese style , we make brief excerpts from our poets , cutting out fragments of a few lines for the sake of this very quality of suggestion .

		But in so doing we know that we are not exhaust - ing our resources ; and we turn to the com - plete poems for a still fuller satisfaction .

		We can not always be content with miniatures however exquisite .

		The fragments do well for an odd moment , as something to take into our memories and store there ; bat this kind of thing does not serve for continuous reading .


Japan	LOCATION	has given the world nothing like the classic epics , or the less formal but more popular epics of the Teutons , the
Scandina	LOCATION	- vians , the Slavs .

		It has produced nothing that resembles the ballad-poetry of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, of
Russia	LOCATION	, of
Servia	LOCATION	and
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and nothing like the `` Kalevala '' of the Finns .

		It has nothing to take the place of the
Arthu	PERSON	- rian song-cycles and the Gaelic folk-tales .

		But it must not be supposed that there are no long poems in Japanese literature .

		There is an ancient form known as the Naga-uta , unlimited in length , though even this rarely extended beyond thirty or forty lines .

		There is also an elaborately developed national drama , deriving from religious observances and employing a chorus very much after the fashion of the Greek .

		But we are dealing here with poetry , not dramatic production ; and in poetry we must consider the Uta and the
Hokku	PERSON	as the two distinctive Japanese modes of expression in days before racial con - servatism had yielded to foreign influence .

		From a study of these tiny compositions we infer that the national temperament has not run to the deepest emotions of poetic feeling or at least of poetic passion : we find tender sentiment , graceful allusion , vivid natural touches , but not often the philosophy , the criticism of life , the thought `` too deep for tears , '' which belong to our conceptions of the poetic .

		Poetry seems to have been left chiefly to the delicate sentimentalist , the sen - sitive craftsman in words , the dilettante .

		Buddhism and Chinese learning absorbed the more powerful minds of
Japan	LOCATION	; novel writ - ing and the drama claimed others .

		Poetry was an alluring byway rather than the broad road of national thought and ideal .

		But in their kind some of these miniatures are per - fect .

		It must be remembered that many of these lovely swallow-flights of song were pro- duced at a time when
Europe	LOCATION	was distracted and defaced by such barbaric strife as that of which we are now seeing an unhappy relapse .

		European poetry of the sixth and seventh centuries is absolutely archaic in tone ; but there is nothing archaic , nothing ancient , in the note of such an utterance as the follow - ing Via : When I have gone away , Though my dwelling-house should be Without its master , Plum-tree beside the eaves , Do not forget the
Spring	DATE	.

		The tone of regret , the '' pathetic fallacy '' of an appeal to the tree , are as fresh in this as in
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Here is another that is quite mod - ern in its fancy : The sky is a sea Where the cloud-billows rise , And the moon is a bark ; It is oaring its way To the groves of the stars .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 45 So far as its idea and expression go , this might have been written only yesterday .

		In English we have many cuckoo-songs , usually joyful ; in
Japan	LOCATION	the bird 's note , slightly differing from the cuckoo of
Europe	LOCATION	, is sug - gestive of melancholy and longing : I would go to some land Where no cuckoos are ; I am so sorrowful When I hear their note .

		We think of
Burns	PERSON	's appeal to the woodlark , For pity 's sake , sweet bird , nae mair , Or my poor heart is broken I But
Burns	PERSON	says more than does the Japanese poet ; his sorrow is more outspoken .

		In these poems we must always seek for that which is not actually expressed ; certainly we must do so with the following , which evidently indi - cates a love-tryst : On the
Spring	DATE	moor I went forth To gather violets ; Its charm so held me That I stayed till morn .

		The next example belongs to a century or so later ; it has all the quiet sadness that we re - gard as a modern note in our own literature : What is it that makes me feel so desolate This evening while I wait For one who comes not ?

		Can it be the breathing of the autumn wind ?

		Passing from the conciseness of the Uta to the still closer limits of the
Hokku	LOCATION	, we have such gems as the following , of course losing much in the veil of translation from a lan - guage whose nature is utterly different from our own : Thought I , the fallen flowers Are returning to their stems ; But lo , they were butterflies !

		As better illustrating the differences of lan - guage and the utter impossibility of adequate translation , here is the original of a most admired Hoklcu : Asagawo ni Tsurube torarete Morai mizu .

		^ Literally rendered , this is : The well-bucket taken away By the morning-glory Alas , water to beg I `` We may well try to extract its definite mean - ing and feel dissatisfied .

		To fit it for western ears and understandings , Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	has translated it in seven lines : The morning-glory Her leaves and bells has bound My bucket-handle round .

		I could not break the bands Of these soft hands .

		The bucket and the well to her I left ; `` Let me some water for I come bereft . ''

		We feel at once that this is a clumsy and unsatisfying version .

		Far better is the ren - dering by Miss
Clara Walsh	PERSON	: All round the rope a morning-glory clings ; How can I break its beauty 's dainty spell ?

		I beg for water from a neighbor 's well .

		But the English has to express what the Japanese merely suggests .

		It takes thirty syllables to do what the original does in fif - teen ; and Tone
Noguchi	PERSON	tells us that the lit - eral translation is really far the most satis - factory .

		Here is another specimen , beautiful when we guess its significance : The hunter of dragonflies Today how far away May he have gone !

		It is a mother 's lament for her dead boy .

		One more example , highly prized by the Japanese during many centuries , is this of the tired traveller reaching his inn , and sud - denly charmed from his weariness or per - haps touched by some emotion of remem - brance at sight of the clustering wistarias : I come weary In search of an inn Ah , those wistaria flo ` wers !

		What writer in English would be content with that ?

		And yet how complete its suggestion !

		Perhaps nothing can better illustrate the charm of these short utterances .

		How lightly they touch a chord and then quit it , how they move us to quick transitory emotion like that caused by the perfume of a flower or a few twittered bird-notes !

		All the sensibility of the Japanese nature is held within them ; it is not paraded or emphasized , but merely hinted at , almost diffidently and always grace - fully .

		But we feel that the full character of the people is not thus expressed , only tran - sient moods , fleeting emotions of desire or memory .

		It is not thus that a nation can adequately embody its ideals , its ambitions , and its thoughts .


ARTHUR L. SALMON	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A REVIVAL OF LEISURE FOR LITERATURE has , according to the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' been one of the results of the war so far as
England	LOCATION	is con - cerned , at least .

		In a surprisingly cheerful and optimistic discussion , the
English Association	ORGANIZATION	some weeks ago persuaded itself that the present fearful conflict had promoted the cause of good literature and turned the minds of men to serious books , especially to lofty poetry and the profundities of philosophic history and much of that older and worthier literature that the piping times of peace 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	had caused the people to pass over in careless neglect .

		Commenting on all this , the `` Times '' finds four causes for the present alleged return to soberer ways .

		First , modern war is a slow and monotonous business , and the soldier has more time and more inclination for reading than ever before in all his life .

		Secondly , the modern army is very different from the old regular army : it is made up largely of men not unused to books and reading .

		Thirdly , the thousands of convalescents in military hospitals are calling for books to occupy their enforced leisure .

		And fourthly , the civilian population at home `` have had much more money to spend than before and fewer ways of spending it .

		There were no longer any cheap tickets to tempt people to travel , and the dark streets made them disinclined to venture out again after they had once found their way home .

		The result was that the new quietness of the evenings and the Sundays provided a harvest for the booksellers . ''

		Thus , if these quoted observations are trustworthy , a time of unprecedented stress and strain has pro- duced a revival of leisure for literature , and even - the long-neglected Greek and Latin classics have shared in the benefits of this revival , the excellent
Loeb	PERSON	edition of these old authors being in especial demand at present .

		Best of all , if it be not too good to be true , all signs point , to this optimistic observer , toward a post-bellum continuance of this admirable state of things in the world of books and reading .

		THE DEMOCRATIC NOTE AT THE
A. L. A. CONFER	PERSON	- ENCE this year was struck more than once .

		In fact , one might call it the dominant note , so far as there was such a note , in the symphony of address and lecture and discussion enjoyed by the thousand or more library workers and library well - wishers assembled at
Asbury Park	LOCATION	in the
last week of June	DATE	.

		On the programme were a number of papers dealing with some phase of democracy in its relation to literature or education or the dis - tinctive work of the library , as , for instance , that by Mr.
Robert Gilbert Welsh	PERSON	on `` Democracy in the Modern Drama , '' and that by Miss
Jessie B. Rittenhouse	PERSON	on `` The New Poetry as an Expression of Democracy , '' and that also by Miss
Mary Ogden White	PERSON	on `` Democracy in Modern Fiction , '' and , finally , that by Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	on `` How Democracy Educates Itself . ''

		Discussion , too , of `` The Circulation Department in its Relation with the Public '' was not without its democratic sug - gestions and implications ; and the people 's wel - fare came under consideration , as a matter of course , in Mr.
Samuel H. Ranck	PERSON	's observations on `` Ventilation and Heating of Library Buildings . ''

		Furthermore , to the large party visiting Prince - ton in the interval between two sessions of the convention , President
Hibben	PERSON	addressed some remarks emphasizing the democratic character of the public library .

		Especially well said was the following : `` At this time , when the whole world seems to be rushing on into an unknown future , you are holding fast to the great articles of the past .

		You are guarding the sources of knowledge .

		The library is to-day the only absolutely demo - cratic institution that man possesses .

		If those things of the past did not matter we would close the doors of our libraries .

		If we would go for - ward we must take the past with us . ''

		That thus , throughout , the democratic note should have been sounded in the deliberations of those gathered in the interest of `` the one absolutely democratic institution that man possesses '' -LRB- possibly a slight exaggeration , but let it stand -RRB- calls for no other than approving comment .

		THE HAUNTING LINE exerts upon the imagina - tion a power that will never be explained any more than life itself , poetry , reality , charm , eter - nity , or any other of the great mysteries .

		It is in early life , before the analytic and reasoning fac - ulty has developed , that the chance phrase or the musical combination of words or syllables is most likely to arrest the attention and fix itself lastingly in the memory ; and , curiously enough , or nat - urally enough , the less clearly the words are under - stood and the vaguer the image they convey , the greater and more enduring the charm .

		It may be so simple a phrase as `` locusts and wild honey , '' full of strange possibilities to the child 's palate , that persists in haunting the mind ; or perhaps he has chanced to hear the couplet from Prior , A Eeehabite poor Will must live , And drink of
Adam	PERSON	's ale , and in unquestioning ignorance of the meaning of `` Adam 's ale , '' still more of `` Rechabite , '' he delights in repeating to himself the mysterious lines , with their rich potentialities of meaning .

		To be told that
Adam	PERSON	's ale is nothing but water would have something of shock and cruel disillusion for the imaginative mind ; and to have it explained that a Rechabite is a descendant of
Jonadab	LOCATION	, the son of Rechab , would be a weariness of the flesh .

		The line , `` At midnight in his guarded tent , '' has in it delightful shudders and thrilling anticipa - tions , if one hears it for the first time in tender years .

		These reminiscent reflections are in part prompted by a short article on `` The Singing Phrase , '' in the closing pages of the
July	DATE	`` Scribner , '' which will doubtless move many others to similar recollection of lines and phrases and single words that have meant more to them than they ever could explain to others .

		THE MOST PROLIFIC OF WRITERS FOR BOYS , with the possible exception of some three or four pen - men in the employ of dime-novel and nickel-novel publishing houses , would probably be found , on investigation , to be the late
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	, who died
June 20	DATE	, in his seventy-seventh year , with so many books to his credit that he professed himself unable to state their number .

		A publisher 's announcement of a forthcoming new edition of Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's `` renowned books for boys , comprising eighty-five titles , '' does not , it is safe to say , exaggerate the youngsters ' indebtedness to the author of the almost innumerable series -LRB- the `` Log Cabin , '' `` Deerfoot , '' `` Through-on-Time , '' `` Bound to Win , '' `` Forest and Prairie , '' etc. -RRB- that have held the breathless attention of tens of thousands
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 47 of boy readers .

		His facility and fertility were such as to make it inexpedient , from the pub -
Usher	DATE	's viewpoint , that his rapid succession of stories should all bear his own name as author ; hence the variety of pen-names -LRB- Col.
H. R. Gordon	PERSON	.

		Lieut.
R. H. Jayne	PERSON	, and others -RRB- that have tended to make appear less voluminous than it really is the product of his inexhaustible invention as a romancer for the young .

		His inspiration for this work was gained very largely , he was wont to declare , in the classroom , where he varied the tedium of recitation by telling stories to his pupils ; and this experience may well have sharpened his keenness for the things that most unfailingly interest youthful readers .

		BOOKS THAT KNOW NO SUMMER VACATION , and no vacation at any season , are the books that
Colonel Roosevelt	PERSON	must have had in mind when , in `` A Book-Lover 's Holidays in the Open , '' he advised vacationers to choose for reading `` the same books one would read at home . ''

		Although it is known to machinists and physicists that even an inanimate mechanism needs a rest once in so often that a razor or a locomotive or an automo - bile suffers from protracted and uninterrupted service to an extent out of proportion to the actual work performed it is not known that a book undergoes any deterioration as to its contents by however long and uninterrupted a term of service in the hands of readers .

		Hence the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' does well to urge the continu - ous use of the library 's store of literature through all seasons of the year .

		The librarian himself -LRB- and herself -RRB- needs a
summer	DATE	vacation , and deserves one , but `` an idle book represents idle capital , than which nothing short of destruction is more wasteful .

		Librarians sometimes complain that people will not read in
summer	DATE	.

		This is only in part true .

		Though they may read less , though they may read lighter literature , and though they may not come so often to the library , nevertheless people do read during the
summer	DATE	months .

		As the vacation season approaches it becomes well worth - while to consider ways and means of keeping the books off the library shelves .

		Waive rules , break rules , or make new rules , but keep your books in the hands of those who will make use of them during the
summer	DATE	months . ''

		The late Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	used to consider the
summer	DATE	vacation his best time for solid reading , and on leaving home for
Bar Harbor	LOCATION	in
June	DATE	he was in the habit of ordering a generous supply of substantial litera - ture from the
Philadelphia Library	LOCATION	, of which , by the way , he was for many years a director , so that he enjoyed a practically unlimited freedom in availing himself of its resources for vacation use .

		A PHILIPPINE MOVE FOR EFFICIENCY -LRB- a word not without its odious associations -RRB- is reported in the latest `` Bulletin '' to reach us from the
Philip	LOCATION	- pine Library .

		The movement is officially described in the wording of a legislative act passed in
February	DATE	by the law-making body of the islands , and entitled `` An Act to authorize , in the interest of the efficiency and uniformity of the public service , the consolidation of the Philippine Library ,
the Division of Archives	ORGANIZATION	, Patents , Copyrights , and Trade-Marks of the
Executive Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, and the Law and
Library Division	ORGANIZATION	of the
Philippine Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, to form an organization to be known as ` Philippine Library and Museum , ' under the administrative control of the Secretary of Public Instruction . ''

		Nine sections elaborate the details of this act , but no reader will quarrel with us for refraining from even the briefest quotation .

		Rather would we quote , if space permitted , some paragraphs from Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	's '' ` Twixt Library and Museum , '' in this month 's `` Public Libraries . ''

		The functions of the two tend to overlap each other , but whether their combined usefulness may be increased by consolidation is still within the region of debate .

		THEY WHO HAVE FOUND THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH in the vocation of letters can well afford to smile at the fatuous undertaking seriously entered upon , with the highest sanction , four centuries ago by the adventurous
Ponce de Leon	ORGANIZATION	.

		An editorial note in this month 's `` Century '' calls attention to the eminent authors , old in years but young in heart , whose pens are still active .

		Among these , not all of them authors exclusively or even primarily , are Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, close upon eighty , whose current serial story shows him to be still inferior to none in vigor of style combined with nimbleness of wit and an unfailing quality of humor ; Mrs.
Amelia Barr	PERSON	, more than half-way between eighty and ninety , with three-score novels to her credit , and still writing ; Mr.
John	PERSON	,
Burroughs	LOCATION	, a near-octo - genarian and not yet past his prime -LRB- as readers of `` Under the Apple-Trees '' will agree -RRB- ; ex - President
Eliot	PERSON	, vigorous and productive at eighty - two ;
Colonel Watterson	PERSON	, `` a very
Ty Cobb	PERSON	of editorial writers , '' as `` The Century '' calls him ; Mr.
Henry Mills Alden	PERSON	, almost coeval with the occupant of the `` Easy Chair , '' and still one of the most alert of editors ; and , to conclude as briefly as possible , Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	of `` The Outlook , '' Mr.
William Hayes Ward	PERSON	of `` The Independent , '' Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	.

		Truly the fountain that eluded the Spanish explorer must be the fountain - pen which , with many , of course , translates itself into the typewriter .

		Ink , at any rate , is the reju - venating liquid vainly sought by
Ponce de Leon	ORGANIZATION	.

		SIDELIGHTS ON THE STORY HOUR may or may not be really illuminative .

		Between those who exalt its actual and potential accomplishment of good , and those who belittle and even ridicule its part in library activity , the observer is often per - plexed to know what to think of this systematic and determined attempt to take the youngsters by the hand and lead them through the winding lanes and stately avenues of the Land of Make - Believe .

		If story-telling arouses such interest in any given community as not only to gather crowded audiences when no admission fee is charged , but also to pack the house at a stated THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	price per seat , then story-telling must be a success in that place .

		Let the following from the
Toronto Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's current Report tell its own story in regard to story-telling : `` The work with the children , which showed such a remarkable increase last year , has shown even greater results , and we see new possibilities for the coming year .

		This department is decidedly aggressive in its methods , and no phase of public social service in this city has awakened such wide interest .

		The Story Hour , already popular , was given a decided help onwards by the series of lectures which the Children 's Librarian arranged for during
October	DATE	and
Novem	DATE	- ber , when Miss
Marie Shedlock	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	,
Eng.	LOCATION	, spoke to five delighted audiences on ` Story Tell - ing . '

		Through the kindness of
Victoria College	ORGANIZATION	we were given the use of the Chapel and all seats were sold out a week prior to the first lecture .

		But we are not told what proportion , if any , of these five delighted audiences was composed of juvenile listeners , or whether indeed Miss
Shedlock	PERSON	told any stories or merely told how to tell them .

		On the latter assumption , however , by what magic did she hold the attention of these entranced hearers to the exposition of this branch of library work ?

		... A NEW LYRIC FROM SAPPHO 'S PEN , Or stylus , Or whatever writing implement the poetess of Mytilene chose to use , ought to arrest attention even in these frenzied times .

Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's verse discovered within two years has been deciphered and restored from the time-worn papyrus by Mr.

Cambridge	LOCATION	, who thus translates it into beautiful prose : `` Make stand beside me in a dream , great

		At first when they put forth hither from
Scamander	LOCATION	's swift flood , they could not win home , but ere that could be , were fain to make prayer to thee and to mighty Zeus and to
Thyone	ORGANIZATION	's lovely child .

		So now pray I , Lady , that of thy grace I may do again , as of old , things pure and beau - tiful among the maids of Mytilene , whom I have so often taught to dance and sing upon thy days of festival ; and even as Atreus ' seed by grace of thee and thy fellow-gods did put out then from

		A MAMMOTH WAR LIBRARY , one of the by-prod - ucts of the great European conflict , has been amassed by

		Publishers ' trade lists show that , active as have been the presses in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	in turning out war literature , the printers beyond the Rhine have been even busier .

		Publications dealing with the war from the German viewpoint are believed to equal in number the combined English and French product of a similar sort from an opposite point of view .

		At the end of
last September	DATE	such German works were estimated , or perhaps counted , by an English investigator , who gave their total as 6,395 , including maps , economic and legal dissertations , and even imagina - tive writings inspired by the war .

		At the present time this total has been raised to probably eight thousand or more , and is still growing .

		Is it r after all , a collection worthy of a special building , or is it rather a mass of printed evidence to be more and more ashamed of as time passes , inter - national animosities subside , and enlightenment increases ?

		... AN TJNWORKED MINE OF WEALTH for writers and producers of plays seems now about to be made productive to its utmost capability .

		... THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERSE AND PROSE IS briefly and clearly explained in Sir
Arthur Quiller	PERSON	-
Couch	ORGANIZATION	's late collected lectures on `` The Art of Writing . ''

		Discreetly avoiding `` the term poetry , over which the critics have waged , and still are waging , a war that promises to be endless , '' the lecturer shows no hesitation in defining verse as `` memorable speech set down in metre with strict rhythms , '' whereas `` prose is memorable speech set down without constraint of metre and in rhythms both lax and various . ''

		In passing , it will be noted how admirably -LRB- except perhaps for the word `` memorable '' -RRB- this definition of prose applies to the `` free verse '' which the preced - ing definition would coldly thrust out into the region of prose .

		After all is said that can be said on the peculiar quality that makes poetry or verse something different from prose , what better def - inition of poetry have we than that old one of
Stedman	PERSON	's ?

		He says , with first place given to the importance of rhythm , that `` poetry is rhyth - mical , imaginative language , expressing the inven - tion , taste , thought , passion , and insight of the human soul . ''

1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 I know not what you call all ; but if I fought not with fifty of them , I am a bunch of radish . ''

		The substitution of `` the whole British fleet '' for `` fifty of them , '' with the addition of a cartoon repre - senting a certain European monarch wearing an upturned moustache and flourishing a sword , makes the application plain .

		Side by side with this might be placed the poetic effusion ascribed to the German admiral whose late exploit off the coast of
Jutland	LOCATION	led to the supposed utterance above quoted .

		These lines , marked with the right - eous severity we all like to display toward our own pet failings when observed in others , or thought to be so observed , run as follows : Die

		But it will not be quite so novel as the press reports would have us believe .

		Already at

		WHAT IS A NOVEL !

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the symposium recently reported by `` The
Bookman	PERSON	, '' the attempt to answer the somewhat baffling question , `` What is a novel ? ''

		seems to me to leave the question more baffling than ever before .

		To our already inconsistent and unconvincing ideas of what a novel is , or may be , we now have added a large accretion of new and even more incon - sistent ideas , which are certainly not less confusing by reason of the fact that they come from novelists themselves , and may therefore be supposed to be weighted with the sacrosanct dignity that belongs to an ex cathedra utterance .

		It may be that in the midst of these contradictions the mere scientific observer , who has never written , and can not write , a work of fiction , is able to detect the genus novel more clearly than the devotees of the art .

		The worshipper at a shrine can rarely judge the quality of his own religious doctrine ; poets are notoriously bad critics of poetry ; and everyone knows that the best theories of how to raise chil - dren have been written by bachelors .

		Such per - sons are free alike from the personal equation and from the distractions of actual productive artistic labor .

		They are mere observers , and as such are disinterested .

		The old objection to the critic , that he is usually unable to practice the art he criti - cizes , is inherently a foolish objection .

		The man who produces in an art is usually disqualified for criticizing , and vice versa .

		The artist needs one personal style ; the critic must understand all styles .

		The artist must consider his creation for the time the supreme and central achievement of the world ; the critic sees at the same moment all the similar achievements , and compares them .

		What , then , to the scientific and impersonal critic , is a novel ?

		To this question I venture to offer the answer of a mere observer , who has never written a novel , and could not write one .

		But first we may be permitted to rephrase the ques : tion , and ask : What is a good novelt Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's definition , `` A good story well told , '' is of no use .

		For what is `` a good story well told '' ?

		It is one of our ordinary novels .

		So there we are , exactly where we started .

		In the first place , then , a novel is essentially a story with a plot .

		A mere chronicle is not a novel .

		Even ``
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and `` Jean-Christophe '' have plots of a sort , tenuous as they are .

		What , then , is plot ?

		Here is the definition I suggest : Any plot is a state of unstable equilibrium in the lives of the characters , which state can not persist but must progress at once to a solution .

		This is any plot .

		A good plot is such a state which is inter - esting .

		There are some valuable analogies in the natural sciences .

		Take two such harmless substances as , say , oxygen and carbon .

		They are perfectly stable , and may remain so for untold a3ons .

		But bring them together and apply a light ; there is then , if I may be pardoned the phrase , `` something doing . ''

		And it keeps on `` doing '' until the chemical com - bination is complete , and everything is in a state of rest that is , in a state of stability once more .

		Is not this exactly analogous to the love story ?

		Bring two souls into contact ; there is emotional disturbance , which is obliged to produce some other outward disturbance until stability is restored by the union of souls , or by their perma - nent and stable separation .

		This analogue can be paralleled by almost any story that deals with the clash of motives or the disturbance of senti - ments among men .

		Such a story may be a tale of hate or revenge , as well as of love .

		For the story of adventure , also , an analogue in the natural sciences may be found .

		Lift a ball from the table and hurl it violently through space .

		It is brought into a state of unstable equilibrium , 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	and many things may happen before it comes to rest .

		Is this not , in a way , parallel with the famil - iar story of the young adventurer suddenly brought by a series of accidents into the company of a crew of pirates in the south seas .

		The tale does not turn upon conventional relationships between men , but largely upon physical accidents .

		If we accept this definition of a story , we obtain with it a good definition of the term `` solution '' or denouement as applied to a story .

		The `` solu - tion '' is the readjustment to the new conditions , which restores to the disturbed lives a state of stable equilibrium .

		That means that stable equi - librium is restored so far as these events are con - cerned .

		If there are subsequent emotional or other disturbances , they constitute other and dis - tinct stories .

		This necessity for restoring equilibrium in life explains why it is so difficult to end a story .

		Human emotions rarely terminate dramatically , except in the case of death .

		And the death of one or more characters as the solution of a plot has become a bit worn out as a literary device .

		In old-fashioned fiction there was a myth to the effect that love affairs at least among Anglo-Saxons end with the acceptance of the gentleman 's proposals .

		And most love stories blandly broke off there , without even a suspicion of the fact that that particular sort of emotion might harrow or amuse the world for a good many years more before finally coming to rest .

		To-day we are sus - picious of the love story that ends in that fashion .

		It is too pat , too conventional , to be true .

		The business story may have a good natural ending .

		When , for example , Mr.
Wallingford	PERSON	has for the hundredth time got rich quick , his adven - ture ends with the banking of his profits and the boarding of the first train out of town .

		For him that story is definitely finished .

		In most human developments , however , there is no such definite termination .

		Emotions die out by imperceptible changes , more worldly complications solve themselves little by little without dramatic points .

		The lady does not settle things once for all when she falls into the ecstatic lover 's arms .

		The hero who is hard up for money does not invar - iably have an uncle in
India	LOCATION	who dies and leaves him a fortune at the end of the second hundred thousand words ; nor is the lost will discovered in the nick of time ; nor does the hitherto unknown identity of the hero which was concealed when the wicked nurse mixed up the babies suddenly come to light to provide him with fortune , the opportunity to marry his lady love , and possibly to acquire a title .

		In real life , difficulties or complications , whether they be emotional or worldly , dissolve slowly .

		One day we are worried , perhaps desperately worried .

		Six months later we suddenly realize that we no longer care .

		We have forgotten the lady from whom the novelist would have kept us cruelly separated , our business troubles have disappeared , the bills have all been paid , the plans that seemed determined never to work are working like well - oiled machinery ; and yet for the life of us we can not quite tell when , how , or where these things happened .

		In the meantime , being human and restless , we have probably got ourselves into fresh difficulties or fresh complications , which make fresh stories , that are neither part of the old story nor wholly distinct from it .

		And so life swings on through its series of interlocking short-stories , the only real terminus being the last .

		And that , after all , is not the end , since the first questions at our respective deaths will probably look to the future , and have to do with how much money we left , and what will become of the family , all of which , of course , begins another interlocking story .

		Thackeray once carried a novel over parts of four generations .

		The modern novelist is more frank , and simply breaks off at some convenient climax , without really considering whether it be the true end of his story or not .

		Nevertheless I maintain , in spite of these objec - tions , that plots in life do have terminations of a sort .

		There is no grand chorus just before the curtain goes down .

		But there are terminations .

		Therefore plots have solutions .

		And therefore our definition of a good plot is valid , which means that our definition of a good novel is valid .

		`` MACBETH '' NOVELIZED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An amused friend has just sent me a sort of `` novelized '' Macbeth , not a straightforward tell - ing of the mighty story , as
Charles	PERSON	and `` Bridget '' retold the tales , but the sort of thing which might perhaps be called ambitious , were it not that it fell -LRB- of course -RRB- sadly short of all association and literary fact .

		One wonders that a year which should be held properly sacred to the tradition and recollections of Will of
Stratford	LOCATION	should be used as vehicle for this kind of thing .

		Some years ago I remember receiving for review an attempt to improve upon `` Paradise Lost , '' by a conscientious gentleman with the suggestive name of Mull .

		He as good as said in a naive preface that those mighty organ tones were sound - ing unheard above the heads of unpoetic world - lings , so he had thought to rewrite it all down to us .

		Which he did , in noticeably unmelodious prose .

		We all know the short-cut-to-knowledge bene - factor of the race who discovered that Chaucer , though he might be a great poet , clearly did n't know how to spell .

		It was he who begot the mod - ernized rehash , abbreviated and expurgated , of the tales good
Geoffrey	PERSON	told .

		After this came con - densed versions of the Waverley novels , cut into lengths convenient to the casual reading of the tired business man , and any number of other curtailments and abridgments and what not else , running all the way , in point of mere time , from the song of Roland to
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's colorful `` Rise of the Dutch Republic . ''

		ON BEGGING THE QUESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At a local club meeting the other night a number of short papers were read on various aspects of the great phenomenon we call
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the discussions , by a scholar in the field of Biblical literature , undertook to present the now trite and somewhat boresome view that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was a rake , a drunkard , and a lewd , coarse fellow with merely a bit of `` imagination '' which enabled him to dash off such little things as
Portia	LOCATION	's Plea for Mercy ,
Henry Fourth	ORGANIZATION	's apostrophe to
England	LOCATION	, or
Wolsey	ORGANIZATION	's Farewell to Greatness .

		All the posi - tive evidence , asserted the reader , was to this conclusion .

		There were `` traditions '' of his drink - ing , of an illegitimate son , of this , that , and the other -LRB- being a Biblical exegete , he was sweet on traditions -RRB- ; while there were no traditions to the positive virtues of the man , except our foolish and unfounded sentiment , as he termed it .

		He had evidently got his information about Shakespeare from concordances and encyclopaedias and Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	; so he was unaware of the psycholog - ically sound , and historically affirmed , principle that `` the evil that men do '' or do not , `` lives after them '' while the good is usually `` interred with their bones . ''

		This person announced with some glee that we could not prove that
Shakespeare	PERSON	had not died of excesses at the early age of fifty - two ; therefore the probability was that he did .

		I asked him if this was his common principle of historical crit - icism , to accept every scandalous story as true until it was proved false .

		And now , sir , comes the point of my letter .

		He answered with every appearance of triumph that I had resorted to a question-begging epithet , the epithet of `` scandal - ous , '' and was therefore out of court .

		On several others of the company this cant phrase , `` question - begging , '' acted as a wire to a marionette .

		They had learned in a course in Argumentation that uncomplimentary adjectives `` beg the question . ''

		This terror of the epithet has become such a com - mon fetish that I venture a protest to you on the subject .

		What is it to beg the question to assume as a premise the conclusion aimed at ?

		Did I in my simple question , '' Are we to accept every scandal - ous story as true until it is proved false * '' beg the question ?

		Not if the dictionary is to serve any useful purpose .

		The
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	defines `` scandal '' as follows : `` reproachful aspersion ; defamatory speech or report ; something uttered which is injurious to reputation ; defamatory talk ;
mali	LOCATION	- cious gossip . ''

		`` Scandalous '' itself is defined as either -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` exciting reproach or reprobation , '' or -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` opprobrious , disgraceful to reputation , '' : or -LRB- 3 -RRB- `` defamatory . ''

		I submit to you , sir , and to the readers of THE DIAL , that if the dictionary means anything to persons of education , the use I made of the word `` scandalous '' can not beg any question .

		There is not a hint in any one of the definitions given -LRB- nor in the
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	either -RRB- that scandal is regarded as either true or false .

		A scandal is a story injurious to reputation , which evidence may prove true or may prove false .

		If one assumes that it is a true story or that it is a false story , then he begs the question .

		I pointed this out to my opponent , but the dictionary means nothing to one who can win a decision , sat - isfactorily to himself at least , by calling your language illogical .

		Are we to be bullied into giving up effective English words because there are per - sons who decline to understand them ?

		UNIONIZED AUTHORSHIP .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I will ask the courtesy of your columns for a few words in regard to the proposed affiliation of the Authors ' League of
America	LOCATION	with the Amer - ican
Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		It happens that I have had some personal experi - ence in an affair of this sort , having been a mem - ber of the Butte Local of the
Newswriters Union	ORGANIZATION	, holding a charter from the
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the time the Butte Local was formed , salaries ranged from
$ 20.00	MONEY	to
$ 50.00	MONEY	per week for reporters on daily papers .

		By a ruling of
the Union	ORGANIZATION	, a minimum wage of
$ 27.50	MONEY	for evening newspaper reporters and
$ 30.00	MONEY	for morning news - paper reporters was established .

		One apprentice was allowed each office at
$ 15.00	MONEY	per week .

		No reporter could join the
Union	LOCATION	unless he had been actively engaged in daily newspaper work for a period of three years .

		Thus a man who had worked for two years and who might be worth
$ 30.00	MONEY	a week , must either work for
$ 15.00	MONEY	as an apprentice -LRB- should there be a vacancy -RRB- or not work at all .

		The Union had no sooner been formed than all salaries were reduced to the minimum scale .

		It was never necessary for the Newswriters to call upon the
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	for help in any form , but the
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	assessed the Newswriters for printers ' strikes in various parts of the country .

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	There were , at that time , thirteen locals or `` chapels '' of Newswriters organized under char - ter from the
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		I do not believe there are so many to-day .

		Reporters and editorial workers soon found that under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	they had everything to lose and nothing to gain , and that manual labor in the composing room was better paid under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	scale than brain work .

		A union of authors magazine and book authors , if such a thing were possible , would be even less advantageous to the individual writer .

		Since authors do not , as a rule , work upon salary , the only possible result would be a limitation of the writer 's income and a curtailment of his lib - erty .

		No man could write his opinion upon public questions if he did not hold a Union card .

		The periodical press would be most effectively muzzled .

		But what is of more importance to the Authors ' League of
America	LOCATION	because it is a more immi - nent danger is the fact that an affiliation of this kind would most probably result in the disor - ganization of the League .

		As at present consti - tuted , it is possible for the
Authors ' League of America	ORGANIZATION	to do a great deal to make conditions easier for authors .

		As a
Union the League	ORGANIZATION	would not be strengthened , but instead weakened by the disaffection of hundreds of writers .

		The authors would soon find , as the Newswriters found , that the satisfaction of posing as laboring man and holding a Union card is not sufficient to overcome the disadvantages of a situation where , in the words of the once popular song , it is `` all goin ' out and nothin ' comin ' in . ''

		PEOBLEMS IN PUNCTUATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your very complimentary review of my work on punctuation -LRB- THE DIAL ,
June 22	DATE	-RRB- you give an excellent illustration of how faulty punctuation affects the meaning of language , but you make what seems to me a peculiar comment upon the reason for the improper use of marks in your illustrative sentence .

		The following is your sen - tence : `` Her costume was old-fashioned , grotesque , unbecoming , in short , positively hideous . ''

		You point out the erroneous relation , as implied by the punctuation , between what precedes and what fol - lows `` in short '' ; and you add ; `` Yet few writers would take the little trouble necessary to make this clear to the eye . ''

		What is the `` little trouble '' ?

		I take it to be that `` few writers '' see the true relation between the parts of the sentence , and therefore do not know how to indicate to the eye the real relation between the adjectives in the sentence .

		This relation , I think , is unmistakable .

		The writer of the sentence began a series of adjectives to describe a costume .

		After using three , he broke away -LRB- dashed off -RRB- , and sought a word to summarize his thoughts , expressed and unexpressed .

		The change is prop - erly shown by a dash , just as it is shown when a series of details is begun , and the writer breaks off and summarizes by the word `` all , '' followed by the verb that would have followed the com - pleted series .

		You say that I erroneously assign the
year 1826	DATE	as the date of the first appearance of
Wilson	PERSON	's work on punctuation .

		It seems to me you are hair-splitting in this statement .

		The preface to the twentieth edition of
Wilson	PERSON	's work gives
1826	DATE	as the date when an edition of his book was first published .

		It is true that this edition was designed solely for printers , while
1844	DATE	was the date of the first edition of his `` Treatise on Punctuation . ''

		As I did not name the foregoing title , it can hardly be said that my statement is erroneous .

		HOMER IN ENGLISH HEXAMETERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have a fellow feeling for Mr.
Bayard Quincy Morgan	PERSON	, who writes in your issue of
June 8	DATE	about `` Homer in English Hexameters . ''

		Some years ago , when I was teaching Homer , I felt just as he does .

		I collected specimens of English transla - tions , and wrote out some thoughts on translating Homer .

		And I translated enough of the `` Iliad to make a little pamphlet to show what I could do ; for I am not satisfied with discussion I want to work out my ideas , just as Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	does .

		As he suggests , discussion will never prove that Homer can be translated into good English hexameter poetry .

		The thing must be actually done .

		And when it is done , discussion is needless .

		The great essential , it seems to me , is to attain a natural English style , free from bookish diction , straightforward , masterly yet unpretending in its simplicity , musical and poetical .

		Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	asks if others have attempted a hexameter version .

		Mr.
Prentiss Cummings	PERSON	has published such a translation , though I am not acquainted with it .

		The ``
New York	LOCATION	Evening Post '' of
January 21 , 1911	DATE	, contained a letter by Dr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	of

		What do these governments , or these armies , care for dream - ers ?

		This characteristically exaggerated passage accurately conveys the helpless feeling of the man in the crowd , who can not make his will effective , and does not realize that the trouble is largely with himself , he does not clearly know what he wants .

		The cynicism and ridi - cule of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is intended only to show him how incompetent he is , to wake him up , and make him receptive to definite and positive proposals .

		The supersaturated solution of good-will is to crystallize , at least in part , around the book before us .

		One of the best chapters , '' The Outlook for the Germans , '' describes the essence of the difficulty so clearly that we hope it may have some effect even on Germans who chance to read it .

		There can be no doubt that the British intelligence has grasped and kept its hold upon the real issue of this war with an unprecedented clarity .

		At the outset there came declarations from nearly every type of British opinion that this war was a war against the Hohenzollern militarist idea , against Prussianism and not against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In that respect
Britain	LOCATION	has documented herself up to the hilt .

		There have been , of course , a number of passionate outcries and wild accusations against Germans , as a race , during the course of the struggle ; but to this day opinion is steadfast , not only in
Britain	LOCATION	, but if I may judge from the papers I read and the talk I hear , through - out the whole English-speaking community , that this is a war not of races but ideas .

		I am so certain of this that I would say if

		vulsion expelled her dynasty and turned herself into a republic , it would be impossible for the British Gov - ernment to continue the war for long , whether it wanted to do so or not .

		The forces in favor of reconciliation would be too strong .

		In this connection it is well to note an `` Appeal for Cooperation towards Lasting Peace , '' recently circulated by Dr.
David S. Jordan	PERSON	on behalf of another whose name is not given .

		It is issued in the name of citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	who were themselves or their immediate ancestors born in one of the countries now at war , and is therefore the first definite attempt of persons of these different nationalities to get together on a common plat - form .

		It has been very largely signed , but unfortunately its terms are so ambiguous that it can not be said to represent a true solution of the issues contested .

		It asks for an immedi - ate and lasting peace , `` based on the principles of international justice and not dependent on the fortunes of war , '' and urges that the
United States	LOCATION	should throw its whole weight in this direction .

		With this proposal we must of course sympathize , but we are in accord with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	in believing that it is neces - sary frankly to define the issues , and conceal none of the planks of the platform on which men of all nations may ultimately meet .

		Ger - mans , French , and English must work together with a common purpose for a com - mon end , but let us be honest about it : Let us build no false hopes nor pretend to any false generosities .

		These hatreds can die out only in one way : by the passing of a generation , by the dying out of the wounded and the wronged .

		Our business , our unsentimental business , is to set about establishing such conditions that they will so die out .

		And that is the business of the sane Germans too .

		Behind the barriers this war will have set up between
Germany	LOCATION	and anti-Germany , the intelligent men in either camp must prepare the ultimate peace they will never enjoy , must work for the days when their sons at least may meet as they themselves can never meet , without accusation or resentment , upon the common business of the World Peace .

		That is not to be done by any conscientious sentimentalities , any slobbering denials of unforgetable injuries .

		We want no Pro- German Leagues any more than we want Anti-German Leagues .

		We want patience and silence .

		American citizens of German or English origin will not forget these things because they are politically aloof , but it should be much easier for them to work together than for their relatives in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Becoming American , they have already adopted a plat - form and a system of ideas which , if applied to
Europe	LOCATION	, would remove the causes of the war .

		They have not themselves , with rare exceptions , had any part in the conflict .

		European enough to care , American enough to have democratic ideals , they should be able to stand together for a radical solution of
Europe	LOCATION	's troubles .

		At the same time , if they 54 -LSB-
July 15	DATE	are sincere , they will face the problems as they exist , instead of evading them for the sake of a fictitious harmony .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's chapter on `` What the War Is Doing for Women '' shows how the necessities of the nations have entirely changed the posi - tion of women , who have shown themselves capable of doing the most varied and difficult work , and have faced dangerous or disagree - able tasks with equal courage and equanimity .

		`` There can be no question that the behavior of the great mass of women in
Great Britain	LOCATION	has not simply exceeded expectation but hope . ''

		After the war , it will be impossible to restore the ancient conventions , and the emancipation of women will be taken as a matter of course .

		Says Mr.
Wells	PERSON	: Those women have won the vote .

		Not the most frantic outbursts of militancy after this war can prevent them getting it .

		The girls who have faced death and wounds gallantly in our cordite factories there is a not inconsiderable list of dead and wounded from those places have killed for ever the poor argument that women should not vote because they had no military value .

		Indeed they have killed every argument against their subjection ... It is not simply that the British women have so bountifully produced intelligence and industry ; that does not begin their record .

		They have been willing to go dowdy .

		The mass of women in
Great Britain	LOCATION	are wearing the clothes of
1914	DATE	.

		In
1913	DATE	every girl and woman one saw in the streets of
London	LOCATION	had an air of doing her best to keep in the fashion .

		Now they are for the most part as carelessly dressed as a busy business man or a clever young student might have been .

		They are none the less pretty for that , and far more beautiful .

		But the fashions have floated away to absurdity ... It is in
America	LOCATION	if any - where that the holy fires of smartness and the fashion will be kept alive .

		The chapter on the
United States	LOCATION	empha - sizes the necessity for the development of intelligent opinion in this country , something really dynamic and helpful .

		The great political conceptions that are needed to establish the peace of the world must become the common property of the mass of intelligent adults if they are to hold against the political scoundrel , the royal adventurer , the forensic exploiter , the enemies and scatterers of mankind .

		The French , Americans and English have to realize this necessity ; they have to state a common will and they have to make their possession by that will understood by the Russian people .

		Beyond that there lies the still greater task of making some common system of understandings with the intellectual masses of
China	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		At present , with three of these four great powers enormously preoccupied with actual warfare , there is an opportunity for guiding expression on the part of
America	LOCATION	such as may never occur again .

		As Mr.
Wells	PERSON	notes ,
America	LOCATION	has advanced a long distance from her earlier position of self-satisfied isolation , but she has still much to learn .

		It is still to be decided whether we shall chiefly appear to
Europe	LOCATION	as a jealous and potentially hostile competitor , or as a leader in the movement for the peace and progress of the world .

		If it is to be the latter , it will be because those of the larger vision have exerted themselves to the utmost to bring it about .

		In the contest of feeling and opinion which now stirs the country , much depends upon the clear formulation of issues , which party politicians and newspapers are doing their best to befog .

		The reformer will there - fore welcome Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's new book , whether he agree with all of it or not , as an important aid to clarity of thought .

		VARIOUS CHAPTERS FROM THE BOOK OF MATURE .

		* Setting out once more , imaginatively and with printed page to serve the office of magic carpet , for the beckoning mountains and waving woods and murmuring streams , we begin our ramble with Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	's `` Let Us Go Afield , '' collected chapters from the pen of an enthusiastic amateur of angling and bear-hunting and camping and other healthful pastimes that take one forth into the boundless open .

		To go bodily with Mr.
Hough	PERSON	into that open , or to follow in his foot - steps , would be impossible for most of us , since he pushes his excursions as far afield as the borders of
Mexico	LOCATION	and the remotest regions of
Alaska	LOCATION	even to
Kodiak Island	LOCATION	, `` the last and most abandoned of our national possessions . ''

		To accompany him in imagina - tion is a diversion already esteemed at its proper value by his readers .

		From these brisk and practical chapters on camping and hunt - ing and fishing we quote a typical passage .

		Evidently the writer , if he is a sentimentalist , does not pose as one .

		Taking life just as it has come to me from the outside , I confess that I personally have never seen the wild animals fashionable in the New Thought ; and I have never hesitated to go hunting , when I got the chance , with a rifle , and not a notebook , in hand .

		I have never met a soulful wolverene , have never encountered a magazine lynx , and never run across a
Sunday	DATE	newspaper wolf in all my simple , uneventful life .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 55 which gave me any shivers at all .

		I believe this is the experience of most big-game hunters .

		In first planning his book , `` The Hills of
Hingham	LOCATION	, '' Professor Sharp had intended it `` to set forth some features of the
Earth	LOCATION	that make it to be preferred to Heaven as a place of present abode , and to note in detail the peculiar attractions of
Hingham	LOCATION	over Bos - ton . ''

		But then came the war , and the gates of Hell swung wide open , so that
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	began to seem the better place ; and lesser local troubles multiplied , such as drouth , caterpillars , rheumatism , increase in commu - -LRB- tation rates , and more themes to correct than could comfortably be carried back and forth between
Hingham	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Thus the character of the book changed in the making , and practical questions crowded to the fore as the writer elaborated his chapters on and from the
Hingham	LOCATION	hills .

		Mullein Hill , the author 's place of abode , is the particular ele - vation that figures in the book as prominently as the low-lying hills of
Plymouth County	LOCATION	can figure ; and the practical problems of Mullein Hill do not lessen the readability of the series of chapters which there had their genesis .

		After humorous reference to the pro- fessor in the small college of Slimsalaryville who confessed himself obliged to wear long hair and let his wife do the washing in order that they might have bread and `` The Eugenic Review , '' the author continues : To walk humbly with the hens , that 's the thing after the classes are dismissed and the office closed .

		To get out of the city , away from books , and theories , and students , and patients , and clients , and custom - ers back to real things , simple , restful , healthful things for body and soul , homely domestic things that lay eggs at
70 cents	MONEY	per dozen , and make butter at
$ 2.25	MONEY	the 5-pound box !

		As for me , this does `` help immensely , '' affording me all necessary hair-cuts -LRB- I do n't want the `` Eugenie Review '' -RRB- , and allowing Her to send the family washing -LRB- except the flannels -RRB- to the laundry .

		But let it not be supposed that the homely domesticities monopolize the pages of this true lover of nature as well as of naturalness .

		Though he writes about `` spring plowing '' and `` mere beans '' and `` a pair of pigs , '' he writes as a poet , not as a ploughman .

		Daughter of the author of `` Captain
January	DATE	, '' and granddaughter of the author of `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic , '' Miss
Rosalind Richards	PERSON	helps to perpetuate in the third generation the literary renown of her family by offering to lovers of rural literature `` A Northen Countryside . ''

		With a map of
New England	LOCATION	before one , and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's biography within reach , it is not difficult to spell the word
Maine	LOCATION	in the veiled allusions and changed names that abound in this agree - able description of a region and people un - mistakably Yankee in character and rich in the qualities with which our `` do ^ m-East '' parents and grandparents -LRB- if we are fortu - nate enough to number any such in our pedigree -RRB- have made us familiar from infancy .

		Retired sea-captains do their part also to fix the locality referred to as
Watson	PERSON	's Hill , perhaps , or
Weir	PERSON	's
Mills	LOCATION	, or the
Upper Ponds	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Richards	PERSON	has thought best , in her kind regard for possible sensitiveness , to disguise both family and geographical names , and there is no danger of her book 's breeding any such rancor as followed the appearance of `` Cape Cod Folks '' and nobody knows how many other too cleverly realistic pictures of country life .

		Her chapters show a kindly affection for unurbanized human nature and an artist 's appreciation of inanimate nature .

		Openly and exultantly Mr.
Walter Emerson	PERSON	sings the praises of the
Pine Tree State	ORGANIZATION	in his profusely illustrated book , `` The Latchstring to
Maine Woods	LOCATION	and Waters . ''

		The precari - ous calling of politics , he tells us , has taken him many times to all parts of
Maine	LOCATION	, and , he humorously adds , `` since the average com - mon sense of all the people , as Mr.
Reed	PERSON	used to call it , can always be trusted to express itself at the polls , I have invariably had time after election , not only to consider how it all happened , but to appreciate what I had seen . ''

		And what he had seen convinced him that
Maine	LOCATION	has not yet won from the world the appreciation that is her due .

		She is still in the making , her possibilities remain to be developed , and the latchstring hangs hospita - bly out for all who would enter her fair domain and delve in her mines of health and wealth .

		Description and panegyric , anecdote and quotation , reminiscence and regretful note of wasted resources , mingle in readable fashion throughout the book , of which the fol - lowing is a representative passage : The primitive pines !

		Alas , they are going .

		And on many a
Maine	LOCATION	hill , where flourisheth the portable sawmill , deadly , unpoetic , and commercial , they sough no more .

		But there is , and for many generations will be , a wealth of spruce of many varieties , with fre - quent white and gray and yellow birches to relieve what otherwise might be an evergreen monotony .

		And so , for the present , we dismiss what might perhaps now , as Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	suggests , better be called the
Birch Tree State	ORGANIZATION	than the
Pine Tree State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its new and attractive cover , Dr.
William C. Prime	PERSON	's fourteen-year-old book , `` Along New England Roads , '' suitably swells the number of volumes now appearing in the field of what we have for convenience styled rural literature .

		The author has been dead more than eleven years , but that is no reason why his book should not enjoy a green old age .

		56 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	Such themes as sweet-scented fern , an angler 's
August	DATE	day , views from a hill-top in
Southern Vermont	LOCATION	, and hints for carriage travel are never out of date unless , unfor - tunately , it be the last .

		The chapter on non - resistance strikes a note undesignedly timely at this moment , though having nothing to do with trench warfare or Zeppelin outrages .

		The book 's few but pleasing woodcuts help to establish its maturity of years , which its pub - lishers refrain from alluding to except in small print on the reverse of the title-page .

		`` Rambles of a Canadian Naturalist , '' by Mr.
S. T. Wood	PERSON	, has striking attributes both in text and illustrations .

		Gently humorous and at times piquant in style , it entertains while it instructs ; and the delicately and truthfully colored illustrations by Mr.
Robert Holmes	PERSON	, with decorative headings by students of the
Ontario College of Art	ORGANIZATION	, add to one 's enjoyment of the book .

		Here is a rather good passage on the night-hawk : This bird has a mouth that may be called ridiculous , and his little , insignificant beak is but the handle to it .

		When darting at insects he opens his mouth and conceals himself behind it .

		Truly it is a mouth to wonder at .

		If you undertake to open the diminu - tive beak you will fancy that the bird has been cut in two horizontally .

		The Eel Fly or Mosquito which sees that mouth approaching never lives to hum the tale .

		It may be that the Night-hawk is ashamed of the cavernous receptacle with which he has been endowed , for he feeds at higher levels during early evening , and does not descend till night draws her sheltering mantle about his hideous disfigurement .

		The place of honor in this brief survey of a few of the season 's outdoor books shall be given to Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's `` Under the Apple-Trees , '' which combines in the writer 's well-known genial fashion both natural his - tory and philosophy , with a predominance of the former .

		But in a sense it is all natural history .

		`` We live in a wonderful world , '' says Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, `` and the wonders of the world without us are matched by the wonders of the world within us .

		This interior world has its natural history also , and to observe and record any of its facts and incidents , or trace any of its natural processes , is well worthy of our best moments . ''

		Hence we here have from his pen chapters on the various forms of life observed in an apple orchard , on the ancient problem of fate and free will , on
Dame Nature	ORGANIZATION	and her children , on the Bergsonian philosophy once more , on the friendly rocks , and on the primal mind , with various other themes belonging either to sci - ence or philosophy , or to the border-land between the two .

		By no means unanimous will be the assent to what , in a vein of self - depreciation and gentle humor , is thus expressed in the preface to these richly sug - gestive and richly remunerative essays : `` While writing my more philosophical dis - sertations , my mind often turns longingly toward the simple outdoor subjects which have engaged me so many years , and doubt - less the mind of my reader does also when he peruses them . ''


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		CAN SOCIALISTS STILL , BE CHRISTIANS ?

		* One of the pathetic phenomena of the
latter half of the nineteenth century	DATE	was the bick - ering between
Science and Religion	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the most regrettable of human facts was the array of foolish opinion and argument advanced by great men in both camps while it was still the fashion to reconcile the two fields .

		But Humanity does not quickly or easily drop the rudimentary organs which have functioned , however , poorly , in the past .

		The vermiform appendix survives after a hun - dred thousand years and a million cutting arguments against its human utility ; and in no unlike manner does the old quarrel , bequeathed by Science to Socialism , continue to prevail against `` reason and the Will of God . ''

		Science and Religion could not agree because they were essentially unlike ; Social - ism and Religion , more foolishly in the family fashion , quarrel because apparently they are so nearly alike in aim and ideal .

		Because the first Socialists -LRB- that is , the first scientific Socialists -RRB- , being radically minded , were Darwinians , and because many of them were atheists and many were materialists , -LRB- just as many were devout vegetarians and Baconians ; to use Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's illustration -RRB- , the tradi - tion became established that Socialism is essentially what the Socialists of
Marx	PERSON	's time generally were .

		And this tradition has remained even more impervious to moderation than the more famous one in regard to the irreconcilability of
Science and Religion	ORGANIZATION	.

		The task Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	has set himself in his book , `` Marxian Socialism and Religion , '' is `` a careful examination of the relation of the Marxian theories to the fundamental princi - ples of religion . ''

		The task itself is a needed one , despite many previous half-hearted attempts in the same general direction ; and the author is with little question the best man in
America	LOCATION	for the work , as the profound impression made a few years ago by his lec - ture on `` The Spiritual Significance of Modern Socialism '' attests .

		The results of Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's new book will not be final , .

		* MARXIAN SOCIALISM AND RELIGION .

		By
John Spargo	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL ,57 unhappily , but they can not fail to be com - mensurate with the effort .

		After consideration of a large number of fairly representative definitions of religion , the following composite is offered : `` Man 's belief in and worship of a supreme purposive Power -LRB- or powers -RRB- called God -LRB- or gods -RRB- , and the regulation of his life according to what he believes to be the pleasure or desire , or the commands , of the God -LRB- or gods -RRB- wor - shipped . ''

		Then the two theories which rep - resent the essentials of Marxism are stated .

		`` The first of these theories is sociological , offering an explanation of the evolution of society ; the second is economic , offering an explanation of the mechanism of capitalist society .

		The first is the well-known material - istic conception of history ; the second is the theory of surplus value . ''

		It is not the pur - pose of the author to pass judgment upon these theories -LRB- though his readers will be inclined to -RRB- , but merely to inquire if the ` doctrines themselves , or any of their necess - ary implications , conflict with the essentials of religion . ''

		The most valuable single feature of this book is its review of the first Marxian theory , to which great violence has been done .

		The terms of its statement have themselves been most unfortunate : `` materialistic conception of history '' and `` economic determinism '' are not tactful avenues of approach for tender minds .

		Though Marx at no time fully devel - oped this famous doctrine which underlies all his philosophy , leaving it thereby open to much misinterpretation , he did in `` Das Kapital '' sharply distinguish between histori - cal materialism and the abstract materialism of natural science .

		The former , stated in its simplest terms , is merely this : `` Methods of production , distribution , and exchange , .

		.

		together with such physical factors as race , climate , geographical position , and fertility of soil , constitute the economic environment which is the predominant factor in social evolution . ''

		Engels , the co-worker of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	, in many passages contends against the narrow interpretation put by neo-Marxian friends and enemies alike upon his theory .

		In a notable passage from `` Der Sozialistische Akademiker , '' quoted by Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	from
Seligman	PERSON	,
Engels	PERSON	wrote : `` The economic factor is the basis , but the various elements of the superstructure the political forms of the class contests , and their results , the constitutions the legal forms , and also the reflexes of these actual contests in the brains of the participants , the political , legal , philo - sophical theories , the religious views .

		.

		all these exert an influence on the develop - ment of the historical struggles , and in many instances determine their form . ''

		So far was
Marx	ORGANIZATION	from regarding this theory as antagon - istic to religion that he announced that only by means of it could the scriptures be prop - erly interpreted , a view concurred in by higher criticism .

		The theory of class conflicts , part and par - cel of historic materialism , and so bitterly assailed as un-Christian , appears in Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	?

		s view as thoroughly moral , in that it merely recognizes a condition actually existing , and substitutes principles for per - sonalities , attacking a system rather than individuals .

		In summary of this first Marxian principle , Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	says : `` The Marxian theory of historic materialism has nothing to do with those ultimate problems which lie beyond the realms of science and belong peculiarly to the realm of philosophy and religion ... It does not deny that other than material and economic factors , particularly ethics and religion , exert direct and independent influence upon the rate , manner and direction of the social evolution - ary process . ''

		The second fundamental principle of
Marx	PERSON	, the theory of surplus value , needs no argu - ment to prove that it is not essentially opposed to religion , except perhaps for those who interpret the idea of rendering unto
Caesar	PERSON	as a divine injunction to give
Caesar	PERSON	and his minions all the things they have enjoyed in the past without question of social justice or expediency .

		Many open-minded critics of Socialism will no doubt be ready to admit with Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	that in theory
Marx	PERSON	does not directly ques - tion the validity of religion , he simply does not occupy common ground ; they will be glad to find Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	believing that to the economic appeal must be added the ethical appeal ; but they will feel that the real issue against present-day Socialism has not been met .

		It matters little what
Marx	PERSON	and
Engels	PERSON	said ; it matters much what Socialists now think and do .

		Some Socialist lecturers openly announce that since everywhere they find organized religion opposed to Socialism they are going to strike at the root of the tree by attacking Christianity .

		So they begin by preaching Rationalism .

		These are the foolish friends , the real enemies , of Socialism , for they are doing their best to discredit the movement with truth-seeking people .

		Though Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	does not directly discuss the fool - ishly mixed programme of these propagand - ists , he does show exhaustively that every important body of Socialists in the world has done its best to set itself straight by announc - 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	ing that it does not presume to dictate in the field of religious conviction .

		The movement is not interested in another world ; its workers may have , as they do have , the same multiplicity of religious opinion and faith that obtains in the world at large .

		The author ends with a fine plea for better understanding and more enlightened coopera - tion between these two great uplifting forces in the world .

		`` Until the
Socialist State	ORGANIZATION	is reached , religion will be subject to the cruel limitations and restrictions inseparable from an economic system fundamentally unethical and anti-religious ... The
Golden Eule of Jesus	ORGANIZATION	will be crushed by the rule of gold .

		... In a real sense , then , Socialism is the emancipator of religion .

		What matters it that many Socialists with their lips deny God , if with their lives they serve Him and do His will ? ''

		The body of Socialists of Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's per - suasion is growing daily .

		They are not all in good party standing .

		Some of them believe the party rule tyrannical , and in certain respects the antithesis of democracy .

		Some of them believe that Individualism is not and must not be divorced from Socialism .

		Some of them demand that the ethical be given a place in the movement as high as its importance justi - fies , seeing that in the mobilization of all man 's noblest impulses religion can in no wise be neglected .

		But all of them find in Socialism the live ethic of religion .

		The Church can thunder its commandment to `` Love God , '' which is comparatively easy ; but it will require the simple mechanism of Socialism to fulfil the more difficult injunc - tion to `` Love thy neighbor as thyself . ''

		The peculiarities of this English , coupled with professorial preferences of the author , disclose themselves in his work , and are to be attributed to either an original British dialect , archaisms held against living speech , foreign influences , slovenliness , affectation and over - precision , or two or more of these in combina - tion .

		The reason may possibly be found on pages 38 and 39 of the book , in a discussion of what Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	calls either `` terminal r '' or `` r which occurs in the middle of a word '' ; but which should be stated as `` r before a conso - nant or mute e. '' Here he commits himself to such observations as these : `` While it is true that most English people neglect or alto - gether omit the final r , and many Americans , particularly those of the upper classes in our large cities , contrive to forget it , it is never - theless true that the vast majority of the educated men and women in
America	LOCATION	who are simple and unaffected do retain a distinct trace of the terminal r. .

		.

		The lack of an r is felt by many to be an affectation . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 59 Questions demanding answer from one cap - able of such statements are many .

		`` Why should Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	teach what by his own admission is middle or lower class or rustic ?

		Why ignore the mother country ?

		Why ignore
New England	LOCATION	and the
Southern States	LOCATION	?

		Why the sneer in `` contrive to forget it '' ?

		Why speak of `` the vast majority of the educated men and women '' when it is manifest that their education and cultivation do not extend to their pronunciation ?

		How can rustic or middle class speech look upon itself as `` simple and unaffected '' when , if it persist before a better example , it becomes that worst of affectations , the affectation of unaffected - ness and simplicity , as here ?

		And how can a mode of pronunciation having the authority in
America	LOCATION	of the names we have cited be held an `` affectation '' except through igno - rance ?

		The proper use of the fork is regarded by some persons as an affectation .

		So are good manners by the underbred .

		So are tooth - brushes and daily baths by many .

		So , `` some - where east of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	, '' are the Ten Command - ments .

		There is , it may be admitted , a democratic prejudice against any mode of speech that differentiates one from one 's countrymen , especially when it savors of wider travel and more exclusive associations .

		But why should Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	lend himself to the word `` affectation '' in the premises ?

		Many of us hold that democracy 's function is not to pull down the superior but to elevate the inferior .

		Why should he take a contrary position and seek to teach Americans an English poorer than the best ?

		He nowhere ventures to assert that the English spoken by nearly every person illustrious in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can letters , drama , statecraft , and oratory is not a better English than his own , but he does venture upon a covert sneer thereat .

		Note that the word `` educated '' in this con - nection begs the whole question .

		There is no doubt that `` the vast majority '' of American educational institutions pay worse than no attention to English speech .

		There is no doubt that their student bodies generally speak an English branded as bad by those better informed and made none the better by their habitual ridicule of good speech .

		There is no doubt whatever and here 's the pity that their faculties , recruited from such stu - dent bodies , set bad examples .

		How , then , can `` education '' in such institutions carry the slightest authority in a field they con - fessedly neglect and have always neglected , as the preface to Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's book implies ?

		And how is such instruction as his book affords , laden with inaccuracies as it is , going to better conditions ?

		Why not face the facts ?

		Two important bodies in the
United States	LOCATION	do pay the special attention to English speech which Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	and his fellow-teachers have so ignored the American stage and American society , both at their best .

		There are also a few schools and colleges where every student is exposed to good English from the mouths of their faculties and most of their pupils , whether he study it or not .

		Why not go to these accredited sources for authority , now that the schools are taking up the subject with untrained and ignorant instructors , as Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	says ?

		RECENT POETRY .

		* Our present sheaf is wholly of American poems , and may be appropriately begun with Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	's odes on the two wonders , God - made and man-made , which
California	LOCATION	showed to the world in
1915	DATE	, the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	and the
Panama-Pacific Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		In both cases Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	is disposed to find the chief significance of his theme in the hope of human brotherhood , and this , very naturally , is rather easier to relate to the Exposition than to the
Yosemite	LOCATION	.

		In the latter instance he leaps rather wilfully , as
Shelley	PERSON	often did , from sensueus to social ideals .

		The mountain walla send up Their eagles on the
morning	TIME	, ere the gleam Of the great day-star fall on wood and stream ; From south to north What golden wings , what argent feet go forth On heaven and radiant snows !

		What archangelic flights Of seraphim from everlasting heights , * YOSEMITE .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	From citadels colossal , where the song Of giant winds is strong , And , washed in timeless fire , the granite glows With silver and unutterable rose !

		O vaster Dawn , ascendant and sublime , That past the peaks of Time And midnight stars ' array , Dost bear the magnitude of skies to be , What hopes go forth to thee !

		O glad , unrisen Day !

		The soul , an eagle from its eyrie yearning , Goes up against the splendor and the burning Goes up , and sees afar the world made free !

		These lines , near the close of the Yosemite ode , perhaps do justice to Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	's capacity to accomplish occasional fine effects , both of rhythm and phrasing , as well as to the nobility of his double theme .

		There is nothing so good , I think , in the Exposition Ode ; yet on the other hand the fitness of the latter for its purpose is the more certain .

		The somewhat oratorical effects of the irreg - ular ode form are well adapted to an audience and an occasion , whereas one does not care to contemplate the notion of Mr.
Sterling	PERSON	declaiming his lines in the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thomas Walsh	PERSON	's volume , called `` The Pilgrim Kings '' from a brief but finely con - ceived interpretation of the story of the magi , takes us far from contemporary men and things .

		It is especially concerned with old
Spain	LOCATION	, its princes , artists , and architecture , and sometimes is notably successful in the reproduction of the desired atmosphere .

		The more conspicuous poems are in dramatic form , studies of painters like
Goya	ORGANIZATION	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, and
El Greco	PERSON	, at imagined moments when the character of themselves or their pictures can be interpreted in fugitive dialogue somewhat reminiscent of the monologues of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Quite worth while as these scenes doubtless are , they do not seem to me to form the really satisfying portion of the volume , partly , per - haps , because they inevitably challenge com - parison with the richer historic interpreta - tions of
Browning	PERSON	, and partly because Mr.
Walsh	PERSON	's blank verse is undeniably tame .

		His rhymed lines are often well wrought and individual .

		For example , take this `` River Song '' from a group of
Alhambra	LOCATION	lyrics : There came as tribute out of far
Bagdad Unto Alhambra	LOCATION	once a minstrel lad Who all day long touched softly on the strings The river song the Tigris boatman sings .

		A sun-bronzed slave who toiled among the flowers O'erheard a sob from the
Sultana	LOCATION	's bowers , And whispered , '' Minstrel , wake that note no more ; She too in childhood knew our Asian shore ; Fair is
Alhambra	LOCATION	, but by pool or dome , Sing here no more that song of youth and home .

		* ' With Mr.
Burnet	PERSON	's poems we return again to to-day ; they are of the war in
Belgium	LOCATION	, of the streets of
New York	LOCATION	, the
Woolworth	ORGANIZATION	Building and the Subway .

		Some of them are up-to-date in ways of which I in common , I am sure , with others have already begun to weary a little , the effort , for instance , to make poetry play the part of editorial on problems of poverty and labor , sweat-shops and prostitution .

		-LRB- Why should the last - named institution be forcibly raised to lyrical quality by dubbing its representatives `` Sis - ters of the Cross of Shame '' ? -RRB-

		But with this passing protest noted , I find Mr.
Burnet	PERSON	's social feeling , and his poetic feeling too , to be on the whole sound arid stimulating .

		The finest elaborate poem in his collection is ``
Gayheart	PERSON	, a Story of Defeat , '' which attracted some attention on its appearance in a periodical , the story of a young journalist who lost his idealism in a
New York	LOCATION	board - ing-house .

		In doing so he found worldly success .

		His boyishness had died .

		His hard , clean youth Was gone for ever ` neath a whelm of clay .

		Yet as I looked I saw him lift his head , And all his grossness seemed to fall away .

		His hungry look went straight to
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's throne , High up into the folded book of stars , And on his face I saw the Quest again He was the seeker , fainting with his scars !

		This last line exemplifies an annoying weak - ness of Mr.
Burnet	PERSON	's his willingness to let the rhyme make his phrasing .

		Men do not faint with scars .

		A number of such termina - tions mar the workmanship of the poem ; but I am quite willing to admit that to stress them strongly , in the face of the poet 's veracious and fine-spirited portrayal of the struggle of youth with the bigness and the sordidness of the city , would be the mark of a petty mind .

		I wish that the volume were smaller , and had taken a little longer in the making .

		That its writer can sometimes attain beauty of finish let this little lyric attest : Love , when the day is done , When all the light grows dim , When to the setting sun Rises the
Vesper Hymn	PERSON	, Let us stand heart to heart , We who have toiled so far , Bidding the day depart Seeking the risen star I Mr ,
Marquis	PERSON	's `` Dreams and Dust '' is a book that appeals strongly either to one 's amiability or one 's ill-temper , according as one is disposed to be sympathetic with youth .

		-LRB- Having said which , I feel bound to praise it beyond its deserts ! -RRB-

		I have no notion what the actual age of the author may be ; but his work seems to me to be singularly typical of what a sensitive and intelligent young person might be supposed to think and to say on
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 almost anything .

		There is a wide variety of themes , and on almost all of them one can predict instantly , on their being introduced , what will be said .

		Yet despite this , the writer j is a sufficiently good workman to avoid mere i triteness , and one feels that the sense of obvi - ousness is not due to borrowing , but to natural community of experience .

		Here is a bit out of a `` madrigal '' which shows Mr.
Marquis	PERSON	's lyrical verse at its pleasantest : Arise , arise , briar rose , And sleepy violet !

		Awake , awake , anemone , Your wintry dreams forget For shame , you tardy marigold , Are you not budded yetf Up , blooms !

		and storm the wooded slopes , The lowlands and the plain Blow , jonquil , blow your golden horn Across the ranks of rain !

		To arms !

		to arms !

		and put to flight The
Winter	DATE	's broken train !

		More vigorous , on the other hand , and indeed of outstanding individuality in the whole col - lection , is a poem called `` The Struggle , '' which describes a conflict between the speaker and a mysterious being `` man , god , or devil '' whom he has come upon in a deep gorge , and whom he at length overcomes and throt - tles .

		It ends thus : Between the rifted rocks the great sun struck A finger down the cliff , and that red beam Lay sharp across the face of him that I had slain ; And in that light I read the answer of the silent gods Unto my cursed-out prayer , For he that lay upon the ground was I !

		There are , to be sure , three more lines , but there ought not to be , so I stop here for the poem 's sake .

		Another volume breathing forth the spirit of youth , but with far more artistic individu - ality , is Mr.
William A. Percy	PERSON	's `` Sappho in Levkas . ''

		I have not seen for some time a re-study of a well-worn classical theme , like this of the passion of Sappho for Phaon , show - ing so much fresh poetic charm .

		If the author -LRB- I say again in ignorance -RRB- indeed be young , he is fortunate not only in having captured something of that beauty of ancient poesy which was once but is not now the com - !

		mon heritage of educated youth , but also in having the traditionally `` classical '' combina - ; tion of beauty and restraint .

		I can not think ; the metrical form of the poem to be as good as it deserves ; the moderately irregular , ode - j like rhythms of which it is composed seem j so experience teaches to call for rhyme .

		A j passage like this , therefore , Beyond the violet-circled isles , yea , to The confines of the habitable world My singing reached ; nor can I think The times come ever when the hearts of men So stripped of brightness be But they will shake with rapture of my songs perplexes the senses of the reader as approx - imating to the familiar blank-verse cadence yet departing from it without the accustomed compensation .

		The same circumstance impairs , for me , another of the longer poems in the volume which is of delightful imagi - native quality ; it represents St.
Francis	PERSON	's reputed sermon to the birds .

		From this I quote what space will allow , knowing that those who read will wish for more : O swallows , should you see , when evening comes , One leaning from his darkened window , dark , His eyes unlighted , bitter with the day 's defeat , Toss where your vagrant flight may catch his gaze ; For , as you scatter up the golden sky , Haply he may remember
Jacob	PERSON	's dream , The ladder and the wings and , holpen , send his heart In God 's light careless way to climb with you .

		And you , sweet singers of the dark , That tune your serenades but by the stars , Love gardens most ; For gardens do unlock themselves With magic silentness unto your spell , And music unto sleepless eyes doth bring The lonely solace of unloosened tears .

		But most , you morning choristers , that haunt the eaves , ... Fail not to keep your matins clear for us ; And should you know , by some bird craft of yours , The room wherein an almost mother lies , Choir your sweetest there , as tho ' the babe to come Were son of God for so he is !

		Turn we now from youth to middle age .

		This is the meaning of Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	's title , `` The Middle Miles , '' and he is explicit to define the period as near the age of thirty - five .

		It is a depressing time , he tells us , with - out the consolations of either youth or age ; we are disposed to look forward with some impatience to the poet 's turning forty , that he may be a bit less self-consciously melan - choly .

		To speak more seriously , the volume represents the reflections of an eminently cultivated mind , phrased often with notably good taste .

		Many of the poems have the dis - tinctive charm of a familiar essay .

		The writer can not complain if the reader feels what he himself so clearly does , a certain lamented incapacity to sing songs `` set to vital tunes '' ; instead , he tells us , the poets of to-day -LRB- which seems , in a way , to be the world 's middle age -RRB- sing remembered memorable days , Unforgettable loves tenderly nursed by time , Mad exquisite deeds worthy a thousand voices , Sombre and delicate visions , permanent in perpetual evanescence , but try in vain to `` strike out crashing seven - hued chords . ''

		After all this , it is only fair to note that the collection includes a `` Song Triumphant , '' ending with this heartening , if unnecessarily formless , strophe : 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15 Truth	DATE	, truth , ye cry !

		But I Seek not to fix the colored spray , Seek not to stay Wave , wind , or gradual star : To-day Is mutable as these things are .

		Yet the vast sway , The under - rhythm God 's pulse-beat shall not fail .

		God 's song above God 's silence shall prevail .

		`` The House that Was '' is a skull , and Mr. Low undertakes to recreate from it , with fine imaginative insight , the riches of the life that had been lived within it .

		There is a sound in thee , cold skull , Too cobweb-thin for ears , too frail to die .

		Such sound as follows singing , when a bird Has fluted once and flown , and sings no more : Such sound as breathes out petal sighs that fall When stars touch roses , or a late moon strays Through sleeping gardens of the long ago .

		Yes , there is music in thee ; as a stone Shed from some ancient capital , and found , After slow centuries of creeping mould , All grown with moss and crumbled with decay With every broken leaf , in each blurred line , Sings of its haughty lineage for aye .

		Here , one sees at once , is the authentic touch of poetry ; and it is almost everywhere in Mr.
Low	PERSON	's book , not only in imagery but in method of thinking .

		Delightful is the little scene of boy and girl love , called '' Once Upon a Time '' : Dear God I to see you where the wind had gone , All in soft shadow , still as
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, Knee-deep , and lifting from the water 's brim Your looped-up garments ... Star-eyed sera - phim Came down and kissed you , kneeling , with their eyes .

		Delightful , too , is the dialogue between the Little Boy and the Locomotive .

		`` All night , '' says the boy , `` in dreams when you pass by You breathe out stars that fill the sky , And now , when all my dreams are true , I hardly dare come close to you . ''

		`` But you , '' says the locomotive , `` you drop of morning dew , God and his heaven are globed in you . ''

		This little volume contains no outstanding or astonishing poem , but its remarkably high level of intensive poetic quality , from page to page , distinguishes it at once from the com - mon case where it is plain that the half would have been better than the whole .

		Of this latter sort is Mrs.
Frank	PERSON	's collec - tion , which is professedly a reminiscent kind of portfolio , in part covering she tells us ` her `` sixteen-year-old period , '' and as such of more interest to her immediate friends than to the public .

		I do not know why , even so , she should have cared to preserve some of the contents , such as Half the stars are dim with weeping ,
Antoinette	PERSON	.

		See the moon how palely sleeping ,
Antoinette	PERSON	.

		But the reader whose eye lights first on a piece of banality like this is presently aston - ished to find close by it one or another poem of distinctive insight and force .

		Barely is the form as good as the thought , but some - times it takes care of itself adequately , even if not cared for .

		For example , note these lines , full of vivid experience , representing a `` Night-Mood '' : The wind of the world Is on our cheeks .

		Surely the infinite Blew upon us and we shuddered .

		The fires of God Are underneath us , and this planet 's sod Is as a shell .

		Where shall we flee from God ?

		He presses too close upon us .

		O , in all space What then shall shield me but your bending face !

		Closer !

		closer !

		What are we ?

		A shifting breeze That the winds of the world will gather .

		Still better is a poem of which I can quote only a fragment , called `` The Mother '' : They have sought wild places , And touched the wind-bound Pole , But I shall go a-venturing After a soul .

		Stark is the journey , unknown ; Yet I shall traverse pain , For a soul is a shy , wild thing , And strange to attain .

		I shall pluck it out of eternity .

		O , I shall laugh with glee !

		And high in my hand shall I hold it For God to see .

		A new volume of poems by Mr.
Edwin Arlington Kobinson	PERSON	is fairly certain to do two things for us .

		It will furnish us real creations in character , like those of dramatist or novelist ; and it will represent further interesting studies in the problem of making diction at once colloquial and poetical .

		The collection called `` The Man against the Sky '' does not disappoint us in either particular .

		It opens with a fine little character sketch of `` the man Flammonde '' ; it includes also por - traits of personages as different as old
King Cole	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Jonson	PERSON	, and two very real quarrelsome modern lovers called
John Gorham	PERSON	and
Jane Wayland	PERSON	.

		I find per - haps because of its fitting into the recent ter - centenary the monologue of
Jonson	PERSON	, giving his view of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the most pleasing of these studies .

		I 'll meet him out alone of a bright
Sunday	DATE	, Trim , rather spruce , and quite the gentleman .

		`` What , ho , my lord ! ''

		say I .

		He does n't hear me ; Wherefore I have to pause and look at him .

		He 's not enormous , but one looks at him .

		A little on the round , if you insist , For now , God save the mark , he 's growing old ; He 's five and forty , and to hear him talk These days you 'd call him eighty ; then you 'd add
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 63 More years to that .

		He 's old enough to be The father of a world , and so he is .

		``
Ben	PERSON	, you 're a scholar , what 's the time of dayt '' Says he ; and there shines out of him again An aged light that has no age or station The mystery that 's his a mischievous Half - mad serenity that laughs at fame .

		The title poem stands , oddly enough , at the - end of the volume , and is a kind of final mys - tical character-study of a nameless man who becomes from being seen on a clearly outlined hill-top , descending to some unknown place a type of Man himself .

		Where was he going , this man against the skyf You know not , nor do I .

		But this we know , if we know anything : That we may laugh and fight and sing , And of our transience here make offering To an orient Word that will not be erased , Or , save in incommunicable gleams Too permanent for dreams , Be found or known ... No planetary trap where souls are wrought For nothing but the sake of being caught And sent again to nothing , will attune Itself to any key of any reason `` Why man should hunger through another season To find out why ` twere better late than soon To go away and let the sun and moon And all the silly stars illuminate A place for creeping things , And those that root and trumpet and have wings , And herd and ruminate , Or dive and flash and poise in rivers and seas , Or by their loyal tails in lofty trees Hang , screeching lewd victorious derision Of man 's immortal vision .

		I must repeat here , what I said in a former paper in connection with some of the poetry of Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	, that this sort of work - manship is highly significant to those inter - ested in the poetic art , as showing how all the effects of directness , veracity , and individual - ity can be obtained , not only without losing the sense of beauty but what is especially pertinent to our generation without losing the sense of form .

		Poems concerning the war are abundant , here as in
England	LOCATION	, and for the most part are equally negligible here as there .

		The obviousness of that which one must feel con - cerning the great conflict seems to pall upon the poetic spirit , like trite condolences on the day of a funeral .

		The verse of
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	is always to be listened to with respect , but her little volume of war poems , `` The White Messenger , '' has not escaped the unfavorable influences of which I have spoken .

		The senti - ments are such as almost all can share , but didactic generalization hangs upon a great part of them .

		This little poem , called `` Spilt `` Wine , '' escapes it because it frankly keeps to the particular moving fact : A flower of youth a Linus boy , He bore a glass of purple wine ; His step was Pride , his glance was Joy A flower of youth divine !

		i One shattering blow !

		The crystal broke Fast flowed away the precious wine .

		It was the brutish Earth that spoke , `` I drink but what is mine !

		`` For mother of all fruits am I , Who send them up , to tree and vine ; To give them back should none deny , When I with thirst shall pine . ''

		I looked again .

		So quickly shed , The flower of youth , his blood for wine !

		And brutish
Earth	LOCATION	, deep-murmuring , said , `` I drink but what was mine . ''

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's new volume , on the other hand , called ``
Italy	LOCATION	in Arms , '' touches only the edge of the .

		war , as
Italy	LOCATION	herself has done , and it is the title poem alone which assures us that the poet wishes her well in the conflict , apparently not for any social or political reason , but because of the groves of Vallom - brosa and similar things .

		The book is , in effect , a kind of poet 's journal of travels in the land best loved of poets , and none who know Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's verse will need to be told that it is compact of pleasant images and pleasant melodies , wholly free from the weight of arduous thinking .

		This sketch of `` A Roman Twilight '' is perhaps among the best of the traveller 's memories : The purple tints of twilight over
Rome	LOCATION	; Against the sunset great Saint
Peter	PERSON	's dome , And through the gateways peasants wending home .

		Shadows that gather round the
Aventine	LOCATION	; And just above the dim horizon line The star of Hesper , like a light divine .

		A perfume faint as of forgotten sweets , As though there came , far-borne through lonely streets , The breath of violets from the grave of Keate !

		Of the poems called forth by the war , which have been read in American periodicals , none attracted more interest than
Miss Cone	ORGANIZATION	's ` Chant of Love for
England	LOCATION	, '' written in reply to the German Song of Hate .

		This forms the title poem of a widely varied col - lection , marked throughout by fine feeling and the influences of the intellectual life , with somewhat uneven workmanship .

		From the standpoint of the interpretive imagination , one of the best pieces in the volume is that called `` The Gaoler , '' in which the soul speaks of the body .

		To be free , to be alone , Is a joy I have not known .

		To a keeper who never sleeps I was given at the hour of birth By the governors of earth ; And so well his watch he keeps , Though I leave no sleight untried , That he will not quit my side ... 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	I have cried to the winds , the sea , '' Oh , help me , for ye are free ! ''

		I have thought to escape away , But his hand on my shoulder lay .

		From the hills and the lifting stars He has borne me back to bars ; With the spell of my murmured name He has captived and kept me tame .

		I have also found unexpected pleasure in
Miss Cone	LOCATION	's ode on
Lincoln	LOCATION	, written for the cen - tennial in
1909	DATE	, for surely one does not hope for much from more odes on Lincoln .

		They must be frankly expository ; but the exposition rises to some real imaginative effec - tiveness in a passage like this , where the `` voices of the outland folk '' take up the sound of praise , in answer to those of English blood : You shall not limit his large glory thus , You shall not mete his greatness with a span !

		This man belongs to us ,
Gentile	PERSON	and Jew ,
Teuton	LOCATION	and Celt and Euss And whatso else we be !

		This man belongs to Man !

		And never , till a flood of love efface The hard distrusts that sever race from race , Comes his true jubilee !

		Much has been expected from a new volume by Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, who attained a somewhat ambiguous fame through the `` Spoon River Anthology '' ; but the book of `` Songs and Satires '' is a miscellany , and not a few will be disappointed in finding in it only a few mono - logues of the
Spoon River	LOCATION	type .

		This type , original and fascinating though somewhat inversely to its characteristically poetic appeal , may be briefly described as a com - posite of the dominant moods of Swift ,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Some readers are most attracted by the Swiftian power of merciless but not unsympathetic observation of the foul and ugly , some by the Whitmanesque affection for the common but unconventional , some by the Shavian habit of laughing in the wrong place .

		The result - ing effects are often almost important , but usually not quite important , because Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, unlike the three writers just named , has no style .

		By style I mean a consistent medium of expression used with a sense of form , either prosaic or poetic , a thing the very want of which has proved to be appeal - ing , for a large portion of our reading public greatly prefers the habit which dashes reck - lessly and amusingly from this manner to that .

		With this in mind , I am tempted to find in a certain elegant simile of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's a description of many of his own effects : `` You are a Packard engine in a
Ford	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		For there is no denying him some of the admirable qualities which I attribute -LRB- wholly by hearsay -RRB- to a Packard engine .

		On the other hand , I should not think of apply - ing to him the neighboring metaphor from the same poem : `` A barrel of slop that shines - on
Lethe	LOCATION	's wharf . ''

		This , it will be observed , represents one of his taking manners .

		Another is that of pure prose , not even cut into rhythmic lengths ; for instance , `` This city had a Civic Federation , and a certain social order which intrigues through churches , courts , with an endless ramification of money and morals , to save itself . ''

		But these are not all .

		There are not only the moments of pene - trating insight into personality insight of novelist or comedian , one would say , charac - teristically , but also , on occasion , the haunt - ing revelations of feeling which poetry exists - to communicate .

		I wish indeed that many of these compositions were worthy to be placed beside this one , called `` The Door '' ; This is the room that thou wast ushered in .

		Wouldst thou , perchance , a larger freedom win ?

		Wouldst thou escape for deeper or no breath ?

		There is no door but death .

		Do shadows crouch within the mocking light ?

		Stand thou !

		but if thy terrored heart take flight Facing maimed Hope and wide-eyed Nevermore , There is no less one door .

		Dost thou bewail love 's end and friendship 's doom , .

		The dying fire , drained cup , and gathering gloom t Explore the walls , if thy soul ventureth There is no door but death .

		There is no window .

		Heaven hangs aloof , Above the rents within the stairless roof .

		Hence , soul , be brave across the ruined floor Who knocks ?

		Unbolt the door !

		Some , I conceive , will say that I have selected this poem for praise , with vicious tradition - alism of spirit , because of its `` thous '' and `` wasts '' and other formal signs of poetic man - ner ; on the contrary , however , it is the worse for them , and the last stanza alone , which is wholly direct as well as profoundly imagina - tive , is perfect .

		I conclude ` with Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's mysteri - ously titled volume , one of parodies of the verse of his contemporaries .

		He imagines a `` banquet of the bards , '' wherein the cele - brants display their various poetic modes in so characteristic fashion that the layman , might well , at times , have difficulty in distin - guishing burlesque from reality .

		With cer - tain of the personages represented I confess - to having no acquaintance , and wonder that they should deserve the fame which parody implies ; but contemporary fame is a swift and mysterious thing .

		Most enjoyable , per - haps , are Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's representations of such current phenomena as imagism , free verse , and `` polyphonic prose . ''

		Thus The iron menace of the pillar-box is threatening ; the virginity of night , and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 65 Zip !

		the thought of you tears in my heart I fumble and start ; the first of these lines being attributed to Mr.
Ezra Pound	PERSON	and the second to Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is also made to say , how characteristically it would perhaps be unbe - coming to observe : Come , my songs , let us sing about something It is time we were getting ourselves talked about .

		And Mr.
James Oppenheim	PERSON	's rasher moments of inspiration are represented in some lines beginning : Oh
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Freud	LOCATION	, and
Jung	ORGANIZATION	, Help me to cast off these wrappers of custom and prohibition , Tear down the barriers of reticence !

		The fact is that free verse , and the other more superficial elements of exaggerated romanticism , lend themselves rather too easily to the art of the parodist to make the results very highly worth while .

		But if one could find a poet who represented them in a really important way , and could then exhibit in burlesque the essential spirit as well as the manner in question , as
Calverley	PERSON	did -LRB- for example -RRB- in his famous parody of `` The Ring and the Book , '' he might do a service of both literary and social significance .

		If Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	has not accomplished this , it is perhaps only for want of better material .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* All who think of the Great War think it will be a turning point in history .

		Whatever life is to be when the war is over , it will be different from what it is now .

		Just what the difference is to be , few try to state , but they feel that things can not be the same .

		One can see this in fiction , as elsewhere .

		In the first year of the war English fiction was much what it usually is .

		But by this time one can often see a clear effect .

		Men and women are interested in thinking of the old order which has come to an end , of the war itself which has had such an effect , of the new order which will arise .

		Miss
Mordaunt	PERSON	's `` The Family '' has not on the face of it anything at all to do with the war .

		It is the story of an English country family , at first not very unlike in its subject and story a good many novels of the eighties * THB FAMILY .

Elinor Mordaunt	PERSON	.

		and early nineties .

		Mr.
Hebberton	PERSON	is a typical country
Squire	PERSON	, he and his wife are definite mid-Victorians continuing on into the end-of - the-century period , the children are not mark - edly one thing more than another .

		The book might superficially interest people chiefly as being one more picture of that extraordinary family life , which -LRB- we are taught to believe in novels -RRB- English people not only endure but like .

		It is a family life where everyone pursues his or her object with no regard to anybody else , unless the anybody can be made temporarily useful ; where each one speaks his mind out without any considera - tion for anybody else , and with an invariable inclination to be disagreeable if it be in the least degree possible ; where nobody has a notion of any other ideal of life except get - ting as much fun as one can out of the present ; where nobody thinks of any kind of useful occupation -LRB- in American , of earning a living -RRB- nor has or conceives any possible way of paying society for enduring his presence ; and in which all live in the greatest affection for each other and in the highest respect from every one else .

		So the story begins .

		But as it goes on the family disintegrates , one brother enlists as a private , another becomes a prize-fighter , one goes off to
South Africa	LOCATION	, one gets on the stage ; one sister goes to Can - ada and travels about marrying people , one gets into a big store ; Pauline the chief figure marries , becomes a widow , and settles in a small house in
London	LOCATION	.

		The Squire and Mrs.
Hebberton	PERSON	give up the family place and go to live in a `` villa '' somewhere .

		Everything is broken up , and the family is scattered all about .

		They are finally got together some - how at
Pauline	LOCATION	's house in
London	LOCATION	.

		At a Christmas dinner at Mr.
Rabbit	PERSON	's , whom one of the girls has married ,
Pauline	PERSON	was struck by their look .

		`` There was nothing of the country-bred family left about them .

		The city had got them ; would keep them till they were dead and buried . ''

		Pauline was con - scious that it was part of a great change , a change coming in with the new century .

		`` I wonder if the world will be any better ! ''

		queried
Edward Grice	PERSON	.

		`` I do n't know , '' said
Pauline	PERSON	, `` but anyhow it will be different . ''

		Miss
Mordaunt	PERSON	is conscious enough that the case she is describing is significant .

		She shows a phase of life as she imagines it ; in thinking of life she was more or less possessed by the thought of change , of disintegration , of wreck , and she naturally conceived a story in which change , disintegration , and wreck were the dominating forces .

		She shows us one element out of the many which make up English society .

		But her chief interest was 66
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 15	DATE	truth to life , and by aiming chiefly at this she was able to gain also the other great advan - tage of giving one of the important currents of life of the time in which she was interested .

		Miss
Mordaunt	PERSON	was not thinking especially of the war , in fact , the social change she has in mind was effective before the war , though it must have been hastened by it .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	in `` The Dark Forest , '' on the other hand , deals directly with the war itself .

		He has already dealt with earlier conditions ; in '' The Duchess of Wrexe '' he had in mind the pass - ing of the old aristocratic leadership and the coming in of a new democracy , just as
Miss Mordaunt	LOCATION	has in mind the break-up of the old country life and the segregation of society in cities .

		Perhaps Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	may feel that the war has made his earlier subject too much a matter of history .

		At any rate , in this book he deals only with some phases of the war as it actually is , without much regard to its effect on anyone but the people he imagines and writes about .

		His general idea seems to be indicated by the name of the book .

		A hospital unit in the
Russian Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	service leaves
Petrograd	LOCATION	for the front , and finally gets settled in the Forest of S on the river Nestor , a great stretch of woodland and open country , village and wilderness .

		The forest seems to typify one 's state of mind during the war , any one 's Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's , yours , or mine , sombre but exciting , with all sorts of uncombined items , terrible , beautiful , uninteresting , any - thing you can imagine .

		Such is the war ; one leaves behind all relationships , save the chance connections of the service , and then all kinds of things happen .

		At the end one is much as before , except that -LRB- as
Pauline	PERSON	said -RRB- things are different .

		It is clear that one can not take up the old threads and begin over again .

		This is not , however , exactly the form of Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's story .

		In the story he is par - ticularly interested in two Englishmen who had volunteered for
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	service in
Russia	LOCATION	,
Durward	PERSON	who tells the story , and
Trenchard	PERSON	of whom the story is told .

		Of the latter , his love for
Marie Ivanovna	PERSON	, and his death in battle , is the story which is woven into the impressions that to my mind are the chief element of it .

		As is usual with Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	, it is the place and the people that he mostly impresses upon us .

		The Forest of S - is not more of a kaleidoscope than was life before they got to the forest .

		It is all alike .

		At one moment a village full of old people who have to be fed , a miserable , abandoned fantastic set of peo - ple ; then the forest itself , green and delicate and clear , with soft cool shadows and quiver - ing light and dark , with bird-song and silence ; a village where they had the cholera ; an empty house just behind the firing line , in a tangled desolate garden , the inside bare and dusty with a few old odds and ends left in it ; other such scenes , and throughout moments of deep intensity and hours of monotonous dul - ness .

		Probably the war is like that .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	is not concerned with what used to be or what is going to be , or with anything but what is at the moment and not often with that after the moment when it is of importance has passed away .

		Yet it is all important to those people ; they were never the same again , some were dead , but those who were alive went back to a life where they probably never picked up the old doings and habits they had left when the war began .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's `` The King 's Men '' is the one of these three books most especially directed to the influence of the war .

		It is an account of how the war affected a group of half a dozen young men of the general class of artists and workers .

		It is not a survey of the changes which the war is to bring about in our civilization , but it does show what is the immediate effect of the war on some individ - uals , which is probably as far as a. sensible man who knows anything about it will go just now .

		They all acted differently :
Rupert Smith	PERSON	saw that everybody would go ; he threw into the scrap-basket a novel he had just writ - ten , was shortly after gazetted and went exuberantly into
Goff	PERSON	's to buy all the things he could be persuaded to think he needed .

		Baddely at once said , `` I 'm not going to the war , '' for he was a comfortably married man in government service .

		But he did n't hold out long ; he enlisted very soon without say - ing anything to anybody .


Bob Rivers	PERSON	, being `` a linguist , an engineer , and an
Oxford Terrier	ORGANIZATION	whose enthusiasm was a byword in several regimental messes , '' very soon got into an active service regiment .


Kenneth John	PERSON	remained secretary to a Junior Whip who gave up whipping to manage a weekly which should direct public opinion , but even he went to the front pretty soon to `` study conditions . ''


Jim Pelham	PERSON	for a long time determined that he would do nothing about it .

		He hated the idea of being forced by public opinion to do just what everyone else was doing .

		He stuck it out longer than the rest , but he could n't stand the pressure ; at the moment of his most vigorous denial he was suddenly con - verted .

		This exhibition of various typical forms of volunteering may not be as really significant as one case of something a little different .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 67 There is an old fellow who is in partnership with his son .

		The old man thinks that the question of what the firm shall do in the crisis is for the partners to decide ; if they can help the government and make a big profit too , they might as well do it .

		His son thinks that if that sort of thing is left to private action , to volunteering , all sorts of things will hap - pen .

		He thinks that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	ought to take a hand in the matter .

		Of course this is just what has actually happened .

		Although until lately recruiting was conducted on a superficially volunteer basis , all sorts of mat - ters of business were taken in charge by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps that may be a sign of the future .

		The book is full of a feeling of change .

		`` Nothing will ever again be where it was before , '' `` All the old pretences , inter - ests , and disputations were finished now , '' `` This war cleans the slate , '' `` The age before the war an age already so remote , '' such expressions and phrases occur on almost every page .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	does not pretend really to study the effect that the war is going to have on civilization ; but he does study the effect that war has had in a number of typical cases , and that is quite as much as anyone can do just now .

		Not a study of the war itself , nor of the new possibilities of the war , is
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	's `` The Night Cometh , '' but a study of an old , old question in the light given by these new events .

		*
M. Bourget	PERSON	has been a distinguished figure in the recent literature of
France	LOCATION	, but in later days his work has not been of just the kind for which he was so much admired five and
twenty years ago	DATE	.

		In this book the Bourget of later years uses the forms and figures of earlier days , the days of `` Studies in the Psychology of Our Own Time , '' of `` The Disciple . ''

		Marsal the lame doctor , unable to go to the front , and attached to the
Clinique	ORGANIZATION	of Dr.
Ortegue	PERSON	, is the specta - tor and student of an example of the problem that has arisen millions of times in the
last two years	DATE	, the view that different men take of death , of the night that cometh when no man can work .

		Marsal himself is but the chronicler , the recorder of the psychical clinic , the observer who sets down his conclusions from the phenomena of one of the great experiments which the war prepares each day for the students of science , philosophy , and religion .

		He is little of a figure , reminding one of
Greslou	LOCATION	, the unhappy disciple who wrote in his cell at
Rennes	LOCATION	that study in psychology which so disproved the theories * It should be particularly noted that the translation is excellent , not only correct and French , but conveying a decided feeling of
M. Bourget	ORGANIZATION	's very special style .

		of his master .

		But Dr.
Ortegue	PERSON	reminds us of the old savant himself , the man of the days of
Taine	PERSON	, the man who held virtue and vice to be results , like sugar and vitriol .

		He believes in the things that are visible and tangible -LRB- he is a great surgeon -RRB- or to be otherwise perceived by the senses .

		But at the height of his career he finds himself a victim to cancer .

		To his hospital is brought Lieu - tenant LeGallic , a young man wounded in the head , a Christian of the deep and natural faith of his Breton family and ancestry .

		He is brought to the hospital from the battlefield where day by day he has lived with men who are proving their devotion to
France	LOCATION	with their lives .

		To each one the night comes .

		Marsal relates the circumstances , the progress of the doctor 's disease , the love and devotion of his charming wife , the steadfast faith of the soldier , and all the hundred events and incidents of the hospital tragedy .

		And he sums up the results .

		As a narrator he is earnest , as a student calm .

		These pages are a dissertation , an observation .

		`` Let us sum up , then , the facts the establishment of which results from this observation .

		They are to be grouped under two headings .

		I see , on the one hand , a superior man , Ortegue ... I see on the other , and this is the second case , a very simple man LeGallic , a man of action , but so modest in action . ''

		He states his conclusions concerning death .

		One could hardly desire a book more repre - sentative of the author .

		It embodies the later breadth of view of Bourget , with the earlier manner .

		The earlier view of
Bourget	LOCATION	, I believe , has had its day .

		The appearance of `` The Disciple '' will stand in the minds of those who look back on the recent years of French literature as the point which marks the end of the generation of Taine in the intel - lectual life of
France	LOCATION	.

		It made his mode of thought impossible , not perhaps in any way that Bourget conceived at the time , but in a way that seems plain to those who have studied the work of the last generation in
France	LOCATION	, the generation which is fighting the war .

		Dr.
Ortegue	PERSON	is a figure of older time ; LeGallic is the man of the hour , the man who has grown up since that time .

		He , like
Ernest Psichari	PERSON	,
Charles Peguy	PERSON	, and so many others , embodies the new spirit of
France	LOCATION	.

		Ortegue knew himself the soldier of Science ; LeGallic felt himself a soldier of the Cross .

		In the two figures there is much for the student of the
France	LOCATION	of our day .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		68 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A Filipino 's American sentiment regarding the plea for
Philippines	LOCATION	halts between the broad independence .

		path of expe -LRB- jiency and the strait and narrow way of principle .

		Unfortunately for both countries , the Americans , many of them , are so obsessed with the notion that they are doing the Filipinos good that they will not see any other side of the question , and therefore ground their expediency upon benevolence , confounding the forcing of their charity upon an unwilling people with principle .

		In such a case as this it would seem that the opinion of the Filipinos themselves ought to be the determining factor , and it is to put this opinion more plainly before the American people that Mr.
Maximo M. Kalaw	PERSON	has prepared `` The Case for the Filipinos '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , to quote the introductory words of Mr.
Manuel L. Quezon	PERSON	, resident commissioner from the
Philippines	LOCATION	, `` has been educated in public schools taught by American teachers who have endeavored to instil into the minds of their pupils the belief that it is the destiny of the Filipino people to remain forever under the control of the Govern - ment of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The result of this education is no more marked in Mr.
Kalaw	PERSON	's case than in that of every other pupil of his race so taught ; for it appears that there is nowhere among the native population a faction , large or small , that believes such a destiny is manifest or such control to be tolerated .

		This his book makes clear ; after nearly twenty years the Filipino peo - ple are as determined not to be governed against their will by a people alien in speech , law , and religion , in open violation of American govern - mental ideals themselves , as they were when they fired upon the invading American army in their war for independence against the land of the free and the home of the brave .

		The book is as remark - able for its omissions as for the clearness with which this position is set forth .

		It says nothing of the earlier points in controversy , whereby the imperialists sought to befuddle the issue .

		It points out , with dignity and restraint , that the
American Government	ORGANIZATION	has never considered the wishes of the Filipinos themselves , from the refusal to allow Sefior Agoncillo a voice in the framing of the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	down to the present .

		Written before the thirty renegade Democrats in the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	violated the platform of their party , it analyzes the bill thus defeated , shows its glaring defects and injustices , and yet hopes for its passage as granting at least a measure of inde - pendence .

		Every American who places principle before expediency should rejoice that such a book can emanate from one educated by Americans ; in spite of his teachers , the author has caught our own belief in freedom .

		A book of memories and musings .

		An unstudied sincerity not always easy to attain in writing of oneself marks the reminiscences of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	as recorded in `` Reveries over Childhood and Youth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is a worthy illustration of his own early-adopted literary creed , which is thus set down near the end of his narrative : '' If I can be sincere and make my language natural , and without becoming discursive , like a novelist , and so indiscreet and prosaic , I shall , if good luck or bad luck make my life interesting , be a great poet ; for it will be no longer a matter of literature at all . ''

		Yet this admirable frankness has the defects of its qualities : it has led in the present publica - tion to something that it might be harsh to call garrulity , but that nevertheless does lack some - what of the restraint and form and proportion characteristic of literature as distinguished from mere written utterance .

		Incidents and thoughts , significant and trivial , are set down , one after another , with running pen , all chopped into chap - ters without headings , and these in turn into loosely related paragraphs .

		But if the whole gives us a good and true picture of the writer , why should we complain ?

		In a sense there is nothing trivial in the narrative , since all is significant of the per - sonality behind the pen .

		We enjoy the unpremedi - tated delineation of Irish character and Irish scenes ; we glow with the writer 's scorn of mere rhetoric and are kindled with his enthusiasm for naturalness ; and we can not dissent when he says , `` We should write out our own thoughts in as nearly as possible the language we thought them in , as though in a letter to an intimate friend . ''

		But it always remains true that this very effort to achieve the natural and the unaffected has a baf - fling trick of leading one into unnaturalness and affectation .

		Where nature ends and art begins , who shall say ?

		The book is a notable one .

		Its passages of intimate spiritual autobiography are especially good .

		Lovers of Dickens of not too exact - ^ n S taste will find pleasure in Mr.
W. Walter Crotch	PERSON	's `` The Pageant of Dickens '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In this appreciation , Mr.
Crotch	PERSON	leads before our imagination the host of creatures from
Dickens	PERSON	's pen , at the same time classifying them and making entertaining and occa - sionally illuminating comment upon them and their author .

		There is no attempt at anything scholarly or scientific , but rather a review of these people , their doings and relations to each other , with lib - eral quotation from the writings .

		Along with this we are offered a somewhat extravagant praise of their creator that might provoke dissent on the part of less enthusiastic admirers .

		Mr.
Crotch	PERSON	finds in
Dickens	LOCATION	more solid qualities than are commonly admitted , calling him at once the equal of Shake - speare in tragedy and the very personification of `` the Comic Spirit who , Meredith tells us , hovers overhead , and , looking humanely malign upon our poor frailties and incongruities , casts an oblique light over unconscious humanity . ''

		Both
Meredith	PERSON	and
George Gissing	PERSON	are quoted so frequently and impartially that one might toss a coin to discover which of the two , next to
Dickens	PERSON	, is Mr.
Crotch	PERSON	's favorite novelist .

		That
Dickens	PERSON	was an arch - humanitarian most of us are prepared to believe , but when the present commentator claims for him
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 all the finest qualities of the humanist , the question arises as to whether he makes any distinction be - tween these much misused terms .

		It is perhaps invidious to call attention to the platitudes with which the book is crowded , for its appeal is only too obviously to those for whom platitudes are of sweet savour , who will not be piqued at being asked to swallow without a wry face the whole of Victorian economics , sociology , and philosophy , and who will give a willing ear to every good thing said of an author for whom they themselves have nothing but pleasant remembrance and praise .

		Oddly enough , Mr.
Crotch	PERSON	in his remarks about
Dickens	PERSON	's treatment of dogs omits to mention one of the most conspicuous and impossible of the
Dickens	PERSON	canines , `` Merrylegs '' in `` Hard Times , '' and his famous feat of announcing the death of his master .

		It is indeed noteworthy that of all the immense canvas which the great novelist left as his picture of
Victorian England	LOCATION	, the present author finds no single detail out of drawing , none that is not representative of life as it really is .

		Not even
Quilp	PERSON	is overdone .

		Despite its faults , however , Mr.
Crotch	PERSON	's book is one to give many an agreeable half - hour to the casual reader who has devoured all of
Dickens	PERSON	and wants more .

		It was a happy idea which inspired Professor
Robert Herndon Fife	PERSON	of
Wesleyan University	ORGANIZATION	to write `` The German Empire between Two Wars '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A knowledge of the history of
Germany	LOCATION	between
1870	DATE	and
1914	DATE	furnishes an admirable basis for the understanding of the present war , inasmuch as
Grermany	PERSON	has been the focal point of most of the great international controversies which are now being solved by blood and iron .

		Thus the present volume , while not a war-book strictly speaking , becomes most useful for a comprehension of the causes and setting of the great conflict .

		Though Professor
Fife	PERSON	is a neutral to the extent of not disclosing his ultimate feelings about the war , he is by no means colorless in the discussion of specific issues , and he is particularly emphatic in his ex - pressions of sympathy with the more democratic movements in German life and thought .

		The book is not so much a record of facts chronologically arranged as a description of conditions and ten - dencies .

		The main part deals with the foreign and internal policies of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		A very valuable concluding section is devoted to a consideration of
Germany	LOCATION	's municipal administration , her educa - tional system , and her newspapers .

		The entire work is not a rehash of others ' opinions but a record of the author 's own observations and experiences , maturely considered and attractively presented .

		A seer of vision * .

		To plain
John Smith	PERSON	, office clerk , the
Spirit of Understanding	ORGANIZATION	chooses to reveal itself all of a sudden , to the boundless astonishment arrd rapture of this otherwise undistinguished person ; and he proceeds , like the good husband he is , to communicate these revelations to his wife when he goes home at night to
Lonelyville	LOCATION	.

		`` The Case of
John Smith	PERSON	: His Heaven and His Hell '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Mrs.
Charles W. Wetmore	PERSON	, better known as
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	, sets forth , in the space of 244 pages , the whole `` course of cosmic history , '' as we are asked to believe , `` the wonders of the infinitely great and the infinitely minute , the growth and decay of worlds , the development of life , the formation of creeds , the error and evil and false ideals with which the world has battled . ''

		This Spirit of Understanding , otherwise called the Shining Lady , waits upon John somewhat as the Cumaean Sibyl gave herself to the guidance of JEneas , revealing things undreamt of by her disciple .

		It is an enlarging and inspiring revelation , disclosing the hidden possibilities in every human soul , awaken - ing us to a sense of our fabulously rich heritage , and nerving us for the attainment of goals hitherto but dimly visible to our myopic vision .

		In the course of her talks , which , as the story proceeds , are not confined to
John	PERSON	alone , the Shining Lady shows herself to be a monist , holding that matter and spirit `` are one and the same , and also a disbeliever in any first cause , any creative act ; for she explains that `` there was no need of a spirit or first cause to create matter , '' since `` the two always existed at the same time , and there was no act of creation at all . ''

		Rather deep water , this , for her ladyship ; but she shies at nothing , even making bold to elucidate the wherefore of war and the whereby it may be avoided .

		In depicting the enlightened course we shall follow in the better future , this wise person evinces a sadly ungram - matical preference for the auxiliary `` will '' where `` shall '' is meant .

		But such high discourse should not be scrutinized with the grammarian 's micro - scope .

		France from
1870	DATE	to the great war .

		In his `` History of the Third French Republic '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , Professor
C. H. C. Wright	PERSON	of
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity sketches the political history of
France	LOCATION	from
1870	DATE	to the outbreak of the present European war .

		The causes of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 , the government of the
National Defence	ORGANIZATION	and the reorganization under
Thiers	PERSON	, the framing of the Constitution of
1875	DATE	, the conflict between
MacMahon	PERSON	and the Republicans in
1877	DATE	which resulted in the downfall of the monarchist presi - dent and the triumph of the Republicans , the work of
Gambetta	PERSON	and
Jules Ferry	PERSON	, the
Boulanger	PERSON	crisis , the
Panama	LOCATION	scandal , the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affaire , the Colonial adventures of
France	LOCATION	, French foreign policy , relations with the Papacy and the dis - establishment of the church , are some of the more important events which the author reviews in turn .

		Although the present history of these forty-five years of stirring events is little more than a rapid sketch , all too brief to serve the purposes of the specialist , it is accurate and readable and contains much information which the general reader will find interesting and instructive .

		Necessarily it is largely a story of rapidly passing cabinets , for it is this more than anything else which distinguishes the parliamentary history of
France	LOCATION	from that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		While five ministries have governed 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	England since
1870	DATE	, some fifty-five have come and gone in
France	LOCATION	.

		But we must not judge the char - acter of cabinet government in
France	LOCATION	by this cir - cumstance , because cabinet changes in that country do not have the significance that they have in
England	LOCATION	.

		Often , indeed , they have no significance at all , for the downfall of a ministry does not mean -LRB- as it does in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- the passing of the govern - ment from one political party to another .

		Usually it involves merely a change of personnel , and may have no effect on the policy of the government .

		The truth is , there has been greater continuity of policy and political stability in
France	LOCATION	during the past fifteen years than there has been in
England	LOCATION	, because during all this period the government has been in the hands of the same party .

		The author 's division of his book into chapters according to the administrations of the presidents of
France	LOCATION	may be criticized on grounds of logic , since in
France	LOCATION	the president of the
Republic	ORGANIZATION	is little more than a figure-head , with no real power .

		One is hardly justified , therefore , in speaking of the `` adminis - trations '' of
Loubet	LOCATION	, Fallieres , and other presi - dents .

		A division according to ministries would be more logical .

		Psychology The widespread interest in psychol - .

		Sy as a subject for systematic study has brought about a number of expert contributions in this field .

		Two of the latest of these contributions are Professor TitchenerV ' A Beginner 's Psychology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and Professor
Pillsbury	ORGANIZATION	's `` Essentials of Psychol - ogy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In Professor
Titchener	PERSON	's little book , which replaces his `` Primer of Psychology , '' emphasis is placed upon principles and a right approach and understanding .

		The field is admi - rably surveyed , and a fair perspective of the topics is maintained .

		The volume is written with a mas - terly pen , from the ripe experience of years of teaching .

		It is rare to find an adept equally suc - cessful in preparing comprehensive manuals for the most advanced students and for the guidance of the novice .

		Professor
Pillsbury	ORGANIZATION	's book is more conventional and less distinctive ; but it reaches a high level of skill and insight in the several chapters .

		It is concerned with imparting informa - tion and clarifying conceptions , in intelligible terms .

		Text-books inevitably generate a generic similarity uninviting to the reviewer 's task ; but these little volumes make reasonable approxima - tion to an exception to this rule .

		Pre-war relations Of the many books written during of
England	LOCATION	the past two years on the genesis of and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		.

		> .

		* > .

		... the present world war , it is likely that only a very few will have permanent value .

		While most of the writers have no doubt honestly tried to base their conclusions on facts , in many cases only a relatively small body of facts has been studied and used ; and in the interpretation of these facts prejudice has too often taken the place of judicial thought .

		There are certain nota - ble exceptions , however , and among these Dr.
Bernadotte E. Schmitt	PERSON	's `` England and
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is likely to take high rank .

		Dr.
Schmitt	PERSON	proposes to give an account of the relations of
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	from the accession of Frederick the Great in
1740	DATE	to the outbreak of the European war in
1914	DATE	; but the discussion of these relations prior to 1870 is very slight , and adds but little to the value of the study .

		The work is not a narrative history ; it is rather a series of essays on such subjects as Ger - man expansion , the rivalry between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	as commercial , imperialistic , and naval powers , the formation of the
Triple Entente	ORGANIZATION	, the problem of
Morocco	LOCATION	, and many more .

		The author concludes that
England	LOCATION	did not want war and that all her diplomatic efforts were directed toward the maintenance of peace in
Europe	LOCATION	and the interests of the British Empire .

		The English people surely did not wish to fight for commercial advantages , as they believed with
Norman Angell	PERSON	that business and war are incompatible .

		In the quarrel that pre - ceded the war the English had their part ; but the author charges .

		Germany with the greater responsi - bility for this unfortunate situation .

		He also holds that while clumsy diplomats were in large part to blame for the unfriendly relations with which the century began , the moulders of public opinion , publicists like
Rohrbach	PERSON	and Delbriick , and chauvinistic journals like `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' were almost as much to blame .

		Dr.
Schmitt	PERSON	finds , however , that just prior to the outbreak of war the relations between these two peoples were im - proving , that they were no longer regarding each other with the earlier jealousy and fear , and that , if the crime of Serajevo had not created a des - perate situation in southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	, the old friendship between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	might have been speedily restored .

		The war is traced to the trouble in the
Balkans	LOCATION	and the clash between the ambitions of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	; but Ger - many , the author believes , could have done much more than she did do to restrain her belligerent ally .

		Dr.
Schmitt	PERSON	's book is written from the British point of view , but its tone is moderate , and the spirit of propagandism is wholly wanting .

		The probation system of dealing Reformatories .

		, , , r , , * , , , , without waiie .

		wlth law-breakers who are not hard - ened criminals costs
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, the first state to adopt it , less than
$ 150,000	MONEY	yearly , and it handles with much success more than one - half the total number of cases that under the old system would have meant so many commitments to cells .

		The penal machinery other than the proba - tionary part of it ` deals with less than one-half the cases and costs about
$ 2,000,000	MONEY	each year .

		Herein is one argument out of many for giving at least to the beginning criminal one more chance ; and this `` One More Chance '' is the subject and the title of a very humanly interesting series of chap - ters from the voluminous records of a
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts probation officer , Mr.
James P. Ramsay	PERSON	, editorially assisted by Mr.
Lewis E. MacBrayne	PERSON	, an unofficial investigator in the field of penology .

		To be exact , the title-page places the latter name first , and it is Mr.
MacBrayne	PERSON	who writes the preface and appears to be responsible for the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 form in which the entire narrative is presented .

		Encouragement and satisfaction speak in most of these stories of reclamation work among various sorts of human wreckage , or what threatened to become such ; but the pathos and the despair of hopeless failure are not wanting , as indeed was to have been expected .

		On the whole , however , the system is splendidly vindicated in these human documents , and it is no cause for surprise that its workings have so impressed the outside world as to lead to the adoption of similar methods all over our own country and beyond .

		The whole of
Scotland	LOCATION	now enjoys the benefits , economic and moral , resulting from the introduction , largely through Mr.
Ramsay	PERSON	's efforts , of a system modelled after that here referred to .

		The book is one of the `` Welfare Series '' published by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Michael F. Guyer	PERSON	* s `` Being Well-Born '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an admirable statement of the eugenic evidence , principles , argument , and applications .

		It gives the facts with great pre - cision and a confident scientific clearness .

		It is a book for the layman , but it is not written down to a `` popular '' level .

		The understanding of the data requires close attention ; and the subject deserves the effort .

		The composite effect of the story is impressive .

		It has the good effect of making the reader feel the importance of accurate foundations in microscopic beginnings and the technical refinements of the biologist .

		Equipped with the information of this book , the layman can - not but achieve an appreciation of the fundamental importance of the biological laboratory and its contributions to the social control which it estab - lishes .

		The book may do more , and impart a sense of responsibility to the legislative and civic con - science when it tries to regulate the forces with which human society must deal .

		The concluding chapters , devoted to the broader bearing of the principles of eugenics , are unusually forcible and clear .

		In view of the low price of the book , it is likely to be widely circulated and to become a standard introduction to a vital phase of public enlightenment .

		Lowell declares in one of his essays tna t a great Xerxes - .

		army of words will not march down to posterity , that the feat is to be accomplished only by the compact and well organized Ten Thousand .

		The case of
Robert Southey	PERSON	may be cited to substantiate this theory .

		Southey is dimly remembered as hav - ing been associated with
Coleridge	PERSON	in the
Pantisoc	LOCATION	- racy scheme , joined with
Wordsworth	PERSON	in a retire - ment to the English lake country as well as in a reaction to religious and political conservatism , and pilloried by
Byron	PERSON	in `` The Vision of Judg - ment '' and `` Don Juan . ''

		Of his narrative poems none are read nowadays , and of his shorter pieces but two his description of the falls of Lodore and his glimpse at the battle of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	through the eyes of old Kaspar , who knew only that '' 't was a famous victory . ''

		As a prose writer he is remem - bered scarcely at all except through his `` Life of Nelson '' ; his tale of the three bears is thought of as a piece of folk-lore .

		Yet he was a prolific writer ; it is estimated that his collected works would fill about two hundred octavo volumes .

		Only , his works have never been collected , confident though he was that they would be .

		Their bulk is too great for that , their level of attainment not high enough .

		Scholars have known , however , that they contain articles and passages of considerable value , as we might indeed expect from the owner of so magnificent a private library and from so persistent a contributor to `` The Quarterly Review . ''

		The need has been for some one to sep - arate the wheat from the chaff .

		This task has at last been performed by Dr.
Jacob Zeitlin	PERSON	, of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, whose collection of `` Select Prose of
Robert Southey	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains nearly four hundred pages of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's most read - able and significant prose .

		It is introduced by a scholarly analysis of his ideas , methods , and style .

		The volume makes accessible a writer who has been too much ignored .

		Southey always wrote fluently , sometimes with genuine power .

		It is a pity that the volume does not include an excerpt from the `` Life of Nelson '' or any specimens from the two valuable collections of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's letters .

		Antiquated In an age that promises long life wtfvi'uf * th * on ty to tne individual , city , or nation that can furnish the bigger gun or the more spectacular `` preparedness '' parade , there is something anomalous in the simultaneous publication of two new editions of the quaint dis - courses on long and sober living by
Luigi Cornaro	PERSON	, the Venetian centenarian of the sixteenth century .

		The one , `` Discourses on the Sober Life '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , is a paraphrased and modernized version ; the other , `` The Art of Living Long '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is a more literal translation that aims to preserve the spirit of the original .

		After lauding temperance and sobriety and stating clearly how to gain and maintain good health ,
Cornaro	PERSON	gives his reasons for wanting to live to a ripe old age .

		Foremost among these is the desire to do service to his country , and this is the good old-fashioned man - ner in which he proposes to `` take his own part '' : `` Oh , what a glorious amusement !

		in which I find infinite delight , as I thereby show her -LSB-
Venice	LOCATION	-RSB- the means of improving her important estuary or harbor beyond the possibility of its filling for thousands of years to come ; so as to secure to
Venice	LOCATION	her surprising and miraculous title of a maiden city , as she really is , and the only one in the whole world : .

		.

		of showing this maid and queen in what manner she may abound with pro- visions , by improving large tracts of land , as well marshes as barren sands , to great profit ... of showing how
Venice	LOCATION	, though already so strong as to be in a manner impregnable , may be rendered still stronger ; and , though extremely beautiful , may still increase in beauty ; though rich , may acquire more wealth , and may be made to enjoy better air , though her air is excellent .

		These three amusements , all arising from the idea of public utility , I enjoy in the highest degree . ''

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	The first
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	once said , `` I think Bishop of that I would rather have written a great biography than a great book of any sort , as I would rather have painted a great portrait than any other kind of picture . ''

		This is declared to be his own literary ambition by Bishop
Charles H. Brent	PERSON	in prefacing his biog - raphy of the late
Henry Yates Satterlee	PERSON	, first Bishop of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		`` A Master Builder '' he names the book , with sub-title explaining that it is `` the Life and Letters '' of Bishop
Satterlee	PERSON	.

		A high ideal has inspired the author 's labors , and he portrays for us an attractive , a devoted , a lovable personality in him who for more than forty years gave himself to his chosen work as a minister of religion , and for twelve of those years held the high office to which he was elected in
1895	DATE	.

		A peculiar fitness attends the choice of his biographer , as Bishop Brent was himself called with insistent urgency to fill the place left vacant by his friend 's death in
1908	DATE	.

		But his own duties in
the Philippines	LOCATION	seem to have outweighed all other claims .

		The book is well illustrated and indexed .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		All about the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	may be learned agreeably and in a short time from the handsome illustrated `` Handbook '' issued at the modest price of
ten cents	MONEY	by the library itself .

		The splendid Central Building of course claims first place and most space in this useful guide ; but the branches and the travelling libraries and the other adjuncts to the system are also men - tioned .

		Especially informing is the ten-page `` Historical Sketch '' near the end .

		Two hundred and ninety-nine short stories by modern American , English , French , German , and other writers are indexed in `` A List of Short Stories '' compiled by Mr.
F. K. W. Drury	PERSON	, assist - ant librarian of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, who invites suggestions as to the three-hundredth story to round out the list .

		The pamphlet appears as an issue of the Bulletin of the
Illinois Association of Teachers of English	ORGANIZATION	, and is distributed by the above-named library .

		The classification by lan - guages places
Jokai	PERSON	, conveniently but not quite accurately , among `` the Russian and other Slavic . ''

		Care and judgment seem to have guided the selec - tion , but every lover of short stories will like to reconstruct it , omitting and adding to suit his own taste .

		The Rev.
David Morton	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, who died eighteen years ago at the age of sixty-five , after more than forty years of notable work in the Methodist Epis - copal Church , South , is the subject of a biography by Bishop
Elijah Embree Hoss	PERSON	, of the same church .

		Before he was quite twenty-one , Mr.
Morton	PERSON	became an itinerant preacher ; at thirty - one he was elected President of the
Russellville Academy	LOCATION	for Girls ; at forty he was made a Pre - siding Elder ; and nine years later he entered upon the Church Extension work to which his fame is largely due .

		As one of bis friends has said of him , he was a child of nature , unaffected , unsophisticated , impatient of sham and pretence .

		He loved `` nature in her visible forms , '' and he loved naturalness in men and women .

		The book , attractive in style and well illustrated , is issued by the
Publishing House	ORGANIZATION	of the Methodist Epis - copal Church , South ,
Nashville	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		The sixth issue of `` The American Year Book , '' edited by Mr.
Francis G. Wickware	PERSON	, has recently been issued by Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		It forms a record of events and progress for the year
1915	DATE	, its material being arranged under thirty-three departments , in which are grouped articles on related subjects .

		`` The American Year Book '' holds an established place among reference books , and comment on its numerous excellences , sus - tained from year to year , is superfluous .

		The introductory sentences of the article on
American History	ORGANIZATION	reveal the far-reaching effect of the Great War : `` In ways unforeseen and to an extent undreamed of a year ago , every element of Amer - ican life has felt the influence of the struggle .

		The pages of this volume exhibit the amazing diversity of its effects , which in many directions have been of profound and permanent impor - tance . ''

		In the first edition , published four years ago , Mr.
Ernest F. Henderson	PERSON	's `` Short History of
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- closed with the assump - tion of the imperial crown in the palace of
Versailles	LOCATION	on
January 18 , 1871	DATE	.

		Now reissued , the two volumes contain additional chapters on events and progress in
Germany	LOCATION	since that date .

		As was pointed out in these columns -LRB-
July 1 , 1902	DATE	-RRB- when the work first appeared , the narrative deals with political matters rather to the neglect of a discus - sion of the country 's Kulturgeschichte ; but the new material makes up in part for this deficiency by its emphasis on recent economic and social advance - ment .

		Indeed , after reading the new chapters , one is more than ready to agree with the author when he remarks : `` It has been said of the Roman Catholic church that , with its sacraments and its required duties , it watches over men from the cradle to the grave .

		The same is true of the German Empire . ''

		Dr.
William Healy	PERSON	, whose work in the
Juvenile Court of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is deservedly well known , is the author of a small volume entitled `` Honesty : A Study of the Causes and Treatment of Dishonesty among Children '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a practical treatise , free from the misleading sim - plicity of moral suasion , and protected by a sense of the complexity of the influences which surround the youthful offender in the complex currents of the modern city .

		The straight and narrow path is ever harder to find and tread amid the perplex - ing yet inviting mazes of the city street and the crowd on pleasure bent .

		Temptation takes new forms , and the old rules fail to hold .

		The book is a valuable guide for the social worker .

		Its basis is empirical , which is proper for the prac - tical bent of the volume .

		It does not exaggerate the complexity of youth , or minimize the efficiency of the ten commandments .

		It faces the situation in an enlightening and sympathetic effort to ` deal wisely with the frailties of human nature .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 73 NOTES `` Quaker Born , '' a romance of the Great War by Mr.
Ian C. Hannah	PERSON	, is announced for Septem - ber publication by Mr.

George Heath Viner	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness , Jr.	PERSON	, is at work on `` King

Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, '' compiled by Mr.
A. P. Webb	PERSON	, will soon be issued in a handsomely printed limited edition by the
Torch Press Book Shop	ORGANIZATION	, of Cedar Rapids , |
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		Among early publications expected from Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	is Professor
R. A. Gregory	PERSON	's new book , `` Discovery ; or , The Spirit and
Service of Science	ORGANIZATION	, '' pointing out the value and nobility of scientific work .

		`` From Nature Forward '' by
Harriet Doan Prentiss	PERSON	, a volume outlining a system of psycho - logical reform to meet the nervous strain of mod - ern life , is announced for immediate issue by Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	.

		Three volumes to be added to the `` New Poetry Series '' within the next two or three months are `` Mothers and Men '' by Mr.
H. T. Pulsifer	PERSON	, and new collections of verse by
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	and
Anna Hempstead Branch	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A Political and Social History of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' covering the period from
1500	DATE	to
1915	DATE	, has been written by Professor
Carlton Hayes	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and will be published this month , in two volumes , by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Helen '' by Mr.
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, `` The Wall Street Girl '' by Mr.
Frederick Orin Bartlett	PERSON	, and `` Filling His Own Shoes '' by Mr.
Henry C. Rowland	PERSON	, are three novels which
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	expect to issue early in the autumn .

		Two interesting volumes to be issued by the
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	during the early Fall season are '' The Spiritual Interpretation of His - tory '' by Dean
Shailer Mathews	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and `` Personality in German Litera - ture '' by Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Near the end of
August	DATE	Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	expect to issue a volume on Handel by
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	.

		The first half of the volume deals with the life of the composer ; the second part , dealing with his work , places as much emphasis on
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's operas and his instrumental works as on his oratorios .

		Among other novels to be issued in the autumn by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	are `` The Cab of the Sleeping Horse '' by Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, '' Twenty-Thr ** Minutes to Five '' bv Mrs.
Anna Katherine Green	PERSON	, `` The Breath of the ' Dragon '' by Mr.
A. H. Fitch	PERSON	, and `` Desmond 's Daughter '' by
Miss Maud Diver	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Life and Letters of Lady
Dorothy Nevill	PERSON	, '' edited by her son , which is now in preparation , will form both a biography and autobiography , con - taining many new reminiscences and character studies from Lady
Dorothy	PERSON	's pen .

		The corre - spondence includes a selection of hitherto unpub - lished letters from her circle of friends .

		Professor
L. T. Hobhouse	PERSON	has nearly ready a new book entitled `` Questions of War and Peace , '' discussing , in the form of dialogues , such prob - lems as the fundamental justification of the war and the effect of the struggle upon democracy .

		To the dialogues is added an address on the pos - sibility of effecting some form of international organization to prevent future catastrophes .

		`` The Founding of Spanish
California	LOCATION	: The Northwestward Expansion of
New Spain	LOCATION	,
1687	DATE	-
1783	DATE	, '' is the title of a forthcoming work by Professor
Charles E. Chapman	PERSON	, of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		Based almost wholly on hitherto unused materials , the work tends to show that the history of
California	LOCATION	is not only interesting of itself , but that it is also important in the devel - opment of the nation .

		Several important biographies are included in the preliminary autumn announcement list of
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among others are Mr.
Frank Sanborn	PERSON	's `` Life of Thoreau , '' Mr.
John Spencer Clark	PERSON	's `` Life of
John Fiske	PERSON	, '' and Hon.
Albert J. Beveridge	PERSON	's `` Life of

Thomas Campion	PERSON	and the Art of English poetry . ''

		The new book is entitled `` Literature in
Ireland	LOCATION	: Studies Irish and

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	We learn by way of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' that the
Harvard College Library	ORGANIZATION	has lately come into possession of a remarkable collection of English historical broadsides and proclamations printed between
1626	DATE	and
1700	DATE	.

		The collection has been formed during the
past quarter	DATE	of a century by a well-known collector , and was sold on his behalf to
Harvard	LOCATION	by
Messrs. Dobell	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	.

		The only collections to rival that of
Harvard	LOCATION	were those of
Colonel F. Grant	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
J. E. Hodgkin	PERSON	-LRB- both now dispersed -RRB- , and that in the possession of Lord
Crawford	PERSON	.

		There are nearly eight hundred separate pieces .

		Four relate to
Nell Gwynne	PERSON	and the Duchess of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	; a large and very val - uable collection concerns the
Duke of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	and the rising in the West of
England	LOCATION	, and an even more wonderful series concerns the
Rump Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, among which are many of a satirical character .

		Another extraordinary series printed in
1659	DATE	deals with the affairs leading up to the Restoration of the
Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are also various ordinances issued by the Royalists and by the
Commonwealth Parliaments	ORGANIZATION	, and a large num - ber concerning the doings of
Charles I.	PERSON	during the most eventful period of his history .

		Accounts of fires form another feature of the collection .

EMILE FAGUET	PERSON	.

		In the recent death of
Emile Faguet	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	has lost one of her most distinguished men of letters .

		As the Professor of French Poetry at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, as a literary critic , as a member of the Academy , he exerted a wide - spread influence both in his own country and abroad .

		Students of French literature have long been familiar with his four volumes of remarkable essays , entitled `` Literary Studies , '' devoted to the representative French writers of the last four centuries , while another series , `` Statesmen and Moralists of the XIX Cen - tury '' is almost as well known .

		For many years , as dramatic critic of `` le Journal des Debats , '' he brought to the discussion of mod - ern drama a rare gift of analysis and appre - ciation .

		In more recent years he has written extensively on social and political questions .

		His entire work has been characterized by those typical French qualities of logic , clarity of thought , and brilliancy of style .

		As a critic
Faguet	ORGANIZATION	's primary object was analysis and exposition .

		His ability to dis - sect a given writer 's work , to discover funda - mental ideas , to determine upon the `` master faculty '' has been equalled only by
Taine	PERSON	.

		He held that the critic should be so objective and impartial as to be able to judge his own work .

		Fortunately he had an opportunity to put this theory to the test in his own case .

		He contrib - uted to the `` History of French Literature , '' edited by
M. Petit de Julleville	ORGANIZATION	and written by a group of French scholars , the article on criticism from
1850	DATE	to
1900	DATE	and assigned to himself the position which he will undoubt - edly occupy in the history of criticism .

		In his method , Faguet resembled , as
M. Victor Giraud	PERSON	has aptly remarked , a skilful watch - maker , who carefully takes the watch apart and puts it together again in order to under - stand its mechanism .

		By this process of analysis and synthesis , he has given us a defi - nite impression of the claim a writer may have upon our attention .

		Because of his mis - trust of too great generalization , he limited himself almost exclusively to the discussion of individuals rather than of periods and movements .

		He wrote for students of liter - ature , especially the young men of the French universities , and sought to arouse their inter - est to the point of desiring a more extensive knowledge of the subject , which would allow 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	them to formulate their own ideas and opin - ions .

		The dramatic critic , as he has told us , has attained his goal when he has induced the public to think about and discuss a given play and especially to go to see it , `` Initiation into Literature , '' the title of one of his volumes , summarizes the greater part of his work .

		His `` Literary Studies '' offers excellent short introductions to a more detailed study of the representative French writers .

		Faguet reckoned literary values chiefly in terms of ideas .

		The poet 's monumentum acre perennius must have a foundation of sound thought .

		Mere beauty of form can not preserve from oblivion what intellectually is of slight importance .


Theophile Gautier	PERSON	, for example , in whom he found a complete absence of ideas , will be unknown in fifty years , except to a few connoisseurs of poetry .

		While Faguet often failed to understand the imaginative writer , he was at his best with the thinkers and philosophers of literature such as
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	,
Bayle	PERSON	, and
Montesquieu	LOCATION	.

		His interest in ideas gradually led him from purely literary to social and political ques - tions .

		From a literary study of the XVIII century he turned to `` La Politique comparee de
Montesquieu	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	et Voltaire '' and from the poets and novelists of the last cen - tury to the `` Statesmen and Moralists of the XIX Century . ''

		He has left us a small volume on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	and a popular introduction to the study of philosophy .

		He entered into the discussion of modern questions in `` Liberal - ism , '' `` Political Questions , '' and `` Feminism . ''

		His best known work of a non-literary charac - ter , `` The Cult of Incompetence , '' attacks the inefficiency of democracy .

		Although an `` old liberal , '' as he called himself , he had
Kenan	PERSON	's mistrust of democracies .

		The old battle cry , `` Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , '' he held to be a contradiction in itself and fearlessly main - tained that an aristocracy chosen by some intelligent method of selection and distin - guished by its responsibilities rather than its privileges is the sine qua non of good govern - ment .

		Here as in his literary criticism we meet the same power of analysis and exposi - tion , the same clear thinking , and above all the ability to understand a point of view rad - ically different from his own .

		Although he claimed to be a disciple of
Taine	PERSON	, his fear of dogmatism saved him from the tyranny of a rigid system .

		Systems seemed to him too subjective .

		He agreed with Brunetiere that the critic by confining him - self strictly to criticism would retain that necessary impartiality which he might lose , if he entered the field of creative literature .

		Although undogmatic , he did not , as he accused Sainte-Beuve of doing , avoid a deci - sion as to the merits or general worth of a writer .

		He had the somewhat vague criterion of common sense and still believed in what
Boileau	PERSON	and the XVII century called ` la raison . '

		His judgments were conservative and in accordance with the best literary traditions .

		He could not agree with
Michelet	PERSON	that the XVIII century was the Golden Age .

		For him the century of
Rousseau	PERSON	and Voltaire was neither Christian nor French .

		He aided Brunetiere in the rehabilitation of the XVII century and in his article in the `` Cambridge Modern History '' entitled `` The XVII Cen - tury Literature and its European Influence '' declared that `` in no other period have the distinguishing characteristics of French intel - lect and genius method , logical sequence of ideas , and lucidity of style been so con - spicuous . ''

		In spite of many excellent qualities ,
Faguet	ORGANIZATION	's criticism has grave defects .

		There is a lack of breadth and profundity .

		He con - tributed nothing to the theory of criticism .

		His desire for clearness sometimes led him to sacrifice truth to simplification and to put too much sequence into a poet 's ideas .

		Taine made the same mistake when he tried to fit Shakespeare into his system of race and envi - ronment .

		Faguet failed to realize the impor - tance of the introduction of scientific methods into the study of literature .

		The contributions which
M. Lanson	PERSON	and the young men who have been trained by him have made to our knowledge of literary history can not be ignored by the critic of to-day .

		Faguet 's hatred of pedantry caused him to view with suspicion the increase of `` fichomanie , '' the card-cataloging of literature .

		He should have seen that , whatever the dangers of these methods in other countries , the instinctive appreciation of the Frenchman will prevent the study of literature from degenerating into an accumulation of statistics .

		The work of both
M. Lanson	PERSON	and
M. Bedier	PERSON	is quite suffi - cient to prove that
Faguet	ORGANIZATION	's fears in this mat - ter were not justified .

		Faguet has also been guilty of `` a certain intellectual incontinence . ''

		He confessed to have written , although not necessarily published , three or four volumes a year .

		At his death he was undoubtedly the most voluminous writer of his age in
France	LOCATION	.

		One of his friends has recently asked the ques - tion : '' Who has read all his books ? ''

		Faguet of late has too frequently repeated himself and has often explained the obvious .

		His style is clear and brilliant , though somewhat free and unconventional .

		It lacks the grace and charm of
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	or
Anatole France	LOCATION	, and the vigor of Brunetiere .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 85 However he possessed a remarkable felicity of phrase and has several times matched Sainte-Beuve ?

		s famous description of Cha - teaubriand , `` an Epicurean with a Catholic imagination . ''

		Faguet 's summary of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, `` un chaos d'idees claires , '' has become quite as well known .

		His pages are filled with these apt characterizations .

		Montaigne is `` le medeein de 1 ` ame '' who acted as the `` literary father-confessor of the XVII century . ''

		Balzac has `` un temperament d ` artiste avec 1 `` esprit d'un commis-voyageur , '' and
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	is `` un esprit europeen dans une ame f rancaise . ''

		His style , whatever its faults may be , never fails to interest us and to hold our attention .

		The ultimate position of Faguet in the his - tory of French criticism will not be of much importance .

		Since the creation of modern French criticism by Sainte-Beuve , who still remains the master , the prominent critics have made some definite contribution to what he bequeathed us .

		Taine endeavored to place criticism on a strictly scientific basis , to reduce Sainte-Beuve 's art to a science .

		Brunetiere applied Darwinism to the study of literature in his theories of the evolution of literary genres .

		Even the now forgotten
Hennequin	PERSON	made an original attempt to unite aesthetics and psychology in his `` aesthopsy - chology . ''

		Lemaitre and
Anatole France	LOCATION	, approaching criticism from a point of view entirely different from that of their predeces - sors , will always be identified with the intro - duction of impressionism into criticism .

		Faguet has left us no theory by which we may perpetuate his name , no disciples to carry on his work .

		We shall always admire the keen interest which he evinced in bringing us to the study of ideas both new and old .

		He will be classed with those lesser men of French criticism of the
last century	DATE	,
Vinet	PERSON	,
Scherer	PERSON	,
Montegut	LOCATION	, and many others , who have upheld the excellent reputation of criticism in
France	LOCATION	and who in other lands , where the standards of criticism are not as high , might have attained greater fame .

		JAMES
F. MASON	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMEXT .

		RABINDRANATH TAGORE FINDS that the j new
Japan	LOCATION	has sold her birthright for a mess of pottage .

		From burial in feudalism and the meditations of Buddah .

		she has been swept into the whirlpool of modern civiliza - tion , and now being satisfied with externals she lives an external life and nothing else .

		Her crowds jostle you , rapidly take note of i your face , offer their faces to you for obser - vation , and pass on .

		Unessentials are satis - fying because they can be obtained so easily and dropped so easily .

		It is a comfort to us young and slandered Americans sometimes to see the philosophic scourge laid on the backs of other people .

		One is tempted to quote in this connection : Suave , mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis , e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem .

		However , perhaps there is great truth in
Tagore	LOCATION	's observations made in his address at
Osaka	LOCATION	to the merchants of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		In watch - ing others swimming in the materialistic sea , let us look out for the waves ourselves .

		In the autumn the famous poet comes to
America	LOCATION	, where he will likewise hold the mir - ror up to nature after he has finished with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		While here , he will deliver a series of eighteen lectures at some of the leading American universities .

		THE
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION	ORGANIZATION	'S meeting in
New York City	LOCATION	during the first part of
July	DATE	proved interesting in many ways .

		Dr.
P. P. Claxton	PERSON	,
Federal Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, delivered an address in which he suggested that perhaps an efficient way to discover the best system of education for the American child was for the government , at its own expense , to establish educational experi - mental stations where many or all systems might be given due trial , records kept of them in the using , and also records of the results evident in the after life of the various pupils experimented upon .

		`` If a million dol - lars were at the disposal of the
National Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	I would select several good schools in various parts of the country that would try the experiments that seem worth trying through a period of years .

		To spend
Government	ORGANIZATION	money on such an under - taking for a short time would be to waste the money without learning anything that could be depended upon .

		It should run through several generations of the school and through the administrations of several teachers to eliminate from the result all accidents of personalities .

		The test would not be entirely complete until the children experimented upon had grown up and shown the results of their schooling . ''

		Such are his words .

		They have a ringing sound ; but why not consider the poor child already the subject of over - experimentation .

		Besides after all is it not these personalities alone which make any education education ?

		Put before a child a course of great and glowing personalities , a book of `` Plutarch 's Lives '' or an ``
Autobi	PERSON	-
86	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	ography of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, '' and under the direction of a live personality he must be educated .

		We now and then unfortunately forget this in all our haste to shine `` in the spangles of science . ''

		However , due con - sideration ought to be given the
Federal Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	's measured words .

		They bespeak a determination to build solidly and from within ... `` THE NATION '' PUTS ITS FINGER on the spot which hurts in contemporary life : the family life is fast disappearing or is gone .

		The automobile and cinametograph , devices for fast and exhilarating entertainment , devices which have disrupted family gather - ings at evening among both rich and poor , have quite abolished the old reading circles which in recent generations proved so great a bond of union and education in the home .

		The germ of speed , when once in the blood , has proved almost ineradicable .

		It is the very bacillus which corrupted the Romans .

		IN THIS YEAR OF THE SHAKESPEARE TERCEN - TENARY it is well to call to mind some of those old reading hours , when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	proved to be the chiefest author of the evening .

		In the last two centuries , most prominent among those who enabled our most English poet to become more English , was
Thomas Bowdler	PERSON	, editor of the first `` Family Edition '' of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		This somewhat noto - rious gentleman , physician , and editor , was born at
Ashley	LOCATION	, near Bath , on
July 11 , 1754	DATE	.

		After his university years at St. An - drew 's and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and four years of travel , he settled in
London	LOCATION	, where he became a great friend of the `` Bluestockings '' and other wits of the day who gathered at the house of the brilliant Mrs.
Montague	PERSON	, wife of the wealthy and prominent son of Lady
Mary Wortley Montague	PERSON	.

		He was an energetic philanthropist and prison-worker ; and in
1818	DATE	published the edition which has given his name to the language .

		The verb `` to bowdlerize , '' first known to occur in
General Perronet Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's `` Letters of a Represen - tative to his Constituents , ''
1836	DATE	, signifies `` to expurgate by omitting or modifying words or passages considered indelicate or offen - sive , '' and is associated with false squeamish - ness or x pruriency .

		However , this obloquy is perhaps undeserved ; for Dr.
Bowdler	PERSON	was at a noble task : bringing
Shakespeare	PERSON	to the youths of his country .

		Swinburne was right in saying that `` nobody ever did better ser - vice to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	than the man who made it possible to put him in the hands of intelli - gent and imaginative children . ''

		THE TWO SAMUEL BUTLERS have a way of getting themselves tangled up together in probably more minds than a few .

		Every one knows that one
Samuel Butler	PERSON	wrote
Hudi	PERSON	- bras , and many have heard of a second
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Butler	PERSON	who wrote `` Erewhon , '' while the fact that this younger
Butler	PERSON	was the grand - son of still another of the same name may or may not help to clarify the situation .

		And recently there has been report of the discon - tinuance of the annual meetings of the
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Butler Society	ORGANIZATION	, and , to add to the general bewilderment , the newspapers and literary reviews are just now advertising `` The Way of All Flesh , '' by
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, which might implant in some careless minds the notion of a living popular author thus named .

		Certain points of resemblance , with many more of difference , in the two
Samuel Butlers	PERSON	do not , on the whole , very much assist the man in the street to keep before him a clear - cut image of Samuel senior and one of
Sam	PERSON	- uel junior .

		Perhaps the best plan in all this vexatious snarl is to open one 's `` Britannica '' or other modern reference book and try to puzzle it out once for all .

		EDGAR
ALLAN POE	PERSON	HAS RECENTLY APPEARED in a complete edition of five volumes , `` The National Library '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Critics have been in doubt whether to class Poe as an immortal or a charlatan .


Henry James	PERSON	calls his critical ability `` the most complete speci - men of provincialism ever prepared for the edification of man '' ;
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	calls him `` the greatest journalistic critic of his times , '' a poet whose failures were more iridescent than the most complete successes of Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		Between such limits ,
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	may surely find a resting place indisputably his own .

		Truly , critics never agree .

		THE MEMORY OF
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE	PERSON	is soon to receive a belated tribute .

		Salem has neglected her illustrious citizen too long ; and now a memorial association composed of prominent men of letters , both
Ameri	PERSON	- can and English , is taking steps to render more enduring the fame of the great novelist .

		The devastating fire in Salem compelled work on similar lines to be abandoned until re - cently .


Bela L. Pratt	PERSON	, sculptor , is to do the proposed statue when the funds are gathered .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 87 It should be indeed an honor to commemorate the man who perhaps has done as much as any single author to extend the name of American literature beyond its own coasts .

		A SEVERE YOUNG POET , severe with that | uncompromising severity characteristic of j youth -LRB- youth that has most of its sins still in ' .

		the future -RRB- , has been castigating his univer - sity , his class , and his contemporaries gener - ally .

		Mr.
Robert Cutler	PERSON	, class poet at Har - vard , laments the idleness of wasted college days , and upbraids his Alma Mater for hav - ing waxed corpulent in body and dwindled in | soul , for having `` grown and grown in disre - gard of quality . ''

		A characteristic stanza j from this young poet-reformer , whom we shall ' hope to hear from again in the near future | when he shall have added more of the con - j structive element to his criticism , is the fol - lowing : The measure of all things is quality .

		Four walls have never made a college yet , And never shall : though student company From distant ends of earth together met Bepays unnumbered times its foster debt , Yet who can say in how true coin or whenf The dullard legion is not worthy yet To supersede the bright , industrious ten .

		Give us a university of minds , not men !

		A DELEGATION OF FRENCH EDUCATORS re - cently visited the
University of Leeds	ORGANIZATION	, in order to further the union of the French and British nations .

		Professor
Gentil	PERSON	, professor of petrography at the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, addressed the gathering in French , offering the hope that the universities would seal the friendships which their brothers in arms had already cemented on the battlefield .

		After the war a terrible calamity will strike both nations even more poignantly than now : the decimation of its youth .

		Those universities in either country which have answered so nobly the call of their land 's need
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	has given 8,500 men to the enlistment rolls and
Cambridge	LOCATION	8,850 will have it on their hands to recover the educational status of their respective nations , and in the face of unprepared and poverty-stricken students there will be the more insurmountable need of enough young instructors to do the work .

		Already many of the more vigorous teachers have gone to the front , and the task of those who are left is Herculean .

		Always and every - where men who are overworked and under - paid , they now are forced to double their exertions in order to fill up the gaps left by their absent colleagues and to adjust their slender incomes to the new economic condi - tions .

		After the war , particularly in the
British Isles	LOCATION	, the panic of these economic changes will stir up all departments of the population to ' clamor for changes in that edu - cational system which has for so many centu - ries cultivated English gentlemen and schol - ars in order to make way for a new school - ing , a schooling in terms of individual and national practicality .

		In the apotheosis of carpentry and ditch-digging , there will be great danger of forgetting that `` material efficiency is only a small part of the ends of education and any attempt to place it at the forefront of concern can not fail of condem - nation from those who are able to take a long view on such matters . ''

		It is an axiom that a broadly cultivated man , a man who knows the past and the present , their tendencies , goods , and dangers ; a man , who To his native center fast , Shall into Future fuse the Past , And the world 's flowing fates into his own mould recast ; is of more value to his country than the man who only knows his particular trade or hobby .

		The one can rise to any occasion sooner or later , while the other if he move beyond his sphere is worthless .

		This happy attempt at closer union between the French and British universities ought to mean much for better balance in the days of post-bellum reorgani - zation .

		THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS has recently been formally incorpo - rated by act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has become a national institution , and one of which we may be proud .

		Too long have American letters languished for recognition .

		88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	THE DEATH OF
JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY	PERSON	,
July 22 , 1916	DATE	, calls to mind how time pro- gresses .

		Most of us had almost considered the venerable poet as one of the long-past dead rather than as one of the vibrant and gesticu - lating living , so long had it been since we had heard his voice , so long since the tenor of his verse had reflected the moving spirit of his day .

		Yet his pleasant manners and sweet and humble characterizations , his humorous sketches , and whimsical simplicity of observa - tion won him a secure place as `` the poet of the heart and home . ''

		His songs were grate - ful in the midst of much mere weariness and prettiness , and although theirs was not the superabundant exuberance which casts its energies around the planets or man in his titanic and creative mode , still they were delightfully sincere and forgiving .

		Truly , the whole nation does unite in President
Wilson	PERSON	's message of condolence with the family of the deceased poet .

		He was one who had no enemies , deserving none .

		WHEN A NEW AND PROMISING PLAYWRIGHT appears before the public the public should be most intensely grateful , but how much more so when a dramatist appears .

		Bernt Lie was known exclusively as a novelist till recently ; now in a most worthy fashion he receives the mantle of Ibsen in giving forth `` En Racekamp , '' a three-act play of subtle tragedy .

		This sombre drama this `` race - feud , '' to render in English its Norwegian title is in words what that other vivid study of Finnish psychology , `` The Finlandia '' of Sibellius , is in music .

		It is hard to say which is the more photographic .

		A family of feudal standing , named
Skram	PERSON	, has for gen - erations owned a rich copper mine in
North Norway	LOCATION	, itself among an alien Turanian pop - ulation .

		The great
Peter	PERSON	, grandfather of the present owner , ruled his principality with a heavy hand , and lived in greatest lux - ury , and ruthlessness ; but on his death every - thing went to ruin .


Peter Skram	PERSON	, the second , returns after some years with his young wife ,
Ingeborg	PERSON	, and determines to reopen the mine .

		Marja-Nilas , the Finnish overseer of her husband 's property , poisons her contentment with his extracts from the family history .

		Unconscious of his steward 's infidelity , Skram confidently undertakes to work the digging on a more humane basis than his grandfather , and employs the assist - ance of a young southland engineer ,
Kristian	PERSON	Sending .

		Meanwhile , through connivance , the governor of the province arrives , and before this representative of civilized law the Finns protest against the reopening of the mines and the iniquities of a former rule .

		Skram becomes so infuriated that he almost assaults the ringleader of the natives .

		The protests of the Finns are in vain ; the great hall of the mine is prepared for dynamiting .

		Then the party from the manor comes to inspect the work .

		Ingeborg and Sending , old friends , are left alone , and they can not resist each other .

		Marja-Nilas , whom when young , the Great
Peter	PERSON	had robbed of a woman 's love , throws off the mask of his hatred for the race of Skram , and conducts the second
Peter	PERSON	to a spot where he can see the two lovers .

		A struggle ensues between the tor - mented husband and the goading overseer ; a lamp is upset ; the fuse is fired ; and a great explosion involves all the characters in de - struction .

		Much would depend upon the acting of the actual presentation as to whether or not the play would descend into melodrama or be sublimated into something approaching true tragedy .

		THE MOST FAMOUS SERIAL ever published , as the always instructive and entertaining `` Tit-Bits '' points out , was that which , run - ning for forty-three numbers , though first planned to end in twelve , in `` The National Era , '' of
Washington	LOCATION	, sixty -
five years ago	DATE	, has since been translated into twenty-two languages , and in book form has had the .

		largest circulation of any book in the world except the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		So says our English author - ity , and we have no facts or figures with which to refute the assertion .

		The story , of course , was `` Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' written as it ran , and bringing to its author three hun - dred dollars in its serial form a princely remuneration as Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	was inclined to view it at that time .

		But when the book , timidly rejected by a prominent publisher with fears of alienating Southern patronage , and finally accepted by an obscure but more venturesome firm , made its appearance , it needed only six months to bring to its writer the sum of twenty thousand dollars on a ten per-cent royalty .

		It is curious to recall that at about the same time another woman writer achieved an astonishing success with a serial story that started as modestly and unexpect - edly as did Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's immortal creation .

		`` Jessica 's First Prayer , '' by a contributor signing herself ``
Hesba Stretton	PERSON	, '' was ac - cepted by the editor of ``
Sunday	DATE	at Home '' and won immediate success .

		In book form this simple tale has run into the millions and been read with delight in nearly all the tongues of the civilized world .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 89 THE AUTHOR OF '' HOME , SWEET HOME '' was in many ways an extraordinary man ; but though
John Howard Payne	PERSON	wrote many poems and several plays , he is only remem - bered by this ballad .

		He was an actor and playright of some ability , and a great habitue of literary circles in the
London	LOCATION	of his day .

		The following anecdote , related in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Mirror '' of
August 8 , 1835	DATE	, is illus - trative of his versatility and good memory .


William Elliston	PERSON	, theater manager in Man - chester and
Birmingham	LOCATION	, had gone up to
London	LOCATION	in search of `` talent , '' and while there was introduced to
Payne	PERSON	, who at the time was doing editorial work .

		Becoming friendly , he invited him to visit him at
Manchester	LOCATION	to see the way they treated Shakespeare in that city .

		Unfortunately , the night they arrived the actor who was to play
Richard III	PERSON	.

		failed to appear .

		What was to be done ?

		Had
Payne	PERSON	played the part ?

		Yes , but long ago ; he had forgotten it entirely .

		Elliston requested him to repeat what he remembered .

		Payne com - plied with some hesitation , and the manager was so enthused and relieved that he asked him to take the part that evening .

		The aston - ished
Payne	PERSON	refused .

		Then he was asked if he would only finish what he had just begun .

		When
Payne	PERSON	finished , he looked around .

		The manager had disappeared .

		In a few minutes , however , he returned .

		Again he asserted that he could not possibly undertake a role whose business he had utterly forgotten .

		Elliston insisted ; in fact , told him that at that very instant his name was on every billboard in the city .

		The quick-witted manager had seized his opportunity while
Richard	PERSON	was evolving from the unconscious actor 's brain , and had taken the bull by the horns .


Richard III	PERSON	.

		was never acted better in
Manchester	LOCATION	than on that occasion ; although afterwards the leading man professed that he had only spouted something like the original .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		SLIPS OF THE TONGUE IN SHAKESPEAEE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his truly epoch-making book , `` The Psychopathology of Every-Day Life , '' Professor
Freud	PERSON	, the greatest reader of the human soul since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, maintains and proves that `` slips of the tongue '' are not the meaningless manifestations of inattention that they are generally considered to be , but the unintentional expression of the speaker 's real thoughts .

		A person makes a slip of the tongue when he speaks of one thing while thinking of another , perhaps without even being conscious of the intruding thought .

		This accounts for a large class of neologisms and other apparent absurdities in speech , for example , saying `` brav - ageous '' when one is choosing between the words `` brave '' and `` courageous . ''

		This also accounts , in part , for the very common peculiarity of persons saying the opposite of what they intend .

		The intruding thought always stands in some sort of relationship to the subject the speaker is discussing , and is a manifestation of a repressed train of thought .

		Another kind of slip of the tongue occurs when a speaker is about to say something that is in conflict with his wishes .

		Thus an embarrassed and dissatisfied presiding officer at a convention declared the meeting `` adjourned '' when he should have said `` open . ''

		A third class of slips of the tongue occurs when a person utters another word or name than the one intended .

		This happens only if some disagreeable experience or emotion is associated in the speaker 's mind with the intended word or name .

		Thus some time ago a psychoanalyst spoke of the joint authorship of Bleuler and
Freud	PERSON	when he meant to say
Breuer	PERSON	and
Freud	ORGANIZATION	.

		The explanation for the slip lay , among other things , in the speaker 's dislike for
Breuer	PERSON	because he was not as favorably disposed to the new psychology as Bleuler is and because he regretted
Breuer	PERSON	's association with
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's early work .

		More personal causes were also involved .

		The resemblance between the two names had little to do with it , as is easily enough demonstrable .

		A fourth kind of slip of the tongue occurs when a speaker involuntarily divulges something he is thinking of but which he wants to conceal .

		The error is due to insufficient attention .

		Shakespeare , like many others , poets and novel - ists , with the intuition characteristic of genius , understood the psychology of slips of the tongue , and now and then introduced one into his plays very effectively .

		In `` As You Like It '' -LRB- IV , 3 , 132 -RRB- ,
Oliver	PERSON	, describing to the disguised
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Celia	PERSON	, how
Orlando	LOCATION	, single-handed , gave battle to | a hungry lioness that he might save from death j his wicked and unnatural brother , betrays his | identity by a slip of the tongue .

		Carried away ' by his own emotion in the narration of the stir - j ring encounter , in which he always speaks of him - j self in the third person , he exclaims : `` in which hurtling -LSB- = din of conflict -RSB- from miserable slumber 7 awak 'd . ''

		This facilitates the forward movement of the play , and does away with the necessity of a formal introduction .

		-LRB- In one of the tales of
Margaret of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	there is a similar betrayal of identity by a slip of the tongue . -RRB-

		A little later in the same scene .

		-LRB- IV , 3 , 159 -RRB- ,
Rosalind	PERSON	,
Celia	PERSON	's supposed brother -LRB- IV , 3 , 88 -RRB- , swoons at the sight of the napkin dyed in her lover 's blood ; thereupon
Celia	PERSON	, greatly alarmed , and forgetting the role
Rosalind	PERSON	is playing , exclaims : `` Cousin ! ''

		but sud - denly realizing her mistake she seeks to correct it by exclaiming , `` Ganymede ! ''

		Some editors , for - getting that
Rosalind	PERSON	is posing as
Celia	PERSON	's brother , say there is no slip of the tongue here and that `` cousin '' is `` used loosely '' as often by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in the sense of `` niece , nephew , uncle , brother-in - law , and grandchild . ''

		They indicate this in their text by reading `` Cousin Ganymede ! ''

		instead of , as
Johnson	PERSON	suggested , `` Cousin Ganymede ! ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15 Othello	DATE	, consumed with jealousy , seeks to control his passion and show a calm exterior while read - ing the letter from the Venetian senate ordering his recall ; but so overwhelmed is he with anger on hearing
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	speak of her `` love for Cassio '' that he can not contain himself and bursts out -LRB- IV , 1 , 229 -RRB- with the words , `` Fire and brimstone ! ''

		before he is aware of it , and thus betrays to us the volcanic passion that is raging within him .

		This is , of course , also true of his exclamation -LRB- IV , 1 , 222 -RRB- , `` Are you sure of that ? ''

		when Ms unsuspecting wife says to her kinsman that he `` shall make all well '' between her husband and
Cassio	PERSON	.

		These slips of his prepare us for the utter loss of self-control that manifests itself when he strikes her a few minutes later .

		His pent-up passion must find a vent or precipitate him into another epileptic spell which would be inartis - tic , would enlist our sympathies in his behalf -LRB- instead of
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , would puzzle the senate , and would confuse the issues .

		An admirable instance of a slip of the tongue occurs in `` Twelfth Night '' -LRB- II , 5 , 62 -RRB- .

		Malvolio , the priggish and conceited Steward , sitting in the orchard , is indulging in a typical day-dream of future greatness .

		In his mind 's eye he sees him - self married to the
Lady Olivia	LOCATION	and revels in the fantasy of lording it over those who have incurred his displeasure .

		He orders Sir
Toby	PERSON	, his pet aversion , to be brought before him .

		`` Seven of my people , '' says he , `` with an obedient start make out for him ; I frown the while , and perchance wind up my watch , or play with my some rich jewel . ''

		The dash after `` my '' does not occur in the Folio , and some modern editors omit it , inter - preting `` my some rich jewel '' to mean `` some rich jewel of mine . ''


Daniel	PERSON	suggested changing the words `` my some '' to `` my handsome , '' and Dyce proposed omitting the word `` my '' as an accidental repetition resulting from the preceding `` my watch . ''

		Collier introduced the dash , and explained the passage thus : `` Malvolio , after mentioning his watch , wants to mention some other jewelled ornament , but is unable to think of one at the moment and therefore merely says `` some rich jewel . ''


Nicholson	PERSON	, retaining
Collier	PERSON	's dash , explains the passage in a manner which `` carries instant and complete conviction '' -LRB-
Furness	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He says : `` There is here a true touch of nature and a most humorous one .

		While Sir
Toby	PERSON	is being fetched to the presence , the
Lord Malvolio	ORGANIZATION	would f rowningly wind up his watch or play with and here from force of habit he fingers -LSB- the chain about his neck , his badge of office -RSB- , and is about to add ` play with my chain , ' but suddenly remem - bering that he would be no longer a steward , or other gold-chained attendant , he stops short , and then confusedly -LSB- covers up his slip of the tongue and -RSB- alters his phrase to ` some rich jewel . ' ''

		The watch may , by association , have suggested the chain .

		A striking and significant slip of the tongue , which has not escaped the critics , occurs in `` Macbeth '' -LRB- I. 5 , 34 ed .

		Furness -RRB- .

		Lady Macbeth , her mind occupied with murderous thoughts awakened by her husband 's letter , is impatiently and tigress-like pacing her room when one of her servants enters and announces the coming of the
King	LOCATION	.

		In her then state of mind it would have been madness for the
King	ORGANIZATION	knowingly to put himself in her power .

		The shock of surprise momentarily robs her of her self-control and she bursts out : `` Thou ` rt mad to say it . ''

		Then , fearing that she has betrayed what is beating in her brain , she adds : `` Is not thy master with him ?

		who , wer ' t so , would have inform 'd for preparation . ''

		In `` The Tempest '' -LRB- III .

		1 , 36-37 -RRB- the charming , innocent , love-infected Miranda in an unguarded moment betrays her name which she was for - bidden to reveal to her equally infected lover by as pretty a lapsus linguce as may be found any - where in literature .

		Early in
1910	DATE	, Dr.
Otto Rank	PERSON	announced that he had discovered in one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB- III .

		2 , 3-18 -RRB- , an instance of a lapsus linguae determined by `` the disturbing influence of a suppressed thought , '' namely , in
Portia	LOCATION	's speech to
Bassanio	LOCATION	just before he chooses the casket that is to determine their fate .

		She , perfectly happy in her love , is content to have him `` peize the time , eke it out and draw it out in length , to stay him from election '' ; but he , impatient and impetuous adventurer and needy , too is bent on getting through with the business .

		To her the result means either eternal misery or eternal happiness ; to him the gain or loss of a fortune and a wife .

		Under these cir - cumstances she addresses him as follows : `` Forbear a while !

		There 's something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you ; and you know yourself , Hate counsels not in such a quality .

		But lest you should not understand me well I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me .

		I could teach you How to choose right , but then I am forsworn ; So -LSB- i. e. forsworn -RSB- will I never be ; so may you miss me ; But if you do , you 'll make me wish a sin , That I had been forsworn .

		Beshrew your eyes , They have o'erlook 'd -LSB- = bewitched -RSB- me , and divided me ; One half of me is yours , th ' other half yours , Mine own , I would -LSB- = : should -RSB- say ; but if mine , then yours , And so all yours . ''

		Commenting on the above passage Dr.
Rank	PERSON	says : '' -LSB-
Portia	PERSON	-RSB- would like to tell -LSB-
Bassanio	PERSON	-RSB- that even in the event of failure , he should be assured of her love ; but is prevented from doing so by her solemn promise to her father . ''

		In this mental discord she addresses her suitor with the words quoted and makes the slip of the tongue indicated in italics .

		According to Rank ,
Portia	PERSON	meant to say : `` One - half of me is yours , the other half mine , '' but her tongue slipped into saying `` the other half yours . ''

		He continues : `` What she intended only to hint at remotely , because she ought really not to have said anything about it , namely , that she loves him and is wholly his even before he chooses , the poet with admirable psychologic insight allows to leak out in a slip of the tongue and by this device manages to allay the unbearable uncertainty of the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 lover -LSB- ! -RSB-

		and the distressing tension of the audi - ence as to the outcome of the selection . ''

		Dr.
Rank	PERSON	's rendering of
Portia	LOCATION	's meaning and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's motive does not satisfy me .

		I can find no slip of the tongue , accidental or intentional , in
Portia	LOCATION	's disclosure of the conflict between her love and her determination to continue loyal to her father 's behest .

		It is impossible to read her words and not find in them a frank admission of her love .

		She makes no attempt to conceal the true state of her emotions .

		This love of hers is too serious a matter for trifling ; with her earnestness and sincerity , she raises the choice of the caskets to the dignity of a solemn religious ceremony , and thus justifies her father 's strange injunction .

		It is true she says , `` it is not love ; but who that has a heart does not feel that the words , spoken with arch playfulness , mean the direct opposite of what they purport ?

		Then , as if fearing that
Bassanio	PERSON	's masculine stupidity in such matters might not interpret her aright -LRB- `` lest you should not understand me well '' -RRB- , and as if reproaching herself for not having told the truth , and perhaps for having caused him a moment 's pain , she assures him that `` hate counsels not in such a quality . ''

		Any actress who has a feeling of her business , and every reader that has but half a heart and a little imagination , would read the line in question : '' One-half of me is yours , th ' other half .

		.

		yours / '
Portia	LOCATION	, having just confessed that her lovers eyes had bewitched and divided her , speaks as if she meant to say that she retained one-half of herself for herself , but with a sudden ebullition of her love and with a complete self - surrender she frankly admits that she is wholly his ; one-half of me is yours , the other half is also yours .

		In this way we rise to a climax from her preliminary `` it is not love '' to her culminating `` all yours . ''

		Dr.
Rank	PERSON	was probably misled in his interpretation by taking the word `` I would say '' to mean `` I intended to say '' instead of `` I should -LSB- or ought to -RSB- say '' a meaning that the word `` would '' often had in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		Incidentally it may be remarked that the tension of the audience -LRB- or reader -RRB- is in no danger of breaking .

		Those who have read this play carefully and are acquainted with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's method know that
Portia	LOCATION	's approval of
Nerissa	ORGANIZATION	's praises of
Bassanio	LOCATION	, and a few other touches in the first two acts , sufficiently apprise the audience of the fact that
Bassanio	PERSON	is destined to choose the right casket .

		That is perhaps one reason why the great necromancer does not treat us to even a single love-scene between
Portia	LOCATION	and
Bassanio	PERSON	.

		POETEY AND OTHEB THINGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the New Republic of
March 11	DATE	,
Edward Storer	PERSON	assures us that free verse is no longer an experiment but has `` become a recognized medium of literary expression . ''

		Almost every modern poet uses it exclusively or in addition to his regular verse .

		He is not , however , entirely satisfied with the result : `` We use it because we must , because it is more real than the conventional meters and possesses a living rhythm as opposed to their dil - letante rhythm , and also because it is directed by an intenser rhythmical ardor than prose . ''

		Struc - turally then it stands half way between the older poetry and prose .

		The poet who would give expression to modern realities , he says , must either use it or prose .

		The only reason why he should not resort to the latter , so far as appears , is that there would be a loss of rhythmical ardor .

		The material would be just the same .

		What then is rhythmical ardor ?

		What is a living rhythm ?

		The latter , I suppose , is a natural as opposed to a studied or artificial rhythm .

		`` All writing , '' he tells us , meaning all spoken language , `` we must suppose , has a rhythmical beat of some kind , and language as it tends toward a greater symbolical intensity of feeling tends also toward a more pronounced and formal rhythm . ''

		This I take to mean that there is a sort of rhythm in the most prosaic prose , and as the feeling which strives to clothe itself in language becomes intense , the language will become more rhythmic ; that is , it will more and more take on the form of the tra - ditional meters .

		In other words , prose informed by emotion , will pass into free verse on its way to formal or regular verse which it will not quite reach .

		But this in no way explains the reason for dividing it into bines .

		This he proceeds to make clear to himself .

		.

		The interior rhythm whatever that may be existing in prose , asserts itself in much greater degree in free verse , `` Gathering intensity and form as it develops from the lax and wayward rhythm of prose , it tends to impose itself on the eye as well as upon the interior hear - ing and to demand the line length . ''

		It is not all in the eye however .

		`` The verse may be said rather to divide itself into lengths according to some almost unconscious combined action of ear and eye pressed into the service of the verse by the dominating impulse of the poet . ''

		It is not a `` cutting up prose into lines . ''

		It is an `` instinctive impulse of the verse itself whose interior vigor craves such an arrangement . ''

		It may be doubted whether verse , apart from the mind of the poet , has an impulse or interior vigor that craves anything at all .

		So far as form is concerned the process is just as artificial as an arrangement in measured lines .

		It is a matter of carving , rather ; it requires the combined action of eye and hand .

		The poet does not want his verse to look like prose , hence the division into variform lines and assorted meters .

		What the impulse or interior vigor has tried to do he tells us is `` to secure a regular rhythmic content for its expres - sion .

		Free verse is verse true in material and inspiration which has not succeeded in obtaining for itself a definite form . ''

		This means that free verse would , if it could , express itself in the dille - tante rhythm and ordered meters of regular verse .

		It fails because its material can not be forced into the traditional moulds .

		Here again we might sup - pose that the material and inspiration of free verse would depend largely on the poet , and indeed , Mr. storer recognizes the fact .

		The poet fails , he tells us , because he is still under the `` debilitating influ - ences of a dilletante sense of poetry , which should 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	really be content with the old conventional verse forms . ''

		`` The great majority of rhymsters and verse makers '' should in fact use nothing but the old forms .

		They will produce drawing-room poetry which will please themselves and their friends .

		It will have no relation with modern life .

		`` They will pour these perfumed ecstacies into the delicious old vessels , where all their life and char - acter will be lost . ''

		All these dissenters from the orthodox fold have a great deal to say about the realities of modern life .


Amy Lowell	PERSON	labels
Milton	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	back numbers , because they are completely out of focus with the realities of modern life .

		What are these realities and how do they differ from the realities of ancient or medieval life ?

		All life is made up of psychological factors which react against the material world .

		The old poetry dealt with the hopes and fears , desires , aspirations , passions , love and hate of men and women and the actions resulting therefrom .

		Modern poetry will perhaps try to see how the change of view in philosophy and religion , and the advance of science and indus - trial development affects these primary and perma - nent motives .

		This field is , however , pretty fully occupied by the novelist and story writer , who have an immense advantage over the free versifier , ham - pered as he is by the harrowing doubt as to the proper division of his lines and the debilitating influence of the old poetry which will not allow him to divide into paragraphs or periods as in other forms of prose .

		Prose it is , generally speaking , spite of protest .

		Poetic material it may sometimes have which deserves a better setting .

		A few examples will make this clear .

		In the
April	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' Professor
Lewis Worthington Smith	PERSON	pays his disrespects to some verses printed in a daily paper which had received the editorial endorsement that they were `` worthy of place in any anthology of English lit - erature . ''

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	criticises them as com - monplace and not poetry at all .

		With the subject matter I have no present concern .

		What I wish to emphasize is that apart from an arbitrary divi - sion into lines it is , in structure , just prose .

		Here it is before the eye got in its work .

		`` I will arise : I will go up into the lofty places apart from all man 's work , and there commune with God and mine own soul .

		I will search out by lonely thought some meaning or accord or radiant sanction that may justify the ways of life .

		The void and troubled world will I renounce , to gain in solitude what the world gave not sense of life 's design . ''

		Let it be noted here that this is far more met - rical than most free verse , and the division of lines as will be seen later , is not very remote from ordinary blank verse .

		Now suppose that you , never having seen the poem , should hear it read , could you form any idea at all as to how the author had divided his lines ?

		Under the licence of free verse there are a half a dozen ways at least , all equally good and none of them changing the value in the least .

		What the author did do is this : I will arise ; I will go up into the lofty places Apart from all man 's work , and there commune With God and mine own soul .

		I will search out By lonely thought some meaning or accord Or radiant sanction that may justify The ways of life .

		The void and troubled world Will I renounce , to gain in solitude What the world gave not sense of life 's design .

		In passing I may note the fact that the writer has not wholly freed himself from poetic diction and those inversions which
Amy Lowell	PERSON	considers the bane of the old poetry .

		Other arrangement of lines I leave to the ingenuity of the reader .

		Any one who has read
Dickens	PERSON	will recall page after page more regular in meter than the above , which could be easily divided into lines of nearly uniform length .

		It was not at all intended to be poetry .

		The rhythm is simply that in which the thought of the writer , driven by a deep emotion , took form .

		Lincoln 's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	speech has been put into the form of free verse , without changing it to the ear in the least .

		It remains just what is was , a noble bit of prose .

		For further illustration I take an extract from an account of the recent flood in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		It is just a specimen of the ordinary reporter 's English , the writer having not the most remote suspicion that he was writing poetry .

		I shall take the liberty to set him in his proper place among the writers of free verse : When the terrific gale That had been raging many days Came to a climax of fury ; First the moaning , blood-curdling Song of the waves , The rumble and crash of thunder , And the roar of the onslaught on the dykes ; Then the snapping and tearing As the sea wall gave way And the shrieking of the storm gods As the ocean poured over the stricken land .

		Notice the nearly regular meter of some of the lines .

		Here too the lines might be variously divided .

		It is not necessary to multiply examples .

		To those who disagree with me they would prove noth - ing .

		To my mind they show clearly that the difference between impassioned prose and free verse is merely the division into lines it is poetry to the eye only .

		What then has the eye to do with poetry ?

		Without being too minute we may say the eye perceives nothing but form and color or gradations of light .

		Structurally , poetry is altogether a mat - ter of sound with which the eye has nothing to do ; and this is of course equally true of prose .

		What it is to the mind we need not concern our - selves here , for we are only discussing the mechanics of verse .

		Spoken language long pre - ceded the written .

		It is made up of sounds which at some time resolved themselves into long and short or accented and unaccented syllables on which rhythm depends .

		These are perceived by the ear only which conveys their meaning to the mind .

		Writing is a sort of mechanical memory .

		The eye reports to the mind certain symbols which represent sounds to which meanings have been attached .

		In reading we mentally reproduce these sounds , or if not fully , their rhythm .

		In speaking
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 93 or reading aloud we actually reproduce them .

		Poetry therefore , aside from its intellectual con - .

		tent is a matter of sound not of sight .

		Nor must we forget the relation of poetry to music and painting .

		Music is the language of emo - ' .

		tion , pure and simple .

		Poetry shares its rhythm ; and part of its emotion which it strives to embody j in language .

		The minstrel sang his verses , as some j modern poets do , somewhat as the priest intones | the litany .

		Music conveys no specific information : but does communicate its emotion .

		Poetry loses < a part of the simple emotion but adds a certain , ; intellectual content .

		In prose at its lowest terms j there is no emotion , but definite information for i the intellect only .

		In both primarily , the ear , not !

		the eye , is addressed .

		Painting and the other arts j reveal their meaning , part emotion and part know - ledge , to the eye .

		Of all the arts poetry and music are nearest akin .

		Hand in hand they have come j down through the ages .

		There is , to be sure , a new , music which seeks to free itself from the old forms but its capricious and vagrant rhythm does not j bring it into nearer accord with free verse .

		But once more , why may not the realities of | modern life be put in regular verse ?

		Is it more difficult than to put the realities of any age into regular verse ?

		Modern life is immensely com - plex in its activities but the fundamental facts j and motives are just the same as '' when brains full-blooded ticked two centuries since . ''

		`` The I Ring and the Book '' deals with the same problems we have to-day and many of us think that , despite i much which may be criticised ,
Browning	PERSON	has , handled them pretty well .

		There has been great i advance in science , great changes in philosophy j and religious views and
Milton	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	are out of focus with this development but not with that of their own age .

		The latter is , indeed , in touch with the deep realities of all life .

		Which of our moderns has told so moving a story as that of Francesca da
Rimini	LOCATION	and her lover ?

		That which greatly separates us from the past is our enormous industrial development .

		Ours is the age of great factories , rolling mills , railroads , telegraphs , telephones , automobiles ,
Panama Canals	LOCATION	, great engineering projects , the `` movies , '' and machine music .

		The poetic material in all this is not large and what there is can be put into the old poetic forms if one is willing to spend the necessary time and labor .

		Whether this is worth while is another question .

		The writer of free verse thinks , correctly no doubt , that with less labor he can use a great deal more of the raw j material .

		It does not occur to him that in elimi - nating the old forms he has destroyed the charac - teristic feature of poetry , nor that he could use much more of this material and to greater satisfac - j tion in prose .

		He quite ignores the fact that prose !

		at its best is a very fine art indeed , little inferior to real poetry .

		Speaking still of form not substance there is no doubt at all that real poets have plenty of trouble in putting their thought and feeling into regular verse .

		The difficulty is extreme and increases with the artificiality of the form .

		It does limit the thought .

		The sonnet , perfect in its music , i without redundance or padding or commonplace , is almost non-existent .

		What then ?

		These forms were chosen for their intrinsic beauty not because they were useful .

		The sonnet is a gem , not a prize squash .

		Go back as far as we please we shall find the same limitations , differing perhaps in degree .

		I do not believe that Homer , in a state of mental exaltation , improvised his hexameters , to the accompaniment of his harp but that he spent laborious days , with many experiments , in prepar - ing that which he would recite at a sitting .

		I do not believe that
Milton	PERSON	`` lisped in numbers '' except as most children make rhymes , or that the `` num - bers came '' unsought .

		Blank verse is the easiest of all and , except in a very few hands , the least satisfactory .

		Rhyme , nothing in itself , adds won - derfully to the effect and also to the difficulty .

		The arrangement of the lines in the stanza is a further complication .

		It is a dull ear nevertheless that does not find an increase of beauty in this complexity , as a matter of sound or music .

		All this of course does not make poetry but it is , I think , an integral part of it .

		There must be the elevated thought and vibrant emotion , which again by itself does not make poetry .

		We find this in kind if not quite in degree , in prose and perhaps in free verse .

		What I have seen in free verse , of which I have read very little , is a certain extravagance in phrase to make up for rather indifferent matter .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	sending `` his barbaric yawp over the house tops '' set the fashion .

		What , in the extract first quoted , is a `` radiant sanction '' ?

		And does light ooze `` out of the tree tops into the white gaps of the sky '' ' ?

		And does one , after a bath , `` smell the stars '' ?

		Mrs.
Comer	PERSON	in her `` Poetry of To-day , '' in the
April	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' quotes a little poem of which she says , `` It would be hard to recall more vividly an
August	DATE	after - noon '' : O wind rend open the heat , cut apart the heat , rend it sideways .

		Fruit can not drop through this thick air ; that presses up and blunts the points of pears and rounds the grapes .

		Cut the heat plough through it turning it on either side of your path .

		Now to start with , the writer 's specifications have no place `` in realities of modern life '' or any other .

		The air of an
August	DATE	afternoon is not thick but grows thinner in proportion to the increase of heat .

		It does not press up but on all sides of the pear alike .

		That the hot air should blunt the points of pears is one of those extrava - gant conceits , supposed to show originality , which to an alienist would tend to show a disordered mind .

		But now let us see how it looks without a division into lines .

		I have in one place substituted a comma for a semi-colon which clearly does not belong there .

		94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	`` 0 wind rend open the heat , cut apart the heat , rend it sideways .

		Fruit can not drop in this thick air , that presses up and blunts the points of pears and rounds the grapes .

		Cut the heat plough through it turning it on either side of your path . ''

		The punctuation could still be much improved but it would not make poetry of that which is only rather poor prose .

		If there were a literary Pure Food Law the author might be prosecuted for mis - branding .

		To sum up in a word : All spoken language is made up of sounds to which meanings have been attached .

		The sounds are addressed to the ear only ; the meanings , through the ear , to mind and heart .

		The eye has nothing to do with either .

		In written language the eye interprets the sound sym - bols , nothing more .

		Prose in any form is prose , but poetry , good or bad , is poetry by virtue of its form .

		Destroy that and , whatever the content may be , it is no longer poetry .

		I can not believe that free verse is to become a permanent literary form .

		It is in my view a hybrid on whose sterility we may pretty certainly reckon .

		There may be some -LRB- there was till lately at least one -RRB- who knew that remarkable person only through report and the covers or beau - tiful jackets of previous works .

		Those who already know these entertaining books will merely skim over a review to see if the re - viewer agrees with them .

		As to those who do not know although Nars-ed-Din in the old tale said `` There is no use in talking to such stupid people '' yet they may not in this case really be stupid , considering the size and intelligence of our reading public .

		Such people may be told that this book is a very amusing combination of narratism and description : narratism in an exciting and mysterious love story ; description in accounts of all sort of attractive places in
New York	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	.

		As for the story , it is of the sort mentioned by Miss

		on '' ?

		Miss
Moore	PERSON	had previously written something about the `` writings of critics who live by having opinions about other people . ''

		-LRB- This , by the way , is only her imaginative way of putting things ; nobody lives by that means ; even critics live otherwise and only have opinions to ' provide themselves with modest luxuries . -RRB-

		However that be ,
Patricia	PERSON	goes on with the somewhat original view `` I see by them that romance is not truth '' .

		But this is satirical on her part ; she evidently thinks that her romance is truth .

		A part of it obviously is true because it is about actual places :
Long Island	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	and the North Shore ; the
White Mountains	LOCATION	and the rest of the Ideal Tour ;
Patricia	PERSON	herself is an attrac - tive young person and her mastery of the English language is excellently conveyed .

		The daughter of an extravagant American , educated in a French convent and coming to
America	LOCATION	for the first time since childhood , she is peculiarly open to adventure .

		I will not cast doubt on the truth of any of these adventures , though some strain the imagi - nation .

		For one thing , I do not think that three boys -LRB- even just graduated from Har - vard -RRB- would be so devoted to a girl who is touring in a
Grayles Gril	ORGANIZATION	car with the man she was engaged to , as to follow her from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Great Barrington	LOCATION	via
Bretton Woods	ORGANIZATION	in an inferior car called the
Hippo	ORGANIZATION	- potamus .

		There may be some foundation , but on the surface it looks as unlikely as it is that
Jack	PERSON	should have crossed ``
Whittier	LOCATION	's beloved Merrimac '' in going from Swamp - scott to
Marblehead	LOCATION	.

		Still it would be pe - dantic to try to tie the authors of this enter - taining book down to absolute and bare facts .

		Imagination , romance , and tradition is what they like , and if they can find it in conscien - tious old
New England	LOCATION	, one should surely not do anything to discourage .


Jack Winston	PERSON	has a fine romantic spirit : he is full of all the romantic associations of the places through which these confirmed motorists make their way .

		I do not know which of these able writers supplies the local color and which supplies the story , nor indeed is it obvious that the book is written in just that way .

		If it is , however , each has fairly surpassed the other .

		Not only do we have attractive and amusing accounts of
summer	DATE	in
New Eng	LOCATION	- land , as seen from the road , but we also have an amusing and interesting love story devel - oped by means of the motor car tours .

		Neither of these things are impossibilities , but prob - ably neither have been done much better than in the present book .

		If the novel reader cares to go on with `` Seeing America '' this
summer	DATE	he will nat -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 95 urally run across `` Father
Bernard	PERSON	's Parish . ''

		Anyone who has been reading about
New England	LOCATION	and its past and present will feel that he is getting into a totally different country in turning to this story of Irish and German .

		Italian and
Pole	LOCATION	in upper
New York	LOCATION	.

		Father
Bernard	PERSON	's Parish includes Co - lumbus Avenue about One Hundredth Street and the adjacent territory .

		Among his parish - ioners are Mrs.
Halligan	PERSON	, who goes out to I cook , her daughter
Annie	PERSON	, designated for the convent , and her son
Tom	PERSON	, expressman : Mrs.
Zuckerman	PERSON	.

		in whose bakery and lunch room works
Lena Schramin	PERSON	, a Polish girl ,
Oscar Hauser	PERSON	of the delicatessen store and Fran - cisco Madeo .

		a gang-boss , as well as many others , from other nations still .

		Among these varied people the only person who suggests the
America	LOCATION	which the Lightning Conductor discovered is
George Wagner	PERSON	, the drug-store clerk .

		He came from
Hillsville	LOCATION	, a little old town in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, `` as quiet as a wheat field . ''

		There is all the difference in the world between these books .

		The difference between the noisy city and the charming open coun - tryside , between the rich , or at least those who seem to have little occupation except that of amusing themselves , and the plain common every day people who do the work that makes the world go ` round .

		But there is no more striking difference than that be - tween the
America	LOCATION	which they present and the
America	LOCATION	of the Hudson and the
White Mountains	LOCATION	, of Irving and
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		and the American of the present era of the `` Melting Pot . ''

		But it is not at all the thing to treat Miss :
Olmstead	PERSON	's book merely as a sociological doc - ument .

		It is an excellent story both in its j study and in its working out .

		It is a sign of j reality in a book when the writer can accom - plish his purpose by acts and incidents which though unexpected are pretty clearly the nat - ural expression of the different people con - cerned .

		I must confess that I do not know just how an Italian gang-boss and a Polish waitress would act under given conditions and perhaps I know no more about an American drug-store clerk or an Irish expressman .

		But Miss
Olmstead	PERSON	seems all right to me .

		Her characters and .

		of course , they are the chief element of the story , are drawn in a most lively and definite way , and though they do not always do just as one would expect , they do at least what seems natural .

		Father Ber - nard alone seems rather a romantic figure , but he is certainly all that such a father ought to be .

		and it is greatly to be hoped that he is j a fine type of a great number .

		People are very different about such books and about such phases of life .

		Some will merely feel repelled by such an uptown street in
summer	DATE	with its stream of delivery wagons , push-carts , trucks , automobiles , trolleys , ele - vated cars running forever between its bound - aries of poor stores and little restaurants with their rows of flats above , and on every hand a heterogeneous and discordant nation - ality .

		They find much more charming the lovely old time villages and the beautiful mountain-side and sea-shore which the Light - ning Conductor discovered and which he saw with a charm heightened by the associations of literature and history .

		Other people feel quite differently .

		It does not matter much how people feel : each book presents an Amer - ica that exists , an
America	LOCATION	that we must take account of , an
America	LOCATION	that an American had better know .

		One might query a little as to whether the same thing could be said of Miss
Florence Irwin	PERSON	's `` The Road to Mecca . ''

		Does that represent a real
America	LOCATION	?

		The book is one of not a few that have appeared in the last few years , which present the determined effort of an attractive woman to gain a place in the highest society .


Ellie Brewster	PERSON	begins as an ordinary young woman in
Allenbury	LOCATION	, which might be almost any small town not very far from
New York	LOCATION	.

		She has ideas of rising in the world ; the story tells how she succeeds .

		One will think of several books of late which have told much the same story , but the career of
Ellie Brewster	PERSON	differs from that of the others in that they usually get on by their beauty , whereas she .

		though she has a pretty face , really gets on because she has a good head behind it .

		Theoretically such a subject is even more American than the others of which we have been speaking .

		Quite as instructive at least as scenery and tradition on the one hand , or the different elements of the meling pot on the other , is the general possibility in Amer - ica of passing from the plainest and simplest phases of life to the finest and highest .

		In Miss
Irwin	PERSON	's book , however , we do not have exactly that change , we have instead some - thing which has probably become more and more a popular ideal of late , namely a `` social '' rise .

		Miss
Irwin	PERSON	does not affect to believe that such a change in social position is worth while ; indeed it is very clear that she is cer - tain that it is not .

		The book is called `` The Road to Mecca '' as though it looked to a holy and sacred end , but the prelude and after - piece show that such is not the aim and object of
Ellie Brewster	PERSON	.

		96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	It may be that the social climber is an exceptionally American figure .

		It is certainty one which has literary possibilities and in the present enormous popularization of interest and acquaintance with the doings of `` wealth and fashion , '' it may very well be that there are not a few girls nowadays who resolve to rise from being social nobodies to being at the top of the social ladder , just as in our youth we used to hear of the poor boy who was bound to be President .

		I rather doubt though if there are many striking cases .

		It seems to one rather more of a literary conventionality than an actual fact .

		As such , however , of course
Miss Irwin	PERSON	has a right to it and does well with it .

		I fancy there are quite as many young girls from Allenbury who become lead - ers of wealth and fashion , as there are English tourists in
America	LOCATION	who know as much as
Jac Winstrom	PERSON	did , or parish priests of such certain intuition and delicate tact as Father
Bernard	PERSON	.

		It is quite a change from these American books to
Marmaduke Pickthall	PERSON	's `` The House of War . ''

		Whoever read Mr.
Pickthall	PERSON	's ear - lier book , `` Veiled Women , '' will be sure to remember how rich it was in local color , in its knowledge of life in the
East	LOCATION	and its feel - ing for it .

		This as I recall it was the striking thing about the story of an Englishwoman who shocked all the traditions of her race by marrying the son of an Egyptian Pasha .

		This story is about another Englishwoman in the East who did something that is probably more extraordinary .

		Miss
Elsie Wilding	PERSON	, a young Englishwoman , independent and of consid - erable fortune , has come to some
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	city , in Palestine presumably , to visit two aunts who have for many years maintained a quasi - missionary school in memory of a sister .

		She is herself full of missionary zeal and after a short time at the aunts , she desires to go and settle in a native village that she may carry on some work , such as she had imag - ined .

		She does take a house in a native vil - Ige and attempts work among the Muslim .

		The story is an account of her experience .

		Mr.
Pickthall	PERSON	's sympathies are very clear : Miss Wilding he calls a `` poor demented girl '' and her missionary zeal is `` childlike ardor in a foolish faith . ''

		His presentation bears out his language : a young woman must be de - mented who thought that Muslim villagers would be much influenced by preaching like the following : `` Mahomet is not good ,
Ma	LOCATION	- homet can not save you ,
Mahomet	PERSON	is a liar , he will do you harm , Mahomet is very bad .

		Isa is good , Isa loves you ; Isa died for you .

		Come to
Isa	LOCATION	.

		Leave Mahomet , '' and so on intermi - nately .

		I do not know whether she is more demented than the friends who allowed a young woman with plenty of money to go and settle all by herself in a native village with no companion except a native girl .

		After it was all over the Consul said , `` No child should ever be allowed to play near gunpow - der .

		She must go back to
England	LOCATION	. ''

		But at the beginning no one made real objections , which certainly seems almost impossible .

		I confess that gives rather a jar to my feel - ing for Mr.
Pickthall	PERSON	's general reliability , but certainly there is much in his book that is interesting .

		The whole local situation , native Christians , native Muslim , governing Turk , is something worth knowing about , and his typical figures ,
Hasan Pasha	PERSON	,
Sheykh Bakir	PERSON	, and Amin the murderer , all seem excel - lent .

		Of course , influence of
America	LOCATION	is pre - sented as being most unpleasing :
Percy	PERSON	, the son of the miserable old bible-reader , has lived in
America	LOCATION	where he has made money .

		He has also learned to speak a quaint dialect of the English .

		language including such extremes as `` The poison of that proud disdainful girl is in my veins '' and `` Sakes !

		... It 's you that 's the girl for me and not that yaller haired refrigerator ... If ever I get quit of this here fix , I 'll take you and ask you to be Mrs.
Salaman Dixby	PERSON	. ''

		But with all the disagreeable things that one thinks of -LRB- and there are not a few of them -RRB- .

		Mr.
Pickthall	PERSON	writes an interesting story of the
East	LOCATION	.

		When it is obviously in his mind to press a point he is -LRB- like anyone else -RRB- less interesting than when he simply exerts his considerable feeling for character and for humor and his real sentiment for local color .

		But if one will waive that there is a good deal else that one will certainly read with pleasure .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 97 THE SPIRIT OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	. '

		Professor
Franeke	PERSON	's small volume on `` The German Spirit '' should be read by every American who is willing to free himself of prejudice with regard to the spirit of Ger - many in the present war .

		Of the many authors presenting the side of
Germany	LOCATION	, Professor
Francke	PERSON	alone has understood how to address the people of this country .

		When he analyses the German temperament in con - trast with the American , he is at once author - itative and impartial a German would be more likely to resent the comparison than would a citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But in applying the results of his investigation to the present war , Professor
Francke	PERSON	requires some supplementing .

		The book , though it consists of three sepa - rate articles , is a fairly consistent whole .

		The first two parts , `` German Literature '' and `` The True
Germany	LOCATION	, '' appeared in `` The Atlantic Monthly '' ; the third section , hitherto unpublished , is in reality latent in the other two .

		The presentation is remarkably clear , and the author 's native enthusiasm is tem - pered by a fine spirit of cosmopolitanism , in particular by an appreciation of such virtues as are especially American .

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	knows not only of whom he speaks but to whom he speaks .

		The most valuable part of the volume is the first article , which was written before the war began .

		In this essay the author expounds , often with winning humor , the qualities of German character which tend to make German literature unattractive to Americans .

		The revelations are here of the greatest value because they were made with no knowledge of the purpose for which they would ultimately be used .

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	had not imagined that by the time the article was printed
Germany	LOCATION	would have put herself radically in the wrong in the minds of nearly all Americans , even many of those who had known and loved
Germany	LOCATION	in the past .

		This brings us face to face with the great problem .

		Is the
Germany	LOCATION	we have learned to admire and have sought to imitate , the
Germany	LOCATION	of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Kant	PERSON	, and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, is this the country we see and hear of to-day ?

		And if the nation really is the same , how has this violent change of appearance come about ?

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	's book , supplemented by a few observations which it naturally suggests , explains both points .

		* THE GERMAN SPIRIT .


Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Kuno Francke	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: The German , we are told here , is by nature slow , prone to respect authority , distrustful of the vox populi , enamoured of the infinite , and easily inclined to lose himself and his judgment in some great passion .

		These qual - ities are cited to explain the difficulty an average American has in appreciating a liter - ature which is often cumbersome , undemo - cratic , vague , and extravagant .

		To character - ize the faults of German literature in English one needs an equivalent for the word schwdrmerisch , which means at once wild , visionary , and fanatical .

		This explains `` Die Jungfrau von Orleans '' and the second part of `` Faust . ''

		But does it not explain even better the attitude of the German people in the present struggle ?

		Slow to act in a crisis , the common people found themselves at war before they had time to object or even to ask for an explanation .

		Deferential to authority and distrustful of themselves in the mass , they never dreamed of criticizing the way the war was begun or carried on .

		Emotional and idealistic , they proceeded to devote their all to the service of the Fatherland with a hero - ism unexampled in history ; it did not occur to them to ask whether they were really defending the Fatherland by crushing a little country they were pledged to protect or by sinking a great passenger ship without warning .

		Professor '
Francke	PERSON	's second article under - takes to prove that the guiding principles of the older
Germany	LOCATION	are dominant in the
Germany	LOCATION	now at war .

		Kant 's belief that `` man 's dignity and freedom consist in the unconditional surrender to duty '' was applied by Prussian statesmen to the relations of the citizen to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Goethe 's `` struggle toward perfection '' was also given a national significance ; and in the same category ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's ideal of the superman was trans - ferred by
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	and
Bernhardi	PERSON	to the conception of the super-State .


Schiller	PERSON	's faith in the power of art to uplift the soul and reconcile men to the facts of life has resulted in the modern idea of
Kultur	LOCATION	, which has of late been so thoroughly misunderstood .

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	gives as a fine instance of this faith and its vitality the performance of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Iphigenie '' before the German soldiers at
Namiir	ORGANIZATION	.

		The soldier must indeed have felt that he was sent to war by a State `` assiduously cultivating every higher tend - ency , every refining influence . ''

		If these things are so , and the greater a man 's knowledge of
Germany	LOCATION	, the greater will be his conviction that they are so , wherein lies the fallacy of
Germany	LOCATION	's present attitude ?

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	We must here again supplement Professor
Francke	PERSON	, for it is evident that some important change has taken place between the days of
Weimar	LOCATION	and those of
Potsdam	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	himself supplies the key .

		What the older
Germany	LOCATION	lacked , he says , was self - assertion .

		We may now say : What has obscured the fine qualities of the older Ger - many is self-assertion .


Germany	LOCATION	is not satisfied to say that her ideals of duty , of progress , and of culture are good , or even the best ; she insists that they are the only ideals .

		With commendable skill and intelligence , the Germans adopt the work of foreign dramatists or scientists , but never think of crediting the conditions where such geniuses are produced .

		They edit
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and play
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	until they think they own
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		But behind this self-assertion lies a deeper matter , the idolization of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , leading to a narrow and aggressive national - ism , has produced much of the trouble .

		It is both false and dangerous to suppose that the
State	ORGANIZATION	, to quote Professor
Francke	PERSON	, is `` a moral agency superior to society . ''

		On the con - trary , the
State	ORGANIZATION	should subserve the people , and should be at all times responsible to them .

		It is here that
America	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are at opposite extremes , and may learn each from the other , we a higher and more imperative responsibility of the individual to the govern - ment ,
Germany	LOCATION	a higher and more imperative responsibility of the government to the indi - vidual .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's recent article in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' gives the fairest analysis of
Germany	LOCATION	that has yet appeared .

		As he shows ,
Germany	LOCATION	is suffering , not from materialism , but from misdirected idealism .


Germany	LOCATION	's ideal of nationalism is inspiring and enno - bling , but it has at present two fatal defects : it goes too far and it does not go far enough .

		In the first place , it confers power without demanding an equivalent degree of responsi - bility ; in the second place , its application should be enlarged .

		Everything that the German believes of nationalism would be true , if he did but scratch out the word and write instead `` internationalism . ''

		His virtues were fruitful in individualism ; they were still more so , Professor
Francke	PERSON	feels , in national - ism .

		One further stage remains for this great people .

		Their increasing business and com - merce were opening the way for it .

		A fearful setback has come , but those who truly know the German people will yet look with confi - dence beyond this terrible hour to the future of the land which has given the world a Luther , a
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and a
Wagner	PERSON	.

		CHARLES
WHARTON STORK	ORGANIZATION	.

		PROPAGANDA ix THE THEATRE .

		* In that larger consistency which is unafraid of evolution of judgment , it is sometimes nec - essary to rise in opposition to a foundling whose early years of struggle enlisted our earnest support .

		This freer consistency is probably the most exacting of all the masters of criticism , demanding not only an open mind for the apprehension of new and vital movements in literature and art but also a mind deaf to sentiment in order to prevent these new movements from usurping an unwon eminence .

		In its present state of flux , the theatre has imposed an unusually heavy burden upon the critic of its activities .

		Real - ism , naturalism , symbolism , mysticism have proved to be hard tests of catholicity of judg - ment .

		More unruly than any of these , how - ever , has been the problem of propaganda in the theatre .

		When
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, with
Brandes	PERSON	and
Archer	PERSON	as their heralds , blasted a way for propaganda on the modern stage , only a few , beside the sociologists who came to the theatre from selfish motives , were carried away by the delusion that at last the one vital func - tion of the theatre had been discovered .

		The rest of the proponents of propaganda in the theatre fought for it sheerly as a protest against restriction , as a defense of free experi - ment .

		In the nature of the case , their brief was overstated , and their fight for recognition of the new function brought to it undeserved publicity and emphasis .

		Conservatism , too , made its inevitable mistake of opposing and thereby advertising and nourishing its new foe , enabling it to grow in less than a theatri - cal generation to such an estate that it required no defense .

		Today , the newcomer needs a check rather than a defense .

		And those who were advocates of a place for prop - aganda are forced , by the consistency of their larger view of the theatre , at least to define the limits of this particular function so as to keep it from overshadowing the more fun - damental purpose of the theatre .

		Even those of us who agree most willingly to
Granville Barker	PERSON	's free and sweeping def - inition of a play as `` anything that can be made effective upon the stage of a theatre by human agency , '' do not forget that the theatre in its highest form is one of the arts and that as one of the arts , the chief of the arts , it sinks all other aims and functions in the aim and function of beauty .

		* WOMAN ON HER OWN , FALSE GODS , and THE RED ROBE .

		By
Eugene Brieux	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Brentano 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 99 Writes
Gordon Craig	PERSON	: I can not be expected to explain to you all that the artist means by the word beautiful ; but to him it is something which has the most balance about it , the justest thing , that which rings a complete and perfect bell note .

		Not the pretty , not the smooth , not the superb always , and not always the rich , seldom the `` effective '' as we know it in the Theatre , although at times that , too , is the beautiful .

		But Beauty is so vast a thiiig , and contains nearly all other things contains even ugliness , which sometimes ceases to be what is held as ugliness , and contains harsh things , but never incomplete things .


Bernard Shaw	PERSON	himself , although he is commonly looked on as the protagonist of propaganda on the English-speaking stage , recognizes the breadth of the theatre beyond the limits of a political and sociological forum .

		It is true that in the preface to `` Man and Superman , '' while hitting back at the sim - ilarly narrow advocates of `` art for art 's sake , '' he writes : `` When your academic copier of fossils declares that art should not be didactic , all the people who have nothing to teach and all the people who do n't want to learn agree with him emphatically . ''

		And elsewhere he says that art without a social significance is worthless .

		After all , though ,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, the critic of art and music and the theatre , knows perfectly well that significance in art is all the more powerful if it is implicit instead of explicit .

		There can be no other import in these lines from `` The Sanity of Art , '' that most self-revealing of all the Shavian essays : The claim of art to our respect must stand or fall with the validity of its pretension to cultivate and refine our senses and faculties until seeing , hearing , feeling , smelling , and tasting become highly conscious and critical acts with us , protesting vehemently against ugliness , noise , discordant speech , frowzy clothing , and re-breathed air , and taking keen inter - est and pleasure in beauty , in music , and in nature , besides making us insist , as necessary for comfort and decency , on clean , wholesome , handsome fabrics to wear , and utensils of fine material and elegant workmanship to handle .

		Further , art should refine our sense of character and conduct , of justice and sympathy , greatly heightening our self-knowledge , self-control , precision of action , and considerateness , and making us intolerant of baseness , cruelty , injus - tice , and intellectual superficiality or vulgarity .

		The worthy artist or craftsman is he who serves the physical and moral senses by feeding them with pic - tures , musical compositions , pleasant houses and gar - dens , good clothes and fine implements , poems , fic - tions , essays , and dramas which call the heightened senses and the ennobled faculties into pleasurable activity .

		The great artist is he who goes a step beyond the demand , and , by supplying works of a higher beauty and a higher interest than have yet been perceived , succeeds , after a brief struggle with its strangeness , in adding this fresh extension of sense to the heritage of the race .

		The place of propaganda in the theatre of bald , clear-eyed , conscious propaganda , unhoneyed by wit , uninspired by imagination , depending on logic for its dramatic structure is a minor one .

		But it is a place that will never and should never be surrendered at least as long a , s there is a middle class of intellect that can be reached through the theatre more effectively than from the lecture platform or the street corner or the news - paper .

		This essentially middle class func - tion of the propagandist theatre was never better illustrated than
last winter	DATE	when
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` Justice '' found acclaim and reward from middle class audiences to whom the subject of prison reform was a new and burning topic .

		Those whose minds had been graduated from such a primer to more advanced subjects and who found in the play only its hint of Greek tragedy probably would not have sustained it a fortnight It is necessary to keep in mind , however , that the propagandist theatre can in no sense be considered an art form .

		Except for its use of the architectural features of the theatre and the structural and emotional mechanism of the drama , it is simply what it would be without these outward advantages : a dialectic akin to the debate , the text book , the lecture , or the sermon .

		I can conceive of a legitimate objection such as
Gordon Craig	PERSON	expresses to any use of the terms `` drama '' and `` theatre '' for such plays and the edifice which houses them .

		It may be that the thea - tre can reach its estate as an art only by the use of hard and fast definitions and discrim - inations .

		I like to think of the theatre , though , as a vast social institution with many and diverse uses and functions , some of which may not yet have been discovered or devel - oped , but an institution which reaches its full stature only as one of the arts .

		Constant care in criticism is the only safeguard against the insidious attempt on the part of the propa - gandist to be considered more important than he is .

		We must defend jealously the white flame of the art of the theatre , hedging it round so that imitators and mountebanks may not steal its rewards and use its name in vain .

		The most unmistakable contribution to recent propagandist drama is the new volume of three plays by
Eugene Brieux	PERSON	simple , unadorned Brieux , as he signs him - self , after the manner of
Caesar	PERSON	and Rameses and
Benrimo	LOCATION	.

		This second instalment from the author of `` Damaged Goods '' is in much the same sociological vein as the volume through which he was introduced to the American public
several years ago	DATE	.

		`` Woman On Her Own '' -LRB- `` La Femme Seule '' -RRB- makes about as dreary a muddle of the problem of woman in business as the average congres - sional report does of a strike at
Paterson	LOCATION	or 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	15
Leadville	LOCATION	; `` False Gods '' -LRB- `` La Foi '' -RRB- just misses imaginative importance by the play - wright 's inherent lack of imagination and his insistence on arguing a spiritual and mys - tical conception as if it were a question of damages for the loss of a leg ; `` The Red Kobe '' -LRB- `` La Kobe Rouge '' -RRB- , long one of the playwright 's most praised works and now for the first time available in English translation , is revealed as a theatrical rather than a dra - matic treatment of a murder case set forth to bait the unwary into a consideration of the errors and faults of the French judicial system .

		It is manifestly unfair to be peevish because
Monsieur Brieux	PERSON	was born without an imag - ination .

		It is just as unfair to try to read into his plays subtleties and nuances and intentions that never existed in the play - wright 's mind .

		He has chosen three texts out of contemporary life : woman in business , religion , and the administration of justice ; and on these texts he preaches three sermons or delivers three speeches just as frankly as if he were standing in the pulpit or on the ros - trum .

		Propaganda they are and as propa - ganda they must be judged if they are to be judged honestly .

		But it is hard to smother the vision of what each play might have been , especially `` False Gods , '' which just misses greatness , if it had been impelled by a whiter flame and the imagination of the artist .

		.

		`` Woman On Her Own '' is easily the least interesting , the least clear-cut and the least logical of all the plays .

		It is therefore by far the least successful of the three , because propaganda must be judged by its power to hold the attention , its clarity , and its logic .

		Those who know `` Damaged Goods , '' espe - cially those who saw it played , had to admit the gripping power of its logic .

		In `` Woman On Her Own , '' Brieux shows no such grasp of his subject .

		Either the problem of woman and labor is in an extremely primitive state in
France	LOCATION	and the play is a page out of past history for us , or else the playwright him - self has not come to any definite impressions or conclusions on his subject .

		His story is simply that of a young girl , too independent to attach herself to bankrupt foster-parents , who flounders miserably in literary and in - dustrial endeavors , refuses several kinds of marriage , even one of love , and takes the train back to
Paris	LOCATION	and a future on which the curtain is drawn .

		Brieux 's inference seems to be that Woman On Her Own is an inconceivable condition .

		Millions of Ameri - cans know that is not true .

		And war has brought to
France	LOCATION	and French women the same knowledge .

		Thirty years ago when the woman problem was just emerging , such an aimless play might have been excusable , mak - ing up in the novelty of its subject matter what it lacked in interest and illumination .

		On the contrary , it is one of
Monsieur Brieux	PERSON	's latest compositions , although ante - dating the war .

		`` False Gods . ''

		on the other hand , is splen - didly conscious of its purpose , coherent and dramatically relentless .

		Through a strangely exotic Egyptian atmosphere and through characters out of an ages-old civilisation , it hurls an insistent question at the religious hierarchy not only of that bygone time but of to-day .

		It is conscious , didactic dramatic propaganda at its best .

		In conception it is so fine a play , in fact , that it compels regret that poetic imagination has not carried it up to the heights of Dunsany or
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		By just that shortcoming it yields even to a little one act play , `` The Broken God , '' by
Hortense Flexner	PERSON	, of
Louisville	LOCATION	, produced by
Samuel A. Eliot , Jr.	PERSON	,
last winter	DATE	at the Little Theatre in
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, a strange bit of writ - ing , with its setting on the planet of forgotten deities , propounding the agnostic question by subtle but vivid poetic suggestion .

		Satni , returning from foreign lands to
Egypt	LOCATION	of the
Middle Empire	ORGANIZATION	, dares question the power of
Isis	ORGANIZATION	and the priests of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	religion .

		When the people see him violate sacred places and sacred names unscathed , many follow him as a new god or the inter - preter of one , although he insists that he has no divine power .

		His hold on the people is so strong that the high priest tries to come to terms with him , offering to release Yaouma ,
Satni	ORGANIZATION	's betrothed , from the annual sacrifice to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, if he will leave the crowd their gods .

		In a tense scene in the temple , the priest entrusts to Satni the mechanism for working the head of the stone idol in response to the annual prayers of the populace .

		Over - come at last by pity for their pleading faith in the miracle , Satni presses the lever .

		From that point to the end , `` False Gods '' is the tragedy of a broken ideal , the cynical tragedy of human weakness vs. human strength .

		`` The Red Robe , '' for which the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	crowned Brieux in
1909	DATE	, is also propaganda of a high order .

		In it the playwright replaces the exotic atmosphere of `` False Gods '' and the logic of `` Damaged Goods '' with a frame - work of deftly contrived melodrama to hold the interest while he plies his propagandist protest against the French judicial system .

		The story , therefore , is negligible .

		The theme alone is important : the injustice of any con - nection between a judge 's advancement and his success in winning convictions .

		The tech -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 nicality of the entire play somewhat reduces its value as propaganda in this country where the range of its application is limited to the political maneuvers of state and circuit judges for reelection .

		Aside from that , it is little more signicant than melodrama of the order of `` Within the Law . ''

		The English versions of the plays have been made by Mrs.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
J. F. Fagan	PERSON	.

		and
A. Bernard Miall	PERSON	and are idiomatic , although more British , of course , than Amer - ican .

		There is no escaping the feeling on com - pleting the volume that even Brieux , who is not a poet and does not pretend to be one , might have written greater plays in all three cases if he had not been obsessed by the prop - agandist delusion .

		The spectacle of a crafts - man working in inferior material is always disheartening , and that spectacle perhaps more than any other is to be found in the panorama of propaganda in the theatre .

		The
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	I met and talked with in
Adelphi	LOCATION	Ter - race is not the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	you picture from `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' or `` Major Barbara '' or any of his plays , unless it be that phenomenal and always brutally smothered third act of `` Man and Superman . ''

		The
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	who expounded to me the glories of
Chartres	LOCATION	cathedral and of twelfth century Gothic is not the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	who has twisted himself into a preacher for the public gaze .

		And who can read
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	from first to last without bowing the head in sorrow when the master poet of `` Brand '' and `` Peer Gynt '' cramped his hand and his imagination to the prosaic task of the social dramas !

		The artist is teacher , but the mere teacher is neither artist nor teacher in the finest sense .

		WHAT is EDUCATION ?

		* With all deference to the gentlemen who i write our most efficient fiction and their view that there are no critics in
America	LOCATION	, it must be admitted that our age is somewhat given to analysis , to the examination of the scaf - folding on which it rests , and to the con - version of said scaffolding into a scaffold for many a moribund tradition .

		`` What is beer ? ''

		and `` What is Shakespeare ? ''

		have a certain spectacular interest entirely wanting in `` What is education ? ''

		; yet the latter mild inquiry has in it some high explosives which are likely to mark the
first quarter	DATE	of the * DEMOCRACY AJJD EDUCATION : An Introduction to the
Philosophy of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Dewey	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Twentieth Century as revolutionary .

		There have not been many epochal stages in the his - tory of education in historic times .

		Plato represents the first great influence with his recognition that a society can be stably organ - ized only when each individual is educated along the line for which nature best fits him .


Rousseau	PERSON	gave momentum to individual de - velopment with his call back to `` Nature '' ; society was corrupt and artificial ; all good and right impulses were within , needing only to be released .

		`` The emancipated individual was to become the organ and agent of a com - prehensive and progressive society '' .

		Today the spiral , so well known in social evolution , is completing itself .

		Back from the individ - ualism of Kousseau we are returning to a restatement of the social ideal of education asserted by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, but with a difference .

		Plato 's environment and in fact his ideal was a society of rigid class lines , essentially aris - tocratic ; so his ideal for education was a hopeless one .

		To-day the growth of real democracy is gradually bringing its realiza - tion to fulfillment , and for two decades in
America	LOCATION	influences have been quietly at work making experiments in various model schools which are rudely threatening orthodox tra - ditions .

		The greatest single factor in this revolution is an American teacher who has vitalized hundreds of disciples in his classes and is now reaching thousands through his books .

		He is of course none other than Pro- fessor
John Dewey	PERSON	, whose recently published treatise , `` Democracy and Education , '' sum - marizes in an admirably adequate form the results of his long study and teaching .

		The book is not prepossessing in appear - ance .

		A dull brick-red octavo of four hundred pages labelled on the front `` Text-book Series in Education '' is not an inspiring sight .

		An admiring critic has before remarked that the Democracy of
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	is apparent in the mis - cellaneity and uniform commonplaceness of the physical make-up of his books .

		However the author can well indulge a taste for osten - tatious severity , securely aware that
Samuel Butler	PERSON	to the contrary , `` for purposes of mere reading one book is '' not `` as good as another . ''

		Although `` Democracy and Education '' is conceived and written as a text-book in chap - ters of convenient length , ending in each case with a summary , it is not so easy to summa - rize the whole book .

		The author himself has in the chapter `` Philosophy of Education '' made an analysis of his discussion somewhat as follows : The first chapters , 1-7 , deal with education as a social need and function , their purpose `` to outline the general features of 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	education as the process by which social groups maintain their continuous existence . ''

		It was shown that the kind of society aiming at its perpetuation must be taken into con - sideration and the democratic criterion was adopted for the subsequent discussion .

		Chap - ters 8-17 , inclusive , make up the second part .

		On the basis of the democratic criterion they develop the main principles of method and subject matter .

		The third part , chapters
18-23	DATE	, examines the present limitations of the actual realization of the ideal , mainly
spring	DATE	- ing from the `` notion that experience consists of a variety of segregated domains or inter - ests , each having its own independent value , material and method , each checking every other . ''

		The last three chapters define Phi - losophy of Education and review theories of knowledge and morals .

		The third and the last parts , the momen - tum of the previous chapters behind them , are naturally of most interest .

		Dewey here attacks the various dualisms that have been set up with vicious results : `` labor and leisure , '' `` intellectual and practical , '' `` cul - tural and vocational , '' `` physical and social , '' `` The individual and the world , '' `` duty and interest . ''

		Dualism , if we interpret Profes - sor Dewey correctly , is the devil .

		-LRB- It is unquestionably true that the capital D is a product of metaphysical dualism . -RRB-

		The first pair , labor and leisure , evoke the following : `` If democracy has a moral and ideal mean - ing , it is that a social return be demanded from all and that opportunity for develop - ment of distinctive capacities be afforded all . ''

		`` The problem of education in a democratic society is to do away with the dualism and to construct a course of studies which makes thought a guide of free practice for all and which makes leisure a reward of accepting responsibility for service , rather than a state of exemption from it . ''

		From this it would appear that Professor Dewey reads into de - mocracy , not more than the spirit implies certainly , but more than the dictionary allows .

		Such a society is not merely demo - cratic ; it is socialistic .

		So the dualism involving culture .

		`` What is called inner is simply that which does not connect with others which is not capable of free and full communication .

		What is termed spiritual culture has usually been futile , with something rotten about it , because it has been conceived as a thing which a man might have internally and therefore exclusively . ''

		`` As a matter of fact any subject is cultural in the degree in which it is apprehended in its widest possible range of meanings . ''

		But what is education ?

		It is surely time for that question to find an answer .

		On page 89 is
Dewey	LOCATION	's definition illustrative of his fine technical skill in framing proper bounds of ideas : '' It is that reconstruction or reorgani - zation of experience which adds to the mean - ing of experience , and which increases ability to direct the course of subsequent experi - ence . ''

		How far this is from mere knowledge or mere training or mere skill will be appar - ent on a moment 's reflection .

		Consider the lecture plan of instruction borrowed from the university and now even operated on the col - lege freshmen , in the light of this view of education .

		The pupils are deliberately held to rehearsing material in the exact form in which the older person conceives it ... Teaching them ceases to be an educative process for the teacher .

		At most he sim - ply learns to improve his existing technique ... Hence both teaching and learning tend to become conventional and mechanical with all the nervous strain on both sides therein implied .

		Such instruction handed out to the imma - ture student curseth him that gives and him that takes .

		The power of framing clear , purposeful , meaningful definitions is with little doubt the most striking feature of
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	's style .

		Note a few .

		`` When fairly remote results of a defi - nite character are foreseen and enlist persist - ent effort for their accomplishment , play passes into work . ''

		`` Work which remains permeated with the play attitude is art in quality if not in conventional design . ''

		`` Phi - losophy is thinking what the known demands of us what responsive attitude it exacts . ''

		-LRB- Of the several hundred definitions , so-called , of philosophy which have come under exam - ination this will be found nearly if not quite the most satisfactory . -RRB-

		`` We call it end when it marks off the future direction of the activ - ity in which we are engaged ; means when it marks off the present direction . ''

		A pleasant trait of style is the felicitous use of common idiom to give life to rather stiff thinking .

		`` There is no such thing as over-intellectuality , but there is such a thing as a one-sided intellectuality .

		A person ' takes it out ' as we say in considering the conse - quences of proposed lines of action . ''

		Again , `` The terms ` mental realization ' and ` appre - ciation ' are more elaborate names for the realizing sense of a thing .

		It is not possible to define these ideas except by synonyms , like ` coming home to one , ' ` really taking it in , ' etc. '' Probably no writer on philosoph - ical subjects ever reached the public without a degree of this quality , but not even the late Professor
James	PERSON	was able to resort to this method of `` speaking with the vulgar '' when
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 103 occasion demanded with less imputation of sophistry .

		On the other hand it must be admitted that when the author departs from the realm of definition his care for the nice - ties of English suggests his great contempo - rary only in its differences .

		As a philosophical discussion one point at least is handled unsatisfactorily .

		Wherever the question of knowledge or truth is involved , the veritable heel of Achilles for Pragmatism , there is a disconcerting confusion found no - where else in this admirable book .

		On page 345 we read .

		`` What is taken for knowledge for fact and truth may not be such .

		But everything which is assumed without ques - tion , which is taken for granted in our inter - course with one another and nature is what , at the given time , is called knowledge . ''

		-LRB- Author 's italics . -RRB-

		There is vacillation in the first sentence : it does not hold with
Dewey	PERSON	's view expressed elsewhere , that the truth is whatever `` works '' .

		Certainly it is hard to join it even by a `` but '' to the second sen - tence .

		Then on page 393 we read , `` The development of the experimental method as the method of getting knowledge and of mak - ing sure it is knowledge , and not mere opin - ion ... , '' and we feel sure that Professor
Dewey	PERSON	.

		like the rest of us , believes that there is a certain objectivity to knowledge , that there is a difference between assumptions that are true and assumptions that are false , even though they may for a time work .

		This is too big a book to be epitomized ; it is a book for study , and it is to be sincerely hoped that the purposes of `` recitation '' to which colleges and normal schools will put it may not altogether prevent its serious read - ing even by the prospective teachers in those schools .

		This is a period of reconstruction -LRB- a word Dewey loves -RRB- and
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	is its prophet .

		He has already been termed one of the `` Major Prophets of Today '' ; it seems hardly too much to conceive that the Twenty - first Century will study three great stages in educational theory ,

Rousseau	PERSON	, and

		NEW TRANSLATIONS OF SLAVIC FICTION .

		* The H. ``
W. Wilson	PERSON	Company announce a vol - ume of interest not only to the general reader , but to librarians in particular , a volume entitled `` Libraries : Addresses and Essays , '' by
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, the well-known head of the
Newark	LOCATION	iX .

		J. -RRB- Free Public Library .

		Harper and
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	announce for early autumn publication a new novel by
Margaret Deland	PERSON	, the first long : novel since her writing of `` The Iron Woman . ''

		The war has as yet accomplished nothing more important for art than the stimulation of Anglo-Saxon interest in Slavic literature .

		The new series of novels and short stories being issued by Mr.
Alfred Knopf	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	, besides other single volumes from vari - ous English and American publishers , are all significant of an influence on our own writing that can not be unfruitful .

		Some of the books are by authors already partly known in this country ,
Gogol	LOCATION	,
Tchekhov	LOCATION	,
Andreyev	LOCATION	; others are by men totally unfamiliar in English ,
Lermontov	PERSON	,
Goncharov	PERSON	,
Dantchenko	PERSON	; but all are worth looking into as expressions of a genius none too well known here , though not all are of equal human value or of equally wide appeal .

		Most remarkable of the recent translations are the two volumes by
Goncharov	PERSON	, an artist almost of the same stature as the great trio ,
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and Dostoievsky , who are so much better known to us .

		`` Oblomov , '' which
Kropotkin	PERSON	calls `` one of the profound - est productions of the
last century	DATE	, '' is such a classic in
Russia	LOCATION	that its title has taken on a kind of proverbial significance , the hero 's name having become a symbol of the national temperament .

		The book is merely the biog - raphy of this hero , given in pictures and descriptions of mood rather than in narra - tive of violent action .

		From the opening chapter with its unforgetable odor of a stuffy room and an uncared-for house , through the restrospective visions of Oblomov 's childhood home , the sunny , sleepy , tumble-down great estate of his parents in a remote province , to the final sight of him as the supine pet of his landlady , the protagonist is never once really upright on his feet , not even in i his brief passion for
Olga	PERSON	, another of the large-souled women who move through Rus - sian literature , the finest of their kind .

		One recalls `` Virgin Soil . ''

		where Turgenev pre - sents in his central figures the same contrast between the man and the woman , but he fills out his theme more abundantly , coloring it with action of a more externalized sort and with minor personages of independent inter - * OBLOMOV .

		104 THE DIAL est. .

		Goncharov absolutely subordinates detail to the communication of the hero 's semi-par - alyzed mood and its reflections in his sur - roundings and upon his few , his very few , associates .

		`` Oblomov '' therefore has a surprising unity of tone ; it stays in the memory like a well - composed landscape rather than as a human drama .

		`` The Precipice , '' on the contrary , tense with the emotion of at least four prin - cipal characters and rapidly moving with an almost melodramatic plot , is a much more usual kind of novel .

		It is not like the other book a tour de force , giving the impression of being written from within the hero 's mind ; it presents a complicated series of relations carefully analyzed from without and once or twice linked by a somewhat desperate wrest - ing of probability in motives .

		Yet improba - bility is troublesome only in the case of Mark , so conventional a type of unconventional morality as to be readily labelled the villain of the tale ; the two heroines , old and young , are equally interesting and convincing ; the sensitive would-be artist ,
Raisky	PERSON	, from whose point of view the story is consistently told , is individualized with great success .

		The book throbs with life and feeling and is as glori - ously innocent of thesis as of scientific inten - tion .

		Compared to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and Dostoievsky , its author seems quite uninterested in practi - cal judgments ; like Turgenev he is fascinated simply by the process of analysis and pre - sentation , not moved to it by reforming zeal .

		On the whole all these Russians are as objective as Balzac or Maupassant .

		Perhaps at heart they feel that revolt against the complex forces of life is futile ; such is the conclusion of a humble philosopher in Gar - shin 's story , `` The Signal , '' even though he refuses to stop at ultimate nihilism because he protests that `` to put everything on God and sit and suffer means , Brother , being not a man but an animal . ''

		This determination to study and to understand both conditions and causes does not lead to much assumption of individual responsibility toward society or even of individual freedom , but it gives depth and richness to the art that expresses it .

		It finds this scientific passion for analy - sis a terrible reflection in the short stories of
Garshin	LOCATION	, fearful studies of physical and mental torture created by a mind so sensitive that it became unhinged by the difficulties of adjustment to life .

		`` Four Days , '' the auto - biographical reminiscences of a wounded sol - dier who lay that time untended among the dead after a great battle , is too nakedly frightful to be read at all in the sinister light thrown on it by our daily dispatches from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Other tales hold an even more haunting weight of spiritual misery , the courtesan 's story of her life , `` Nadjeja Nicolaivena , '' for instance , which reminds the reader of
Tchekhov	ORGANIZATION	's ironic study , `` The Fit , '' in the volume called `` The Bet , and Other Tales . ''

		Tchekhov , however , would by average read - ers be considered less terrible than
Garshin	PERSON	, simply because he is more various and more subtle , sometimes more suggestively pro- found .

		His short stories in the two volumes , `` The Bet '' and `` Russian Silhouettes , '' and the tales by Andreyev collected under the title of `` The Little Angel and Other Stories , '' are the most delightful of recent translations from the Russian .

		National traits and cus - toms are revealed incidentally , but with re - markable penetration ; comedy and tragedy , and every shade of mood between , vitalize all three volumes .

		Andreyev 's touching story in which a poor boy 's one treasure , a little waxen angel , slowly melts upon the stove w r hile the lad sleeps , is offset by a merry jest of one of

		ESTIMATES IN ART .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 105 his distinction .

		Insofar as his criticism is judgment , on the other hand , it is all too often wilful , opinionated , impressionistic .

		A man with unusually wide background , especially in the arts -LRB- as the title of the present volume suggests -RRB- , he writes with charm and subtlety , !

		sometimes with elevation , but rarely with ; weight or penetration .

		His control over his background , one might say , is emotional rather than intellectual .

		His style , of course , corresponds with these characteristics it is deft , nimble , accomplished , skilfully colored , equally capable of sustained flow and epi - grammatic neatness .

		Thus ,
Watts	ORGANIZATION	sees `` as if with tradition in his eyesight '' ; the music of
Strauss	PERSON	consists of `` many voices crying out of all the corners of the orchestra , and seem - ing to strive after an articulate speech with the anguish of dumb things tortured '' -LRB- who has put more of
Strauss	PERSON	into a few words ? -RRB-

		; | the pictures of
Degas	LOCATION	, again , `` are miracu - j lous pieces of drawing , which every artist j must admire , as he would admire a drawing j by
Leonardo	LOCATION	; but there they end , where the j Leonardo drawing does but begin . ''

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's themes in this volume are in the main of the nineteenth century : `` The Painting of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB- a review of
MacColl	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` Watts , '' `` The Ideas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		The chapters deal - ing with music represent the most pains - taking study as well as the keenest pleasure .

		Before writing on `` The Ideas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Symons	PERSON	clearly did some pon - derous , if not always enlightening , reading .

		`` The Problem of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, '' whom he holds literary rather than musical , is per - haps the most thoughtful of the essays on j composers .

		At times , in these essays , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is by no means at the center .

		Ac - cepting
Pater	PERSON	's romantic dogma , `` All art constantly aspires toward the condition of music , '' he tells us that `` Music comes speak - ing the highest wisdom in a language which our reason does not understand , because it is | older and deeper and closer to us than our reason '' in which the three adjectives surely need careful scrutiny .

		`` Why is it , '' he asks elsewhere , somewhat surprisingly , `` that music is not limited in regard to length , as a poem is , a lyrical poem , to which music is most akin ?

		Is it not because the ecstacy of music can be maintained indefinitely and at its high - est pitch , while the ecstacy of verse is short - ened by what is definite in words ? ''

		And this of
Purcell	ORGANIZATION	is surely delicious :
Germany	LOCATION	, he says , `` has done nothing supreme except in music , and in music nothing supreme has been done outside
Germany	LOCATION	since the music of
Purcell	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		On the other hand , despite his predilection for the Superman in
Wagner	PERSON	's genius , he apparently has a more whole-souled enjoyment of Beethoven ; and the following , on the
Pastoral Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, manifests not a little hard sense as well as sympathy : In the whole of the
Pastoral Symphony	ORGANIZATION	one cer - tainly gets an atmosphere which is the musical equivalent of skies and air and country idleness and the delight of sunlight , not because a bird cries here and there , and a storm mutters obviously among the double basses , but because a feeling , constantly at the roots of his being , and present in some form in almost all his music , came for once to be concen - trated a little deliberately , as if in a dedication , by way of gratitude .

		All through there is humor , and the realism is a form of it , the bird 's notes on the instruments , the thunder and wind and the flowing of water , as certainly as the village band .

		Here , as everywhere , it was , as he said , `` Expression of feel - ing rather than painting '' that he aimed at ; and it would be curious if these humorous asides , done with childish good-humor , should have helped to lead the way to much serious modern music , in which natural sounds , and all the accidents of actual noise , have been solemnly and conscientiously imitated for theii 1 own sakes .

		A more balanced equipment of critical fac - ulties , expressed in a style that is thoroughly serviceable rather than eminent , is every - where manifested in the `` Estimates of Art '' by
Frank Jewett Mather	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Art here means painting , and the painting ranges from
Bot	ORGANIZATION	- ticelli to Color-Prints of
Japan	LOCATION	* .

		Professor Mather , like Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, has a wide back - ground of knowledge in the arts , especially , in his case , in painting ; and this background is utilized , not only by flitting emotion that senses analogy and illustration and touch - stones , but also by a mind that moves with ease and firmness in an endeavor to make distinctions and estimate values .

		He has a deep interest in personality , exemplified most readily by the pointed biographical sketches , in the French manner , that occur in most of the essays .

		He has also an instinct for the critical task proper , the denotation of what is excellent and of what is inferior , and the relation of the artist with tradition .

		A bril - liant example of this poised criticism is `` The Painting of Sorolla . ''

		Admitting with pleas - ure the man 's extraordinary gusto , Mr.
Mather	PERSON	deplores his coarseness , his lack of `` refinement of workmanship . ''

		his indulgence in `` big sketches '' rather than finished paint - ings .

		Sorolla `` has the genial , roving vision of every man '' ; `` he sees much as the kodak or picnicking mankind see , and that is surely the ground of his enormous popularity . ''

		An extraordinary vogue Sorolla certainly had , and in some quarters still has .

		The freshness of his color , the novelty of his drawing and choice of subject , held the public enthralled ; 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	and no one who has seen his pictures can for - get them .

		Yet it is true that , except for one 's love of color as color -LRB- a worthy instinct in all of us , according to
Kuskin	PERSON	-RRB- , one does not go back to Sorolla with satisfaction his paint - ing does not yield the serene contentment of authentic `` high art . ''

		It is not only that he lacks the reflective element , but also , as Mr.
Mather	PERSON	makes very clear , that his pictures are the result of rambling improvisation , rather than exquisite insight .

		Two of Mr.
Mather	PERSON	's `` Estimates '' stand out , not so much as the disinterested judg - ment of a well-informed critic , as the warm , though guarded , enthusiasm of a fellow - craftsman , those on Watts and La Farge .

		Watts brings back to him , if anything , `` too vividly , '' `` that winter of the
New York	LOCATION	exhi - bition of
1884	DATE	, when , as a lad , I first caught the truth that great painting may arouse and calm one as great poetry does or noble music . ''

		He proceeds to analyze the motives and pas - sions of this typically Victorian painter with a solidarity of statement that leaves Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's essay on the same theme far behind ; his conclusion being that `` in the resolute attack upon the fundamental problems of form and color , and in a solution personal , meaningful , and instinct with a peculiar solemn beauty ,
Watts	PERSON	may surely be ranked with the very few great technicians of his century . ''

		Of La Farge ,
Professor Mather	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , a hearty admirer La Farge , `` the most learned painter of our times , '' who `` restored to dignity among us the art of mural decoration , '' and `` invented a new and beautiful technic for stained glass , '' not to mention vaguer but equally signal distinc - tions .

		In industrial
America	LOCATION	of the nine - teenth century , he displayed the versatility and ardor of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	artist : of which a striking illustration is his renewal of the tradition of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	workshop .

		The following passage is instructive , in a day when painting , flying off at a tangent , is fast melting into the inane : From
1876	DATE	-LRB- when he organized that gallant emergency squad which under cruel conditions of time and convenience decorated
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	, Bos - ton -RRB- Mr. La Farge always had about him a corps of assistants , ranging from intelligent artisans to accomplished artists .

		Upon all of them he impressed his will so completely that even their invention cast itself in his forma .

		One who was long his chief assistant told me that there were scores of drawings and sketches about the studio which might be his or the master 's he honestly could not tell .

		A well - known art critic pleaded that the cartoon of the `` Confucius '' -LRB- every stroke of which was executed by this assistant -RRB- should be preserved in a museum as an imperishable memorial of La Farge 's handiwork .

		His workshop dealt impartially with designs for glass or wall , accepting also humble decorative jobs , and drawing in on occasion wood-carvers and inlayers , sculptors , and even the casual visitor .

		And here I am reminded of a club discussion con - cerning sculpture by proxy , the subletting of con - tracts , the employment of students ' sketches , etc. .

		Mr. La Farge diverted an argument that was becom - ing too emphatic by the following anecdote : `` The other day , '' he said , `` I was painting on the garden of the ' Confucius ' while my chief assistant was working on one of the heads .

		In came
V. I.	PERSON	, and I set him at a bit of drapery .

		Time was valu - able , you see .

		L. looked in , and I set him at a bit of foreground foliage .

		I saw that the dead coloring of the sky needed deepening .

		At that moment my secretary ,
Miss B.	LOCATION	, entered with a letter .

		I gave her a broad brush , showed her how to charge it and sweep it with a mechanical stroke , and against her protest she , too , was enlisted . ''

		With that ineffable restrained smile of his he turned to me and asked : `` Now , whose picture waa that ? ''

		And I was lucky enough to blunder out : `` It was a fine La Farge . ''

FOERSTER	ORGANIZATION	.

		A BRILLIANT ECONOMIC STUDY .

		* There appeared in
1902	DATE	a book in two vol - umes called `` The Bourgeois . ''

		The author was
Werner Sombart	PERSON	, one of the newer lights in the firmament of economic scholarship in
Germany	LOCATION	, and a star of a very different order from the customary luminaries in the dark reaches of that intellectual barren .

		Sombart , although a professor and loaded with infor - mation , neither thinks nor writes like one .

		His touch is light , his style incisive , and he has ideas .

		That his ideas are often fanciful and far-fetched , even from the regions of that conceited absurdity and puffiness of German social feeling and judgment of which
H. S. Chamberlain	PERSON	is the Pooh-bah , is irrelevant .

		They turn the `` dismal science '' into a joy - ous adventure , and transmute statistics into a vision of life .

		Mr.
Epstein	PERSON	, in his transla - tion , has not only succeeded in transmitting many of these qualities of the original ; he has added something of his own , a quality of staccato rhythm , an intense shrillness .

		At the hands of no man has economics become so like romance in feeling , as it has ever been in content .

		In order to understand the capitalistic temperament , the Bourgeois as a social type , Sombart points out , it is first necessary to define its nature and to trace its develop - ment , then to apprehend its causes .

		Its na - ture is the sum and substance of the mental states that accompany and express the eco - nomic enterprise of the modern world .

		It * THE QUINTESSENCE OF CAPITALISM .

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 107 defines itself distinctively in contrast with the `` precapitalist ^ man . ''

		The latter is the j `` natural man . ''

		He has no interest in money , i no concern in calculation .

		When he did work , he lived in his work as an artist , mak - ing for the joy of making , not to sell .

		But he did n't care much about work .

		He was a j greater holiday maker .

		Such wants as he had were standardized for him by the economy of his social class , and if he refused to pass below that , he neither sought to rise above it .

		Not so with the
Bourgeois	PERSON	.

		Above all , he is gold-greedy .

		He wants money , and his life is at its foundations the pursuit of money .

		Commerce , treasure-seeking , usury , the occu - pation of public office , alchemy , were among the methods used to get it .

		Sombart classi - fies all the methods broadly as acquisition by force , by magic , by financial speculation , and by invention .

		All of these involved under - taking of some sort ; the execution of a plan of exploitation involving the cooperation of many people .

		European history is particu - larly marked , however , by four distinct forms of it : the martial , the landholding , as the manorial system , the state , and the church .

		The attitude of mind which these express `` the spirit of enterprise and the desire for gain '' involves furthermore the `` middle - class virtues . ''

		They are recorded for the first time in
1450	DATE	by
Alberti	PERSON	in his `` Del Go - verno degli Famiglia . ''

		They are the virtues of industry - , frugality , and honesty , the very ones stressed by
Defoe	PERSON	and by
Franklin	PERSON	, to say nothing of
Rockefeller	ORGANIZATION	and other worthy captains of industry .

		The old bourgeois dif - fered however in one fundamental respect from the modern business man : he regarded the purpose of production to be the satisfac - tion of wants ; the modern business man considers it to be the making of money .

		Pri - marily he wishes to see his business thrive , but as it can not thrive without a surplus , his acquisitiveness is forced upon him .

		In other respects he has the same interests and wishes as a child ; he is enamorored of physical big - ness : is always on the move seeking to break records , always in pursuit of novelty , and always fond of the sense of power over inferiors .

		So the capitalistic spirit has been charac - terized , and its development traced .

		What are its causes ?

		Sombart finds four : the bio - logical , the moral , the ethico-religious , and the social .

		His discussion of the biological causes is the most fanciful , and his discussion of the religio-ethical the most strained .

		Both are permeated by the spirit of the absurd mythology of
Chamberlain	PERSON	and both are as stimulating as they are amusing .

		Biologically men may be classified , Sombart thinks , as spenders and savers ; open men and closed men .

		On the same basis he might say human beings might be classified as males and fe - males , the former being spenders , the latter savers .

		As individuals are so classified so may races be ; consequently some races , like the Romans ,
Normans	ORGANIZATION	, Jews , and Scotch are capitalistic , others like the Celts and Goths are not .

		If they become so , it is because of the infiltration of alien capitalistic blood , or the domination of the `` saving '' portion of the population .

		Analogously it might be argued that the matriarchate was a capitalistic soci - ety and that the enfranchisement of women must mean the perpetuation of capitalism .

		The whole region is dark and unmapped , and speculation here is determined by the will-to - believe rather than by experience .

		Sombart is something of a socialist .

		Con - cerning the future of capitalism he believes with
Karl Marx	PERSON	that it must break down of its own weight .

		The spontaneous disintegra - tion of the economic system is , he thinks , re - enforced by the growth of bureaucracy and the decline of birthrate .

		Whatever one may think of the outcome of the book , its learning , its brilliancy , and per - suasiveness are unique in this field , and even more unique is that detachment from so pres - ent and all-embracing an economic system which renders possible to see and to judge it as a whole .

		American Men of Letters ; Their Nature and Nurture '' -LRB-
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	,
Longman	PERSON	's ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , makes a commendable attempt to evaluate some of the factors that have influenced the mental develop - ment of the thousand most eminent literati born in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	between the years
1639	DATE	and
1850	DATE	.

		The writer draws his inferences from a large mass of data with a reserve that is not always noticable in studies of this kind .

		He is lead to believe that while nature , in the form of heredity , plays a far greater role than he had at first imagined , it nevertheless counts for little in the absence of favorable environmental conditions .

		`` It happens that there have been three especially important factors in the development of American men of letters , a good heredity , furnishing stock capable of being developed , an education adequate to develop latent ability , and a social environment furnishing incentive to the naturally endowed and amply educated to turn their attention to litera - ture . ''

		Not the least valuable part of the work is 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	an appendix covering fifty-four pages and con - taining an epitome of biography for
American Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		Very interesting and instructive is A study in , r , , , , , j r i genetics .

		a little book by
Raymond Pearl	PERSON	entitled `` Modes of Research in Genetics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Compiled largely from earlier papers and lectures , it is somewhat lack - ing in unity and balance but it does contain some very lucid discussions of the possibilities and limi - tations of the current methods of attacking prob - lems in heredity .

		For the special student in this field it will prove a helpful and inspiring critique and for the general reader it offers an insight into the methodology of an important branch of science .

		A bit of refreshing fictton .

		of popular fiction is generally too inclined to court suc - cegg jjy appeal to what may be called our `` gilded '' sensibilities , giving us highly colored tales of `` society , '' in which the easy super - latives of `` paper '' emotion are the dominating factor .

		It is therefore a pleasure to find in
Anne Shannon Monroe	PERSON	's `` Happy Valley '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- an atmosphere of actual human experience .

		This is the record of a young man who goes west , though not to the west of the `` movies , - '' where he gives battle , not only with the forces of nature , but with the inherited force of intemperance .

		The story is so simply and vividly told that it becomes one of personal interest to the reader , who can not fail to enter into the life of the little pioneer settlement with as keen an interest as if the settlers were his own friends .

		The spirit of the book is one of fine exhilaration bred by arduous labor , by love of wide horizons , and the indomitable will of man 's finest instincts .

		It is certain to please those readers who seek entertainment , rather than litera - ture , in their lighter reading .

		in
England	LOCATION	and in
America	LOCATION	Shakespearean complaint has been made of late against the excessive concern of present-day scholarship with sixteenth century drama .

		There is perhaps good ground for the remonstrance ; but readers of Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's elaborate review `` Shakespeare 's Theatre '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- of theatrical conditions in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time are likely to be considerably surprised by the evidence of the very great advance in knowledge of this subject achieved since the
year 1900	DATE	.

		The new documents discovered within the past dozen years by men like Professors
Wallace	PERSON	, Feuillerat , and
Moore Smith	PERSON	; the admirable editorial methods of the supporters of the
Malone Society	ORGANIZATION	and kindred academies ; and the multiplication of dramatic monographs by
Chambers	ORGANIZATION	,
Murray	PERSON	,
Feuillerat	PERSON	, and many others , have made it possible for Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	, working in the new light , to produce the first book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stage which combines definiteness of statement with demonstrable accuracy .

		A book on this subject is of course particularly seasonable in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tercentenary year , and it comes with equal fitness from
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, which under the influ - ence of Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	and Professor
Brancler Matthews	PERSON	has especially signalized itself by researches of this nature .

		Certain parts of the volume , as the author is careful to note , amount to revised summaries of well known
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	dis - sertations produced under the writer 's direction , but there is no slighting of the work of foreign students and no lack of independent judgment , though Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	wisely attempts to restrict himself in general to the statement of facts already pretty definitely established .

		As a whole the book well attains the aim announced in the preface of effecting `` an amicable approxi - mation toward agreement in essentials '' regarding the Shakespearean theatre , and it should be wel - comed as the most readable and authoritative com - pendium of Elizabethan stagecraft yet extant .

		The chapters on the leading companies in the reigns of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
James I.	PERSON	respectively are particularly convenient for reference , while the more general discussions of `` The Playhouses , '' `` The Dramatists , '' `` Actors and Acting , '' and `` The Audience '' should win the interest of a wider pub - lic .

		The well-chosen illustrations add to the volume 's beauty of style and format .

		, The proof that there is something system * f original and positive value about the Wirt system of education at
Gary	PERSON	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, is that it raises up so many enthu - siastic friends , some , though not many , bitter enemies , and so few calm critics .

		Most investiga - tors , casual and thorough , seem in their reports under an obsession that the Royal Road to Educa - tion has at last been discovered .

		A negligible num - ber find , it is true , a strong Mephistophelian odor in the vocational emphasis ; but none of the reports that have come under the writer 's notice has maintained the note of enthusiasm and at the same time succeeded in pointing out the shal - lows .

		`` The Gary Schools '' by
Randolph S. Bourne	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- is no exception .

		This book is by all odds the most complete study yet pub - lished by an investigator aiming at interpretation and evaluation .

		Its clear analysis , admirable arrangement of material and adequate style -LRB- although he does say , `` every kind of a child '' -RRB- are altogether up to what we have learned to expect of the young author .

		This study is prob - ably the most important one made so far , and worthy to stand with the chapter in Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's `` Schools of To-morrow '' with which it articulates well , as a consistent exposition of the theory of education which
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	there outlines .

		Now what is the danger which this critic as well as others fails to chart properly ?

		On page 26 we read : `` The Wirt school contemplates bringing all the cultural resources of the community to bear on the school .

		It makes the school the proper and natural depository for whatever the community has to offer in artistic interest or intellectual resource '' ; on page 139 : `` There are strictly speaking , no ` extra-curricular activities ' in the Gary schools .

		The curriculum deliberately pro-
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 vides for all wholesome activities , and the student interests grow out of it '' ; on page 108 : u ... it is hoped to be able to send students from the local schools at the age of eighteen so prepared that they may complete the ordinary college course in two years . ''

		Is there not something naive in the simple trust that a young man of sixteen will find much stimulus in continuing to go for daily recita - tion two years longer to a building he has been infesting since he was six -LRB- perhaps four -RRB- , where all his activities are planned by the providential superintendent , and from which he will be sent at eighteen , a lamb to the slaughter , to consort with college juniors ?

		A very fine system it is for children , but it is surely a rash friend that claims for it advantages equal to or compensating for the mental stimulus that a student of freshman age requires .

		Moreover , when the school furnishes every intellectual and artistic interest even up to the age of sixteen , it is likely to produce some - thing deadly dull and machine-like .

		There is a valuable appendix containing tables showing dis - tribution of expenditures in the Gary schools , and reports made by Superintendent
Wirt	PERSON	on the reor - ganization of the
New York	LOCATION	schools upon his theories , a project which is now successfully under The problem of preparedness has A sane plea for , , , , r .

		been brought home to Americans in a new and forcible manner during the past two months .

		With our friends literally torn from our midst , at untold sacrifice of profes - sional and business interests , we are forced to won - der what the situation might have been had the Mexican crisis culminated in war .

		The problem of national preparedness is not a sectional nor a class problem , but one confronting every man or woman who lays claim to American citizenship .

		Nowhere have we found a more sane and dispas - sionate plea for preparedness than in
General Leonard Wood	ORGANIZATION	's book `` Our Military History : Its Facts and Fallacies . ''

		-LRB-
Reilly & Britton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		In discussing our present scheme of defense under the present volunteer system , he says : `` We have no right to employ the services of loyal and will - ing men under a system which ensures the maxi - mum loss of life and the minimum of success , a system which has been condemned by military experts the world over , including our own . ''

		Con - tinuing , he makes a survey of our military history since the War of the Revolution , writing with that scientific clarity and disinterestedness which char - acterizes the true military critic .

		It is nothing less than a duty which every honest citizen owes to his country to become familiar with that history , with its terrible blunders , its sacrifice of brave life , resulting from lack of military efficiency .

		In clos - ing ,
General Wood	ORGANIZATION	says : `` Every good American honors the real volunteer spirit , but it is difficult to understand how any man who is familiar with our country 's history can advocate the continuance of the volunteer system , with its uncertainties , unpreparedness , and lack of equality of service .

		The lack of training , the cost , the confusion all have served to demonstrate the danger of the pro- cedure ; the danger to us has been greatly increased by the force of modern organization and the rapidity with which armies can be transported over land and sea to deliver attacks on foes . ''

		One of the most interesting points which the author makes in favor of universal military service , and which will be borne out by every one who has served either in the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	or in the military training camps at
Plattsburg	LOCATION	, is that : `` the training which men get in the army , the knowledge of sanitation , the respect for law and authority , and the habits of discipline , are of inestimable value in building up a sane and sound people . ''

Miss Mackenzie	PERSON	was engaged as a member of the
West Africa Mission	LOCATION	in ministering to the heathen of the

		In one of her letters she says : `` I do n't see how I can make you feel the thrilling quality of the work here .

		We of the

		The names by which this young shepherdess was called by her `` black sheep '' are sometimes amusing .

		Forbidden to call her `` Mamma , '' the common form of address in such cases , they contented themselves as best they could with substitutes like `` Matchenzie , '' `` Tchensie , '' and `` Mr.

		In an early letter the writer describes the strange beauty of the Kamerun people , `` a beauty of body and of pos - ture , of color and of draping .

Greece	LOCATION	: naturally ,
Thales	ORGANIZATION	formed his first philosophy on strongly sympathetic grounds .

		After all , what was the difference between man and animal ?

		Were they not both beloved by the gods ?

		Did not the gods alike enter their forms ?

		Man had two natures , and both had equal rights , the sensuous and the intellectual : from them combined the spiritual was formed , or rather exhaled as the sweet breath of a lovely poetry .

		These modern poems are truly very ancient : so near can art bring Past and Present .

		`` Down the shadowed forest glade the nymph flashes like a silver arrow from a bow .

		Her golden hair streams out like a flying veil ; her eyes are bright with terror ; her crimson , sob - bing lips are salt with tears .

		`` Behind her , a dark shadow darting nimbly over the silent earth , a satyr speeds , his cheeks all flushed with red , his clutching hands stretched out . '

		Ho , ho , ho ! '

		chuckles an old man , lean - ing upon a staff .

		` Ho , ho , ho !

		Why dost thou run ?

		Thou wilt be caught !

		Thou will be caught ! ' ''

		Some of these pieces have a little too much activity of the physical existence in them , but still they are the very Sicilian vases before the eye .

		Labor and Law , There is hardly any subject which makes heavier demands upon the time and thought of our legislature than labor .

		Formerly our lawmakers attempted to cover every detail in legislating on labor prob - lems , leaving it to the courts to enforce the law .

		To-day such legislation has become so voluminous in amount and highly technical in character that it has become impossible for legislatures to cover every detail .

		Instead it has been found better to mark out certain lines of action based on certain underlying principles and leave the details to administrative officers who are always on the job .

		In `` The Principles of Labor Legislation '' -LRB- Harpers -RRB- Professor Common and Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	have given us a very compact and complete sum - mary of legislation on almost every conceivable subject directly affecting labor .

		The fundamental principle of all such legislation is that it must be reasonable , `` But reasonableness in labor legisla - tion is as complicated as human life and modern industry .

		A reasonble standard in one field has no meaning in another . ''

		Health , safety , welfare , hours of labor , periods of rest , age and sex of workers , all raise a great variety of standards .

		Employer 's liability , workmen 's compensation , sickmen benefits , old age pensions , unemployment , woman and child labor , and the minimum wage are all pushing themselves to the fore , each with its own standard .

		What that standard is can be determined much more easily by an administrative body than by a legislature .

		All the subjects named and several others are dealt with in a very com - prehensive way in the book under review .

		The general -LRB- and gentle -RRB- reader interested in such subjects will find his vision broadened by its perusal .

		The student will find a mine of valuable information in it and the investigator will find many helpful guides in his work .

		A new trans - lation of
Carducci	PERSON	.

		There is actual need for a worthy translation of the poems of the great poet and prophet of the Risorgimento .

		It is , therefore , with expectation that one approaches `` The Rime Nuove of
Giosue Carducci	PERSON	'' -LRB- Badger -RRB- translated from the Italian by
Miss Laura Fullerton Gilbert	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unfortunately , that expectation is not satisfied .

		The extreme beauty of
Carducci	PERSON	's work , its serenity , and again its passionate ardor couched in plastic and still Classieism , its flow , its picturing , its constant good taste , its frequent simple sublimity , are all gone .

		In the place of a poet of the first rank in the Italian , in the English we discover hardly a poet of the second order .

		In her well-written and inter - esting introduction , the author says that `` the pur - pose of a translation is preeminently to arouse interest in the original , and if the quest of the unknown adds zest to the seeking , so much the better . ''

		But unfortunately she piques no curi - osity , nor adds a zest to the seeking .

		Indeed , a lover of
Carducci	PERSON	can hardly finish the volume .

		Someone has said that translation is a sin against the Holy Ghost , that is , a failure to believe in the unchangeable felicity and power of an original transcription of a spiritual experience , a taking of a masterpiece in vain .

		Be that so , one who attempts translation should be well aware of the sin accounted unto him : not if he fail to translate with exactitude the visible shells of poetry , but if he fail to make a new addendum to his native language , equal in beauty and ease to the father of his work , faithful in spirit and emo - tion .


Carducci	PERSON	, of many geniuses , is hardest of all among the Latin races to translinguate , by reason of the Horatian manner of his composi - tion .

		The dove-tailing of his syntax , meter , and thought , is the despair of the Moderns .

		Even the eminently scholarly
Bickersteth	PERSON	has failed in reproducing him in all but some few instances : a less eminent person might think long indeed , before entering upon an equal path with him .

		A question which one still must ask , despite the author 's introduction , is : why not translate the `` Odi Barbare '' ?

		That were a gift ; something to
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 111 make our English poets gird themselves for a new inspiration .

		May such a work come soon , but let him who undertakes it pause before he publishes .

		Padding , false sense of harmony in verse or stanza , bad taste in rhymes , will ruin it com - pletely .

		Not often has an American scholar A important produced a reference book more manual .

		.

		, , urgently needed and more thor - oughly welcome , although a comparatively small audience is concerned , than `` A Manual of the Writings in Middle English 1050-1400 , '' by
John Edwin Wells	PERSON	, professor of English in
Beloit College	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This splendid volume of 941 pages , beautifully and carefully made , betokens either extreme philanthropy on the part of the publishers , or an awakening of interest in the literature of the fascinating late English Middle Age .

		The author classifies all the English writing of the period indicated -LRB- in the case of Romance , all up to the age of printing -RRB- under main types , gives the probable date , the sources when known , the dialect in which first composed , and the generally accepted views of scholars .

		To this is added an abstract of each piece of any importance .

		The amount of work involved in this performance alone is enormous , especially as there is nothing slip-shod or perfunctory about it .

		At the end a complete bibliography is given in the order of their description , with abundant cross - references which give the work a high degree of efficiency for the student .

		The large and impor - tant section of Romances is divided according to two principles : first according to theme and origin into English and Germanic Legends , Arthurian Legends ,
Charlemagne Legends	LOCATION	,
Breton Lais	PERSON	, etc. , second according to probable Chronology and Dialect .

		This simple but exacting device will be found an inestimable boon to the student trying to gain a comprehensive survey of a certain type of romance .

		The proportion is for the most part perfect , the author playing no favorites .

		The fact that 148 pages are devoted to Chaucer merely indi - cates the more intensive cultivation by scholarship of that field .

		There is one surprising feature , and a little disappointing .

		Chapters are devoted to
Wycliffe	LOCATION	, to
Richard Rolle	PERSON	of
Hampole	LOCATION	, and to the
Pearl	LOCATION	poet ; yet one will look in vain through the table of contents for any hint of the name
William Langland	PERSON	, or even
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, though of course the
Piers Plowman	ORGANIZATION	sequence is discussed under a general type .

		However one should not be finicking ; there is so much benefit here for the student and so much of interest to the curious reader that one should forgive an unintentional slight .

		, .

		To his `` Three Oxford Movements '' TM three
Oxford	LOCATION	, v > - n it t / - IT i Reformers .

		tn e Rev.
E. Parkes Cadman	PERSON	has added `` The Three Oxford Re - formers ,
Wycliffe	PERSON	,
Wesley	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The book is a ` substantial collection of evidence and accepted opinion , together with his - torical exposition of the periods involved , written in admirable style with refreshing fullness of vocabulary .

		Of the three ,
Wycliffe	PERSON	presents most difficulty for satisfactory treatment to-day , and Dr.
Cadman	PERSON	has wisely adopted the results of recent writers .

		Wesley suffers no serious change ; but one may question whether the popular idea of
Wesley	LOCATION	, the enthusiast , should not be supple - mented by a fuller account of his labors to popu - larize knowledge , '' natural philosophy , '' and the science so congenial to the Deists of the time .

		Wesley 's `` Survey of the Wisdom of God in the Creation , or a Compendium of Natural Philoso - phy '' -LRB- 1775 -RRB- maintained its popularity , and the second American edition appeared in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1816	DATE	, in two volumes .

		The book is good read - ing to-day , the examples are chosen for their interest , and something of
Wesley	ORGANIZATION	's selective sense might well be cultivated by text-book makers .

		The consciousness of natural religion , partly inspired perhaps by such writing as that of
Addison	PERSON	's great hymns , and of the philosophical pamphlets , ' pervades the book .

		It must have appealed strongly to men only slightly concerned with doc - trines of personal conversion .

		For
Newman	PERSON	Dr.
Cadman	PERSON	shows a sympathetic understanding , at its best when describing
Newman	PERSON	's rather apathetic reception into the Roman communion .

		Browning alone could have done justice to the tragic poetry of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's later years .

		Only an Englishman , perhaps , can read between the lines of these years ; the late
Wilford Ward	ORGANIZATION	might have done that , and one may venture the opinion that no one outside the Anglican church has more successfully done so than Dr.
Cadman	PERSON	.

		The book is testimony to an informing and constructive spirit of Christianity in the writer .

		The audiences , to whom these studies were originally addressed , are to be congratulated .

		Popular exposition , of such a high level , and of so scholarly and catholic a spirit , is rare in this country .

		_ satisfactory brief history of is much needed .

		No work in English does for
France	LOCATION	what
Henderson	PERSON	's `` Short History of the German People '' does for
Germany	LOCATION	.


G. B. Adams	PERSON	' `` Growth of the French Nation '' is admirable , but is is merely a sketch .

		A new work of the compass of
J. Moreton Macdonald	ORGANIZATION	's three short volumes -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is certain , therefore , to be scanned with eager expectancy by those who wish to see the various phases of French civilization ade - quately set forth .

		To many such readers Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	's work will prove , on the whole , disap - pointing .

		They possess solid merits , it is true , and yet this makes their defects the more annoy - ing , especially in the case of the volume on the period from the outbreak of the French Revolu - tion to the end of the Franco-Prussian War .

		In the first place the author retains the traditional subdivision by reigns , and so inevitably overem - phasizes the military and political aspects of his subject .

		Such a chronological framework is rarely suited to the exposition of changes in industry , in literature , or in art .

		For example , chapter XIX bears the title of ``
Francis I.	PERSON	and the French Renaissance '' , but the distribution of space is sig - nificant , two or three paragraphs of random com - ment on the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	being followed by `` AN a ~ 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	twenty-six pages about wars and political intrigue .

		Again , the introduction of machinery , which marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , is specifically located in two , if not in three , reigns , those of
Louis XVI	PERSON	,
Napoleon	PERSON	, and
Louis Philippe	PERSON	.

		Scarcely anything is given besides a bare mention , and the uninstructed reader will be left in mental confusion about a subject the great importance of which the author expressly states .

		The author 's explanation of social conditions is much clearer and more interesting for the late Roman and mediaeval periods than for modern times .

		His treatment there is also more sym - pathetic .

		His description of the French Revolu - tion is done in the same depreciatory spirit which characterized the chapters which he contributed to the eighth volume of the
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many statements of fact must be ques - tioned .

		The assertion , for example , that after the King and the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	were transferred to
Paris	LOCATION	they `` were completely in the grip of the mob '' is grossly exaggerated .

		A little further on the author declares that the new municipal organi - zation was `` ill-advised in the moment of its adop - tion . ''

		This argues a slight acquaintance with what happened in the
summer of 1789	DATE	, when the old municipalities were overthrown by violence or changed by common consent .

		The Assembly could not restore them ; some scheme of reorgani - zation was inevitable .

		Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	calls the system vicious .


Stein	PERSON	's collaborators did not think so in
1808	DATE	, when they reorganized the Prus - sian towns .

		The fatal lack of control by the central authority was simply an incident of the existing distrust of the monarchy , and was speedily corrected under the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	by the intro - duction of prefectures .

		The author 's prejudice against the work of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	leads him to make the ludicrous statement that the law on the franchise withheld the vote from eighty - four per cent , of the population .

		As a matter of fact only three-sevenths of the men were disfran - chised .

		The remainder of the eighty-four per cent , is made up of women and children .

		It is to be feared that riot many A memoir .

		people in
America	LOCATION	will have the courage or even the curiosity to open Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's '' Gaudier-Brzeska : A Memoir '' after a glance at the cover .

		On this cover is repro - duced the photograph of a young sculptor with long hair and an unpleasant leer , in front of whom is a work entitled `` Bird Swallowing a Fish '' , executed in what is roughly -LRB- often very roughly -RRB- called the Cubist style .

		There is no use in attempt - ing to recommend this volume by concealing the fact that it is written by an extremely modern poet about an extremely modern sculptor .

		And yet to those who are not already discour - aged it may be said that the memoir has a three - fold interest .

		In the first place it presents an unusual personality and a `` romantic '' career .


Henri Gaudier	PERSON	was an eccentric and brilliant young Frenchman who lived and wandered about in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	in typical Bohemian fashion , finally settling in
London	LOCATION	.

		Here he first began sculpture and allied himself to the `` vor - ticist '' group , a number of writers , painters and sculptors whose official organ is a magazine called `` Blast . ''

		At the outbreak of the war Gaudier , who had arbitrarily added to his name | the hyphen Brzeska -LRB- pronounced Breshkah -RRB- returned to
France	LOCATION	to enlist .

		But as he had `` skipped '' his military service , he was arrested and threatened with `` ten years in
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		That night he climbed from the window of his temporary prison , escaped to
England	LOCATION	, explained his case to the
French Embassy	ORGANIZATION	, and returned with better credentials to .

		serve in the trenches , where he was killed in
June , 1915	DATE	.

		His letters from the trenches to Pound and others are the most vivid impres - sions of the war which the present reviewer has seen .

		Brzeska describes the whole thing as a `` bloody bath of idealism . ''

		With a barbaric pride which is very characteristic he takes no pains ta conceal his delight in killing .

		But he also writes of the larks and nightingales , `` The shells do not disturb the songsters ... They solemnly pro- claim man 's foolery and sacrilege of nature .

		I respect their disdain . ''

		The life of such a man is surely worth a glance , especially as it was ended at the age of twenty-three .

		Of his sculp - ture anyone may judge from the excellent repro - ductions of the plates , but not at a glance .

		The present reviewer had the opportunity of knowing the sculptor and seeing his work in the
summer of 1914	DATE	, and though he was by no means converted , he was convinced on examination that
Brzeska	PERSON	was a fine craftsman in the new style and that he often succeeded in expressing emotion by means of his `` arrangement of planes '' and `` balance of masses . ''

		There was , however , a good deal of malicious trickery in all his work .

		The third field of interest in Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's book is Mr. Pound ; his humor , his rhetoric against the
Philistine	LOCATION	, and especially the theories of art held by the `` vorticist '' group .

		Under this last heading Mr.
Pound	PERSON	assumes , not without a certain right , the mantle of
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	has gained much in sanity and in clear - ness of expression ; he is now not only amusing , he is stimulating .

		He brings out
Brzeska	ORGANIZATION	's pref - erence for the barbaric emotion of Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture as opposed to the alleged effeminicy of the Greek .

		The keynote of vorticism is the direct interpretation of feeling .

		As to sculpture this ideal is best stated by a quotation from Mr.
Binyon	PERSON	's `` Flight of the Dragon . ''

		`` It is not essential that the subject-matter should represent or be like anything in nature ; only it must be alive with a rhythmic vitality of its own . ''

		This is at least worth thinking over , and the book contains much else that is equally suggestive .

		The sublime in science .

		Poetic idealism comes to the defense of mathematics in `` The Human Worth of Rigorous Thinking : Essays and Addresses '' by Professor
Cassius J. Keyser	PERSON	-LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has a deep sense of the poetry of the eternal and the immutable and in pleasing language he suc - ceeds in conveying something of this feeling to his readers .

		Besides these chapters there are a number of excellent essays on other subjects of science .

John	PERSON	.

		`` Oh , the good companion that he is !

		But I wonder what fly has stung him .

		He does nothing but study since I do n't know when .

		As for me , I study not at all .

		We are no students , in our abbey , for fear of the mumps .

		Our late abbot was wont to say that it is a monstrous thing to see a learned monk . ''

		The practitioners of criticism in the present generation are divisible into two grand classes , the
Friar Claudes	PERSON	and the
Friar Johns	PERSON	, and a third class on whom these two waste no respect .

		The Claudes , stung into studious - ness by some malicious insect hostile to eon - vivially intellectual spirits , withdraw them - selves from friendly conversation about books and authors so that they may devote their talents with cumulative zeal to problems of influences , tendencies , decadences , reversions , efflorescences , anticipations , and whatever other intensive or extensive matters of mighty importance may be submitted to the prettily assembled machinery of inductive or deduc - tive critical processes .

		They have no leisure for the easy chair and the talkative spright - liness of `` literary letter '' or causerie .

		They have no desire to please any but a reader who wears the meticulous nose-glasses of somewhat erudite insistences .

		They like to astound him whose scholarship is palpably circumscribed .

		They can not warm to their tasks of measure - ment and assay unless they are mentally garbed in academic cap and gown or some - thing correspondingly formidable and austere .

		With utmost gravity these `` savants '' -LRB- the name by which the newspapers honor and humor them -RRB- will undertake to prove , for instance , that some short-lived philanderer with the muses in the seventeenth century -LRB- a `` third-rater , '' probably , whom to your shame you may have totally forgotten -RRB- , that this person , had his span been longer , would have experienced no greater visitations of the divine afflatus as a poet , but as a dramatist must certainly have achieved rare technical power .

		This is a favorite kind of enterprise with them , but they can be clever at other 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	sorts of critical divination and disclosure .

		They can establish a sure mark of artistic con - sanguinity between the late
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	and
Racine	LOCATION	.

		They can elaborate , `` philosophi - cally , '' the paradox that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	was essentially a classicist by very reason of his romanticism -LRB- or the other way around -RRB- .

		But that is easy .

		They could with equal dex - terity and assurance , did the notion strike them , make it apparent that
Hazlitt	PERSON	was a disciple of Heraclitus because both con - demned the common man .

		At their best they can come near being as glibly theoretical , as impudent , as downright , as complacent , as ingenious , as profound as the masters of criti - cism , without ever for a moment running the risk of being as interesting as any of these .

		There was a time when they might have been good companions , but now they are merely students .

		At their worst they are like those ancient Chinese scholars whose learning was computed by loads .

		A book in that day was so ponderous that a yoke of oxen was required to draw it , and no man could qualify as a scholar worthy of homage until he had mastered five carts .

		The
Friar Claude	PERSON	of criticism has usually mastered his five .

		How different is the way of the Friar Johns !

		They are still and forever a light - hearted -LRB- and sometimes perhaps a briskly light-headed -RRB- , irresponsible crew .

		They never know a triste hour .

		The day is hardly long enough to allow full swing to their high spirits .

		If they locked themselves up in the refrigerating cell of literary research , surely they would have the intellectual mumps .

		But as it is , they never even catch a cerebral cold , never get snuffy and ill-tempered like the Friar Claudes .

		They are characteristically boisterous and gymnastic , adept at verbal legerdemain , given to the mimicry of airs and graces , fond of shocking grown-up ladies whose cultivation is of the most elegantly lace-like quality , fond of pleasing young people who have a frank fancy for being amused at the simplicity of their elders .

		They will toss you off a coruscant column every day , or a variegated cluster of half a dozen columns once a week , or a dashing - cavalier little essay once a month , as you prefer .

		They will anatomize for you the book of the minute or an old survivor from less prolific times with a surgical spontaneity that is delightfully oblivious to the welfare of the `` case . ''

		They will discover for you a `` tre - mendous trifle '' or a variation of type with as much skill in entertainment as if they were the climactic artists in the programme at the vaudeville .

		They will dazzle you with a tum - bling and glittering cargo of `` Ivory , Apes and Peacocks '' until your mind is set spin - ning like a Christmas top .

		They will give you as swift a ride about the literary world as if they had you on something like one of those contrivances for testing the nerves and the breathing apparatus at a
summer	DATE	park .

		You leap and fly and plunge from music to drama , to novel , to poetry , from
Russia	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	and from
Ireland	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It is amaz - ing , how many names and titles and phrases these quick-witted monologuists , magicians , and ventriloquists of criticism have at their tongue 's tip all the time .

		Knowledge is theirs in inexhaustible plenty , but it would be mon - strous if they were `` learned . ''

		Never is there any suggestion of the lamp , of the long session , in studious solitude , with the multitudinous page .

		Look for no pallor in their cheeks .

		Theirs is always a ruddy hue .

		The third class of critics , scorned alike by the
Claudes	PERSON	and the
Johns	PERSON	, is comprised of those polite and kindly writers who , from their comfortable cushions , in their beauti - fully appointed studies , surrounded by abun - dant but not vulgarly numerous rows of eminently distinguished volumes , are the `` interpreters '' of literature to `` the people . ''

		They are very fluent and - graceful , these well - groomed writers , with their finely manicured style .

		Any trimly `` cultured '' person among their many thousands of devotees will testify that they have charm .

		What is more signifi - cant , they are commonly described as being very `` helpful . ''

		They are fertile in `` Fireside Talks , '' in `` Half-Hours with the Poets , '' and in those stimulating revelations that are most fitly gathered under the strangely surprising head of `` Literature and Life . ''

		The world of woman is especially dear to these excellently gentlemanly benefactors of the reading public .

		Their essays and chap - ters are particularly suitable for reading aloud , are wealthy and readily accessible mines of fortifying quotation , and provide perfect models for papers to be delivered before women 's clubs .

		The copies of the books by these `` interpreters '' in public libraries -LRB- and , to the impotent disgust of professors , in college libraries also -RRB- are always well
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 125 thumbed and smutched , and liberally decor - ated with marginal pencillings .

		The pub - lishers ' notices always assure you that the new books by these favorites , `` now ready , '' are full of that - ` fine flavor , '' that `` keen appreciation , '' that `` subtle sense of values , '' and that `` spiritual insight '' for which `` all true lovers of literature '' are perpetually athirst .

		Besides , these attractively wrapped packages of inspiration are frequently illus - trated with photographs of authors , their homes , their wives , their horses , their work - tables , etc. , which can not but bring us nearer to the heart of the personality behind a book .

		The interpretative writer of this neat and `` uplifting '' criticism is a philanthropist , a patron who graciously gives of his store that all may be enriched .

		And his books are inval - uable as gifts when the holidays tax our wits again or on the occasion of birthdays and commencements .

		But
Friar Claude	PERSON	will curl his lip , and Friar
John	PERSON	will throw a caustic jibe .

		Undoubtedly there is room in the world for different kinds of criticism , perhaps as many different kinds as there are varieties of litera - ture .

		If , in spite of all the combustions that keep setting parts of the world on fire , we are willing to admit that we live in a humanitar - ian age , when even the incarcerated felon is !

		beloved by conductors of correspondence courses and when a large fraction of civilized mankind is somewhat scientifically busied about educating the other fraction in every - j thing from the care of babies to folk dancing , then we ought to be willing to allow enough range of appeal in criticism to admit all classes of readers to a share in its , benefits .

		Every once in a while some jealous cherisher of high ideals in taste protests against the encouragement that contemporary publication gives to mediocrity , and reaffirms the especial privileges as mentors that belong to the cultivated classes .

		Just recently a con - tributor to one of our most unbending maga - zines declared that the established classics of literature , being essentially aristocratic , would prove to be the most potent corrective of those two primary weaknesses in democracy , lack of perspective and lack of discrimination , which doom the democratic experiment to per - manent failure .

		But the literary aristocrats , however right , would seem to be a rather tiny minority , and there is reason to believe that a vast number of respectably intelligent and unassuming people are willing to receive instruction in what constitutes the difference between the true and the meretricious , the strong and the weak , the longevous and the ephemeral , both in the books that we have long had about and in those that shower daily on our heads , and yet hold themselves suspiciously aloof from the instructors of the highest breeding .

		If this view be taken , then in all justice we should endeavor to encourage a type of criticism which , general in its address , but without loss of dignity , will min - ister to the wants of the entirely estimable reader who carries the handicap of ordinary limitations in intellectual and imaginative capacity , of ordinary poverty in knowledge of literary history and critical opinion .

		Such a criticism seems likely to be a bundle of compromises .

		It will have something of Friar
Claude	PERSON	's studiousness , something of Friar
John	PERSON	's jauntiness , something of the `` uplifting interpreter 's '' talkative kindliness .

		But it will be superior to all three .

		The vir - tual but untitular `` doctor of letters '' who ventures upon practising the profession cre - ated by this ideal must be the possessor of a marvellous tact .

		The moment that his thought becomes oversubtle , or that his air is the least bit patronizing , the moment that he appears unwarrantably to relish his own cleverness or to parade his learning , he fails of his proper effect and falls into one or another of the classes that we have indicated .

		He must believe that superficial clarity is better than profound obscurity , and yet not be afraid of taxing for all it is worth the intel - ligence of whomever he addresses .

		He must expect to be sometimes disappointing to the reader whose culture has mounted several degrees above that of the man whose pro- pensity for books is countered by natural inhibitions in the way of enjoying and mas - tering them .

		He must expect to be some - times unperspicuous to the one whose culture lies several degrees below .

		Yet he must try to render impressions and judgments that will deserve the attention of the first and will be interestingly provocative of thinking to the second .

		He must have the salt of humor and the sugar of winning phrase .

		The essential simplicity of the pretentiously scholarly critic , or of the entertainer , or of the `` uplifter , '' can not be his .

		Complex must be his method , his aim , his mode of speech .

		He must be honorable in his dealings with books 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	and authors , and with his heterogeneous readers .

		Yet he must be wily , too , in the ordering of his opinions , in his application of touchstones , in his choice of allusion , com - parison , quotation , in his suggestion of coigns of vantage from which a work may be best regarded .

		In the world of criticism he must correspond to the ideal representative of the people in the legislature or the judiciary of a democratic state .

		He must be wiser than his constituents , quicker than they to see how the wind blows , more competent to detect fallacy and sham , more powerful in the accrediting of what has merit and perma - nence .

		At the same time he must be of them , not superior to them .

		He must be their voice , yet his own voice must be clearer and stronger than theirs .

		His perceptions must be an enriched sublimation of common sense .

		This paragon must have both the pride and the modesty to know himself as a respectably benevolent institution for the diffusion of good literary judgment .

		He is a missionary of crit - ical curiosity , scrupulousness , and wisdom to the general , but he should also be readable to the elect .

		He should arm every man so that he may protect himself from both the open and the insinuating attacks on his intel - ligence by the subsidized reviewers , the pub - lishers ' advocates , and all the other workers of confusion wherever there ought to be dis - crimination .

		Expert competition has made the advertising page that exhibits the new wares something of a work of art , correspond - ing to the Japanese trick of ikebana or flower arrangement which a recent sceptical exposi - tor has described as `` a conglomeration of science , ignorance , art , etiquette , and amuse - ment . ''

		The honest and beneficent critic whose outline we are trying to draw should be an offset to the cunning exorbitance of the advertiser .

		Perhaps that is his prime func - tion .

		If so , then his secondary one should be constantly to urge the ethical and aesthetic good , as well as the sheer pleasurableness , to be won by a return to those dead who were able to write `` modern '' books before we hap - pened to be born .

		Just to-day a critic of this order reminded us that `` courage in facing and veracity in reporting the facts of life are no more characteristic of
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	than of
John	ORGANIZATION	,
Bunyan	PERSON	. ''

		And we should certainly be less foolish children if we had the wit to conceive that a rereading of
Robert Browning	PERSON	's dramatic lyrics , for example , might be after all a better time - filler than an excited gulping of the latest `` imagists . ''

		`` The highest criticism , '' observed
Emerson	PERSON	in his Journal , `` should be written in poetry . ''

		This may be taken as meaning , for one thing , that all good criticism should have style .

		Now the defenders of efficiency as a comprehensive ideal maintain that , like logic , it is merely a means to an end , that it is simply the shortest distance between two points .

		But in any kind of writing that belongs to literature , whether as a proper member or as a retainer , efficiency , so far as the medium of expression is concerned , is not the shortest distance between two points .

		There is a kind of crit - icism , researchful and speculative , to which a direct and undilated style , though rare enough , is surely the most valuable instru - ment .

		The self-regaling kind of criticism that frisks and flourishes is marked by a style in which all liberties are permitted , all sorts of electrical devices for the agitation and delec - tation of the mind .

		The decorous and soft - tongued style of the `` uplifters '' is guilty of no extravagances beyond that of fluent plati - tude .

		Each of these several styles is rela - tively homogeneous .

		But that exercised by our fourth kind of critic , with his tactful com - promise , must be variable and complex .

		It must allow for surprise and epigram , for ven - turous generalization , for the pushing of fig - ure as far as it will go , for the sharp thrust or the bludgeoning blow of irony or ridicule , for the sober tone of stern moral protest or exhortation , and for utmost literal precision of phrase wherever definition or statement of fact or principle is required .

		Ideally it calls for a versatility , a daring , and a restraint that only a talent extraordinary to the point of approaching genius can entirely command .

		Our critic who achieves the broadly benefi - cent compromise must hold , also , to a positive and yet flexible doctrine in his judgments , a doctrine both hospitable to the varieties of literary endeavor and severe in its tests of what entitles any work to the place of merit .

		In one of his lectures ,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	once quoted Baudelaire as follows : '' The immoder - ate taste for beauty and art leads men into monstrous excesses .

		In minds imbued with a frantic greed for the beautiful , all the bal - ances of truth and justice disappear .

		There is a lust , a disease of the art faculties , which eats up the moral like a cancer . ''

		These sen -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 tences are somewhat violent , and are appli - cable to not a great deal of the writing that belongs to our own time .

		But they are signifi - cant for us because underlain by a sound phi - losophy -LRB- hardly to be looked for in such quar - ters -RRB- , correspondent to that which Brunetiere was careful to show had come to be the moti - vating force in the later criticism of
Taine	LOCATION	.

		Add to the excesses of an `` immoderate taste for beauty and art '' those .

		of an immoderate devotion to the naturalistic reporting of `` facts of experience '' ; add to the `` frantic greed for the beautiful '' the frantic zest for the noisy , the savage , the mysterious , the funny , the sentimental , the economic , the crass .

		The right philosophy of criticism , recognizing dis - tortion , incompetence , and misconception in their multiple manifestations , and knowing divers ways of exposing them , will adapt its various means to its general end of correc - tion , so that first , it may be understood , and second , it may be felt .

		Friar
Claude	PERSON	and
Friar John	ORGANIZATION	will still prosper , no doubt , and also their gentle brother .

		But the critic who effects the happy compromise of useful quali - ties to be found in all three , and escapes the particular foibles of each , will be the more admirable member of society unless , as is not unlikely , he turn out to be an illusion !


GEORGE R. AtAcMiNN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-


M. Jouve	PERSON	, the French poet , said to me recently : `` We have confidence in
America	LOCATION	at the moment when the life of
Europe	LOCATION	is so profoundly menaced . ''

		The same spirit pervades the reply of the five hundred French intellectuals to the address of the five hun - dred American intellectuals .

		This reply was drawn up under the auspices of the
Paris Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	, which reminds me of an earlier and somewhat similar message from this same body but sent in this case to a single American .

		I refer to the very long cablegram received early last
spring	DATE	by ex-President
Eliot of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, `` a message of appreciation and gratitude , '' he writes me , `` based on the publication in
France	LOCATION	of quo - tations from my letters about the war printed in the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, and particularly from the letter printed in the
Sunday	DATE	Times of
March 12	DATE	.


1916	DATE	. ''

		In the letter just quoted , which was a reply to one from me in which I asked Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	if he was disposed to make public the text of the cablegram , he further says : I have thus far kept the despatch from President
Lecomte	PERSON	concealed in my files , because I thought its publication might make a bad impression on the American public , which has greatly admired the stoical restraint and reticence of the French people during their heroic struggle against the German armies .

		I have consulted some friends who know
France	LOCATION	well and have the French cause very much at heart .

		To them I have shown the cablegram .

		Their opinion is the same as my own .

		Since receiving this letter , I have seen the original text of the cablegram in question and I also agree with President
Eliot	PERSON	that its tenor is undiplomatic ; it is too severe and shows too imperfect a knowledge of the con - dition of things in the
United States	LOCATION	to be | made public on the American side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		But in extenuation it should be remembered that this telegram was composed in the midst of the terrible and then uncertain attack on
Verdun	LOCATION	and at
Paris	LOCATION	with the Germans only seventy or eighty miles away , and signed by a father ,
M. Georges Lecomte	PERSON	, whose son , I believe his only son , had recently been killed at the front .

		Professor
Maurice Masson	PERSON	, a rising scholar of
France	LOCATION	, also fell at about the same time as the son of President
Lecomte	PERSON	.

		But just before the war broke out , he had completed an extensive work on
Rousseau	PERSON	which he pre - sented to the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	as a thesis for the doctor 's degree .

		The day was fixed for this learned second lieutenant to run down to
Paris	LOCATION	in order to defend his thesis , and the necessary leave of absence had been obtained , when , shortly before the time arrived , he was killed at the front .

		However , on the appointed date , the professors , attired in their academic gowns , with Dean
Alfred Croiset	PERSON	at their head , met and took their seats at the long table , each with a copy of the thesis before him , while at the end of the table stood the empty chair of the heroic candidate .

		Then it was moved that he be given the doctor 's degree and the award , which was made unani - mous , aroused the deepest feeling on the part of professors and on-lookers .

		A few weeks later this decision of the Sorbonne was approved by the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, which , con - tinuing the delicate custom established since the war of conferring its literary prizes on the young men of letters fallen in defence of their country , bestowed the Grand Prize of Liter - ature on Professor
Maurice Masson	PERSON	.

		This sad episode brings out in a striking way the present disposition in
France	LOCATION	, men - tioned in the letter of President
Eliot	PERSON	quoted I above , to suffer in silence .

		Thus , at the begin - 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	ning of Professor
Masson	PERSON	's thesis , `` La Religion de Jean -
Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	. ''

		a superb volume of some 450 pages , are an `` Avant - Propos , '' a `` Post-Scriptum , '' and a `` Note Preliminaire , '' and at the end of the volume is an `` Addendum '' ; but in none of these is there anything to indicate that the author was killed in battle on
April 16 last	DATE	, though in the post-scriptum he seems to have had a premonition of his tragic end , for he refers to `` the hypothetical leisure of a peace which I may never know . ''

		On the contrary , every thing appears to have been done to lead the reader to suppose that the soldier-professor is among the living .

		Thus , on the title-page , after his name , he is declared to be `` Professor of French Literature at
the University of Freiburg	ORGANIZATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, '' where , by the way , he had risen to be the dean of the faculty of letters ; and in the long bibliography at the end of the volume , the last title given is that of a book by him on Chateaubriand , which `` is to appear . ''

		The only thing that could awaken suspicion as to the real situ - ation was the visiting card of
Madame Maurice Masson	ORGANIZATION	, with its deep border of black , which accompanied the sending of the thesis .

		These same remarks hold true of the three - volume edition of the thesis issued for the public -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 fr .

		50 each -RRB- .

		In fact , the supposition that Professor
Masson	PERSON	is still alive is further increased by this edi - tion because facing the title-page in each volume is a list of his works , and the last one , `` Lamartine , '' is stated to be `` in prep - aration . ''

		Perhaps before quitting the subject of
Rousseau	LOCATION	, I should call attention to a rather curious little `` find '' made by
M. Julien Tiersot	PERSON	, the French composer and librarian of the
Paris Conservatory	ORGANIZATION	, consisting of an unedited musical composition of
Rousseau	PERSON	, and report that in this connection
M. Tiersot	PERSON	has re-expressed to me his pleasant recollec - tions of
America	LOCATION	, where he lectured some ten years ago on musical subjects before several of our universities and colleges .

		He then received `` an ineffaceable impression of the lakes and cascades of the
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	region and of the sympathetic and attentive listeners of
Wells College	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But , to return to the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, the first example of the presentation there of a posthu - mous thesis was that of the artillery lieuten - ant ,
Jean Daniel	PERSON	, killed at the battle of Champagne , on
September 24 , 1915	DATE	, two days after he had finished correcting the final proofs of what , I am told , was an important work on vegetable anatomy and biology for the doctorate of sciences .

		The unfortunate candidate was the son of Professor
Lucien Daniel	PERSON	of
Rennes University	ORGANIZATION	, and the jury , presided over by the well known botanist , Professor
Gaston Bonnier	PERSON	, awarded him the degree `` with highest honors , '' on
December 18 last	DATE	.

		Still another young French scholar was lost on the firing-line ,
September , 1914	DATE	.

		`` Son - nets a Laure '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: L'Art du livre , 20 rue de Conde -RRB- , edited by
M. Landry	PERSON	, whose real name was
Lebegue	PERSON	, son of Professor
Henri Lebegue	PERSON	, one of the Sorbonne philologists , was the last book of this cultured youth , of whom the afflicted father thus speaks in a recent letter : In less than six months my son edited four works , including ones by
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	and
Eonsard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was more interested in the artistic than the philolog - ical side of his studies , but if he had lived longer , I would have advised him to use more authentic texts than those he did use .

		Abbe
Jean Welter	PERSON	, a highly cultivated graduate of the
Paris	LOCATION	College of the
Social Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, who has been in the trenches since the beginning of the war , has been more for - tunate than the scholars just mentioned .

		In a letter written last month from the
Verdun	LOCATION	front , he says : I went to
Paris	LOCATION	on
May 27th	DATE	, and defended my thesis at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		I had the best of luck .

		The professors awarded me a cum laude .

		And then I came back to the struggle here on the
Meuse	LOCATION	.

		So far Divine Providence seems to have watched over me in this combat and I trust it will be so to the end .

		I dare not try to tell you of the fight we have been keeping up here since
February 21st	DATE	.

		It sur - passes all that the mind can imagine .

		But the tide of defeat is turning against the violators of the sacred laws of humanity .

		We soldiers know that the gen - erous sympathies of your fellow countrymen have ever been with us .

		I trust that the war is now nearing its end and that
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	will again form a part of the French nation .

		And he signs his name , not
Jean Welter	PERSON	, which looks too Teutonic and might endanger his life , but
Jean Gauthier	PERSON	, and adds , `` For military reasons I have changed my name until the end of the war . ''

		Abbe Welter 's thesis was an annotated edi - tion of `` Speculum Laicorum , '' a collection of pious anecdotes compiled in
Great Britain	LOCATION	at the
end of the thirteenth century	DATE	, a learned review of which work by Professor
T. F. Crane	PERSON	may be found in `` The Romanic Review '' for
April	DATE	-
June , 1915	DATE	.

		By the way , I can not let pass this occasion to show that scholarship , so apt to be denied to our country , is often flatteringly recognized by Europeans .

		Thus , in a previous letter , Abbe Welter wrote to Professor
Crane	PERSON	, who , as you know , stands high as a folk-lorist on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	:
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 129 After Professor
Charles V. Langlois	PERSON	, my teacher at the Sorbonne , now director of the
National Archives	ORGANIZATION	, I regard you as my master .

		So please accept the expression of the gratitude which a pupil should feel for his venerated master .

		After what has just been said , it is no wonder that Professor
Andre Lalande	PERSON	, also of the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, should write to the
July	DATE	`` Philosophical Review '' that on account of the dearth of professors , killed or at the front , French women holding a philosophical degree have been put in charge of classes of college boys almost old enough to be called to the colors ; which reminds me of another notable advance which woman has made recently in the French field of university instruction , where Mile .


Jeanne Duportal	PERSON	, the first woman in
France	LOCATION	to receive the degree of doctor of letters , is also the first woman to lecture before the faculty of letters at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		Pro- fessor
Duportal	ORGANIZATION	makes a speciality of art subjects and her last course was on the history of French engraving , `` which I hope to con - tinue next year , '' she said to me not long ago .

		In connection with this whole subject of the French universities in the present crisis , let me call attention to two excellent articles in the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' of
July 15	DATE	and
August 1	DATE	, `` L'Universite de
France	LOCATION	et la Guerre , '' by
M. Raymond Thamin	PERSON	.

		A conversation which I have had with
M. Yves Guyot	PERSON	also touches on some of these same university questions brought to the fore by the war .


M. Guyot	PERSON	is the well known polit - ical economist and politician , and he always holds decided and original views on every thing he speaks about .

		Here is what he said : Yes , there will be considerable difficulty in finding our future college professors when the peace comes , if for no other reason than that some 130 pupils of the great feeder of our faculties , the
Paris Superior Normal School	ORGANIZATION	, have already perished at the front .

		Then too there will be a great increase in French patriotism and , I am happy to say , a consequent loss of German university prestige among a large number of our professors who were more or less affected by the disease .

		I hope now we will get rid , in our intel - lectual work , of German style and German ways , heavy theses , an accumulation of trivial facts , use - less bibliographies , a lot of artificial means which these Teutons gave out to be real learning , but which were in truth only mechanical devices .

		Then again , also through Germanic influence , economic science as taught in our great
Paris	LOCATION	law school had been turned from the right path by Cauwes , who , without knowing any thing about the subject , accepted the first chair created there on that matter , about
1880	DATE	, and who thereupon began doling out to his students Schmoller and
Adolf Wagner	PERSON	from over the
Ehine	LOCATION	.

		But
Girard	PERSON	and
Briere	PERSON	, the
Paris	LOCATION	publishers , brought out a French edition of these men 's works , and when we could get a somewhat clear idea of what they were saying , all their prestige quickly faded away .

		The law school began to break away from these teachings about
1895	DATE	and the war , I think , will completely emancipate it .

		I hope also the war will put an end to another Teutonic importation , if I am not mis - taken , our university system of competitive exam - inations which make Chinese of us all .

		Largely on account of this same anti-Teu - tonic feeling , the centennial of the birth of Count de
Gobineau	PERSON	did not pass entirely unno - ticed at
Paris	LOCATION	this
summer	DATE	.

		His biographer and expounder ,
Baron Ernest Seilliere	PERSON	, has been showing in a series of able articles that , contrary to the opinion of some of his country - men ,
Gobineau	PERSON	must not be regarded as one of the protagonists of Pan-Germanism , not - withstanding his having been taken over long ago , bag and baggage , by the Teutons ; and
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	in `` Le Temps '' shows that he shares the view of
Baron Seilliere	PERSON	, and then adds : ''
Gobineau	PERSON	was in reality a Merimee or a
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, and at least the equal of the first if not wholly the equal of the second . ''

		Perhaps this is the moment to call attention to the rather interesting fact that one of the very earliest appreciators of
Gobineau	PERSON	was the late Dr.
Charles D. Meigs	PERSON	, the distinguished
Philadelphia	LOCATION	physician and surgeon , who in the sixties translated one of
Gobineau	ORGANIZATION	's novels , for this rather vaporous and very versatile author wrote history that was fiction and fic - tion that was history , his enemies used to say .

		In the introduction to this novel , Dr.
Meigs	PERSON	offers a eulogistic estimate of Gobineau that would warm the cockles of the heart of the whole tribe of German extremists , and when he sent the delighted count , then a prophet wholly without honor at home , a copy of this novel , he slipped into it a photograph of himself on the back of which he wrote : i `` With the most sincere expression of perfect admiration and true affection , with gratitude for the best teacher I ever had in the world . ''

		This volume and photograph are still cher - ished by one of the daughters of Gobineau and the grandson shows them with evident pleas - i ure at this moment when a certain section of the ultra-patriotic French intellectuals cast out their progenitor as little else than a `` Boche '' ; and the living descendants of Dr.
Meigs	PERSON	also take a just pride in the perspicac -
1	DATE	ity of their father and grandfather in singling out for veneration a writer who , then over - looked by the learned world , is to-day one of the most `` discussed '' thinkers of modern
France	LOCATION	.

		The tri-centennial of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has also received due attention in various parts of the continent .

		Perhaps the most interesting of these celebrations was that held in
Denmark	LOCATION	, because it took place at
Elsinore	LOCATION	, made famous by `` Hamlet , '' where the chief speaker was the well-known Shakespearean ; critic ,
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, who has sent me the 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	full text of his remarks , striking in many par - ticulars , from which I take this single passage : Hamlet is the guardian spirit of
Denmark	LOCATION	; much more celebrated than any
Dane	PERSON	who has ever lived , and who , though not the product of any
Dane	PERSON	, is nevertheless our strongest claim to the world 's fame .

		.

		.

		Never has a Dane been able to do for
Denmark	LOCATION	what this
Briton	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, has done for us .

		And while the
Danes	LOCATION	at home were cele - brating the memory of the great bard , a Danish publicist of
Paris	LOCATION	,
F. de Jessen	PERSON	, went a step further and , taking up a subject which has been considerably refurbished this year , declares in `` Le Temps '' that there is much ground for believing that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had actually been at
Elsinore	LOCATION	; apropos of which view he writes me :

August 25 , 1916	DATE	.

		THEODORE
STANTON	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		UNFORBIDDEN FICTION , like unforbidden fruit , lacks the charm of the forbidden .

		Already mention has been made here of the surprising apathy with which the removal of library restrictions on fiction the abolition of the one-novel rule , for instance has been received by the very persons who had before been clamoring for larger liberties in novel - reading .

		Letting down the bars to the pleas - ant pastures of romance does not result , as it might have been expected to result , in any noticeable increase in the circulation of fic - tion .

		At first a few novel-gluttons may indulge in an orgy of sensational thrillers , if the library has them , but the general average of book-circulation in this department is soon restored .

		A recent Report of the
Pratt Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute Free Library shows that a five-year average of fifty-two per cent for fiction cir - culation in that library had not been dis - turbed in the slightest by the granting of larger privileges .

		The librarian adds : '' This matter of placing fiction on equal terms with other literature as the people 's privilege , though seemingly a somewhat radical step , proved a measure of easy adoption that gave no shock to the ordering of our work .

		There has been revealed no insatiate appetite for novels that has clamored for precipitate indul - gence , but the wholesome public taste has been exhibited in the moderate percentage of fic - tion that the year 's circulation shows .

		More - over , the perplexities at the charging desk have been reduced by no longer requiring a strict differentiation in the books brought for stamping .

		The always irritating question - ing of the individual 's choice of books has been abolished , and , still better , the various subterfuges which the public everywhere devise with surprising ingenuity in order to evade restrictions , need less be brought to bear upon our patience and credulity . ''

		LORD REDESDALE , like many another writer before him , was at his best when relating his personal experiences .

		His recent death at the ripe age of seventy-nine brings again to pub - lic notice those engaging volumes in which he has told of his social and diplomatic and literary activities , and of the many friends whose sayings and doings contribute no little to the charm of those reminiscences .


Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford	PERSON	, first
Baron Redes	PERSON	- dale of Redesdale , was born
February 24 , 1837	DATE	; was educated at
Eton	LOCATION	and
Oxford	LOCATION	; and began his life in the wide world by enter - ing the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	at the age of twenty - one .

		He was appointed
Third Secretary of Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in
1863	DATE	long before ``
Petrograd	LOCATION	'' was dreamed of ; trans - ferred to ^
Pekin	LOCATION
two years later	DATE	, and to
Japan	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	, becoming Second Secretary of Lega - tion there in
1868	DATE	.

		Various other offices and dignities came to him , and he was decorated for his public services .

		Besides the above - named `` Memories '' he wrote `` Tales of Old
Japan	LOCATION	, '' `` The Bamboo Garden , '' `` The Attache at Peking , '' `` The Garter Mission to
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and `` A Tragedy in Stone . ''

		Always near the top in
London	LOCATION	social life , he enjoyed the close friendship of
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	, and was acquainted with other sovereigns .

		A happy ease of manner is said to have graced all his performances , whether diplomatic or political or social .

		From the many quoted passages of conversation in his autobiographic volumes conversation with countless nota - bilities of his time we quote , as not void of interest to-day , the following from
Garibaldi	PERSON	's lips : `` Is it true , is it possible it can be true , that there are in
England	LOCATION	people who are desirous to abolish the existing order of things and set up a republic in place of your mon - archy ?

		They must be fools .

		In
England	LOCATION	you have the finest form of government in the world a republic of which the president rules by the will of the people , and , being hereditary , depends on no political cry of the moment .

		There is not the continual danger of some one saying , ` Come out of that place , that I may get into it , ' and so no perpetual risk of upheavals .

		I only wish I could see
Italy	LOCATION	blessed with such a republic ; then I should be quite content . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 131 SIGNS OF THE TIMES IX THE PUBLIC LIBRARY are usually , but not always , encouraging to those interested in the advancement of learn - ing and the spread of good literature .

		It has chanced of late that some evidences have shown themselves of a certain increase of lawlessness , or carelessness , among the fre - quenters of our public libraries .

		a sort of demoralization that might seem to denote a contagious influence exerted on our local civil - ization by the war-rent , passion-torn , semi - brutalized countries of the Old World now locked in a desperate strife that pays small regard to the sanctities , much less to the amenities , of a well-ordered mode of existence .

		A library in one of our large cities has just reported , among items more pleasing to review , an increase during the past year of thefts and mutilations in the reading-room .

		One hundred periodicals have been illegally removed , and sixty-six mutilated .

		Sixty-nine books disappeared , but only one book-thief was detected ; and while the annual loss amounts to but five in ten thousand volumes , that is far beyond the recorded average for the last eighteen years .

		At the outbreak of the war dire predictions were current of the inevitable demoralizing effect , even upon peaceful countries , of so conspicuous an exhi - bition of the baser side of our common human nature , with all the unedifying current liter - ature , especially in newspaper form , that was sure to be forthcoming as one of the by-prod - ucts of the conflict .

		The apparent fulfilment , in some degree at least , of these prophecies induces increased longing for the closing of the temple of
Janus	ORGANIZATION	.

		EXHILARATION ix CATALOGUING is something the non-cataloguer finds it hard to conceive of as possible .

		Nevertheless this bibliographic game does yield its thrills and furnish its triumphs to the impassioned player .

		Imagine the proud sense of superiority felt by the learned maker of library catalogues in being able to puzzle the unlearned users thereof by entering in his author index , very correctly , ``
Wilson	PERSON	,
Thomas Woodrow	PERSON	: History of the American People '' before ``
Wilson	PERSON	, Sir
William James Erasmus	PERSON	: Student 's Book of Diseases of the Skin . ''

		The man in the street naturally expects to find ``
Wilson	PERSON	,
Woodrow	PERSON	, '' after ``
Wilson	PERSON	.

		Erasmus '' these two writers having in early life dropped the superfluous names which the painfully correct cataloguer feels bound to retain .

		Reference cards from the longer to the shorter forms are .

		however , condescendingly supplied where indulgent consideration unites with rigorous accuracy in the same cataloguer .

		Imagine , again , the delight of the young follower of the catalogu - ing profession who discovers for himself the little-known fact that the full name of the author of ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' was
Charles John Huffam Dickens	PERSON	, which he immediately substitutes for the carelessly incomplete `` Dickens ,
Charles	PERSON	, '' of the ordinary catalogue .

		Conceive if you can , still further , the proud triumph of him who should at last settle by i incontrovertible argument the long dispute | over the proper catalogue form for joint !

		authorship .

		Should one , for example , write j ``
Crowe	PERSON	,
Joseph Archer	PERSON	, and Cavalcaselle , !

		Giovanni Battista '' or ``
Crowe	PERSON	,
Joseph Archer	PERSON	.

		j and
Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle	ORGANIZATION	'' ?

		What j undiscovered genius shall win the gratitude of cataloguers yet unborn by deciding for all time this vexed question ?

		There is no lack of worlds to be conquered by the ambitious
Alexander	PERSON	of the card catalogue .

		As Mr.
J. Christian Bay	PERSON	reminded his hearers at the
A. L. A.	PERSON	conference this
summer	DATE	, cataloguing is a science still in its formative stage .

		His stirring address on `` Inspiration through Cataloguing '' will be found in the
August	DATE	`` Library Journal . ''

		Its tone , let it be added , is in a higher key than that of the present passing comment .

		THE HOPEFULNESS OF LANGUAGE-INVEN - TORS , those ingenious designers of the various forms of world-speech that have been expected , each in its day , to gather all man - kind into one linguistic fold , is something bordering upon the pathetic .

		Dr.
Zamenhof	PERSON	christened his invention `` Esperanto , '' or `` the hoper , '' having already adopted the name as his own pseudonym .

		Of course the Latin sperare , the French esperer , our own esper - ance , and so on , are seen in the root chosen for this expressive designation of the sanguine successor to
Volapiik	LOCATION	, which in its time , thirty or forty years ago , was fondly expected by its creator ,
Johann Martin Schleyer	PERSON	, to undo the confusion wrought at
Babylon	LOCATION	in the dim dawn of history ; and doubtless every other attempt to make mankind unilingual has been attended with equal confidence of success .

		So j it was , two centuries and a half ago , with Bishop
Wilkins	PERSON	's `` Essay toward a Real Char - acter and a Philosophical Language . ''

		and so also in a still greater degree with
George Edmonds	PERSON	's book , promisingly entitled , `` A Universal Alphabet , Grammar , and Language .

		Comprising a Scientific Classification of the
Radical Elements of Discourse	ORGANIZATION	, '' published in
1856	DATE	.

		It would be little short of a crime to seek wantonly to quench the spirit of any - one cherishing the high hope of promoting by 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	some linguistic device the brotherhood of man .

		Such sense of brotherhood was never more needed than to-day .

		Therefore let no discour - aging or flippant word fall from the lips of him who reads in a late number of `` World - Speech , '' the monthly advocate of `` Ro , '' pub - lished at
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, these brave words from its editor and publisher , who is also the inventor of the new language : `` Ro is grow - ing constantly and becoming easier , more euphonious and more logical .

		We sincerely think it is destined to be the language of the whole earth . ''

		A noble faith , the convinced Ro-ist will say , and a not extravagant hope ; to doubt would be disloyalty , to falter would be sin .

		HIGHER BOOK-PRICES , like higher food - prices , are the order of the day , especially in the belligerent countries ; and the worst of it is that , having once gone up , prices are very reluctant to come down again .

		Both books and beef climb with agility in the price-list , but descend as unwillingly as a boy returns to school after Labor Day .

		From
London	LOCATION	comes the news that Messrs.
Nelson	PERSON	have announced the advance of their seven-penny books to ninepence net , while their Shilling Library will become a shilling-and-threepence library .

		Probably
London	LOCATION	publishers gener - ally will follow this lead .

		The seven-penny book has always stood on a precarious foot - ing , financially , only the Nelsons , with their exceptional facilities , making it an assured success , and its increased price is likely to be permanent .

		Meanwhile the six-shilling novel becomes more firmly established than ever , all the publishers agreeing that it stands in no danger of being superseded by its cheaper rival .

		As one publisher expresses it , `` Until authors learn to live on beans and black bread , the six-shilling or five-shilling net novel is safe . ''

		In war , as on other occa - sions of extraordinary outlay , it is the helpless consumer that pays the cost .

		THE SEGREGATION OF JUVENILE READERS in our public libraries has made for the welfare of all concerned .

		Children 's rooms were scarcely known twenty-five years ago ; now they are a recognized feature of the well - equipped library .

		Even separate buildings for the young folk have recently been coming into use .

		The first of its kind in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, we believe was soon followed by a second , at
Medford	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and the adult reader is by no means disposed to view with disfavor the increasing separation between him and the inevitably unquiet juvenile element that has no legitimate place within the hushed pre - cincts of the library proper .

		Rather than suffer from the annoyance caused by such a disturbing factor , even a lover of children may forego his library privileges altogether .

		At one of the branches of the
New Haven Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as the librarian reports , `` owing to the number of children using the library it is almost certain that many adults feel crowded out . ''

		And this inference is strengthened by what has been noted at another branch in the same city , where `` it has been found that a decrease of the num - ber of children using the library has been attended by an increase in the number of adults as users . ''

		In all this there is intended no disparagement of the healthily active and noisy youngster .

		He is merely out of harmony with his environment in a resort intended primarily for his quieter elders .

		* THE BENEFICENT PLAGIARIST is he who ren - ders again what he has appropriated , with an added touch of excellence .

		When Longfellow adopted Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	's expressive phrase and gave it to us in memorable verse -LRB- `` He has singed the beard of the king of
Spain	LOCATION	'' -RRB- he did no injury to the English naval hero 's memory , but rather the reverse , and at the same time enriched our literature with a line that has long been a `` familiar quotation . ''

		When
Edward Dyer	PERSON	wrote `` My mind to me a kingdom is , '' he handed on , in improved form ,
Seneca	LOCATION	's saying , `` Mens reg - num bona possidet . ''

		When
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	assured the world that `` good wine needs no bush , '' he did us a service by reducing to epigrammatic form the longer and less con - venient maxim of Publius Syrus .

		When
Bacon	PERSON	said of wives that they are `` young men 's mistresses , companions for middle age , and old men 's nurses , '' he only neatly abbreviated what had already been expressed in more labored form by earlier writers .

		Professor Mustard , of
Haverford College	ORGANIZATION	, in his `` Clas - sical Echoes of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' collects some of the instances of that poet 's indebtedness to the Greek and Latin authors read by him in his student days .

		Plagiarisms these instances should , of course , not be called , nor will they be so called even by the poet 's detractors ; for the thought or conception of an earlier author may properly be regarded as `` his at last who says it best . ''

		Pope , himself a fre - quent borrower of other men 's ideas -LRB- and he returned the loan to the world with handsome interest -RRB- , has left us a memorable definition of true wit , `` What oft was thought , but ne'er so well expressed . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 133 BOOKS LOST TO SIGHT , but to memory dear , are not unheard of even in comparatively small private libraries .

		How much more fre - quently this temporary eclipse occurs in large public libraries , all public librarians know only too well .

		An inventory of its books just taken by the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library reveals misplacement , and hence tem - porary loss , of 556 volumes , though the shelves were re-arranged not long ago .

		Seven hundred volumes were found to have incor - rect shelf numbers another source of con - fusion and perplexity .

		Worst of all .

		the open shelves -LRB- for only a partial open-shelf sys - tem prevails at
Cambridge	LOCATION	-RRB- showed a loss , presumably due to bibliokleptomania how much less ugly a term than theft !

		of 538 volumes .

		On the other side of the account , one is glad to add , must be placed the dis - covery of twenty-six books that had been mourned as lost and had been replaced .

		The librarian , in his report of these losses and recoveries , offers a grain of comfort for the former in the assertion that where unlimited open-shelf privileges are granted the disap - pearance of books is much greater than where only such restricted freedom is allowed as at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Sadly apparent is it that not by any means in all cases can the librarian treat his public in the generous spirit of
Lowell	LOCATION	's lines : Be noble !

		and the nobleness that lies In other men , sleeping but never dead , Will rise in majesty to meet thine own .

		THE XEED OP BOOKS ON THE MEXICAN BORDER , to relieve the tedium of our boys in khaki , who of course can not fill with military drill all the time of their watchful waiting , has prompted the
Rockefeller Foundation	ORGANIZATION	to give fifteen thousand dollars for libraries for the soldiers .

		The
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	also contributes a large collection of reading matter , and the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	cooperates in this work .

		Public libraries , too , in some of the
Texas	LOCATION	cities , notably
San Antonio	LOCATION	and Mercedes , are send - ing out books to the military camps .

		Scien - tific and descriptive works of local interest are provided , but the indispensable novel , to chase dull care away , will also be supplied , especi - ally the standard and wholesome fiction always in demand with normal readers .

		Next to the essentials of bodily sustenance and com - fort , the soldiers in both hemispheres crave the wherewithal to enliven the deadly monotony of military service ; and the most unfailing instrument to this end is a good book .

		COMMUNICATION .

		IN DEFENCE OF VERS LIBBE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
August 15	DATE	appears a letter entitled `` Poetry and Other Things , '' by Mr.
H. E. Warner	PERSON	.

		In this letter , Mr.
Warner	PERSON	states that ``
Amy Lowell	PERSON	labels
Milton	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	back num - bers . ''

		This is very specific ; unfortunately I have never said any such thing .

		Great art can never be a `` back number . ''

		What must have confused Mr.
Warner	PERSON	is that I have often stated that art takes on new forms in succeeding generations , and that an artist must express himself in the form natural to him and his time .


Milton	PERSON	did not write in the forms which suited
Langland	LOCATION	;
Dante	PERSON	did not express himself in the Latin of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, Of course , poetry is a spoken art .

		Writing is a mere symbol by which thought can be reproduced to anyone cognizant of the symbol .

		It never seems to occur to Mr.
Warner	PERSON	that the lines are a part of the symbol , and quickly give the rhythm to a trained eye .

		It is true that vers litre could be written as prose ; for that matter , so could a sonnet .

		But the lines are in one , as in the other , a sure guide to the reader .

		It shows a very slight conversance with the prosodies of other times to consider metrical rhymed verse the only form proper to poetry .

		Doubtless it is this ignorance which has caused so much hysterical fear on the subject .

		That vers libre has come to stay is undoubtedly the ease .

		It has been with us for some three hundred years already .

		The choruses to
Milton	PERSON	's `` Samson Agonistes '' are in vers libre , so is much of
Dryden	PERSON	's `` Threnodia Augustalis , '' and
Blake	PERSON	wrote many of his prophetic books in the form , to say nothing of modern writers , such as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
W. E. Henley	PERSON	,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, etc. .

		A little knowledge of the history of English versification would serve as an anodyne for these agitated conservatives .

		That vers libre will abso - lutely supersede metrical verse in English poetry is , to say the least problematic .

		Art , like life , is subject to evolution ; but , also like life , it has a way of returning upon itself after a time .

		The whole Renaissance movement was merely the result of a renewed interest in , and understanding of , antiquity .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	and his ilk should take heart in the thought that possibly in a hundred years or so , poets will be rediscovering the sonnet and glorying in its practice .

		But why do people take the trouble to write pages and pages to prove that what is , is not , and more , can not possibly bef The word `` poetry '' seems to intrigue them .

		We care nothing for the word , all we are concerned with is the thing .

		And do these excited gentlemen not realize that for a form of art to rouse them to such vigorous protest can only mean that the movement it represents is instinct with vitality ?

		Still , even when roused , misquotation is hardly a fair weapon .

		* Although a voluminous
Life of Wallace	ORGANIZATION	was published ten years ago , we welcome Mr.
Merchant	PERSON	's volume as a useful summary of the labors of that great naturalist .

		It is by no means a mere abstract of the autobiogra - phy ; it not only covers the last years of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's life , subsequent to the publication of the larger work , but includes many new letters of great interest belonging to the earlier periods .

		The whole of the corre - spondence between
Darwin	PERSON	and
Wallace	PERSON	, so far as preserved , is given .

		The chapter on home life , by
Wallace	PERSON	's son and daughter , is charming .

		From every point of view , it must be said that Mr.
Marchant	PERSON	has been successful in producing a book which will remain as one of the more important and permanently val - uable biographies of scientific men .

		Our interest in
Wallace	PERSON	has much less to do with the external circumstances of his life than with the development of his ideas and the expression of his remarkable personality .

		He was a great amateur , and as such con - trasted strongly with the usual American type of naturalist , produced by the colleges .

		Those who have been brought up in the rela - tively narrow paths of scientific and academic orthodoxy may well be amazed at
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's strange and diverse opinions , or at his broad interests .

		If we hold that he would have been wiser to confine his activities to a narrower field , or if we believe that his freedom was only justified by his genius , we may yet ask ourselves whether we are not likely to err in an opposite direction .

		English nineteenth century science was dominated by a set of men who could hardly have developed as they did in any other country or period ; in certain respects the very weakness of academic and official life in scientific fields gave them their opportunity .

		To-day our young men are fed into the jaws of a machine , a splendid and beneficent machine to be sure , but still a machine , which produces types rather than individuals .

		It is unthinkable that we should do without our institutions for higher educa - tion ; the very fabric of our civilization depends upon their development .

		But , like all institutions , they have tendencies to be fought and guarded against .

		Fortunately the interplay between the different foci of scien - tific activity all over the world affords a fair guarantee against excessive rigidity of doc - *

		trine .

		It is not to be expected or feared that science will ever develop an orthodoxy com - parable to that of certain churches ; but it is possible through educational processes to influence the mind in such a manner that without any visible constraint it will move in narrow circles .

		One so trained could never do the work of a
Darwin	PERSON	or a
Wallace	LOCATION	, though he might do things which they could not .

		The relations between
Darwin	PERSON	and
Wallace	PERSON	have often been described , but now that every - thing is set forth in full we can appreciate even better than before the admirable spirit shown by both men .

		Upon the appearance of the `` Origin of Species , ''
Wallace	PERSON	wrote in
1860	DATE	to his friend
Bates	PERSON	: I know not how or to whom to express fully my admiration of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		To him it would seem flattery , to others self-praise ; but I do honestly believe that with however much patience I had worked up and experimented on the subject , I could never have approached the completeness of his book its vast accumulation of evidence , its overwhelming argu - ment , and its admirable tone and spirit .

		I really feel thankful that it has not been left to me to give the theory to the public .

		Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	has created a new science and a new philosophy , and I believe that never has such a complete illustration of a new branch of human knowledge been due to the labors and researches of a single man .

		Never have such vast masses of widely scattered and hitherto utterly dis - connected facts been combined into a system , and brought to bear upon the establishment of such a grand and new and simple philosophy !

		About fifty years later , at the jubilee meeting of the
Linnean Society	ORGANIZATION	,
Wallace	PERSON	said : I should have had no cause for complaint if the respective shares of
Darwin	PERSON	and myself in regard to the elucidation of nature 's method of organic devel - opment had been henceforth estimated as being , roughly , proportional to the time we had each bestowed upon it when it was thus first given to the world that is to say , as twenty years is to one week .

		For , he had already made it his own .

		Mr.
Marchant	PERSON	points out , and his book abundantly shows , that this modesty regard - ing his own work and desire to recognize that of others were characteristic of
Wallace	PERSON	throughout his life .

		Indeed , his tolerance of others and readiness to believe in their good intentions more than once led him into trouble , though fortunately in
Darwin	LOCATION	he found a man fully equal to himself in his generosity and sense of justice .

		As he grew older ,
Wallace	PERSON	came to what might appear paradoxical conclusions concerning human nature and society .

		It seemed to him that `` our whole system of society is rotten from top to bottom , and the social environment as a whole in relation to our possibilities and our claims is the worst that the world has ever seen '' ; while at the same time he felt that practically all human nature , given favorable conditions , was capable of good .

		So he said :
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 135 It is therefore quite possible that all the evil in the world is directly due to man , not to God , and that v when we once realize this to its full extent we shall be able not only to eliminate almost completely what we now term evil , but shall then clearly perceive that all those propensities and passions that under bad con - ditions of society inevitably lead to it , will under good conditions add to the variety and the capacities of human nature , the enjoyment of life by all , and at the same time greatly increase the possibilities of devel - opment of fiie whole race .

		These may be exaggerated statements , but they express the necessary aims of moralists , who may be permitted to show the optimism of workers in another field , who look forward to the day when the last of the infectious diseases will disappear before the attacks of medical science .

		Wallace never became converted to any definite programme of eugenics , but he believed that with the increasing education and independence of women , indirectly eugenic results would come from more intelli - gent choice in mating , defective types being eventually eliminated .

		War he regarded as barbarous and inexcusable , and among his last writings were some letters to the ``
London	LOCATION	Daily News , '' suggesting that it should be made a law of nations that flying machines should not be used to drop bombs on towns , etc. .

		The present reviewer made an attempt at the time to get one of these letters repro - duced in an American journal -LRB- `` The Out - look '' -RRB- , but without success .

		In this , as in so many other matters ,
Wallace	PERSON	was ahead of current public opinion .

		A very useful appendix gives for the first time a practically complete list of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		Mr.
Marchant	PERSON	states in the preface that the available letters and documents by or concerning
Wallace	PERSON	would fill four volumes instead of one .

		Possibly at some future date some of these materials may be published , but they will only add details to the essentially adequate and clear account which he has given us .

		THE POWERS OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE .

		* The fact that this is a presidential year makes particularly timely the publication of three volumes dealing with the powers and duties of the federal executive .

		Two of these volumes have an especial interest in being by ex-President

New York	LOCATION	:
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE .

		By
John Philip HilL	PERSON
Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Presidency '' consists of three lectures on the
Barbour-Page Foundation	ORGANIZATION	at
the University	ORGANIZATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	; while fuller than this book , and to some extent inclusive of it , is `` Our Chief Magistrate , '' which contains six
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	lectures in the series which includes President
Wilson	PERSON	's `` Constitutional Government of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	has made no attempt to give an exhaustive discussion of the Presidency ; he has spoken and written for the general reader rather than the special student .

		Both books are , to be sure , clear and accurate statements of what the President of the
United States	LOCATION	should and should not do ; but their chief value lies in the fact that Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's personal touches and excellent stories illustrative of the principles he discusses make the reader see one branch of the government as it actu - ally is and realize the not very obvious truth of what Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	told
Congress	ORGANIZATION	when he first appeared there , `` that the President of the
United States	LOCATION	is a person , and not a mere department of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, hailing Con - gress from some isolated island of jealous authority . ''

		To the practice of reading the presidential messages Mr.
Taft	PERSON	gives his cordial approval ; he believes that the chief executive should be a real leader , that there should be greater coop - eration between the President and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that the Cabinet officers should have seats in the legislature , that the merit system should be greatly extended , and that the finances of the government should be controlled by a responsible budget system .

		The discussion of these suggested reforms is particularly able and furnishes powerful arguments for read - justments in the direction of parliamentary government .

		As was to be expected , Mr.
Taft	PERSON	is emi - nently conservative and judicial .

		He is no narrow constructionist but he realizes that there is a federal constitution .

		The reader of these volumes , with their detailed considera - tion of the powers of the President to veto legislation , to make appointments , to execute the laws , to command the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, to pardon , and to exert in foreign relations an authority , the enormous extent of which recent events have for the first time made fully clear , can not fail to gain a clearer conception of the functions of the presidency , of the directions in which the office should develop , and also of his own responsibilities as a citizen partici - pating in the choice of a chief magistrate .

		Both the judicial and legislative branches of the federal government have retained their machinery practically unchanged , but far - reaching modifications have occurred in the 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	executive department since the Constitution was adopted .

		It is the purpose of Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's book to trace the creation and development of the federal executive departments which are now ten in number , the last , the Depart - ment of Labor , having been created in
1913	DATE	.

		This gradual development has been the result of the growth of the nation together with the co-incident extension of federal control to include many new functions .

		First of all , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	points out the meagre constitutional basis of the federal executive .

		The Constitution provides that the executive power shall be vested in the President , who is also given the administrative authority of appointment , if
Congress	ORGANIZATION	so provides , to such offices as may be created , and he may require written opinions from the principal officers of the departments .

		It was evidently the intention of the framers that the power of the President should be political and military rather than administrative , but there has grown up the extra-constitutional , complex system of executive departments provided for by acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		After an explanation of the legal status of each department and a general consideration of how the federal executive is organized , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	proceeds to a more detailed discussion of the departmental functions .

		These he divides into four arbitrary but sufficiently logical groups , in accordance with Preamble to the Constitution .

		The
Departments of State	ORGANIZATION	, the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, and the Interior perform the function of maintaining `` a more perfect Union '' ; the Departments of War , the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Justice	ORGANIZATION	`` insure domestic tranquility '' ; the
Departments of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	,
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, and Labor promote `` the general welfare , '' and the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	secures `` the blessings of liberty . ''

		The author concludes his book with an analysis of the part played by Presidents in extending the executive power , and a dis - cussion of probable developments in the future .

		He thinks that the creation of Secre - taries of Education and
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	in charge of Departments will be the next step , although he deprecates any increase in the size of the Cabinet .

		Contrary to Mr.
Taft	PERSON	, he thinks that `` the presence of the Cabinet in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would seriously interfere with the power of the Executive . ''

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's volume covers ground which is by no means unexplored , and it seems to the reviewer that he has missed two capital oppor - tunities to make a real contribution to political literature rather than a re-statement of the sufficiently known .

		The outstanding fact of the federal administrative power is the enor - mously increased scope of its activities , all accurately indicative of an extended federal control which is not widely known , and which is largely among the non-essential functions of the state .

		The consideration of this is very meagre .

		In the second place , it would seem proper if not necessary in any discussion of the fed - eral executive that there be included a descrip - tion of the ordinance r making powers , not only of the President , but also of his executive officers .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	has , in many instances , delegated its law-making powers , but Mr.
Hill	PERSON	-LRB- or for that matter Mr.
Taft	PERSON	-RRB- does not advert to this important , and from the standpoint of Anglo-Saxon legal traditions , revolutionary development .

		Within its limited scope , how - ever , the work is well done .

		It is doubtful whether the subject matter bears out the claim that the volume is related to the question of preparedness .


LINDSAY ROGERS	PERSON	.

		A REAL ,
AMERICAN DRAMATIST	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Not long ago I read an elaborate history of American literature which has been widely read abroad , with a consciousness that the per - spective of our literary historians must be imperfectly , nay blindly , caught .

		In the entire length and breadth of this work , there was no recognition of the existence of such an entity as `` the American drama , '' and , an even more remarkable circumstance , no ref - erence , even the most casual , to any American play .

		It is not enough to say that one can not write about a non-existent quantity ; it is not an adequate excuse to affirm that it is humil - iating to refer to the pathetically inept and crudely provincial attempts at drama put forth in this country .

		Employing European standards of valuation in criticism of the drama , I have found that few dramas pro- duced in this country are entitled to consid - eration in the larger movements of the drama in the contemporary era .

		Among the very small group of dramatists who have flowered up out of our soil must be included the name of
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	, whose versatility in technique , skill in catching the just sheen of local color , and power to cross frontiers with ease and distinction compel his considerate inclusion in future adequate histories of American lit - erature .

		There can be no doubt that the publication of the collected dramatic works of any Ameri - can dramatist , in especial of
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	, is an event of no little importance in American literary history .

		Indeed , if I were asked to * PLAYS .

Clyde Fitch	PERSON	; edited by
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	and

		In four volumes .

		Memorial Edition .


Boston	LOCATION	: Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 137 pronounce a judgment upon the present status of the drama as a branch of literature in this country , I should be forced to acknowledge that the outlook is drear and the accomplished works inconsiderable in number .

		The lack of a single published history of the American drama does not conclusively demonstrate its non-existence ; the extreme rarity and inac - cessibility of very many specimens of our American drama may well have successfully interposed a barrier to research , of very for - midable proportions .

		The real significance in the appearance of the four volumes now under review is found in the reflection that at last there has been developed in this coun - try a reading public for plays .

		How slow this movement has been in English-speaking countries , how startlingly rapid the recent changes in this respect , is evidenced by the fact that Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	details the following conversation of only ten years ago : `` On talking over the matter with a lead - ing American dramatist , I was delighted to find him one with
me %	PERCENT	in desiring that the immediate publication and circulation of plays may become an established custom among us . ''

		The primary reason for desiring this , to be sure , is not merely that the public may read theatre pieces which for one cause or another they are denied the opportunity of seeing in the theatre , but that the drama - tist may consciously strive for the creation of literature which shall stand the grilling test of print , as well as the cruder , and wholly different , test of stage production .

		I repeat , the publication of these plays , written for the theatre by
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	, is an event of real importance in the history of the American drama .

		If we go over the list of his plays , adapted from foreign sources , written in collaboration with others , or solely his own creations , we are confronted with a formidable array of some fifty-odd pieces , ranging from the dis - creditable and salacious `` Blue Mouse , '' adapted from the German , and the graciously charming `` Beau Brummel , '' written in col - laboration with the late
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, to such powerful and original works as `` The Climbers , '' `` The City , '' and `` The Truth . ''

		The restraint and good judgment displayed by the editors are well attested by the fact that the works included in the volumes under review number only twelve , in the following order : `` Beau
Brummel	PERSON	, '' `` Lover 's Lane , '' ``
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, '' ``
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	, '' `` Cap - tain Jinks of the Horse Marines , '' `` The Climbers , '' `` The Stubbornness of
Geraldine	PERSON	, '' `` The Girl with the Green Eyes , '' `` Her Own Way , '' `` The Woman in the Case , '' `` The Truth , '' and `` The City . ''

		These plays are of very uneven merit , and readily fall into three classes : historical , in the sense of being based on historical events and personages ; topical and provincial , lightly dealing with American and , in particular ,
New York	LOCATION	types and figures , at a definite period in our history : and genuine modern comedies , written in this latter day of
Hervieu	LOCATION	,
Sudennann	PERSON	, and Gals - worthy .

		It would be a task of supererogation and cruelty combined to point out the faults of
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	as a dramatist .

		No one familiar with his acted as well as his printed plays can deny that he possessed certain qualities which stamped him as a craftsman of more than ordinary excellence .

		In the superficial exter - nals of life , the trivial indicia of a period , the pastel shadings of local color , he possessed a skill that was as patent as it was shallow .

		His figures were often portraits of certain actors , or rather actresses ; the plays them - selves were not , then , original productions , but adumbrations , Fitchean projections of these players ' personalities and temperaments and idiosyncrasies .

		The man was effeminate in nature , juvenile in mentality , bird-like in a sort of empty sprightliness .

		His plays were often a delight to the American public , full of a sort of obvious , yet genuine , clever - ness of dialogue and ripost , which were ele - mentary enough to be grasped by the most ordinary type of brain ; and dripping with a brand of glucose sentimentality , cloying and immature , which is one of the most conspicu - ous marks of the emotive arrest in the development of our national character .

		Imag - ine an Ibsen or a
Hauptmann	PERSON	, at the last moment , considerately dashing off a small part , in one of his completed plays , for a dis - appointed actress , somewhat passee , who did not meet the requirements of one of the major roles for which she was cast !

		Yet that was
Fitch	PERSON	kind heart , conscienceless craftsman .

		It can not be gainsaid that
Fitch	PERSON	was a psy - chologist of subtle insight along theatrical lines , a `` master , '' in a small way , in feminine psychology .

		His `` Girl with the Green Eyes '' is a definite enlargement of our conception of the role of feminine jealousy ; `` The Truth '' is a study in the habit of lying almost equally interesting as a piece of psychological analy - sis .

		`` The City , '' gruesome as is the theme , has always impressed me as
Fitch	ORGANIZATION	's strongest claim to recognition for its genuine and graphic picture of the
New York	LOCATION	point of view , in regard to the value of money as an instrument for happiness .

		The play 's signi - ficant thesis is revealed in
George	LOCATION	's climactic speech , in which he proclaims that it was not 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	the
City	LOCATION	, but the characters of the city-mad people which assure their own downfall .

		The City merely serves as an excuse , not as a first cause , for exposing the secret rifts and hidden defects in their characters and their souls .

		When , after the great catastrophe which has involved them all , the others declare that the
City	LOCATION	alone was to blame for all their troubles , George passionately declares : No !

		You 're all wrong !

		Do n't blame the city .

		It 's not her fault !

		It 's our own !

		What the city does is to bring out what 's strongest in us .

		If at heart we 're good , the good in us will win .

		If the bad is strongest , God help us !

		Do n't blame the city .

		She gives the man his opportunity ; it is up to Mm what he makes of it !

		.

		.

		A man goes to the gates of the city and knocks !

		.

		.

		And she takes him in and there she strips him naked of all his dis - guises and all his hypocrisies , and then she says to him , `` Make good if you can , or to Hell with you . ''

		And what is in him comes out to clothe his naked - ness , and to the city he ca n't lie !

		It is gratifying to recall that
Fitch	PERSON	, by reason of his cleverness , his expert crafts - manship , his psychological insight , his flash - ing and cosmopolitan humor , and his real power in portrayal of characteristic phases of American metropolitan life , had a foreign vogue by no means inconsiderable .

		A legiti - mate reflection upon American standards of appraisal and a reductio ad absurdum of the crystallized American view of
Fitch	ORGANIZATION	's talent was the genuine foreign success of `` The Truth , '' notably in
England	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, and its conspicuous failure -LRB- commercially -RRB- in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The cosmopolitanism of the contemporary European stage is - well illustrated in the for - eign success of so melodramatic a piece as `` The Woman in the Case . ''

		It is surprising , in a way , that
Fitch	PERSON	did not win greater for - eign vogue ; for he was an avid student , `` on the ground , '' of foreign popular successes , and wasted much time , to his great financial profit , in adapting glittering foreign farces and light comedies for the American stage .

		Beyond doubt , at the time of his death ,
Fitch	PERSON	was the American dramatist with a voice of the greatest carrying power or should we say , one who could manufacture machines which had the smoothest running gear and ran furthest on the smallest supply of petrol ?

		His published plays reveal all the weaknesses of even his best efforts .

		He wrote but one `` Climbers , '' the type-drama which held the richest possibilities , scarcely realized , for his future development as a dramatist of sus - tained power and broad scope .

		With all his cleverness , he possessed one ineradicable fault : he was deficient in general ideas of sufficient importance to give to his plays the real vitality of contemporary classics .

		Daz - zled by the returns of the box-office , doped by the momentary success of superficial dramatic recreations , he basked joyously in the esteem of flattered actresses and wasted forever the precious talents which , though they could never have been mistaken for genius , might well have made secure for him beyond per - adventure a really elevated position in the earlier history of the American drama .

		ARCHIBALD
HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		AMBASSADOR , IN TRUTH .

		* Though we may often smile , with the cynic , at the shadowy part which diplomats have played in international affairs , we occasionally have an opportunity to make the acquaintance of an ambassador who has really helped two nations to a better and more cordial under - standing of each other .

		And in these days when everyone talks glibly of `` the enemy '' and `` liars '' and `` atrocities '' it is all the more refreshing to find such an ambassador writing a book that from cover to cover is full of good will .

		No American need be reminded that
M. Jusserand	PERSON	, the present French ambassa - dor , has been intimately connected with the life of the
United States	LOCATION	during a long period of years .

		Yet one is rather startled when told in concrete terms just how long the period has been : Thirteen years is a long space of time in an ambas - sador 's life ; it is not an insignificant one in the life of such a youthful nation as the
United States	LOCATION	; I have now witnessed the eleventh part of that life .

		Something like one-fourth or one-fifth of the popula - tion has been added since I began service here .

		There were forty-five States then instead of forty-eight ; the commercial intercourse with
France	LOCATION	was half of what it is now ; the tonnage of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	was less than half what it is at present ; the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal was not yet American ; the aeroplane was unknown ; the automobile practically unused .

		Among artists , thinkers , humorists , critics , scientists , shone
LaFarge	ORGANIZATION	, McKim ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	,
William James	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	,
Furness	PERSON	,
Newcomb	PERSON	,
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, who , leaving a lasting fame , have all passed away .

		This long association with American life , and a growing conviction that
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	have `` a similar goal ahead of them , and , to a great extent , similar hard problems to solve , '' led
M. Jusserand	PERSON	to prepare his illuminating volume , `` With Americans of Past and Present Days . ''

		Somewhere in one of his chapters
M. Jusserand	PERSON	speaks about a peculiar trait of the French people , namely , `` their aptitude for disinterested enthusiasm for a cherished idea . ''

		It is scarcely too much to say that the entire volume is at once an exposition and * WITH AMERICANS OP PAST AND PRESENT DAYS .

		By
J. J. Jusserand	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 139 an amplification of this theme .

		The seven papers that constitute the book , though on widely different subjects , keep reminding us in many agreeable ways that
France	LOCATION	has had a `` disinterested enthusiasm * ' for
America	LOCATION	: and the conscientious labor required in the preparation of the more important papers attests the enthusiasm of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		The first and longest paper .

		``
Rochambeau	LOCATION	and the French in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		is the most obvious contribution to the author 's theme .

		Although it is full of interesting sidelights on many aspects of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, j and would be valuable for these alone since it is based upon unpublished documents , its chief purpose is to show that the French came i to the aid of the Colonists not because they wished to humiliate
England	LOCATION	, as all American schoolboys have been told , but because the I Colonists were struggling for the very liberty j that was becoming a cherished idea in
France	LOCATION	. '

		The author reminds us that there was `` an immense aspiration '' among the French people at that time ; that the '' French masses were becoming more and more thinking masses '' ; that only six years elapsed between the end of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	and the beginning of the French ; and that a decade before the French Revolution the French people looked upon
America	LOCATION	as the place where democratic institutions might be estab - lished with the least possible difficulty .

		Fur - i thermore , he suggests that there was little j anti-English feeling either in
France	LOCATION	or among the French soldiers in
America	LOCATION	: It is often forgotten that this time was not in
France	LOCATION	a period of Anglophobia , but of
Anglomania	LOCATION	.

		Necker , so influential , and who then held the purse - strings , was an Anglophile ; so was Prince de '
Montbarey	PERSON	, minister of war ; so was that
Duke de Lauzun	ORGANIZATION	who put an end for a time to his love-affairs and came to
America	LOCATION	at the head of his famous legion .

		All that was English was admired and , when possible , imitated : manners , philosophy , sports , clothes , parliamentary institutions ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, just translated by Le Tourneur , with the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Queen as patrons of the undertaking ; but , above all , wrote Count de Segur , u we were all dreaming of the liberty , at once calm and lofty , enjoyed by the entire body of citizens of
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		Among the soldiers in
America	LOCATION	there was scarcely more evidence of hostility toward the English .

		When the battle was on , the French fought valiantly ; but they fought because the only way to establish liberty in
America	LOCATION	and carry out the experiment of self-government was by defeating
England	LOCATION	.

		`` During the intervals between military opera - tions relations were courteous , and at times amicable .

		The English gave the French news of
Europe	LOCATION	, even when the news was good for the latter , and passed to them newspapers .

		` We learned that news ' -LRB-
Necker	ORGANIZATION	's resigna - tion -RRB- , writes
Blanchard	PERSON	, ` through the English , who often sent trumpeters and passed gazettes to us . ' ''

		And although these practices did not please the Americans , they seem to have been in keeping with the official attitude of the French .

		In a paragraph on the surrender at
Yorktown	LOCATION	a paragraph that ought to be forwarded to all the warring nations of
Europe	LOCATION	before the final battle is fought we have these words : No trace of a triumphant attitude toward a van - quished enemy appeared in anything they did or said .

		Even in the surrendering , the fact remained apparent that this was not a war of hatred .

		`` The English , '' writes
Abbe Robin	PERSON	, `` laid down their arms at the place selected .

		Care was taken not to admit sight - seers , so as to diminish their humiliation . ''


Henry Lee	PERSON	-LRB- Light Horse Harry -RRB- , who was present , describes in the same spirit the march past : ~ Universal silence was observed amidst the vast concourse , and the utmost decency prevailed , exhibiting in demeanor an awful sense of the vicissitudes of human life , mingled with commiseration for the unhappy . ''

		This pro-American attitude was most effec - tively carried into practice by
Rochambeau	LOCATION	.

		Although he was fifty-five years of age and ill when he was called to
Versailles	LOCATION	in the middle of the night to `` receive the instructions of his Majesty , '' he soon forgot his inflammatory rheumatism , and put the zeal and energy of a young man into his preparation for the Amer - ican enterprise .

		When he arrived with his five thousand men he succeeded in overcom - ing the prevailing prejudices against the French , and he gave no one any ground * f or complaint against his soldiers .

		`` I can answer for the discipline of the army . ''

		he writes : `` not a man has left camp , not a cab - bage has been stolen , not a complaint has been heard . ''

		This would be astonishing enough if we were not told a little later that the apples on the trees overhanging the soldiers ' tents remained untouched !

		`` He seemed ,
Segur	PERSON	said in his memoirs , ` to have been purposely created to understand Wash - ington , and be understood by him .

		and to serve with republicans .

		A friend of order , of laws , and of liberty , his example more than his authority obliged us scrupulously to respect the rights , properties , and customs of our allies . ' '

		And when the siege of
York	LOCATION	- town was over ,
Rochambeau	LOCATION	not only invited
Cornwallis	PERSON	to dine with him .

		but learning that he stood in need of money , lent him as much as he desired .

		Later , when a building at the
College of William and Mary	ORGANIZATION	, occupied by the French as a hospital , accidentally burned .

		Rochambeau immediately paid for it .

		He cherished the good will of
America	LOCATION	.

		Noth - ing in his conduct , as it is revealed in the documents * M. Jusserand employs , suggests 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	that he and his army were in this country merely on a mission of hate .

		The second paper in the volume is a study of Major
Pierre L	PERSON	` Enfant and his work as original architect of the city of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		L ` Enfant came to
America	LOCATION	in
1777	DATE	, at the age of twenty-three .

		Fifteen years later , when it was decided to establish a federal city , he was favorably known as an artist and engineer .

		He was known also as a person of very bad temper , `` being haughty , proud , and intractable . ''

		Despite his disagreeable per - sonal characteristics , President
Washington	LOCATION	asked him to plan the new city , since he evi - dently had more of the required ability than anyone else in the country .


M. Jusserand	PERSON	has given an interesting account of the boyish enthusiasm with which L ` Enfant began his work ; the grand scale on which he conceived the city ; his superstitious fear of speculators at the time the city was about to be opened ; and the manifestations of temper that finally caused him to be dismissed .

		He has , more - over , written the pathetic chapter of L'Enf ant 's last days when he was the `` per - manent guest '' of the
Digges	PERSON	family in their house near
Washington	LOCATION	, and when his earthly possessions , consisting of two or three watches and some surveying instruments , were valued at
forty-six dollars	MONEY	.

		The story would have been unspeakably pathetic had it ended with the close of L ` Enfant 's life .

		But
M. Jusserand	PERSON	has told us of the reports of the Park Com - mission and the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	committee in
1902	DATE	, with their recommendation that L'Enf ant 's original plan of the city be carried out , and that departures already made from this plan be remedied wherever possible .

		He has told us , too , of the tardy but impressive ceremonies attendant upon the removal of L'Enf ant 's ashes from their resting place on the
Digges	PERSON	property , where their location was marked only by a tree , to the
Arlington	LOCATION	cemetery in
1909	DATE	.

		So we find that fate was not wholly heartless , after all .

		The third paper , ``
Washington	LOCATION	and the French , '' is complementary to ``
Rochambeau	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is not based upon so much unpublished evidence as the first paper , and the subject treated lacks the comparative freshness of the second ; yet it is scarcely less interesting than either of these .

		It acquaints us with
Washington	LOCATION	's early prejudices against the French , due to his Anglo-Saxon associates and probably to his reading of the `` Spectator , '' and then reveals the manner in which , after
Braddock	PERSON	's defeat , he came slowly to respect the French and to under - stand their `` disinterested enthusiasm . ''

		We learn anew of
Washington	LOCATION	's affection for
Rochambeau	LOCATION	and
Lafayette	LOCATION	, and his interest in the French Revolution ; and we gain some knowledge of his advent as an heroic char - acter on the French stage in
1791	DATE	.

		Incident - ally , we have a welcome account of the last days of Citizen Genet , whose activities had been so burdensome to
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This paper , as well as the first one , helps to disa - buse the minds of all those who are accus - tomed to look upon
Washington	LOCATION	as a marble statue .

		It is comforting to anyone who likes to think of the great as being quite human , to know that when it was learned that
DeGrasse	PERSON	was coming to the rescue with his fleet ,
Washington	LOCATION	threw himself into the arms of
Rochambeau	LOCATION	.

		Evidently this is the same
Washington	LOCATION	who , on a wager , danced for three hours with the wife of General
Greene	PERSON	without leaving the floor .

		These three essays constitute more than three-fourths of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		The other four , ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' `` The Franklin Medal , '' ''
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, '' and `` From War to Peace , '' are less impor - tant ; but they contribute to the author 's pur - pose of showing the close relation in history and in spirit that exists and should exist between
France	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The one on
Lincoln	LOCATION	, though full of deep feeling , can scarcely be as interesting to American readers as the one on
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It throws interesting light , however , on the attitude of
France	LOCATION	toward the
Union	LOCATION	during the Civil War , and it makes clear the wide and perma - nent influence that
Lincoln	LOCATION	has exerted on French life .

		One puts down the book with a new con - ception of the large part that
France	LOCATION	has played in the destiny of
America	LOCATION	, and a recon - structed notion of the motives that prompted her support of
America	LOCATION	's cause .

		One can not read the volume without the overwhelming conviction that there might have been no American independence , at least for the time , had there not been a spirit of liberty grow - ing irresistibly in
France	LOCATION	.

		And , though many are deeply indebted to
M. Jusserand	PERSON	for all that he has previously contributed to know - ledge , this new volume will undoubtedly sur - round him with a still larger circle of admirers .

		Without it , even in spite of the new revelation of French strength of char - acter that the present war has made , we might easily have gone on for generations without a just notion of what
France	LOCATION	has really contributed to the `` great American experiment . ''

		Yet in the volume there is no attempt at self-glorification , either for
France	LOCATION	or for the author .

		The book professes to be only a series of collected papers ; yet it is
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 141 representative of an admirable kind of schol - arship that belongs peculiarly to
France	LOCATION	.

		It is sound , modest , and simple .

		Much know - ledge was required to produce it , but little is required to understand it .

		In giving the volume to the public ,
M. Jusserand	PERSON	has ren - dered a service not only to
America	LOCATION	but to the cause of understanding and truth .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	and Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	come in the unarranged numbers of `` younger men '' of whom English fiction has a cheerfully prosperous number .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, and Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	are become fairly well fixed in the general mind , but people are not very sure about Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	, Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	, Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	, Mr.
W. L. George	PERSON	, Mr.
Oliver Onions	PERSON	.

		Miss
Ethel Sidgwick	PERSON	, Mr.
Somerset Maugham	PERSON	, or Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	and Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	.

		Each has a little group of admirers , but if you ask someone who knows all about Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	who Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	is , you are likely enough to meet with blank ignorance and vice versa .

		In fact it is wholly possible to say that Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	is one of the `` first six living realists '' and few could positively deny it , partly because they would not know just who the five other realists might be , and partly because they would not know what Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	had done which made him worthy of inclusion in any such vague -LRB- and curtailed -RRB- pleiad .

		Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's previous work , however , is well worth being better known than it seems to be -LRB- in
America	LOCATION	at least -RRB- , and `` These
Lyn	PERSON	- nekers '' is even better , in that it is more com - pletely definite and more obviously what its author intended .

		The three volumes about
Jacob Stahl	PERSON	had something of that large vagueness which is common in the recent bio - graphies of modern fiction , and lacked that feeling of completeness and single impression which one wants in art , but this book is more condensed and more satisfactory in that one can get a fair impression of it all at once .


Jacob Stahl	PERSON	was a type of the sensitive man of letters .

		This book is the story of a worker .


Richard Lynneker	PERSON	is rather the best of the modern figures in which recent English nov - elists have tried to present the emergence of the twentieth centurv from the smoothed-over * THESE LYNNEKERS .

		New chaos of Victorianism .


Edwin Clayhanger	PERSON	is doubtless the best in presentation , but in him - self is hardly typical of modern characteris - tics , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's Remingtons and Ponderevos are clearly nothing but rapid conjectures , Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's half-dozen rebels against the old regime are all drawn with an ironical insist - ence on their weaknesses and impossibilities .

		Of the later figures
Philip Morel	PERSON	in `` Sons and Lovers '' and
Michael Fane	PERSON	in `` Youth 's Encounter '' are the most memorable , but one of them is an artist and the other an aesthete , and it is not clear that the twentieth century is to be particularly artistic or aes - thetic .


Dickie Lynneker	PERSON	was a worker .

		He came from an old family settled down into conservative self-indulgence in a rectory just outside
Medborough	LOCATION	, a cathedral town not far from
London	LOCATION	.

		His father , his mother , his elder brothers -LRB- both clerical -RRB- , his elder maiden sister , all represent an acquiescence or a subservience in the established order in which they comfortably exist .

		His younger sister kicks over the traces and is for the time lost .

		Dickie , the youngest brother , buckles down to the different necessities and possibilities of life , and comes out at the begin - ning of the twentieth century on the sure road to be somebody .

		The family and the man are well drawn , but Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's most original achievement lies in his concep - tion .

		We are by this time very familiar with the idea of the new man or the new woman rebelling against the imbecilities of old con - vention , and insisting on `` being himself '' or herself .

		We have had plenty of accounts of how people got rid of all sorts of religious rigidities , moral interferences , social tedious - nesses , and so on .

		Losing one 's faith , one 's principles , one 's habits -LRB- everything but one 's honor , and often enough that too -RRB- , that is something we have got well accustomed to imagining , for it has been presented in the last few years with great vigor in a score of striking if slightly sketched-out forms .

		To us in
America	LOCATION	at least , that sort of thing seems rather old-fashioned and indeed con - ventional .

		With us the eighties and nineties , whatever they were , were not especially a time of the freeing of the individual from old restraints .

		With us -LRB- as with the French -RRB- , they were rather a time of positive building up of new ideals of life out of all sorts of national material which had come to easy notice after the unhappy reactions of a great war .

		With us , as with the French , the thing the present generation had to do when young men and women was not to get free of bind - ing conventionalities but to prepare itself for the many ways that offered of making life 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 7	DATE	effective .

		It is by being that kind of person that
Richard Lynneker	PERSON	seems to get into touch with the real currents of life better than any of the other figures -LRB- attractive though they be -RRB- of which current English writers , includ - ing Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	himself , have offered us so many .

		Such a conception is in itself something worth while , though not enough for greatness .

		Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	has here happily succeeded in realizing his idea in a set of figures and an atmosphere indisputably human and presum - ably true .

		As to just what may have been life in a country rectory in the eighties and nineties the average reader will have but the vaguest idea ; but Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's figures cer - tainly seem absolutely and actually real .

		It may be that if we knew better we should crit - icize a little .

		When it comes to things that I think I know about I do criticize .

		For instance ,
Adela	ORGANIZATION	after five years in
Canada	LOCATION	comes back with American habits of thought and ways of speech ; she says her brother looked `` as if he was rubbering at the freaks in a dime museum . ''

		How it may have been in
Toronto	LOCATION	I can not say , but in `` the States '' no one would ever have said that because the dime museum period was over and done with before the word `` rubbering '' came into use .

		In like manner , one of Adela 's children -LRB- who `` spoke pure American '' -RRB- `` remarked on the cuteness of the back seat of the ` wagon . '

		!

		The word `` cute '' Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	must have got from books ; few use it at present , and no one who did would apply it to the back seat of a `` wagon '' either in
Toronto	LOCATION	or anywhere else .

		So in very minor ways Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	, where he does not happen to know the life he is presenting , depends on false authorities , and it may be that he does so in larger ways .

		But the general impression is quite the con - trary ; his book on the face of it is a rich and true working out of a sound and good con - ception , and that in a form which will be likely to make a much more definite impres - sion than the larger and somewhat vaguer picture of life in the trilogy of
Jacob Stahl	PERSON	.

		It naturally lacks the variety of that fine work ; it has in it nothing quite so good as the best of it -LRB- the beginning of `` A Candidate for Truth '' -RRB- , but taken as a whole it should do more to give people a high idea of its author .

		However much Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	and Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	may be alike -LRB- their publishers call them both realists and other people have called both `` younger men '' -RRB- there is not much superficial resemblance between `` These
Lyn	PERSON	- nekers '' and `` Three Sons and a Mother , '' unless it be that both are about families .

		The former is one of the biographies not uncom - mon in fiction to-day , or perhaps autobiog - raphies or near-autobiographies .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	has written such books himself ; in fact he is rather apt to take up a person , get him out of old surroundings into new ones , and then show how life gets along de novo .

		That is always something of a biography , which may begin with birth and end with marriage , or begin anywhere else and end nowhere in par - ticular , as is apt to be the case with modern realists .

		The present book is on the face of it different ; it presents itself at least , as the story not so much of an individual as of the development of the life of a family .

		One gathers from some prefatory lines that it is a story of Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's own family , though of just what element is not very clear ; we certainly do not have Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's own youth , for he did not grow up in the days when
Victoria Eegina	PERSON	was a young woman unless his age is nearer one hundred than is likely .

		Nor would Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	be apt to present his own youth and that of his brothers in any such manner .

		However that be , the book gives a curious study of the Victorian age in its early days which is interesting reading along with Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's study of later Victorianism .

		Just why these able chroniclers of current history should betake themselves to the history of the day before yesterday and the day before that is hard to say .

		Many nowadays who are not absorbed in the moment are at least thinking of expla - nations of the moment .

		Mr.
Caiman	PERSON	is at least frankly historical .

		`` History '' wrote the maiden sister who had lived in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, `` is concerned with the absurd and rather theatrical doings of a few people . ''

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	gives us an amorphous history of e #rly Victorianism : we have the financial security , the subordination of everything to obvious success , the individual comfort and independence , the stagnant wealth and the unconsidered squalidnesses of poverty , the remoteness of religion , the theoretical free - dom and the actual tyrannies of day-to-day life , the constant talk and discussion , the usual lack of beauty , thinking , comradeship , liberty -LRB- the phrases are mostly Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's -RRB- , that we associate with the immedi - ate past .

		This view of Victorianism , however , does not come to the surface till one has got well along in the book .

		On the face of it the story is of a Scotch widow with five young children , who set out to make their fortune or fortunes in
England	LOCATION	.


Margaret Lawrie	PERSON	had brothers who had `` done well '' in Eng - land .

		First
Jamie	PERSON	the oldest boy goes down to Thrigsby , the growing North-of-England
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 143 cotton metropolis of the forties ; he gets a foothold and brings down his mother and the rest of the family , and the story concerns their life , or at least the lives of the boys , who grow up , get on in business , marry , and so on .

		Such at least is the ostensible topic of the book ; in reality
Jamie Lawrie	PERSON	is the only one with whom the reader is given any sympathy , so that the book gets round to the common theme of the man of genius amid impossible surroundings .

		At the end
Jamie	PERSON	goes to
America	LOCATION	to make certain journalistic studies ; the book ends as he leaves
England	LOCATION	with a vague longing and a passionate hope , `` going towards the
New World	LOCATION	where there had been wars of liberty . ''

		Possibly Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	medi - tates a trilogy .

		This much on the subject , however , does not really give us a sufficient idea of the book which is Victorian in its large inclusiveness and its detail .

		The publishers speak of Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	as a realist .

		Of course that word may mean almost anything , but if it gives the idea of one who presents things as they really appear to an observer of life , who gives a picture of life , then Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is not a real - ist .

		Since the time of Balzac the writers of fiction have generally worked to give us an idea of how their people and their scenes appeared to the eye , to present us with some - thing of a panorama of the world .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	throws all that overboard and deals with people almost in the spirit .

		Not that he says absolutely nothing about appearance and form , but he never carries on his account so that we are tempted to visualize it .

		Some - where or other he calls his work a `` comic vision ' and such it is ; comic in the
Meredith	PERSON	- ian sense , and vision , not because it deals with something seen but because it deals mostly with spiritualities and states of mind with only form enough to make them comprehen - sible .

		There is much more to say on this subject which must be left out here , but so much it was well to say for the sake of the reader who might easily be bewildered in the current of short statements of fact that make the book , without much idea of whither it was carrying him .

		One will have to get half through the book before beginning to appre - ciate it , at least I did .

		The End of the Century and Early
Victor	PERSON	- ianism , are both of these curious topics for our modern realists ?

		When one 's own time becomes impossible then one may well enough turn to history .

		When everything seems shifting , unstable , ephemeral , one may well enough try to be free from passing impres - sions .

		English literary taste to-day is said to be turning to `` more serious '' things .

		These two novels , at least , are more serious in inten - tion than the great mass of our American fiction , and being well done are better worth reading .

Weimar	LOCATION	.

		Her friend ,
Madame von Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, said very firmly , `` Now
Anna	PERSON	, remember that she is Imperial Highness and talk , talk , talk !!

		Do some credit to your own celebrity . ''

		It is with hope of , such `` talk '' that a reader opens the thick volume of Letters -LRB- 1812-60 -RRB- edited by Mrs.
Steuart Erskine	PERSON	, for although Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	is less of a celebrity to-day than she once was , there is still due to her admiration and respect for her service as critic of art and literature .

		Much of her work has been relegated to the limbo where go the senti - mental and the ultra - Victorian , yet `` Sacred and Legendary Art '' is still useful , and still marks an epoch in which women entered brilliantly into the fields of criticism , poetry , and fiction .

		The daugh - ter of an impecunious Irish miniature painter , the wife of an English barrister from whom she speed - ily separated because of complete incompatibility , Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	labored unceasingly that she might help support her mother and her sisters as well as herself .

		Of her many sorrows and perplex - ities , her personal trials , the letters give little sign .

		They are the chatty , rather objective , always spirited records of her travels and of her social experiences .

		She said much about others , little about her own work and her deeper life ; but one finds a fascinating amount of material regarding her friendships , her relationships , formal and informal , with distinguished folk of many lands to which her studies had led her .

		She travelled in
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, gaining a breadth of outlook quite unusual for a woman in those days .

		Quick to note natural beauty , or traits of character , or sig - nificant facts in art or architecture , she wrote in a lively , anecdotal style , and her whimsical , fem - inine , Celtic minuteness of detail gives her letters zest .

		Who can deny the charm of intimacy , at second hand , with the good and the great who appear in these pages ?

Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , makes no attempt to disguise her favorable opinion of
Huerta	PERSON	, who seems to have impressed her as little short of a hero .

		The period of Mr.
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	's occupancy of the
American Embassy	ORGANIZATION	as chief rep - resentative and defender of our interests in the troubled republic is covered , with much detail such as only a bright and observant woman could so vividly and vivaciously give , in these informal chats with the writer 's mother .

		Little more than half a year elapses in the 356 pages that contain such parts of this correspondence as were deemed fit for publication , and one can not find the nar - rative too long drawn out .

		Entering into the spirit of this narrative , and shutting one 's eyes to all other aspects of the writer 's theme , one can hardly fail to regret that the strong man so admired by Mrs.
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	had not been left unmolested to work out the destinies of his distracted country .

		In certain moods he is certainly no unpreposses - sing figure , as when he says of the imminent pros - pect of death that confronts him : `` It is the natural law , to which we must all submit .

		We were born into the world according to the natural law , and must depart according to it that is all . ''

		Two pages further on the author writes : `` Whatever else life might have in reserve for me , this last conversation with a strong man of another psychology than mine will remain engraven on my heart his calm , his philosophy on the eve of a war he knows can only end in disaster for himself and his people .

		His many faults , his crimes , even , his desperate expedients to sustain himself , his non-fulfilments all vanish .

		I know his spirit possesses something which will see him safely over the dark spaces and hours when they come . ''

		Professor
Patrick	PERSON	of the
University Psychology	ORGANIZATION	of , , , , , relaxation .

		*
Iowa	LOCATION	has brought together an interesting group of essays written with a consistent unity of purpose under the engaging title , `` The Psychology of Relaxation '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The theme includes such seemingly unrelated expressions of human nature as play , laughter , profanity , alcohol , and war ; yet they each express a significant form of the activities by which the tedium of life is relieved and a mental equilibrium restored .

		The theme is peculiarly timely with likewise a special pertinence to the American public .

		For the spirit of a people conies forward as characteristically in its recrea - tions as in its labors ; both reveal the temperamen - tal traits .

		The restless American finds expression in the amusement-mad pursuit of the `` movies , '' the new dances , the treating saloon , the comic supplements , the addiction to drugs , poker , the base-ball game , and the tendency to fads and isms .

		A saner employment would develop a more poised recreation .

		Underlying these varied expressions is a comprehensive psychology that takes its clue from the deeper meaning of play ; for we all must play , and even in business find the pattern of interest in playing the game .

		Theory and practice are equally illuminated by the expert psychological touch of the trained observer .

		The reader is carried along intelligently to an insight into the meaning of the social expressions of the day .

		The most serious theme is that of war , which attracts and concentrates the intenser strivings that make life vivid and real ; naturally one must count the cost .

		But it is significant that war sidetracks the social unrest , as fads absorb the energy generated by spiritual unrest .

		How a people responds to these persistent demands must ever remain a matter of moment to the intelligent observer of life .

		A physician 's Remarkable in a great many ways opinion of is `` The Memoirs of a Physician , translated from the Russian of Vikenty Veressayev by Mr.
Henry Pleasants	PERSON	, Jr. , and published by Mr.
Alfred Knopf	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is the recorded reaction of `` an average practi - tioner , with average ability and average knowl - edge '' to the conditions of life and work which meet such a man .

		His writing gives every evi - dence , even at cost to himself , of that absolute frankness which his introduction promises .

		With - out effort at concealment or evasion the author discusses the shortcomings of the equipment where - with the young medical man undertakes practice ; he reveals the pitfalls of unforeseeable event , acci - dent , and mistake which surround his path , una - voidable despite the most conscientious endeavor .

		He does not conceal the despair of his own soul at the realization of the insecure foundations whereon so much of therapeutics rests ; he rejoices in the recital of those things upon which he may with security lay hold and base his work .

		M. Veressayev enters very thoroughly into a consid - eration of the problems attendant on examination and autopsy as practised in public and academic clinics ; he discusses the difficulties of diagnosis ; he writes of the appalling lack of technique preva - lent among young doctors , and of the avoidable and inevitable risks of surgery .

		The status of medi - cine as an art , not a science , is treated in scholarly fashion ; the ancient bugbear of vivisection receives a quietus at the hands of common-sense .

		The translator appends - notes , many of which are valuable commentaries upon the text .

		The style of the book is easy , even colloquial at times , and not unpleasantly burdened with medical terminol - ogy .

		The translation seems adequate , though it is

L. Thatcher	PERSON	called `` A Book for
Shakespeare Plays	ORGANIZATION	and Pageants '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The book is primarily intended for those who would j celebrate in an intelligent way the greatness of j Shakespeare and his time by presenting his plays , with due regard to contemporary conditions and by producing pageants illustrative of Elizabethan festivals and activities ; but it also will serve as a guide to the student of the Elizabethan drama in that it brings together in compressed form much information about the external conditions that surrounded Shakespeare as a citizen and dramatist .

		;
Miss Thatcher	PERSON	brings out the significance in the production of plays and pageants of the royal revels and progresses , of the theatres and actors , : of amusements , music , and dress , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's j life and plays .

		The second part of the book , which is called U A Guide to the Pageant , '' contains valuable directions about the nature and consti - I tution of processions .

		The order of some actual \ processions is given , based on the state records ; I such as ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	's triumphal procession through |
London	LOCATION	on the way to her coronation and her j procession in
1588	DATE	, the year of the Armada .

		The j order of other processions is made up of fact and tradition , such as those of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's earlier years at
Stratford	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	.

		The suggestion is made that the processional elements of fact and tradition be distinguished by external symbols so that the episodes of the deer - stealing in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life be marked off from known biographical facts .

		Two chapters of this book contain the music of songs and dances with directions for the latter , and another gives consid - erable information about contemporary costum - ing .

		The illustrations are helpful and very numer - ous .

		On the whole the book is an excellent guide to the plays and the pageants of the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		In his latest volume Professor The beginning r7 .

		Krapp of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	shows that he is more than a philologist and Anglo-Saxon scholar .

		`` The Rise of English Lit - erary Prose '' -LRB-
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- establishes him as a literary historian of wide and accurate learning .

		His object j is to trace from Wy cliff e to
Bacon	PERSON	`` the growth of ' a temper and attitude of mind towards the use of I speech . ''

		His method , except for separate chap - j ters on Wy cliff e and
Bacon	PERSON	, is to summarize his - : torically in six sections various genres or move - > ments or groups such as the
Courtly Writers	ORGANIZATION	, the i Modernists , History and Antiquity , etc. .

		There is j surprisingly little technical discussion of style itself except in the chapter on
Courtly Writers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed ' a large part of the book consists of rather detailed !

		accounts of the many works treated often without any mention of style .

		The book is therefore a history of English prose from its real beginnings in
Wycliffe	LOCATION	down to
Bacon	LOCATION	, more than a history of English prose style .

		Many will feel that there is far too much biography and too much repeti - tion of the ordinary facts easily accessible in the text-books .

		We could wish that Professor Krapp had used some of this space to discuss , for example , the much vexed problem of the essay form .

		These are , however , not vital objections .

		The volume throws light into many dark and unknown corners .

		The attitude of the author is broad and humane throughout .

		The style is always readable .

		No other mountains , except those of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, declares a student of the literature of the subject , have been more written about , and it is rather strange that a really comprehensive chronological survey of the theme was not long ago given to the world .

		In Mr.

		Maps and numerous illustrations are not wanting , and , in short , the book seems to be exactly the right one for White Mountain visitors and intending visitors , as also for those who would like to be but can not be visitors , to read and enjoy at this season or any season of the year .

Ernest Bernbaum	PERSON	, makes an attempt by skilful argu - ment to establish a new view of sentimentalism in the eighteenth century .

		The author finds that in direct contrast to the humanistic view of life , senti - mentalism is based on the confidence in the good - ness of human nature .

		Thus , `` true comedy '' holds up the vices and follies of mankind for ridicule ; sentiemntal comedy distorts and palliates these vices and follies , and by an illegitimate appeal to the emotions makes them appear mere peccadilloes .

		`` Domestic tragedy , '' moreover , makes us weep with pity and joy over the suddenly reformed and bliss - fully virtuous sinner .

		Most of us will find it impossible to believe with Dr.
Bernbaum	PERSON	that restoration comedy has consistently high moral purpose , but his argument always provokes thought .

		231 HENRI DE RGGNIER .

		In the garden of an old French country mansion is a round marble fish-pond in the midst of which stands a green bronze
Triton	ORGANIZATION	spouting a white thread of water from his twisted shell .

		The garden is carefully ordered , with wide neat lawns bordered with myrtles , and with smooth paths between box - wood hedges .

		Along the sunniest wall are robust espalier fruits , downy peaches , sav - oury pears , and fragrant apricots .

		Graceful , tenuous , delicate people move along these paths and across these lawns ; beautiful girls scatter rose petals in the water under the bronze
Triton	ORGANIZATION	; philosophic abbes taste with rapture the juice of a `` ladies-thigh '' pear , and couples , gallant and highbred , sigh beneath the myrtles or consummate their affection behind a screen of bays , under the benign smile of a marble goddess , chipped and faintly stained with green moss .

		In that garden pass many of the scenes of M. de
Regnier	PERSON	's tranquil and exquisite novels a tranquillity which sometimes is broken by tragedy , more often by a gentle laugh ; an exquisiteness , palpable in his characters and in his silver prose , an exquisiteness never lost even in his most `` galant '' or realistic moments .

		For
M. de Begnier	ORGANIZATION	loves
France	LOCATION	, and he loves the eighteenth century without dis - daining his own ; he loves everything that can minister to senses delicate in themselves and refined with connoisseurship and good - breeding .

		He loves
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Somewhere or other in his `` Passe Vivant '' perhaps , he has a character who longs to travel in
Italy	LOCATION	and to re-live , with his memoirs , the adventures of Casanova .

		Those extraordinary memoirs of an extra - ordinary man , which once read are never forgotten , seem to have fascinated
M. de Regnier	ORGANIZATION	.

		One can well imagine him in
Venice	LOCATION	walking through the narrow `` calli '' behind the
Piazza	PERSON	in search of the scene of some Casanovian exploit , or taking a gondola for Chioggia and reading on the way
Casanova	ORGANIZATION	's 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	account of his pleasant and unpleasant adven - tures in that now inconsiderable town .

		M. de
Regnier	PERSON	has written several novels , and there is hardly one which does not touch , at least in part , upon
Italy	LOCATION	, the
Italy	LOCATION	of the eighteenth century .

		`` La Double Maitresse , '' which to me is M. de
Regnier	PERSON	's most attrac - tive work , passes partly in provincial
France	LOCATION	and partly in
Rome	LOCATION	, in a
Rome	LOCATION	so sensitively felt and presented that it becomes mingled witli the pictures one 's memory keeps of the real
Rome	LOCATION	and creates another and more fairy-like city of sun and churches and bells , antique monuments , cardinals and rogues !

		To the tradesman and to the Futurist no city is more uninteresting than
Rome	LOCATION	, though it be striated with tram-ways and leprous with white-plaster imitations of American archi - tecture .

		For a person of imagination , its attraction is inexhaustible .

		M. de
Regnier	PERSON	can not speak of it without making us love it more .

		For he is not of those who make literature from violence and from hatred .

		He is as much of an intellectual Epicure as
Anatole France	LOCATION	; and since in his novels he philoso - phizes less and enjoys more , the better
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- curean he !

		I do not know another writer living whose mere use of words gives me such pleasure as does M. de
Regnier	PERSON	; if he con - siders life from the Epicurean standpoint , how much more literature !

		One seems to taste his sentences , cool , savoury , and deli - cious .

		His ` books are baskets of fruits , warm , golden with sunshine , and colored red apples , yellow pears , gold grapes , purple grapes which he presents us with princely hauteur .

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		THE ART OF
JOSEPH CONRAD	PERSON	.

		The spectacle presented by such a writer as
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	is disturbing .

		He has been publishing tales and novels for twenty years now ; yet he has so little adaptability that he actually retains many of the virtues of the amateur : not the least of which is a complete innocence of mind with regard to the public 's view of his task .

		He refuses to see himself in the role of popular entertainer ; it is hardly surprising , therefore , if a good many people fail to find him entertaining .

		He is notori - ously wilful : he persists in writing what he wishes to write , precisely as he wishes to write it , without stopping to ask whether it is what the public may want to read .

		In fact , he has the air of deferring to his audience as little as possible .

		He has the simplicity , or the effrontery , to assert that the artist has his own dignity ; that he has a responsibility to his talent , whatever it may be ; and that this responsibility is , after all , his chief concern .

		In an age so triumphantly commercial that even the writer 's trade may be made commer - cially profitable , this is surely a suicidal her - esy .

		A discreet author holding such views would at least keep them to himself ; Mr.
Con	PERSON	- rad has no tact .

		He reveals the full measure of his innocence in the preface to `` The Nig - ger of the Narcissus , '' where he dares to plead for the artist 's right to be accepted on his own terms , to be allowed to do what he can do best : The sincere endeavor to accomplish this creative task -LSB- the perfect blending of form and substance -RSB- , to go as far on that road as his strength will carry him , to go undeterred by faltering , weariness , or reproach , is the only valid justification of the worker in prose .

		And if his conscience is clear his answer to those who , in the fulness of a wis - dom which looks for immediate profit , demand specifically to be edified , consoled , amused ; who demand to be promptly improved , or encouraged , or frightened , or shocked , or charmed , must run : My task which I am trying to achieve is , by the power of the written word , to make you hear , to make you feel , it is , before all , to make you see .

		That and no more , and it is everything .

		If I succeed , you shall find there according to your deserts : encouragement , consolation , fear , charm all you demand and , perhaps , also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask .

		Owing to this stiff-necked attitude , it is absolutely necessary , if you are to read Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's books at all , to accept both his method and his personality , a personality in which they are veritably steeped , a person - ality that is never repressed in the interest of any so-called objective rendering of things .

		Natures like his easily surrender the objective ideal as an allusion .

		However much the familiar human gesture may solicit their sym - pathy , it hardly tempts them to facile inter - pretations .

		They remain wary and more than a bit skeptical .

		Where so much remains unknown , why assume a knowing air over a few trifles ?

		It is a part of their veracity to present everything from a definite point of view : their own .

		So far as Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is concerned , he has avowedly accepted the say - ing of
Anatole France	LOCATION	that , when we no longer
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 173 have the self-control necessary to keep silent , we can talk only of ourselves .

		All his work has the air of a personal confession : his nov - els and tales no less than the strange and delightful books , full of mixed perspectives , a little umbrageous here and there , in which he has talked frankly to his readers as man to man .

		Indeed , he has already given us so much the measure of his tastes , opinions , and convictions in his fiction that attentive read - ers must have found little for which they were unprepared in `` A Personal Record . ''

		It served to clench our impressions ; that was all .

		Our curiosity as to facts is so much greater than our curiosity as to opinions that a writer with a relentlessly personal way of seeing things succeeds , if he succeeds at all , in spite of his point of view .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's success is not even now a broad one .

		Many readers , I know , think of him as paring life ruthlessly down to his preconceptions , and they will not have it .

		A habit that grows really out of his humility in the face of a puzzling world seems to them the expression of an immense and uneasy ego .

		They resent it especially in '' Youth , '' in `` Chance , '' in all the series of tales in which
Marlow	PERSON	appears as spokesman and Greek chorus .

		Now , it is certainly
Marlow	PERSON	who gives the tone , a little , in its unity and sobriety , the tone of time , and who is
Marlow	PERSON	but Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	?

		they want to know .

		Well , the point might be debated ; but let us yield it fully and freely , let us admit that
Marlow	PERSON	is Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	.

		What then ?

		For those of us who know how to savor it , that tone is precisely one of the charms of our author ; it is what we would least willingly spare in him .

		It gives us the sense of com - paring notes with an experienced and subtle observer who does us the honor of letting us completely into the secret , who does not keep us in the dark as to his own values .

		But even such candor as his often goes for nothing , actually helps , indeed , to build up a false impression .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	passes with many readers for an ironical spirit ; it is one of the adjectives most frequently applied to him wrongly , as I believe .

		At least of the irony that is truly wounding he has almost nothing .

		A mature writer , he spares us his illusions .

		Certainly he avoids sentimentality ; but when has a nov - elist been forced to choose between irony and its reverse ?

		Doubtless he is suspect because of what is known of his tastes .

		Anyone can see that he has formed himself on French rather than English models .

		His eloquence and his volubility are not in the best English tradition , any more than his fastidiousness is .

		His admiration for
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	is no secret .

		Indeed , I suspect him of having read with a peculiar sympathy the whole group of artis - tic writers that flourished towards the
end of the last century	DATE	.

		But if these Frenchmen did influence him , it was rather on the plastic side .

		In the first place , he has none of the inhumanity of the studio writers , a moral obtuseness more shocking to good sense than any mere insensibility to beauty .

		And then , he does not intellectualize his impressions .

		He sees everything through the softening , reconciling light of the emotions : the plight of Lord
Jim	PERSON	, the simple and tremendous devo - tion of Captain
Whalley	PERSON	, the bizarre fate of the unspeakable
Kurtz	PERSON	.

		Irony lies in him close to pity , the pity of the great Slavic writers whose inspiration he is fortunate enough to share .

		It is as far as possible from the irony of a Maupassant or of an
Anatole France	LOCATION	, from that of the Gallic genius gen - erally .

		It seems to me to be nothing more heartless than an alert sense of the amusing and tragic disproportion of things , a pardon - able reluctance to figure as the dupe of one 's outraged emotions .

		It is pity stiffened and made virile by a calm acceptance of the ter - restrial show .

		Such pity will hardly be hys - terical or exasperated ; it will have its own decent reserves .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's stoical acceptance of things as they are , creates something of the effect of a reasoned philosophy .

		In reality , he is unique among modern writers in the degree in which he combines a complicated manner with the greatest simplicity of substance .

		His values have undergone no transvaluation with
Nietzsche	PERSON	or with
Ibsen	PERSON	; it is hard to imagine him breathing the same air with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		It is no use denying that if he did not claim and delightfully vindicate his right to make an added charm even of his limitations , his philosophy would hardly suffice to grapple with so bristling a problem as our modern industrial civilization .

		Its characteristic vir - tues too often escape his eye ; its vices stand out like quills on the porcupine .

		He suspects us dwellers in cities of vast sophistries , of oblique and incalculable processes .

		The hypocrisy and intrigue of business revolt him .

		They are constantly driving him to take ref - 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	uge on the sea , among men whose vices are the instinctive animal vices and whose inno - cence emerges triumphant from pothouse and brothel .

		Observe how he bridles when he seeks , in `` Chance , '' to give us some notion of the whole twisted and inexplicable structure of modern finance .

		He really can not bring himself to depict for us the chicane by which de Barral kept himself precariously afloat .

		We are led to suspect that he does not understand it .

		He frets , like his own Captain
Anthony	PERSON	, to be away on the sea , where men lead clean lives and struggle only with the elements , trafficking in real things and not in money .

		This contempt for trade runs like a refrain through tale after tale of the tropical oceans .

		He , ignores , in other words , precisely that aspect of our modern world that is most worthy of attention .

		Nor is it our trade alone that he finds dis - tasteful : our whole complicated way of taking things strikes him , I fancy , as a little confus - ing .

		Intellectual virtuosity , especially in the realm of morals , leaves him cold .

		Mankind ought , he says , to be impressionable rather than reflective .

		`` Nothing humanely great great , I mean , as affecting a whole mass of lives has come from reflection . ''

		Or , again : `` Those who read me know my con - viction that the world , the temporal world , rests on a very few simple ideas ; so simple that they must be as old as the hills .

		It rests notably , among others , on
Fidelity	ORGANIZATION	! ''

		There is nothing revolutionary in such a confession of faith .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	renders homage to a few
august	DATE	or simple moods of the human spirit : to courage , on the one .

		hand , and to loyalty ; on the other , to that unheroic ade - quacy to the day 's work which is the cement of society .

		He likes to see these primitive virtues given their freest play in a primitive world .

		He delights to show how the wild places of the earth work upon and alter our conventional attitudes and judgments .

		Such as survive the test are men .

		But even so , they must be prepared to get along without the rewards .

		In Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's pages people never win happiness by deserving it .

		His veracity will allow nothing of the sort .

		Nor does he feel any obligation to make out so facile a case for the morality of the universe .

		`` The ethical view of the universe involves us at last in so many cruel and absurd contradictions , where the last vestiges of faith , hope , charity , and even reason itself , seem ready to perish , that I have come to suspect that the aim of creation can not be ethical at all .

		I would fondly believe that its object is purely spec - tacular : a spectacle for awe , love , adoration , or hate , if you like , but in this view and in this view alone never for despair ! ''

		If living in such a universe Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is still not a pessimist , I suspect it is largely because he finds people acquitting themselves with a decent show of courage .

		The spectacle of that courage is , I feel sure , one of the things he prizes most ; his tranquility in a world he thinks of as , on the whole , rather cruel and hard is doubtless the result of his waiting so confidently for some fresh evidence of the sufficiency of man 's spirit .

		But for such an attitude no very profound kind of philosophy is required .

		Two qualities stand between Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	and a wide public : his veracity and his love of beauty .

		The splendid cadence of his prose makes more irritating the `` barbaric yawp '' of much contemporary verse .

		His style is rich , harmonious , and varied , living and full of warmth .

		Only occasionally does one feel the tedium of word painting , never in his later work .

		Yet he abounds in pictures struck off swiftly and with fine imaginative suffi - ciency , pictures of the gleaming tranquility of waters under a tropical sun ; of the sud - den , appalling onrush of storms and their maniacal fury ; of the immemorial calm of the jungle , brooding inert over a teeming and mysterious activity .

		The effect is always large and free , as of a globe swimming in ether , a sea empty to the horizon .

		And this vastness , this aloofness of nature is set over against the feverish comings and goings of men , crawling with oars up tropical rivers between endless banks of mud , risking infec - tion , madness , death , all manner of nameless evils for the sake of a little bread .

		No one is a more consummate master of atmosphere , not the atmosphere of places alone , but the atmosphere in which certain profound inner moods develop as well .

		What one of his early French critics called a puissant dreamer , he is a writer who must absolutely be read on his own terms .

		You have to yield to him , to his compelling moods , to his point of view , to his values , while you read .

		But the effort is well worth making ; for he is one of the few living writers of romance who can take readers out of themselves without taking them out of real - itv also .

		GEORGE
BERNARD DONLIN	PERSON	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 175 CASUAL COMMENT .

		ANCIENT GREEK PROTOTYPES OF FREE VERSE seem to come readily enough to mind if one looks back upon one 's school and college days when , in the good old-fashioned classical course , a stern struggle with the Greek tragic poets was a part of the curriculum .

		How hard it was to scan those irregular lines of the chorus , which of course had no rhyme , and seemed at first equally devoid of reason in their metrical structure .

		But it was not in accord with the severity of the Greek genius : to run riot all over the page even with these hard-to-scan verses .

		It was to our schoolboy eyes a mighty maze , but we still had confi - dence that it was not without a plan ; and occasionally this plan was indicated in the notes by a succession of those symbols used to designate long and short syllables , with the accents properly distributed and the whole divided into feet .

		It is of interest in this con - nection to chance upon a writer in the Lon - don `` Nation '' -LRB- of no very recent date , it is true , but none the less quotable -RRB- who has not failed to note the classical antiquity of the style of verse here referred to .

		He says with truth that `` many things in the modern poet - ical movement which pass for new are very old indeed .

		The vers libre is an example .

		The Greeks had their irregular dithyrambic verse , while in English we had
Skelton	PERSON	's rag - ged rhyme , and the irregular verses of
Blake	PERSON	's Prophetic Books . ''

		French examples are also cited , and the undeniable rarity of any new thing under the sun is again impressed upon us .

		But there is such a thing as inferior imi - tation of a very old and at one time highly - approved pattern , and so the writer does well to add : `` There are poems by some of our latest poets which remind one of the artist , an imitator of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, who .

		gazing in admira - tion at one of his own pictures , exclaimed : ' What would old Tit think of this ? ' ''

		A WAR OF ATTRITION ON OUR ORTHOGRAPHY is always being waged , and its slow and sure results are not all to be regretted .

		For instance , the early forms , authour and roiall , have wisely been discarded for the simpler -RRB- and etymologically preferable spellings now in j use .

		No violence is done to things inviolable j by such simplifications .

		Somewhat less inno - i cent are the modifications not long ago sanc - tioned by the
Illinois Daily Newspaper Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation in adopting the `` list of twelve words proposed in
1898	DATE	and in use since by the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This list is as follows : `` Tho , altho , thru , thruout , thoro , ' thoroly , thoro fare , program , prolog , catalog , decalog , pedagog . ''

		And yet there is something to be said either on etymological or analogical grounds , or both , for each of these abbrevi - ated forms .

		The librarians have long since made us familiar with catalog , and little pro- test is raised except when it comes to cata - loged and cataloging and cataloger , which vio - lates a good rule concerning hard g and soft g. Thru , tho , and thoro , with their derivatives , are a little hard for the queasy stomach to digest , but the other proffered pills are easier of assimilation .

		Twelve words in seventeen years is not so rapid a rate of progress as the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	would like to see , although if that comparatively swift trans - formation of our spelling were to be gener - ally approved and were to continue , grave concern might well be aroused .

		At present let us be thankful that matters are no worse .

		No newspaper association exerts unbounded influence in things of this sort , and it may well be seven times seventeen years , or even longer , before the English-writing world becomes reconciled to thru and tho ; and by that time even a possible deluge would have little interest for ns .

		PENALTIES OF LITERATURE that is , of the literary calling are very real .

		Some would say they overbalance its pleasures .

		No man , it has been plausibly maintained , loves the work that he is compelled to do for daily bread .

		Perhaps this work has something of the character of the typical woman , the woman to whom a man finds himself attached and whom he can neither get along with nor without .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	, under contract to furnish six jokes daily , at sixpence a joke ' , to the `` Morning Post , '' found only drudgery in what had before been a recreation and delight .

		`` No Egyptian taskmaster , '' he moaned , `` ever devised a slavery like to that , our slavery .

		, ' .

		Half a dozen jests in a day -LRB- bating
Sundays	DATE	, too -RRB- , why , it seems nothing !

		We make twice the number every day in our lives as a mat - ter of course , and claim no Sabbatical exemp - tion .

		But then they come into our head .

		But when the head has to go out to them when the mountain must go to Mahomet reader , try it once , only for one short twelvemonth . ''


Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, on the rare occasions when he was called out of the eighteenth century to view his literary pursuits as a means of earn - ing bread for himself and family , was wont to become panic-stricken , and `` there would be thunderings and lightnings and the gloomiest vaticinations , '' as his biographer tells us .

		`` The doors of the workhouse would yawn 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	before his eyes , '' and the writer 's calling would seem the most wretched , the least remunerative , of all possible occupations .

		A certain successful
London	LOCATION	journalist of twelve .

		years ' standing , who has recently become a successful novelist , is quoted in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript '' as follows : `` When I was work - ing in a draper 's shop I yearned to be a journalist ; but I have had as much as I want of it .

		The strain of it , the need for being ever - lastingly on the lookout for new ideas , the horror of seeing your circulation fluctuate and threaten to fall off the worry of it all is n't good enough .

		I think of the happiness and ease of my old drapery days with real regret . ''

		And he is now looking for a place in a draper 's shop at two pounds a week , or even a little less , `` well outside
London	LOCATION	. ''

		He concludes : `` Ambition is all very well , but I want a life that 's worth living . ''

		Another successful journalist and novelist , quoted by the same writer , complains of the precarious - ness of his calling .

		`` What I long for , '' he declares , `` is a dead certainty and work in the open air .

		I want to get back to something more like what I was used to before I began pushing the pen . ''

		Accordingly he is now exerting himself to secure an appointment as keeper at
Richmond Park	LOCATION	, where he will have nothing to do but walk about and look after the deer .

		`` It will only mean thirty shillings or so a week , '' he admits , `` but I 'm a single man and can live on that and be happy . ''

		Our notions of success in life undergo remark - able modifications as we grow older .

		A STIMULUS TO EPISTOLARY ART should be hailed with a joyous welcome in these days of alleged decline in the elegant accomplish - ment of letter-writing ; and such a stimulus , cheering the beholder like a fair flower
spring	DATE	- ing from a noisome bog , we see exerted by the present lamentable quarrel of nations on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Hardly a news - paper can one open without encountering a racy selection of `` letters to the editor , '' sifted out of a mass far too bulky to be printed in full ; and the richness of epithet with which the editorial attitude toward the war is alter - nately commended and condemned , by differ - ent correspondents , goes a long way toward proving that the art of vigorous and pictur - esque expression in epistolary form has suf - fered little or no decline since
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	and Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	and
Horace Walpole	PERSON	unbosomed themselves so freely and fluently to their distant friends .

		So indulgent toward their correspondents of every creed and party are our latter-day editors that one may enjoy , in these columns thus generously given up to open letters from all parts of the world , the most varied exhi - bitions of enthusiastic assent to the views of the journal concerned , and of the very dissi - dence of dissent .

		Surely , for variety and spice , the correspondence page of the news - paper , in the troublous times we are now passing through , is not so dreary reading as it might be .

		THE QUESTION OF BOOK-PINES will long remain a fruitful theme for discussion wher - ever and whenever library topics are in order .

		The small penalty of
two cents	MONEY	a day imposed for retention of a book over time has caused a disproportionate amount of vexation and irri - tation to all concerned .

		This irritant or counter-irritant one might call it where fines are paid , or quarreled over and not paid , at the counter devoted to the return of books seems to be a necessary evil , human nature and human delinquency being what they are .

		A library of the size of that used by the citi - zens of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, for instance , receives more than
ten thousand dollars	MONEY	a year in fines ; but against this should be set the time and trouble and expense of collecting the tens of thou - sands of small sums composing this total .

		At Grand Rapids , as the latest library Report from that city indicates , 213 notices were sent out to as many persons in an attempt to collect
$ 72.28	MONEY	in unpaid fines .

		Postage on these polite duns was of course at letter rates , or
$ 4.26	MONEY	for the 213 notices .

		Envelopes , printing , about sixteen hours spent in looking up addresses and preparing the messages for mailing , with other details - , must have added considerably to the cost of the undertaking ; and the total returns amounted to
$ 13.58	MONEY	paid by 62 of the 213 delinquents .

		More consci - entious than many of these 151 obdurate ones are likely ever to show themselves , was the person who , after more than fifteen years of unresponsiveness , finally paid a book-fine of something over a dollar into the treasury of the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and enjoyed thenceforth , it is to be presumed , an appreciable ease of mind .

		In the ideal library of our dreams there will , of course , be no fines : books will not be returnable on any fixed date , and yet they will always be found in their places on the shelves when they are wanted ; and the latest popular novel will never be asked for in vain .

		THE CATALOGUE GAME , as it is called , with a slightly different spelling , in the annual Report of the
Oak Park Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 177 there described in a passage that is likely to interest some readers of this paragraph .

		-LRB- But , first , and by way of parenthesis , why do the Oak Park library authorities assume that their Oak Park is the Oak Park of Amer - ica ?

		There are four places of this name in the
United States	LOCATION	, as enumerated in the '' Cen - tury Atlas , '' so that the addition of ``
Illinois	LOCATION	'' in this instance would not come amiss .

		How - ever , `` Oak Park , '' pure and simple , is less perplexing than would be `` Oak Grove , '' a name borne by no fewer than nineteen towns and villages and other communities in this country . -RRB-

		`` The catalog game , '' we read , `` included children of the fifth as well as the sixth , seventh , and eighth grades , and the interest was keen thruout the contest .

		Fol - lowing the talks referred to in the school libraries report , the catalog game in the chil - dren 's room came as one of the most inter - esting and probably the most helpful of the year 's activities .

		Every
Saturday	DATE	for several weeks a set of three questions was posted near the catalog in the children 's room .

		The answers to the questions found by the use of the catalog were written out and handed in for correction , and an honor roll was posted each week , giving the successful contestants as well as the successful schools .

		A similar contest was held at the south branch , and in all more than a thousand papers were handed in for correction , prizes being given to the successful contestants .

		As a result of the game the catalog is used with greater free - dom and intelligence . ''

		More than one over - worked librarian and assistant will wish that some such game might become popular among adult library-users , so often do these latter needlessly and thoughtlessly throw the bur - den of catalogue-consultation upon the mem - bers of the librarv staff .

		A NEW USE FOE `` ESQUIRE '' Suggests itself to a writer in `` The Sphere , '' and the sug - gestion ought to be welcome ; for no more meaningless or more carelessly used title exists in our language .

		This remnant of the `` frippery of the Middle Ages , '' as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	once called it , has come to be indis - criminately applied to the land-owner , the lawyer , the man of letters , the financier , the gentleman of leisure , and , in our country , to nearly every one of the male sex and adult j years .

		All this is finely democratic , and if j the rag-picker likes to have his letters I addressed `` Mr.
Joseph Judkins	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, '' who j shall deny him the right to this wealth of i titles ?

		But such usage does not make for pre - 1 eision in the choice of terms .

		Since the i squire , or esquire , is etymologically a shield - bearer -LRB- as scutarius , from scutum , indicates -RRB- , why not , it is asked , let the title be henceforth given to those who have borne arms in war - fare on land or have served in the navy , and have retired to private life ?

		Thousands of brave and worthy young Englishmen would thus , after the present war , receive graceful recognition of their gallantry in their coun - try 's service .

		It is true , our traditional scorn of titles -LRB- which coexists with an increas - ing addiction to academic and other distinc - tions -RRB- deprives this question of vital interest for us ; but the etymologist and the lover of nice accuracy in the use of language will applaud this attempt to reinvest a good old word with something like its original meaning .

		UNWELCOME LIBRARY VISITORS have fur - nished a theme for various writers , notably Mr.
William Blades	PERSON	, whose readable treatise on `` The Enemies of Books '' is known to most bookish persons of this country and
England	LOCATION	.

		But while he discourses learnedly and enter - tainingly on the bookworm , the black beetle , the rat , the lepisma , and sundry other ani - mate and inanimate foes to literature , he says not a word about the white ant , which Mr
Samuel H. Ranck	PERSON	of Grand Rapids reports to have committed sad ravages in the library of which he is the head .

		It is true that the attacks of this proverbially industrious insect were not directed primarily against the books ; but the resultant damage to them might have been considerable had not the mischief been discovered before it became irreparable .

		Through cracks in the concrete floor of the catalogue room , where strips of wood had been used for nailing down the cork matting , the invading hosts had made their entrance and had declared war on the oak bookcases of the library .

		Varnish or paint , let it be noted , had checked their progress , but into unfinished surfaces of oak they bored their way with destructive effect .

		Several hundred dollars ' worth of bookcases proved , upon examination , to be so infested and honey - combed as to be a total loss .

		These cases were burned and precautions were taken to render the others ant-proof .

		Tar for the bottom and varnish elsewhere were applied .

		Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	writes , in closing his account of this cam - paign : `` Some of the oak cases infested by the ants were literally honeycombed .

		From the outside they looked as substantial as ever , but one could run a knife through an inch and a half piece of what was presumably solid white oak .

		Enough of the wood remained to keep the cases from collapsing from the 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	weight upon them , but some were in such a condition that they would soon have crumbled from the weight upon them had we not dis - covered the ants . ''

		The obvious moral of all this is that either metal cases should be used in book-shelf construction , or if wood is used it should be kept well varnished and should be made especially ant-proof where it rests on the floor .

		BY THE SHORES OF OLD ROMANCE there may be found , almost any week-day , at one or more of the branches of a large city library , a group of eager-eyed children listening to the story-teller whose duty and pleasure it is to hold their undivided attention to some entrancing bit of fiction during the story - hour .

		Of course we presuppose here a skilled story-teller and a juvenile audience from which the hopelessly inattentive have been weeded out .

		What the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as a fair sample -RRB- is doing for the young folks in this branch of its work may be gath - ered from a passage or two selected from its current Report .

		`` One can hardly overesti - mate , '' it is stated , `` the value of the story - hour , not only as an introduction to good reading , but as a civilizing and refining influ - ence in the lives of the boys and girls .

		It devel - ops concentration , self-control , sympathy , mutual understanding , and happy comrade - ship .

		Those who have frequented the story hour for a year are a leaven among the shift - ing company in the children 's room that may be made a help in setting and keeping stand - ards of conduct there . ''

		And further : `` The story-hour has made its place in the Library on its merits .

		There are none now to ques - tion its position .

		Our own group here at the library is composed of about 75 to 100 boys who have attended regularly since
the first hour three years ago	DATE	... Many of them who have attended from the beginning are now in high school , but are not yet ` too big ' for stories .

		In fact , to some of them the story - hour has proven a connecting link between the fields of grammar school endeavor and the many strange paths opened to them in high school .

		If he has heard the story of the Odyssey or the JEneid , the boy will at least know that what he is trying to read in Greek or Latin is really worth reading , though it is rather difficult to translate . ''

		It should be added , to correct a possible wrong impression from the foregoing , that in
Boston	LOCATION	as else - where the girls considerably outnumber the boys as story-hour attendants .

		PROMOTING THE POPULARITY OP THE
DIC	ORGANIZATION	- TIONARY , as a book either of entertainment or of eagerly desired knowledge , might seem to be a well-nigh hopeless undertaking .

		Yet with a very little encouragement the public may develop an astonishing interest in this far from sensational product of the pen .

		At
Buffalo	LOCATION	, as is reported from the free library of that city , an experiment has been made in offering for circulation , on the open shelves , a number of the best small English diction - aries ; and they have speedily become popu - lar , which has led to the addition of similar dictionaries and also grammars of the Ger - man , French , Italian , and Spanish languages .

		Many copies of these books are now in con - stant use , it is said , whereas before their exposure to public view there was compara - tively little demand for them .

		All this goes to prove once more the existence among the people of a considerable book-hunger of a vague sort , which can be and ought to be directed toward a wholesome and appetizing literary diet .

		Wholesome the dictionary has always been acknowledged to be ; appetizing it remained for Mr.
Walter L. Brown	PERSON	and his staff to prove it to be .

		THE ROUND TABLE has figured prominently in story and legend , in poem and romance , so that the very name carries with it charmed associations .

		When King
Arthur	PERSON	married Guinevere he received as a wedding present the famous table made by
Merlin	ORGANIZATION	, which would seat one hundred and fifty knights ; and with it he also received a hundred knights , who became the Knights of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	, as all the world knows .

		At
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	there is on exhibition a table known as `` Arthur 's Round Table , '' but very little like the famous piece of furniture described by
Malory	ORGANIZATION	.

		A legendary king of
Ireland	LOCATION	, father of Christabelle , also had his `` knights of the Round Table , '' and
Roger de Mortimer	PERSON	established at
Kenilworth	LOCATION	still another
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	for `` the encourage - ment of military pastimes . ''

		Somewhat later
Edward III	ORGANIZATION	.

		had his Round Table at Wind - sor , and it was said to be two hundred feet in diameter , which would provide for a very goodly company of knights and still leave room for their ladies .

		And a circle compris - ing both sexes we do indeed find in a much later age the transition is rather violent as described in the following passage from Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's Report of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Public Library : `` Staff Round Table .

		One of the pleasant features of the life in the
Library	ORGANIZATION	is a meeting of the heads of departments and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 179 branch librarians for the purpose of review - ing and examining the new books , and dis - cussing questions of Library policy and prac - tice , and other matters of current interest .

		These meetings are held usually on alternate
Thursday	DATE
mornings	TIME	, sometimes more fre - quently when the books are coming in large numbers , and at longer intervals during the
summer	DATE	.

		A couple of hours are spent in reviewing the books which have been read and are reported on by the various members of the staff .

		A social half-hour follows , which affords the members of the staff , who are widely scattered throughout the city , the opportunity of becoming better acquainted , comparing notes , and receiving some of that stimulus which comes with the association of those engaged in the same work . ''

		From Cam - elot to
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, is a far cry ; but this speedy covering of enormous distances is nothing new to the twentieth century .

		THE INTEREST IN POETRY , and literature about poetry , has been most astonishing and pleasant to behold of late .

		Everybody is talk - ing about poets , or attempting to write poems .

		The
English Association	ORGANIZATION	announces that the demand for poetry in
England	LOCATION	has been out of all proportion to any previous records .

		Wordsworth .

		Shelley , and
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	are alike selling at an unusual rate .

		The
Poetry Society of America	ORGANIZATION	has just awarded two prizes , of
$ 125	MONEY	each .

		Rewards , like that of the Art League of
St. Louis	LOCATION	,
$ 150	MONEY	in value , for the best lyric poem submitted by an American , indicate an official interest in poetry .


Katherine Howard	PERSON	is traveling the
West	LOCATION	organizing so-called poetry societies .

		In various universities the revival has been marked .


Washington University	ORGANIZATION	and Har -
vard University	ORGANIZATION	both possess groups of stu - dents who gather to criticize their own poet - ical productions .

		A strong and flourishing
Poetry Society	ORGANIZATION	has been established at the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, from whose faculty it has obtained for the following year , a course whose subject the society will choose .

		Such books as `` Methods and Aims in the Study of Literature : a Series of Extracts and Illustrations , '' by
Lane Cooper	PERSON	-LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are being printed for the advancement of these interests in children .

		The present gen - eration will be brought up on newer and fresher methods of education .

		No longer in the schools will poetry be studied as a mere succession of `` soul thrills . ''

		but as `` an intel - lectual wrestling with the poet 's spirit , a determination like
Jacob	PERSON	's , not to let the gpirit depart without a blessing / ' COMMUNICATIONS .

		THE NEW SAPPHO FRAGMENT IN ENGLISH VEBSE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Reading the clean-cut and melodious prose trans - lation of the lately discovered Sappho fragment recently printed in your pages , I venture to send you the following rendition of the same poem in the Sapphic verse itself .

		It is heresy , of course , even to attempt those rhythms which Horatius Flaccus found so difficult in his antique and quan - titative Latin .

		But where
Swinburne	PERSON	has opened up such a fluent and melodious poetic path in English , perhaps it were the better policy if we tread it before the language changes and the blazed posts are felled .

		I have endeavored in this paraphrase -LRB- for it is hardly a translation -RRB- to avoid those common pitfalls of the participles and articular verse-endings which so often have destroyed in English the effects and beauties of the ^ Eolic medium .

		Verse for verse 's sake has been my principle .

		O great
Hera	LOCATION	, sovereign of wind and water , Bid that shining vision to stand beside me Wrapt in dreams , the beauteous wraith appear - ing Softly aforetime , When the storied lords of the seed of Atreus Prayed to thee , great .

		queen , and it rose beside them , Answer bright of prayer , and they brought to finish
Ilion	LOCATION	's leaguer .

		For when first they launched in the sea their vessels , Left at
last Scamander	DATE	, and turned them hither , Home they might not reach , nor their wives , nor children , Ere that a season
Fain	PERSON	was Atreus ' seed for a prayer in trouble , Lifting up their mantle to thee , white
Hera	LOCATION	, Thee with shining Zeus , and besought the lovely Child of Thyone .

		Even now , my goddess , I pray as they prayed , Yearn that I through thee , as of old , may suffer There among the maidens of Mytilene Only the sweetest , Noblest , purest deeds , as of old I suffered , Once again the maidens of Mytilene Whom thy Sappho led in the melic chorus Feast day to feast day ; Yea , and as through thee and the gods about thee , Even Atreus ' seed of aforetime ventured Forth from Troy , embarqued on the wine-dark billows , Turning prows homeward , Even so I too in this prayer beseech thee ,
Gentle Hera	LOCATION	, sovereign of wind and water , Aid thou me this barque on the homeward voyage ,
Fain	PERSON	for thy shelter !

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Where did
Browning	PERSON	find the story which he turned into verse to amuse sick little
William Macready	PERSON	?

		I have at hand the `` Fireside Edition '' of the poet 's works , in which I read : ``
Browning	PERSON	found it in
Nathaniel Wanley	PERSON	's Wonders of the
Little World	LOCATION	, or A
General History of Man	ORGANIZATION	, pub - lished in
1678	DATE	; but he probably used also the version given in
Richard Verstegan	PERSON	's Restitution of
Decayed Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	published in
1605	DATE	. ''

		A learned friend refers me to
James Howell	PERSON	's `` Familiar Letters , '' section 6 , number 47 .

		Finally , in his `` Browning Bibliography , '' Professor
Furnivall	PERSON	refers in a note to Prosper
Merimee	PERSON	's `` Chronique du Regne de
Charles IX	PERSON	, '' where the same story is told .

		I have not seen
Wanley	ORGANIZATION	's account ;
Howell	PERSON	's version is very brief , and is supposed to be based on Verstegan .

		The incident as related by
Merimee	PERSON	bears very close resemblance to
Browning	PERSON	's poem , and in common with it con - tains some touches that are not in Verstegan -LRB- as quoted in the `` Fireside Edition '' -RRB- nor in
Howell	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , there are touches in
Verstegan	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	which are not in
Merimee	LOCATION	.

		Among the former I would mention the church window and the end of the mountain story .

		In
Merimee	PERSON	's account , a young Protestant cavalier named Mergy falls in with a wandering band of German mer - cenaries accompanied by two women .

		One of these women , `` une jeune boheme '' called
Mila	PERSON	, relates the following story : '' Captain , you have without doubt been at
Hameln	LOCATION	? ''

		`` Never . ''

		`` And you , Cornette ? ''

		`` No . ''

		`` What !

		Shall I find no one who has been at
Hameln	LOCATION	I '' `` I have passed a year there , '' said a cavalier , com - ing forward .

		` Well ,
Fritz	PERSON	, you have seen the church at
Hameln	LOCATION	? ''

		` More than a hundred times . ''

		` And its colored windows ? ''

		` Certainly . ''

		` And what did you see painted on those windows ? ''

		` On those windows ?

		On the window at the left , I think there is a tall black fellow who is playing the flute , and some small children who are running after him . ''

		`` Precisely .

		Well , I am going to tell you the story of that black fellow and those children .

		A great many years ago the people of
Hameln	LOCATION	were tormented by an innumerable multitude of rats who came from the north , in troops so thick that the earth was black with them .

		No carter would have dared to drive his horse across a road where these animals were march - ing .

		Every thing was devoured in less than no time , and in a granary it was a smaller matter for those rats to eat a hogshead of wheat than for me to drink a glass of this good wine . ''

		She drank , wiped her mouth and continued : `` Mouse traps , rat traps , all kinds of traps , poison , were useless .

		They got from
Bremen	LOCATION	a boat loaded with eleven hundred cats , but nothing availed .

		For a thousand that they killed , ten thousand came back , more famished than the first .

		In short , if there had not come a remedy for this scourge , not a grain of wheat would have remained in
Hameln	LOCATION	and all the inhabitants would have died of hunger .

		Then on a certain
Friday	DATE	there came before the burgomaster of the city a tall fellow , tanned , dried-up , with big eyes , a mouth that reached from ear to ear , clad in a red doublet , with a pointed hat , wide breeches , furbished with ribbons , gray stockings , and slippers with fine colored rosettes .

		He had a little leathern sack at his side .

		It seems to me that I see him still . ''

		All eyes turned involuntarily toward the wall on which
Mila	PERSON	was fixing her eyes .

		`` You saw him , then ? ''

		asked Mergy .

		`` No , not I , but my grandmother ; and she remem - bered so well his face that she could have painted his portrait . ''

		`` And what did he say to the burgomaster ? ''

		`` He offered , for one hundred ducats , to deliver the city of the pest which was devastating it .

		You may easily imagine that the burgomaster and the towns - men agreed at once .

		Immediately the stranger drew from his sack a bronze flute , and standing in the market-place before the church , but with his back to it note that he began to play a strange air , such a one as never German flutist had played .

		Behold that on hearing this air rats and mice , by hundreds , by thousands , ran towards him from all the lofts , from all the wall holes , from beneath the rafters and the tiles of the roofs .

		The stranger , always playing , started toward the
Weser	LOCATION	; there , having pulled off his trousers , he entered the water followed by all tho rats of
Hameln	LOCATION	, and they were promptly drowned .

		There no longer remained but a single one in all the city , and you shall see why .

		The magician for he was one asked a sluggard who had not yet entered the
Weser	PERSON	why
Klauss	PERSON	, the white rat , had not come .

		` Seigneur , ' answered the rat , ` he is so old that he can no longer walk . '

		` Go , then , and bring him yourself , ' answered the magician .

		And the rat turned back toward the city , whence he soon returned with the big white rat , so old , so old , that he could not drag himself along .

		The two rats , the younger pulling the older by the tail , both entered the
Weser	PERSON	and were drowned like their comrades .

		Thus was the city purged of them .

		But when the stranger presented himself at the city hall to receive the prom - ised recompense , the burgomaster and the townsmen , reflecting that they had nothing more to fear from rats , and imagining they could easily rebuff a man without protection , were not ashamed to offer him ten ducats , instead of the hundred they had promised .

		The stranger protested ; they mocked him .

		He threatened to exact a dearer price if they did not co ` mpletely fulfill their bargain .

		The townsmen burst out in great peals of laughter at this threat , and put him out of the town hall , calling him ` Fine rat - catcher I ' an insult which the children of the city repeated as they followed him through the streets as far as the
Porte Neuve	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following
Friday	DATE	, at the noon hour , the stranger reappeared in the market place , but this time with a hat of purple color , turned up in a very strange fashion .

		He drew from his sack a flute quite different from the first , and , as soon as he had begun to play , all the boys of the city , from six to fifteen years , followed him and left the city . ''

		`` And the inhabitants of
Hameln	LOCATION	let them be led away ? ''

		asked at the same time Mergy and the captain .

		`` They followed as far as the mountain of
Koppen	PERSON	- berg , to a cavern which is now blocked up .

		The flute player entered the cavern and all the children with him .

		The sound of the flute was heard for some time , gradually died away , and finally was heard no more .

		The children had disappeared , and since then have never been heard from . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 181 The gypsy stopped to observe upon the features of her audience the effect produced by her recital .

		The mercenary who had been at
Hameln	LOCATION	observed : `` This history is so true that , when they speak at
Hameln	LOCATION	of any extraordinary event , they say : `` That happened twenty years , ten years , after the departure of our children the seigneur of
Falkenstein	PERSON	pil - laged our city sixty years after the departure of our children . '

		`` But the most curious thing , '' said
Mila	PERSON	, `` is that at the same time there appeared , very far from there in
Transylvania	LOCATION	, certain children who spoke good German , and who could not tell whence they < - ame .

		They married in the country , taught their language to their children , whence it comes that even to this day German is spoken in
Transylvania	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Are those the children of
Hameln	LOCATION	that the devil transported there ? ''

		asked Mergy , smiling .

		`` I attest that that is true ! ''

		cried the captain , '' for I have been in
Transylvania	LOCATION	, and I know that German is spoken there , while all around they speak an infer - nal gibberish . ''

		The attestation of the captain was worth many of the proofs of which we have a profusion .

		i I have translated the Trench as accurately as j possible .

		The reader must draw his own conclu - ' sions .

		Merimee was a gifted linguist , and knew ; many tongues , including English .

		Perhaps he found the story in folk-lore , which is , I suppose , : its original home .

		Or perhaps he read -LRB- and amplified -RRB- one of the accounts mentioned above , i But it seems difficult to deny that
Browning	PERSON	took hints from him .

		Merimee 's story was published in

Browning	PERSON	's poem appeared in

		A DISAVOWAL AND A PKOTEST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Li the issue of THE DIAL for
August 15	DATE	there is a communication from Mr.
H. E. Warner	PERSON	in j which he quotes from my article in the
April	DATE	, ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' several lines of verse beginning , `` I will arise , '' and follows my assumption in the article that these lines are free verse .

		I wish to i disavow that understanding of them .

		How they came to be so interpreted in the article would be too long to tell , and of too little general interest ; i but they were written as blank verse of a transi - tional sort , being part of a long poem .

		No long ' poem can be or should be continuously at a high level .

		If these lines are `` just prose , '' they are I so in the way of and under the conditions of a great deal of the blank-verse prose of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		This much seems rather called for as a matter of i keeping the record straight , a thing of some j moment in the present tangle of our literary I affairs .

		In spite of my very thorough disbelief in the !

		imagists , one comment I feel inclined to add here : ' In the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' for
September 2	DATE	,
Miss Amy Lowell	ORGANIZATION	levels a long-deserved blow at the pronunciation wynde for our common wind .

		This has been one of my greatest detestations .

		Some - how it has settled itself in my mind as the symbol of all the artificialities that to some minds make up poetry .

		Singers are the greatest offenders .

		PSYCHOLOGY AND FREE VEESE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his condemnation of free verse in THE DIAL of
August 15	DATE	, Mr.
Warner	PERSON	bases his argument upon what appears to me inaccurate psychology .

		His fundamental statement is : `` The sounds -LSB- of poetry -RSB- are addressed to the ear only ; the mean - ings , through the ear , to mind and heart .

		The eye has nothing to do with either .

		In written language the eye interprets the sound symbols , nothing more . ''

		We can all follow Mr.
Warner	PERSON	as far as spoken poetry is concerned .

		We can even agree with him regarding written poetry when it is read , as all `` regular verse '' is intended to be read , slowly and half aloud .

		But when written language is not read this way , what becomes of the argument ?

		It is certain enough that up to the advent of the modern magazines written language was read by almost everyone in this slow , half-vocal fash - ion .

		And upon this custom of reading , it seems to me , all the elaborate structure of poetical tech - nique has been built .

		But an educated person reads that way no longer .

		A vast amount of read - ing has so trained his eye and modified its connec - tion to the brain that it fairly flits along the lines , picking up the meaning without hardly becoming conscious of the words in which it is expressed .

		Such a reader reads for the thought and feeling content , not for the artistry of expression .

		Most `` regular verse '' is wearyingly slow to him ; it is not direct ; it clothes its thought with trivial con - ceit and expresses it with shallow artifice .

		For such readers free verse is intended .

		It is not so much to be `` read '' as it is to be `` grasped . ''

		Knowing that it will be seized upon practically a line at a time , the author makes such line divi - sions as will cause his idea to strike home with the maximum emotional effect .

		His aim is to convey an emotionalized idea ; if his medium serves the purpose perfectly by every principle of art , it is the correct one .

		Such , it seems to me , is in part at least the analysis of the case of free verse .

		I do not claim it to be the final one ; but I insist that if there is to be any conclusion of the question it must be arrived at through psychology and not through any marshalling or remarshalling of the stock opinions we are all familiar with .

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	A PROPHET LOOKS BACKWARD .

		*
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	`` found '' himself , he tells us -LRB- oddly enough , `` without knowing where I was '' -RRB- `` in the middle of that strange period of human evolution , the Victorian Age , which in some respects , one now thinks , marked the lowest ebb of modern civilized society , '' a period in which not only commercialism in public life , but cant in religion , pure materialism in science , futility in social conventions , the worship of stocks and shares , the starving of the human heart , the denial of the human body and its needs , the huddling concealment of the body in clothes , the `` impure hush '' on matters of sex , class-division , contempt of manual labor , and the cruel barring of women from every natural and useful expression of their lives , were carried to an extremity of folly difficult for us now to realize .

		Born into this Tinspeakable age ,
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	himself , of course , had none of its weaknesses ; one will look in vain in his life , as in his writings , for commercialism , con - ventions , and the impure hush ; instead , one finds the undiluted soulfulness of a very interesting type of rebel , pseudo-mystic , and bearded , sandalled prophet .

		Having outlived the Victorian age , he finds himself perhaps still without knowing where he is in the far more estimable twentieth century ; but so rapidly does the time-spirit change , that he already feels some concern lest he have the stamp of the past on him .

		`` In
' 96	DATE	, '' he says , `` no ` respectable ' publisher would touch ` Love 's Coming-of-Age , ' and yet to-day -LRB-
1915	DATE	-RRB- the tide of such literature has flowed so full and fast that my book has already become quite a little old-fashioned and demure ! ''

		The
Brighton	LOCATION	parade and the title-tattle of drawing-rooms , `` the would-be fashion - able world which I hated , '' together with the sea and the downs , formed the environ - ment of his boyhood and youth .

		No doubt he was happier and more nearly at home than he supposed on looking backward from the vantage ground of seventy : even a born rebel and weaver of dreams is for some years also a child .

		Much he accepted with joy even the vision of a meek young curate , `` probably of feeble mind , '' whom he envied with the fervor of a boy of fourteen , `` Oh , happy Mr.
Cass	PERSON	, if only I could be like you when I grow up . ''

		At about this time he began to form an intention of entering the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and in his piety reached the decision that , * MY DAYS AND DREAMS .

		By
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		in the event of fire breaking out in the house , he would save first his prayer-book .

		He was naturally dreamy , given to formless brood - ing , as , in lower degree , his father had been .

		Apparently his father was Victorian in his family relations and enlightened in the pri - vacy of his thoughts a `` respectable rentier '' with `` a kind of Broad Church mys - ticism '' that melted , under the influence of German philosophy , into `` a religious and philosophic mysticism without much admix - ture of the
Broad Church	ORGANIZATION	at all . ''

		Not with - out vividness is the following domestic picture : Of an
evening	TIME	, after dinner or supper , how we sat round the drawing-room table , or in scattered chairs , reading .

		My father would get out his Fichte or his
Hartmann	PERSON	and soon become lost in their pe - rusal .

		Occasionally he would , when he came to a striking passage , play a sort of devil 's tattoo with his fingers on the table , or , getting up , would walk to and fro quarterdeck fashion , with creaky boots , and reciting his authors to himself .

		Then my mother or perhaps my eldest sister would remonstrate , and after a time he would settle down again .

		Sometimes if he was very quiet one might look up from one 's book and see from his upturned eyes and half - open lips that he had lapsed into inner communion and meditation .

		Meanwhile , `` My mother sat on a low chair , with a book on her knee and some knitting in her hands , but occasionally , tired with the work of the day , would drop asleep . ''

		A more active strain was brought into the family by this mother , practical , prompt , `` with a kingly sense of duty and courage . ''

		Of the nine children , some were , like
Edward	PERSON	, imaginative and brooding , others active and adventurous e. g. , his brother
Charlie	PERSON	, who was first in everything -LRB- whether classics or cricket -RRB- in college , and a fine specimen of the young Englishman in
Indian Service	ORGANIZATION	, and his younger brother
Alfred	PERSON	, who at fourteen entered the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and began to make abund - ant use of his `` dare-devil temperament . ''

		Like his brothers ,
Edward	PERSON	was trained for the
University	ORGANIZATION	at the
Brighton College	ORGANIZATION	, save for a year at a lycee in
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		The methodical routine of schooling was hardly to his taste .

		At the lycee , `` The games were limited and regulated .

		Everything was regu - lated .

		It was said that the Minister of Edu - cation at
Paris	LOCATION	could at any hour of the day place his finger on the line of
Virgil	PERSON	that was being translated , or the proposition of Geom - etry that was being proved at that moment in all the Lycees alike over the face of the land . ''

		One can readily believe that the bounding , multitudinous instincts of the boy revolted against this type of monotony , as , at home , they revolted against social decorum .

		The influence of music counted for not a little in these years .

		He longed to learn to play
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 183 the piano ; but alas , as he lived in
Victorian England	LOCATION	, he must yield place to six dear sis - ters , `` who had to be taught , poor things , whether they liked it or not . ''

		Nevertheless , he contrived to tutor himself by playing late in the
evening	TIME	, when the rest of the family had withdrawn upstairs ; and with some help from his mother , he was at length ready even for
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's Sonatas .

		The hour of prac - tice at the piano was for a long time one of the chief events of his day .

		Later , he tried to compose music , before he had written any verse .

		But his chief refuge from his social environment was nature .

		Since the family lived within two hundred yards of the surge , the influence of the sea on the impressionable boy was ever active .

		Still more important was the influence of the downs .

		`` On sunny days I would wander on over them for miles , not knowing very clearly where I was going in a strange broody moony state glad to find some hollow -LRB- like that described in
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	' Story of My Heart -RCB- where one could lie secluded for any length of time and see only the clouds and grasses and an occa - sional butterfly . ''

		What a cheerful , gentle companion , these pale , chalky , blue-green downs bathed in sunshine bringing peace , and tranquil thought , and balm for all wounds !

		Before going to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, the boy attended school for a time in
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and here once more nature drew him to her .

		`` What I chiefly remember ... is those long moony rambles through the woods not very clearly thinking about anything that I can make out , but wondering , and just wait - ing and every now and then chancing in some secluded glade or gorgeous sunset scene upon something that caught my breath and held me still . ''

		Then , at last , to *
Trinity HaU	ORGANIZATION	.

		A curious mode of life awaited him here curious , that is , not to an American of this day , but to a moony mystic : The whole College was given up to boating .

		Not to row or help in the rowing in some way or other was rank apostasy .

		A few might read besides , and a few a dozen or two at most did so .

		I boated and talked boating slang ; was made stroke of the second boat , and it went down several places ; became Secretary of the Boat Club ; and for two years wore out the seat of my breeches and the cuticle beneath with incessant aquatic service .

		That is almost as strange a phenomenon as
Francis Thompson	PERSON	devouring cricket scores .

		Of his studies , mathematics interested him most ; indeed , for three years mathematics `` nearly entirely absorbed '' his energy as a student .

		That energy , however , was not cen - tral in his life .

		As before , he lived mainly in himself , and in those fleeting glimpses of him - self that outer nature yielded .

		How much of the wild romantic heart of youth is there in these sentences and stanzas : How well I remember going down , as I so fre - quently did , alone to the riverside at night , amid the hushed reserve and quiet grace of the old College gardens , and pouring my little soul out to the silent trees and clouds and waters !

		I do n't know what kind of longing it was something partly sexual , partly religious , and both , owing to my strangely slow-growing temperament , still very obscure and undefined ; but anyhow it was something that brooded about and enveloped my life , and makes those hours still stand out for me as the most pregnant of my then existence ... O hanging cloud , O scarcely stirring trees , O velvet waters moved to sound By the gliding fishes ' bound , O willow , whispering to the fitful breeze , gentle touch of the sweet
summer	DATE	air , O solitary owl , alone , Nursing thy joy in low weird tone Within thy leafy lair !

		O one and all , unveil !

		and let us see The naming soul of world-wide Love Burning behind you , far above , Beneath , deep-fountained life , strange mystery !

		Unveil !

		O night that washest Earth 's dark shore , O suns , through space that ever roll , O Love , clasping us body and soul For evermore !

		What
Carpenter	PERSON	was really moving toward , one can readily see , is the radical chanting of `` Towards Democracy '' ; what he was super - ficially approaching is the priesthood .

		In
June , 1869	DATE	, he was ordained Deacon by the
Bishop of Ely	ORGANIZATION	: an odd fact in his biography , to be regarded not as an expression of his essential nature , but rather as his most strik - ing concession to the Zeitgeist .

		The next year he was ordained priest .

		He became uneasy , moved from his moorings without knowing it , found himself in an ever more false posi - tion , and in
1871	DATE	, taking advantage of an ill - ness , he cut himself free .

		Meanwhile more genuine ties were forming .

		Carpenter 's significant literary enthusiasms came late in his youth : first
Wordsworth	PERSON	, then
Shelley	PERSON	-LRB- more truly akin to him -RRB- , finally Whitman -LRB- his prototype -RRB- .

		It was in the
summer of ' 68	DATE	... that one day
H. D. Warr	PERSON	one of the
Fellows of Trinity HaU	ORGANIZATION	, and a very brilliant and amusing man came into my room with a blue-covered book in his hands ,
William Rossetti	PERSON	's edition of Whitman 's poems only lately published , and said : ``
Carpenter	PERSON	, what do you think of this ! ''

		I took it from him , looked at it , was puzzled , and asked him what he thought of it .

		`` Well , '' he said , `` I thought a good deal of it at first , but I don ' t think I can stand any more of it . ''

		With those words he left me ; and I remember lying down then and there on the floor and for half an hour poring , pausing , wondering .

		I could not make the book out , but I knew at the end of that time that I intended to go on reading it .

		In a short time I bought a copy for myself , then I got Demo - THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	cratic Vistas , and later on , after three or four years , Leaves of Grass complete .

		From that time forward a profound change set in within me .

		I remember the long and beautiful
summer	DATE	nights , sometimes in the college garden by the riverside , sometimes sitting at my own window which itself overlooked a little old-fashioned garden enclosed by grey and crumbling walls ; sometimes watching the silent and untroubled dawn ; and feel - ing all the time that my life deep down was flowing out and away from the surroundings and traditions amid which I lived a current of sympathy carrying it westward , across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		I wrote to
Whitman	LOCATION	, obtained his books from him , and occasional post - cardial responses .

		But outwardly , and on the sur - face , my life went on as usual .

		What drew him to
Whitman	PERSON	was first of all his celebration of comradeship .

		That chimed , in the physical form it took in
Whitman	LOCATION	, with his own predilections , for underneath his aversion to life as it is lived had been a long - ing for a rough-and-ready , arm-in-arm cam - erado relationship with a few kindred spirits .

		Then , the frank sensuality of Whitman exem - plified his own early convictions as to the Tightness of openness and the wrongness of lies and indirections and shams .

		These con - victions were corroborated , he thought , by Greek sculpture , with which he became acquainted in
Italy	LOCATION	in
1873	DATE	.

		The result of these influences , and of his development in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	years , was a second `` unfrocking . ''

		As he had abandoned the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, so he now abandoned the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and , responding to a sudden inspiration , decided to `` go and make my life with the mass of the people and the manual workers . ''

		This brings us to the end of the first period of his life .

		Of his more familiar later activi - ties his goings up and down as a distraught University Extension lecturer , his market gardening at
Bradway	PERSON	-LRB- immediately follow - ing his inheritance of 6000 -RRB- , his `` simple life '' at
Millthorpe	LOCATION	, where he received every manner of crotchety guest and looked out upon the world with disdain but also with large hope nothing need be said here , the most valuable part of the book being the story of his early years .

		A few titles drawn from the list of his works contained in the appen - dix will suggest something of the range of his interests : `` Homogenic Love and Its Place in a Free Society , '' `` Vivisection , '' `` Non-Governmental Society , '' `` The Inner Self , '' `` Proof of
Taylor	ORGANIZATION	's Theorem in the Differential Calculus , '' `` The Smoke-Nuisance and its Eemedy , '' `` On English Hexameter Verse . ''

		Of the countless personalities that pass before the reader of these reminiscences , many are well-nigh unforgettable in their various eccentricities and more or less genial aberrations ; but few great names appear .

		Here is one who was both eccentric and great through borrowed light
Trelawny	LOCATION	of the `` Eecords '' : A quite old man of about eighty-seven or eighty - eight , rugged to a degree , with sunken eyes and pro- jecting cheek-bones , but with a strange gleam of fire about him even at that age not unlike some semi-extinct volcano and the appearance of what had once been a rather massive and powerful frame .

		He was sitting in a high chair near the fire with a pile of books on the floor beside him .

		`` You are interested in
Shelley	LOCATION	, '' he said .

		And then without waiting for a reply : `` He was our greatest poet since Shakespeare . ''

		And then : `` He could n't have been the poet he was if he had not been an Atheist . ''

		That was a pretty good beginning ; he rolled out the '' Atheist '' with evident satisfaction .

		Presently he points out an oil-portrait of Mary : `` She did him no good , '' he said `` was always a drag on him '' ... `` Poets , '' he continued , `` ought never to marry .

		It 's the greatest mistake .

		A poet ought to be as free as air free to say and do what he pleases and he can not be free if he is married . ''

		And
Trelawny	LOCATION	himself , as
Carpenter	PERSON	goes on to say , `` had four wives at least no one knew how many more ! ''

		In
America	LOCATION	,
Carpenter	PERSON	met , among others , our foremost writer , of whom we are given this pen portrait :
Emerson	PERSON	was very charming and friendly ... His eyes greyish-blue , the corners of his lips often drawn upward altogether a wonderful bird-like look about his face , enhanced by his way of jerk - ing his head forward the look sometimes very straight and intense , then followed by a charming placid smile like moonlight on the sea .

		His domes - tic life seemed admirable .

		In his library he talked much about books and authors handling his books in a caressing loving way ... He expressed his admiration for
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	; his want of the same for
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; and his plain con - tempt of
Lewes	LOCATION	' Life of Goethe ... When I spoke of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	he made an odd whinnying sound : `` Well , I thought he had some merit at one time : there was a good deal of promise in the first edition burt he is a wayward fanciful man .

		I saw him in
New York	LOCATION	and asked him to dine at my Hotel .

		He shouted for a ` tin mug ' for his beer .

		Then he had a noisy fire engine society .

		And he took me there and was like a boy over it , as if there had never been such a thing before . ''

		Characteristically ,
Carpenter	PERSON	crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as a steerage passenger this was in
1884	DATE	and so relished the experience that he repeated it on the return voyage .

		`` The fact of my venturing it , '' he says , `` shows the determination with which I was working down into a knowledge of the life of the
NORMAN FOERSTER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Alfred A. Knopf	PERSON	has arranged to bring out an English version of
Alexander Benois	PERSON	's famous work , `` The Russian School of Painting . ''

		Mr.
Christian Brinton	PERSON	will furnish an introduction in appreciation of
Benois	PERSON	and his work .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 185 Tm : AMERICAN CITY .

		* In
1909	DATE	Professor
William B. Munro	PERSON	pub - lished a volume entitled `` The Government of European Cities , '' and in
1913	DATE	another entitled `` The Government of American Cities . ''

		Both books dealt with the frame - work of city government , and made no pre - tense of covering the broad subject commonly designated `` municipal functions . ''

		The pur - pose was to reserve this portion of the subject for separate treatment ; and in the recently published volume , `` The Principles and Methods of
Municipal Administration	ORGANIZATION	, '' this purpose has been achieved .

		The aim of the new volume , in the author 's words , is `` to show how various city depart - ments are organized , what work they have to do , and what problems they usually encounter in getting things done . ''

		It would be difficult to imagine a book which , within the limits set , should more completely attain this aim .

		In the first place , the author avoids the mis - take of attempting to cover within five hun - dred pages every portion of the limitless field of municipal administration .

		He writes in considerable detail of city planning and street arrangement , of water supply and lighting , of waste disposal and sewerage , of police administration , and fire prevention and pro- tection , of school administration , and of finance .

		But he does not cover health admin - istration , building regulation in relation to housing , charities and corrections , street rail - ways , subways , ferries , docks , markets , and other of the important functions and utilities of the city .

		He omits from the present volume topics sufficient to fill a companion volume , such as it may he hoped that he eventually will write .

		Professor
Munro	PERSON	attains his purpose , in the second place , because he has mastered his sub - ject and is able to write with unimpeachable authority .

		The literature is abundant , but the documents are in many respects defective , and it has been no ordinary task to arrive at authenticated facts and demonstrable conclu - sions .

		Prolonged investigation of the written materials , re-enforced by personal observa - tion and by consultation with leading stu - dents in the field , has yielded results of exceptionally satisfactory character .

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurfr & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		must be mentioned the fact that the author has imparted to his discussions substantial literary quality .

		Accuracy and readableness are happily combined .

		No book in which it is proposed to describe the administration of municipal affairs in recent decades and at the present day can fail to be largely a chronicle of shortcomings .

		The most striking fact about Professor
Munro	PERSON	's volume , none the less , is the tone of optimism with which it is pervaded .

		`` American cities , '' we are told at the outset , `` have made more progress in the direction of clean and efficient government within the
last ten years	DATE	than they were able to make during the preceding fifty . ''

		And a careful reading of the record of administrative advance as set down in the succeeding chapters leads inevi - tably to concurrence in the assertion .

		In the judgment of the author , the two features of municipal development in the past decade to which , mainly , is attributable the improve - ment that has taken place are the `` radical simplification of governing machinery '' and the `` progress of the efficiency movement , so - called , involving the use of new administra - tive implements and the adoption of improved business methods . ''

		Another development which , he says , promises to be at once the culmination of these reforms and the guaran - tee of their permanence is the `` spread of more accurate popular knowledge concerning the city 's affairs . ''

		And in this connection whole - some stress is laid upon the fact that , while technical expertness in administration is to be desired , the exponents of `` efficiency '' in late years have overshot the mark by encouraging the people to believe that municipal affairs are too abstruse to be understood or deter - mined by them .

		The fundamental requisite of wholesome municipal government , it is insisted , is intelligent citizenship , `` an interested and informed community . ''

		The form of the government is important , but if the public attitude is right satisfactory results can be attained under any structural arrange - ments .

		And while the personnel of the munic - ipal official body is important , it may be depended upon to be acceptable if only the people have an enlightened interest in their public affairs .

		The methods of educating the public in municipal matters are discussed succinctly , and it is affirmed that a main object of the chapters which make up the body of the book is `` to translate many so - termed complicated questions into ordinary language , to show that most matters of muni - cipal administration resolve themselves into broad questions of principles or method which any ordinary mind can grasp . ''

		186 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	One of the most suggestive of Professor
Munro	PERSON	's chapters deals with city planning .

		And within a year there have been published several volumes devoted exclusively to this new and fascinating subject .

		Two of the best of these are Mr.
C. M. Robinson	PERSON	's `` City Planning '' and Mr.
John Nolen	PERSON	's `` City Planning . ''

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's volume is a revi - sion of a book entitled `` The Width and Arrangement of Streets , '' published in
1911	DATE	.

		It contains , however , a large amount of mat - ter that is new , notably a series of five chap - ters on city-planning legislation , a phase of the subject on which little indeed could be written even so recently as
1911	DATE	.

		As its sub - title suggests , the book discusses mainly the planning of streets and lots , and considers only incidentally the subject of parks .

		But so far as it goes it covers the ground very satisfactorily .

		The text is simple , and the numerous illustrations lend vividness .

		No stronger argument for scientific planning of street construction , in accordance with the interests of property owners and of the muni - pality as well , has been made .

		The volume edited by Mr.
Nolen	PERSON	appears in a series published under the authority of the
National Municipal League	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is correctly denominated a handbook , and there has been no attempt to expand it into a comprehensive treatise .

		It contains chapters by sixteen writers , although , as the editor justly affirms , it is not merely a loose collection of essays on city planning subjects , but rather a related series which , taken together , covers the essen - tial elements of a city plan .

		The contributors are men of recognized qualifications , and most of them have technical knowledge of , and experience in , the portion of the field upon which they have written .

		Among them are
Frederick Law Olmsted	ORGANIZATION	,
Arthur A. Shurtleff	PERSON	,
George R. Wadsworth	PERSON	,
James Ford	PERSON	,
J. Horace McFarland	PERSON	, and
Charles M. Robinson	PERSON	.

		The subject of street arrangement is covered less thoroughly than in Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's volume .

		But on the other hand there are chapters on park systems , recreation facilities , water supply in relation to the city plan , railroads and industrial districts , the effect of rapid transit on the city plan , and the finances of city planning .

		There are serviceable chapter bibliographies and helpful diagrams and illustrations .

		Altogether , the volume is more generally useful , for Americans at all events , than any other upon the subject .

		Mr.
Henry C. Wright	PERSON	's `` The American City '' is essentially a primer , designed to afford a bird 's - eye view of municipal govern - ment and municipal activities in this country .

		It would not be expected that a book of the kind should contain new facts , and the high - est qualities that could reasonably be looked for are accuracy and proportion .

		On both of these scores Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's little volume must be pronounced satisfactory .

		The lay - man will find it a serviceable introduction to the subject of which it treats .

AUSTIN OGG	PERSON	.

		LIGHT ON A DARK PROBLEM .

		* In these days of easy superlatives much is said of the epoch-making event .

		`` Society and `` Prisons '' can not be called an epoch-mak - ing book ; but in the field of prison reform Mr.
Thomas Mott Osborne	PERSON	is not far from being an epoch-making man .

		This conclusion , at any rate , is left with one who reads his latest book .

		Though Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	was an expert in prison matters before certain malign powers forced him out of the wardenship of Sing Sing , he has now the advantage of a national reputation .

		This he needs , and society also , in order to give a wide currency to his beliefs .

		The present book , appearing fortunately at the time of his reinstatement as Warden of Sing Sing , is therefore a peculiarly happy event in the development of prison reform .

		Invited to give the
Dodge Lectures	ORGANIZATION	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1915	DATE	, Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	seized the opportunity to present his mature views not only to his hearers , but also to the general public .

		The eight lectures published in the present vol - ume thus form an admirable text-book on prisons and punishment .

		From the beginning , Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	contends that the prisoner must be studied as an indi - vidual , and treated according to his character , if not before at least after incarceration .

		To class criminals as first offenders or recidiv - ists , as long termers or short termers , is as sensible as dividing them according to stature or color of hair .

		Each prisoner is a man , however marred , and each has his peculiar temperament .

		There can be no classification .

		If the judge can not learn to know the man as a man and often he can not , the war - den of the prison must learn to know him so .

		And when the prisoner has won by his conduct the right to freedom he should have it .

		In other words , the indeterminate sen - tence , in Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	's opinion , is a funda - mental necessity in prison reform .

		In this connection , Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	denies the existence of the `` hardened criminal . ''

		No criminal is hopeless unless insane , and then he is sick * SOCIETY AND PRISONS .

		By
Thomas Mott Osborne	PERSON	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 187 and should be treated as a sick man .

		Lombroso 's `` criminal type '' has no place in Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	's philosophy ; and he shows a grim satisfaction in paying hisr respects to Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, whose book entitled `` The I Criminal '' transmits to the English and i American public many of the theories of the !

		celebrated Italian .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	has discovered or was it Lombroso himself !

		that `` among the characteristics of criminals is a love of animals and pets , '' and also that `` family affection is by no means rare among crimi - nals , '' `` One is tempted to add , '' remarks Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	, `` as a no less important contri - bution to penology , that criminals , as a rule , have two legs , and are sometimes partial to chops and tomato sauce . ''

		Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	in his long experience has known so many men who might have been in prison but are now suc - cessful , and so many others who might have been successful but who got caught and were later ruined in prison , that he frankly won - ders what a criminal is .

		Take the case of `` Jimmy D. , '' who as office boy used to filch small sums from the pay envelopes of the men .

		He was discovered and discharged .

		Long afterward Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	was addressed in a theatre by a well-dressed man who said he was ``
Jimmy D.	PERSON	, '' and who gave a very good account of himself .

		`` Had I met him in Sing Sing , '' says Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	, `` I should have been less surprised , for
thirty years ago	DATE	if there ever was a mischievous little devil , he was it . ''

		The fundamental disagreement between Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	and the old order of criminologists lies in point of view .

		Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	believes that prisons should exist not for punishment but for reform .

		Why should society wreak | its vengeance upon a man who has injured it , only to set him free after a few years , bitter : and hopeless , and resolved to have revenge in I his turn ?

		Yet there is no question that j society , through its present laws , intends to send the criminal to prison for punishment , j This attitude of mind has of course survived j from the past .

		The forces of order resent j violence , and proceed to deprive the violent of liberty and happiness .

		Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	would pursue a different course , which he presents i in the following imaginary charge of a judge : to a convicted man : Friend and brother , it has been determined by an unprejudiced tribunal of your fellowmen that you have done this thing .

		As for your intentions , we do not presume to judge ; as for your motives , they can be known only to yourself and God ; as for your act , it makes no difference what it was , so long as it is dangerous to society .

		You are an impediment to its onward march ; you are out of gear with its intricate machinery .

		Your relations with God we leave with God , for we neither grade your crime nor brand any man as a criminal .

		Your relation with society , society has a right to regulate ; and society decrees that you remain in exile from it until you have shown by your conduct that you are fit to return to it .

		Every help will be given you , every incentive will be offered you , to learn your lesson .

		Then when you have learned it , be that time long or short , society will welcome you back again in its midst .

		It will not turn its back upon you because your very return will show that you have worked out your own salvation , that from the bitterness of experience you have learned the truth you would not or could not learn without it .

		Friend and brother , until that time comes , farewell and may God go with you .

		Sincerity characterizes the book through - out .

		One can hear Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	's voice ring when he describes old prison systems with their stupid cruelties , the most frightful of which is solitary confinement ; when he retells the story of his week in
Auburn Prison	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- described in detail in an earlier book , `` Within Prison Walls '' -RRB- ; and in his fervent support of the Honor System , tried out so successfully in
Auburn	LOCATION	and Sing Sing .

		The
Mutual Welfare League	ORGANIZATION	, the agent of self - government in these prisons , has placed responsibility on the men , won them new privileges , brought them health , and given them hope .

		It 's motto , `` Do good Make good , '' has inspired in the prisoners a new desire to make something of their broken lives , and in that Mr.
Osborne	PERSON	sees the sure promise of a better day for prisons and society .

		MASY ASPECTS OF THE WAR .

		* In one of Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's speeches , re - printed in the volume before us , occurs a passage which gave so much pain to a mother of soldiers that she wrote to `` The Pall Mall Gazette '' in protest .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	refers to this in a footnote , and wonders why she should have objected .

		We do not wonder ; we wonder rather that the author should be so little aware of his lapses into the super - ficial frivolity of the journalistic method , so wholly unconscious of a certain discrepancy between his literary style and his entirely serious purpose .

		Such discrepancies are com - mon enough in the English literature of to - day , and Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	is by no means one of the most extreme examples .

		The skill expended on these efforts to catch the ear of a more or less trifling public will scarcely create a permanently valuable form of lit - erary art , but the thoughts expressed may yet * THE WAK FOB THE WORLD .

		By
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		188 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	find an important place in the history of progress .

		Thus , though Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's new book is a collection of not altogether contemporary miscellanea ; though the style is largely that of ephemeral writings ; nevertheless , we have before us the reactions of an extremely keen and sagacious observer , who is entirely in earnest and essentially in advance of his time .

		Perhaps the key to his whole position is best found in the charming essay `` Paradise Lost , '' extracted from `` King
Albert	PERSON	's Book . ''

		It begins with a picture of the British fleet guarding the
North Sea	LOCATION	, the constant vigi - lance , the chances of instant death .

		The men have sent home most of their property ; there is little on board which is not designed for the uses of war .

		Yet in the midst of all this a young officer is found with a book , reading in the intervals of his duties , `` Paradise Lost '' !

		Taking this as typical , Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	continues : Now , whatever be the rights or wrongs of war , one thing seems clear .

		The weapons are wrong .

		My young friend , with his fine-spun brain and his spiritxial delight in
Milton	LOCATION	's harmonics , ought not to be annihilated by a piece of raw matter .

		One does not fight a Sevres vase with a stone ... No , if fighting there must be let my young friend fight against Nietzsche-worshippers let the lucid lines of the Puritan poet confound the formless squadrons of the Pagan dithyrambist .

		Brain against brain , soul against soul , thought against thought , art against art , man , in short , against man there lies the fight of the future .

		If my young friend were a man of science , he would be kept awake not by the German torpedoes but by the German treatises ; were he only a tailor , he should never throw away his yard-stick for a lance but with his good old scissors cut out the Teutonic tailor .

		Such a fight has indeed long been in progress , and the Germans have won many well - deserved victories .

		Why , then , should they `` challenge the world on the lower plane of brute matter '' ?

		Why was it not sufficient to conquer by civilized means ?

		`` Fatal perver - sity of
Germany	LOCATION	to have misunderstood her own greatness !

		Proud in her pseudo - philosophy , she has repeated ` man 's first dis - obedience ' she has ignored the divine voice , she has listened to the lower promptings of the serpent . ''

		In another chapter , however , we are asked to consider
Germany	LOCATION	's commercial and polit - ical efficiency ; and the question is raised , whether it is worth while to enter into compe - tition on her basis : A professor of chemistry at a great provincial university announced a lecture -LRB- during the war -RRB- on `` How to Capture the German Dye-Trade '' !


Charlie Chaplin	PERSON	himself could not have drawn a more numerous or eager audience .

		`` First of all , '' he began , and every ear was pricked up , and every eye glistened , `` no week-ends ! ''

		The faces fell .

		A dim presenti - ment that German trade was capturing them chilled the ardent assembly .

		In point of fact , what did it mean , that
Germany	LOCATION	was `` dumping '' goods on Eng - land ?

		That in her cousinly devotion to the interests of our masses she was toiling night and day to supply them with commodities as cheaply as possible .

		Poor patient , drudging Teuton !

		Pitiful helot , bearing our British burdens !

		We did not want to be a nest of ants with a slave-colony .

		But if Germans ever , ever , ever , will be slaves what is to be done ?

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	pleads eloquently for the attempt to shorten the war by beginning nego - tiations looking toward peace .

		He quotes
Bloch	PERSON	and recent experience in favor of the view that no decision or final military out - come is to be expected .

		Thus eventually it must be a matter of negotiations , and why not begin now ?

		Is there so much to gain in a military sense that it will pay for the enormous suffering and loss going on in the meantime ?

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	has no sympathy with the unconditional Pacifist , who is `` a shirker not of military duty but of unpleasant facts , '' but he finds what he calls the `` Mili - tary Pacifists '' even less bearable .

		Their notion of ending war by wiping out
Germany	LOCATION	is the most dangerous form of homicidal mania now endemic ... As a rule , Utopians do no harm , if little good .

		But in chasing the mirage of a
Germany	LOCATION	in ruins , they may work woeful mischief to
England	LOCATION	, setting her fortunes , as they do , on the fall of a single die , and declaring , as they do , that nothing matters not even bankruptcy so long as the pur - sual of their Will-o ' - the-Wisp is unrelaxed .

		In a chapter on `` Novelists and the War , '' we are reminded that the novelist is , after all , a `` professor of human nature , '' and as such may have useful things to say on public affairs .

		`` To the novelist human and unashamed the strategy of war is not so fascinating as its psychology , as its patholog - ical problems . ''

		Better than many others , he understands the mysteries of double person - ality , and the effects of circumstances on the mind .

		So , says Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	, the emergence of the `` hyphenated '' in
America	LOCATION	is no more proof of the failure of the fusive process which is making an American nation , than sea-sickness is a proof of the unreality of digestion .

		So again in actual war : `` as the deadly poison-gas of the Germans may be got by decomposing common salt , so the common man may be decomposed into a demon .

		But he returns gladly to his simple table self . ''

		Under conditions of war , the judgment is warped , and lies pass current for truth ; it even becomes unpatriotic to attempt to be just : This is the true '' fog of war '' that we no longer see each other , that we hack blindly in the dark at the monstrous images we have made of each other .

		The German crimes are largely the outcome of an inhuman logic pushed to extremes by panic fear ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 189 and the bulk of the Germans are no more responsible for them than you or I for the deaths in the
Darda	LOCATION	- nelles .

		When we last caught sight of their faces on Christmas Eve in the trenches what was there but the lineaments of our common , our poor , pitiful humanity ?

		Four chapters are devoted to the woman question , and the latter part of the book contains a very illuminating discussion of the Jewish people , particularly in relation to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		As to the first : `` Not only has female militancy ceased it has been replaced , as we have seen , by female service , service so devoted , so multifarious , so self-sacrificing and so heroic as to make any further denial of equal footing as futile as it would be ungrate - ful ... Everywhere , you see , the distinc - tion between the sexes is being reduced to its proper sphere which is with few exceptions the sphere of privacy .

		Sex 's place is the home . ''

		The Jewish problem is presented as one which is especially , at this time , the con - cern of
England	LOCATION	.

		The treatment of the Jews in
Russia	LOCATION	remains abominable , in spite of the fact that they have fought so well in the war .

		England , now allied with
Russia	LOCATION	, has some right to demand better things , as we all thought the Germans should nave demanded of the Turks in
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		The Jews indeed have not been the only sufferers , and natur - ally the liberals of
Russia	LOCATION	looked for aid to the liberal sentiment of
England	LOCATION	.

		`` What will they say in liberty-loving England ? ''

		exclaimed a speaker in the
Duma	LOCATION	.

		But alas !

		in
England	LOCATION	they had little or nothing to say , at any rate officially .

		Our first impression of a certain undue lightness of treatment vanishes as we absorb the contents of this many-sided book , not that it was altogether mistaken , but because we forget it in our interest in the great ques - tions discussed and the sincerity and ability shown in the treatment .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Addressed to members of the
Anglican Church	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	as well as to all American Christians , be they professional Churchmen or not , Rev.
Wm. A. R. Goodwin	PERSON	's `` The Church Enchained '' -LRB- Button -RRB- is an eloquent and worthy effort to arouse Christians to the appalling crisis which faces them .

		What are the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's responsibil - ities , and what her labor to fulfill that high calling appointed unto herT If she be failing , why did she fail ?

		and how may she correct herself ?

		These are the immediate and necessary questions to be asked and answered by Christians everywhere .

		Additional weight is given to this appeal by reason of its introduction written by the Rt. .

New York	LOCATION	.

		WITH THE ALLIES .

		* It may be that years hence some Homer will write an epic on the retreat of the Serbian army in the year
1915	DATE	, or that a
Bennett	PERSON	will detail , in three volumes , the emotions of an individual refugee , but just now Mr.
Fortier Jones	PERSON	, an American , has recorded the impres - sions of an eye-witness to the actual happen - ing the rout of a nation .

		Or it may be , with the passing of years , that succeeding incidents and a broader perspective will arrange values to an extent preventive of epics , or even of trilogies .

		But the chances are that the event of which Mr.
Jones	PERSON	has written will always be considered one of the most tremendous catas - trophes in history .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	was with the retreating army from the
Danube	LOCATION	to the
Adriatic	LOCATION	, and in pow - erful terms he sets forth the tragedy of the flight .

		He tells of the sudden approach of defeat , of the cold and sleet and snow , of almost impassable roads blocked solid for miles with struggling men and women , with oxen and automobiles ; he tells of hunger and disease , of superb fighting spirit , of lack of ammunition , of adherence to an ideal .

		His narrative is one of striking contrasts , the heroic `` cheechas , '' feeble old men in the last line of reserve with empty stomachs and cheerful grins , and the boys not quite old enough for service , who were herded together and sent to the sea , which only a few ever reached , that they might be saved from the advancing Teutons and Bulgars for a `` to - morrow '' of vengeance .

		He presents single episodes that express the whole feeling of the nation , a soldier accidentally knocking an old woman into the snow and throwing down his own equipment that he might carry her , and the old woman cursing him and pointing to his gun .

		He tells of the unbecom - ing conduct of the British attaches , and the splendid fortitude of the British nurses whom he conducted throughout the greater part of the retreat .

		He speaks , also , of the over-adver - tised aid that the
United States	LOCATION	rendered during the typhus epidemic , and offers the statement that other nations , notably
Russia	LOCATION	, did more and said less .

		190 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	All these things he tells , and in simple , direct language .

		He seems to have realized the effectiveness of fact rather than its impres - siveness .

		For these things were stark facts to him , and if , because of this , he loses at times the writer 's self - consciousness , it is not to his discredit .

		And thereby does he present more convincingly the thought with which , as a prediction , he concludes the book : That the national soul of
Serbia	LOCATION	shall not die .

		Throughout the book the personal pronoun is suppressed , but it is easily seen what part Mr.
Jones	PERSON	played in the events which he nar - rates .

		And an interest attaches to the per - sonality of the writer because of the nature of those events .

		His decision to join the relief expedition and his departure within twenty - four hours hint at a mere impetuous eager - ness for adventure , but contact with raw , naked life may have played an important part in a development of character .

		For the quality of the thought shows plainly that he has caught much of the spirit of service .

		However that may be , it would certainly seem that the book is the honest writing of a gallant gentleman .

		Quite different in method is the `` Prisoner of War , '' by
Andre `` Warnod	PERSON	, a Parisian jour - nalist. , who was taken captive by the Germans and confined in a detention camp with thou - sands of other prisoners , Russians ,
Moroc	PERSON	- cans ,
Highlanders	ORGANIZATION	, Belgians .

		With what is obviously an intention of giving the `` home folks '' an accurate idea of existence in these surroundings , he has written of the living conditions of the camp , the attitude of Ger - man soldiers and civilians , and the spirit of the prisoners .

		He gives descriptions and sketches , in words and drawings , of the fea - tures of camp life , the concerts with instru - ments fashioned from boxes , the Christmas mass with its terrible depression , the theatre with scenery painted on sheets of paper , the prisoner-vendors of food and drink and trinkets , the fire drill .

		In everything he is the
Parisien	PERSON	and the artist .

		The wretchedness of the prisoners is emphasized when he tells of it in cheerful vein ; he sees the pictorial value , the color , in every incident of the life around him .

		He laughs at German `` thoroughness , '' which provides beds but no bedding , and stoves without coal ; he returns an indictment of tactlessness against the Germans as their worst sin !


Patrick MacGill	PERSON	, who wrote `` Children of the Dead End , '' `` The Rat Pit , '' and `` The Red Horizon , '' was with the Royal Irish at
Loos	PERSON	when the regiment kicked a football across the field to the German trenches , and this charge is the `` big scene '' in his book , `` The Great Push . ''

		At least one has the feel - ing that the book was written around this incident and the advertising tends to indi - cate it .

		It is a `` big scene , '' and thrilling and dra - matic and convincing , and all the other stock adjectives .

		But it is not as thrilling by half as the scene just before it , where the men are waiting to go `` over the top '' of the trenches , nor as dramatic as `` The Ration Party , '' nor as convincing as the episode of
Gilhooley	PERSON	, the Bomber .

		However , he draws interesting figures ,
Bill	PERSON	,
Teake	LOCATION	,
Pryor	PERSON	, Chaplain Lane -
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, M ` Crone , men whose traits of charac - ter in peace times show through in the most curious ways in the metamorphoses of war .

		These men , and the argot of the trenches , and such incidents as the stemming of a retreat and the picking up of the wounded are sketched with a good deal of skill .

		Alto - gether there is presented the very essence of the war , or as Bill would say , the smell of it .

		At times Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	comes dangerously close to the crime of `` fine writing , '' but most of the book was written on the scene of action , and the wonder of it is that he wrote as sim - ply as he did .

		After reading Mr.
Fortier Jones	PERSON	's account of the British nurses in the Serbian retreat , it is especially interesting to follow the adven - tures of a woman of the same stripe as those for whom he has so much admiration .

		Miss
S. MacNaughtan	PERSON	, a novelist , joined the Red Cross at the beginning of the war , went through the siege and evacuation of
Antwerp	LOCATION	, and was with her unit at Furnes and La ' Panne .

		Hers is the intimate view of the behind-the-lines phase of the war , the contact with suffering without the opportunity for counter-aggression .

		In attractively simple language she de - scribes the handling of the wounded and the cheerful persistence with which the nurses `` did their bit . ''

		There is not a little humor in the book and a great deal of earnestness .

		Surely a nation with the spirit of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's and Miss MacNaughtan 's women is uncon - querable .

		`` Sapper '' is an English officer of Engineers , and he has written a book called ``
Michael Cassidy	PERSON	, Sergeant . ''

		And
Michael Cassidy	PERSON	is not Kiplingesque .

		This , incredibly , despite the sub-title : '' ` Plain Tales ' of the Great War '' !


Michael Cassidy	PERSON	is in
London	LOCATION	, wounded , when the author reaches the city on his way to the front .

		In a number of short stories , more or less connected , he tells of what has befallen him .

		Later on
Michael	PERSON	disappears ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 191 and his place is taken by other characters , such as the `` nut '' who enlisted , and after his first shelling , found that there were other things besides cocktails and whisky sours and amusing women , and that a new force was at work the force of Death which made them all seem very petty .

		The ancestors seemed a bit petty , the money that came from tins seemed a bit petty ; he only remembered a head roll - ing toward him with gaping mouth and staring eyes .

		It struck him that his might have been the head .


Michael Cassidy	PERSON	is not astoundingly real , though he is quite a ladies ' man , and his dialect , with what one might call its procras - tinating verbs , and its inversions , is so deter - minedly Irish that it is almost German !

		But he is interesting , as are the other char - acters , and the stories `` grip , '' which , after all , is the final test .

		Very simply and modestly ,
Marcel Dupont	PERSON	, a lieutenant of Chasseurs , speaks of `` things I have seen with my own eyes , in the little corner of the battle-field occupied by my regi - j ment , '' in '' In the Field . ''

		By way of preface , he says : Further , I gladly offer these `` impressions '' to any non-combatants they may interest .

		They must not look for the talents of a great story-teller , nor the thrill - ing interest of a novel .

		All they will find is the simple tale of an eyewitness , the unschooled effort of a soldier more apt with the sword than with the pen .

		What `` they '' do find is some very effective work ; stories with a distinct charm , and a distinct , though unconscious , purpose .

		Be - cause he was with the cavalry arm
M. Dupont	ORGANIZATION	saw more of the ancient glory of war , at first , than would have been his fortune had he been in the trenches from the beginning ; but later on he came face to face with `` the other thing . ''

		The stories , `` Sister Gabrielle '' and `` The First Charge '' are particularly good .

		`` They '' who read are sure to glimpse somewhat of the spirit that makes for the wonderful relations between officer and man , the spirit that animates the French army and the French Kepublic .

		If they be American , `` They '' may perceive a quality to which our own Republic must attain if it is to survive .

		MR.
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	'S XEW CHRIST .

		* The little poems of
Barbara Erskine	PERSON	have been gathered together and printed in simple book form by
The Trow Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were found in note - books , tucked into volumes of poetry she had loved and read , and taken from letters to friends .

		The book contains 75 pages and is printed on French hand-made paper , with a full-page illustration in pen and ink by
Lewis E. Macomber	PERSON	, which is printed on vellum .

		Miss
Erskine	PERSON	was the daughter of
Elia W. Peattie	PERSON	, of the ``
Chicago	LOCATION	Tribune , '' a well-known writer of short stories .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's novel on the life of
Christ	LOCATION	, `` The Brook Kerith , '' could not have been published at a more appropriate time .

		One thing that the Great War has settled for good , though I fear many honest people are too stupid to recognize it , is that in the life of the modern world Christianity is like a best suit of clothes worn to please ourselves and impress the neighbors .

		The warring nations are each like a citizen who , strolling in his orchard on a
Sunday	DATE	, after meeting , has seen an armed foreigner getting through the hedge .

		What does the citizen do !

		He runs back to his house for his loaded gun and tries to get in the first shot at the intruder .

		Afterwards he protests that he has always been , and will always remain , a firm and devout Christian .

		No doubt some American readers have heard the story of the patriotic clergyman 's reply to the pacific-minded socialist , `` Where are the Christians , Sir .

		you ask ?

		The Christians are all at the front ! ''

		And I believe this is now coming to be true , for the reason that those who have suffered the horrors of war are far nearer to under - standing Christ 's teaching than those who , staying safe at home , pray for victory over the enemy .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's careful study of the figure of Jesus of
Nazareth	LOCATION	, one which I understand is fortified by his own impressions of Palestine , the people and the country , is therefore doubly welcome to any - one who , forced to face the atrocious facts of the most hideous war known to history , exam - ines for himself the foundations of Christ 's teaching .

		Let me say at once that though Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's conception and interpretation of Jesus seem to me essentially inadequate , his clever novel should help to stimulate people generally to separate the kernel from the husk of
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's teaching .

		I say `` clever , '' for could the author have risen to the height of the main conceptions embodied in the Sermon on the Mount , as
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	did , and have kept the psychological drama on the plane of that highest human altitude , the book would have been one of rare genius .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's genius , however , is of a feline order , as the admirers of `` Ave atque Vale '' know , one that reminds us of a woman suavely receptive , yet seriously pre - occupied with the effect of the last dress she has put on .

		Her malice she keeps for her dear friends , while her art is devoted to her own adornment .

		THE BROOK KERITH .

		By
Georze Moore	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		192 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	`` The Brook Kerith '' is , as one might expect , most able in its reflection of an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	atmosphere , of the Jewish ,
Pagan	LOCATION	, and early Christian ideas of the period , of the concep - tions and practices of primitive sects , such as the
Essenes	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has always shown extraordinary skill in assimilating and repro - ducing , in a manner all his own , the literary model he has studied .

		First it was Baudelaire , then Zola , then Manet , and
Whistler	LOCATION	's art criticism , then
Wagner	PERSON	's operas , Catholicism , and
Ireland	LOCATION	, successively claimed his atten - tion .

		Lastly he gave us his brilliant , witty , and studiously indiscreet series of reminis - cences of himself and his contemporaries , vol - umes in which his genius for posing made for as much delight as his confidences about his old friends .

		And now he has placed in his debt all lovers of literature as well as all the polite professors of drawing-room Christian ethics .

		From `` The Brook Kerith '' the latter will learn that Jesus , resuscitated by
Joseph	PERSON	of Arimathea after he had lain in the sepulchre and secreted by him many months in his home on
Mount Scropas	LOCATION	, returned to the eenoby of the
Essenes	LOCATION	on the
Jordan	PERSON	, where he abjured his mission , looked with horror on his claim to be the promised Messiah , j repented of the revolutionary violence of his I teaching in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and lived out his thirty remaining years of life as an obscure humble shepherd , leading his flocks on the mountains above
Jordan	PERSON	.

		Lest the disciple of Church Christianity accuse our author , in Dean Swift 's words , of being one of those who `` learn polite behavior by making gibes against their Savior , '' let us insist that `` The Brook Kerith '' is a work of high artistic skill and genuine imaginative intensity .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has doubtless studied Renan and the latter-day exponents of modern Biblical crit - icism ; and he has been at the utmost pains to construct , out of the palimpsest of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	's varied narratives , a Christ humanly credible in relation to his Jewish atmosphere and environment .

		So far as cunning actuality of local color into which a chosen mosaic of historical evi - dence has been artfully worked , can take us , `` The Brook Kerith '' is a tour de force , masterly by virtue of its homogeneous atmos - phere , harmony of tone , and exquisite style .

		From the aspect of artistic craftsmanship , the picture , by its general arrangement , mellow harmony of tone , and perfect drawing of the figures and landscape , vies with an old Dutch master , say
Terburg	ORGANIZATION	.

		Learned critics may , for aught we know , pick to pieces this his - torical tapestry , and demonstrate that the life of
Joseph	PERSON	of Arimathea 's household , of the Essene eenoby , of the fisher disciples of
Galilee	LOCATION	, of the Pharisees and Saducees in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	is false , historically and socially .

		But even should this be so , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	would find himself in the company of Rembrandt , whose Scriptural scenes are imaginative masterpieces , albeit his figures in street and tabernacle are palpably transmogrified Dutch burghers and beggars of the seventeenth cen - tury .

		As a cunning literary artist , Mr.
Moore	PERSON	in `` The Brook Kerith '' is , we repeat , beyond reproach ; and though a strong note of affec - tation is audible in the detailed narrative of Jesus of
Nazareth	LOCATION	's shepherd preoccupation with scab and wolves and shearing-time and scarcity of good strains of rams , oddly enough this affectation damages very little the harmony of the picture .

		At times one thinks that Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has palpably overdone the stupidity of
Simon Peter	PERSON	and the simplic - ity of the disciples ; but , after all , what mat - ter ?

		To atone , his portrait of
Paul	PERSON	, the worldly Christian zealot who , confronted with
Jesus of Nazareth	ORGANIZATION	in the flesh , thirty years after the Crucifixion , struggles hard to con - vert him to his faith that there is but one Mediator between God and Man , Christ Jesus our Lord , who came to redeem the world by his death on the cross , his portrait of
Paul	PERSON	, we repeat , is one of great literary cunning .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has carefully led up to this ironical situation : Jesus recoiling in horror from the fictitious , supernatural Christ of
Paul	PERSON	's imagining , and from the whole fabric of the legend of God 's raising His Son from the dead .

		It is a situation which would greatly delight
Anatole France	LOCATION	, and one no doubt which may shock the feelings of that great public which is so concerned with the preservation of the husk of Christianity that it troubles little about the kernel .

		But the grace and suavity of the scene in which the Apostle
Paul	PERSON	is led to declare that he is laboring to bring the whole world to
Christ	LOCATION	, while the mature utterances of Jesus the
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	walking by his side he rejects as those of an evil spirit or of a madman , can not blind us to our author 's root psychological failure .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, like so many of the commentators , has been sadly perplexed by the seeming contradiction between the Christ who uttered the command - ment `` Resist not evil , '' and the Christ who in wrath scourged the hypocrites and
Phari	PERSON	- sees and drove the money-changers out of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	.

		And he cuts the Gordian knot by making Jesus in his solitude repent of his presumption and pride when he believed that he was the Messiah , and condemn as evil and blasphemous all his anger and harshness
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 193 against the priest , and the iniquities of the world : It came to me to understand that all striving was vain and worse than vain .

		The pursuit of a corrupt crown as well as the pursuit of an incorruptible crown leads us to sin .

		If we would reach the sinless state we must relinquish pursuit .

		What I mean is this , that he who seeks the incorruptible crown starts out with words of love on his lips to persuade men to love God and finding that men do not love him he begins to hate them and hate leads on into persecution .

		Such is the end of all wor - ship ,
Paul	PERSON	.

		Jesus is made to relapse into a state of Buddhistic passivism ; and though this spir - itual refuge may seem the only logical solu - tion to Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, the grandeur of Christ 's divine pity for the weak and the suffering undergoes almost complete eclipse .

		So much so indeed that in one of the last scenes we see Jesus hurrying away from a great crucifixion of robbers near
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, ordained by the Roman procurator , so that he , Jesus , may escape the memory of their cries and faces ; and then he becomes lost in a vision of his own story , his own mistakes , his own sins !

		In short , the creator of the great command - ment , `` Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy - self , '' steadily shrinks into a being perfectly comprehensible , in thought and act , to Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's philosophic reason .

		We fear that Humanity will not gain by the exchange , and that the stricken millions , dying , will still instinctively call on the name of the old Christ .

		None the less , we are grateful to Mr.
Moore	PERSON	for `` The Brook Kerith , '' and we anticipate that the book may stimulate many Christian clerics to the production of some very moving sermons .

		RECENT FICTIOX .

		* Some time ago there appeared a newspaper article which began with the question , `` Why should n't American novelists be American ? ''

		When one first reads a remark like this , one is tempted to say , Why indeed ?

		and to won - der who wishes to prevent American novelists from being American .

		But an answer was provided in the next sentence : `` Why do cer - tain critics insist that they should be French or Russian or English with an Oxford accent ? ''

		Whitman -LRB- author of '' Children of Hope '' and the `` Isle of Life '' -RRB- , whose utterances were voiced some time since by Mr.
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	, was calling for a literary Declaration of I Independence .

		I wish very much not to put myself on j either side -LRB- if there be sides -RRB- in such a dis - | cussion .

		It might be said that a good many J American novelists are American .

		Take three ' such books as Miss
Canfield	PERSON	's `` The Bent !

		Twig , '' Miss Gather 's `` The Song of the I Lark , '' and Mrs.
Watt	PERSON	's `` The Rudder '' books which are among the best novels of the year ; they are certainly American enough , not only in subject -LRB- that is not the whole thing -RRB- but in manner of thought , mode of expression , everything .

		And so a great many other of our current novels are American in all sorts of ways .

		There is one reason , however , why Ameri - can novelists should not be American , or rather why they are not American , and that is because they either can not or will not study the life which they see and get their ideas and impressions at first-hand .

		For instance , take Mr.
Owen Johnson	PERSON	and his book , `` The Woman Gives . ''

		Of this book the publishers say : `` As you read you joy in the youth and love of Bohemian life , you are enthralled by the mystery of
Dangerfield	PERSON	's past , and touched to the heart by the greatness of Inga 's sacrificial spirit . ''

		And those elements are certainly in the book -LRB- as well as pictures by Mr.
Christie	PERSON	-RRB- ; but as you read for your - self you can see why Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	, for one , is not American .

		It is not because anyone wants him to be Russian , French , or anything else , but simply because he does not , probably can not , study American life at first-hand , but instead makes his book out of tried and tested literary conventions of which he readily imag - ines interesting illustrations .

		When Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	first wrote his
Lawrenceville	LOCATION	stories , people in general -LRB- who had no conception of
Lawrenceville	LOCATION	-RRB- were astonished and delighted in his revelations of boy-life ; when he wrote `` Stover at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	'' there arose murmurs about
Yale	ORGANIZATION	life not really being like that ; when he proceeded to `` The Fifty-first Second '' people at once said , `` Now I do n't believe your pro- digious
Hickey	PERSON	, '' because it became clear that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	had his eye on life merely to fill in the molds and forms otherwise existing in his own mind , which molds and forms had come there , not as being made by life itself , but as a result of reading books .

		All the accuracy of touch and detail in `` The Woman Gives '' can not make it really American or really good .

		There is doubtless Bohemian - ism , mystery , and sacrifice in American life , 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	but in Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's book it does not ring true .

		It sounds too much like literature , too much like other things we have read , too much , indeed , like the movie and the popular monthly .

		People may read it for amusement or for thrills , but hardly for some real pre - sentation -LRB- not to say interpretation -RRB- of the life either about us or anywhere else .

		Perhaps it is not worth while to say so much about Mr.
Owen Johnson	PERSON	.

		He repre - sents a kind of literature that will always exist , and people will always enjoy his books who doubtless will never read these lines .

		We may pass from his story of
New York	LOCATION	life to another book which also may be called Amer - ican .

		This is `` Witte Arrives , '' by Mr.
Elias Tobenkin	PERSON	.

		This book , we are told , is `` the great American novel which
Eobert Herrick	ORGANIZATION	once said an immigrant would rise and write . ''

		But if an immigrant writes , is it not too likely that we may have something of those dreadful foreign influences which some people think are crushing out our natural lit - erature ?

		Especially is it not possible that one who would seem -LRB- from this story -RRB- to be a Russian Jew might have something of that `` black , brooding melancholy '' which Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	discerns in the Russians in
America	LOCATION	and which he rightly takes to be something very different from the American attitude of mind ?

		Such apprehensions may be at once put aside .

		Mr.
Elias Tobenkin	PERSON	, though he has little of that `` optimistic commercialism '' which is to be seen in many American books , has not much of that delight in woe which some people think characteristic of Russian books .

		In fact , he has little of anything traditional or conventional about him .

		It is not that he has discovered new and profoundly original sources of American nationality , nor new or profoundly original ideas as to the American future .

		It may be that Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	's book may not have quite the success that awaited the first production of
Elias Witte	PERSON	, his hero .

		The American public is likely enough to think it has read of such matters before .

		So indeed it has .

		Almost anyone can remember books of the last few years in which immigrants or the children of immigrants have , by their sym - pathetic presentation of things that as immi - grants they knew , been able to arouse the interest of the American public .

		But whether there be other such books or not is hardly to the point .

		This book resembles
Witte	PERSON	's book in one respect -LRB- which was probably in the author 's mind -RRB- , namely , that it has distinctly the air of being made up of `` things one has lived through , sufferings one has experienced in one 's own soul . ''

		How this little Russian who settled in the West became an American not only as
Ameri	LOCATION	- can as the rest but rather more so , is the sub - ject of Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	's book , and it is a subject on which he has first-hand knowledge .

		I think myself that his knowledge , though first-hand -LRB- and therefore fit subject for good litera - ture -RRB- , is not as broad as may be imagined by some .

		It is written of
Witte	ORGANIZATION	, on a first visit to a municipal lodging house , that `` it took but a single keen look to discern and separate the few derelicts in the crowd from the hon - est , well-intentioned working men , clerks and , here and there , even a professional man . ''

		I must doubt if that single keen look really dis - cerned and separated correctly in that most most difficult chaos of humanity to be found on such occasions .

		It is not of much impor - tance : Mr.
Tobenkin	PERSON	may at times fill in the gaps in his real knowledge of real life with other matters .

		There seems little ground for thinking that
Witte	PERSON	's editorials `` attracted attention particularly by their Emersonian flavor '' ; they may have , but if so it must have been an injected flavor , for in
Witte	ORGANIZATION	's earlier life one sees very little of the spirit of Emer - son .

		But these matters are trifles .

		The main thing is that the book really does put into lit - erary form one of those experiences that may teach us much about
America	LOCATION	.

		Another of the newer books may also be spoken of here , Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	's `` The Heart of
Rachael	PERSON	. ''

		Perhaps one would not feel that this book is distinctively American , for it deals with that phase of life which on the surface seems made up of tennis , golf , danc - ing and bridge , flirtations and gossip , cock - tails and dinners , clubs and country-houses ; and such life is perhaps no more American than anything else .

		But Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	is not much concerned with the superficial aspects of such existence ; she takes it because it pre - sents something which she probably thinks is really one of the characteristic phases of the life of our day .

		The book presents a view of the question -LRB- if it be one -RRB- of divorce .


Rachael	PERSON	is a woman .

		who married a young man who had been divorced .

		He was a man of loose and careless habits , who drank too much and made life for his wife intolerable .

		There were various circumstances which aggravated the misunderstandings , but in course of time she became convinced that she could not live with him , applied for a divorce , and as he made no resistance , got it .

		It must be con - fessed that about the time she found it impos - sible to live with her husband she found that she was in love with an old friend and he with her .

		As soon as she was free they were married .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 195 So much seems , when baldly told , little more than extravaganza , although Mrs. Nor - ris of course makes it seem not unnatural .

		It may be that in the circles which she has in mind such things are common enough .

		But common or not , the real story begins at this point .

		Here Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	has a chance to pre - sent the influence of loose and easy views of divorce on married life and upon life in gen - eral .

		And though doubtless her main interest lay in her people and what they were to do and how they did it , yet her chief idea , as one may say , was to present the prevalent view of divorce , the loose and easy modes of regard - ing marriage that prevail today , the effective power of the finest married life , the impres - sive character of real if apparently limited religion , and other such things as develop out of this well imagined situation .

		No very great original ideas , these , nor does Mrs.
Xorris	PERSON	present them as such ; they are inter - woven with the life she presents in such a way that one feels them to be the testimony of life .

		And that makes a good book : per - haps people will not like it as much as `` The Story of Julia Page '' ; it certainly has not the variety of phases of human life that one found there , nor should I say there was quite so much good character drawing .

		But char - acter drawing does not seem to be Mrs. Nor - ris 's strong point , though her people are real and natural enough , they do not make a very lasting impression .

		She is at her best when she is showing what are so often called the deeper things of life , as they come to the surface by one or another incident or situ - ation .

		And this she does in the present book as she has often done before .

		Let us turn from these American novels to some English books , particularly the two which will naturally come together in people 's minds .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's `` The Sailor '' and Mr.
McFee	PERSON	's `` Casuals of The Sea '' will almost inevitably be compared .

		Some will like one better , others will like the other ; but both books are good , especially for people who like that sort of thing .

		It has been a question with us as to whether this or that book really and rightly presented or interpreted the con - ditions of the life of our time , American or any other .

		That , however , seems very clearly the object of both Mr.
McFee	PERSON	and Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	.

		Each undoubtedly has first interest in his chief character , but the method of each is distinctly in the direction of realizing con - ditions of life .

		It may be for this reason that neither writer steers clear of the deep gloom which Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	reprehends as being so un-American and so characteristic of foreign writers .

		It might be said at once that neither of these stories is distinctly a sea-story .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	is a well-known and effective novelist without especial predilection for the sea .

		Mr.
McFee	PERSON	, a new writer , is a practical sailor familiar with the sea at first-hand ; but he does not make the sea the dominating element in his book .

		The very title , `` Casuals of the Sea , '' has a figurative turn ; he uses the expression not only directly as applied to tramp steamers but also figuratively to drift - ers here and there upon the sea of life , `` cas - uals of the way-worn earth , '' he calls them in his Dedication .

		To discern between the excellencies of these two books will be for many an interesting exercise of the critical faculty , nor would it be worth while to anticipate such comparison and criticism .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	has in mind a new rendering of a subject of perennial interest , the development of a man of genius .


Henry Harper	PERSON	has a miserable childhood in the slums of a provincial town , a hard experience as a sailor for several years , a brief excitement when he gets back from his voyage , as a bril - liant football player , and then settling in
London	LOCATION	he is led by curious circumstances to find himself a great novelist .

		All this is excel - lently done .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	never loses sight of his subject , which he views with a dry and somewhat cynical air .

		If one can stand the accumulated misery of the beginning , one will like the book .

		The surroundings have the air of real life ; and though Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's personal attitude seems almost to preclude sympathy for his people , yet the interest keeps up .

		The main figure , however , seems to me too silently and idiotically stupid ever to have lived long , not to say developed into a great novelist .

		But that , of course , is Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's thesis , in a way , to show how the artistic tempera - ment grew and developed in a nature so utterly unable to master the practical things of life .

		Mr.
McFee	PERSON	's book will be read for some - thing different , not so much for his chief figure or figures as for the general `` slice of life '' which he presents .

		The scenes at sea are immensely interesting , but not so much so -LRB- in my mind -RRB- as the career of Minnie which precedes it .

		The fortune of a sister and a brother is what interests Mr.
McFee	PERSON	, and that one should be a sailor does not make the book a sea story any more than that the other 's wayward and casual life makes the book anything else .

		What I relish most is the general tone of the thing , a picture of life it is doubtless , but seen through a very decided temperament .

		I wish I could give more study and more space to Mr.
McFee	PERSON	's view of life .

		196 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	his disposition , his way of putting things .

		He is not merely the sailor , he has ideas and opinions , and also eyes with which he has seen many interesting things and people .

		Mr.
McFee	PERSON	is just as interesting to me when he writes about advertising as when he writes of the sea , perhaps more .

		It is his quality that is really the thing .

Grace King	ORGANIZATION	really knows
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		She was born there , `` raised '' there , and lives there now .

		She was an impressionable little girl when the city was captured by the Yan - kees , and she possessed exactly the right num - ber of years to comprehend the horrors of the reconstruction regime .

		Her book , ``
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the Place and the People , '' has delighted the inhabitants and instructed the tourists ; she is a specialist in the social life of the South .

		Her historical works , her essays in biography , her short stories , all deal with scenes on land and water familiar to her mem - ory and to her senses .

		Yet there is one respect in which this new book transcends all the oth - ers in importance : They were notable for their accurate knowledge , for their contribu - tive value .

		This new book gives her a definite place as a literary artist .

		Literary artists are rarer than competent historians .

		I have seen `` The Pleasant Ways of
St. Medard	ORGANIZATION	'' advertised as `` a lament for the old South at the close of the civil war and the humiliation of a ruined family . ''

		I do not need the word `` pleasant '' in the title to con - vince me of the ineptitude of this description .

		Lamentation is not the right word for the golden fruits of autumn or for the soft haze of Indian Summer .

		Furthermore our author , whose personality has appeared clearly enough in her preceding books , has neither talent nor inclination for mourning .

		These sketches have the charm of `` II Penseroso '' rather than the bitterness of woe .

		And out of the ruins of health , and wealth , and aristo - cratic assurance rises Character in these pages indomitable , indestructible .

		kees , I am grateful to the author for a bril - liant demonstration of
Browning	PERSON	's line , Leave the fire ashes , what survives is gold .

		The journey into a far country , with which the book begins , is rather remarkable for its dispassionate calm .

		It describes how the proud family moved in a horse-car through streets crowded with shabby Confederates and smart Federal soldiers , free and independent negroes impeding pedestrians on the pave - ment , to a suburb where decayed gentility must somehow contrive to exist without a grimace .

		The complete absence of harsh emphasis will make this Hegira all the more impressive to discriminating readers .

		Then as we advance into the succeeding chapters , new characters appear , at first vaguely , then sharpening in outline , until we feel intimacy .

		Perhaps I shall remember
Tommy Cook	PERSON	the longest .

		For the last few chapters , describ - ing the fight with fever , and the interview between
Tommy	PERSON	and his sick master show something rare in American literature intense feeling controlled by perfect art .

		One shade the more , one ray the less , Had half impaired the nameless grace .

		If a word of advice to readers be not imper - tinent , let me suggest that this book be read slowly , a chapter at a time .

		It is a work to be savored , and can not be enjoyed if devoured .

		`` Windy
McPherson	PERSON	's Son , '' with the hor - rible tautology of sound in the title , differs from `` The Pleasant Ways of
St. Medard	ORGANIZATION	'' as a frontiersman differs from a Southern gentle - man .

		This novel has a certain raw vitality lacking in
Miss King	LOCATION	's pages ; but its crudity jars .

		One longs for less matter , with more art .

		Not a single person in this book seems real to me , and the reason is just the opposite from the common one .

		Most characters in works of fiction are unreal because their out - lines are faint , vague , confused ; the author has never realized them himself .

		Here each person is stressed with such force , the color laid on with such daubing profusion , that each man and woman is to me a caricature .

		They represent the reductio ad absurdum of certain traits and tendencies .

		Nor is there any architectural skill displayed .

		Like so many `` life '' novels of the twentieth century , there is a plentiful supply of incidents with - out any plot .

		The hero is a little newsboy when we see him first , and well on in years , with a recrudescent paunch , when we see him last the story progresses in time , but not in art .

		The last third of the book is picar - esque .

		The hero takes to the road , and passes through a series of indiscriminate adventures , which might have taken twenty , or twenty thousand pages , instead of the hundred arbi -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 197 trarily allotted by the author .

		Yet although I can not admire this book as an achievement , I think its failure contains the seeds of suc - cess .

		It is more promising than many novels which surpass it in dignity .

		The conglomer - ation of incident and the exaggeration of human characteristics display an abundant vitality and a high aim .

		The author has done his level best to write the great American novel , to represent unsparingly what he believes to be the truth .

		Some day his decided natural gifts will ripen ; he will not only see things in their proportion , he will be able to draw them according to scale ; and he will read many pages of this work with a smile .


Archibald Marshall	PERSON	is as reliable as the weather in
San Diego	LOCATION	, and fully as agreeable .

		It is difficult to analyse the extraordinary charm of his stories , for they are simpler than simplicity .

		He takes us to a pleasant coun - try-house , introduces us to a charming family , where each member has a distinct individu - ality , and the novel moves along like beautiful voices with orchestral accompaniment each individual in turn singing an air , while the fortunes of the whole family supply a basal interest .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	never disappoints us , for we know exactly what to expect in his work .

		I have read all his novels , and have never finished one without wishing it were longer , without wishing that we could follow his people farther .

		To read his books is exactly like entering into intimate relations with people whom we should like to know in real life not at all because of their social position , but because of their real worth .

		His good characters are fundamentally good .

		They are seldom brilliant , seldom social reformers .

		They are more altruistic than philanthropic .

		They possess the fine old vir - tues of purity , wholesomeness , generosity , loving kindness , honesty , loyalty , considera - tion ; such people are always lovable in real life , and they are lovable in `` Watermeads . ''

		And his villains are hardly villains at all .

		His heroes are not saviours of society , they are simply a daily blessing to all who know them ; and his villains commit no crimes , and never smack of melodrama .

		They are incon - siderate , stupid , tactless in real life we can not endure them , and they here receive the inevitable punishment of unpopularity .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	gives us on every page the delight of recognition these characters are so per - fectly drawn that we have the illusion of liv - ing with them .

		He particularly excels in the portrayal of young girls healthy , affection - ate young girls who enjoy out-door sport , and who are full of the kindlier virtues that assure j happy family life .

		Furthermore the setting !

		of these novels is exceedingly beautiful .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	loves the English country in sum - mer and winter .

		No one has given better pictures of the country-side in rain and sun - shine , in cold and heat ; and to sit down with the whole family in Watermeads to afternoon tea , in a fine old wainscoted hall , with the late autumn sunshine streaming through the tall windows , is simply to share in the pure do - mestic happiness of the scene .

		If there are any readers who do not like Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's novels , I am sorry for them .

		Yet these stories are not merely entertain - ing .

		Beneath the current of trivial incident and light conversation we find an idea that exerts in the reader 's mind , almost uncon - sciously , a moral force .

		This idea has been illustrated in such a variety of ways in his books that I believe it to be the foundation of the author 's moral philosophy .

		It is simply this , different individuals , different social classes , different nationalities dislike and dis - trust each other simply through ignorance .

		He would not say with the French , to under - stand is to forgive , he would say , to under - stand is to respect , to admire , to love .

		The inefficient aristocrat and the self-made mil - lionaire despise each other , the high church - man and the `` Wesleyan distrust each other 's motives until they are really brought together by circumstances into an enforced intimacy ; with the surprising and agreeable result `` Why , he 's an entirely different fellow from what I thought he was ! ''

		What individuals and nations need is more intelligence , more imagination then sympathy will follow as a matter of course .

		Could the English nation and the German nation meet as individuals the English would discover that the Germans are not brutish beasts , and the Germans would find that the English are not hypocrites .

		All of Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's novels in their quiet , artistic beauty are really an attack on that citadel of stupidity Prejudice .

Sylvia Lynd	PERSON	has written rather an extraordinary first novel in `` The Chorus '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , extraordi - nary because of the high quality of her character - izations .

		The story deals with a group of artists , craftsmen and dilettanti who have gathered about

		One of his apprentices ,
Hilda Concannon	PERSON	, has stumbled upon a sixteen-year-old waif in a Bloomsbury pen - sion , and partly because she is fascinated by the girl 's rare beauty and partly because her Scotch sense of duty impels her to take a hand in dis - 198 THE DIAL

Nelly	PERSON	, her pro- tegee , down to the country .

		Against a skilfully drawn background of studio and country-house life
Nelly	PERSON	takes her place as the heroine of an idyllic romance .

		It is easy to understand the mag - ical fascination which she exerts upon those who meet her , just as it is entirely comprehensible that
Hamel	PERSON	, verging upon the seared emotions of the forties , should experience a flare of adolescent infatuation .

		In dealing with the subtler emotions
Miss Lynd	PERSON	has a delicacy and firmness of touch which are often lacking in more experienced writers .

		It is this quality which makes the book entirely worth while for the sophisticated reader who enjoys playing with two-edged tools .

		The novel is marred in the end by the author 's whim - sical indifference to all demands of plot .

		She merely abandons her characters , scattering them with the petulance of a child weary of its toys , granting but one glimpse , and that too bizarre to be considered seriously , of
Nelly	PERSON	and her ultimate fate .

		It would be interesting might one know just why
Miss A. H. Fitch	PERSON	wrote `` The Breath of the Dragon '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Was she possessed with the desire to qualify as the author of a `` best seller '' or did she believe that two years ' residence in the American Legation at Peking had given her an insight into Chinese psychology ?

		We can not but suspect it was the former impulse which inspired this `` thriller , '' which concerns itself with the res - cue of a young revolutionist condemned to death .

		There is no lack of villainy , no lack of suspense , no lack of hair-breadth escapes for the hero , his lovely Manchu fiancee , and his American friend , whose ability to slip in and out of Chinese disguise will amaze anyone who really knows
China	LOCATION	.

		The story is a harmless and commonplace bit of melodrama with all the old tricks set out in a new but none-too-truthfully portrayed scene .

		It is to be regretted that in a land so fertile with material for subtle adventure , the author has been content to write only a lurid `` penny dreadful . ''

		There is a certain serenity , borne of an indom - itable spirit , to be found in the sketches of English life during the war , which make up
Alfred Olli	PERSON	- vant 's little volume `` The Brown Mare '' -LRB- Knopf -RRB- .

		Their chief interest lies in the fact that they are as simple and unassuming as personal letters would be during such a period .

		They are no more than wisps of life , little impressions gleaned at dinner , down Piccadilly , at the theatre , in the Park ; anec - dotes of men home on leave , men in hospital , and the others who will not go back to the trenches .

		So much has been written of the war that is hectic in its attempt to give the secure reader an impres - sion of vast frightfulness , that we are inclined to overlook the fact that even war after a time becomes monotonous and drab , just as does the life far behind the lines at home .

		These are pictures of home , and they have that quality of homely ten - derness , fortitude , and patience which endears the British race .

		Those who have known and loved
England	LOCATION	in happier days will find in these pages something precious and intimate and friendly .

		NOTES AND The publisher of THE DIAL announces that owing to the pressure of his duties at

		Late Associate Editor of
Easting	ORGANIZATION	's Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics For the general reader who desires breadth of understanding and culture , Mythology is as important a study as the history of nations , or the biography of men .

		It has to do with what the childhood of our race has thought of the
MAX MULLER	PERSON	SAYS : `` Mythology not only pervades the sphere of religion and tra - dition , but infects more or lesa the whole realm of thought . ''

		BOSTON TRANSCRIPT : `` Will test and en - compass the skill of scholars throughout the - world , '' mysteries of nature and of life , and how it has endeavored to interpret the spiritual forces governing human destiny which still feed our universal curiosity and provoke the never-answered WHY ?

		of our inward thoughts .

		Tap Mythology , the well-spring of our customs , religion , literature , art , philosophy , and music , and see the prehistoric phases of our own beliefs .

		Enjoy the quaint , beautiful , informative , or inspiring tales to which any given modern doctrine , legend , or superstition may usually be traced back .

		Feel the quickening and sympathy which come with reading of those distant ages and distant men as soon as we realize that here is the story of our own race indeed , of our own selves .

		Teachers owning or having access to this magnificent work can open a new world to their students .

		The stories , or very many of the myths entire , may be used in all grades of work from primary to college post-graduate .

		They can be made to correlate in teaching with biology , history , biography , English , and ethics in elementary and secondary school work , with music and art , philosophy , religion , philology , and anthropology as a source-book for advanced and research students .

		The many classical dictionaries and text-books bear testimony as to the impor - tance of mythology as a cultural study , and this it the first exhaustive and authoritative work on the subject in the English language .

		`` May safely be pronounced one of the most important enterprises of this age of co-operative scholarship . ''

		- Prof.
George F. Moon	PERSON	, LLD. ,
Harvard Univertity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each volume is the worlc of a scholar pre-eminent in his particular field , but `` written in a fashion so popular that they can not fail to interest the general reader . ''

		In the whole 13 volumes which the work comprises there are more than 800 beautiful illustrations , many in color , from native sources , including photogravures , four , three , and two-color prints , half tones , and line plates .

SEPTEMBER 21 , 1916	DATE	A TANTALUS IN THE BOOK-FLOOD .

		It used to be related of a mythical
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	postmistress that when the postcard was introduced she felt compelled to resign her place because she could not find time to read all the cards that passed through her hands .

		Similarly , though with less of myth , more than one librarian has deemed it best to vacate a position in which the temptation to read clashes with the call of duty .

		This conflict has notably increased with the swelling of the yearly book-flood , a torrent in which the lit - erature-loving librarian and the intellectually alert bookseller find themselves subjected to torments not unlike those inflicted upon Tantalus .

		But the victim of Jove 's wrath could by no effort slake his thirst in the slightest degree , whereas this modern
Tanta	LOCATION	- lus can drink long draughts if he is willing to pay the penalty .

		The librarian who reads -LRB- to the neglect of duty -RRB- is lost , or , rather , his position is in danger of being lost , as all the world knows ; and the bookseller whose nose is buried in a book instead of being uplifted to sniff the trade-winds is likely to lose his business .

		Consequently it can no longer be uncondi - tionally affirmed , as we find it affirmed by the worthy
Jared Bean	PERSON	-LRB- whom we are perhaps unduly fond of quoting -RRB- , that `` there is none so Felicitous as the Librarian , and none with so small a Cause of Ill-Content , Jealousy or Rancour . ''

		In these modern times of stren - uous library activity , of increasing effort to make every volume on the shelves circulate with maximum briskness , how can there be perfect content where the hungry one is daily doomed to witness the delights of feast - ing in which he has small part ?

		Let us for a brief space imagine the esurient sensations of him who presides at the literary banquet - board now bounteously spread for us , but must himself leave its successive courses all but untouched .

		His is the trying part of commending , as
Elia	LOCATION	has put it , `` the flavour of his venison upon the absurd strength of his never touching it himself . ''

		But the metaphor , or simile , is here becoming sadly mixed , and instead of a Tantalus we now have a Rabbi
Ben Ezra	PERSON	, whose lot it is to `` provide and not partake . ''

		No great harm is done , however ; so we will push on .

		Fiction , appealing to the largest class of readers , holds the most prominent place in the publishers ' announcements , and among the `` new and forthcoming '' novels Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's completed serial , `` The Leatherwood God , '' must for obvious reasons take no sub - ordinate position .

		Another shorter serial from the pages of the same magazine , and not inferior in power to hold the attention , is `` The Dark Tower , '' ascribed to
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	.

		The late
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's posthumous romance , ``
Enoch Crane	PERSON	, '' com - pleted by his son on the plan sketched in sufficient detail by the author , is sure of a wide reading .

		Among other notable contrib - utors to current fiction occur the familiar names :
Hewlett	LOCATION	,
Dreiser	PERSON	,
Bennett	PERSON	,
Locke	PERSON	,
Snaith	PERSON	,
Parker	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	,
Masefield	PERSON	,
McCutch	PERSON	- eon ,
George Moore	PERSON	,
Lucas Malet	PERSON	,
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	, Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	, and Mr. and Mrs. Castle .

		It may be of interest , and perhaps reassur - ing , to add that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, whose book , `` The Genius , '' has recently been raised to unanticipated celebrity by the Society for the Prevention of Vice , has been adjudged not guilty by the
Authors ' League of America	ORGANIZATION	, a society of which , be it noted , he is not now and never has been a member .

		On the whole , it is very evident that there is no lack of diversion offered in the form of romance to relieve the strain of the anxious and troubled times in which we live .

		The novel more than holds its own against the war-book as a pop - ular favorite .

		This war-book class , whatever its qualities as literature , is this year superior in quantity even to last year 's similar product .

		Without question the world has never before seen so prodigal a shedding of ink accompanying so frenzied a flow of blood .

		A whole library building has been devoted in one country , supremely militarist in its policy and tradi - tions , to the preservation of books and docu - 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	ments on the war .

		Whatever their permanent interest and worth , readers will not be lacking for such present-day claimants upon public attention as `` My Second Year of the Great War , '' by Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	; `` The
Dublin	LOCATION	Insurrection , '' by Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	; `` Gallipoli , '' by Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	; `` Priests on the Firing Line , '' by
M. Rene Gaell	PERSON	, and `` A French Mother in War Time , '' by
Madame Edouard Drumont	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of similar though more serious interest are `` The War and the Soul , '' by the Eev .


E. J. Campbell	PERSON	; `` The Christian Ethic of War '' -LRB- a seeming contradiction in terms -RRB- , by Dr.
P. T. Forsyth	PERSON	; `` The Hope of the
Great Community	ORGANIZATION	, '' by the late Professor Eoyce ; and `` To-morrow , '' by Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	.

		Turning for relief to something more like pure literature , if there be any such thing , one notes with anticipations of enjoyment Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	's book on `` The Advance of the English Novel , '' Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	's collection of essays , `` The Pleasures of an Absentee Landlord , '' Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's offering of `` A Sheaf of Wild Oats , '' Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	's `` Henry James : A Critical Study , '' Mr.
Ernest Boyd	PERSON	's ``
Ireland	LOCATION	's Literary Eenaissance , '' Professor
Eichard Burton	PERSON	's ``
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	: The Man and the Mask , '' and other equally attractive produc - tions of scholarship and taste .

		Poetry and drama offer something of worth to the few and select readers of such litera - ture few in a comparative sense , of course , and increasing encouragingly every year .

		A collection of the late
John Hay	PERSON	's poems , including many pieces never before put between covers , must take a leading place in any enumeration of current publications in verse .

		Younger versifiers this year promi - nently mentioned are represented in the pub - lishers ' lists by such names as
Noyes	LOCATION	,
Masefield	PERSON	,
Yeats	PERSON	,
Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Eabindranath Tagore	PERSON	,
Hagedorn	LOCATION	,
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, and many more .

		The `` Modern Drama Series '' contains much good reading of its kind , and separate works from our industrious young play - wrights are to be had in plenty an abun - dance strongly in contrast with the scarcity of only a few years ago , before the printed play had fairly begun to vie with the acted play as a source of entertainment .

		In history occur such scholarly works as ``
Ireland	LOCATION	under the Stuarts and during the Interregnum , '' by Mr.
Eichard Bagwell	PERSON	this magnum opus is now in its third volume ; `` Christianity and Nationalism in the Later Eoman Empire , '' by Mr.
E. L. Woodward	PERSON	; `` A Political and Social History of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
C. J. H. Hayes	PERSON	; a rather formidable work on
Mongolia	LOCATION	, limited in its edition but less limited in its price ; a study of
Poland	LOCATION	's social and economic history ; an economic and social history of
Europe	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	; and other like vol - umes in sufficient number to prove that the world is interested in something besides war and romance .

		Biography , which is history in another form , offers books of note .

		Most attractive , in a cursory survey of titles , is `` The Life of
John Fiske	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
John Spencer Clarke	PERSON	, a lifelong friend and associate of the histo - rian .

		Fiske 's earlier work as librarian makes him especially interesting to the profession , though it plays but little part in his rich and varied life as a whole .

		That so accomplished a chronicler of other men 's lives should have waited so long to have his own life written in full may not prove to be cause for regret when that finished work at last appears .

		A promising biography of
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	, on an equal scale , comes from the pen of ex-Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	.

		Lives of
Booker T.	ORGANIZATION
Washington	LOCATION	, Sir
John Henniker Heaton	PERSON	, and `` 0 .

		Henry '' will not go begging for buyers and readers .

		`` My Eemembrances , '' by Mr.
E. H. Sothern	PERSON	, completes its serial appearance and takes more permanent and convenient form .

		That strongly marked char - acter , already known to readers , Mr.
Charles A. Eastman	PERSON	, takes them still further into his confidence in a volume entitled `` From the Deep Woods to Civilization : Chapters in the Autobiography of an Indian . ''

		Eichard
Watson Gilder	PERSON	's letters form another of the season 's most inviting volumes .

		Let us conclude with a few scattering titles of varied character .

		Dr.
Grenf	PERSON	ell 's `` Tales of the Labrador '' are true stories of toil and hardship and perilous adventure in the far North , picturing the life and occupations of his people in the bleak latitudes of almost per - petual snow and ice .

		A timely presentation of `` Caribbean Interests of the
United States	LOCATION	'' is from the careful pen of Mr.
Chester Lloyd Jones	PERSON	.

		`` Mediation , Investigation , and Arbitration in Industrial Disputes , '' by Mr.
George E. Barnett	PERSON	and Mr.
David A. McCall	PERSON	, is such a work as was never more needed than
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 215 now .

		`` The Clan of Munes , '' which purports to be `` the true story of the wonderful new tribe of fairies discovered by
Frederick Judd `` Waugh	PERSON	, '' excites curiosity .

		The person of long experience in handling books and reading book-titles , such as is the j gray-haired librarian or the elderly book - seller , can hardly fail to remark with concern the somewhat alarming scarcity that is mak - ing itself felt in the supply of new names for the products of literary industry .

		This season sees the repetition of several old titles , as in Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	's `` Men , Women and Ghosts , '' a book of poems not reminiscent of
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps	PERSON	in anything but name .

		Admiral
Fitzgerald	PERSON	gives us `` From Sail to Steam , '' a book of naval recollections similar in character to Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's work of precisely the same name .

		But Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's `` Profit and Loss '' will not , it is safe to pre - dict , be confounded with Mr.
Alphonso A. Hopkins	PERSON	: s `` Profit and Loss in Man . ''

		Remi - niscent touches of this sort in book-titles are what the trained librarian , more particularly if he be also a trained cataloguer , is qualified to appreciate .

		Not exactly alien to this genus , either , is the continuation of Professor
Arne Fisher	PERSON	's learned treatise on `` The Mathemat - ical Theory of Probabilities and its
Applica	LOCATION	- tion to Frequency Curves and Statistical Methods . ''

		With this manual in hand the librarian ought to grapple successfully with questions of library statistics and the fre - quency of book-losses and other periodic occurrences within his domain .

		Again , if he -LRB- or more probably she -RRB- be a children 's libra - rian , interest will be awakened by the announcement of the forthcoming `` Bunny - fluffkins , '' and `` Twinkletoes and Nibblenuts , '' and the `` Tin Owl Stories . ''

		But our space is filled , the printer 's devil waits at the door , and still a quantity of good things in store for readers must remain unmentioned .

		Other departments of litera - ture here passed over in silence all have their new books of worth and some of con - spicuous merit .

		But a good book is its own best advertiser , and its failure to receive prominent mention in any preliminary and partial survey will work it no lasting injury .

		The reviewer , like the librarian and the book - seller , is tantalized by the wealth before him , and must forego the pleasure even of calling others ' attention to much that he himself may never hope to enjoy .

		PRCY R BlCKNELL .

		BRIEFS ON XEW BOOKS .

		The second and concluding vol - national ume of Mr.
W. B. Brvan	PERSON	s `` His - '' tory of the National Capital '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- carries the account through the period 1815-18 , or until the adoption of the existing organic act for the government of
the District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the wider pub - lic it is a period less interesting than the period of foundation , or than the most recent period of enlightened return to the concep - tions of the founders ; for it is a period of relative pettiness , neglect , and enforced self - dependence .

		The apathy of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the national responsibility for the capital , and the efforts of citizens toward improvement , through various forms of local government , fill a large part of the volume .

		National movements , such as abolition , temperance , or enfranchisement , find also local exemplifica - tions , though not of extraordinary signifi - cance .

		The minutize of development in taxa - tion , education , public improvements , and so on , are for the most part faithfully chron - icled , although occasionally there are sur - prising omissions .

		The same discursiveness and lack of larger organization which marked the previous volume are apparent in this one .

		which nevertheless forms a rich collection of information for students of particular ques - tions as well as for those specially interested in the city of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		There can be no question that Professor
Hollingworth	PERSON	writes upon a timely theme in his `` Vocational Psychology '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		It is also a theme open to a variety of pretenders , who advertise their ability to determine what you are fit for and to improve the quality of your capacities .

		The topic is raised to a high practical interest by the fact that men must seek and find employment , and the determi - nation of fitness has a market value .

		Profes - sor
Hollingworth	PERSON	reviews the ambitious attempts in past and present to short-cut the road to information and find the land - marks of human capacities .

		He shows how inevitably the problem was reshaped by the laboratory methods of modern psychology .

		The testing of mental ability has become an art , though one imperfectly established .

		If modestly applied , it at the least discovers the incompetent and submits criteria for more rigid selection .

		When compared with the tests of schools and with the impressionistic methods of the employer , it demonstrates its superiority .

		Professor
Hollingworth	PERSON	's book 216 THE DIAL is in substance the first to set forth the scien - tific basis of vocational fitness ; if it fails to go as far as one could wish , it lays the foun - dations solidly and shows how cautiously one must proceed .

		It is at once a review of meth - ods and results and a guide to the study of aptitudes .

		One of the topics most fully and ably considered is the discussion of what traits go together ; and another is the study of judgments of ability and their value .

		A chapter contributed by Mrs.
Hollingworth	PERSON	makes a study of the aptitudes of men and women .

		The negative findings of tests are emphasized , and from them is drawn a con - clusion as to comparability of quality which may arouse question , the question whether the qualities tested in any manner exhaust the significant points of difference or merely play about the edges .

		At all events the book may be recommended to those who are per - sonally or professionally interested in the study of the qualities which the world uses and selects in its complicated business .

		Mr.
James Phinney Munroe	PERSON	is Assays .

		nala known as a thoughtful essayist and public-spirited citizen , with wide interests wisely pursued .

		His recent volume takes its title from the opening essay , `` The New England Conscience '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , and discourses discerningly upon that curi - ous product .

		In his view , `` those whom it now tortures with its hot pincers of doubt and self-reproach are sacrificed to a cause long since won . ''

		For in these days , alike democratic and cosmopolitan , `` the narrow has become the broad road with a demi-tasse substituted for a pie . ''

		The typical examples by which he adds unity to the volume range over a considerable diversity of interesting subjects .

		``
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, the New England Democrat , '' ``
Josiah Quincy	PERSON	, the New Eng - land Aristocrat , '' `` The Town of
Lexington	LOCATION	, '' `` The Destruction of the Ursuline Convent at
Charlestown	LOCATION	, '' this latter an amazing tale of religious prejudice and mob law in
1834	DATE	, in which the dramatis personnce are a tactless mother superior , an ignorant girl who spread mysterious stories of abuse , and a group of young ladies undergoing training in the accomplishments of needlework , painting , dancing , and the use of the globes ; while the concluding essays are devoted to
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, `` The Heart of the United States '' -LRB- the middle west -RRB- ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, `` The Eternal Feminine , '' and
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	.

		The entire series of essays is sustained upon a high level of critical analysis and timely com - ment , which give the volume substantial value along with readability and charm .

		The modern doctor 's dissertation ^ as in manv cases taken to itself the form and comeliness as well as the portliness of the comfortable octavo , so that in outward appearance it differs not from other books .

		But usually the contents are the same in kind and degree , if not in quantity , as those of the more modest unbound pamphlets of the author 's own pub - lication .

		So Dr.
Charles E. Whitmore	PERSON	's `` The Supernatural in Tragedy '' comes out , with the imprimatur of the
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	, as a respectable volume of 370 pages , including an - index .

		It takes all tragedy for its material , that is , all the tragedy of ``
Greece	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	in both ancient and modern times , '' and shows how the supernatural appears in this portentous body of literature .

		Such a task involves the outlining of many plots , than which nothing is more painful reading , and in the work before us it is accomplished without the slightest charm of style .

		The various forms of the supernatural are considered , such as Fate , devils and angels , witches and ghosts , and certain manifestations of nature with supernatural suggestions such as storms and the sea , and these are treated as intrinsic , that is , with influence upon character , and as dec - orative , that is , for purely passing effect .

		A marked series of stages is seen in Greek tragedy , from the surpassing skill of JEschy - lus through the subordination of the super - natural in Sophocles into the declining and conventionalized treatment of Euripides .

		The mediaeval sacred drama is treated at great length , disproportionately so , consider - ing the relative dramatic and aesthetic value of the supernatural in this drama .

		The whole period of Elizabethan drama is given only about twenty pages more .

		One might ques - tion , too , whether more is not made of the supernatural in ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' in regarding the ghost as the dominant agent in the down -
fall	DATE	of the conspirators , as if
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's spirit were to be considered in the same light as the ghost in `` Hamlet . ''

		`` Some modern aspects '' of the supernatural are taken up in the periods of the Restoration and the eighteenth century , and in the modern revival in Eng - land and the works of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, D `
Annunzio	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		The Greek spelling , as `` Klytai - mestra , '' `` Aischylos , '' etc. , provides the needed pedantic touch .

		`` On the Campus '' -LRB- Torch Press -RRB- , by President
Thomas H. Macbride	PERSON	of the
State Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Iowa	LOCATION	, is not a book descriptive of college life , but a collection of addresses Lectures to college audiences .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 217 delivered at various times and places in the last fifteen years before university and col - lege audiences .

		These addresses , fourteen in number , treat of educational questions and topics in natural science , six of them having to do with plant life , if we include in the six an admirable literary-botanical dissertation on `` The Botany of Shakespeare '' and one on `` The Folk-lore of Plants . ''

		Literary allu - sions are not lacking in other parts of the book , and occasional apt quotations from the poets give charm and variety to the discourse .

		In the very first of these quotations it is some - thing of a shock , one must confess , to find a familiar couplet from
Shelley	PERSON	's `` Skylark '' strangely misquoted , which the author 's revi - sion of his lectures for publication would not have led us to expect .

		Significant is the fol - lowing from this experienced educator : `` There is very little that education , however | fortunate , is competent to do for any man ... !

		No system of training ever devised can make ; a man wise ; no system save that of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	herself , and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's system demands the whole of a human life , and even then is , I ; am sure , not always successful . ''

		From `` The Gifts of Science '' we select a few lines as j illustrative of the author 's felicitous style : | `` But by far the greatest part of the debt of !

		science to the world is paid in service .

		Apollo ; must needs guide the flocks of Admetus . '

		Whoever will be greatest among you , let him i be your minister . '

		.

		.

		Everywhere science j serves : discovery passing into invention , j research resulting in appliance . ''

		Germans in
Germany	LOCATION	's defense .

		of the utterances : neither the justice nor the expediency of any act of the German authori - ties is called in question .

		There is nothing of the frankness or intellectual suppleness which characterize the writings of that brilliant free-lance ,
Maximilian Harden	PERSON	, a collection of whose editorials would be vastly more reveal - ing than the outpourings of the whole mobil - ized professionate .

		The essays appear to have been written in the
spring of 1915	DATE	; much water has flowed under our bridges since then .

		The translator , Dr.
William Wallace White	PERSON	- lock , has performed his task acceptably , and has also edited his material somewhat for the better information and convenience of Ameri - can readers .

		`` Deutschland und der Welt - krieg , '' a collection of essays by a number of leaders of thought in
Germany	LOCATION	, has been translated into Eng - lish under the title of `` Modern
Germany	LOCATION	in Relation to the Great War '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- .

		The book constitutes the most pro-German argument that has yet been presented to the American public .

		The nineteen authors of these essays are , with two exceptions , univer - sity professors .

		The two exceptions are state functionaries ; but as a university professor in
Germany	LOCATION	is also a state functionary of another kind , the whole book has inevitably an official and governmental air about it .

		The authors -LRB- among them such well-known men as
Delbriick	LOCATION	,
Schmoller	PERSON	, and
Oncken	PERSON	speak ex cathedra , and the reader gains the impression that it is thus and not otherwise that the Ger - man government would have its people and the world at - large believe .

		This impression is heightened by the rigidity and uniformity More of sir Thirty-five years ago there began
Henry Lucy	PERSON	's to appear in `` Punch '' a series '' '' of parliamentary reports in the form of the diary of `` Toby , M. P. , '' the mem - ber from Barkshire , who in private life was `` Mr.
Punch	PERSON	's dog . ''

		These reviews were written by
Henry Lucy	PERSON	, an obscure journal - ist , who later rose to great fame in the Eng - lish editorial world and finally was honored with knighthood .

		The `` diary '' was a success from the very first , and it was with real regret that the readers of `` Punch '' learned last Feb - ruary that Toby had applied for the steward - ship of the
Chiltern Hundreds	ORGANIZATION	.

		The genial reporter could not , of course , include all his observations in his newspaper contributions ; but many have been saved for us in his books , especially in a series of three volumes devoted chiefly to parliamentary men and manners , of which the third , `` Nearing Jordan '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , has recently appeared .

		This volume is made up of anecdotes and sketches of public men whom Sir
Henry	PERSON	knew more or less inti - mately , and covers approximately the
last two decades of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		While the author has most to say about parliamen - tary leaders and statesmen , he also has included several interesting chapters on `` cap - tains of the Boer war , '' prominent men of let - ters , and the great leaders in English art .

		The whole is done in the inimitable style of the man who
Balfour	PERSON	once said has `` the secret of making even the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	amus - ing . ''

		But although Sir
Henry	PERSON	has written a most enjoyable book , and one that maintains its interest to the last line , it contains very little important information that is really new , and as a contribution to recent English history its value is very slight .

		218 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 21	DATE	ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .

		In accordance with the long-established custom of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, there is here presented the annual classified list of books announced for fall and winter publication .

		Lifting the Veil The Truth Aboutthe Theater By One of
New York	LOCATION	's Greatest Producers Precisely what the title indicates facts as they are , plain and unmistakable without veneer of any sort .

		It goes directly to the heart of the whole matter .

		Behind the writer of it who is one of the best known theatrical men in
New York	LOCATION	are long years of experi - ence .

		He recites what he knows , what he has seen , and his quiet , calm , authoritative account of conditions as they are is without adorn - ment , excuse or exaggeration .

		It is intended to be helpful to those who want the facts , and for them it will prove of immeasurable value .

		`` The Truth about the Theater , '' in brief , lifts the curtain on the American stage .

		It leaves no phase of the subject untouched .

		To those who are ambitious to serve the theater , either as players or as playwrights , or , again , in some managerial capacity , the book is in - valuable .

		To those , too , who would know more about the theater that they may come to some fair estimate of the worth of the innumerable theories nowadays advanced , the book will again prove its value .

Edward Lucas	PERSON	White One of the greatest semi-historical novels ever written ; a book to rank with The Cloister and the Hearth .

		Laid in
South America	LOCATION	at the beginning of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, the story is woven around the commanding figure of one who was undoubtedly the most remark - able man ever born on the
Western Hemisphere Francia	ORGANIZATION	, the Dictator of
Paraguay	LOCATION	.

		`` El Supremo '' is the most ambitious historical romance yet composed in
North America	LOCATION	.

		The profusion of local color is so woven into the incidents that no part is heavy or slow , and the narrative moves forward without a halt and makes fascinating reading to the end .

		For perhaps the first time in American fiction Spanish-Americans are presented sympathetic - ally , from the point of view of a North American who moves among them but who is not the dominating character of the story .

		In the book is inserted a map of
Asuncion	LOCATION	as it was in
1800	DATE	, and here you can trace the characters of the story as they move through their sun-lit city .

		As
Stevenson	PERSON	wrote `` Treas - ure Island '' about a map that he himself had drawn , so Mr.

		282 About one hundred years ago the poets of
France	LOCATION	were smitten with a devastating disease megalomania .

		They came to feel that the poet is the pinnacle of the social fabric , the flower and crown of God 's crea - tion .

		To
Victor Hugo	PERSON	the poet was half prophet and half mage ; to
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	he was the spokesman of heaven ; to
Alfred de Vigny	PERSON	he was alternately the chosen con - fidant and the enraged antagonist of God .

		These enthusiasts found not even a half-truth in
Malherbe	PERSON	's gruff remark : `` A poet is of about as much use to the
State	ORGANIZATION	as a player of ninepins . ''

		They saw man 's only hope of betterment in a religious attendance upon the divine message of the poet-seer .

		This doctrine of the poet 's message had lived for ages in the world and had done no harm .

		It became pernicious only when sup - ported by that sentimental humanitarianism of the Romantic Era which , like all things sentimental , was egoistic at the core .

		The romantic poet , whether of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, or
England	LOCATION	, cared supremely for himself .

		He used this fiction of an altruistic mission as one of the many veils and disguises in which he cloaked his egoism .

		`` My heart sickens , * ' says de Vigny , `` when I consider how long it takes for the idea of a solitary thinker to penetrate to the hearts of the people . ''

		But what `` idea '' has the lonely Messiah in mind here ?

		He is thinking of his own semi-auto - biographical '' Chatterton . ''

		and fearing that its central theme the brutally stupid treat - ment of genius by envious mediocrity will not make a sufficiently overwhelming effect upon the `` vulgar . ''

		This belief that the poet is God 's messenger to an ignorant and stiff-necked generation filled
Europe	LOCATION	for a time with melancholy , self-immolating Messiahs who naively and quite sincerely gauged their own greatness on the scale of their real or imagined woes .

		It accounts for much of what is saddest and most perplexing in the career of
Shelley	PERSON	and for nearly all that is clearest and most amus - ing in the `` Byron legend . ''

		Yet it was sud - 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
October	DATE	5 denly and almost completely abandoned when it failed any longer to serve the poet 's main purpose of self-aggrandizement .

		Suddenly we are told that art has nothing to do with truth .

		Poetry cedes to science the didactic robe and the prophet 's wand , retaining for itself a purely decorative - function .

		In the years of slack and welter preceding
Tennyson	PERSON	, when the imposing if not always profound philosophies of earlier romanticism were quite abandoned ,
Byron	PERSON	dwindles into
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	declines into Beddoes .

		In place of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's titan fronting an immor - tality of torture to serve mankind a figure which , with all its cloudy grandeur , is only the gigantic portrait of the man of genius as painted by himself upon the sky we get the rather pitiful World-losers and world-forsakers On whom the pale moon gleams of
Arthur O ` Shaughnessy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poet no longer pretends to any desire to uplift humanity .

		Rather , he wishes to crowd it down beneath his own level .

		Contemporaneous with the rise of the middle classes and
Sauerteig	ORGANIZATION	's `` hell of not making money '' was the poet 's hell of not distinguishing himself .

		His best efforts were put forth not in the service of truth , not even in the quest for pure beauty , but pour la gloire , et pour ennuyer les philis - tins .

		He seems to have said to himself , in the words of a recent parodist , Come , my songs , let us sing about something ; It is time we were getting ourselves talked about .

		There needs no digging into the past to show how the poet set about this purely ego - istic task .

		His methods are painfully familiar to readers of contemporary verse .

		To be incomprehensible , he thought in his childlike way , would get him a reputation for profundity .

		To be obscure would be to seem elevated .

		He sought out novel emotions , pas - sions , and ideas in far lands , in abnormal psychology , in strange mixtures and confu - sions of the senses , in strange mixtures and confusions of the arts .

		He ransacked science and magic for bizarre and horrible effects .

		With a diabolic instinct for that which would most bewilder his middle-class audience , he treated vice and immorality in a sympathetic or at least tolerant way .

		He enunciated the sophism , to which his whole attack on the parochial virtues seemed to give the lie , that art has nothing to do Math morality or with truth .

		He invented the poisonous heresy of `` art for art 's sake . '' '

		In his life as in his work , he strove to emphasize the divergence between himself and the common herd .

		He claimed exemption from the duties and responsibilities of civil and domestic life . ''

		To think that the poet should be required to stop in the middle of a stanza . ''

		exclaims
Charles Morice	PERSON	indignantly , `` to go and com - plete his twenty-eight days ' training in the army ! ''

		The poet insisted that genius made laws unto itself .

		He would have his conduct tried by a code of his own framing , very elastic and vague even in his own mind .

		Grocers and mechanics paid their debts , there - fore he would not .

		Artisans and laborers were rational , methodical , law-abiding .

		He would be capricious , spasmodic , riotous .

		More than for anything else he sought for novelty , which he confused with originality and which is as easy to secure as it is trivial and value - less when secured .

		In his search for novelty , he ignored or defied the tradition of his art in theme , manner , and form .

		He had derived from his romantic ancestry the fixed convic - tion that the poet should not know much , that he should be the creature and the prey of emotion , that he should have no theories .

		Grammarians are learned : the poet should be ignorant or at least an obscurantist .


Mathe	PERSON	- maticians use the reasoning faculties : the poet should succumb to rudderless emotion .

		Politicians have theories : the poet should `` write on the lintels of the door post , WHIM . ''

		As a sure receipt for novelty in his art , the poet should be in his own person a creature unprecendented and unique .

		In the fulness of time appeared as a
Paris	LOCATION	- ian poet an astonishingly irrational person who yet had unmistakable genius , a creature who seemed to have in common with normal humanity only the broken body and five senses which he abused , a lecher and vagabond who roused himself between fits of drunken slum - ber to scribble on dirty cafe menu-cards songs ribald and foul or tyrics of the sweetest and most fragile beauty , according as the mood found him .

		For there was room in some quiet and unsullied corner of his heart for an angel that discoursed most excellent music .

		The puddle of filth was clear enough to reflect a star .


Paul Verlaine	PERSON	was the culmination of his type .

		In his generation and after it , debauchery was thought almost as necessary an accompaniment and criterion of genius as
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 249 was mysterious sadness during the reign of Byron .

		The divorce of imagination from reason , the breach between beauty and real - ity , had brought about this result : the fore - most poet in
Paris	LOCATION	was a man who stood in equal need of a hospital , an insane asylum , and a jail .

		Gradually the poet came to realize that he had gone too far .

		After all , his effort had been from the first little more than an elabor - ate posturing before the world a little boy - ish , a little pitiful , more than a little weak .

		From the first , it depended for success upon what the world might think of it .

		The public felt instinctively that true greatness must be broadly based upon a common humanity and that in any poetic message worth attending to we somehow hear the voices of the millions supporting the voice of the one .

		For all the stupidity of which it was accused , the public understood that there was something vaguely wrong with these men who claimed to repre - sent humanity because , forsooth , they were unique .

		Accordingly , the poet discovered , in the midst of his attitudes , that the world was not paying attention .

		The public , that had listened at first with some concern to his tirades of morbid pride and self-pity , looked on with amusement and at last with indiffer - ence as he wandered farther and farther into deliberate eccentricity .

		Finally it went away and ignored him altogether , and he found himself acting before an empty theatre .

		In shuddering chagrin he retired into his palace of art , first to work , then to dream , and finally to weep .

		Then began anew that morbid praise of solitude which seems to be an integral phase of the romantic mood and which usually amounts to a dispraise of society .

		But soli - tude is , in reality , a thing that the egoist can not endure .

		`` He who can bear to live in solitude must be either a wild beast or a god , '' says a wise ancient , and the egoist is neither of these .

		In his apparent and studied indif - ference to opinion , he had increased his dependence upon opinion beyond all bounds .

		And now , in his enforced retirement , there came upon him pessimism , sterility , and dis - gust , indubitable signs of bankruptcy and defeat .

		Here , then , and in something like this way , although the process of course differed widely from one individual and from one nation to another , was completed that breach between the artist and his public which has lasted now for several generations , to the impoverish - ment of art and public alike .

		The poet has suspected something wrong when he has stumbled upon popularity in his own time .

		And he is not entirely in error , for the public has learned to look to science for truth ; from art , like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Theseus , it expects only relaxation and refined amusement .

		The poetry to which it continues to give some yawning attention is likely to be sickly with sentimentality or else a glorification of the obvious domestic virtues , if not of mere vul - garity .

		Unfortunately , our current and popular critical impressions draw from no source more remote than the very movement that has just been hastily traced .

		As a result , the common notion of a poet , even to-day , is that of a pallid , lonely , lugubrious person who neither finds nor seeks a place in active life and who puzzles a preoccupied world with unsolicited exposures of his own strange and recondite woes .

		It requires a literary scholar - ship beyond the ordinary to realize that the important poets of the world have been , with few exceptions , resolute and cheerful souls busily engaged in the common affairs of life , delighting in wholesome relations with real men and women .

		But there is excellent reason to suppose that this fixed conviction of the popular mind no longer holds good .

		This whole teaching and belief that the poet is a very exceptional per - son compact of excellent differences from the mass of men belonged primarily to a school of writers which died out in
France	LOCATION	many years ago .

		In
England	LOCATION	it is dying linger - ingly , with the last of the `` aesthetes . ''

		In
America	LOCATION	, which sometimes seems to be the catch-all of assorted European ideas , it still drags about a crippled , anemic existence .

		A mountain stage-driver once said to me , point - ing to one of the four horses upon which my life depended , `` That there hoss is dead , but he ai n't got sense enough to lay down . ''

		We still have , for our sins , some writers of verse among us who confuse a deliberately erratic individualism with genius and who flaunt their contempt for all forms of restraint under the name of liberty .

		There are not a few who mistake the convulsive throes and death-rattle of the old for the mother-pangs of some wonderful new birth .

		All this has happened before and is easily understood .

		It 250
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
October 5	DATE	can do harm only as it helps to perpetuate among those who should know better a certain intolerance of contemporary poetry .

		The fact is that already certain strong fresh voices , both in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, are beginning to shame the laggards into silence .

		The poetry that really counts to-day and it is certainly not too soon to affirm one 's conviction that there is such a poetry is devoid of shallow egoism .

		It has little of the morbid self-analysis that has poisoned so much poetry of the immediate past at its source .

		It is returning from the novelty - hunting vagaries of other years to the broad C major of our common life .

		Our tardy recognition of this sound and forward-looking poetry is due in no small degree to our lack of a reliable criticism which might have apprised us of its existence .

		For in spite of the still prevalent charge of Alexandrianism against our time , criticism is in a far worse plight with us than poetry .

		On the one hand we are perplexed and antag - onized by a shallow and facile `` appreciation '' that proclaims a masterpiece in three out of every five volumes of verse that fall from the press .

		On the other hand we are chilled and intimidated by a pococurantic criticism which reveals its academic origins in a somewhat supercilious attitude toward the present and which seems convinced , with the melan - choly Frenchman , that `` all the verses are written . ''

		Poet and public get little guid - ance from either .

		Meanwhile , and for the present , the old decadent voices are louder than ever .

		Their swan-song is strangely unmelodious .

		It is difficult indeed to find any promise for the future in the heat and dust of the hour .

		All the more need , then , of a criticism at once sympathetic and rigorous , at once hospitable and sound .

		Granted that criticism of one 's contemporaries is most difficult and hazard - ous , it is far from impossible .

		It provides , indeed , as Sainte-Beuve saw , the supreme test of any critical theory , of any critical powers .

		More than this , it has the great advantage over any criticism of the past that it may make poetry available to the very generation out of which it has grown and to which it is primarily addressed .

		More and more cer - tainly and confidently year by year a few poets , not as yet the greater number or the best known , are doing their part , performing the indispensable service of keeping a-gleam , in a time of terror and eclipse , some light of the ideal .

		Constantly greater , therefore , grows the need of a criticism aware and rev - erent of the old things but fearless and alert to face and greet the new , a criticism able to winnow what is moribund and tottering to its
fall	DATE	from that which is fresh and of the dawn .

		For each age is a dream that is dying Or one that is coming to birth .

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Twenty years ago Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's Biblical story , `` The Brook Kerith , '' would have created an uproar .

		Bishops would have preached sermons against it .

		Town Councils would have passed resolutions excluding it from their libraries .

		Parish priests would have publicly burnt it .

		And all the daily and weekly papers would have been full of con - troversies about it , in which the words `` blas - phemy '' and `` obscurantism '' and the phrases `` defiler of sacred things '' and `` untrammelled freedom of human thought '' would have been worked very hard .

		But twenty years of extravagant language about every established thing in heaven and earth have done their work .

		The bishops stand helpless , like
Virgil	PERSON	's peasant who saw the flood sweeping away trees , animals , and buildings , and refrain , except on rare occasions , from protest .

		`` Un - trammelled freedom , '' in this and most depart - ments of discussion , is enjoyed and sometimes even abused without question ; and Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's engaging theory that our Lord did not die on the Cross but was taken down alive and went into a monastery , whilst St.
Paul	PERSON	built up a church on a monstrous great lie , has been received with lamblike mildness .

		The book , which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	-LRB- let us hope , mendaciously -RRB- says will be his last , is about the most perfectly written of all his works ; but the subject is quietly , almost solemnly , treated ; and even the supreme interests of the events dealt with and the unorthodoxy of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's approach do not make it exciting reading .

		The most striking thing about it is its cover , which looks like the cover of a ledger with a paper label stuck on .

		It is not an altogether successful experiment in binding , but it is at least an experiment , and the publisher has obviously thought about it .

		The binding of ordinary English books is certainly improving , but many English pub - lishers still do not bother about the task of their bindings at all , or else lay themselves
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 251 out to appeal to the vulgarest taste .

		In
America	LOCATION	things appear to me to be , if any - thing , worse .

		Bad colors and debased letter - ing are predominant .

		I got one American novel the other day , the publisher of which had ornamented the cover with huge lower - case letters all tumbling different ways .

		Per - sonally , I should advise every author who is at all concerned about the appearance of his books to thrust his views on his publisher before publication .

		It is very comic to see -LRB- as one often does -RRB- books advocating the regen - eration of public taste , the diffusion of Art , etc. , ete. , coming out in ugly type and within the vilest covers .

		The two most conspicuous novels announced for the autumn are Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's `` The Lion 's Share '' and Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through . ''

		The latter has , I believe , been serialized on your side ; here , it is still running in `` The Nation , '' which , being an ordinary sixpenny weekly , can not give up a great deal of space to each instalment , and has been issuing it for some considerable time .

		But the announcement of the volume shows that Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's efforts to see things through are doomed to failure this journey .

		`` When Mr. `` Wells began the book he may have thought that its termination could be neatly arranged to coincide with the end of Armageddon .

		But though the French general who said that the first five years of the war would be the worst was perhaps unduly pessimistic , it still promises to tax Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's endurance for some time longer ; and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	may , later on , feel called upon to add a sequel , `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Really Does See It Through . ''

		The autumn 's poetry will be more than usually interesting .

		Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , one of the finest of the younger writers , has a new book in the press ; Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	is issuing a volume of selections from his three hundred lyrics .

		And there are at least two interesting volumes of `` Collected Poems . ''

		One will be somewhat small : that of Mr.
Ralph Hodgson	PERSON	, author of `` The Gull '' and `` The Song of Honour . ''

		Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	was the last recipient of the Poliquac Prize , an award of 100 given annually to the writer who has -LRB- in the opinion of the
Academic Committee of the Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	of Literature the nearest thing we have to the French Acad - emy -RRB- written the most promising new book of prose or verse .

		He is a poet of very restricted output , and has only managed to publish a few dozen poems in leisure hours snatched from the cultivation of bull-terriers .

		But almost everything he has done is equal to his best .

		At the end of this month Mr.
Seeker	PERSON	will publish -LRB- I may as well explain that I have edited this volume myself -RRB- the `` Collected Poems '' of the late
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	.

		A friend of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's , Flecker went to both
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, then worked in the Consular service in
Turkey	LOCATION	and
Syria	LOCATION	, and died in
Switzerland	LOCATION	twenty months ago at the age of thirty .

		His was a great loss .

		He combined enthusiasm for life with the most painstaking craftsmanship ; and the degree of promise that his consumption cut short can be perceived by anyone who goes through the poems chronologically and observes the rapid and continuous improvement in technique and strengthening of imagination .

		Some of his poems , such as `` The Golden Journey to
Samarkand	LOCATION	, '' became popular during his life - time ; but the body of good work that he left behind is much larger than is generally known .

		His published works included , besides several books of verse , a novel , some fantastic short stories , a dialogue on education -LRB- called `` The Grecians '' -RRB- , and an Italian grammar .

		A play , `` Hassan , '' and another play on `` Don Juan '' remain unpublished .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is about to issue a long poetical chronicle , `` The Hodjiad , '' which traces the history of the English peasantry from the time when
Britain	LOCATION	first arose from out the azure main until the close of the present war , when the rural soldiers will return from the trenches with a strong con - viction that something ought to be done for them .

		A propagandist conclusion to such a poem may certainly be excused .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, who , unlike many popular novelists , is not content to go on imitating his own past suc - cesses , is also translating the
Iliad	LOCATION	.

		Trans - lating Homer has long been popular with English poets , and even with English politi - cians .

		From
Chapman	PERSON	to
William Morris	PERSON	, scores of men have tried to produce something like the original , and each has done no more than convey some of its aspects to his own contemporaries .

		Pope 's couplets are now as out of fashion as
Cowper	PERSON	's mild Miltonics .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's medium is a very free and elastic blank verse .

		Selecting the nearest thing to an equivalent of the
Homeric Hexameter	ORGANIZATION	is the first and greatest difficulty .

		1 know one man who has been at the Iliad for ten years .

		He started by doing sixteen books in rhymed couplets .

		Then he tore those up and got almost as far in
Dante	LOCATION	's terza rima .

		Then he changed his mind once more , and fell back on blank verse , in which he was still embedded when he last wrote to me .

		Men will go on ; for it seems feeble to have to admit that the best translation of 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	Homer we have is the prose version by
Butcher	ORGANIZATION	,
Lang	PERSON	, and Leaf .

		Possibly there will be less of this transla - tion in the future .

		For it is obvious that after this war the assault on the teaching of Latin and Greek will be resumed .

		The apostles of all the physical sciences are wait - ing to spring .

		We are going to be told louder than ever that chemistry , biology , geology , zoology , morphology , pathology , and the rest of the numerous company -LRB- most of which , by an irony , have Greek names -RRB- are what the modern world requires ; and that the study of humane letters never taught anybody how to make aniline dyes , turbines , Zeppelins , or poison gas .

		It is to be hoped that in the future those who appreciate the value of studies which have some relation to the mind and soul of man will not idiotically concen - trate , as they have so often done in the past , on the mere affirmation of the inestimable value of a compulsory smattering of the clas - sics to the ordinary man .

		If they have any sense they will shift their ground to the much more defensible trenches of history and English literature , recognizing , at the same time , that even the physical sciences -LRB- though they themselves have been in the habit of calling them , generically , `` stinks '' -RRB- have their place in an educational scheme .

		The English are a nation of extremists .


London	LOCATION	,
Sept. 22 , 1916	DATE	.

		J. C. SQUIRE .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		ONE OP THE WORLD 'S GREATEST THINKERS has passed in the death of
Josiah Royce	PERSON	.

		Some of his associates in philosophy called him unreservedly the greatest thinker
America	LOCATION	has produced .


William James	PERSON	referred to him repeatedly as his master , despite his own con - siderable seniority in years , and noted scholars of other lands were glad to sit at his feet .

		The outline of his life his birth in
California	LOCATION	nearly sixty-one years ago , his edu - cation at
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and
Gottingen	LOCATION	, his long ser - vice as teacher of philosophy at
Harvard	LOCATION	, his lectures at home and abroad , and his numer - ous honors from institutions of learning hardly needs rehearsal here .

		The early rip - ening of his genius and the tone of authority that marks even his first books are noteworthy .

		One of
Edward Rowland Sill	ORGANIZATION	's letters of nearly forty years ago makes favorable men - tion of young
Royce	PERSON	, who for a while was assistant to
Sill	ORGANIZATION	in the English department at
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Har - vard , ever on the watch for promising talent in whatsoever quarter , soon called him east - ward , and from that time he rose rapidly to prominence in the world of philosophy , win - ning for himself a foremost place among the exponents of absolute idealism , and of late years commanding a more general hearing by his advocacy of '' loyalty , '' of faithfulness to a high and pure ideal of conduct .

		`` The
Phil	PERSON	- osophy of Loyalty '' is among the best and the most widely read of his books .

		`` War and Insurance , '' written soon after the out - break of hostilities in
Europe	LOCATION	, .

		is his contribu - tion toward the problem created by the immeasurable destructiveness of modern war - fare .

		Other noted works of his are `` The Religious Aspect of Philosophy , '' `` The Spirit of Modern Philosophy '' -LRB- a really entrancing book to the reflective reader -RRB- , `` The World and the Individual , '' `` Studies of Good and Evil , '' and the
Bross	PERSON	lectures on '' The Sources of Religious Insight . ''

		He wrote , too , with admirable sympathy , of his one-time col - league , Professor
William James	PERSON	, and gave in handy form an estimate and a review of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Curiously enough , this thinker whom few among general readers could honestly profess to understand and enjoy , tried his hand at fiction and produced one novel , `` The Feud of
Oakfield Creek	ORGANIZATION	, '' published twenty-nine years ago .

		It is , as it could not have failed to be , logically con - structed and clearly written ; and it is also interesting .

		An early `` History of
California	LOCATION	, '' in the `` American Commonwealths '' series , is another of his works outside the domain of philosophy .

		As a public speaker he never failed to be impressive , and probably his most impressive platform utterance was his late eloquent protest , at
Tremont Temple	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, against the spirit of inhumanity exem - plified in the sinking of the `` Lusitania . ''

		THE CULT OP
WILLIAM BLAKE	PERSON	is so widely at variance , so grotesquely at variance , one might say , with the aims and ideals that seem to be moving the world in this ninetieth year after his death , that attention must be arrested by the recent meeting , at
Brighton	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, of those
Blake	PERSON	enthusiasts who have constituted themselves the
Blake Society	ORGANIZATION	and are doing noble work in trying to keep alive
Blake	PERSON	's spirit and arouse interest in his work as poet , painter , and mystic .

		A clipping from the
Brighton	LOCATION	`` Herald '' comes to hand , through the kindness of a member of the society , with an account of the proceedings at this meeting , including the substance of two addresses , one from the Mayor of
Brighton	LOCATION	, the other from Mr.
J. Foster Howe	PERSON	, a vice
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 253 president of the society .

		A few words from Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's paper , which was the `` feature '' of the occasion , as the reporter would phrase it , may serve to convey something of the spirit of this small but hopeful band of apostles .

		`` In
Blake	PERSON	we see the marvellous powers of the mind exercised not upon mere fanciful subjects of comparative unimportance , such as are ordinarily attributed to the imaginative faculty , but upon the great fundamental realities of life , death , and immortality .

		His mind seems to have been opened in a more than ordinary degree to that which is above and beyond this merely transitory stage of things . ''

		As
Wordsworth	PERSON	once said of him , `` there is something in the madness of this man that interests more than the sanity of Lord
Byron	PERSON	and
Walter Scott	PERSON	. ''

		A reawak - ening of this interest at this time can surely be no cause for regret .

		THE SHAPE OF SHAKESPEARE 'S EARTH is not precisely known .

		Whether he conceived our planet to be a perfect sphere , or an oblate spheroid , or cylindrical in pattern , or of the form of a cheese , who shall say ?

		But he surely was not a believer in a flat earth .

		Yet a few days ago a prominent journal let a charitable silence veil its name printed this astonishing assertion from its
London	LOCATION	literary correspondent : `` Shakespeare believed in a square earth like most of his generation , so far as we know . ''

		But we know very well that
Shakespeare	PERSON	made his Puck promise to `` put a girdle round about the earth in forty min - utes . ''

		Moreover , his contemporary ,
Chapman	PERSON	, used almost the same phrase when he wrote , `` To put a girdle round about the world . ''

		Were they girdling a `` square earth '' in this bit of imagery ?

		Granted that neither
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	nor
Chapman	PERSON	could have known anything about the canals of Mars or the existence of Uranus and
Neptune	LOCATION	, yet that either of them could have conceived of the earth as rectangular almost a century after its first circumnavigation is highly improb - able .

		A SILENT LYRE , too early silent , and not soon to be touched again by so light and sure a hand as that which once swept its strings , is that of
Frank Dempster Sherman	PERSON	, who died on the nineteenth of
September	DATE	in his fifty - seventh year .

		Though the teaching of archi - tecture was the vocation that claimed his more serious attention , it was his avocation as poet that brought him enviable fame .

		His facility and fecundity in light verse assure him a place among those whom he himself has sung , `` the lords of rhyme from
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's down to
Dobson	PERSON	's time . ''

		With
Dobson	PERSON	, of course , rather than with Homer he will be ranked , and there is an unmistakable nearness of kinship between these two masters of the short and graceful lyric .

		Even in his student days at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, as the writer of this well remem - bers ,
Sherman	PERSON	's contributions of verse to his college paper attracted more than local atten - tion ; and it was no surprise to see him after - ward quickly make a name for himself in the larger world with his pen .

		It is strange to relate of one thus gifted that he excelled also as an expert genealogist and as an accom - plished mathematician .

		A fondness for archi - tecture , which he taught at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	for nearly three decades , is easily intelligible in a poet ; but the tracing of pedigrees and the manipulation of numerals do not so manifestly appeal to the poetic imagination .

		Among
Sherman	PERSON	's best-known bits of verse will be recalled the lines beginning , `` Give me the room whose every nook is dedicated to a book '' lines that excellently describe the charms of the library and also , perhaps , the apos - trophe to Fancy , which ends : Is there any magic lure That will win you quick and sure ?

		Is there any fetter strong That will hold you , soul of song ?

		Tell me , Fancy , so that I
May	DATE	not let you slip me by .

		`` THE MANNERLY STEVENSON , '' as Mrs.
Wyatt Eaton	PERSON	says she has heard him called -LRB- see her book , `` A Last Memory of
Stevenson	PERSON	, '' noticed on another page -RRB- , charmed by the very unconventionally of his instinctive gentlemanliness , and demonstrated in his sometimes grotesquely-clad person the truth of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's saying that `` A man by nothing is .

		so well betrayed as by his manners . ''

		Fur - ther particulars of
Stevenson	PERSON	's appearance and bearing are to be noted through Mrs.
Eaton	PERSON	's minutely observing eyes .

		`` His hands - were of the psychic order , and were of marble whiteness , save the thumb and first finger of the right hand , that were stained from con - stant cigarette rolling fot he was an invet - erate smoker and had the longest fingers I have ever seen on a human being ; they were , in fact , part of his general appearance of ^ lankiness , that would have been uncanny , but * for the geniality and sense of bien etre that he gave off .

		His voice , low in tone , had an endearing quality in it , that was almost like a caress .

		He never made use of vernacular - isms and was without the slightest Scotch accent ; on the contrary , he spoke his English like a world citizen , speaking a universal 254 -LSB-
October	DATE	5 tongue , and always looked directly at the per - son spoken to . ''

		Very interesting and unusual , as well as attractive , must have been the combination in
Stevenson	PERSON	of a certain courtliness that bespoke the `` world citizen '' with those opposite characteristics of his that marked the solitary and the dreamer .

		Charm - ing all by his mere presence , he yet avoided society and shrank , not from `` the great unwashed , '' as he was wont to declare , but from `` the great washed . ''

		BOOKSELLING TO LIBEARIES has come to be recognized by the trade as not richly remun - erative in direct returns expressed in dollars and cents , so keen is the librarian in his quest for the very lowest of low competitive prices ; and therefore more than one dealer has ceased to solicit library orders .

		But there are indirect advantages connected with the mod - estly-paid business of catering to libraries .

		Books that would not otherwise pass through the dealer 's hands come into his shop and serve as samples for the securing of many an occasional order that brings him good profit and that would have escaped him under other conditions .

		The librarian , too , is not unwill - ing to turn custom in the direction of one who has served him fairly and honorably in the filling of orders ; and the mere display of current literature on the library shelves serves as an advertisement from which the one who supplied that literature stands a chance of profiting in subsequent private sales .

		Much has been written and still more has been orally uttered on the subject of library book-buying and library discounts , and much more will doubtless be written and uttered ; but not until its recent appearance in the `` Bulletin '' of the
American Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	have we had knowledge of the novel plan by which , if it should go into effect , library orders would be filled by the publisher directly , while he would soothe the feelings of the neglected local bookseller by presenting him with a ten - per-cent commission , if it may be so called , on all such sales .

		The scheme involves obvious difficulties , and there will be no cause for sur - prise if it does not speedily demonstrate its practicability .

		, .

		.

		THE ODIUM OP SELF-APPOINTED CENSORSHIP may and often does more than counterbalance the justness of an adverse criticism , espe - cially when the criticism has to do with the .

		delicate question of decency , or moral purity .

		That we see only what we have eyes to see , that we find in a book only what we find in ourselves , is a truth that may well deter one from advertising one 's discoveries of alleged indecency in a writer 's pages .

		And so it is that the present censorious assaults upon Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	are quite as likely to work injury to the assailants as to Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	; more likely , in fact .

		In a brief and well-con - sidered protest from the Authors ' League against `` the efforts now being made to destroy the work of
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	, '' it may be that these efforts are taken too seriously , and that the fear expressed lest they `` do great damage to the freedom of letters in the
United States	LOCATION	'' is groundless ; but there is some truth in the assertion that `` the method of the attack , with its attempt to ferret out blas - phemy and indecency where they are not , and to condemn a serious artist under a law aimed at common rogues , is unjust and absurd . ''

		A general protest on the part of writers is asked for against `` interference by persons who , by their own statement , judge all books by narrow and impossible stand - ards , '' and a plea is made for `` such amend - ments to the existing laws as will prevent such persecutions in future . ''

		Mr.
Harold Hersey	PERSON	, 33 West 42d Street ,
New York	LOCATION	, is sending out copies of this protest for signature by American writers .

		After all , there is a humorous aspect to this whole affair , serious though it be in the eyes of the Authors ' League ; and Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	will not be the last person to see it .

		His books are receiving the best imaginable free advertising , as his next semi-annual check for royalties will very agreeably prove to him .

		WHERE `` RAMONA '' is THE MOST POPULAR NOVEL need not puzzle any reader of the book to determine very quickly .


California	LOCATION	, the scene of the romance , is naturally the region where its hold on readers shows least sign of slackening .

		At
Redlands	LOCATION	, for example , a city of about ten thousand inhabitants , it requires fifteen or more copies of the book to supply the constant demand at the public library .

		We say advisedly `` fifteen or more , '' for though fifteen have been bought by the library , the librarian reports the book scarcely ever `` in , '' and four copies have been read to pieces and thrown away .

		This excellent romance , it is further announced by the same authority , is now going -LRB- or already has gone -RRB- to press for its seventy-seventh edition , which means that it has run through an average of more than two editions each year since its .

		first appearance thirty - three years ago ; and the number of copies put into circulation reaches the grand total of three million eight hundred thousand .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 255 COMMUNICATIONS .

		MR.
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	'S NEW CHRIST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Three questions are involved in the case of `` The Brook Kerith , '' by Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, so intelli - gently and presciently reviewed in your latest issue .

		First , is it defensible as art to seize upon an historical character of high importance and deliberately to transform that character ?

		So much as this is true that the Jesus of the New Testament is not the Jesus of this piece of literary work .

		The motives involved in this falsification are so obvious and so reprehensible as to create at once a prejudice against the fabrication .

		And a preju - dice against anything assuming to be an art-prod - uct is evidence against its claims to merit .

		It is bad enough to seize upon an historical character and then for the purposes of fiction to set forth its logical development outside the realm of reality .

		But this is another case .

		The second question raised by the novel is whether or not an offense has been committed against the truth .

		If Jesus as presented in the New Testament is not essential truth , then
Chris	PERSON	- tianity is false and should perish ; for in any warfare between a religion and truth , the religion must and should fail .

		But by various devices aiming at verisimilitude , the novelist in `` The Brook Kerith '' assumes the falsity of the ancient documents , thereby begging the question involved .

		Now this question happens to be a critical one to individuals and to mankind ; for if the Jesus of the Scriptures is essentially false , then every part of the Christian civilization founded upon this falsity must ultimately fail .

		The tremendous import of this proposition is such as to lift it out of the field of fiction into that of science in its most serious mood .

		This reflection forces one into the disposition to inquire whether the novelist is intellectually competent for the task assumed .

		It takes more than even Odysseus to bend this bow .

		We are now asking once more : Which is more incompre - hensible , that some writers should have invented Jesus or that he was what he said he was ?

		Here opens the twenty-centuries controversy , into which Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	has thrown his frail contribu - tion .

		The third question is , why any novelist should consider the religious mind as fair game .

		The orthodox believer , for whatever reason , from whatever instinct , in whatever his circumstances of life , is a very familiar figure because of his compounding of the apparently diverse qualities of positive convictions and of quick and often extreme sensitiveness .

		The one result of such a novel is to harden his heart against all novels , good and bad .

		There are millions of Christian believers who never open a novel because they fear to come upon things of this kind .

		Thereby the market for novels is greatly limited ; and what is far worse , many a truly great and good book goes unread by the orthodox .

		Unreasonable ?

		Not in the .

		least .

		There are tens of thousands of good books not novels .

		Not only so , but a very large number of orthodox believers who will never read novels are readers of more or less scientific books that search the foundations of Christianity .

		A serious man inquiring for truth has a dignity whence he derives the right to be considered .

		But the man of imagination and sentiment invading carelessly and wantonly a world beyond his range and powers can but bring his own performances into such questions as are here raised .

		The person of Jesus is no more available prop - erty for inventive novel-writing than is a cathedral a suitable theatre for vaudeville .

		And the novel - producer who does not see this is as much to be pitied as is the man who is color-blind in a world of beauty .

		It may be assumed that the kind of `` discussion '' proper to your columns should be postulated upon the literary treatment of subjects rather than upon the subjects themselves , historical , philosophical , or political .

		But where a critic takes occasion to use an author 's text for the enforcement of his own views upon a tremendous practical issue , it may be permitted , perhaps , in the way of dissem - inating `` information '' another specification of your programme to point out how the views of the author and his critic are actually being pro- moted .

October	DATE	5 approval of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and his reviewer in our propaganda of `` free exchanges '' as the best basis of world peace .

		Leaders in the nations now engaged in the great European war have lately put forth certain schemes for new tariff enactments , or business international boycotts , to be brought into force after the close of the war , thus inaugurating a great economic struggle , involving losses and dis - asters which might in the end prove to be greater than those that have resulted from the conflict of arms .

		On the contrary , we should look forward to the evolution of a real international spirit .

		The governments of the world are increasingly coming under the control of the peoples them - selves , and these peoples must be aroused to a sense of the truth that their interests , their wel - fare , and their safety can be secured only through civilized international relations .

		The settlement that will bring about an - assured peace will not be secured through the action of the rulers or of ' `` empire-builders . ''

		It must be the work of repre - sentatives of the people , of upholders of demo - cratic principles , of men ready to work for the service of mankind .

		Here is a plain duty , to arouse public opinion in the
United States	LOCATION	in support of the contention that protection is itself a form of war , that war brings about an extreme application of .

		protection , and that freedom of trade constitutes an essential factor towards secur - ing and maintaining the peace of the world .

		Thus may our influence and our example be utilized , In the settlement that is to follow this war , towards .

		breaking down the ; protective barriers between nations , barriers which do so much to create prejudice and to bring about the irritations that have too often resulted in war .

		The fullest possi - ble interchange between peoples of the world , not only of goods but of ideas , ideals , and human sympathy , constitutes the essential foundation for such a world 's federation as is the hope of all who are striving for the higher principles of civilization and of humanity .

		BY VIRTUE OF FORM ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
August 15	DATE	, Mr.
H. E. Warner	PERSON	comes to the conclusion that free verse is prose , `` generally speaking , spite of protest , '' and that '' `` poetry , good or bad , is poetry by virtue of its form , '' by which he apparently means the rhymed stanza form .

		He slides over the blank-verse diffi - culty by remarking that `` blank verse is the easiest of all , and except in a few hands , the least satis - factory . ''

		`` Rhyme adds wonderfully to the effect and also to the difficulty .

		It is a dull ear , never - theless , that does not find an increase of beauty in this complexity , '' etc. .

		It is useless to argue with a critic of this sort .

		If poetry is such by virtue of its form , primarily , and if the complexity of the form means an increase of beauty , then de
Banville	PERSON	's pantoums and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's double ballades are the highest poetry we possess .

		And if the sonnet is a `` form of intrinsic beauty , '' `` a gem not a prize squash , '' why is it that in the next breath , Mr.
Warner	PERSON	admits that the perfect sonnet does not exist ?

		No sane architectural critic would dare to sug - gest that because of ` its wonderful complexity of pattern designing , the
Alhambra	LOCATION	was the finest building in the world ; no musical critic would hold
Josquin	PERSON	des Pres the greatest of composers , because he wrote double canons and triple fugues ; no critic of painting would hold that a Persian enamelled tile was better art than
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's `` Bacchanal . ''

		Are we to apply the same standard to poetry that has been applied to other arts for centuries ?

		or are we to go on classifying poetry as something artificial , remote , useless , and diffi - cult , like chess-playing ?

		I pass over Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's feeble attempt to analyze the substance of certain vers libre poets , and once again , come to grips with him on this matter of form .

		Like all critics of his stamp , he tries the well-worn device of printing poetry as prose , and prose as poetry , declaring that the lines in each case might be variously divided .

		Here is another case of the same thing in which similarly , as he might say , the lines can be divided variously : The barge she sat in , like a burnished throne , burned on the water ; the hoop was beaten gold , purple the sails , and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them , the oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amourous of their strokes .

		For her own person , it beggared all descrip - tion ; she did lie in her pavilion cloth-of - gold of tissue o ` er picturing that
Venus	PERSON	where we see the fancy outwork Nature ; on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling cupids with divers - colored fans , whose wind did seem to glow the deli - cate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid , did .

		Will Mr.
Warner	PERSON	please answer plainly the plain question : Is that prose , or poetry ?

		The author 's recent death at nearly eighty years of age has helped to draw attention to these diverting volumes , in which so many of the titled and famous of his time give distinction as well as animation to his pages .

		Leaving to the curious in such matters the details of ancestry , of pedigree , of family history , with which the opening chapter deals , let us pass at once to the store of anecdote , historic , diplomatic , political , literary , and of many other kinds , constituting the bulk of the work .

		Versatility speaks in every chap - ter ; for Lord Redesdale was an author , a musician , an art connoisseur , a traveller , a big-game hunter , at one time an enviably successful horse-racer -LRB- if one 's envy turn in that direction -RRB- , and long a leader in
London	LOCATION	society , besides being versed in the secrets of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	and in the subtleties of diplomacy .

		A seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	and vari - ous high offices at home came to him , or were won by him , in addition to his appointments at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	,
Pekin	LOCATION	, and Tokio .

		Above all .

		he shows a gift of more than casual obser - vation , an alertness to many sorts of signifi - cant occurrences by the way .

		a receptivity to manifold impressions , and a remarkably retentive memory .

		It was only near the end of his life that he began to record his recol - lections , but with rapid and seemingly not inaccurate pen he fills two large volumes with an uninterrupted succession of more or less minute details .

		He gives point to his nar - rative , too , with many an apt and ready quotation or allusion both from classic and modern sources .

		That he was a good classical scholar is to be inferred not only from his own writings but also from a commendatory word quoted , with justifiable satisfaction , from Dean
Gaisford	PERSON	.

		Of this
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	dignitary he pre - sents us an imposing picture in a few pen - strokes .

		Dean Gaisfor < l was a great potentate : not only was his scholarship superb , but he was also a ruler of men .

		When he nodded ,
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	trembled .

		When he stood up at the altar in
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	and MEMORIES .

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		thundered out the first Commandment , with a long pause after the `` I '' and a strong insistence on the `` Me , '' he would look round the cathedral sternly , as much as to say , `` I should like to see the undergrad - uate , or the graduate either , for that matter , who will dare to dispute that proposition . ''

		His famous utter - ance in a sermon , `` St.
Paul	PERSON	says , and I partly agree with him , '' has become a classic .

		But he was like the Nasmyth Hammer : he could crush a rock or flatten out a rose-leaf .

		Jelf had a good story of the way in which he once petrified a very young Don who at one of his dinners ate an apple in a way which he did not consider to be quite orthodox .

		Something approaching intimacy marked the relations between
Lord Redesdale	ORGANIZATION	and the late
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	, which will account for the considerable space devoted to that sovereign 's sayings and doings in the nobleman 's book .

		`` My recollection of the
King	LOCATION	, which I wish to place on record , '' he says in one place , `` is that of a character made up of various qual - ities a monarch deeply impressed with the duties and obligations of his exalted station ; a man intensely human , and , let his critics say what they will , altogether lovable . ''

		Sig - nificant at this time is the author 's remem - brance of
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	's agitation upon hear - ing of
Austria	LOCATION	's annexation of
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	, in
1908	DATE	, in violation of the Treaty of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The King had only recently visited the Austrian Emperor at
Ischl	LOCATION	, where the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	had been discussed with apparent frankness and intimacy , and there had been a most friendly parting , with full assurance on the side of the departing guest that no cloud lurked on the horizon .

		But , as the writer proceeds , Now , without a word of warning , all was changed .

		The King was indignant , for nobody knew better than he did the danger of tampering with the pro- visions of the Treaty of
Berlin	LOCATION	, and he saw that to make any change in the Turkish provinces was to light a fuse which , sooner or later , was bound to fire a powder magazine .

		Personally , the
King	PERSON	felt that he had been treacherously deceived .

		His fore - cast of the danger , which he communicated at the time to me , showed him to be possessed of that pre - vision which marks the statesman .

		Every word that he uttered that day has come true .

		As the author observes in the next paragraph , the
King	PERSON	recognized his limitations as a con - stitutional ruler ; it was not for him to start alliances , but he could make them possible .

		`` There were Ministers before his time ; could they have removed obstacles and softened asperities as he did ?

		He knew , moreover , that no Sovereign , no Government , could utter a command like that of the first day of creation : ' Let there be peace . '

		He knew that he must work for it , and he did incessantly .

		To the world ' s sorrow another monarch in another country has said .

		` Let there be war ! '

		and there was war . ''

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	An acquaintance with
Carlyle	PERSON	extending `` from before
1850	DATE	to the time of his death '' has contributed something , but not so much as could be wished , to the book 's collection of pen portraits .

		Mention is made of the well-known
Carlyle	PERSON	peculiarities , and the attractive qualities are affectionately dwelt upon .

		`` He did not suffer fools gladly , '' the author admits , `` and he could not brook being lionized , but during all the years that I knew him .

		.

		he was always kind to everybody with whom I saw him kind and , in his rough way , considerate ... I have walked with him and sat with him by the hour , with - out hearing him say an ill-natured word of man or woman . ''

		Of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	not quite so pleasing a picture is painted .

		Though it is denied emphatically that she was in the least jealous of
Lady Ashburton	LOCATION	, it is asserted that `` there was something else of which the lady was jealous , and that was the agony of concentration which her husband 's work meant for him .

		At moments her sceva indig - natio against ` that
Carlyle	PERSON	, ' as she would somewhat contemptuously call him , passed all bounds . ''

		An example follows , which , as it is given on another 's authority , may perhaps safely be taken with modifications : One day my aunt went to call upon her and found her in one of her tantrums what was the matter , she asked .

		`` Oh , my dear , it 's just that
Carlyle	PERSON	!

		Would you believe it , I have had a headache for three days , and he 's only just found it out .

		` I 'm afraid you 're not quite well , my dear , ' he said and all the time he has been working , working !

		I just threw a tea-cup at his head . ''

		Petruchio had a bad time of it that day .

		Exaggeration , so inevitable in gossip , must have colored this anecdote .

		Perhaps Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	was moved to exclaim , `` I could have thrown a tea-cup at his head , '' but any such actual passage of table-ware is inconceivable .

		So too is the alleged occurrence that immedi - ately follows , which will be found on page 653 of the second volume , but is hardly quotable in this place .

		Here is a passing sketch of
Browning	PERSON	, lover of music , and maker of music in verse , but strangely unmusical in vocal utterance : He was very pleasant and agreeable , handsome in a rather leonine way , but his conversation lost some of its charm owing to his rasping , grating voice .

		I once heard him read one of his poems , `` The Eide to Ghent , '' at the house of Lady
Stanley of Alderly	ORGANIZATION	.

		There were only about a dozen people present ; it was not a pleasing performance ; the effect of the poetry was marred by that hoarse croak , like that of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	's raven , and though he read with intense emotion he failed to touch .

		Had he pos - sessed the attraction of a musical speaking voice he would have been irresistible .

		A visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1873	DATE	fills two chapters of some length , in which a buffalo-hunt and the vastness of the great West receive espe - cial emphasis , with considerable attention given to
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	and the Mormons .


Russia	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	furnish their expected liberal supply of interesting matter to the book , some of the author 's best years having been spent in his country 's service in those distant lands .

		Here is his presentation of the Mikado of half a century ago , an appar - ition destined ere long to fade in the rapid encroachment of occidental upon oriental manners and customs : He was dressed in a white coat with long padded trousers of crimson silk trailing like a lady 's court - train .

		His head-dress was the same as that of his courtiers , though as a rule it was surmounted by a long , stiff , flat plume of black gauze .

		I call it plume for want of a better word , but there was nothing feathery about it .

		His eyebrows were shaved off and painted in high up on the forehead ; his cheeks were rouged and his lips painted with red and gold .

		His teeth were blackened .

		It was no small feat to look dignified under such a travesty of nature ; but the sangre azul would not be denied .

		Lord Redesdale 's `` Memories '' is a book without rancor , as such a book ought to be ; but its judgments of men , while charitable , necessarily have something of that personal prejudice without which any collection of memoirs would be in danger of insipidity .

		With
Gladstone	PERSON	's name the author couples `` the unhappy dislocation caused by his Irish policy , '' and adds : `` It has taken forty-four years to show the full value of the theft of
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	.

		What will be said of Home Rule forty-four years hence ?

		Let us pray ! ''

		Portraits and other illustrations play their customary welcome part in these vol - umes , which contain many a spare half-hour of good reading if their bulk should deter from consecutive perusal a treatment of books that many , including Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, have scouted as an excess of obsequious defer - ence .

		A STOREHOUSE OF MYTHOLOGY .

		* There are few subjects upon which more learning has been expended by scholars of distinction than that of mythology .

		Conjec - tures in regard to the origins and distribution of myths have given rise to numerous theories both startling and fascinating .

		Many of these scholars have been possessed by a preconceived idea , which led each one to THE MYTHOLOGY OF ALL RACES .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 259 explain all myths by his own especial for - mula .

		The Solar School , and the
Anthropo	PERSON	- logical School , for example , with
Max Miiller	PERSON	and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	as their respective leaders , waged great intellectual battles , each insist - ing upon the paramountcy of its own explana - tion .

		In the midst of the battle , Sir
James G. Frazer	PERSON	, like the dog in the nursery tale , carried off the bone with his tree and vegeta - tional hypothesis .

		But the bone did not remain long in his sole possession , for to-day the survey of the whole field of mythology perceives that every scholar has a right to his nibble at the bone , and that each one has evolved a theory which explains one or more elements in the origins and growth of myth .

		The task now before the scholar is to make these various theories fit into some general scheme .

		In the meantime , lay readers , for the most part unconscious of the profound interest taken by men of learning in the early thoughts and imaginings of the human race , have read myths , or rather mutilations of myths , simply because they found them interesting as stories .

		When one considers the vast amount of expert knowledge which has been for years accumulating about the myths of all races , it would seem as if the appropriate moment had arrived for the initiation of the general reader into a deeper and more widespread understanding of mythology as a cultural study , recording the religious , scientific , and imaginative development of the human mind .

		The art and literature of the world can not be properly comprehended without a knowledge of Culture Mythologies ; while in primitive myths , the beginnings of religious aspiration , scientific method , and philosophical conjecture are found .

		Primitive man had as strong a desire to know the causes of things as has the scientist to-day .

		Observation , curiosity about the things observed , a wish to control natural forces , aided by a most astonishing imagination , led on the one hand to myths of explanation , and on the other to ceremonies in sympathetic magic ; and from these grew primitive religion , literature , and art .

		To know the story of the development of myths is to know the first chapter in sociology and psychology , a chapter rich in a strangeness and variety , arousing wonder and admiration hardty to be called forth by any subsequent chapter in human development .

		It is a source of genuine satisfaction , there - fore , that , under the general editorship of Dr.
Louis Herbert Gray	PERSON	, one who is thoroughly equipped in this field , a comprehensive work upon the `` Mythology of All Races '' has been undertaken , and is now issuing from the press .

		This work will be completed in thirteen vol - umes , five of which are to be ready by
Decem	PERSON	- ber of this year .

		The thoroughness of the survey and the assurance of scholarly and authoritative work are evidenced in the titles of the volumes , and the names of their respec - tive authors .

		The first volume , on Greek and Roman Mythology , is by Professor
W. Sherwood Fox	PERSON	, of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second volume , devoted to Teutonic Mythol - ogy , is by Dr.
Axel Olrik	PERSON	, of the
University of Copenhagen	ORGANIZATION	, author of `` The Epic Poetry of

		The third volume is divided between Celtic and Slavic : Canon
John A. MacCulloch	PERSON	, Rector of
St. Saviour	ORGANIZATION	's , Bridge of
Allan	PERSON	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and author of `` The Childhood of Fiction , '' etc. , writes on the Celtic Myths ; and the Slavic section is written by Professor
Jan Machal	PERSON	, of the
Bohemian University of Prague	ORGANIZATION	, the author of important works on Slavic Mythology which have never been translated .

		In the fourth volume , Dr.
Uno Holmberg	PERSON	, of the
University of Finland	ORGANIZATION	, writes of the Finno-Ugric and
Siberian Mythology	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifth volume , on Semitic Mythology , is by Captain
R. Campbell Thompson	PERSON	, the author of several well known works upon Oriental mythological subjects .

		The sixth volume is divided between
India	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	, the first being dealt with by Professor
A. Berriedale Keith	PERSON	, of
Edinburgh University	ORGANIZATION	, author of the `` Vedic Index of Names and Subjects , '' and the second by Professor
A. J. Carnoy	PERSON	of the
University of Louvain	ORGANIZATION	, author of the `` Religion of the Avesta '' and other works .

		The seventh vol - ume includes Armenian Mythology , by Pro- fessor
Neardiros Anani Kian	PERSON	, of the
Kennedy School of Missions	ORGANIZATION	, and the Mythology of the Pagan Africans by
George Foucart	PERSON	, head of the
French Institute of Oriental Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	at

		Chinese Mythology , by Professor
U. Hattori	PERSON	of the
Imperial University of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	, and Japanese Mythology by Professor

University of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	, make up the eighth volume .

		The ninth volume , by Professor
Roland Burrage Dixon	PERSON	of Har -
vard University	ORGANIZATION	, author of `` Maidu Texts , '' discusses the Mythology of the
Nealayo	PERSON	- Polynesian and Australian peoples .

		The tenth and eleventh volumes treat of North American , Central and South American Indian Mythology , and both are by Professor
Hartley B. Alexander	PERSON	, of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, author of numerous articles on the American Indians .

		The twelfth volume includes ancient Egyptian Mythology by Pro- 260 THE DIAL -LSB-

Max Miiller	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, author of `` Egyptological Researches , '' etc. , and the Mythology of
Burma	LOCATION	,
Siam	LOCATION	, and
Annam	LOCATION	, by Sir
George Scott	PERSON	, editor of `` The Upper
Burma Gazet	LOCATION	- teer . ''

		Much of this material as for example , the mythologies of the Slavs , the Armenians , the Australians , and the Siberians will come before English readers for the first time .

		In planning this set of books , the authors and publishers have had in mind both the needs of the general reader who is awaking to the importance of a more unified study of mythology , and those of the student .

		The general reader will find in the body of the text a broad survey of `` simple facts '' as they have been presented chiefly by travellers , missionaries , and anthropologists .

		The inten - tion , as outlined by Dr.
Gray	PERSON	in his preface , is not to bring forward any special theory of mythology which seeks to solve every problem by one and the same formula , but to give the facts in the case , leaving the theories to take care of themselves , as they can safely be trusted to do when built upon solid founda - tions ; and yet so to relate the different vol - umes that they will not form a chance collection of monographs , but an organic whole .

		The work aims to be scientific in the best sense , and at the same time eminently readable , `` to set forth myths as living entities , and , because each writer knows and loves the mythology of which he treats , to fill the reader with enthusiasm . ''

		Further - more , as Dr.
Gray	PERSON	expresses it , `` there will be nothing in our series that can be , in Roman Catholic phrase , ' offensive to pious ears . ' ''

		The student will find information of a tech - nical nature in copious notes at the end of each volume , a bibliography of the works consulted in the preparation of the volume , and in the thirteenth volume an Index , pre - pared by the Editor , which will give not merely the names and subjects discussed in the various volumes , but also a topical arrangement by which variant myths and mythic themes of the different peoples may be found readily and accurately .

		The plan is , on the whole , an excellent one .

		It will be recognized at once , however , that the value of the work to scholars will be somewhat discounted by the consideration accorded to `` pious ears . ''

		On the other hand , the scholar will not be harmed by dwelling upon the more beautiful consummations of primitive imagination ; while the general reader will find only what will delight and stimulate him .

		It was no doubt also a sensi - ble determination that no preconceived the - ories were to be adopted in the interpretation of myth .

		But it may be said that the day of a `` single key to all the mythologies '' has passed away with the passing of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's Casauban .

		In a general sense , the various collaborators may be able to live up to the determination of presenting `` mere facts , '' but it is doubtful whether any genuine scholar in mythology can be wholly satisfied with mere description .

		If he ventures upon any interpretation whatever , it must be colored by his own or received theories in regard to origins , variations , and distributions .

		Nor would such coloring of fact detract in the least from the interest felt by the general reader .

		Rather would it help to coordinate and fix in his mind the knowledge he has gained , and indicate to him the true value of mythology in mind-development .


Fortun	PERSON	- ately , each author is given full latitude to plan and arrange his own section ; and we confidently prophesy that the presentation of `` mere facts '' will be enriched by much inter - esting interpretation in line with the most advanced scholarship .

		Indeed , the prophecy is already fulfilled in the first volume to appear , that on `` North American Mythol - ogy , '' by Dr.
Hartley Burr Alexander	PERSON	.

		In his Introduction , Professor
Alexander	PERSON	has passed in review the sources of primitive inspiration , all of which once belonged in the region of the hypothetical conjectures of scholars .

		These are the suggestions of envir - oning nature , the analogies of human nature , both psychical and physiological , imagination and borrowings .

		Enlarging upon these sug - gestions , he gives a most interesting and com - prehensive sketch of the general character - istics of
North American Mythology	ORGANIZATION	, in the course of which he touches upon many of the theories which have been advanced .

		In Professor
Alexander	PERSON	's opinion a distinc - tion must be made between myth and religion proper ; though intimately related , they are not identical .

		`` The Indian 's religion , '' he tells us , `` must be studied in his rites , while many mythic heroes are not important in ritual at all . ''

		Myths , he declares , belong more properly to the realm of science and aesthetics than to that of religion , or , as he , continues , myths detailing causes , so being related to science in its infancy , are `` perhaps the only stories that may properly be called myths . ''

		It may be questioned whether the `` search for the cause '' is not the chief under - lying element in both religion and science , one differentiating through various stages in which magic plays a part into ceremonies for the honor or propitiation of the cause ; the other through magic also into ceremonies for
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 261 the control of the cause .

		Imagination , color - ing every stage , finally breaks loose and works solely on its own account .

		Then we leave the purely aesthetic myth , in which , however , are survivals of the previous stages .

		Why are they not all mythology in different phases of growth ?

		Professor
Alexander	PERSON	himself proves the impossibility of getting away from religion when writing on mythology , for he constantly describes the gods of the different Indian tribes , which descriptions he evidently derives from both ritual and explanatory myths .

		It is a matter of some regret to the reviewer that Professor
Alexander	PERSON	does not give in his Introduction a detailed account of animism and its relations to clan totemism and per - sonal totemism or guardian spirits ; also , of the practices of sympathetic magic , even if some points here are still in the `` precon - ceived idea '' stage .

		Certainly primitive civili - zation based upon these ideas underlies the mythology of the savage , just as surely as our civilization to-day underlies all our liter - ature .

		One already possessed of the knowl - edge feels everywhere in the description and myths the prevailing influence of animism ; yet it is nowhere expressly dealt with except in a short note .

		Again , totemism is only men - tioned expressly in the text in connection with the Indians of the
North Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, though there are a few references to it in the notes .

		These omissions from the Introduction may be due , as already hinted , to the fact that many points in regard to these subjects are still in the controversial stage , and the author may therefore have decided that it would be better to refer to them only in connection with the separate descriptions in the body of the text , generally under other terms .

		Or it may be due to the fact that Professor
Alexander	PERSON	seems to be especially interested in the cosmic and geographical aspects of myths .

		This brings us to the body of the text , which shows an amazing knowledge of the myths , especially the cosmogonic and hero types , of the North American Indian .

		The influence of geographical situation and climate is every - where traced ; and comparisons of the myths of different regions are made , bringing out the similarities and variations .

		Many curious parallels are also drawn between American myths and those of classical antiquity .

		Professor
Alexander	PERSON	has certainly fulfilled with conspicuous success the task he set for himself .

		that is , `` a kind of critical recon - struction of a North American Mythology . ''

		This was an immensely difficult task . ''

		Beliefs vary from tribe to tribe , even from clan to clan ; yet throughout , if one 's attention be broadly directed there are fundamental simi - larities and uniformities that afford a basis '' for such a reconstruction .

		No single tribe and no group of tribes has completely expressed this mythology much less has any realized the form ; but the student of Indian lore can scarcely fail to become con - scious of a coherent system of myths , of which the Indians themselves might have become aware in course of time if the intervention of Old World ideas had not confused them .

		All who read the book will feel that , for the first time , they truly know the North American Indian in all his fantasticalness and in all his profundity .

		Under divisions treating of such tempting subjects as `` The Great Spirit , '' `` The Deluge , '' `` The Theft of Fire , '' `` Tricksters and Wonder Folk , '' `` Spirits , Ghosts , and Bogies , '' `` Prophets and Ghost Dances , '' `` Sun Worship , '' besides the cosmogonic myths of Algonquians ,
Athapascans	LOCATION	,
Iroquoian	LOCATION	,
Pueblo	LOCATION	, Zuni , and many others , will be found a rich mine of Indian lore , made especially valuable both to ordinary readers and to the student by the illuminating observations and interpre - tations of the author .

		The notes at the end add much valuable information on technical points , with references to their sources , and , with the full bibliography and map of the distribution of American linguistic stocks , add scholarly weight to the volume .

		A word should be said of the admirable scheme of illustration , which aims to include pictures of deities or of mythic incidents as delineated by the people who themselves believed in those deities or incidents .

		In the volume before us the illustrations are full of interest , not only for the light they throw upon the text , but for their intrinsic signifi - cance and the excellence of their reproduction .

		Good paper , large and handsome type , and substantial binding in brown buckram lend their aid to the permanent value of the series .

		Publishers and authors alike are to be con - gratulated upon this brilliant inaugural vol - ume , which in constructive interpretation and fascinating information more than ful - fills the promises of its author and the general edltor <

		262 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	THE IiIFE-STORY OF A REFORMER .

		* It has been a matter of common knowledge that Mrs.
Mary Fels	PERSON	had no need to shine in the reflected light of her altogether unique husband , but that she is in a very real sense what the astronomers call `` self-luminous . ''

		If proof of this were required , it is given conclusively in her book recently published , ``
Joseph Fels	PERSON	: His Life-Work . ''

		It would be difficult to over-praise this biography as an achievement in that most delicate of the fine arts , the art of literary portrait-painting .

		When the subject and author stand to each other in the relationship of husband and wife , it can be no easy task to subordinate the part of lover and companion to that of the impar - tial biographer ; but this Mrs.
Fels	PERSON	has accom - plished with signal success , and has presented a portrait which will be universally accepted as a faithful and life-like memorial of one who may well be regarded as typical of all that is best in the progressive spirit of our seething times .

		Mrs.
Fels	PERSON	has painted with a full brush , a firm hand , a delicate sense of color , high lights , and shadows ; yet with a certain reserve and restraint that go far to contribute to the charm of the book .

		We are not troubled with that undue attention to detail which is so common a weakness in those biographies in which the affections are deeply engaged ; and the breadth of treatment is such as to satisfy the most impressionistic of literary tastes .

		The knowledge and under - standing of the underlying principles of political economy displayed by the author hold the reader 's attention from beginning to end ; and the various phases in the evolution of Mr.
Fels	PERSON	's attitude towards the social prob - lem , showing the transition from the platform of the philanthropist to that of the apostle of liberty , are presented in their proper order .

		Accepting the Carlylean dictum that uni - versal history is at bottom the history of the great men who have descended among us , and that `` if we could see them well we should get some glimpses into the very marrow of the world 's history , '' then we can not have too many biographies of the sort we now so heartily welcome .

		For it is only through a clear comprehension of the psychological and spiritual forces latent and active in our great men and women , especially those of revolu - tionary tendencies , that we can rightly under - stand the essential nature of the society that produced them and their probable reaction upon that society .

		conditions under which he lived and worked , particularly of the new-world conditions pre - vailing in the
United States	LOCATION	, we can not doubt .

		No other time could have evolved him , and probably no other country than
America	LOCATION	as it has been during the last few decades .

		His life shows in macrocosm the same features exhibited by the corporate life of the Amer - ican people in macrocosm , the seemingly incongruous combination of practicality with idealism , the healthy boyish delight in the great game of business for its own sake , the frankly-admitted shrewdness in the driving of bargains , the underlying sense of justice and fair-play that refuses to blind itself to the fact that the scales are somehow loaded in his favor and against the losers in the game , the experimental and futile attempts to dis - cover and remedy this bias in the balance of economic forces , in all these experiences we trace a similarity to the course through which the collective mind of the nation is slowly threading its way .

		And herein lies the value of such lives , that in them the larger world sees itself reflected .

		In so far as they have failed to solve the sphinx 's riddle , society is warned ; in so far as they have succeeded , society is encouraged ; but , more important than all , through them the inextinguishable spark of hope is fanned into a flame , and a faith in the principle of progress and the justice of the eternal order takes the place of that pessimism which pictures our present society as rushing headlong to chaos and destruction , like the fate that physicists tell us .

		awaits the planet when the centrifugal forces shall have worn themselves out and nothing hinders our precipitate plunge into the fires of the sun .

		A life of incessant action must necessarily be full of dramatic interest ; and when a man 's activities , though running counter to all the conservative forces of his age and sympathetically to that tide of aspiration which is each generation 's witness to the per - sistence of the will-to-live , are supported by the kudos which wealth brings and the respect which intellect and altruism always command , he inevitably attracts from all classes of society those whose spirits vibrate to the same rhythm .

		Thus we feel no surprise at the intimate friendships formed by Mr.
Fels	PERSON	with
Henry George	PERSON	and
Tom L. Johnson	PERSON	in Amer - ica ; and with
Keir Hardie	PERSON	,
General Booth	ORGANIZATION	,

		`` The American who came interfering in the domestic affairs of

1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 263 for reform , to enlighten it as to the meaning of freedom , and to liberate it from the mental thraldom induced by centuries of habituation to hereditary aristocracies .

		It is not easy for Americans to realize the strange feeling of partly pleased , partly alarmed , surprise with which Englishmen regarded the appearance of a land-reformer exhibiting not a vestige of that traditional respect for the titles and symbols of nobility which has woven itself into the warp and woof of the British mind ; who could write an open letter to the
Duke of Montrose	ORGANIZATION	as from one exploiter of industry to another , reminding His Grace that in spite of his gentility he was doing no better than the worst of them in robbing the people of
Glasgow	LOCATION	of a large sum of money as the price of permission to take water at their own expense from the natural reservoir of
Loch Katrine	PERSON	.

		The contact of Mr.
Fels	PERSON	with British mem - bers of parliament and the poor-law author - ities in his many efforts to provide , through the utilization of waste lands and by means of farm colonies , some kind of employment for the poor that would be free of that stigma of charity which he hated as by an inborn instinct , is full of romantic interest .

		It is indeed reminiscent at many points of the struggle of his great kinsman
Moses	PERSON	with the conservative forces of
Egypt	LOCATION	on behalf of the oppressed Israelites ; and the total response accorded to his efforts might appropriately have been summed up in the words of the writer of Exodus : `` They be idle ; therefore let more work be laid upon them that they may labor therein ; and let them not regard vain words . ''

		His impeachment of the institu - tion of landlordism , onwards from the point at which he became convinced that here he had discovered the pivot on which the entire social problem revolves , recalls the denuncia - tions of the later Hebrew prophets of the iniquity of '' adding field to field so that the people have no room . ''

		The passages which tell of the encourage - ment and assistance given by Mr.
Fels	PERSON	to the cause of woman suffrage are interesting as showing the keenness of instinct by which he detected every line of approach to that condition which must underlie all human progress , the condition of freedom ; and the author 's own defense of the feminist movement , covering three or four pages , is perhaps one of the clearest and most incisive statements of the case for the emancipation of women that has yet been seen .

		The few pages which Mrs.
Fels	PERSON	devotes to dealing with the attitude of Mr.
Fels	PERSON	to the Zionist movement are of deep interest , especially in view of the recent developments of enthusiasm among the Jewish people on the subject of the coloniza - tion of Palestine .

		By a fine artistic fitness the purely domestic part of this impressive career is reserved for a short chapter at the close of the book and is headed `` personal . ''

		Without this the volume would have been incomplete ; yet the author , with a discrimination we much admire , has frankly recognized that the chief interest of the public in its great men lies in their rela - tion to the Zeitgeist , or the larger currents of thought and movements of political opin - ion .

		By the aid of two excellent portraits , the few personal details given in this final chapter recall the living man as he walked among us , with a vividness that is almost magical .

		Those who , like the reviewer , were privileged to know Mr.
Fels	PERSON	with even a small degree of intimacy , will feel towards his biog - rapher a large sense of gratitude for having provided us with a fitting memorial of a lovable friend , but still more so for having given to the wo * ld an interior view of a type of character that may yet redeem
America	LOCATION	from the charge under which she lies of sub - serviency to the god Mammon ; and which indeed , in the largest sense possible , may prove the ultimate salvation of our unhappy civilization .

		Music is fundamentally a medium for the emotions ; but it has its intellectual aspect We can not intelligently contrast the music of

		264 THE DIAL -LSB-
October	DATE	5 definite knowledge of the evolution of musical art and of the lives of those precious few who could listen to the music of the gods and reduce it to vibrations that ordinary mortal ears can register .

		So all that helps to an acquaintance with the lives of musical com - posers , with the periods of musical develop - ment in which they lived , and with the spirit of the times in which they labored , is of the greatest value not merely to the few who seek technical proficiency , but to the many who attempt to be what have happily been called `` creative listeners . ''

		- This is the service which
Romain Holland	PERSON	performed in `` Musicians of Former Days '' and `` Musicians of To-day , '' and which he repeats in his brief but excellent sketch of the life and technique of
George Frederick Handel	PERSON	.

		The book is written in a popular style , for the general reader , and occupies a field quite apart from that of the elaborate works of Chrysander and
Schoelcher	PERSON	.

		Yet
M. Rolland	PERSON	makes his book readable by sound methods .

		He does not deal with the legendary Handel ; he gives no weight to such stories as that of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's learning to play on a clavi - chord smuggled into the garret , or of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's following on foot the carriage in which his father journeyed to Weissenfels -LRB- where the Duke of
Saxony	LOCATION	obtained paternal consent to the boy 's musical education -RRB- , which are recounted even in
Grove	LOCATION	's Dictionary .

		The narrative is straightforward and authenti - cated , and gives an excellent impression of the historicity of the man who was , in a sense ,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's
John the Baptist	LOCATION	.

		The book is particularly valuable for the illuminating background which
M. Rolland	PERSON	furnishes by his description of places and con - temporary persons and events .

		As no great creative artist is a lone figure when you under - stand his environment , it is of the first importance to know how men and things have influenced the development of his art .

		In such matters
M. Rolland	PERSON	shows his under - standing of the office of biographer ; his incisive sketches , for example , of
Keiser	PERSON	,
Mattheson	ORGANIZATION	,
Buxtehude	PERSON	,
Steffani	PERSON	,
Bononcini	LOCATION	, and
Zachau	PERSON	-LRB-
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's teacher -RRB- aid us greatly in understanding the real
Handel	ORGANIZATION	.


M. Rolland	PERSON	regards
Handel	PERSON	as a unique fig - ure in his early musical maturity .

		Musical biographers usually take some pains to trace the transformation from stage to stage of their subject 's development .

		Thus it is possi - ble to divide the Beethoven sonatas or
Wagner	PERSON	music-dramas into classes or periods , with chronological tags .


M. Rolland	PERSON	has no such task .

		Handel had no early style per se to contrast with later styles .

		He reached his zenith of power very quickly and remained there .

		It is only approximately accurate even to speak of his operas as belonging to an ear - lier period than his oratorios , for his first ora - torio was composed before his first opera , while the fact that his operas as a whole are earlier than his oratorios is due to a practical reason , and his greater attention to oratorio in his later years was due to the exigencies of per - sonal politics .

		In addition ,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's oratorios are essentially dramatic in their character .

		This brings us to the second important point which
M. Rolland	PERSON	establishes , namely , that
Handel	PERSON	is falsely rated as a church musician .

		He rarely wrote for the church .

		Aside from his '' Psalms '' and `` Te Deum , '' he wrote music only for concerts -LRB- including open-air performances -RRB- and the theatre .

		His oratorios were written for the theatre , and .

		some of the early ones were really acted .

		He resolutely opposed the production of his ora - torios in the church , even to the extent of arousing the enmity of religious bigots , and insisted to the end that he worked and wrote for a free theatre .

		The contrary impression doubtless has arisen from the fact that his subjects are mainly of Biblical origin .

		But
Handel	PERSON	's oratorios are in their very nature music-dramas ; and , instead of religious inclinations leading him to Biblical sources , he was guided in his choice by the fact that this material had a much more vital appeal to the audience he addressed than had profane mythology .

		Yet so tenacious are traditions that probably for a long time will Handel the preacher be forced in the popular esteem to obscure Handel the artist .


M. Rolland	PERSON	shows the versatility of
Handel	PERSON	and his adaptability to all styles .

		He gives an impressive list of examples to demon - strate
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's use of all styles without choos - ing any one permanently , likening him to
Gluck	PERSON	alone in this respect .

		Handel 's art was universal in its nature .

		His genius was attracted to everything good ; and this explains his general use not only of methods but also of materials .

		It dissolves the so - called plagiarisms .

		He never hesitated to adopt the ideas of others , or to re-work his own ; but always because his genius found therein some beauty that had been over - looked .

		`` Handel has evoked from the very depths of these musical phrases , their secret soul , of which the first creators had not even a presentiment .

		It needed his eye , or his ear , to discover in the serenade of
Stradella	LOCATION	its Biblical cataclysms ... Handel heard great storms passing through the gentle quiv - ering of
Stradella	LOCATION	's guitar . ''


1916	DATE	-RSB- 265 Then there is the romanticism of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's music .

		Perhaps
M. Holland	PERSON	might have emphasized a little more
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's foreshad - owing of the romantic school , though he does call him a `` Beethoven in chains '' and quotes
Beethoven	PERSON	and
Haydn	PERSON	as pronouncing Handel the greatest of all composers .

		It would have been enlightening , however , to have traced more definitely
Handel	PERSON	's influence on his successors .

		Haydn .

		Beethoven ,
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	PERSON	,
Liszt	PERSON	, and ``
Wagner	PERSON	were only a few of those who drew ideals from HandeL His music is picturesque and descriptive .

		It is a `` picture gallery of nature '' in portraying the sea .

		storm , night , moonlight , sunshine , and awakening birds .

		It did not escape criticism for its non-conformity to precedent .

		This was said of him by one of his critics : `` He can not give people pleasure after the proper fashion , and his evil genius will not allow him to do this .

		He imagines a new grandiose kind of music , and in order to make more noise he has it executed by the greatest number of voices and instruments which one has ever .

		heard before in a theatre .

		He thinks thus not only to rival the god of musicians , but even all the other gods , like Idle ,
Neptune	LOCATION	, and
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	: for either I expected that the house would be brought down by his tempest , or that the sea would engulf the whole .

		But more unbearable still was his thunder .

		Never have such terrible rumblings fallen on my head . ''

		After that we can acquit even
Schoenberg	PERSON	and
Scriabin !	ORGANIZATION

		The list of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's compositions , the bibli - ography , and the index are all useful .

		Dr.
Hull	PERSON	's translation is quite satisfying .

		There seem to be no important errors other than the confusion as to the
Mercier	PERSON	portrait , which is attributed to
Thornhill	PERSON	in the table of con -
RUSSELL RAMSEY	PERSON	.

		RUSSIA AXD ITS POSSIBILITIES .

		* The most colossal mistake that one can make is to speak of
Russia	LOCATION	as `` she . ''

		That common form of personification has been responsible for many misjudgments of nations and for many wars .

		That abstract concept , `` the Mother Country , '' is for
Russia	LOCATION	and nearly all other countries a very definite Power represented by tax-collectors , rural police , military men , by a tyranny , in other words , which makes life hard for the great majority of the millions that constitute that country .

		reaucracy ; `` she '' of a Tsar who , though per - sonally brave , honorable , and well-intentioned , is so superstitious that if a visitor happens to speak of God instantly stands at salute with his hand at his cap like a private before a sergeant ; `` she '' of a regime that could sum - mon twelve millions of men for mobilization and fail to arm them even with sticks !

		In two vivid chapters of his book entitled `` Potential
Russia	LOCATION	, '' Mr. Child depicts the fatalistic self-sacrificing spirit of Maxim , the typical Russian muzhik , tall , clean , lighk haired , amused at the flock-like disposition of the troops , as they are packed into uncom - fortable trains , who goes forth to give his all for Mother
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Of course
Maxim	ORGANIZATION	has not the gleam of an idea why he is torn away from his sweetheart and his izba , but he I makes no complaint ; he is only one of the | two millions who were ruthlessly sacrificed in | the Mazurian marshes because the shells which would have rendered the fatal charge unnec - essary `` had been dumped in the snow by the order of some railroad official . ''

		He did not know that the freight cars which had car - ried them had been taken to Archangel and reloaded with the imported goods of a Rus - sian merchant in
Petrograd	LOCATION	.

		He did not know that the railroad official had received 100 roubles a car for his part in the transac - tion .

		He did not know that it was Russians who were killing Russians .

		He thought the enemy was responsible .

		Mr.
Child	PERSON	was sent to
Russia	LOCATION	to study at first hand the effect of the war on that great unknown country .

		Not knowing the language , he had to depend on conversations in French .

		English and German being under a ban .

		and he had the disadvantage of getting much of his information through an interpreter .

		But he has returned to this country with a fairly definite notion of the problems which !


Russia	LOCATION	must face when the war is ended , and -LRB- what is more important -RRB- with definite and extremely sensible views as to the duties and the opportunities which lie before
America	LOCATION	.

		The importance of his book is not so much in the pictures that he paints of actually existing conditions .

		the gradual awakening of the Slav giant , the horrible sufferings of the refugees wandering into the interior of
Russia	LOCATION	without property , without hope , dying like grasshoppers .

		though he can find even in these by-products of war wonderful results in human sympathy , in `` a revival of social consciousness . ''

		the promise of `` a new era of , recognition of a spiritual life . ''

		It is rather ' in the final chapters , where he tells the Amer - ican people that if we should share in the marvellous development that is certain to 266 THE DIAL come we must be represented in
Russia	LOCATION	by a Minister who shall be worthy of the position and by business men who shall equal the Ger - mans in catering to the needs of the people , who shall be high-minded and honorable and who shall not be trying to get all and give nothing .

		Mr. Child thinks that the
Russian Bureau	ORGANIZATION	- cracy , after the war , will have learned a les - son and will come to recognize and fear the popular will , which is bound to be enlight - ened .

		But he is fair even to bureaucracy , and shows quite conclusively that the stories com - monly circulated about `` graft '' are greatly exaggerated .

		It is unpleasant , he says , `` to find foreign commercial representatives charg - ing their expense accounts with the payment of graft which was never paid , or to find for - eign business men reciting stories of Russian graft which have no better foundation than that no one will require proof of them . ''

		He himself travelled about
Russia	LOCATION	extensively , and `` was impressed by the fact that , with the pleasant smile of those who regard the foreigner as a guest , his offers -LSB- of fees -RSB- almost without exception were refused by policemen , gendarmes , customs examiners and soldiers . ''

		Indeed , he puts graft last among the three chief reasons for the difficulty which
Russia	LOCATION	is still having in furnishing weapons and mis - siles for her reserve strength of men ; the others being incompetence and transportation difficulties .

		One chapter , entitled ``
Russia	LOCATION	's Better Half , '' is devoted to the position and influ - ence of women .

		Here Mr. Child records the fact that the Russian Intelligentsia -LRB- which he elsewhere spells `` Intelligenza '' -RCB- `` has in its vague membership a startling proportion of women . ''

		It includes titled ladies of immense wealth , and peasant girls who speak half a dozen languages and at the age of nineteen publish pamphlets .

		He found himself , how - ever , sympathizing with the bureaucratic fear of ultimate industrial revolt : The autocratic government of
Eussia	LOCATION	is at least a government .

		At times it takes terrible , and often stupid , measures to suppress the people .

		A censor - ship , whether in war or peace , which aims to deceive , is a fact before the eyes of the awakening intelli - gence more irritating than those truths which the censorship can conceal .

		The fact that only half - truths go about in rumors leads to exaggerations .

		Secret police activities have stimulated rather than restrained the spirit of revolt .

		But were revolt to come successfully , the people of Eussia could not to-day supply a goverment which would last .

		The intelligent class might set one up ; but it would be too idealistic to be firm , and the unintelligent mass and mob would tear it down .

		It would be a
Mexico	LOCATION	raised to the nTH power ; and it is fortunate that the war and other influences have come to give the people a national spirit and a sense of restraint and , in the end , a more deliberate manner of seeking reform .

		Naturally , therefore , Mr.
Child	PERSON	does not believe that the war will be followed by revo - lution like that abortively started after the Russo-Japanese War .

		A remarkable chapter of Mr.
Child	PERSON	's book is devoted to the abolition of liquor-selling , which he calls `` a Miracle Measure , '' and which he credits to the initiative of the Em - peror even before the outbreak of hostili - ties .

		Mr.
Child	PERSON	went to
Russia	LOCATION	`` an opponent of any national prohibition , '' and expected to come away with support for his views .

		But he confesses that he was routed , and his description of the marvellous success of the repression of the vodka traffic will rejoice the heart of total abstainers .

		He sets down the following to the credit of prohibition : An orderly mobilization .

		A better trained and more efficient army .

		A reduction of crime and immorality .

		A lessening of pauperism .

		A general public opinion in favor of prohibition and its main - tenance .

		An increase of industrial efficiency , which manufacturers and government investigators estimate at not less than
30 per cent	MONEY	.

		A decrease in the economic waste involved in the consumption of alco - hol .

		A more certain resource for government revenue .

		A new era of thrift .

		A new generation of youth free from the alcoholic appetite .

		Better babies .

		After two chapters prophesying the future of
Russia	LOCATION	and outlining its almost infinite riches , still mainly undeveloped , the volume closes with the climax-chapter , `` A Call to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Child	PERSON	has written a valuable book , eminently dispassionate , friendly , critical , and on the whole free from the glaring errors which a series of journalistic snap-shots might naturally have contained .

		There are some misprints .

		In the table of contents the first chapter is designated `` Heat for Cannon . ''

		Mr.
Child	PERSON	invariably calls the Emperor `` the Czar , '' which has no excuse at least in spell - ing .

		On page 158 the word gorodovoi ' mas - querades as gordovoy .

		The style is generally vivid , although sometimes reportorial and even incorrect .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 267 MORE TRANSLATIONS OF RUSSIAN FICTION .

		* When Miss Isabel Hapgood made her first translations of
Gogol	PERSON	and of the Russian epic songs , more than twenty years ago , she found a very small public willing to follow her enthusiasm for Slavic literature .

		Now gen - eral interest in
Russia	LOCATION	is so great that she has been urged to reissue a number of her earlier , almost still-born , volumes , and to supplant her selections from
Gogol	PERSON	's `` Taras Bulba '' by a version of the complete work .

		Few pioneers in a new field can have had a more genuine satisfaction in the reward of their labor than this unusualty competent student ; for in her rendering she gives the sense of being always close to her original , carrying over into Eng - lish the nuances of style and the numerous provincialisms which give individual flavor to this vivid and full-blooded tale of a semi - savage , sixteenth-century
Ukraine	LOCATION	hero .

		The picture in the book is one to be remem - bered by readers of later Slavic fiction , for its retrospect on the warlike and coarsely masculine clan life of the Steppe makes possi - ble an understanding of some contradictory phases in the later culture so faithfully revealed by
Goncharov	PERSON	,
Turgeniev	PERSON	, and their fellows .

		The racial superstition which gives to the
State Church	ORGANIZATION	the terrible power that
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's `` Confession '' shows it to have , the general worship of military status that allows `` A Hero of Our Time '' to prey upon society , the traditional patriarchal despotism of heads of families that partly causes
Anna	PERSON	's tragedy in
Dantchenko	PERSON	's `` With a Diploma , '' all these elements remain in the very fibre of the Russian race .

		Old
Taras Bulba	PERSON	, with his immense love of life , his zeal for activity motived actually only by itself , instead , as he fondly believes , by love of country and the faith , this ancient tribal hero seems indeed at first sight very far in spirit from the sensi - tive , introspective , and profoundly tragic figures of many Russian stories , yet he is not so unlike them as he appears ; for emotional power and a craving for experience charac -

		terize them all alike .

		In his case , however , the outward goal leadership is easily attainable , for he is unhesitating straightfor - wardness itself ; most of the others are so fevered by conflicting impulses that their ability to choose among several courses of action is entirely obscured .

		Gorky 's Matvei , whose `` Confession '' is said to be non-autobiographic , is perhaps the extremest contrast to
Bulba	LOCATION	among the men presented in these recently translated vol - umes .

		His search for God , beginning in his lonely childhood and continued after the death of his dearly loved wife and little son , leads him through scenes of frightful revelation .

		First he discovers the falseness of miracles and the venality of the secular clergy ; next the rottenness of the orthodox monasteries and the futility of ascetic renunciation ; finally he comes to a vision of the awakening People , the humble workers and plodding thinkers , true creators of the God who shall ultimately exist when justice and mercy shall have become more than hollow words among men .

		This modern Pilgrim 's Progress is as replete with hope and as poignantly touching as
Bunyan	PERSON	's other-worldly search , notwith - standing the bitterness of satiric intention underlying
Matvei	ORGANIZATION	's naively simple style .

		It has neither the triteness of motive nor the touch of sentimentality that makes so popu - larly appealing
Korolenko	PERSON	's pleas for social justice , ``
Makar	PERSON	's Dream '' and `` In Bad Company '' ; but it has a far larger canvas and a much wider range of thought than they .

		As art , however , `` The Confession '' is not to be compared to
Dantchenko	PERSON	's two short stories , as modern as it in general point of view , more detached than it in method of tell - ing .

		`` With a Diploma '' is the brief life-history of a woman of ordinary intelligence and of more than ordinarily strong character , the mistress and almost wife of a landed propri - etor .

		When she discovers that her lord despises her for lack of knowledge and for dependence on him , she resolves through hard study to educate herself to independence as a nurse hoping that evidence of her capacity will bind him firmly to her .

		But irony crowns the end .

		Anna returns from her two years ' exile in
Petrograd	LOCATION	hospitals to find the man for whom she has been laboring to perfect herself entirely cold to her , and ready to cast her off completely for another and a younger woman .

		Out of the ruin that confronts her , this com - monplace woman is shown as capable of wrest - ing victory , of a subdued and disillusioned sort , because each situation that came before the climax had been met by her with an honesty and directness impossible for the 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	meanness and cruelty of her master to wreck .

		The man , like
Lermontov	PERSON	's Pechorin an acidly drawn type of the worldly egoism developed in officer 's barracks is almost too utterly contemptible to be convincing ; Pech - orin , like him , seems to exist chiefly in order to accent the characters of the women who love him and of whom he so quickly tires .

		Russian artists are apparently somewhat obsessed by the fascinations of a study of egoism in all varieties of its manifestation , especially as a morbidity akin to madness .


Feodor Sologub	PERSON	prefaces the new translation of `` The Little Demon '' by an explanation that might introduce appropriately not only his own absorbing novel but many of the tales here briefly reviewed .

		After a word of com - pliment to his translator he says : I should like to warn my readers against the temptation of seeing only Russian traits in this novel .

		The portrait of Peredonov -LSB- the hero -RSB- is an expres - sion of the all-human inclination towards evil , of the almost disinterested tendency of a perverse human soul to depart from the common course of universal life .

		.

		and , taking vengeance upon the world for its own grievous loneliness , to bring into the world evil and abomination ... A soul marred by this tragic affliction , that of a morose separation from the world , is borne along by a sovereign justice , which rules worlds and hearts , upon disastrous paths , towards madness and towards death ... In what blessed land is not man tormented with this agoniz - ing sadness , these true tokens of the same morose and sombre affliction ?

		.

		.

		This novel will not be accepted by you in condemnation of my country my country has not a few enchantments which make her beloved , not only by her own , but also by the observant stranger .

		Perhaps the attentive reader will find even in this sombre novel certain reflections of enchanting Eussian nature , and of the live Russian soul .

England	LOCATION	-RRB- said that
England	LOCATION	was notably behind the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	in the matter of fiction at least .

		Many would think
England	LOCATION	to have been equally behindhand , in those days , in poetry and the drama ; yet think what has been done since then !

		How finely English fiction , poetry , drama has recovered from what were called bad days !

		Even if things be badly off with our own literature , there are still possibilities .

		I would not , even in fancy , offer myself for the position of receiver in any such matter as this .

		It would be immensely interesting to take a literary survey , a sort of inventory or account of stock , in the matter of American literature , to see what we really have and to try to form an opinion as to how far American literature fulfils the promises it made years ago .

		I suppose insolvency means that one can not pay one 's obligations , that one can not live up to the hopes one has aroused .

		It would be interesting to look over the ground and see what we had in American literature to produce , when people questioned our sol - vency .

		`` Produce the books . ''

		people say , when there is talk of anything of the sort , what is there that we have done ?

		It would take more information , more judgment , more taste , to be able to tell , and much more room than is at the moment available .

		Still as -LRB- I suppose -RRB- on a hint of a slump , or on a sug - gestion of insolvency , men are likely to look about them to see what they have and what it may be worth , so we may look at the books coming out -LRB- mere novels though they be -RRB- with rather a broader view than usual and try to estimate what they can do to make good the promises that American literature has made .

Smith	PERSON	had to a great degree the gift of presenting attractive and interesting phases of life in such a manner as to arouse in many a glow of admiring interest .

		He felt keenly what people vaguely call `` charm . ''

		The quality , the .

		atmosphere , of an old inn or a good club , of a fine old gentleman or a dear old lady , these were things that appealed to him and that he made appeal to others .

		I used to think that he failed to come very close to life itself , as most of us know it , that he presented what we might call an aristocratic view of life , if we had in mind chiefly the aristocracy of the club or the library or the comfortable bank account .

		I never saw many of his pictures , but those which I recall were like his novels in that they showed a great gift of seeing what was charming , fine , and beautiful , and ren -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 269 dered it so that we thought it was charming , fine , and beautiful .

		Many will think art need go no further , and that we may be lucky if it gets as far as that .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was impressed , for one thing , with the charm of what we may call -LRB- in this day of constant changes -RRB- `` old ''
New York	LOCATION	, and he often ren - dered it in his novels .

		In `` Felix O'Day '' he had in mind a characteristic bit of old
Fourth Avenue	LOCATION	; it is the bit about
Washington Square	LOCATION	and
Waverley Place	LOCATION	that is the locality of ''
Enoch Crane	PERSON	. ''

		a novel of which his plan has been carried out by his son .

		Mr.
F. Berkeley Smith	PERSON	, in trying to catch the tone of his father 's reminiscence , has gone rather farther into the past than was neces - sary .

		The period of ``
Enoch Crane	PERSON	'' is pre - sumably about a generation ago .

		It was somewhere in the days of horsecars ; but I can not think of any definite time when
Harrigan	PERSON	and
Hart	PERSON	were old and when ham - merless guns were new , because , as a matter of fact , the latter chronologically preceded the former .

		But doubtless Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has the eighties in mind .

		In his book , however , he gets much farther back than that : his char - acters and their ways of doing things belong to a period long before the eighties ; they are positively archaic .

		The villain is certainly the contemporary of the fine old vintages which Mr.
Smith	PERSON	so appreciatively mentions ; one waits expectantly to hear Sue say , `` Unhand me , sir ! ''

		He belongs not to the time of
Harrigan	PERSON	and
Hart	PERSON	, but to the first years of Tony Pastor and even the epoch which preceded Pastor .


Enoch Crane	PERSON	himself has an interest per - haps factitious ; he appears to me to be not unlike Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	himself .

		Of course he had his differences , he was a retired lawyer and so on .

		But , like Mr.
Smith	PERSON	,
Enoch Crane	PERSON	was preeminently a gentleman , a man who loved what was fine and noble in life and hated what was low and bad .

		One may be thankful for that , though it takes more than that to be a novelist .


Enoch Crane	PERSON	had views on art and artists , he declared the need of `` men who saw nature freshly and vigorously , with open eyes , and the clear cour - age of their convictions to smash pat on the canvas something that was really real . ''

		That was something that we may imagine American literature ought to do as well as American painting .

		Whether the best way to render the really real is to smash it pat on the canvas I have my doubts , but I have none whatever as to the need of artists looking at life freshly and vigorously .

		That is something that both Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	and Mr.
F. Berkeley Smith	PERSON	understand clearly , and perhaps both looked at life in that way .

		though I think few would get any such idea from `` Enoch Crane '' or its predecessors .

		It is a very easy matter to talk about , this looking at life freshly and vigorously ; but when you come to use it as a touchstone of art or literature , it makes sad havoc .

		Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	for some years has been known as a writer of interesting and popular stories .

		Are they popular and interesting because they give us a fresh and vigorous view of life ?

		Why is it that in `` After the Manner of Men '' Mr.
Lynde	PERSON	writes of a man pursuing a busi - ness enterprise in spite of the most violent and underhand opposition of an unscrupulous trust ?

		Is it because he has '' looked freshly and vigorously at life '' ?

		No , it is because about twenty years ago Mr.
H. K. Webster	PERSON	and Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	looked freshly and vigorously at life and saw men struggling against corporations ; Mr.
Lynde	PERSON	has looked at them or their books or their followers .

		Why does Mr.
Lynde	PERSON	locate his coal-mine in the mountains of
Tennessee	LOCATION	?

		Was it because he had looked at life freshly and vigorously , and found in the mountains of
Tennessee	LOCATION	some - thing that he must render ?

		Miss
Mary N. Murfree	PERSON	looked at life in those mountains a generation ago .

		and since her day they have been one of the conventional scenes .

		Why does Mr.
Lynde	PERSON	have a mine-manager with `` a clean-cut face and a resolute jaw , '' a sweet - faced young millionaire with a cherubic smile , a fine old crusted Southern judge , and so on ?

		Not surely because he has looked freshly and vigorously at life , but -LRB- I suppose -RRB- because in his mind such things taken together make an interesting and attractive story .

		We may ask ourselves the same questions with many another book .

		They are not cer - tain tests partly because one can not always be sure that one applies them rightly , and partly because some people can write very agreeably without much notion of life itself .

		But in a general way it is some direct impres - sion of life that we want .

		Take Mr. F. 0 .


Bartlett	PERSON	's `` The Wall Street Girl . ''

		This attractive tale at once raises the question , Can such things be ?

		Grant that they can be , and you get along very nicely .

		That is in accord with some of the old characteristics of Ameri - can literature .

		What lots of stories there used to be with a much more impossible assump - tion at bottom treated as though they were the merest matters of fact , a whole row of them from `` The Diamond Lens '' on , and even before that .

		So in Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	's story we need not quarrel with the man 's being dead broke because of the father 's strange will , 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	and the nice stenographer lending him two dollars to get egg sandwiches with .

		Still , as one goes on it does not seem the closest realism .

		Realism has for some time been one of the great cards of American literature .

		Back in the seventies , some will remember , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	were making great beginnings as realists ; that is , they seemed so in the public mind , though nowadays it is hard to see how any one could have thought of them as doing anything to be described by the same word .

		Perhaps they really did both put aside literary traditions , fancy under the name of romance , idyllic sentiment , and go in for the real thing .

		Plenty of Americans have done so since that day , though perhaps we have done nothing much better than many other people .

		But I do not believe we can put Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	's novel under the head of realism , any way , of the old-time kind .

		It is impossible for me to say that the life of clerk and stenographer in a Wall Street office is different from the picture that he draws , for such life is something that I only know about from such periodicals as `` The Ladies Home Journal , '' and so on .

		But it bears the stamp in my mind of fancy and sentiment and tradition .

		It is a charming idyll of Wall Street and old
New England	LOCATION	; but it does not give that so desirable thrill which , comes somehow when we get the real thing .

		Certainly there is much that would seem as an asset in `` Somewhere in Red Gap . ''

		I am not `` up '' -LRB- as used to be said -RRB- in the work of Mr.
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	; even
Ruggles	PERSON	of the same Red Gap is unknown to me except by report , which , of course , is very favorable .

		But such ignorance may be a help to an unprej - udiced judgment .

		Here is a book which in some respects is just what might be expected in American literature , at least just what the English might expect .

		It is humorous , for one thing ; and humor , though rather hard to appreciate in the passage of time , is a characteristic American quality .

		If we could hold our own in humor we should be all right in one great element .

		Americans themselves have not always appreciated their own humor , and even foreigners sometimes have not .

		The humor of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	was often best enjoyed by himself .

		It seems , indeed , as though Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	were a little esoteric , as if he belonged to an inner circle with thought and language relating especially to it ; it seems as if you had to have been submitted to a sort of initiation into American life , to have been a good deal tumbled round by it in fact , to appreciate him .

		But when you have such initiation you will find the stories of Red Gap not only very humorous , but , like all good humor , something beside .

		The main conceptions are rather conventional , but that is only a means .

		Take `` The Red Splash of Romance , '' there is much in the story : if people would read it and take it to heart where they need to , our great American audience would be vastly improved in aesthetic taste and perhaps moral character .

		There was the fat Hobo Poet on a coast-to-coast walking tour , who went to peoples ' offices and handed out a card with a poem on it , a poem com - parable with the best of
Euphemia Hemans Simpson	PERSON	or
Mary C. Burke	PERSON	.

		The account of his subsequent recital at the
Country Club	ORGANIZATION	and his leaving town is rather a conventional extravagance ; but in spite of that the story is an excellent satire , and full of delightful things .

		Many will think it a bit crude , but it has a tonic quality .

		It has all the unex - pected hyperbole , the generalizations in whim - sical national traits , the observation of absurd - ities grown common by daily habit , the ingenious use of literary journalistic chest - nuts , that come so naturally -LRB- it would seem -RRB- to the American humorist .

		`` Somewhere in Red Gap '' is at least American ; no other nation could have produced it .

		I should think `` Somewhere in Red Gap '' ought to be counted as an asset , and I feel quite sure Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's new book , `` The Painted Scene '' is an asset .

		One of the nice things about this last is that it does so much to explain itself , as far as such things ever can be explained .

		One of the people in it is a young dramatist who had just made a strik - ing success .

		An expert explained to him that his work had followed some of the profound - est maxims of the theatre , but he himself felt differently .

		His own explanation was that `` he 'd had the luck to get hold of a good story , that it concerned itself with the sort of people he understood , and that he 'd managed to present it and them with a kind of fresh - ness and honesty that proved attractive . ''

		That is not so different from
Enoch Crane	PERSON	's thoughts on art .

		Whether so or not , it is not very different from what Mr.
Webster	PERSON	has done .

		Here is something that rings the bell -LRB- to use a favorite figure of the author -RRB- , which shows us in a minute that it is worth while .

		Perhaps another might account for it by the profoundest maxims of the short-story ; I am better satisfied with Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's way of putting it .

		`` The Painted Scene '' is a set of sketches of the world of the theatre , or rather of that particular part of the theatre known as musical comedy , which has had its place before in Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's work .

		It is not a
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 271 novel , and does not pretend to be .

		But though it has not the definite structure of action and character that so often seems the necessary thing to make the right impression , it has something else that does quite as well .

		It is full of amusing details , colloquialisms and slang , simple mention of generalities of life not always noticed , light allusions to the stock white checks of theatrical thought , easy tech - nicalities , and so on .

		But these things alone would not carry a collection of stories .

		There is something else , something different from these things , which in one form or another are not unusual .

		That proverbial `` difference , '' Mr.
Webster	PERSON	of course knows all about it .

		Take the pair who met at the stage door , went to one of the regular restaurants and ordered one of the regular suppers , including a quart of the regular champagne , the only thing that made them amusing , worth telling about , something with a punch , was the fact that after those ordinary beginnings came a difference .

		We may look at Mr.
Webster	PERSON	just as he looked at them .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	seems to know pretty well what he is about , and that I suppose is art .

		As his own musical director said , his work `` is good .

		Very nice .

		It has charm and some originality . ''

		But it has also the one other thing needful , the `` something to whistle . ''

		This .

		I presume , means that it has something that fixes itself in your mind with a recurrent obsession which if it lasts long enough , SBSthe - ticians say , is one of the few unvarying notes of beauty , in art or anywhere else .

		But I doubt if it is good to go farther with my abstract generalizations of what is so easy to get in a particular and concrete form .

		I , at least , like it better as Mr.
Webster	PERSON	puts it .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS Two types of ike present - day soldier .

		The `` hero '' of Mr.
Edward Morlae	PERSON	's `` A Soldier of the Legion '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is very unlike the famous person who lay dying in
Algiers	LOCATION	.

		Whatever may be the historical merits of the little narrative or the personal merits of its author , opinions differ on both points , the book certainly steers clear of the moralistic comment now so wearisome to every reader of war `` impressions . ''

		The nar - rative records the deed of a sergeant and one company of the
Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	, who fought in the great Champagne offensive .

		As an elegy of the 2me Stranger now disbanded , it is harsh and crude enough as perhaps it ought to be ; it is apparently untouched with pity ; there may even be a pose in its seem - ingly consistent heartlessness .

		But surely many men see and feel in battle as this man saw and felt .

		Horrors become so common as to be unworthy even of bored remark ; men live literally in and for the passing seconds , with no thought of before and after .

		`` Je m ` excite ! ''

		exclaims an angry legionary because he can not recover a bit of chocolate from the knapsack of a dead comrade .

		The soldiers of the
Legion	ORGANIZATION	, or of Sergeant Morlae 's company , were no `` bloomin ' ` eroes '' ; but , at the very least , most of them died in a not ignoble manner .

		It is a peculiar relief to read Mr.
Morlae	PERSON	's book after Mr.
C. Lewis Hind	PERSON	's `` A Soldier Boy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The people of these `` sketches and cameos '' seem to live on a diet of
Watts	LOCATION	's pictures ,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's music , and the worst of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		A thin coat of conventional devotionalism whitewashes the whole surface of the book .

		It is hard to believe that `` soldier boys '' tolerate such humid sentimentality .

		Beer and skittles and soldiers of the legion are more probable stuff .

		A Russian biography of Dostoievsky .


M. Soloviev	PERSON	's study of `` Dostoi - evsky : His Life and Literary Activity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is ad - dressed so distinctly to a Russian public thor - oughly familiar with
Dostoievsky	ORGANIZATION	's writings that one wonders what motives have led to its translation .

		The book is a sort of review of previous biographies , and presupposes a considerable knowledge of the subject .

		The uninitiated reader gets little but a few scat - tering glimpses instead of a clear idea of the personality of the man , and misses a general discussion of his novels and literary crafts - manship .

		Dostoievsky 's works are notoriously subjective , yet there is little attempt to point the relation between them and his varied experience .

		The most interesting chapters in the book perhaps the only ones to which the general reader will care to turn a second time are the introduction and the conclu - sion .

		The first , while containing nothing new , draws a clear distinction between the genius of Dostoievsky and that of his great contem - poraries ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	; it explains the difficulties , mental and material , under which the former had to work , and sketches his philosophy of life .

		The last chapter , draw - ing largely on the `` Diary of a Writer , '' is an exposition of
Dostoievsky	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward social questions in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Always an ardent sympathizer with the third estate , his dom - inant idea is insistence on what may be learned from the people and what must be done for the people .

		272 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 5	DATE	TWO new books A recent book dismisses
Dante	ORGANIZATION	about `` a waning and others as `` waning classics . ''

		Florentine and Miltonie theolo - gies are outworn , no doubt ; and it stands to the further and vast discredit of the theolo - gians that they have nothing specific to say about such pulsating `` modern '' interests as movies , submarines , suffrage , and the
Gary School System	ORGANIZATION	.

		In spite of these damning facts , Professor
Alfred Brooks	PERSON	, in his volume on `` Dante : How to Know Him '' -LRB- Bobbs -
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has the hardihood to say that `` The Divine Comedy '' `` deals with those questions only , which are of perennial concern to man , in every generation . ''

		And one of the favorite themes exploited in Professor
J. F. Fletcher	PERSON	's little study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Home University Library '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is `` The Modernness of Dante . ''

		These two books are both '' popular , '' in purpose , both are written for cheap series of wide circulation .

		Of course both profes - sors are exponents of an aristocratic and effete culture , and they are therefore highly prejudiced and dangerous judges .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's work follows the general design of the series to which it belongs .

		There is a brief and very elementary introduction , fol - lowed by extracts from `` The Divine Comedy , '' illuminated by notes and a running commen - tary .

		The introduction and comment read simply and smoothly ; and the prose of the translations , while not distinguished , is quite tolerable .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's exposition of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's corpus of work is more extended and authoritative .

		The three main chapters deal with
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Personal Confessions , his Teach - ing , and his Art .

		The wonderful architec - tonics of `` The Divine Comedy '' are exhibited in considerable detail , and yet with entire simplicity and conciseness .

		Perhaps the best thing about Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's book is the clear - ness with which the author explains the rigorous unity of purpose that welds into one body all of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		The visions do more than `` charm mankind exclusively as poetry . ''

		`` A social justice bent on giving each individual .

		.

		his fullest scope .

		.

		; an individual and collective service wholly dedicated and efficiently controlled to the real - ization of human perfection .

		.

		; liberty , equality , fraternity , interpreted essentially in the spirit of the twentieth century , '' such is said to be
Dante	PERSON	's `` message . ''

		A great and sweeping claim indeed !

		And Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	goes far toward its justification .

		Perhaps it is ungracious to pick a flaw in such a book , but one wishes the author had used transla - tions of his own instead of those by Mr.
Henry Johnson	PERSON	, which are new and doubtless faithful but are not poetry .

		Crime and the economic environment .

		A somewhat laborious study of '' Criminality and Economic Conditions , '' translated from the Dutch of
William Adrian Bonger	PERSON	by Mr.
Henry P. Horton	PERSON	, is a late addition to the noteworthy `` Modern Criminal Science Series '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The first part is historical in character and deals with the treatment given the subject by more than fifty writers , from
Thomas More	PERSON	down to men of to-day .

		The general conclusion of this survey is that these writers , with few exceptions , had but little comprehension of the very important bearing of economic con - ditions on crime .

		The author 's point of view toward his subject is based on the Marxian philosophy that the forms of production con - dition the life and ideals of the people .

		So strong is his faith in the economic interpreta - tion of social life that he devotes one chapter to a discussion of the present economic sys - tem , and another to the different social classes .

		These latter , he concludes , owe their origin not to innate differences in capacity but to the existing system of production .

		Likewise , the different forms of marriage are similarly determined .

		The family has a peculiarly definite economic basis .

		Prostitution , whether the result of environment , ignorance , poverty , or other causes , is the consequence of exist - ing social conditions which relate back to the economic system ; although in a few cases degeneracy or defectiveness may be charged with the blame .

		Elaborate statistics are pro- duced to demonstrate the argument relating to prostitution .

		Alcoholism is largely the result of poverty , and has oppressed civiliza - tion because of the increasing development of capitalism ; individual or pathological causes are negligible factors .

		In Book II. , entitled '' Criminality , '' the author contends that prim - itive man was no more egoistic than his mod - ern descendant , and that the economic system which has produced the proletariat must be charged with the mass of crimes that are being committed in the present era .

		A vast array of statistics is presented showing the relation of crime to illiteracy , poverty , occupation , and conjugal condition .

		Crimes against poverty and against persons are discussed , and the low average of criminality among women is explained .

		Crimes of vengeance form the largest group , followed by economic , sexual , and political crimes .

		An examination of these various forms of crime reveals the conclusion that even here the prevailing economic condi - tions are the chief determining factors .

		No one can read this book without feeling the manifest bias of the author .

		It is indeed a powerful presentation of a plausible theory ,
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 273 and the facts are skilfully marshalled to prove the author 's contentions .

		But the reader feels that he is listening to the advocate rather than to the judge .

		The causes of crime seem to be too readily reduced to one underlying cause thoroughly to convince the open-minded reader .

		Nevertheless , the book should impel men and women to consider at once a practi - cable programme for improving the economic environment .

/ M. Andre Maurel	PERSON	's `` A Month i *
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is what might be called a sentimental guide-book sentimental in the good sense .

		Facts it contains in abundance , but no one should look to it as a substitute for the practi - cal guide-book .

		The sentence
M. Maurel	PERSON	applies to himself on his visit to
Hadrian	PERSON	's Villa , `` a simple pilgrim , interested only in impressions , I have no other thought than .

		.

		to note down the passing reflections that they -LSB- the places -RSB- arouse , '' describes his atti - tude toward his subject .

		The book is a com - ment on facts rather than a statement of facts , and assumes on the part of the reader an already considerable familiarity with them .

		This accounts for its strength , which is to help the visitor among
Rome	LOCATION	's wealth of mon - uments to a spiritual interpretation of them , and also for its weakness , which is the fitful - ness of its appeal to the reader of ordinary equipment .

		It will be used with greatest profit by the actual visitor in
Rome	LOCATION	, and next by the returned visitor .

		Its make-up is unique .

		It is divided into thirty `` Days , '' representing as many rambles and excursions in and about the city .

		Each `` Day '' has at its head a map of the section to be visited , is given a suggestive title , such as '' The Paternal Mansion the Forum , '' or ``
Ruskin	PERSON	's Mis - take
Minerva	LOCATION	, Cosmedin , '' and is accompa - nied by good illustrations .

		The spirit of the book is what might be expected in a work written by the author of `` Little Cities of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''


M. Maurel	PERSON	is genial and suave , never quarrelsome nor iconoclastic ; he is well informed , yet not pedantic . ''

		A Month in
Rome	LOCATION	1 '' is the familiar yet polished discourse of one possessed of receptive mind and heart who has read and meditated upon Roman and Italian history , art , and literature in the places of their creation , and enjoys communi - cating his impressions .

		It is greatly to be regretted that many such inaccuracies as `` Cataline , '' `` Thebian . ''

		``
Santa Agnesa	LOCATION	, '' and '' marcellum , '' mar the text .

		Whether they are to be charged to the author , or -LRB- what is more likely -RRB- to the translator , the effect is to lessen the reader 's confidence and respect .

		Any authoritative book that s ^ fc
Africa	LOCATION	.

		throws light on the romantic career of
Louis Botha	PERSON	is welcome in these days , so that Mr.
Harold Spender	PERSON	's `` General Botha : The Career and the Man '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is certain of a reading .

		Nor will Mr.
Spender	PERSON	's readers be disappointed if they look for no more than an account of
Botha	PERSON	's chief activities , from his boyhood to the con - clusion of the conquest of German South -
West Africa	LOCATION	.

		The book is a well written and entertaining account of the succession of apparent miracles achieved by
Botha	PERSON	, but we are given no clue to the methods by which the miracles were achieved .

		Although Mr.
Spender	PERSON	devotes his last chapter to
Botha	PERSON	the man , he succeeds in doing little more than whetting our appetite .

		We are given an account of
Botha	PERSON	's daily activities , together with some impression of his outward char - acteristics ; but the man 's thoughts his doubts , temptations , moods remain undis - closed .

		Here and there , however , we get glimpses that prove more enlightening than chapters of description .

		The bald fact that , rather than disturb old memories ,
Botha	PERSON	has never revisited the farm , `` Waterval . ''

		which had been home to him until the British burned it , comes as a momentary flood of light .

		In the course of the war we see him acting as a decoy , to draw pursuing British regiments away from the last remaining mem - bers of the
Transvaal Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		We see him make a miraculous escape by night through a gap in the surrounding circle of his enemies , sitting upright that he may pro- tect the body of his son from rifle fire .

		And .

		perhaps best of all , when his one-time friend and now bitter political opponent
Hertzog	ORGANIZATION	seeks to improve relations between Dutch and British by talk about the possible treachery of British rule , we hear his retort : `` He reminds me of a man on his honeymoon tell - ing people what he would do if his wife became unfaithful to him . ''

		Doubtless the fact , referred to more than once , that
Botha	PERSON	looks back on the Boer War with feelings only of sadness , and that he steadfastly refuses to be drawn into talk about it .

		even rebuking mention of it at his own table by his children , is an obstacle not easy for the would-be biog - rapher to overcome .

		Yet without attempting a formal biography , Mr.
Spender	PERSON	has estab - lished
Louis Botha	PERSON	's position as one of the great men in modern history and one of the noblest ; and he has stirred desire to the point of insistence on a true biography to follow .

		His book will be read and enjoyed , but with the sort of gratitude that is a keen sense of more and better things to come .

Gaskell	PERSON	's absorbing biography of her friend , there is always room for such sympathetic studies of this enigmatic person as Miss
Maud Goldring	PERSON	's `` Charlotte Bronte the `` Woman '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is the hopeless love of a human heart that the writer offers to our view in the three chapters of her little book .

		`` Preparation , '' `` The Coming of Love , '' `` Loneliness and Fame '' are the headings to these chapters ; and of course it is the much - discussed attachment of
Charlotte	LOCATION	to her
Brussels	LOCATION	schoolmaster that forms the writer 's main theme .

		`` I can not , '' says Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, `` under - stand the people who take literature seriously ; but I can love them , and I do . ''

		This is not , it seems to me , simply another confession of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's innocent passion for all things obsolete .

		It is a confession also of his deep , instinctive militancy .

		He delights in smashing heads always , of course , in a spirit of hilarious Christian charity .

		To the gratification of such a taste , serious people are necessary , for on the frivolous no quarrel can be fastened .

		Whatever he may say , how - ever , I can not feel that the people who take literature seriously have really earned Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's love : they have not supplied him with a single good row .

		His peculiar romanticism has been as provocative as fore - thought and afterthought could make it .

		It has been carefully wild and regularly eccen - tric .

		In vain !

		Nobody has minded .

		As romantic in a world of realists , he can tempt no one to hurl a stone at him .

		Luckily for him , people who take other things seriously are less complacent , and he has been able , by making political , religious , and social orthodoxy terrifying to the orthodox , to stir up as much trouble as he liked .

		If schools no longer divide us , neither do smaller technical squabbles generally .

		Surely there never was a time when the breaking of rules was less exciting for the innovators .

		We have , indeed , an immense zest for freshness ; we seem actually , for the moment , to have put the pleasure of surprise on a level with the pleasure of recognition .

		In strangeness we find a delightful challenge .

		I know that an occasional protest is heard .

		There are critics , for example , who deny that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	writes plays , but such judgments rouse no animosity .

		They neither pack nor empty the playhouse ; they inspire no manifestoes .

		And if those who utter them fancy they have wounded Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, they have failed to grasp the signifi - cance of the fact that his irreverent treatment of Shakespeare as moralist and thinker was not in the least mitigated by his respect for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as dramatic artist .

		In other words , they have failed to take the hint that 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	a dramatist as such need not rank too high in his scale of values , and it is not surprising if even his intemperate enthusiasm for Brieux has left them without a clue .

		Critics , again , will occasionally complain that Mr. `` Wells has mixed his modes , has been so careless or so perverse as to spoil a promising treatise by casting it in fictional form , and such com - plaints are often sufficiently just .

		Only , I hardly think they help us to understand Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		I imagine that one of the things he finds most exasperating at times is the silly popular bias in favor of fiction .

		If he has yielded to it , if he has continued to write novels year after year , is it not largely because he has been unwilling to restrict himself to an audience of specialists , indurated theorists whom no theory can be expected to prick into action ?

		He wanted to vitalize unsophisticated minds .

		All his passion has been so expended ; he has none left over to discuss whether he really is a novelist .

		Besides , it is clear enough that he does not regard the novel as sacrosanct .

		It is only a means to the more ample and passionate apprehension of reality ; it may be copious and loose , as with the Russians , or neatly articulated , as with
Flaubert	PERSON	, and be a novel none the less .

		If the writers themselves have been rel - atively indifferent to the metaphysics of lit - erary forms , the public has been even more so .

		Indeed , this is the wholesome instinct of the public in every age , an instinct invaluable to the initiator .

		The public has asked , as always , simply to be amused , to be stimulated , to be diverted , to be shocked , to be touched or consoled , without stopping to inquire how these admirable and mysterious effects are to be achieved .

		It has sensibly left all that to the craftsmen .

		Discussions of theory may have fluttered the coterie , but even there they have been far from violent .

		It is not , we may be sure , that fanatics are no longer born in our luminous time ; fanatics enliven every period , and the coterie has for them a fatal fascination .

		It is rather that the literary allegiances of yesterday excited attachments to realism , romanticism , what not ?

		have ceased everywhere to be passions and have become simple preferences .

		Even a fanatic will not walk to the stake for a pref - erence , simply to vindicate his inborn fanat - icism .

		As for the average man , supposing him to have any interest in the matter at all , a large and free , if not always quite intelli - gent , skepticism has sufficed .

		It is a way of avoiding passionate error , and perhaps he has acted unknowingly on the hint of Renan , who was able to found a whole philosophy on the fear of dupery .

		`` Ah !

		je fais bien mes com - pliments a ceux qui sont surs de ces choses - la !

		Le mieux est de ne rien affirmer , ou bien de changer d ` avis de temps en temps .

		Comme ga , on a des chances d ` avoir ete au moins une fois dans le vrai . ''

		In all this growing mildness and reason - ableness , it is easy to trace the gradual pene - tration of the literary consciousness by an idea that had already cast its reconciling light over the squabbles of philosophers and scientists .

		I mean , of course , the idea of the relativity of things , of the provisional nature of our truth .

		That idea has long been so familiar that we find it difficult to realize what hecatombs of victims were sacrificed in the past to the Absolute absolute truth , absolute beauty .

		I suppose few critics would be inclined nowadays to dispute
Pater	PERSON	's dic - tum that the definition of beauty becomes unmeaning and useless in proportion to its abstractness , and that to find for it no univer - sal formula , but the formula which expresses most adequately this or that special manifesta - tion of it , is the true business of students of aesthetics .

		Obviously this is a task which can never be finished , as long as we write at all .

		And it is a task which may well fascinate us by reason of the play it gives ' to all that is supple , ingenious , and sympathetic in our minds .

		But the critic has another reward : he is able to repay , in a measure , the debt he is under to such as have given him pleas - ure , and to repay it in the most satisfying way , by communicating his pleasure to others .

		He will be on his guard against any premature stiffening of the sensibilities , which would restrict his pleasure .

		Convinced that beauty , like everything else , is relative , he will speak mild words .

		He will be little likely to repeat the gesture of Canute .

		He will , with what - ever reluctance , grant to realists , romantics , symbolists , impressionists , yes , he will grant also to imagists and futurists , the right to live .

		Such catholicity is irresistibly seductive to the critic , whose business is appreciation and who has no higher hope than to make visible beauty that was formerly hidden .

		Fortunate are the Olympians a Pater , an
Anatole France	LOCATION	who are privileged to rebuke by
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 295 silence alone , and who , in the very act of selection , register a judgment .

		The journey - man critic can never hope to be so fastidious ; the presses set him his task .

		He will have to bear more than they the distrust which attaches , in some measure , to all who dis - criminate their enthusiasms .

		He works in haste ; he wants detachment , If he has been bored and happens to have wit , he will not always restrain the impulse to be pungent .

		Well , these are human limitations , and even pungency is not despicable .

		I think we would not spare the touch of malice that has sharp - ened more than one critic 's vision in the past , and it would be sheer hypocrisy to pretend that we have become too tender to relish the joys of gladiatorship .

		We are not ready to ask the critic to refrain from judging on the ground that he may be throttling an infant truth .

		As long as the progeny of error is at least equal to the progeny of truth , a little throttling will be in order .

		Besides , the critic 's modesty mercifully delivers him from a pom - pous and cautious responsibility .

		To Assume it would be to show that he cherished illusions as to his own importance , and that he had forgotten how little harm the follies of criti - cism have done in the past .

		Where so much mildness is the modern rule , however , there is one quarrel that has not been composed .

		This is really a human , rather than a literary quarrel : the quarrel between parents and children , the old up - holding the authority of departed gods , the young striving to enlarge the Pantheon .

		Although we now understand this quarrel in all its pathetic implications , we do not , luckily , remain indifferent to its successive manifestations .

		How stirring most of us found the assault on the Victorians at the turn of the century !

		Only now is the bitter - ness losing its force .

		The lately dead are rivals of the living .

		Yes , and they are more than rivals .

		They are , often enough , dis - carded props and models as well .

		A vigorous ego will revenge itself for such servitude as immoderate admiration implies .

		It is too wounding to self-esteem .

		Witness the venom with which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	vindicated his maturity against discipleship to
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		And those whom Zola had warmed in his bosom , buried their fangs in his flesh .

		Zola has been terribly reviled .

		I think we ought to remem - ber the nobility of his acquiescence : `` After all , it is the eternal law children devour their fathers .

		I make no complaint .

		Nature has willed it so . ''

		Apart from the antagonistic interests that divide youth from age , apart from the dif - ference of animal heat and consequently of emotional values , apart from the difference of experience and vision , there is another reason for their eternal quarrel : I mean the difference in their curiosity .

		There is no use in pretending that our curiosity lasts for - ever .

		No , it wears out like youth , like beauty , like ardor , like everything else .

		Our curiosity , which is always scourging us as with a lash to renewed effort , is opposed even from the first by our natural human indolence ; and there comes a time , whether early or late , when indolence triumphs .

		Why not ?

		What could be more exhausting than a prolonged exercise of the critical faculty , always alert , always challenging , and yet flexible enough to submit itself to one enthusiasm after another ?

		To be asked to make up one 's mind afresh about the merits of every youngster that comes up out of the unknown , becomes at last intolerable to most of us .

		Small wonder , then , if occasionally an aging pon - tiff , anxious to keep for a little his hard-won certitudes , invokes the terror of the law and consigns the newest aspirant to perdition .

		What !

		are there not gods enough already !

		It is a cry that can stir our sympathy in moments of weariness and disenchantment , but to accept it involves a denial of life

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, . -RRB-

		There seems to be no diminution in the output of war books in all the European capitals .

		For instance , the well-known
Paris	LOCATION	publisher ,
Delagrave	LOCATION	, said to me recently : `` In our list of new publications to appear during the hostilities , you will find that most of them bear on the events of the moment , which is in fact the dominant feature of about all that issues from the French press at this time '' ; and in the catalogue which he gave me , I noted that twenty-two out of the twenty-eight volumes mentioned have to do with the present conflict or with subjects connected therewith .

		In
England	LOCATION	the native supply does not satisfy the craving for war literature ; so the
London	LOCATION	publishers turn to
Paris	LOCATION	for a fresh
2 %	PERCENT	THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	supply .

		One of the more recent and best of these translations is that of the book of Lieutenant
Paul Hyacinthe Loyson	PERSON	, men - tioned in my
April	DATE	contribution to
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, which in its English dress will appear under the title , `` Our Fight for Right , '' or `` The Gods in the Battle , '' the author and pub - lisher not being agreed on this point in the last letter which I received from
London	LOCATION	.

		But they were of one mind as regards the sub-title , `` A French Democrat 's Answer to ` Above the Battle ' of
Romain Rolland	PERSON	. ''

		The translator will be Lady
Frazer	PERSON	, wife of the author of `` The Golden Bough , '' and the preface will be by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, `` the great novelist and pro-allied socialist , '' as Lieu - tenant
Loyson	PERSON	describes him to me .

		In the English edition , the text will be reduced by a third .

		One of the best of the French war books has not , I think , reached
America	LOCATION	; though I believe it has appeared in
London	LOCATION	.

		I refer to the `` Journal d'un Simple Soldat '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by
Gaston Riou	PERSON	, a young man remarkable in many respects .

		The volume is dedicated to
Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	, and the preface is by Senator
Edouard Herriot	PERSON	, Mayor of
Lyons	PERSON	.

		The author travelled in
Germany	LOCATION	before the present war , and you see and feel on almost every page that he knew well and liked the older and better Fatherland .

		It was his duty at the front to pick up the wounded ; and while engaged in this dangerous work , he himself was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans .

		From a long unpublished letter by
M. Riou	PERSON	, I select the following passages , chiefly because they so well illustrate the splendid moral and gay spirit of the French soldier of to-day : I wrote this book when I was starving in prison .

		I wished to leave to my intended something of myself .

		The reader will perceive that the tone which pervades it is intimate .

		I say little about ideas , which is the reason , perhaps , why it has succeeded .

		In a word , this book is truly a `` sacred union '' one ; it is myself , my dream , my reason for living .

		Well , I did not have to bore my fiancee too much with it , for as soon as the packages began to come from
France	LOCATION	, my com - panions in captivity chose me as their president and I was kept so busy distributing the food that I found time to write only two more chapters .

		I have now married her whom I often refer to in my book , and , though my wounds have healed , my leg , which con - tinues to be weak , allows me to take only short walks with her .

		This wife has a fine voice and she would sing you the songs that I like ; and because she is proud of her poilu , she would read you the high - sounding mention , which I have just received , in dispatches .

		My dream has been a
France	LOCATION	, the apostle and champion of intellectual liberty and fraternity .

		There was nothing chauvinistic in this .

		I do not like the French who wish for a
Prussianized France	ORGANIZATION	.

		I am a son of
' 89	DATE	, and not one of those who say , This idea is true because it is French , but rather , This idea will become French because it is true .

		Montaigne ,
Eabelais	LOCATION	,
Calvin	PERSON	,
Pascal	PERSON	,
Descartes	LOCATION	, La Bruyere ,
Jean Jacques	PERSON	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Michelet	PERSON	,
Lamennais	LOCATION	, all are inno - vators ; and if they lived to-day , they would defend
France	LOCATION	not only as one defends his land , his factory , but as something ideal , sacred , human , and by so doing would defend in her one of the best champions of the ideal of humanity .

		Viewed in this light , they are true Christians , for in the free spirit of these great Frenchmen there is more true Christianity than in the political clericalism of our most sincere present - day French catholics .

		The illustrator of the book was a fellow captive of the author ; and this is how
M. Riou	PERSON	, a Protestant , presents his collaborator , a Jew , thus offering us another charming description of the French soldier and a further example of the `` sacred union '' which now prevails in
France	LOCATION	:
Jean Heles	PERSON	, an interesting artist , is the pseudonym of
Jean Le Seyeux	PERSON	, who , a boy , was doing his mili - tary service when the war broke out .

		His father is a well-to-do dealer in antiques and his mother is of Jewish origin .

		He is the nephew of the actors Worms and
Barretta	LOCATION	.

		Full of animal spirits , always in good humor , the gayest of our band , he was so starved with the rest of us that he could not rise from his bed of straw .

		But yet he killed the heavy hours by making cubist caricatures , while I managed to smuggle in the food necessary to keep his body and soul together until the home packages began to arrive .

		And all the time he kept on drawing and drawing .

		Some of the work made under these semi - tragic conditions is found in the pages of my book .

		Little by little I learned Jean 's history , how he made the designs for a large fashionable dress-maker of
Paris	LOCATION	, how he was the author of a successful `` revue , '' etc. .

		He is , too , a born decorator , and I am sure he will make his mark .

		In strong contrast with this light-hearted study of the war is the more scientific `` Enseignements Psych ologiques de la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Flammarion , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by the learned Dr.
Gustave Le Bon	PERSON	.

		This book shows us that the present struggle absorbs not only the energy of men of action like
Gaston Riou	PERSON	, but also occupies the attention of philosophers .

		Dr. Le Bon finds in this conflict a grandiose illustration , a striking confirmation , of the psychologic principle which he has already striven in other works to establish .

		He had applied these principles to the study of diverse historical crises , espe - cially to the French Revolution ; and now by applying them to the conflagration raging at this moment , the author throws much welcome light on certain of its obscure sides , while at the same time he does not let his patriotism run too much away with his judgment .

		In this connection he has written me : I have been very much absorbed of late with my new book , `` Les Premieres Consequences de la Guerre , '' where is to be found more than one consequence inter - esting to Americans .

		Naturally the chief one is that the assimilation of your Germans , which you thought complete , has not at all been accomplished , and what is more , could not be accomplished .

		Your Germans
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 297 are the enemy within .

		We have them from without .

		But the danger from the first is not less than that from the second .

		The state of public mind which produces these high-spirited books is echoed in any afternoon 's conversation in the literary circles of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Let me give some examples of this .

		An academician said to me apropos of the German excesses in poor
Belgium	LOCATION	: ``
Talley	LOCATION	- rand summed the whole thing up when he remarked : ` It is easy to militarize a civilian but impossible to civilize a soldier . ' ''

		A leading critic added : `` A great people is not the one that concocts the most asphyxiating gases but the one that does most to advance civilization . ''

		And here is the language of the venerable
Rene Fouret	PERSON	, head of the great publishing house of
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, who had retired from business long before the war broke out , but who immediately went into harness again : We have entered upon the third year of the struggle , and I think that our friends the English and Russians and we may consider with a certain pride the route we have traversed together .

		What an enormous effort we have had to make to be able to stand up success - fully against the attacks of the most powerful enemy that has ever existed .

		I find myself ever , asking myself the question by what miracle we have been able to escape that iron grip .

		The sympathy we have awakened among the true friends of
France	LOCATION	is very precious to us and sustains us in this hard trial .

		And another elder ,
Camille Flammarion	PERSON	, the popularizer of astronomy , has attained the calmness of soul which permits him to be engaged at the present moment `` in classing my papers for a future volume of psychic studies . ''

		We should expect to find the same temper prevalent in the art circles of aesthetic
France	LOCATION	; and such is indeed the case .

		I give a single example of this .

		The city of
Rheims	LOCATION	organized a few months ago a public subscrip - tion to come to the aid of `` the victims of the bombardment , '' and invited one of its ablest sculptors ,
M. Leon Chavalliaud	PERSON	, to prepare an appropriate commemorative plaquette , which he has done most artistically and at the same time most cuttingly .

		On the obverse we see the
Kaiser	PERSON	, torch in hand , skulking away over the prostrate form of a mother and her suckling babe ; in the background , the grand old cathedral in flames , while two avenging angels , with drawn glave , are driving before them the cowering imperial incendiary .

		Across the bottom of the bronze is engraved this verse of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's : Qu'est cela ?

		C'est la nuit .

		On the reverse is represented the grand square of
Rheims	LOCATION	, with the statue of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc in the centre ; in the foreground , the Gallic cock standing proudly erect on the breast of the fallen Prussian eagle , while the morning sun , rising resplendent in the background , lights up the motto of
France	LOCATION	, `` Liberty , Equality , Fraternity . ''

		At the bottom one reads the continuation of the poet 's line : Et que sera la fin T L'Aurore .

		I seize the occasion to add that
M. Chavalliaud	PERSON	is not alone in
France	LOCATION	to-day in receiving inspiration from
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, whose clear and virile poems of the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the defeat of
1870	DATE	are now on everybody 's lips .

		You see them in newspaper editorials , they are quoted in parliamentary speeches and in funeral orations , and they are sung in the hospitals to the wounded soldiers .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	was never so great in his home-land as he is at the present hour .

		Before dismissing this art object , let me say , in case any Americans may wish to aid in the good work which it promotes , that this beautiful plaquette is made of four different metals ranging in price from those in bronze at 10 francs to those in gold at 1,800 francs ; and they can be had from
M. Mirguet	PERSON	, Treasurer of the
Compagnie de Sauveteurs	ORGANIZATION	,
Rheims	LOCATION	.

		And all this fine national and patriotic spirit comes well out in the noble language of a great public man of
France	LOCATION	who flour - ished over a century before
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, whom I was quoting a moment ago ,
Guillaume du Vair	PERSON	, statesman and orator , chancellor of
France	LOCATION	during the sixteenth century and author of an admirable book , admirable espe - cially at this time , `` Traite de la Constance et Consolation es Calamities Publiques '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Recueil Sirey , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- .

		This new edition , the first in three hundred years , has been edited by the learned Professor
Jacques Flach	PERSON	, of the College of
France	LOCATION	and member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Written during the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	in the reign of
Louis XII.	LOCATION	, it is a fine example of courage and faith under great difficulties , and hence its significance and '' value to-day .

		The frontispiece is a portrait of the Chancellor , showing a strong and brave face .

		Might it not be well just now to - translate this vigorous and manly book for American readers ?

		This whole subject of civic courage suggests : the telling here of the history of one of the literary incidents of the never-to-be forgotten - or forgiven destruction of
Louvain	LOCATION	, particu - larly as I am able to give it in the words , here published for the first time , of one of the actors on the scene .

		Professor C. de la
Vallee	PERSON	-
Poussin	PERSON	, the distinguished mathematician of the late
University of Louvain	ORGANIZATION	, who spent the last college year in
America	LOCATION	, thus relates the rise and fall of one of his books : 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	The burning of
Louvain	LOCATION	, which I witnessed from beginning to end , began on the
evening	TIME	of
August 25th	DATE	, and was conducted systematically under the direction of the German authorities , who removed the inhabitants on the 27th .

		The conflagration continued until the end of the month .

		The centre of the city , with the exception of the
City Hall	LOCATION	, where were the German headquarters , was entirely destroyed .

		On the 27th or 28th , my publisher 's printing office , which was in that part of the town , was completely gutted , and a majority of the works of the professors of the university , kept there in stock , wiped out .

		That is how my `` Cours d ` Analyse '' was lost .

		The third edi - tion of Volume II .

		was in press when the catastrophe happened , the first 200 pages having been printed .

		All that is left is the series of proof-sheets which I had in my possession at the time .

		But the new mat - ter contained in that volume has been completed and published in my article which appeared in this year 's '' Transactions of the
American Mathematical Society	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This same matter will also be given in a work which is on the point of being printed in the `` Collection des
Monographies Borel	PERSON	, '' under the title , `` Integrates de Lebesgue . ''

		-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Gauthier-Villars , 3 frs . -RRB-

		The third edition of Volume I. of this work is exceedingly rare because the stock was also burnt at
Louvain	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Herman Betz	PERSON	, of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, says on this point : I have never been able to understand why this third edition of Volume I. could not be had during
1914	DATE	in bookstores or anywhere else on the continent .

		Yet when I was in
Paris	LOCATION	that year Gauthier-Villars and other concerns told me the entire supply was exhausted .

		Finally , on my return to
Germany	LOCATION	, I found one copy at
G. Fock & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's , in
Leipsic	LOCATION	, and I was told it was the only one for sale in the whole country .

		Professor
Oswald Veblen	PERSON	, of
Princeton	LOCATION	, says : `` I should guess that there are not over a dozen copies of this third edition in this country .

		I got mine second hand . ''

		Professor
M. B. Porter	PERSON	, of the
University of _ Texas	ORGANIZATION	, who has reviewed this volume in the `` Transactions of the American Mathematical Society , '' Vol - ume XX. , p. 77 , says : `` There were perhaps four copies of this third edition imported by
G. E. Stechert	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, '' and this last named firm informs me : We happen to have two copies of Volume II .

		in the second edition .

		Of Volume I. in the third edition , we secured a copy from one of our customers in order to make a photographic reprint abroad .

		This reprint may soon be finished and we hope to import some copies via
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		The reprint will be about as good as the original .

		The original publisher could not have made the reprint at the present time , such things being best done in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Naturally the
Louvain	LOCATION	publisher `` could not have made the reprint at the present time , '' his printing-office being in ashes ; but I know of at least one
Paris	LOCATION	house that could have done the work quite as well as any German house , and it is highly probable that the same thing is true of the
Clarendon Press of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Furthermore , in this way not only would the uncertainties of transporta - tion `` via
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' have been avoided , but there would be no ground for those mixed feelings , to use a mild term , which Professor de la Vallee-Poussin is sure to experience when he learns that the subjects of the same nation who ruthlessly destroyed his book and his home are imperfectly restoring the first ; and the poignancy of his dissatisfaction will not be lessened by the fact that at this moment he is seeking a refuge in
France	LOCATION	, where he was recently made a corresponding member of the
Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	in place of Pro- fessor
Felix Klein	PERSON	, of
Goettingen	LOCATION	, who resigned for `` patriotic reasons , '' as he stated .

		THEODORE
STANTON	PERSON	.


September 25 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		TREITSCHKE IN HIS LECTURE-ROOM , or in fact anywhere and in any circumstances , has an interest for us now that he would not have had three years ago .

		Hence the readiness of attention turned to one of the pages of a learned society 's report in which the famous
Berlin	LOCATION	professor figures with some of the nat - uralness of life .

		The published account of the third annual meeting of the
National Institute of Social Sciences	ORGANIZATION	has a reminiscent paper by President
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	descriptive of his first visit to
Europe	LOCATION
thirty years ago	DATE	.

		In
Berlin	LOCATION	he attended lectures at the university , and among others `` there were the
Monday	DATE
evening	TIME	popular discourses by von Treitschke , who was at the very height of his influence and power .

		To listen to these discourses was , for the first few moments , dis - tinctly disagreeable , since von
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's deafness left him without any power to control his voice .

		In consequence it was frequently almost painful to listen to his utterance .

		It was not long , however , before one forgot the utterance in the vividness and vigor of what the man was saying .

		That at the end of a generation his social and political philosophy was to shake the whole world with the evidence of its power was little dreamed of in those days .

		True , von
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's attacks on
England	LOCATION	, and on
America	LOCATION	as well , seemed even then to be very bitter and very frequent .

		But they proceeded so plainly from a complete misconception of the Anglo-Saxon character and temperament that they did not seem likely to be practically influential .

		Treitschke 's favorite complaint against both Englishmen and Americans was that they were hypocrites and nations of mere shop - keepers making pretense to the possession of cultivation .

		More than once he said , with the most astonishing emphasis , that
England	LOCATION	and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 Englishmen were lost to all idealism and that ' they possessed no national vigor .

		Interest - i ing as this was , it was not long before the ' .

		basis on which it rested made itself plain .

		Treitsehke could not understand how any nation or people could prefer common sense i to logical perfection , and so , when the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons , deterred by common sense , failed to i carry out to their logical conclusions certain professed principles of conduct , he accused them of hypocrisy . ''

		THE EVOLUTION OP LORD DUNDREARY from !

		an inconspicuous old-man part of a few lines to the highly amusing creation of which our elders have told us in their reminiscences of the elder
Sothern	PERSON	, has just been related by the latter 's son in his volume of personal recollections , one of the notable books of the season .

		The same story in its hero 's own words and handwriting , is contained in a five - page manuscript that has lately come into the possession of a
New York	LOCATION	collector , Mr.
Walter R. Benjamin	PERSON	.

		It runs in part as fol - lows : `` After being at
Laura Keene	PERSON	's Theatre three months , ` Our American Cousin ' was produced .

		The part of Dundreary was given to me .

		It was a second old man of about fifty or sixty lines at utmost , I refused to play it unless I might entirely rewrite it and put in new scenes .

		Permission was given and the piece ran about 150 nights . ''

		The ambiguous beginning of this passage refers of course to
Sothern	PERSON	's three months of not very notable work at
Laura Keene	PERSON	's Theatre before the chance offered for making a name for himself in the part of an indolent , inept , stammering English lord .

		As a matter of fact ,
Tom Taylor	PERSON	's comedy , as written by him , put but forty-seven lines into the mouth of Dundreary .

		READERS ' RAPTURE is as old as written romance .

		A classic instance from compara - tively modern times is that of the Spanish student mentioned in
Barrano Porreno	LOCATION	's `` Life and Deeds of Philip III . ''

		The king was standing one day , says the historian , on the balcony of the palace at
Madrid	LOCATION	, when his attention was arrested by the strange conduct of a student who was reading a book on the opposite bank of the
Manzanares	PERSON	and every now and then stopped to beat his forehead and make other gestures indicative of mirth and ecstasy .

		`` Yonder student , '' remarked the king , `` is either out of his wits or is read - ing the history of
Don Quixote	PERSON	. ''

		Another well-known illustration of the absorbing power of a book -LRB- this time not a work of fiction , but a romance of real life -RRB- occurs in
Boswell	PERSON	's `` Johnson . ''

		On his return from
Italy	LOCATION	Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	chanced upon
Johnson	PERSON	's life of Savage somewhere in
Devon	LOCATION	- shire and began to read it , though he knew nothing of its author , as he stood with his arm resting on a chimney-piece .

		So strongly did it seize upon his attention that he could not lay the book down until he had finished it , when to his astonishment he found his arm quite benumbed .

		Once more , and this time from an incident at the other end of the world .

		Professor
Frederick M. Padelford	PERSON	tells the following anecdote in the current vol - ume of the `` Journal of the
National Institute of Social Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, '' his paper being entitled `` The National Growth in Culture . ''

		He says : `` One day I chanced to be in the circulation room of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and I noticed a man , rather shabbily dressed and rather grimy in appearance , doubled over a table and so absorbed in his book that he had not taken time to sit down .

		There he hung in an agony of interest , one leg twisted around the leg of the table by way of anchorage .

		My curiosity got the best of me , and I was rude enough to glance at the title of the book It was the ` Metaphysics of Aristotle ! '

		Well , if this man was reading that book , what were the other fifty men reading ? ''

		Many besides the hero of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's little poem eat and drink the precious words of a good book .

		POPULAR APPRECIATION OP IMAGISM AND FREE VERSE exceeds expectation and gives food for thought as to the enduring merits of these latest forms of imaginative literature .

		It is significant that our large public libraries are recording a growing demand for the poems of certain recent writers whom the more con - servative refuse to recognize as poets at all .

		Whatever our personal preferences , however much we may prefer `` In Memoriam '' to the `` Spoon River Anthology , '' we can not blink the fact that the love of poetry now noted with approval where formerly the love of fiction held undisputed sway , is not confined to appreciation of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Interesting evi - dence of this popular liking for later writers , in this domain of literature is furnished by the observant official in charge of the open - shelf room , as it is called , in the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		She reports : `` In point of issue , the most noteworthy fact has been the sudden interest attaching to modern poetry .

		The work of the great poets has never lacked appreciation , but the contrary has been true of those untried by time , up to the present 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19 year	DATE	, when the greatest demand for present - day poets , such as
Masefield	ORGANIZATION	,
Noyes	PERSON	,
Bynner	PERSON	,
Masters	ORGANIZATION	, the Imagists and writers of free verse has developed .

		Masters 's ` Spoon River Anthology ' has never found a place on the regular shelves , having been steadily reserved since its publication , while ' The Poetry Jour - nal ' is in constant demand .

		That this interest is general is evident from the assertions of the book-sellers , whose sales along this line have been amazingly large . ''

		LITERATURE OP POWER VERSUS LITERATURE OP KNOWLEDGE seems in a certain manifest sense a too grossly manifest sense , it may be objected to have got the worst of it , for the time being at least .

		Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	and
Wieland	PERSON	and Herder have gone down before
Treitschke	PERSON	and
Bernhardi	PERSON	and a few others of that truculent company .

		At a meeting of the
New York Library Asso	LOCATION	- ciation a year ago Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	delivered himself , in a characteristic and highly acceptable manner , of some rather acidulous reflections on the public library 's place and work in the world of to-day .

		His remarks , unlike the cut-and-dried addresses commonly heard in such conferences , pictured unsparingly the undeniable paucity of influ - ence exerted by the library on the progress of events and the destinies of nations .

		In accents of something like bitterness and cha - rgrin he went on : `` Some have said to me that it were better for mankind if in my own library work I put less emphasis on industry and more on culture and uplift ; less on mere `` books and more on books of power ; less on directories and more on
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Henry Van Dyke	ORGANIZATION	.

		And I must reply by saying that the nations that have most freely wal - lowed for several centuries in ` books of power ' are the ones which are now wading deepest in one another 's blood . ''

		Neverthe - less there is at least a possibility of fallacy in the implied argument the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc .

		How immeasurably more deplorable might have been the world 's condition to-day if it had never worked its way up to a literature of power !

		EDITORIAL COLLOQUIALISMS , or , in less stilted phrase , slang from the sanctum , may be found rather freely used in those neat little notes - of regretful rejection with which it is appar - ently expected that the pang of getting back an unacceptable manuscript will be rendered less poignant .

		At first it used to suffice to allege `` unavailability '' in a rejected offering ; and this would tend to elicit the indignant even though unuttered query , `` Why unavail - able ?

		A thing is unavailable when it can not be availed of or turned to use ; and that is just what no one can truthfully say of my story -LSB- or poem , or essay -RSB- , which is the most available thing ever written . ''

		Later it would be politely objected by the courteous editor that the contribution so unwillingly returned by him was somewhat lacking in appeal , or failed to convince , or showed a deficiency of compelling power .

		Still later it became cus - tomary to affect a sort of jocular sympathy with the unfortunate one in his or her fruit - less attempt to carry the editorial outworks , and perhaps the contributor 's failure to `` put it over '' this time would be rendered less dis - appointing by an invitation to `` come back '' with something else in the near future .

		The
October	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' has a short humorous - satiric essay on `` Some Keasons for Being Rejected , '' and among the reasons are alleged lack of `` ginger , '' of `` pep , '' of `` kick , '' and of `` punch . ''

		After all , is it of much use to try to sugar-coat the pill of rejection ?

		By any writer of experience the refusal of a man - uscript can be gulped down in its unsweet - ened form with less of nausea than when soaked in a saccharine solution .

		CRITICIZING THE CRITICS has long been a peculiarly gratifying exercise of intellectual acumen among those who find their delight in splitting hairs .

		If the critical scholarship of a Wolf could demolish the traditional Homer , how much more glorious must it be to over - throw Wolf !

		Augustus De Morgan , para - phrasing Swift , printed in his `` Budget of Paradoxes '' some witty lines , beginning : Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em , And little fleas have lesser fleas , and so ad infin - itum .

		The last and least in this chain of parasites probably imagines itself the lord of all the rest .

		Among the season 's books is a bright and thoughtful treatise by Mr.
James P. Kelley	PERSON	on the right use of English `` Work - manship in Words '' in which the author takes occasion to criticize the critics , and among them Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Not in a malicious or unworthy spirit is this done , however , but rather with the feeling that , as the author expresses it , `` he who does anything for the right use of words , does so much for character , for conduct , for happi - ness , '' and that careless writing is discourtesy to the reader .

		Protest is rightly raised against
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 301 the incorrect use of `` shall '' and `` will , '' though it might have sufficed to censure the wrong use of `` will '' alone , since `` shall '' has become almost obsolete with the mass of cur - rent writers .

		Another useful book that this season has produced in the same branch of critical scholarship is Miss
Dora K. Ranous	PERSON	's `` Good English in Good Form . ''

		Here there is no calling of names , no citing of specific instances of error from designated authors ; and a captious reader should feel the less incentive to pick flaws in the work .

		Neverthe - less he might remark with some surprise that so correct a writer and so keen a detective of even minor mistakes allows herself to write : `` However one may find his subject , in order to do good work he should always look up the facts regarding it , wherever they can be found . ''

		For `` his '' and `` he '' a careful writer might be expected to substitute `` one 's '' and `` one , '' or it would perhaps be better to remodel the sentence .

		It is an endless game of chase , this criticism of critics , and doubt - less leads too often -LRB- as this very paragraph is in danger of illustrating -RRB- to an absurd exalta - tion of trifles .

		READING AND TEACHING do not always go hand in hand .

		Just as the author who was questioned as to his favorite books proudly replied , `` I do n't read books ; I write 'em , '' so the teacher , if similarly interrogated , might be tempted to answer , `` It is not my function to acquire knowledge , but to impart it . ''

		In a manual just issued in its second annual edi - tion and entitled `` A Handbook of American Private Schools '' a notably full and well - informed volume of anonymous editorship , but presumably compiled by its publisher , Mr.
Porter E. Sargent	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	the more dryly statistical body of the book is preceded by a number of papers on educational topics ; and among them is a short account of `` Recent Educational Literature , '' by Profes - sor
Clayton C. Kohl	PERSON	, of
New York University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He quotes from a trustworthy source the number of our last year 's books and other writings on education as not far from two thousand , but adds : `` In spite of the fact that the literature of pedagogy is so rich as it is , and so cheap as things go , the fact remains that teachers in service read very little and buy few books .

		The thoughtful reading of one good book each month , a very simple and easy requirement , would work wonders in the teaching profession . ''

		It may be that the writer over-estimates the number of unreading teachers , or he may under-esti - mate their number ; but we all know of more than a few instances of teachers who do read .

		Perhaps their bright example blinds us to the large body of those who -LRB- to use a homely met - aphor -RRB- try to give out at the spigot without putting in at the bung-hole .

		BETTER THAN A READING ROOM , in many emergencies , is a writing room .

		All public libraries have their reading rooms , or , at the very least , some corner or alcove or table where the reader may consider himself in some degree secured from interruption and assured of quiet .

		Not many libraries have their well-appointed writing rooms ; in fact , only one public library has specialized in this direction , and that is the
St. Louis	LOCATION	institu - tion under the competent management of Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	.

		His innovation of two years ago was appreciatively mentioned in these columns soon after its introduction , and now it gives satisfaction to note the evident increasing success of this elaborately equipped department .

		Used at first almost entirely by persons out of work and desirous of turning an honest penny with the pen , or of answer - ing `` want '' advertisements , it is now resorted to more generally and even attracts out-of - town visitors , who often come to the library purposely to see its writing room and to write a letter home `` to tell the folks what
St. Louis	LOCATION	has that we have n't , '' as one man expressed it .

		Its free service to all includes pens , ink , and letter-heads , while for a reason - able fee other valuable service is rendered .

		Its custodian is a public stenographer and a notary public , ready to serve all comers at current rates .

		Special assistance in research work , copying , compiling , the preparation of manuscript for publication , and similar serv - ices , may here be obtained , as is to be gath - ered from the current yearly Report of the library to which it has brought some little addition of more than local repute .

		SOME ASPECTS OP SUPERANNUATION , particu - larly among those engaged in intellectual pursuits , are presented in a practical and at the same time rather entertaining manner in what might at first seem a formidable and uninteresting document , namely , `` Bulletin Number Nine '' of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	.

		It con - tains `` A Comprehensive Plan of Insurance and Annuities for
College Teachers	ORGANIZATION	, '' by the president of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Henry S. Pritehett	PERSON	.

		The reader learns , among other things , that retired teachers prove to be so abnormally tenacious of life their mortality rate is so `` far below the most conservative 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	tables '' that the Carnegie pension fund is in danger of serious strain as the years roll and the pensioners grow both in number and in vigorous old age .

		Here is a sidelight on the condition and habits of these veterans : `` Only a single teacher gives expression to the feeling that he has found retirement irksome .

		Others , according to health and inclination , have enjoyed their well-earned leisure in read - ing , in rural life , in travel , or have continued in varying measure their former occupations .

		Physical activity has varied from little or none to that of a professor of seventy-one , who built a house , constructed and played on three tennis courts , and wrote a book , all in one year . ''

		Is it any wonder that there is felt to be room for a contributory system of annu - ities and insurance `` in which the teacher , his college , and the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	may cooperate , '' and `` which shall rest upon a true social philosophy and upon a sound financial basis '' ?

		To such a supplementary system the writer gives his earnest attention in the sixty and more broad pages of the pamphlet .

		THE STARTLING STYLE is hardly a compli - ment to the reader 's intellectual powers .

		It implies a drowsiness in him that needs every other instant to be dispelled by violent means , rather than an alert intelligence open to all that is of real interest and importance .

		How many French writers , especially the feuille - tonist es -LRB- there seems to be not even an approx - imate English equivalent for this word -RRB- , offend by straining to arrest attention !

		So great a genius as
Victor Hugo	PERSON	did not disdain the cheaply sensational in literary method .

		In periodical literature the explosive manner is , of course , a commonplace ; and among our own periodicals there is one not widely cir - culated
New York	LOCATION	weekly that challenges attention as at the pistol 's point .

		Its amus - ingly appropriate name is `` The Bang . ''

		It proclaims itself `` issued every week by its editor , '' and it is open to surmise that it is also written by him .

		That it is now in its eleventh half-year speaks volumes -LRB- ten of them -RRB- for its staying power .

		It is evidently no pop-gun repercussion , no toy torpedo crack , no flash in the pan , but a resonant and prolonged bang !

		Long may it reverberate !

		Its many-paragraphed , generously leaded col - umns are certainly of a sort that he who runs may read .

		Here are a few examples of its short , widely spaced paragraphs , all from a recent issue : `` Think of it ! ''

		`` In vain ! ''

		`` The plates are taken . ''

		`` That settles it . ''

		`` Yes , yes ! ''

		Printed in large , clear type , and thus cut up into short and easy portions , it almost recalls by its appearance the primer of our first happy school days .

		But it lacks the woodcuts , and , to be truthful , its matter is far in advance of the primer grade .

		* LITERATURE FOR LADIES receives some amus - ingly sarcastic jabs from a sharp-pointed pen in the current `` Unpopular Review . ''

		The pen , if one were to venture a guess , might be located in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, in the deft and practiced hand of Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	; but nothing is more hazardous than to try to lift the veil of anonymity .

		Whoever the writer , the writing is certainly highly readable .

		`` Why is it , I wonder , '' she asks , `` that the women 's periodicals , always shrilly asseverat - ing their noble ideal of Woman , are nearly all carefully adapted in their text to infantile or arrested intelligence ? ''

		And in plaus - ible explanation she replies : `` However , it has occurred to me as a comforting reflection that a probable explanation of all this is that most of the women 's periodicals at any rate those with the most glaring ear-marks of their type -LRB- Can an ear-mark glare ?

Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	's
Scot	PERSON	- tish associations , and also indirectly through the courtesy of Mr.

		I was duly favoured with your letter of the 28 optimo and have pleasure in sending you the following information which I hope will be of interest .

		Mr.
James Anderson	PERSON	died 26
December , 1887	DATE	, aged 84 , son of the late Mr.
William Anderson	PERSON	, Session Clerk for this Parish and in early life was accountant in the
Union Bank	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a long period he was auditor for the corporation of
Kilmarnock	LOCATION	, acting trustee as well as Secretary and Treasurer of
Bellfield Trust	ORGANIZATION	, latterly Chair - man and Treasurer .

		He was born and brought up in the
Townsend	LOCATION	, near the head of Nelson Street , within a few yards of the house occupied by the late Mr.
Allan Fowlds	PERSON	-LRB- which was removed some years ago -RRB- and he had a distinct recollection of playing as a boy with
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	when that ill-starred genius spent a few weeks in
Kilmarnock	LOCATION	, along with his guardian Mr.
Allan	PERSON	of
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, on a visit to Mr.
Fowlds	PERSON	' who was his brother-in-law .

		Mr.
Whitty	PERSON	notes that
Anderson	PERSON	remembered
Poe	PERSON	as `` a curmudgeon , but self - willed , '' and as `` much petted by the Allans . ''

		Poe was seven , and
Anderson	PERSON	, thirteen years old at that time .

		From the first the latter must have had vivid recollections of the former .

		It is a thou - sand pities that his recollections could not have been jotted down at the time , that the fine comb of research which has been so industriously applied to

		WILL SHAKESPEARE 'S EARNINGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In this peculiarly Shakespearean year , now passing , it may be of somewhat general interest to try and reach a reasonable reply to the not infre - quently asked question : `` What did Will of Strat - ford make , financially , from his ' play-acting ' and writing ? ''

		I heard the matter debated recently by those who should know , if familiarity with
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan life and letters counts for anything , and I venture to pass along to THE DIAL audience the outcome .

		The author of `` Macbeth , '' `` Hamlet , '' and `` King Lear '' is said to have received twenty pounds a year from his written plays , and five or six times as much for his acting , say one hundred and thirty pounds each twelfth-month in all .

		Allowing for the difference in money values then and now , this would mean a purchasing power of probably
$ 8,000	MONEY	a year , possibly
$ 10,000	MONEY	.

		The usual purchase price for a play through the
closing years of the sixteenth century	DATE	was from six to fourteen or fifteen pounds , while the rate advanced so slowly even during another century and a half that the records show
Dick Steele	PERSON	receiving only twenty-two pounds for '' The Lying Lover . ''

		Farquhar thirty for his `` Beaux 's Strata - gem , '' and Southerne thirty-six for his phenom - inally successful `` Fatal Marriage . ''

		One imagines Barrie making considerably more than that each week , in royalties , while there is
Charlie Chaplin	PERSON	earning a litte matter of
$ 1,835.34	MONEY	daily ,
Sundays	DATE	and holidays included .

		And I once heard of a mere laboring man who got a dollar a word , though that was for talking back to a judge .

October 19	DATE	THE Two CANDIDATES .

		* When
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	gave up to
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	what was meant for mankind , he did not know of how numerous a progeny he would be the inspiring ancestor .

		What he did supremely well , Mr.
Creel	PERSON	and Judge Ransom have done in a curiously undistin - guished fashion .

		Mr.
Creel	PERSON	's volume has the single merit of vigor ; but it makes of caution and soberness most complete and boisterous abstractions .

		His book is a very jolly book , and it doubtless springs from an intimate conviction ; but it fails to impress one as based upon any careful consideration of the facts at issue .

		Judge
Ransom	PERSON	's compilation is admirable when he quotes from Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's judicial opinions ; but a verbatim reprint of the latter would have been far more serviceable .

		As it is , the quotations break off exactly at the point where they become really interesting ; and the constant intru - sion of Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	's hyperbolic and rhetor - ical explanations becomes at once irritating and unintelligent .

		Neither of these explanations explain .

		We are still faced by the enigma of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's mysticism on the one hand , and the problem of Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's possibilities on the other .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is a mystery which the useful little reprint of one of his early lectures , `` The President of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' does but little to explain .

		He might easily have been one of the first men of letters in
America	LOCATION	.

		When still a young man he wrote a book on American government which is not only unequalled in its critical sagacity , but even challenges comparison with the best European work in a similar field .

		In the nineties he wrote some essays on Bagehot which are unquestionably the most brilliant study of the English De Tocqueville .

		He has written a history of the
United States	LOCATION	which , while it is not to be taken seriously as a work of research , is yet not unworthy of that delicate age when it was the fashion for high-souled gentlemen to embark upon a formidable lit - erary enterprise .

		why its author was a successful teacher of political science ; and if his face was , through - out his educational career , set firmly towards the declining sun of an ungenial
Benthamism	PERSON	, still his work seems to have been influential and important .

		When he became Governor of
New Jersey	LOCATION	he had an admirable oppor - tunity to give his theories the practical test of experimental proof .

		Certainly he was a not - able Governor ; and his elevation to the high - est office democratic government can offer was an intelligible tribute to the enthusiasm he inspired .

		It is curious to read the history of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's Presidency in the light of his own interpretation of it .

		The expert who had spent his life in the formulation of theories to meet the concrete event became again as a little child .

		He seemed to foresee nothing and to plan for nothing .

		He waited for the advent of crises , and then allowed himself to be pushed boldly into mid-stream in the certainty that the current must secure his movement .

		His tenure of office has been the apotheosis of opportunism .

		This may be , as Mr.
Creel	PERSON	says , the expression of `` almost mystic pas - sions '' ; but the difficulty to an external observer is to find the sense of mastery in his inactivity .

		Passion , however mystic , is of little avail unless it is harnessed to thought ; and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	seems to lack entirely any coherent scheme of deliberate endeavor .

		He has been unwilling , almost , to adjust himself to changing ideals and changed necessities .

		He has been singularly unreceptive to criti - cism ; and it is hardly sufficient response to urge , as Mr.
Creel	PERSON	does so anxiously , that no president has been so unsparingly criticised .

		He has rarely welcomed inquiry .

		The very people he might have been expected to wel - come he has denounced .

		For the administra - tive efficiency of which he so continually emphasized the importance , he has done prac - tically nothing .

		His economic attitude has been too often the erection of laissez-faire into a dogma . ''

		Governments , '' he has himself said , `` are what the politicians make them , '' yet he has rarely admitted their creative possibilities until they have been thrust upon him .

		Though he has written of presidential leadership as the enforcement of the president 's views upon the people , his practical demonstration of his faith has been the watchful regard of the fluctuat - ing currents of the inconstancies of public opinion .

		Mr.
Creel	PERSON	has a high regard for Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's foreign policy ; yet even his enthu - siasm finds it difficult to extract from Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's notes any genuine indication of con - sistent purpose .

		Yet there have undoubtedly been great moments in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's tenure
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 of office .

		He spoke finely when he pledged
America	LOCATION	to the construction of a new world .

		He spoke finely when , in the midst of the threatened railway strike , he made the coun - try understand , as it had never understood before , the social significance of leisure and of rest .

		But he enunciated neither policy until events had driven him to the utterance .

		He seems to be capable of acts , but unwilling to admit the ideas which underlie them ; and the acts are always of that hasty character which betray the absence of coherent and connected thought .

		The enigma of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is simply why a man who has spent the greater part of his life in the teaching of politics should be so unwilling to lend to its practice the aid of scientific method .

		Everything he wrote before
1912	DATE	was a hymn to its praise .

		Since that time he has sought the beatification of the average man .

		He has abandoned the lonely path of the trained thinker for that lonelier avenue where conclusions are gained from mystic intuitions incapable of logical demon - stration .

		What Mr.
Creel	PERSON	fails to understand is the disconcerting fact that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's tenure of office makes us seriously wonder if it is ever to be possible to train men for high political office , or whether the best training is totally to neglect the opportunity for expe - rience and inference .

		Mr.
Creel	PERSON	is so obsessed by this large democratisation of intelligence which is implied in the `` average man '' theory of government that he does not sufficiently realize its other implications .

		In the complex future that lies ahead it would be a distres - sing thing if
America	LOCATION	were compelled to depend on the incompetent benevolence of untrained amateurs .

		There is really some - thing to be said for wholesale and forehanded thinking .

		There is really something to be said for the mobilisation of trained political intelligence .

		The scepticism Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	raises is something of which Mr.
Creel	PERSON	is entirely unaware .

		It is , of course , a scepti - cism not of a man but of a system .

		It is the scepticism which refuses to believe that any man has the right to neglect the power of organized political thought .

		And that scepti - cism is the more convincing when it is remem - bered that precisely this lesson it was for long Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's privilege insistently to inculcate .

		If Mr.
Creel	PERSON	leaves problems unanswered , Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	does not wholly resolve some kindred hesitations of Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	.

		The latter was an able governor of
New York	LOCATION	, courageous and fearless even if he was rarely inspired .

		As a judge the mere record of his opinions is evidence that he never stopped learning .

		His mind showed , as the great opinions in the rate cases make evident , an amazing power of growing to the issues he was called upon to decide .

		Yet the difficulty his campaign has raised is emphatically the difficulty of igno - rance .

		His speeches have been sincere and fair minded , but they resemble his
Yale	ORGANIZATION	lec - tures on Citizenship in their unerring instinct for the antique and the obvious .

		He seems , when he is away from judicial issues , to mis - take truisms for truths .

		He does not seem to have caught the challenge of a new age .

		The
Yale	ORGANIZATION	lectures revealed curious stretches of ignorance which are as disconcerting as they are dangerous .

		We know that he believes passionately in good administration ; that of which we feel uncertain is as to whether he is aware of the issues about which he will have to administrate .

		It is not enough to believe in a democracy of expert agents ; the trouble is that it is the president who decides their commissions .

		His fine attitude to the Frank case showed how keenly he believes in justice .

		But so , probably , does Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	; and so does , in the abstract at least ,
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the abstract conception is worth - less until it is turned into terms of the con - crete happinesses of men and women .

		Judge Ransom brings out clearly Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's belief in the necessity for continuous thought before action is taken ; but he does not convey the assurance that Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	is really aware of the issues upon which thought is essential .

		Many of his remarks on the labor problem , for instance , read like the utterances of a Rip Van Winkle who went to sleep about the time of the Civil War .

		He tells us confidently that if he is elected , he will rule .

		No one can read Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	's book without gaining the assur - ance that Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has the character and sincerity to live up to that significant decision .

		But one feels about his theories what it is so difficult not to feel about Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's prac - tice the fear that his thought comes too late to give social satisfaction .

		Legislation is a science and not a guesswork competition ; yet a certain speed is essential .

		We are not immortal , and Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's mind will be out - side the dignified leisure of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will no longer be able to weigh nicely this argument and that , to amble gently in the restful shades of countless pre - cedents .

		He will be called upon to make a mass of immediate judgments upon problems he has never confronted .

		The central fact Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	does not face is the serious one that Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may , if he is elected , meet in less than six months .

		He fails to see that it is placing an enormous burden upon the interval to expect Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	to acquaint himself at all fully with the issues 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	of to-morrow .

		`` Success in a lottery , ''
Bagehot	PERSON	once remarked , `` is no argument for lotteries . ''

		The revelation Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	gives us of his mind suggests that we are again gambling in incredible futures .

		But the suc - cess of
1860	DATE	ought to remind us that political aloes have a rigid habit of blossoming but once in a century .

		Books like these enforce an obvious lesson .

		They are unsatisfactory because they fail so entirely to realize the larger issues involved in the problems they raise .

		The election of
1916	DATE	will pass away ; but the fundamental prob - ' lems of government which are personified in the characters of its protagonists remain and oppress us .

		There is no sovereign remedy against the need of thought .

		From ceaseless analysis and ceaseless interpretation the char - acter of our age will give us no release .

		And it is better to face squarely that supreme fact rather than emulate the reckless pamphleteer - ing of Mr.
Creel	PERSON	on the one hand or the rhet - orical documentation of Mr.
Eansom	PERSON	on the other .

		It is otherwhere that salvation lies .


HAROLD J. LASKI	PERSON	.

		AN ACTOR 'S REMEMBRANCES .

		Born of a handsome and gifted father whose name still recalls vivid memories of excellent acting and some unusually clever practical jokes , and of a beautiful and impulsive mother who also in her time trod the boards , Mr.
Edward H. Sothern	PERSON	has no lack of stage reminiscences and other personal and family history and anecdote with which to fill a book .

		His younger brother , named
George	PERSON	and therefore called Sam by the father and `` Ta '' by himself , the nurse ,
Sarah Tame	PERSON	, nick - named `` Kluklums , '' the incurably romantic Uncle

		The gift of dramatic narrative , as well as that of dramatic impersonation , is agreeably evident in Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	; and though he goes to excess in his presentation of the objectified `` Me '' in his earlier chapters , and needlessly mystifies us with his `` fairy godmother '' throughout , he writes with the pen of a born story-teller the pen of one who can be depended upon not to spoil a good story in * THE MELANCHOLY TALE OF `` Ms. '' My Remembrances .

		the telling .

		Among the illustrations , too , there are evidences of the actor-author 's talent in still another branch of art .

		How much further his versatility extends , the reader is left to conjecture .

		Yet , strange as it may seem , the son of `` Dundreary ''
Sothern	PERSON	showed in his first dramatic attempts a decided inaptitude for the stage , so that even the presumably for - bearing father was moved to say to him emphatically : `` It 's no use ; you 'd better give up the stage , '' and the manager chimed in with a decisive , `` No , he wo n't do .

		Eddy has not the mouth for an orator . ''

		But whether he followed the example of Demos - thenes in curing his defect of speech , or applied some less strenuous remedy , it was not many years before he found himself billed as a star in letters so tall that he feared he could never live up to them .

		Among the actors not yet famous , but destined to achieve fame , with whom Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	struggled for a foothold in his profession were
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	,
Joseph Haworth	PERSON	,
Cyril Maude	PERSON	, and others of equal note .

		He relates a desperate adventure in
Chicago	LOCATION	, where `` Called Back '' and `` Lost '' were played to almost empty houses until courage was lost and one of the company , at least , was called back to
New York	LOCATION	by a timely telegram offering an engage - ment .

		This was accepted and , in the author 's words descriptive of his conquest of success , I played in `` Favette '' and failed .

		I played in another play , `` Mona , '' with
Miss Dauvray	PERSON	, and I met with some success .

		I was engaged then for
Bronson Howard	PERSON	's new play , `` One of Our Girls . ''

		I was so bad at rehearsal that
Frazer Coulter	PERSON	was secured to take my place .

		Suddenly I began to develop a bit , and was permitted to play the part of Captain
Gregory	PERSON	.

		Fortune favored me in that character , and the sun began to shine .

		It is clear from Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	's chronicle that he made his way to the front on his own merits , not on his father 's .

		Indeed , he seems to have received on the road some rude reminders that talent is not always heredi - tary , and it is very possible that the elder
Sothern	PERSON	's celebrity was a handicap and not a help to the younger .

		Yet the father in his time had fought his own hard battles with adversity .

		At the age of twenty-five , with no fewer than 396 parts in his repertory , he had written from
England	LOCATION	to the manager of the
National Theatre	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, asking for an engagement , and was promptly taken on for leading comedy parts .

		But , as his son unspar - ingly relates the painful episode , His failure was so complete that the audience in an uproar interfered with the progress of the play -LSB- `` The Heir-at-Law , '' in which the imported star attempted to impersonate Doctor
Pangloss	PERSON	-RSB- .

		My father approached the footlights , holding up his hand
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 307 for silence , which having been granted , he said : `` Ladies and gentlemen , if you will permit me to finish the play I will go home and learn how to act . ''

		He was allowed to continue and at the end of the performance he was discharged for incapacity .

		It was no unusual thing then , especially in
England	LOCATION	, for audiences to declare their displeasure with the utmost violence .

		Only so lately as the year
1825	DATE	had
Edmund Kean	PERSON	been hooted from the stage of a
Boston	LOCATION	theatre .

		But the unappreciated English actor , in this instance , `` accepted his dismissal with the buoyancy of youth , fortified perhaps by the distresses of greater actors than himself , and applied with a light heart to the manager of the
Howard Athenaeum	PERSON	, '' where he was engaged at
nine dollars	MONEY	a week to play two new parts each week , with two performances a day .

		It was in
Boston	LOCATION	that the memorable friendship was formed between the elder
Sothern	PERSON	and Mrs.
Vincent	PERSON	a friendship bequeathed at his death to his son , who records that `` to the last of her days she could never speak of him without uncontrollable laughter '' at the memory of his mad pranks .

		In her memoirs she calls her old friend `` the most impudent , audacious , good-for-nofhing , good-hearted fellow . ''

		Here is an incident touching the two : Mrs.
Vincent	PERSON	, all her life long , was devoted to a modest and quiet charity , and she found at once a ready disciple in my father .

		Early in their friend - ship he deposited with her a magic hundred dollars which was never to grow less .

		When , in the course of her ministrations to the unfortunate the low-water mark of twenty dollars was reached , my father was to be notified and the balance restored .

		When Mrs.
Vincent	PERSON	died , a twenty-dollar bill was found by Miss
Mina Berntsen	PERSON	under the paper of her bureau drawer where she habitually kept it part of this fairy fund which had maintained its evergreen quality for twenty years .

		To return to the subject of the autobiog - raphy , Mr.
Edward H. Sothern	PERSON	records mid - way in his book , the place and .

		date of his birth , and adds that his father , `` careful to remember unimportant details , made a mem - orandum in a scrap-book of theatrical notices ; among other notes , such as the sum due his landlady , and the number and variety of arti - cles of clothing in the wash , he had jotted down : `
December 6 , 1859	DATE	, 4
A. M.	PERSON	, 79 Bien - ville Street ,
New Orleans	LOCATION	, boy born . ' ''

		A baby may be mislaid , remarks the author , and it is always wise to make notes .

		To the father of
Kate Claxton	PERSON	the happy father of the infant wrote : `` Dear Cone : The long expected youth has at last arrived .

		The very first thing he did was to sneeze , so the least we can do is to call him
Dundreary Sothern	PERSON	. ''

		At this time
Edward A. Sothern	PERSON	was playing in a stock company in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		His son writes : It was shortly after the successful production of `` Our American Cousin '' at
Laura Keene	PERSON	's Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	.

		This present enterprise was my father 's venture , and the theatre was called for the occasion ''
Sothern	PERSON	's Varieties . ''

		Here a large and varied repertoire was played , my mother doing her share of this work and even adapting a drama from the French , called in English `` Suspense , '' which was a great success .


Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	and
John T. Raymond	PERSON	were members of the organization .

		Anecdotes of actors are , oftener than not , amusing and worth repeating ; hence the temptation to `` lift , '' as the expressive collo - quialism puts it , a considerable number of choice little stories from Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	's chatty pages .

		But even his snappiest stories cover some space , and few of them would look quite right out of their setting , therefore the best course to follow is to commend the book 's entertaining quality to the reader who knows it not already from the pages of the period - ical that first gave in serial form the greater part , at least , of these richly reminiscent chapters .

		Old stage favorites , not a few , are met with again , and the illustrations second the pen in recalling many a face and many a part dear to the veteran theatre-goer .

		Many people , including well - known statesmen and members of the bar , have admiringly exploited `` this rough back - woodsman '' as practicing in the courts upon the results of `` random reading , on the wing , of a few miscellaneous law books '' and `` with - out a library , '' at a time when `` common sense , force of character , .

		.

		ready wit and power of speech .

		.

		supplied all the defi - ciencies of learning . ''

		Lincoln 's biographers have done surprisingly little to draw his por - trait as a lawyer with true perspective .

		They have too often sought to make mere anecdotes take the place of facts , possibly because it requires time and pains to discover and verify facts .

		Mr.
Richards	PERSON	's book will go far toward remanding to the class of juvenilia the aver - age biographical treatment of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's legal history .

		Moreover , it has been little suspected that the greatness of Lincoln 's statesmanship rested potently upon his greatness as a lawyer .

		This is the thesis supported by Mr.
Richards	PERSON	, whose first chapter is concerned with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's early education and initiation into law and politics .

		Nothing new is attempted in these points .

		The absence of college training and a natural thirst for knowledge imposed the necessity of self - instruction , which became a life habit .

		Con - sidering
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's native abilities , these facts appear sufficient to explain the remarkably good English he employed at the age of twenty-three , and the mastery of State prob - lems he had acquired as a member of the legislature before his admission to the bar in
1837	DATE	.

		Lincoln 's education has been subjected to as much speculation , often as wide of the mark , as his law practice .

		His intellectual attainments ascribed , for example , in a well - known essay by a distinguished American educator , to genius , are rightly attributed by Mr.
Richards	PERSON	to `` deep study . ''

		As a matter of fact ,
Lincoln	PERSON	was one of the best educated men of his day .

		This result happened , too , as Professor
Emerton	PERSON	shows it happened in the case of
Erasmus	LOCATION	, `` by the only pedagogical method which ever yet produced any results anywhere , namely , by the method of his own tireless energy in study and practice . ''

		There is probably very little necessity for the myth of genius when the facts of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's study habits and passion for knowledge are properly appreciated .

		Although Lincoln 's education was by no means limited to the study and practice of law , that subject formed the core of his train - ing .

		Mr.
Richards	PERSON	can not agree with those biographers who assert that
Lincoln	PERSON	was not a great and well-read lawyer .

		He contends that `` no careful student of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's career at the bar can arrive at any other con - clusion than that he was thoroughly familiar with the standard works of his day on the various branches of the law . ''

		There is , of course , a popular conception of Lincoln as riding the circuit on horseback , swapping stories with his colleagues of a verdant west - ern bar , en route , and at the county seat tav - erns , and winning small cases by the superior - ity of his witty appeals to the bucolic jurors of the day .

		The impressive array of evidence brought forward in this volume successfully contradicts
Lincoln	LOCATION	's humble position as a lawyer .


Leonard Swett	PERSON	's declaration that he never knew Lincoln 's superior before a jury is first-class testimony on the forensic side , for
Swett	PERSON	was one of the most learned lawyers in the country at that time .

		Judge
David Davis	PERSON	, of the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, averred that `` in all the elements that constitute a great lawyer he -LSB- Lincoln -RSB- had few equals .

		He was great both at nisi prius and before an appellate tribunal . ''

		Similar testimony was given by
Thomas Drummond	PERSON	of the
United States Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	and by
Sidney Breese	PERSON	and
John D. Caton	PERSON	, of
the Supreme Court of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's most incontrovertible evidence is to be found in an Appendix to the volume , in which he gives brief summaries of one hundred and seventy-five cases in
the Supreme Court of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	in which Lincoln appeared as counsel .

		Two additional sum - maries are given of cases in
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, to the bar of which Lincoln was admitted in
1849	DATE	, following his term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the first of these cases
Chief Justice Taney	ORGANIZATION	rendered the decision against
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's contentions ; in the second case , in which Lincoln won ,
Salmon P. Chase	ORGANIZATION	appeared as counsel on the other side .

		As the author points out , such a record as this in the higher courts would be exceptional to - day ; and this is not to mention the record of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's practice in the lower courts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon the basis of his estimate of Lincoln as a lawyer , Mr.
Richards	PERSON	devotes one of his best chapters to a review of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's policies as President .

		He classifies our Presidents into those who `` have not hesitated to take upon themselves .

		.

		powers granted to coordi - nate branches of the government whenever they have believed that the general welfare required it . ''

		Lincoln , however , together with
Madison	PERSON	,
John Adams	PERSON	, and
Jefferson	PERSON	, he places in the other and greater class , because of their thorough understanding of the consti - tutional limitations circumscribing the execu -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 309 tive .

		Irrespective of this mootable observation , one has no difficulty in discovering
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's profound respect for law .

		`` Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe ... Let it be taught in the schools , in seminaries , in col - leges ... Let it be preached from the pul - pit ; proclaimed in legislative halls , and enforced in courts of justice ... Let it become the political religion of the nation . ''

		These were
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's words as early as
1837	DATE	.

		Their spirit lay behind his later declarations on capital and labor , as well as on other sub - jects .

		Indeed , there is some ground for believing with Mr.
Richards	PERSON	that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's knowledge of the principles of the Constitu - tion has never been surpassed by any Amer - ican statesman .

		Reasons in support of this opinion exist in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's works , as well as in support of the author 's belief , already widely held , that had Lincoln lived the handling of the negro prob - lem would have been simplified and made the occasion of less passion and injustice than was actually engendered .

		Lincoln 's writings amply exhibit his opposition to unrestricted negro suffrage , to `` carpet-bag '' government , and to the act which placed the election machinery of the rebellious States under the control of the national government .

		He would doubtless have had recourse to the election laws existing in the
States	LOCATION	before `` the so - called act of secession . ''

		This view of his reconstruction policy , had he lived to carry it out , seems to be reasonably supported by his proclamations of
December 8 , 1863	DATE	, and
July 8 , 1864	DATE	.

		Supplementing in several important respects what is already available concerning
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is the charmingly readable book by Mr.
Henry B. Rankin	PERSON	, who , at the age of eighty , contributes his `` Personal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln . ''

		As a young man just out of college , Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	read law in the office of
Lincoln	LOCATION	and
Herndon	PERSON	for several years and possessed unusual opportunity to know the two men well .

		He writes with the dignity and calm of a ripe judgment .

		There is no attempt at an orderly treatise , but rather the more attractive manner of one who , well informed , might be asked to set down en caitserie his own impressions and those of his neighbors intimate with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	through many years .

		Believing that an adequate biography of Lincoln has yet to be written , Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	, like Mr.
Richards	PERSON	, embodies in his own volume some material that will have to be taken into account by whoever achieves a definitive `` Life '' of the great emancipator .

		Toward the elimination of much that is futile , and the finding of a correct point of view from which to work out a more authentic interpretation of his mind as well as his deeds , these two books will be invaluable aids .

		Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	strongly corroborates the gen - eral impression of
Herndon	ORGANIZATION	's defects as a biographer of Lincoln .

		Many others have felt his incompetency `` to reflect adequately .

		.

		the history of so great a life . ''

		The fabled insanity of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, for a time , over the death of
Ann Rutledge	PERSON	and the traditional fiction of uncongeniality between
Lincoln	PERSON	and his wife , become the mere apparitions of tale - bearers , who found it easier to judge d'apres les apparences than avec verite .

		The mutual sympathy and helpfulness of husband and wife , as portrayed by this octogenarian , pre - pares the reader , far better than some of the older biographers have done , to believe that `` without
Mary Todd	PERSON	for his wife ,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	would never have been President .

		Without
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	for her husband ,
Mary Todd	PERSON	would , probably , never have been a President 's wife . ''

		The chastening of old tales , springing in part from provincial surroundings , forms but an incidental merit of these reminiscences .

		An account of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's law-partnerships throws many interesting sidelights upon his char - acter and methods of work , and supplements the impressions derived from Mr.
Richards	PERSON	's study .

		Even after
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's immersion in Republican politics made close attention to law practice impossible , his seniority in the office called for his presence at the trial of the most important cases , the details of which were prepared by the office force .

		Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	writes : It was wonderful to us young men how quickly the chief grasped everything in the cases thus prepared and presented for his consideration .

		Such summaries of evidence and decisions pertinent to these cases were usually brought to his attention just before the trial , in night meetings at the office .

		His days were full of other affairs .

		His capacity and power for intense mental concentration at such conferences enabled him to master , in a very brief time , the important points involved in the suits into which he was called by Mr.
Herndon	PERSON	.

		So thorough was this mastery that he took the principal part in conducting these cases , whether the trial was before juries or the judge .

		Some of the most important cases in which he ever appeared were tried during these last two years of his active legal practice .

		As Mr.
Richards	PERSON	enrolls
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	`` among the foremost orators of any age , '' so also Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	would place him among the noblest .

		He heard the
Farewell Address	ORGANIZATION	at
Springfield	LOCATION	, and gives a version varying but slightly from those previously published .

		He would rank it with the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Speech .

		Lincoln 's habit was to revise all he had written , `` down to the latest hour possible before delivery . ''

		The 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE
Cooper Union Address	ORGANIZATION	`` grew very slowly .

		Herndon 's patience was sorely tried at times to see him loitering and cutting , as he thought , too laboriously ; but when the speech was completed , he admitted .

		.

		that it would be the crowning effort of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life up to that time . ''

		Any light upon
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's cultural reading has always been welcome , and Mr.
Rankin	PERSON	speaks authoritatively on this point .

		He shows that the law office of Lincoln and
Herndon	PERSON	was itself an intellectual centre , where many of the best books were read and discussed .

		Lincoln was a diligent reader in the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, which was rapidly growing .

		Another stimulus was
Newton Bateman	PERSON	,
State Super	ORGANIZATION	- intendent of Public Instruction , whose office , with its continual supply of new books , ad - joined
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's and these two remarkable men spent many hours together in intel - lectual camaraderie .

		Lincoln leaned toward poetry , and read
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Whitman	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He read , also ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, the elder
Abbott	PERSON	, and the addresses of
Beecher	PERSON	and
Theodore Parker	PERSON	.

		One of the latter 's political sermons was read aloud by
Herndon	PERSON	in the office , in
1857	DATE	, to which Lincoln `` listened attentively , discus - sing the political and rhetorical peculiarities of it with
Herndon	PERSON	and the two young men then present . ''

		This discourse contained the words to which Lincoln gave literary immor - tality in the closing phrases of the
Gettysburg Address	ORGANIZATION	six years afterward .

		The nature of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's reading in con - temporary politics is also clearly presented ; and it so happened that out of his connection with politics came the occasion of the clearest and apparently the most authentic statement of his religious convictions .

		This was during the heated campaign of
1856	DATE	, when Lincoln defeated the famous Methodist preacher ,
PeteP Cartwright	PERSON	, for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lincoln 's political foes circulated a charge of religious infidelity against him .

		It is due to the mem - ory of
Cartwright	PERSON	that , in
1862	DATE	, he publicly disavowed the truth of the accusation .

		Mr.
Herndon	PERSON	, however , in a lecture on Lincoln at
Springfield	LOCATION	, in
1874	DATE	, reasserted his law part - ner 's anti-Christian views .

		Mr.
Bankin	PERSON	is able to reproduce his mother 's account of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's own statement of his religious views , which he gave to her while a guest in her home during the congressional race in which his opponents were seeking to discredit him .

		Declaring that his own thinking , as well as contact with men of `` widest culture , '' had opened up to him a `` sea of questionings , '' through which he had groped his way to `` a higher grasp of thought '' reaching beyond this life with `` clearness and satisfaction , '' he continued : I do not see that I am more astray though per - haps in a different direction than many others whose points of view differ widely from each other in the sectarian denominations .

		They all claim to be Christians , and interpret their several creeds as infallible ones .

		Yet they differ and discuss these questionable subjects without settling them with any mutual satisfaction among themselves .

		I doubt the possibility , or propriety , of settling the religion of Jesus Christ in the models of man-made creeds and dogmas .

		It was a spirit in the life that He laid stress on and taught , if I read aright .

		I know I see it to be so with me .

		The fundamental truths reported in the four gos - pels as from the lips of Jesus Christ , and that I first heard from the lips of my mother , are settled and fixed moral precepts with me .

		I have concluded to dismiss from my mind the debatable wrangles that once perplexed me with distractions that stirred up , but never absolutely settled anything .

		I have tossed them aside with the doubtful differences which divide denominations , sweeping them all out of my mind among the non-essentials .

		I have ceased to follow such discussions or to be interested in them .

		I can not without mental reservations assent to long and complicated creeds and catechisms .

		If the church would ask simply for assent to the Savior 's statement of the substance of the law : `` Thou shalt love the Lord God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and thy neighbor as thyself , '' that church would I gladly unite with .

		General
William E. Doster	PERSON	's volume on `` Lincoln , and Episodes of the Civil War '' records many interesting experiences and observations of the author during his incum - bency of the office of Provost Marshal of
Washington	LOCATION	, from 1862-1863 .

		The first forty pages contain an address on Lincoln delivered by General
Doster	PERSON	before the students and faculty of
Lehigh University	ORGANIZATION	in
1909	DATE	.

		This address , filled with personal recollections of the years immediately before and during the war , is interesting reading , and is worthy of the permanent form it has been given in this volume .

		The more historical chapters describe the feverish conditions prevailing in Wash - ington during the first year of preparations for putting down the rebellion .

		They describe also the Old Capitol and
Carrol	PERSON	prisons for the detention of various sorts of prisoners .

		An intimate picture of
Stanton	PERSON	and his administration of the War Office adds to our knowledge of his personality ; and a chapter on `` The Capital in
1864	DATE	'' contains a diary of the author 's comments on the resig - nation of Secretary Chase , as well as observa - tions about
Fessenden	PERSON	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, and other per - sons and events of contemporary moment .

		The final chapter gives the author 's personal record and commentary on the trial of the conspirators implicated in the assassination of President
Lincoln	PERSON	, for two of whom Gen - eral
Doster	PERSON	acted as counsel .

		This chapter is a document of historical value ; albeit such an
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 311 expose of the military adjudication of these prisoners ' fate , including the probability of Mrs.
Surratt	PERSON	's innocence , becomes less con - genial reading with the lapse of years .

		Lord Charnwood 's Yolume-oiLjjiincoln , con - tributed to the `` Makers of the Nineteenth Century '' series , / is the first well-considered attempt of an Englishman to exhibit
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's personality and place in American statesman - ship .

		Although written primarily for British readers , the book will be highly interesting to Americans for its well studied point of view .

		It is the most successful portrait of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, in a single volume , drawn upon a clearly con - ceived background of political evolution , that has so far appeared / The author 's admirable condensation of our political history , from the adoption of the Constitution to the close of the Civil War , is heightened in interest by his sparkling cameo descriptions of certain of the most notable men who have influenced our national development .


Jefferson	PERSON	, `` scholar , musician , and mathematician , without deli - cacy , elevation , or precision of thought or language , '' was the author of `` not a - very candid State paper , '' about which grew up `` sentiments not wholly free from humbug '' ; yet he was a man who '' contributed that which was most needed for the evolution of a vig - orous national life . ''


Hamilton	PERSON	was `` in all senses a great man . ''


Calhoun	PERSON	, powerful of intellect , delighted in `` elaborate deductions ... which he was too proud to revise . ''


Andrew Jackson	PERSON	was a `` sincere Puritan '' whose `` ferocious '' and `` shocking character is refreshing to the student of the period . ''

		Lincoln 's is naturally the figure in leading relief , yet it is treated with such restraint that he is seen more as the product of our expand - ing nationalism than as a creature of special dispensation or of political fortuity .

		As one would expect from this point of view , the book is comparatively free from those provin - cial sidelights made traditional by trite biographers .

		Here the subject is raised to the dignity of historic conception and treated with the detachment befitting a sober sense of perspective .

		Lincoln is shown as responsive to the strength as well as the weaknesses of his environment , a man with no `` frigid per - fections , '' but possessed of greatness in patience and having `` some unexampled qual - ity of heart and mind '' which he gave to whatever he did .

		Lord Charnwood makes no attempt to define or estimate Lincoln 's great - ness .

		He feels that it is sufficient to appre - ciate the circumstances under which he lived and worked .

		He ascribes to
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's depth of thought the beauty of his classic utterances .

		He feels that as a statesman Lincoln had no theory in either his words or his acts ; that if he had any theory of democracy , it consisted in his hostility to the mastery of one man over another .

		This volume contributes nothing new to our information about its subject , but it succeeds admirably in its author 's obvious purpose to set forth a succinct and luminous impression of a great personality as it unfolded under the stress of an untoward environment in both private and public experience .

		GASPARD THE GREAT .

		* From the new literature of war the captains and the kings depart , and the common soldier reigns in their stead .

		Such is the spirit underlying the first epic story of the cataclysm
Rene Benjamin	PERSON	's `` Gaspard , '' a masterpiece which has obtained the prize of the
Goncourt Academy	ORGANIZATION	as the most original book of the year .

		Picturing the side-scenes of combat rather more than the lurid front , the author combines pathos with the princi - ples of a thorough realism .

		He is grave and temperate toward the enemy when speaking in his own person ; and he fortifies this objectivity by cleaving mainly to the stand - point of the poilu .

		The individual
Gaspard	ORGANIZATION	is detached against the mass of which he forms a unit .

		He and no monarch is now the central figure in the heroic tapestry .

		A regiment composed half of provincials , half of Parisians , is forming in a little
Norman	PERSON	town .

		The Parisians detrain , among them
Gaspard	PERSON	.

		That impudent denizen of the
Rue de la Gaite	ORGANIZATION	, `` Pantruche , '' mocks at the lordly station-master and goes roaming through the village , restless , blagueur , boast - ful , with his emotional nose in the air .

		This nose has an inquisitive twist to one side ; it is a feature full of character , like the nose of Cyrano .

		Entrusted , unconventionally , with handing out chance-fitting uniforms to his comrades , and later with equally amateur cooking for the regiment , Gaspard the Great somehow succeeds with both .

		He is capable of any - thing , he slangs and over-rides everybody with his clamorous personality ; ironic before the unknown , whether
Kaiser	PERSON	or loafer , trustful with his `` pals , '' who are successively a journalist , an interne , and a professor .

		.

		And these `` high-brows '' all love
Gaspard	PERSON	, the uneducated child of the people .

		312 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	The massed regiment , monotonous , imper - sonal , temporarily sinking self in the greatest common idea , now departs .

		Once on the cattle-train ,
Gaspard	PERSON	can not keep still .

		He and his companions overflow the compart - ments , drop off at the least provocation , and snap up any unconsidered trifle , such as a barrel of beer .

		They arrive by night in
Lorraine	LOCATION	, a mysterious country of strange winds , under dim stars .

		The frontier is beneath their feet .

		Gaspard declares they will be in
Berlin	LOCATION	tomorrow , he is also positive that a hundred thousand of the enemy fell before
Liege	LOCATION	, and that the German shells do not explode .

		He forages and cooks under the direction of the scrupulous captain .

		He dances with delight at the prospect of battle .

		`` Now we can scrap without minding the cops ! ''

		But there are long marches rain dead weariness .

		The signs of war are seen and heard : refugees and famished retreating regiments , the first mutter of cannon , and always dead weariness .

		Again the grumbling men are appeased by the prospect of a soup .

		Like comforted chil - dren , they gather eagerly around the pot and the captain orders them to upset it !

		Gaspard , stunned , obeys .

		The first shiver of battle is upon them .

		Shells are bursting around , for , after all , they do explode .

		`` Do they take us for tenpins ? ''

		howls
Gaspard	PERSON	, who refuses to be serious when his best friend talks of death .

		But when that `` pal '' is hit ,
Gaspard	PERSON	, himself badly wounded , painfully carries him to safety and the ambulance .

		And only then does he break down and weep for all the miseries of war .

		There follow two fantastic scenes .

		The wounded lie all night on the stones of a pro- vincial church .

		The moonlight floods in mournfully , shining on a broken figure of Christ , on
Gaspard	PERSON	and another soldier who group themselves , like the two thieves , around that figure .

		A stranger picture still is that of the
midnight	TIME	chase of the wailing mad - woman which
Gaspard	PERSON	, lame but subtle , leaves the hospital train to undertake .

		Then , passing through
Touraine	PERSON	, the beauty of life comes gently back to the wounded in their cattle-train of torments .

		The flowers and daughters , the fruit and laughter of sweet Touraine are as balm to the bruises of Gaspard .

		In the hospital , comic and grateful , he is the pet of the nurses , and the figures of these three nurses stand out as the three consoling graces of
France	LOCATION	militant .

		The hospital wards continue the mixed tumultuous pattern of life .

		A dying sergeant , trying to struggle through the
night	TIME	, longs for the crow of the cock to show that his vigil is over .

		It is near dawn , they tell him , and still the cock will not crow .

		Gaspard crawls out of bed , out of doors , imitates the call of Chantecler , and the sergeant dies in peace .

		But by this service
Gaspard	PERSON	reopens his wound and suffers anew .

		It is this mingling of comic and tragic , the revival of Hugo 's old `` theory of the gro - tesque , '' that gives the book its authentic appeal .

		You feel that it is so , that
Gaspard	PERSON	lived that way , that the war offers these contrasts .

		Gaspard continues to live that way after he gets back to the front where in a a few short hours he loses his leg .

		Then , characteristically enough , he becomes not a piteous cripple , but a cocky over-gallant cafe hero , trying the patience of his new-made wife .

		He goes gloriously back to `` Pantruche , '' and we leave him , with uplifted nose , coming to a private understanding with the dome of the Invalides .

		Throughout , the heroism of the soldier is larded with eccentricities .

		Between battles he returns to his beloved Rue de la Gaite , in order loyally to marry and `` legitimize his brat . ''

		But he steals two extra days beyond his furlough , and gets into abundant hot water ; his perplexed captain bundles him hastily off to the trenches , to avoid the angry civil authorities .

		If Gaspard piously carries home the news of a comrade 's death , he wilfully rearranges the facts to suit the hearers .

		In the midst of service , he flies into a passion ; he is saucily obedient , foul - mouthed and sublime .

		He has the most endearing faults , the most poignant laughter .

		He is one among many .

		But the many are now one , and this one is always himself .

		At the same time , he is the spirit of new
France	LOCATION	, manifest in the humblest of her children .

		`` Bayard is in the saddle again '' and
Bayard	PERSON	is now a democrat .

		An illiterate mischievous ~ bon dicible ,
Gaspard the Great	ORGANIZATION	unites the soul of Cyrano with the gestures of Tartarin .

		He revels in slang , in swagger and myths , and he revolts against machine-discipline and ignores tickets and labels .

		But
Gaspard	PERSON	also represents his kind in his gallant humorous acceptance of his lot , in his devotion to the light as he sees it .

		And the blood and iron of this little epic are compounded in the daring fortitude of a race that can intelli - gently receive an idea and staunchly live and die for it .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 313 RECEXT FICTIOX * A famous English man of letters thinking of `` subjects '' for fiction spoke long ago of the `` human and social suggestiveness '' of `` an old English country-house , round which experi - ence seems piled so thick . ''

		He was but an American story - writer at the time , and it may be that there was in his particular thought something of the passionate -LRB- if provincial -RRB- sentiment of his own pilgrim to such a lovely shrine .

		Yet many Englishmen must have had much of the same feeling , for there have been in the
past fifty years hundreds	DATE	of novels that did little else than present the life of an English country family .

		THE DIAL has of late spoken of three ,
Miss Mordaunt	PERSON	's `` The Family , '' Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's `` Watermeads , '' and Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's `` These Lynnekers , '' in which those acute observers had seen in the life of the country family signs of the times that suggested things interesting to the fiction writer , for , after all , these country families have given
England	LOCATION	most of her great men .

		One sees the sterner side in
Lucas Malet	PERSON	's `` Damaris . ''

		`` Damaris '' is not the story of an English country-house or anything of the sort ; it is a story of the English in
India	LOCATION	.

		But
Charles Verity	PERSON	, living as `` Commissioner-Sahib '' in the Sultan-i-hagh , at
Bhutpur	LOCATION	, was of an old family `` whose beautiful place ,
Canton Magna	LOCATION	, j lies in a fold of the chalk hills looking toward the Sussex border , '' and even when absorbed in Indian administration he looks back at times to `` Deadham Hard , the rambling patch - work of a house '' where he spent his holidays as a schoolboy .

		Doubtless the other English people at
Bhutpur	LOCATION	, from the old Judge and the old General down to the young secretaries , had much the same sort of recollections , j These English have gone out of their country - houses to rule the earth .

		There is something in the country-house life beside the gaiety and charm as well as the meaninglessness and futility that one understands at once .


Henrietta Pereira	PERSON	is an Englishwoman in spite of the Portugese name of her husband , an Englishwoman of good country family .

		But she is incurably light , charming , beautiful , full of schemes and j desires , bent on gratifying her fancies and I whims .

		The power of the book lies in its showing how such a woman looked beneath * DAMARIS .

		One feels the power of what she felt .

		But however we may be interested in see - ing in Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's novel an indication of the national vigor of the English in
India	LOCATION	as elsewhere , she herself had little of such a notion in mind , or more accurately she was thinking chiefly of something else .

		Titles do not of necessity show chief motives , but though a reader may at first be most impressed by this iron-handed English pro- consul and this wanton English lady , we may easily suppose that to Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	the chief interest lay in neither , but rather in the little five-year-old girl who gives its name to the book .

		A quaint and pathetic little person she is , and indeed must have been from the beginning .

		She was early left motherless , but as though that were not enough , the years of her childhood were passed in the atmos - phere , so extraordinary to us , of a great house in
India	LOCATION	, a house which seemed to carry into its use by the dominant race something which had come to it by centuries of Oriental life .

		If an English country-house has a human and social suggestiveness , if experience be piled thick around it , what will one say of the sum - mer palace of a native prince ?

		And what will be the result of this suggestiveness in the character of a little girl ?

		That is something that comes out in the book over and over again , the influence of the spirit of the Sultan-i-hagh not only on Damaris but on others within the ancient walls .

summer	DATE	palace -RRB- , `` They brought her very close to Nature ; to the silent life of the innumerable garden birds and gro - tesque or charming little garden animals .

		Dim , wistful intuition stirred in her , more - over , of the eternal mysteries of Birth and Death , '' and more beside .

		All that is very well done indeed .

		Nor is it in the main so unlike the thing we were speaking of .


Henrietta Pereira	PERSON	comes very `` close to Nature , '' too , in some of her moments with
Colonel Verity	ORGANIZATION	.

		She finds out that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, even in people born and brought up in Eng - lish country-houses , is often very different from the external crust formed even by cen - turies of easy , graceful , amusing existence .

		The true nature of anyone comes out in moments of stirring passion , of war , or of anything else .

		Another book about the English in this time of war is Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	's `` The Wonderful Year . ''

		I confess that I can not ever take Mr.
Locke	PERSON	very seri - ously ; I think of him as a sort of modified
Ouida	PERSON	.

		He is , of course , more modern than
Ouida	PERSON	, which makes one read him more unsus - 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	piciously , but he is not so original as she was nor so true to life .

		I presume , however , that those who think Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's books are won - derful novels by a wonderful author -LRB- among whom would seem to be included his pub - lishers -RRB- are not much exercised in these direc - tions .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	always has a certain sort of amusing originality in his conceptions , of his principal characters at least .

		This time he varies the personnel of his charming
Bohemia	LOCATION	of student quarter and old French inn by a whimsical personage whose occupation is the beneficent one of providing happiness for those who wish it .

		More crudely , he advises those who are `` up against it '' in their strug - gles with the world , always charging five francs as a fee for services that are often worth thousands .

		But Mr.
Locke	PERSON	has such a passion for the lovely , exquisite , charming , and also easy going that he never can get to the bottom of any serious problem , and so he does not give us anything really fundamental on the theory of happiness .

		Mr.
Daniel Fortinbras	PERSON	,
Marchand de Bonheur	ORGANIZATION	, in the two principal cases in question , advises his clients to capitalize their possessions and have a good time .

		This he does that they may find food for their souls .

		Martin and
Corinna	PERSON	, sent by Fortinbras on a bicycle trip to Brautome designed at first to exhaust their finances , do find food for their souls , find , indeed , happi - ness by following this apparently eccentric advice .

		It is not clear , however , that we can draw a general lesson from their case .

		Per - haps that is natural ; a man who lives by giving advice will hardly put his advice in a form in which it will be as useful to humanity as to his especial clients .

		Otherwise we should be inclined to compare the counsel of M. Fortinbras with that of another great
Marchand	PERSON	de Bonheur who also said , `` Take no thought for the morrow . ''

		The chief dif - ference that a casual study shows between the two is that the earlier teacher advised people to sell what they had and give to the poor , while the more recent adviser advised these people , at least , to spend what they had in having a good time and thereby feeding their souls .

		Some readers will think it mighty lucky for them that the war came along and gave them something to be really serious about .

		The war was useful to Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's young couple in that it recalled them from light ideals to matters of more permanent importance .

		It is not screwing around these things into perverted shapes that we are doing when we interpret specimens of current fiction in the fearful and lurid light of the present war .

		It is always possible to abstract oneself , for the time at least , from current trials and read or write books that seem as clear and free from contemporary disturbance as the remote mountain brook seems to the city-dweller .

		But we in
America	LOCATION	are -LRB- most of us -RRB- so vitally interested in
England	LOCATION	's doings in this war that we can not long think of English men and women without some influence of that tremendous disturbance of old customs and old manners of life and thought .

		It comes up as we read all sorts of things .

		And just at the moment there is a book in which the author has addressed himself directly to the matter which so often colors our thoughts indirectly .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has published his view of the English mind as affected by the war under the name `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through . ''

		I usually read Mr.
Wells	PERSON	with such an exhilarated intensity that I never have much critical opinion on what I have read .

		When I am not reading him , it is true , I can see that he is not a great novelist in the sense that
Henry James	PERSON	is , or Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		His books sometimes have and sometimes have not the things that I commonly think necessary for good novels .

		Perhaps he ought to be called a publicist as he calls Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and others .

		He seems to regard Mr.
Britling	PERSON	as a publicist , and I presume that Mr.
Britling	PERSON	in general position must have been very like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself .

		A pub - licist is not a bad kind of person to be , now that the older diplomatic meaning has been superseded by more popular use .

		If a pub - licist is a person who publishes his thoughts on public affairs , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is one , and `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through '' is an excellent piece of work .

		If one must criticise it as a novel there will , in some minds at least , be difficulties .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	was a distinguished man of letters living at Matching 's Easy , a pleasant Old English sort of place in
Essex	LOCATION	.

		The book tells how the war affected him .

		So much any publicist could have done , who was inter - ested in giving an account of the mind of
England	LOCATION	during the past two years .

		What Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does in his non-publicist capacity is to put these matters , which easily grow gen - eral and abstract , into terms of actual life .

		And that must be one of the necessary gifts of the novelist , to imagine things in terms of people ; at any rate , that is what Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does .

		He gives us a realizing idea of the com - fortable easy-going country life -LRB- with its vigorous and extraordinary game of hockey -RRB- ; of the way people thought and talked , of the confident and vague divagations about Ulster , the tentative reflections about Kitchenerism
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 315 and efficiency and being fit , of the facile and futile information about
Sarajevo	LOCATION	and
Bosnia	LOCATION	and assassination as a political .

		method , of the disquisitions concerning
England	LOCATION	's foreign policy , of Aunt
Wiltshire	LOCATION	's winning twenty - five cocoanuts by throwing sticks at them at the Flower Show at the time the Germans were entering
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Then he goes on through the two years of the war , limiting matters to Mr.
Britling	PERSON	, only I suppose , because it would make too big a book to pre - sent all sorts and conditions of English thought and feeling .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	is a very real sort of person .

		It may seem wonderful that he should be entangled in a wrong and foolish love-affair , that he should be intensely absorbed in learn - ing to drive a motor car , that he should be troubled about the future of his son , that he should think longingly now and then of finish - ing that great beautiful thing of his called `` The Silent Places '' ; wonderful in a novel about the war , but natural , necessary , and quite right and interesting , too .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's ideas change .

		First he conceives the idea that the war was brought about and carried on by a Prussian war-party ; then he speculates as to the
End of War and a Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the nations at
Delhi	LOCATION	or
Samarkand	LOCATION	or some - where else ; then he begins gradually to understand what
England	LOCATION	is up against , and sees that the nation must do something beside sympathize with the army and read the papers ; then he appreciates that everyone must get to work , that sons and lovers must go into the army , his son among others .

		One can not work through the whole book , nor would it be worth while .

		I do n't discuss Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's account ; I can not but take it as history .

		Such a course of things occurred in one mind at least ; these things , or others like them , one has seen a hundred times else - where .

		Such a book is a great feat of the imagination ; not conclusive , of course , but showing a way of thinking and feeling , a way much broader and more refined and more complex than the ordinary country-house feel - ing about the war , such as the people at Watermeads would have had , or such as the people in `` The Wonderful Year '' did have .

		At bottom , probably , there is just the same thing .

		In all the hatred of the war , the anguish , the loathing , the weariness , even in the reluctances and backslidings , there must be , not only to
Hugh Britling	PERSON	or
Cecily Corners	PERSON	, the satisfaction of what has long been a desire , the desire , in all these years of ease and happiness and luxury , for something real to happen , a real happening being , as
Cecily	PERSON	said , that one does something , some - thing beside playing hockey and having tea .

		That is a good thing for us in
America	LOCATION	to think of as well as for people in
England	LOCATION	to experience .

		W r hether it be in war or in politics or in education or in business or in religion , it is a fine thing to be able to do something real , and if one gets aroused to that notion by reading novels , the thing is worth more than it sometimes seems .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Correspondence In the daVS f the GeorgCS , they of a Georgian made a serious business of letter - writing .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that the carefully culled selection from
Earl Granville	PERSON	's private correspondence -LRB- Button , 2 vols. ,
$ 10	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, edited by his daughter - in-law ,
Countess Granville	PERSON	, should occupy two large volumes , of from five to six hundred pages each .

		But however voluminous , this cor - respondence possesses marked historical , so - cial , and personal interest .

		By far the larger proportion of the letters are from the Count - ess of Bessborough to Lord
Granville	PERSON	.

		Between these two , from the time of their first meeting in
1794	DATE	to the
Countess	ORGANIZATION	's death in
1821	DATE	, there existed a loyal friendship , which , on her part at least , touched an ideally beautiful plane .

		Her letters reveal a woman of mind and heart , with a wider and more sympathetic outlook upon life than was usual in the society in which she moved , a society which has been described as presenting a strange combination of dissipation and intellectual refinement .

		A wonderfully vivid picture of the social life of the time is given in her letters , with lively descriptions of the noted people she was con - stantly meeting ; and , there are interesting side-lights upon the political complexities which then harassed
England	LOCATION	.

		Her letters from
Paris	LOCATION	, first under the Napoleonic regime and later after the Restoration , are especially entertaining .

		Lady Bessborough 's letters , a number from
Earl Granville	PERSON	's mother ,
Lady Stafford	PERSON	, and a few from
Pitt	PERSON	,
Canning	ORGANIZATION	, and others , have been selected and arranged with a view to throwing light upon the career and character of
Earl Granville	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , there are very few of his own letters , those to Lady Bessborough having been almost all destroyed by him , so that one is obliged to construct the portrait of the protagonist from the hints , allusions , and encomiums of his friends .

		From the few letters of his that are included one would hardly gather that he was so extremely gifted or so superlatively fas - cinating as his friends assuredly regarded 316 THE DIAL him ; for not only do Lady Bessborough and Lady
Stafford	PERSON	constantly bear witness to his diplomatic and social successes , but the few letters from
Pitt	PERSON	and Canning show in what high estimation he was held by these brilliant lights .

		Lady Bessborough , perhaps , allowed the enthusiasm of her admiration to go almost too far at times , but , as she often says of herself , she never could love anything by halves .

		Only second in interest to
Lady Bessborough	LOCATION	's letters are those of
Granville	PERSON	's mother ,
Lady Stafford	LOCATION	.

		Though she was not so brilliant as her son 's friend , a remark - able sweetness of nature is revealed in her letters .

		She adored her husband and loved her son .

		It is to be remarked to Lord
Granville	PERSON	's credit that he seems uniformly to have taken in good part the criticisms of himself by his mother and his friend , and on the whole he must have profited by their advice , as is witnessed by his successful dip - lomatic career , and his final most happy mar - riage to the niece of Lady Bessborough , Lady
Harriet Cavendish	PERSON	.

		Much might be said of the historical interest of this correspondence ; but , after all , its chief value probably lies in its intimate picture not of Lord
Granville	PERSON	but of the unusual personality of Lady Bessbor - ough , who joined to her keen interest in political and social affairs , and her friendly enthusiasms , an intellectual appreciation of the best in art and literature .

		Her literary judgments upon the many books she was con - stantly reading have a piquant originality quite refreshing .

		The two volumes are adorned by many finely reproduced portraits of unusually handsome people .

		General interest in the testing of intelligence , especially in the terms of age development , has now received recognition in a volume survey - ing the field , and also introducing a critical conception of method and application .

		`` The Measurement of Intelligence '' -LRB-
Houghton Miff	ORGANIZATION	- lin -RRB- , by Professor
Lewis M. Terman	PERSON	, of
Stan	PERSON	-
ford University	ORGANIZATION	, serves as an admirable hand - book to the subject .

		The Binet tests began with the attempt to furnish age-norms for chil - dren from three years to twelve .

		The fact that almost all tests imply a special ability of one kind or another led to the introduction of the point-scale , in which relative failure in one test might be balanced by accomplishment in another .

		Going beyond this , the Stanford system uses the conception of an intelligence - quotient , which expresses the place of the individual tested in terms of the average abil - ity of his class .

		The last has the distinct advantage that age-norms can be calculated from it , while it yet allows for alternate tests and the adjustment of test to special circum - stances .

		The theory of the test is set forth , the data are reported , the detailed practical instructions are given , and the whole is arranged for the year-by-year advance .

		The volume thus furnishes a complete handbook for the practitioner , as well as a basis of com - prehension for the student .

		It is well con - ceived and admirably executed .

		There is the danger that the tests will become too mechan - ical , and their application obscure the issue for the method ; the only way to avoid this is by adequate training of those who make the tests .

		As to the scope of the tests , they have proved their ability to reveal more of the nature of individual capacity in a few hours than any other estimate , such as that of school work or general judgment .

		Naturally they leave untested many of the qualities which the social and industrial world cherishes ; but within their legitimate province , the tests form precisely the kind of additional guage which the school and the industrial employer require for their protection .

		The elimination of the unfit and the determination of normal - ity , especially in connection with proceedings in Juvenile Courts , adds to the interest attach - ing to an important phase of applied psychol - ogy .

		studies of European war has for two china and the years so absorbed our interest se people .

		that lesg than the ugual atten _ tion has been given to the Orient .

		Yet there is ample reason for bestowing upon the Orient at this time more thoughtful consideration than at any period of the past .

		For a con - flict greater than the present tremendous struggle among the branches of the white race threatens to array the white against the colored races of mankind , unless some means can be found for reconciling the conflicting interests of those peoples .

		Moreover , events are moving rapidly , and such a means of allay - ing hostility must be discovered without undue delay .

		First of all , the spread of cor - rect information among us concerning the Asiatics is greatly to be desired , in order that race prejudice , the mother of hostility and war , may be dispelled .

		Special attention should therefore be given to those dealing with
Asia	LOCATION	, and particularly to books dealing with the profounder aspects of the problem of the Asiatic peoples .

		Two such books recently from the press are to be highly com - mended , Mr.
G. L. Harding	PERSON	's `` The Present - Day China '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , and Dr.
J. W. Bashford	PERSON	's ``
China	LOCATION	: An Interpretation ''
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 317 -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume first mentioned i gives the impressions formed by an unusually j capable , observant , and sympathetic corre - I spondent during a prolonged stay in
China	LOCATION	, i covering especially the period of the establish - ment of the Republic , and his estimate of the | significance of more recent events .

		Like so j many other open-minded observers , Mr.
Harding	PERSON	holds the Chinese people in high i regard , and treats their struggle for consti - | tutional government with the utmost serious - j ness , as one of the outstanding events in j history .

		His observations give evidence not only of breadth of interest and responsiveness | to human events , but also of unusually full and accurate information .

		The book is of much greater value than its small compass would seem to indicate .

		``
China	LOCATION	: An Inter - pretation , '' by a Bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, resident for many years in
China	LOCATION	, is a very satisfactory ` companion volume .

		That two writers so unlike , one a correspondent and traveller , the other a mis - sionary and old resident , should so closely resemble each other in their attitude of friendliness and respect toward the Chinese , and optimism with regard to the potentialities of the race , gives added weight to that view of the situation in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		For a fairly comprehensive treatment of the whole subject of
China	LOCATION	, containing information gleaned from many authoritative sources and from wide travel and intimate intercourse with the Chinese people , Dr.
Bashford	PERSON	's book will bear comparison with any volume with which the present reviewer is familiar .

		Not only does it commend itself as a general introduction to the whole field , but it presents also well reasoned consideration of some of the most pressing problems growing out of the rela - tions of
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Presidential nominations and elections .

		The most interesting perhaps the most important develop - ment in American political his - tory has been the extra-constitutional growth of parties ; but the story of this development is to some extent neglected by political histo - rians except so far as the actions taken by the parties have had a direct influence on the gov - ernment .

		Of particular value , therefore , in a year when the importance of the national political organizations is strikingly evident to everyone , is Mr.
Joseph Bucklin Bishop	PERSON	's `` Presidential Nominations and Elections : A History of
American Conventions	ORGANIZATION	,
National Campaigns	ORGANIZATION	, Inaugurations , and Campaign Caricature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		`` What the author has to say about the origin of conventions and caucuses is fairly well known ; in 1763
John Adams	PERSON	wrote of the `` caucus club '' which met in a garret , the members smoking `` tobacco till you can not see from one end of the room to the other , '' and regularly choosing the representatives `` before they were chosen in the town . ''

		The first national conventions , however , were held in
1830	DATE	and
1831	DATE	; the requirement of the Democrats that the nomi - nee must receive a two-thirds vote was invented by
Jackson	PERSON	in
1831	DATE	, for what reason Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	does not venture an opinion .

		The so-called `` unit rule '' abandoned by the Dem - ocrats in
1912	DATE	is of later origin .

		Many facts of similar nature with reference to the early conventions are of great interest , and fur - nish an introduction for what is the most readable portion of the volume that which deals with the defeated aspirations of
Webster	PERSON	, Clay , and
Blaine	PERSON	.

		One is likely to remember these men for their public achieve - ments rather than for their failure to get presidential nominations , and the story told by Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	is therefore valuable .

		Prac - tically all of the conventions are covered by the book , including the story of the `` steam - roller '' at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1912	DATE	* and the bolt of the Progressives .

		Very interesting chapters deal with the development of the inaugura - tion ceremony to its present scope , and with cartoons as moulders of public opinion the author thinks that their influence is `` incal - culable . ''

		Nearly fifty illustrations -LRB- many of them cartoons -RRB- add greatly to the value of the book .

		A near view of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	at
Saranac Lake	ORGANIZATION	is given by Mr.
Stephen Chalmers	PERSON	, one-time secretary to Dr.
Trudeau	PERSON	, in `` The Penny Piper of Saranac '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- , and a still more vivid picture of him as seen a little later at
Manasquan	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, by Mrs.
Wyatt Eaton	PERSON	, in `` A Last Memory of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The `` Penny Piper '' sketch is thought by its author to have exerted an influence `` that led to the Saranac Lake
Stevenson	PERSON	Memorial '' ; for it was first published four years ago in a pop - ular periodical , and it is only its present form that is new , with its brief preface by Lord
Guthrie	PERSON	and its introductory note by the author .

		Some of its passages will be found in substance , and occasionally in exact detail , in the same writer 's book , `` The Beloved Physician . ''

		It was in collaboration with this physician , Dr.
Edward Livingston Trudeau	PERSON	, that `` The Penny Piper '' was written .

		A pho - tograph of the
Stevenson	PERSON	memorial tablet is inserted as frontispiece .

		Mrs.
Eaton	PERSON	's remi - 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 19	DATE	niscent sketch portrays in even more lifelike detail the `` frail and distinguished-looking '' wizard of romance .

		Being a woman , as well as a fervid admirer of
Stevenson	PERSON	, she could observe more minutely the many little pecu - liarities , the nameless idiosyncrasies , that went to the making of the man .

		Incidentally she tells us which of his works he considered his best , and which his worst .

		They are , respectively , `` Will o ' the Mill '' and `` Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	. ''

		But who knows whether the tricksy
R. L. S.	PERSON	did not change his mind the next day and reverse his judg - ment ?

		To the now considerable mass of Stevensoniana these little books by two close observers of the man are welcome additions .

		The fine art Compact , scholarly , and useful of correct is the small manual on `` Good English in Good Form '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Dora Knowlton Ranous	PERSON	.

		Experienced in editing and trans - lating , and also a writer in her own name , she is or was , for she died two months before her book appeared well qualified to discuss the principles of good prose composi - tion .

		Counsels of perfection she necessarily gives us on every page , and he might be branded as a pedant who should observe all her rules .

		But there is no danger of any too scrupulous following of these directions .

		Her censure of the misuse of will and would , a misuse that she calls `` absolutely shocking , '' is none too strong , and is as sadly needed as it will be carelessly disregarded .

		Her plea for conciseness as well as accuracy in urging the omission of certain redundancies is also to be commended .

		Among `` words and phrases to be avoided '' she condemns `` averse from , '' whereas for etymological reasons it is pref - erable to `` averse to , '' though usage has familiarized us with the latter form .

		A chap - ter is given to punctuation , precept and exam - ple being well combined in the brief space assigned to the subject .

		Twelve is given as the number of punctuation marks , but what these twelve are is not clearly indicated .

		It would be hard to make up a round dozen with - out including the mark of quotation and other symbols not commonly regarded as punctua - tion marks .

		Rules for the preparation of manuscript for print are also added , with directions for proof-reading and the prepara - tion of illustrations .

		Much space is filled , perhaps rather ill-advisedly , with a list of words derived from the Latin and Greek .

		An index or a more detailed table of contents would have improved the book .

		But it is a good and useful and handy little volume as it stands .

		For a free
India	LOCATION	.

		Under the title , `` Young
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr. La j pat
Rai	PERSON	sets forth the plea of his party for Indian self-government .

		The author is a well educated lawyer , who had been an influential public man before his expatriation ; and he has given us a book that is distinctly above the average of this propagandist literature .

		All of the traditional arguments against British rule are skilfully propounded ; but , unfortunately , the old failure to face reali - ties is also in evidence .

		For instance , the author himself italicizes this summary of an important paragraph : `` Illiteracy the Fault of the British and No Bar to Self-Govern - ment . ''

		Obviously , the question of blame may be debatable ; but if illiteracy is no bar to self-government in
the twentieth century	DATE	, we must surely stop and recast a lot of funda - mental conceptions .

		Again , our author may not be responsible for the `` foreword '' by Mr.
J. T. Sutherland	PERSON	; but it is simply fatuous to state : `` The truth is , not one fact can be recited to show that
India	LOCATION	can not govern her - self well if given a chance . ''

		If the problem were as simple as that , it would not exist .

		We have not space to review the volume at length ; but the following four features should be noted : An account of Indian disaffection since the beginning of the war ; a description of the various types of `` nationalists '' ; a state - ment that Hindus and Mohammedans are now in hearty accord ; and , above all , the assertion that the movement for liberation has become a living force among the common people .

		If it were true that the two great religious bodies could now live side by side in peaceful har - mony , and that the villager , the ultimate atom of Indian humanity , has actually been aroused , then the great change would not be far off .

		But is it true ?

		To all thinking Amer - icans we can recommend the volume ; and unthinking Americans do not care about
India	LOCATION	anyway .

		inter-relations The volu T me on `` Movement and of thought Mental Imagery '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
Margaret Floy Washburn	PERSON	of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, forms one of a series commemorative of the
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	semi - centennial .

		It is a thoughtful and scholarly work , treating an important problem in a difficult field .

		The author brings to bear upon it the combined methods of experimental attack and delicate analysis .

		While the appeal of the book is distinctly to the tech - nical student of psychology , the wider bear - ings of the conception are well considered .

		The fundamental search is for the inner proc - esses that accompany , if indeed they do not
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 319 direct , the movement of thought ; and the emphasis is upon the movement system which finds its typical expression in action .

		Thought is suppressed action ; if the movement tenden - cies disappear , the thesis asserts that thought itself will vanish .

		Complete paralysis would be the extinction of thinking .

		The association of ideas is subjected to the same interpreta - tion , and is inextricably woven with the slight initial motor habits that support them .

		The abnormal field is included , and dissociation becomes an invasion of the motor processes through which the action takes place but is divorced from its normal report .

		We think in so far as we control muscles ; if our muscles were to become animated by impulses unre - lated to the normal habit , personality would become a myth .

		At every point the motor integrity is indispensable to intellectual unity .

		The book is largely devoted to the ramification of details which support or oppose one theory or another .

		This survey of the problem is a distinct aid to the psychological student .

		A handbook Notwithstanding the voluminous on the German aspect of the literature of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean politics , there is a dearth of brief and trustworthy treatises in English on the governmental systems of the principal countries .

		The need bids fair to be supplied , however , by a series of `` Government Hand - books , '' planned and edited by Professors
David P. Barrows	PERSON	and
Thomas H. Reed	PERSON	, of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		The initial vol - ume in this series ,
Fritz-Konrad Kriiger	PERSON	's `` Government and Politics of the German Empire '' -LRB-
World Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has recently appeared ; and it is agreeable to record that the standard of accuracy and readableness which it sets is high .

		The book was written before the outbreak of the present war , and the author asserts that neither the contents nor the opinions expressed have been affected by the events of the past two years .

		With the spirit of the work no one can find fault .

		After introductory historical chapters , the Imperial governmental system is described in all of its characteristic aspects , and there are included reasonably full resumes of the parliamentary history of the country , of foreign policy since
1871	DATE	, and of the government of dependencies .

		Treatment of all subjects is necessarily brief , but space is well apportioned , and in most of the chapters a surprising amount of informa - tion is packed into a few pages .

		A feature of value is the
Critical Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	; although it would be possible to dissent from the appraisal of certain titles .

		When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL 328 Abraham Lincoln By LORD CHARNWOOD From The
New York	LOCATION	Tribune : `` Peculiar interest invests this great English history of
Lincoln	LOCATION	; for Lord Charnwood 's masterly work is not a mere biography , but a history of Lincoln and of his era in American political life .

		`` He divines Lincoln , and the antecedents and the circumstances of his career , with exceptional sympathy and correctness .

		He shows throughout a scope of vision , a sense of proportion , a sanity of judgment , a facility in digesting and utilizing to advantage an almost immeasurable mass of material , and a style which charms by its clarity while it convinces by its cogency . ''

		From The
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	: `` Well conceived , sometimes brilliant in its interpretation , and animated by a high reverence for
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's greatness and goodness . ''

		From The Springfield Republican : '' The first serious attempt by an Englishman to give a complete picture of the great war president .

		The author , better known as
Godfrey Kathbone Benson	PERSON	, is an Oxford man , who has been a liberal member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and the holder of numerous public offices .

		From many points of view the life of a great national figure , when written by a foreigner with intense admiration for the man , but with a frankly critical mind , should give one a more Impartial picture than could be drawn , perhaps , by one 's own fellow-countrymen .

		In this Lord Charnwood has not disappointed us , for he looks at his subject in a different light from that of the average American of today .

		Moreover and this is not the least of Lord Charnwood 's advantages as a biographer of Lincoln he writes as an experienced politician , familiar with the questions of organization , conciliation and popular appeal which the politician is perpetually called upon to solve . ''

		`` Its qualities of information , judgment and style will probably win for it an enduring place in historical literature . ''

		360 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF
MAURICE HEWLETT	PERSON	.

		Glancing idly through the `` display '' col - umns of one of our literary journals the other day , my eye encountered an advertisement which involuntarily gave me pause .

		The major portion of it was taken up with the announcement of a new novel by
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	and , tucked away in a small corner beneath , was that of a new novel by
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	.

		I repeat , it gave me pause .

		For this reason that
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	is the author of `` Graustark '' and ``
Brewster	PERSON	's Millions , '' while
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is the author of `` The Forest Lovers '' and ``
Richard Yea-and-Nay	PERSON	. ''

		That is to say , the former is a purveyor of literary chaff and the latter is a literary creator .

		I do not know that
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	has ever contended that his books are literature .

		But I do know that divers of them have been so acclaimed by the most discriminating critics and readers ; while , on the contrary , Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	has given us his word for it , through the medium of a published interview which , so far as I am aware , has never been denied , that his books pretend to nothing above the status of the best-seller .

		What , then , is the implication of the adver - tisement ?

		Is it the old , old story of art in the market-place ?

		Perhaps but it is also some - thing more , something which involves other considerations and leads to other conclusions .

		As a matter of fact , not so many years ago the positions of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	and Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	would , in such circumstances , have been reversed .

		The former would have been the `` top-liner , '' and the latter would have occupied the left-over corner .

		At that time publishers fairly fought for the priv - ilege of printing
Hewlett	PERSON	.

		The fortunate one that landed him bought up the rights in his earlier works , and brought him out superbly in a limited edition de luxe , in style and form similar to that with which a grand maitre ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	, had but recently been hon - ored .

		August academic journals sung his praises , and Olympian critics belauded him .

		338 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	At the same time , idols of the lyric stage and editors of comic `` colyums '' in unison pro- claimed him their favorite author .

		Not only were his brows crowned with laurel , his pockets bulged with gold .

		He had achieved the impossible namely , the creation of masterpieces of literary art that were best - sellers also .

		His new book was the event of the season so far as fiction was concerned .

		Both Grub Street and Parnassus bowed before him .

		And now the difference !

		If outward and visible signs afford any criterion for correct judgment , the vogue of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is a thing of yester-year .

		His glory has departed .

		The publishers of the edition de luxe long since yielded him to a rival , and that rival to another , and his successive books show an increasing variety of imprints .

		His new novel of this
fall of 1916	DATE	creeps obscurely into publicity in the shadow of the exploitation of
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	whose vogue , apparently , grows ever greater .

		Personally , I do not read
McCutcheon	PERSON	, but those who do assure me that he writes better nowadays than he did in the days of `` Graustark . ''

		This , at best , is rather a negligible item ; but , alas , it is impossible to say of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	that he writes better than he did in the days of `` The Forest Lovers . ''

		On the contrary , he writes much less well .

		But , whatever and however he writes , the public no longer cares for him this being true not only of the Many-Headed , but of his own particular part thereof .

		The last
Hewlett	PERSON	book I read was `` The Song of Renny . ''

		It was a Tauchnitz edition , which in
Berlin	LOCATION	cost me but
forty cents	MONEY	, as against the dollar-fifty that the American edi - tion commanded .

		On that account I held it very caressingly in my hand ; but , all the same , I could never have finished it but for the fact that I was at the time in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	with nothing else to fall back upon .

		So I persevered to the end , which I reached in a condition of more or less exhaustion .

		Since then I have tried one more `` Bendish , '' on which I did not squander my money , prudently obtaining it from a lending library .

		As I was unable to get through even the first hundred pages , I con - gratulated myself upon my economic fore - sight .

		The other day I saw a big stack of books in a familiar binding exposed ignomin - iously upon the bargain-counter of a depart - ment store , abaft the soda-fountain and adjacent to the union-suits .

		I drew near and the premonition of my prophetic soul was verified .

		It was a `` remainder '' of a Hewlett romance that had come from the press originally one little year ago .

		But and this was still more cruel even at the price marked , a fraction of its pristine value , I had no use for it .

		The decline and fall of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is a topic to which our most learned literary doctors might profitably devote themselves , or so one would think .

		But none of them seems interested , and I , a mere sweeper-out of the temple and fagot-gatherer in the grove of the muses , perforce find myself committed thereto .

		`` Whom the gods love die young . ''

		The images arise of
Keats	PERSON	, of
Byron	LOCATION	, of
Shelley	LOCATION	, of
Chatterton	LOCATION	, but , in truth , did not Balzac die young at fifty-nine ?

		And will not
William de Morgan	PERSON	, if he lives to be a hun - dred ?

		In the case of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, how - ever , it is difficult not to believe that had he been so beloved of the gods as to have `` passed '' upon the morrow of the publication of `` Richard Yea-and-Nay '' he would have descended in literary history or , rather , in literature , that thing so ineffably greater in incontestable enjoyment of a magnificent fame , one which
Time	ORGANIZATION	could not lessen but would with an immortal finger seal forever .

		Beside that glorious volume , upon a small shelf , jealously sacred to a consecrated master , would repose `` Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' `` The Forest Lovers , '' `` Little Novels of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and `` New Canterbury Tales , '' together with those verses which include `` Pan and the
Young Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Songs and Meditations , '' and the `` Masque of Dead Florentines . ''

		Ten - derly the eye of the lover of literature would dwell upon that shelf , and beneath his breath he would say softly , '' Infinite riches in a little room ! ''

		As it is , I have these volumes not only , but many others , all blazoned with the name of
Hewlett	LOCATION	.

		They fill one long shelf , and over - flow upon another ; but I really care only for those few which , I fondly think , bear upon their pages the glowing impress of a genius unique and incomparable , to whom I owe enchanted hours and golden dreams .

		The others well , of a truth I should not like to part with `` The Road in
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' but per - haps more on account of
Pennell	ORGANIZATION	's pictures
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 339 than of
Hewlett	ORGANIZATION	's text .

		I should hate also to give up `` The Fool Errant , '' which is of a peculiar and complete delectability ; or divers of the conies , namely , that of Buondelmonte and that called `` The Ruinous Face . ''

		And there are passages in the Senhouse series that thrill and vibrate ; still , I could live without them .

		But the sacred half-dozen I do not think I could forego .

		`` What , then , is the dif - ference betwixt `` these '' and `` those '' ?

		What has led to the decline and fall ?

		It must , I think , resolve itself into the irresistible conclusion that a great literary artist can not live by style alone .

		It is true , to cite an instance , that according to a pop - ular superstition ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	does so ; but this is only a superstition , and obtains only among those who have never read him , or , having done so , are incapable of fathoming the depth of his thought or feeling the vital - ity of his matter .

		But the style of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, that style which led a critic once to write of it as `` something mysteriously beau - tiful , like a piece of ancient arras , '' has degen - erated into a mere galvanism , incapable of imparting to his later pages more than a factitious value .

		If his early ones were like to ancient arras , those of to-day resemble nothing else so much as mere wall-paper .

		There is something of the old gorgeous pat - tern , something of the old flaming and smould - ering hues , something of the old jewelled lustres ; but it is only an imitation , that worst of all imitations , a writer deliberately imitating himself .

		None of us can escape his destiny , and it is only fair to
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	to say that he perceived his own , and the dolor of it , and tried to escape .

		From the impasse which he beheld himself approaching , as an avenue to freedom he set his feet in the pathway that
George Meredith	PERSON	had marked out an unfortunate choice in that he failed to see that only
Meredith	PERSON	might walk therein .

		The result was `` The Stooping Lady '' and its con - geners , books which , I doubt not , brought him money but , in justice to his fame , were for the most part better unwritten .

		Now he appears to be gravitating aimlessly back and forth from one genre to another , and produces alternately such volumes as ``
Frey	PERSON	and his Wife '' and `` Love and Lucy , '' books which it is hardly more than necessary to glance through in order to recognize as mere futili - ties of virtuosity in vacuo .

		The moral ?

		If you must have one , it is the moral of overproduction , of the bastard litter procreated by the commercialization of art .


Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	was an artist , in his own metier a consummate one , truly un prosateur parfait , until from his altars he tore down their old divinities , and in their stead erected the graven image of the Great God Success .

LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's new book of essays , `` Cloud and Silver , '' there is an interesting chapter on `` Martin Boss '' and
E. CE	ORGANIZATION	.


Somerville	LOCATION	, the two ladies who wrote `` Some Experiences of an Irish R.M. , '' and other books .

		The former -LRB- Miss Violet Martin -RRB- recently died , so that the partnership will produce no more .

		It is certainly a loss to letters , few people here , and probably fewer in
America	LOCATION	, realize how considerable a loss .

		For these two ladies were not mere ordinary writers of Irish sketches .

		Their material has been used by scores of people ; but none of their predecessors in the field has written as well as they .

		They were not the usual cultured and intelligent ladies pro- ducing something readable and ephemeral for the vicarages of
England	LOCATION	.

		They were artists .

		Or rather they were an artist ; for nothing short of the word of two women of unimpeach - able veracity could have persuaded one that their books were the work of anything but a single hand .

		The characters are so clear and consistent ; the humor , the run of the sen - tences , the choice of unexpected yet absolutely Bright '' epithet , are so individual .

		I open a book at random -LRB- critics are always saying they ha \ e done this ; but this time it is not a falsehood -RRB- and I light at once on a para - graph which illustrates the flow of their style on its ordinary , not on its best , level :
Philippa	LOCATION	assured me she could not read it all .

		During the previous winter she had had five lessons and a half in the Irish language from the
National Schoolmaster	ORGANIZATION	, and believed herself to be one of the props of the Celtic movement .

		My own attitude with regard to the Celtic movement was sympathetic , but a brief inspection of the grammar convinced me that my sympathies would not survive the strain of trip - thongs , eclipsed consonants , and synthetic verbs , and that I should do well to refrain from embittering my declining years by an impotent and humiliating pur - suit of the most elusive of pronunciations .

		Philippa had attained to the height of being able to greet the schoolmaster in
Irish	LOCATION	, and , if the day happened to be fine , she was capable of stating the fact ; other aspects of the weather , however remarkable , she 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	epitomised in a brilliant smile , and the schoolmaster was generally considerate enough not to press the matter .

		There is no need to go to extremes and pre - tend that their books are more important then they are ; these two women have done a minor thing about as well as it can be done .

		Their comedies are as necessary to anyone who wants to get a good idea of
Ireland	LOCATION	as are the far more farcical and exaggerated studies of `` G. A.
Birmingham	LOCATION	. ''

		One is reminded again of the amount of good literature of all kinds that has come from
Ireland	LOCATION	in the last generation .

		Large and small , almost half our respectable authors in the period have come from
Ireland	LOCATION	:
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Yeats	PERSON	,
George Moore	PERSON	, `` A.E. , ''
Synge	PERSON	,
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, besides dozens of lesser or younger people like
James Stephens	PERSON	,
James Joyce	PERSON	,
Lennox Eobinson	PERSON	, and
Joseph Camp	PERSON	- bell , who have done memorable work and may do much more .

		Had it not been for a strain of queer pessimism which prevented him from taking his writing seriously ,
T. M. Kettle	PERSON	, the young Nationalist ex-M.P. who just died in battle at
Ginchy	LOCATION	, might have been one of the best-known of them all .

		His book of essays , `` The Day 's Burden , '' and a brilliant little introduction to a `` Life of Nietzsche '' are almost all that remains of him .

		I knew him only very slightly ; but he was certainly one of the best talkers I have ever met .

		He was very widely read , especially in philosophy .

		He wore his knowledge very lightly ; but although his talk coruscated with epigrams , the point of view was never sacri - ficed to the well-shaped witticism , and the wit always had a tinge of poetry .


Harold Chapin	PERSON	, the Anglo-American dramatist whose war letters have just appeared here , asked in one of the last letters he wrote before he was killed : `` Why do all the best ones get done in ? ''

		The thought is at least as old as Sophocles .


Chapin	PERSON	's book , though very few of the letters -LRB- mostly to his wife and child -RRB- betray the professional artist , is extremely interesting reading .

		It is the best war-book of the season so far , with the exception of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's `` Gallipoli , '' a very picturesque and stirring narrative marred only by an occasional too transparent attempt at fine writing and the grand style .

		It has been , so far , a thin season .

		The new Wells and
Bennett	PERSON	novels have had little to compete with , though Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	has done it again , and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	has produced a story of Oxford with a very odd hero and startling revelations of the melo - dramatic way in which undergraduates behave .

		Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's book of `` Tragedies '' has the interest of coming from a distinguished man ; but they are no more satisfactory than Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's earlier poems .

		The best of them , a Cornish peasant-drama , is as artificial as Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's `` Nan , '' which is saying a good deal , and it lacks the convincing patches that `` Nan '' has .

		You feel that it does not
spring	DATE	from any urgent impulse in Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's breast , that he merely sat down to write a play with a strong theme .

		Some of the speeches are very well written , but they lose their effect , as we do not believe that the characters concerned would have spoken them .

		There are draw - backs in being a critic of chameleon-like sym - pathy , who is able to feel with and expound every kind of art and artist .

		Macmillans , who have taken over the pub - lication of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's works , are to issue this autumn two new volumes by him , a collection of poems and a book of `` Reveries . ''

		Private issues of these already have come from the
Cuala Press	ORGANIZATION	, which is run by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's sister .

		These Cuala Press books , which are very pretty , may be commended to collectors .

		One of the best of them was a beautiful col - lection of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's `` Love Poems , '' pub - lished in
1913	DATE	.

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has for some years been writing his full reminiscences .

		Very probably , Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	would like to see them .

		But I do not think they will be on view for a good many years .

		One by one the authors of
England	LOCATION	are being officially invited to inspect the Allied fronts .

		It is a good idea .

		One can hardly say , I suppose , that its object is to secure publicity for the war , even although one military tribunal did encounter the other day a rural laborer who said he had never heard of it .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	are the latest to survey the field .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has spent a month in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, and will produce his impressions almost immediately .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has been doing the Grand Fleet ; per - haps his poems about the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	will improve a bit now .

		I take it that his return from
America	LOCATION	must leave you almost denuded of British authors , a most unusual situation for you .

		But , presumably , there will be the usual winter invasion of lecturers .

		One at least you will receive who has never visited
America	LOCATION	before .

		This is Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , the poet , who crosses the
Atlantic	LOCATION	some time this month .

		As I have probably remarked before , Mr. de la Mare is not half so well known as he should be .

		His volume , `` The Listeners , '' contains some of the most exquisite lyrics of our time .

		He is not a prolific writer .

		He is over forty and has pub - lished , I think , only four books of verse and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 341 three of prose , a very clean record for a twentieth-century author .

		But his books are all good .

		He takes immense pains with every - thing he does .

		His critical work is done mostly for the `` Times Literary Supplement , '' and it is extraordinary subtle and delightful , written in a poet 's prose , full of original and illuminating imagery .

		I gather that Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, the poet and author of `` The Autobiography of a Supertramp , '' may fol - low him later on .

		After the war you will probably get a great rush of us .

		A novelist I was dining with the other day told me that the best thing for us to do , however , would be to write for
America	LOCATION	, where remuneration is largest , and live in
Spain	LOCATION	, where food costs nothing and you can rent a Castle , with towers , ghosts , and loopholes , for a dollar a week -
J. C. SQUIRE	ORGANIZATION	.


London	LOCATION	,
October 5 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		INTERNATIONAL , COPYRIGHT IN WAR-TIME incurs risk of violation .

		How serious the actual violation has been during the present war , it is too early to determine .

		But even among embittered belligerents there is not lacking a feeling that respect for copyright should be observed even amid the din of arms .

		The
German Booksellers ' Union	ORGANIZATION	, through its
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	in consulta - tion with the German General Staff , admits that copyright laws with enemy countries have lost their validity , but adds that works published in these countries before the war continue nevertheless to receive copyright protection ; and the honorable sentiment fol - lows that even for books now appearing in enemy countries the law of copyright should hold .

		But it is further added , perhaps lest this should seem too idealistic a view of the situation , that were open piracy resorted to the German book-trade might suffer serious injury through reprisals on the part of hostile nations .

		Reprisal is something all can under - stand in these days , however it may be with abstract right or wrong .

		We no longer live in the primitive times of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's Squire , with whom '' 't was a maxim he had often tried , that right was right , and there he would abide . ''

		LIBRARY RAMIFICATION goes on apace , espe - cially in this country .

		In addition to the excel - lent public libraries dotted over the land we have an increasing number of special libra - ries , devoted to all subjects from poetry to patent rights ; and nearly every state has its legislative reference library , most large cities have their municipal reference libraries , and now our largest city is to have its public health library , as a division of or adjunct to its municipal reference library .

		State libraries and city-hall libraries and chamber - of-commerce libraries are , of course , common - places by this time .

		No wonder it has been complained as , for example , by Dr.
C. C. Williamson	PERSON	in his address at
Asbury Park	LOCATION
last June	DATE	that the word `` library '' is becom - ing sadly overworked .

		A new term , several new terms , in fact , are needed to denote suc - cinctly and unmistakably the differing char - acters and purposes of the many offshoots from the parent library stem .

		How little did
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	foresee what was to come in the library world when he and his fellow members of the Junto started what has been called the mother of all subsequent subscrip - tion libraries in
America	LOCATION	, which in turn opened the way for our great public library system .

		It is worth while to turn back , now and then , and read his own account of that modest but memorable undertaking .

		When he settled in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, he tells us , there was no good bookshop south of
Boston	LOCATION	, and far less any good library .

		`` Those who lov 'd reading were oblig 'd to send for their books from
England	LOCATION	; the members of the Junto had each a few .

		We had left the alehouse , where we first met , and hired a room to hold our club in .

		I propos 'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room , where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences , but become a common benefit , each of us being at liberty to borrow such as we wish 'd to read at home .

		This was accord - ingly done , and for some time contented us . ''

		And lucky it was for posterity that the con - tentment was only temporary .

		POETRY IN APPLES has no less reality , to the discerning , than tongues in trees , or books in the running brooks , or sermons in stones .

		Immortalized by the poets are the golden apples given as a wedding present to Juno by
Ge	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Earth -RRB- and guarded by the maidens known as the Hesperides .

		Significant to us in
America	LOCATION	is the fact that these superb examples of their kind were ascribed in classic legend to the far West , or sometimes to the distant North .

		Thus the ancients , whether by design or accident , placed the best apples where as a matter of fact they do actually grow .

		Here is no place for an apple bibliog - raphy , but any reference to the apple in lit - erature can hardly fail to call to mind the fine appreciation of this fruit shown by Mr.
John	PERSON	342 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	Burroughs in his writings .

		Poetic apprecia - tion of the apple has lately been evinced in a far different and very unexpected quarter .

		The
International Apple Shippers ' Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , in some of its `` literature '' -LRB- not so inap - propriately named in this instance -RRB- quotes with excellent effect from the popular poetry on the subject .

		What could be better of its sort than that briskly jingling set of pomolog - ical rhymes entitled `` The Bulliest Fruit of Them All '' ?

		Here is a sample stanza , to go with the next rosy-cheeked
Baldwin	PERSON	the reader has the good fortune to enjoy : There 's a tang to the taste of an apple , A zest like the keen autumn breeze , With a savor that 's won from the smile of the sun When it ripened the fruit on the trees .

		CONFISCATING AN ENEMY 'S LITERARY PROP - ERTY wears in some respects an uglier look than the confiscation of an equal amount in real estate or barrels of flour or tons of pig - iron ; for in the republic of letters there is supposed to be no clash of arms , and mutual respect of personal rights is taken for granted .

		England 's action in giving parliamentary sanction to the violation of the
Berne Con	ORGANIZATION	- vention , so far as enemy countries are con - cerned , is deplorable .

		The appointment of a
Public Trustee	ORGANIZATION	to guard the interests of the enemy author , whose literary work is repro - duced without his consent , will not suffice to make this breaking of a treaty seem right and honorable .

		It is a tortuous casuistry that seeks to defend it .

		It will not fail to be noted that
Germany	LOCATION	has thus far refrained from making `` a scrap of paper '' of the
Berne	PERSON	agreement .

		`` Gooo BOOK WEEK , '' known last year as `` Safety First Juvenile Book Week , '' will be observed early in
December	DATE	from the 4th to the 9th inclusive .

		This will be the second observance of what has proved to be a very successful literary festival .

		Last year more than three hundred cities and towns shared in this success , and nearly sixty thousand copies of the specially prepared list , `` Books Boys Like Best , '' were distributed .

		The Chief Scout Librarian of the Boy Scouts prepared the list , with the help of an official
Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	; and the same list , revised and somewhat enlarged , will this year again be circulated .

		`` The Publishers ' Weekly '' prints the list as a supplement to its issue of
October 14	DATE	, and announces its purpose to supply the trade with copies at cost .

		Public libraries , as was to have been expected , have taken active part in this effort to raise the standard of boys ' reading ; and schools , churches , news - papers , and literary periodicals have also for - warded the movement .

		Such an enterprise , so well organized , and supported by an asso - ciation like that of the Boy Scouts of
America	LOCATION	, with the cooperation of American librarians , can not end in failure .

		Good results , already noted , will be followed by better ; and in this connection even the mounting price of paper may prove a blessing in disguise by curtailing , if not altogether stopping , the supply of cheap sensational trash such as boys in the past have indulged in with too little restraint .

		THE RETURN OF THE PALIMPSEST may be one of the results of the portentous rise in the price of paper .

		Already old stock is made over again into paper with much more of care to avoid waste than has been known before in the lifetime of the oldest observer .

		If a cheap and effective process could be invented for removing print from paper , something like the ancient custom of using parchment more than once might come into vogue .

		Meanwhile word comes from
Canada	LOCATION	that the paper industry there is in as critical a condition as in our own country .

		Not only forest-destruc - tion and a scarcity of chemicals used in this industry have helped to create a shortage , but labor is also unobtainable in a supply equal to the demand , so many men have enlisted for the war .

		Thus in material , in labor , and probably also in capital , paper-manufacture is a sufferer from the European conflict .

		But is there any industry , except the making of munitions , or any class , except the makers of munitions , that does not suffer from the same cause ?

		The world needs some
Menenius Agrippa	PERSON	to bring it to its senses by putting into apposite fable the interdependence of all the members of the cosmopolitan body .

		THE TRUE STORY OF THE CHILDREN 'S LIBRARY BUILDING ought to be told here in correction of an earlier chronological error in this depart - ment of bibliothecal history .

		As
Miss A. L. Sargent	PERSON	, librarian at
Medford	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, has been kind enough to point out ,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	is not entitled to first honors as inaugurator of the separate library building for young people ; nor indeed is
Medford	LOCATION	, as she had at first believed , the pioneer in this movement .

		She has now very kindly and carefully straight - ened out the whole matter for us , and with full confidence in the accuracy of her findings we are glad to name in the order of their age the separate juvenile library buildings in
America	LOCATION	so far as
Miss Sargent	LOCATION	's researches
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 have discovered their existence .

		New
London	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, opened its children 's library building in
June , 1906	DATE	;
Medford	LOCATION	took similar action
Jan. 7 , 1912	DATE	;
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, followed suit later in the same year , that is on the 23d or 24th of
October	DATE	; and
Brooklyn	LOCATION	fell into line
Sept. 24 , 1914	DATE	.

		If there are any slighted candidates for admission to this list , let them declare themselves .

		FURTHER ITEMS FROM THE INFORMATION DESK , which has more than once been men - tioned in these columns in comment on library happenings , may find an interested reader or two .

		The St.
Joseph	PERSON	-LRB-
Mo.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library has in the last year established an informa - tion desk , where in seven months no fewer than twenty-five hundred questions were asked some easy and others so difficult as to approach the character of conundrums .

		The librarian reports : `` Over the telephone have come questions concerning spelling , pronun - ciation , etiquette , the population , location , and altitude of places , with such inquiries as ` What great man 's mother died when he was a baby ? '

		` Receipt for marshmallows ' ; and ` On what dates did Thursdays come in
May , 1911	DATE	? ' ''

		Let us try to imagine the bewilder - ment caused at another information desk , no matter just where , by a rather unusual in - quiry sent over the telephone in tearful tones by a person conjectured to be an anxious wife or mother .

		The question was this : `` Will you please tell me what are those little white things men have in their heads that bite ? ''

		It was not until the next day that even the nimble-witted functionary in charge of the desk was able to answer this conundrum .

		Then a sudden light illumined the darkness , and the inquirer having been rung up , the monosyllabic reply was sent back , '' Teeth ! ''

		It will need a harder question still to score a point against that desk .

		THE VARIED ACHIEVEMENTS OF
NORMAN DUNCAN	PERSON	, author , traveller , teacher of litera - ture and rhetoric , and , not least of all , admirer of Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	and expounder of the missionary movement headed by the latter in
Labrador	LOCATION	, are enough to fill more space than can here be allotted to them .

		His death on the
18th of October	DATE	cut short his activities in the mid-forties .

		He was born in
Ontario	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	, educated at
Toronto University	ORGANIZATION	, was on the staff of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' from
1896	DATE	to
1901	DATE	, filled the Chair of Rhetoric at
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson College	ORGANIZATION	from
1902	DATE	to
1906	DATE	, taught English literature as adjunct professor at the
University of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	from
1896	DATE	to
1901	DATE	, filled the
Chair of Rhetoric	ORGANIZATION	himself chiefly to writing and travel .

		To various magazines he contributed articles on
Newfoundland	LOCATION	,
Labrador	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	,
Palestine	LOCATION	, the Arabian desert ,
Australia	LOCATION	,
Papua	LOCATION	, and the Dutch East Indies .

		Among his numerous books may be named `` The Way of the Sea , '' `` Dr.
Luke	PERSON	, '' `` The Mother , '' `` Dr.
Grenf	PERSON	ell 's Parish , '' `` The Adventures of
Billy Topsail	PERSON	, '' `` The Cruise of the Shining Light , '' `` Every Man for Himself , '' `` The Measure of a Man , '' and `` The Best of a Bad Job . ''

		Though made an honorary Litt.D .

		by
Pittsburgh University	ORGANIZATION	in
1912	DATE	, his breezy narratives of adventure on sea and land show him to have been far from our conception of the typical doctor of letters as his many readers have convinced them - selves , to their enjoyment and advantage .

		THE MENTION OF THE NEW POETRY recalls the fact that there has recently appeared an - other periodical devoted entirely to the publi - cation of verse .

		We have already had in our midst for varying periods `` Poetry , '' `` The Poetry Journal , '' and `` Contemporary Verse , '' not to cite several English publications .

		Now appears `` The Poetry Review , '' edited by
Wil	PERSON	- liam
Stanley Braithewaite	PERSON	, and published at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		An inspection of the first two numbers inclines the disinterested critic to agree with Mr.
Brian Hooker	PERSON	in his frank let - ter of criticism of the initial number , a criti - cism , by the way , engagingly printed in the succeeding
June	DATE	issue .

		Briefly , the new maga - zine , while generous and inclusive in its pro- nouncement to further the poetical art and its criticism to the fullest , falls short in achievement .

		Barring a somewhat painfully vivid but very interesting poem by
Amy Lowell	PERSON	in the free manner there was scarcely anything of note in the first two numbers read .

		Platitudinous and indiscrim - inate praise , and verse that only too fre - quently savors of the `` pretty-pretty '' of the so-called regular magazines , does not serve to carry out Mr.
Braithewaite	PERSON	's professed inten - tion to wage war against this sort of thing .

		The same qualities of discrimination or lack of discrimination in critical judgments mar also , it seems in the opinion of many critics , the editorial comment and selection in Mr.
Braithewaite	PERSON	's annual `` Anthology of
Maga	PERSON	- zine Verse . ''

		But Mr.
Braithewaite	PERSON	's long - acknowledged and unremitting devotion to the furtherance of a love of poetry , particu - larly contemporary poetry , should in the end prove a sufficient corrective of the present lack of balance in `` The Poetry Review . ''

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	NEW STUDIES OF
HENRY JAMES	PERSON	.

		* Most published criticisms of the work of
Henry James	PERSON	give little aid to the reader who would clarify and crystallize his own judg - ments of that author .

		Indeed , one need spend but an hour or two with essays and magazine articles to gather a collection of the most diverse opinions .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	asserts that no one ever cares to read the novels a second time .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	makes much of the fact that they invite repeated re-readings .

		One critic remarks that `` He sees his subject not as a spot , detached , isolated ; he sees it in its place , as part of a whole , of a system . ''

		Another says : `` The actors in Mr.
James	PERSON	's books appear to have the world entirely to themselves : there is no suggestion or sense that other lives are being lived around them . ''

		We are told that he puts his own personality into every one of his characters , and that he never expresses his personality at all ; that the novels suffer from the limitations of his narrow Puritanism , and that they are so licentious that they would be suppressed if they could be understood .

		`` And , '' as his own characters so often say , `` there you are ! ''

		Much of this confusion comes from a failure of critics to apply and real standards to make the criticism actually meet with the work criticized .


Henry James	PERSON	had , more probably than any other writer of fiction , an idea of what a novel should be .

		He expounded this idea with care , and he elucidated it by frank discussions of his own stories .

		The only profitable criticism of such an author is that which considers as its essential problems how far his conception of the literary form is sound , and how well he has lived up to his theory .

		The expression of personal likes and dislikes , the clever recording of impressions produced by particular tales , or the judg - ment of work by implied standards , however conventional , which the author himself rejects , can have little value , and may be confusing .

		This misfit criticism was to be expected in the earlier years , before it was wholly evident what Mr.
James	PERSON	's conception of a novel was ; but since he has explained this in his essays and prefaces , and exemplified it in a score or two of volumes , mere hit-or-miss comment seems unnecessary .

		Nevertheless , the period - ical articles called forth by
James	PERSON	's death , though full of brilliant and telling observa - * HENRY JAMES .

		tions , are largely unsystematic and inad - equate , and the same must be said of the two new volumes on James that we have now to consider .

		The lesser of these , a little book by Miss
Rebecca West	PERSON	, in the `` Writers of the Day '' series , is announced as `` a biography and a critical estimate of his works , with portrait and bibliography , '' but the biographical infor - mation is of the slightest , and the bibliog - raphy is merely a list of `` first editions of publications in book form . ''

		The standards of style which the author sets herself may be inferred from the occurrence of such sen - tences as this : `` He was becoming a European and for several years to come was to spend his time slowly mastering its conventions . ''

		Although the `` Author 's Note '' naively thanks the publishers for the loan of the ``
New York	LOCATION	Edition '' of
James	PERSON	's works , there is no evidence of the reading of the remarkable prefaces in that edition .

		The `` critical estimates '' are mostly brief comments on novels and tales .

		At first glance these may seem to be com - pounded according to the simple rule of a shovelful of censure and a shovelful of praise , but more careful reading shows that they are based on certain unsystematized , and in some instances conflicting , personal standards which the author brings to her work .

		Evidently she is an advanced social reformer .

		She speaks of `` the caste of cretins who edit the magazines and reviews of this unhappy coun - try '' ; she is irritated by a society that con - siders a chaperone desirable for young women ; she sneers at the
New England	LOCATION	`` respect for spinsters and pastors of bleached lives '' ; and her contempt for `` Victorian '' writings is so great that she would prove
James	PERSON	's utter incompetence as a critic by the fact that he once wrote a gracious sentence about Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		But along with these sociological conceptions goes a sense of the importance of art , and a real feeling for some of the finer things of life .

		Such heter - ogeneous collections of ideas and ideals are common enough to-day .

		A university teacher finds them with painful frequency in the minds of really womanly young women who have felt it their duty to go in for social psychology and eugenics and criminology , and who have absorbed notions more rapidly than they can reconcile and correlate them .

		The master himself might have enjoyed the game of guessing in advance how a mind so equipped would respond to the appeal of his various stories .

		The reader of Miss West 's book who indulges in this amusement may or may not be surprised to learn that `` The American '' is `` an exposition of the way things
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 do not happen , '' largely because the char - acter of
Madame de Centre	ORGANIZATION	can not be recon - ciled with approved ideas of heredity .

		He will be told that the critic finds ``
Washington	LOCATION	Square '' highly praiseworthy .

		Of the `` For - 1 trait of a Lady '' he will read in a character - istic sentence : `` The conduct invented for Isabel is so inconsistent and so suggestive of the nincompoop , and so clearly proceeding from a brain whose ethical world was but a chaos , that it is a mistake to subject the book to the white light of a second reading . ''

		True , he may never know whether it was James or Isabel `` whose ethical world was but a chaos , '' or which of the two the writer would like to call a nincompoop , but he can hardly miss the tone of the criticism .

		He will be told that in the `` Princess Casamassima ''
James	PERSON	`` pro- duced a picture gallery where he had intended a grave study of social differences , '' and that the `` The Turn of the Screw '' is `` the best ghost story in the world . ''

		He will also find that `` The Wings of the Dove '' deserves the high - est praise , `` The Better Sort '' and `` The Awk - ward Age '' are `` twitterings over teacups , '' and `` The Golden Bowl '' `` is not good as a novel . ''

		But he who would learn more must read the book for himself , even to the last sentence , which concludes the strange mixture of judgments more rhetorically than logically : `` And on 28th
February , 1916	DATE	, he died , leav - ing the white light of his genius to shine out for the eternal comfort of the mind of man . ''

		Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	's critical study , now first brought out in
America	LOCATION	, appeared in
London	LOCATION	early in
1914	DATE	, and is reprinted appar - ently without change .

		It takes no account , therefore , of the important events of the
last two years	DATE	of
Henry James	PERSON	's life , and it gains no advantage from the clearing and illumina - tion of the critical view that comes with an author 's death .

		As in all his essays Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	writes of many things , and perpetu - ally indulges his fondness for epigrams and superlatives .

		He tells the reader , for example , that
Defoe	PERSON	, Fielding ,
Richardson	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Meredith	PERSON	had n't a pennyworth of art among them ; that the really great writers of our day , besides
James	PERSON	, are Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	-LRB- who has had the j honor of collaborating with Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	-RRB- and I Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	; that business `` is a mat - ter of dirty little affairs incompetently handled by men of the lowest class of intelli - gence '' ; and that `` The Yellow Book '' `` rep - resents the high-water mark of English achievement in the world of the arts . ''

		All these dicta are somehow connected in the mind of the author , if not in that of the reader , with the supreme dictum that
Henry James	PERSON	`` is the greatest man now living '' -LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- .

		A work written at such a time , in such a spirit , and after such a plan , can not be the definitive criticism of
Henry James	PERSON	; but Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	knows his author thoroughly , and is himself a practitioner of the same art .

		More - over , he has thought earnestly if erratically on many of the problems with which the elder novelist was concerned ; and his ideas , when once the reader has extracted them from the verbiage , are suggestive and worthy of consideration even by those least likely to accept them .

		Among the contentions that he ingeniously supports is one to the effect that indirection of statement is an Anglo-Saxon characteristic , and that elaborate figurative indirection is more American than English ; so that `` As far as his phraseology goes he -LSB-
James	PERSON	-RSB- has expressed his race . ''

		In another connection he traces a line of literary descent from
Richardson	PERSON	through a series of Contin - ental writers
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	,
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Turgenieff	LOCATION	, and back to
England	LOCATION	with
James	PERSON	.

		He finds the latter novelist wholly without `` compassion or any desire to be helpful . ''

		He gives much space to showing that
James	PERSON	, after his earlier years , was obsessed by a profound sense of sadness , of the wretchedness of life , that , in short , his attitude may be seen from the remark of the Passionate Pilgrim that most persons haven ' t souls .

		These are a few of the opinions that the present reviewer would gladly dis - cuss if his space were unlimited ; and every interested reader is likely to find a different list which will seem to him equally worthy of controversial comment .

		The critic carries on his discussion under three headings : Subjects , Temperaments , Method .

		In characteristic fashion he tells us that the third of these is the only one in which he is interested , but that he shall say little about it , since `` Mr.
James	PERSON	has done it himself '' in the prefaces .

		But for more than one reason few persons read the prefaces of the `` New York Edition , '' and those who do are tempted , not to silence , but to a fuller discussion of the principles there set forth with so much originality .

		It is just these matters treated in the prefaces which Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	, himself a novelist with serious ideas concerning his art , owed it to the reader to discuss .

		It seems that mere perversity and the desire to do the unexpected thing must have led Him to put in this last chapter only a few generalizations and a number of long quotations from James himself .

		The competent , scholarly , and judicial eval - uation of
Henry James	PERSON	's work , and of his - THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	place in the development of the English novel , is still to appear .

		When it is written it will doubtless contain a chapter on the criticisms that were published during the life of the novelist ; and in this there should be some interesting paragraphs on this clever , sugges - tive , and slightly amusing study by Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	.

		A STUDY OF THE SINGLE TAX PHILOSOPHY .

		* It must be generally felt by the thoughtful public that some authoritative statement is now due as to how we stand in relation to the agitation for a freer use of the land and natural resources of the country .

		That agita - tion has expressed itself in many and various ways .

		We have had outcries about the upward tendency in the prices of commodi - ties , due , as is affirmed , to the restricting of output made possible by the monopolistic con - trol of the sources of supply .

		We have had complaints of the action of railroad companies in withholding from use the large tracts of land originally given to them by government , and the capitalization of their potential value as a basis on which to pay , as dividends , the excess earnings which ought to have gone to increase the efficiency of service or to the reduction of rates .

		We have had , through the labors of the Industrial Relations Com - mission , a revelation of the helplessness of vast masses of laborers in the hands of organ - ized capital , forcing upon us the suspicion that this helplessness is largely , if not wholly , due to the restriction of opportunity for self - employment , and the consequent prevention of that natural drafting-away of those small margins of over-supply of labor which con - stitute the real menace to the security of the worker .

		Finally , we have had those various efforts at fiscal reform , local option in taxa - tion , lower-rent movements , anti-poverty societies , exemption of personal property and improvements , etc. , all of which are not unreasonably suspected of being expedients directed toward one ultimate end , the con - centration of public burdens upon the unim - proved value of land , or , in a word , to the Single Tax .

		It seems , then , as though the time is ripe for just such a book as `` The Single Tax Movement in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Arthur Nichols Young	PERSON	.

		And that a right understanding of what the Single Tax really * THE SINGLE TAX MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES .

		means may be best brought home to us by an account of its early beginnings and a history of its unfolding and development , every careful reader of this book will acknowledge .

		An idea , demanding structural changes in the economic relations between men , can only have come into existence in response to some real need , or as a consequence of some felt injustice , discomfort , or wrong ; and to under - stand the nature of this wrong is half way to understanding the meaning of the innovating idea .

		This idea , making as it does for equity or equality in men 's relationship to the nat - ural resources of the planet , is as old as his - tory ; and wherever it is found it is always in association with a revolt of the moral sense against the inequalities of fortune , the unearned and undeserved luxuries of the rich , and the equally undeserved miseries of the poor and down-trodden .

		Dr.
Young	PERSON	says in his Introduction : An attempt to consider the numerous manifesta - tions of the idea to which land reformers of all times have appealed .

		.

		would take us too far afield .

		Hardly any agrarian movement fails to exhibit some manifestation of this idea , which dates back at least to the time when the author of
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	wrote that the `` profit of the earth is for all . ''

		But indications of `` the idea '' are to be found even further back in history .

		When Moses laid down the law that there should be a year of Jubilee in which all land tenures should cease and a re-apportionment take place , it is obvious that he was simply adopt - ing an expedient for averting the inequal - ities in condition that he saw must inevitably arise if unrestricted private control of the land were continued indefinitely .

		To both of those great souls the idea had revealed itself that the well-being of a people , including all its future possibilities of moral and spiritual development , depends upon the ease or diffi - culty with which access can be had to the source of all wealth , the land .

		It is a reason - able postulate , therefore , that if we wish to deal intelligently with the question , and to assess rightly the importance of the land - reform movement , we must seek to realize its honorable pedigree , its emergence in the minds of the early masters in the art of sociology , and its persistence in some form in the philosophies of all great thinkers of sub - sequent ages .

		Dr.
Young	PERSON	quotes
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	as having declared in
1890	DATE	that political econ - omy , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	, had `` suffered inexpressibly from public indiffer - ence , '' and that `` the few who have professed and cultivated it have had things all their own way simply because no one cared enough
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 about it to contest or criticize their conclu - sions . ''

		This charge of popular indifference can be preferred no longer .

		Many indica - tions , which can be ignored only by the wil - j fully blind , point to a growing interest in the science of economics , and a determination on the part of the masses to have the `` social problem '' probed to the bottom .

		In the same year Professor
Ely	PERSON	wrote , as quoted by Dr.
Young	PERSON	: `` Are property rights safe ?

		I have no fear about the property rights of the individual , but I have much fear that the property of the public will be stolen in the future as it has been too frequently in the past . ''

		While one may experience a slight shock of surprise on finding so conservative a writer using an expression suggestive of deliberate fraud , yet a candid survey of the past twenty - five years must convince us that the fears of Professor
Ely	PERSON	have been realized .

		Immense blocks of public property have been `` appro - priated '' to private purposes .

		The free offer - ings of nature in the form of oil wells , iron and copper deposits , water-powers , etc. , to which public necessities and public expendi - tures in providing governmental facilities have given a monopoly value , have been taken possession of and exploited for private profit .

		These facts are being driven home to the con - sciousness of the plain man in the most effec - tive way , through an increase in the cost of living , and this makes it impossible that the indifference to the science of sociology can continue .

		The plain man wants to under - j stand the meaning of the increasing strenuos - ity in the struggle to live , and an instinct warns him that this can only come through a right comprehension of that science of economics in conforming to which must lie all our chances of attaining social well-being .

		Dr.
Young	PERSON	has , in the most admirable man - ner , adopted and maintained the attitude of `` the man from Mars , '' the impartial observer and reporter .

		Without sympathy for the social regeneration at which the Single Tax aims , it would have been impossible for him to have reached so complete an understanding of its meaning , as indeed we may affirm that it is not possible to understand anything fully if not approached in a sympathetic spirit .

		But so carefully has the role of the expositor been kept uppermost and dominant that no trace of the partisan can be discovered .

		So far as the Single Tax is to be regarded merely as a fiscal measure , as an ideal method of revenue-raising , Dr.
Young	PERSON	may be , for all that we can find in his writing , an opponent of its central principle , that of concentrat - ing all public burdens on economic rent and abolishing other taxes .

		But that he has been signally successful in laying before his readers the whole case , for and against , its failures and successes , its dangers and weaknesses as well as its essential elements of strength , every sincere critic must admit .

		The outstanding fact which our author recognizes , and which must be conceded by all whose memories extend backward for thirty years , is that the doctrine of
Henry George	PERSON	seems to have lost the hold it then had taken in the minds of the thoughtful classes .

		Whether this is due , as has been maintained by Mr.
Fillebrown	PERSON	, to its having been made a political issue , and thereby the cause of antagonisms , misrepresentations , and misun - derstandings , may be a question on which difference of opinion will be found among Single Taxers .

		The perspective in which recent events are seen is proverbially untrue , and the atmosphere which only time can pro- vide seems always necessary for the grouping of facts in their proper relations .

		Of one thing we may feel sure , however , that if the minds of the more cultured classes have become more or less closed by the political propaganda and its consequences , those of the masses have been opened to the fact that there is an economic problem underlying their miseries , and that a solution of it has been offered by
Henry George	PERSON	.

		This last consideration should be kept in mind to bal - ance any regrets a Single Taxer may feel regarding the loss of countenance from the platform and the professorial chair , and as an offset to the words of Dr.
Young	PERSON	: `` It is an important practical question for Single Taxers as to whether any given political cam - paign is timely .

		Whatever advance the
Single Taxers	ORGANIZATION	can make when their program is under - stood , they can manifestly expect little when it is not understood . ''

		That some combination of influences has during the past thirty years estranged the sympathies of those whose sup - port it is essential to capture , is attested by many circumstances ; and unless we may con - fidently believe that this is counterbalanced by an increased recognition on the part of the masses of the great issue that has been presented to the country , the outlook would indeed be depressing .

		In the meantime , it is a matter of satisfaction that influences have been and are at work , making appeal in terms of sweet reasonableness to the minds of those whose sympathies have been lost by the cam - paigning methods and the controversial dust raised thereby .

		Chief among these we must reckon the writings of Mr.
Fillebrown	PERSON	, whose `` A. B. C. of Taxation '' and series of pam - phlets are remarkable not more for their clarity of thought than for their freedom 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	from all that can offend refined and sincere thinkers or obscure the issues involved by the raising of class feeling .

		Dr.
Young	PERSON	has done no more than justice to the educational value of Mr.
Fillebrown	PERSON	's writings in classifying him with Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	as `` perhaps the ablest and most successful propagandist writers since
Henry George	PERSON	'' ; and it will greatly gratify the admirers of both these teachers that the memory of the one and the past and present activities of the other are given due recognition .

		Until
1887	DATE	`` the
Henry George	PERSON	movement , '' `` the land restoration movement , '' and other such expressions had sufficed to identify the wave of enthusiasm that had spread itself across two continents ; but the need was being felt for a shorter and more convenient term which might be expected to find acceptance in all countries .

		About this time Mr.
Thomas G. Shearman	PERSON	suggested to Mr.
George	PERSON	the adoption of the term `` Single Tax '' as a description of the method proposed for the restoration of society 's rights in the rental of land , and under this name the movement has since been known .

		Its inadequacy as an expression of the full creed of the Single Taxer has been felt increasingly as the years have gone by ; and many of
Henry George	PERSON	's disciples have since regretted that Mr.
Shear	PERSON	- man did not in
1887	DATE	suggest the title under which he subsequently published his masterly work , `` Natural Taxation : An Enquiry into the Practicability ,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and Ethics of a Scientific and
Natural Method of Taxation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Had the movement been known since
1887	DATE	as a demand for a `` natural tax , '' much misun - derstanding might have been avoided .

		The title seems almost self-explanatory .

		It sug - gests as in a flash what
Shearman	ORGANIZATION	's book so lucidly expounds , that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	has provided a simple method by which each citizen auto - matically and inevitably pays a yearly sum exactly proportional to the benefits he receives from the attentions of governments , local and national , and that the landlords or land - owners are the officials appointed by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	for the collection of this natural public rev - enue .

		The further implication seems almost to thrust itself upon a reflective mind , that if these natural tax-collectors did what tax - collectors are supposed to do , if they handed over their collections , minus an adequate remuneration for their labors , to the respec - tive governments who had authorized their functioning in this way , all would be well , and justice would prevail .

		Under such con - ditions it would no longer be necessary to tax labor , or the wealth that is produced by labor , for the support of governments .

		It would then be possible to abandon completely the unnatural principle of taking the citizen 's degree of affluence as a measure of his moral obligation to make contribution to the public exchequer , and to adopt instead the principle upon which we pay our electric current and water bills , the principle that payment shall be proportional to the amount consumed or to the degree of benefit received .

		For it is surely obvious , when the proposition is pre - sented as a fact in natural science and apart from the disturbing atmosphere which class controversy generates , that all the benefits a man derives from living in a special locality -LRB- police protection , postal facilities , well-kept roads , etc. -RRB- , are all accurately reflected in the price he must pay for the privilege of living there , not in the price of the house , for that is determined by the cost of production , but in the added value of the advantageous situa - tion , with all its publicly created conveniences and amenities .

		The superiority , we repeat , of `` the natural tax '' over `` the single tax '' as a name for the
George	PERSON	movement , is that it seems to provoke the above reflections , and at the same time to suggest its own explanation instead of inviting misunderstanding .

		In recounting the various metaphysical difficulties that have stood in the way of a broader acceptance of Single Tax principles , Dr.
Young	PERSON	rightly places first the conflict of ideas between
George	PERSON	's definition of `` the rightful basis of property '' as being rooted in a man 's right to himself and his labor , or what he called `` natural rights , '' and the opposite idea so strongly upheld by
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Ritchie	PERSON	,
Ely	PERSON	, and others , which denies the reality of natural rights and derives all rights from social utility .

		There is , it must be con - fessed , an apparent paradox or antinomy here ; but to one who has not acquired a mechanical turn of mind through habitual logic-chopping , and who has retained some - thing of the power of intuitive perception , there persists the suspicion that the contra - diction is only a seeming one , and can be resolved in thought if not in argument .

		May it not be , one instinctively asks , that each of the apparently contradictory concepts is con - tained in the other ?

		In accepting and follow - ing either to its furthest conclusions , is it not possible or probable that we shall find our - selves reaching the other ?

		If we concede to the orthodox student of social problems the postulate that social utility is the final test and justification of human rights , it is hardly conceivable that the adoption of this principle could lead us to an infringement of the other principle that wealth should be left in the hands of him who produces it .

		If , on the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 349 other hand , we start from an acceptance of \ what
George	PERSON	called natural rights , and deter - mine to respect them , it is equally inconceiv - able that this could lead to any inutility ; rather do the probabilities indicate that the highest social utility would be subserved in this way .

		On the whole , therefore , the seem - ing paradox appears hardly worth the effort of discussion .

		We are probably dealing once more with the opposite aspects of the same truth as seen from different points of view , like the assumed opposition between justice ; and expediency , which all moralists know to be a false one , nothing being in the end just that is not expedient and nothing expedient that is not just .

		On one point only we venture to join issue with Dr.
Young	PERSON	, and this merely as to the interpretation of an indisputable fact .

		Some Single Taxers have recently exhibited a tol - erance if not a sympathy for income taxes ; but this we believe does not `` signify a ten - dency to relax the strictness of the phrase single tax , or presage a weakening of the view that condemns all taxes but land taxes , on a priori grounds . ''

		Impatience with the blun - derings and injustices incident to the attempts to enforce property taxes upon those `` intan - gible '' forms that can be easily hidden has ' engendered a willingness to countenance any !

		method of revenue-raising that promises to be better than the prevailing system .

		It is to be hoped that Dr.
Young	PERSON	's book j will serve the double purpose of an appeal to that greater public , the people of all classes who in the last resort are the custodians of the public conscience , for an unbiassed con - sideration of the Single Tax philosophy ; and as a note of friendly warning to Single Taxers to learn by their past failures as well as by their successes , as to the attitude it were wisest to adopt in the future .

		It may be that a patient education of the public mind , with all the advantage of a probable reflex action upon the minds of the educators them - selves , will in the end be the more direct method of achieving the objects aimed at .

		If it is indeed a fundamental and eternal truth that underlies the idea of the Single Tax , the compelling power of such a truth should require no aid from diplomacy , policy , cun - ning , or any of the powers that fear the light .

		There should be no need to conceal the remot - est implications of such a truth , to whatever conclusions that they may seem to point .

		We heartily commend this latest contribution to the literature of the Single Tax movement .

		PROBLEMS AXD LESSOXS OF THE WAR .

		* During the course of each academic year there is held at
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	a conference upon some large problem of world politics .

		Having become an institution , this conference attracts notable groups of publicists , diplo - mats , university professors , and other persons interested in international affairs .

		And the several volumes of papers and discussions which preserve the proceedings of the con - ference form interesting and valuable addi - tions to the fast-growing literature of a critically important subject .

		One can well believe that , as President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	reports in his `` Foreword '' to `` The Problems and Lessons of the War , '' it was not without some natural hesitation that the authorities of the
University	ORGANIZATION	approved the plan to devote the conference of
December , 1915	DATE	, to a topic that `` has aroused throughout the world an intensity of feeling and a diversity of opinion which is without prece - dent in history , '' namely , the causes , char - acter , and meaning of the war in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The plan , however , was admirably conceived .

		For if sane and impartial discussion of the subject can be had anywhere , it is most likely to be within the precincts of academic walls ; and the cataclysm was not so new but that it was beginning to be possible for scholarly men to view it with some degree of perspec - tive .

		Notwithstanding initial misgivings , the conference was eminently successful , in respect not only to the representative char - acter of the persons who participated in it but also to the spirit which prevailed and the high quality of most of the addresses delivered .

		Under the editorship of Professor
Blakeslee	PERSON	, twenty-three of these addresses and papers are gathered in a volume entitled `` The Problems and Lessons of the War . ''

		In addi - tion to a `` Foreword '' by President
Hall	PERSON	, discussing briefly the psychology of the war , there is an Introduction by Professor
Blakeslee	PERSON	, containing a useful survey of the proposed solutions of the war problem .

		The twenty-three papers fall into eight groups .

		Six relate to the question of preparedness ; four to economic aspects of war ; five to pro- posals for restricting or eliminating war ; two to the `` test '' of war ; two to the relation of * THE PROBLEMS AND LESSONS OF THE WAR .

November 2	DATE	naturalized Americans to the present conflict ; two to the British and German points of view ; one to the effect of the war upon Pan-Amer - ican cooperation ; and one to the influence for peace of the Red Cross work .

		It is equally impossible to characterize in general terms a group of papers of such extensiveness and to speak of individual contributions to the exclu - sion of others .

		But when it is stated that included among the authors are
Norman Angell	PERSON	,
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, ``
William E. Walling	PERSON	,
Roger W. Babson	PERSON	, Rear Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	,
Samuel J. Elder	PERSON	,
Kuno Francke	PERSON	, and Senhor de
Oliveira Lima	LOCATION	, some idea is conveyed of the nature and worth of the book .

		It may be added that with practically no exceptions the contributors have taken their task or their opportunity seriously , and that the volume is pregnant with the best of contemporary thought in this country upon both the war in
Europe	LOCATION	and the lessons of the conflagration for the
United States	LOCATION	.

		When , a number of years ago , the work of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace	ORGANIZATION	was organized , provision was made for a
Division of Economics and History	ORGANIZATION	, under the directorship of Professor
John B. Clark	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, having as its purpose to `` promote a thorough and scientific investi - gation of the causes and results of war . ''

		In
1911	DATE
the Division	ORGANIZATION	convoked at
Berne	LOCATION	a con - ference of statesmen and economists which drew up an ambitious programme of investi - gations pertinent to the
Division	ORGANIZATION	's objects .

		One of these investigations had to do with `` the conditions under which the last wars in the
Balkans	LOCATION	were begun and waged , the situ - ation in which they left the combatant states , and the prospects of the future which might be anticipated as possible and probable . ''

		This piece of work was entrusted to a European scholar and diplomat whose name has been kept from the public ; and the recently pub - lished volume entitled `` Nationalism and War in the Near East '' is the fruit of the investi - gation .

		Lord
Courtney	PERSON	of
Penwith	LOCATION	, who edits the volume , assures us that the author knows the Near East at first hand , that he `` has moved in and out among Chancelleries , '' and that , in short , he has special qualifications for the task committed to him .

		It would seem very desirable , however , that the mask of anonymity should have been dropped .

		The book was written before the outbreak of the Great War in
1914	DATE	; and on that account several passages in it for example , one wherein the position of the
Prince of Wied	ORGANIZATION	is described as very secure and satis - factory now make curious reading .

		The author 's keenness of perception , however , is demonstrated by his interpretation of the
Near Eastern	ORGANIZATION	situation as one which was very likely to be productive of a conflict of the greater powers .

		In content the volume is substantially a study of the connection between nationalism and war , as exhibited in recent events in the Near East ; and the author expressed the hope that the picture which he painted would suggest some warn - ings to Western civilization of the fool 's paradise in which
Europe	LOCATION	was at the time living .

		In the excessive development of nationalism the author finds the fundamental cause of modern war ; and it may be remarked that in a paper by Professor
Krehbiel	PERSON	, in the above-mentioned `` Problems and Lessons of the War , '' the same conception is set forth with convincing effect .

		Nationalism , we are told , has been more prone to war-like expres - sion in
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	than in
Western Europe	LOCATION	, because the former is less highly developed .

		But even in the West the fail - ure of democracy to assert its control over diplomacy has meant that nationalism has continued to maintain a basis essentially mili - taristic and to be continually provocative of war .

		Only `` the re-establishment of the inter - national structure on a sounder foundation '' can prevent the recurrence of armed conflict .

		The chief importance of this admirably planned and executed volume lies in its inter - pretation of the
Near Eastern	ORGANIZATION	conditions im - mediately antedating the present war .

		These conditions furnished the occasion , and to a considerable extent the remoter causes , of the conflict .

		`` It is , '' the author affirms , `` the expansive force of the South Slav nationality communicating itself to
Russia	LOCATION	that has exploded the mines and magazines with which diplomatists and militarists had sapped the foundations of the European social structure .

		The South Slavs have been the fighting slaves and the farming serfs of
Central Europe	LOCATION	for centuries , and it is their struggle for freedom that has upset the European equilibrium and set in motion the mobilization machines .

		It is in part a visitation for the sins of their fathers toward the nations of the Near East that to-day the freemen of
Europe	LOCATION	are being rounded up by millions , railroaded to the front , and fed to the machine guns . ''

		A useful feature of the volume is a liberal collection of diplomatic documents covering Balkan affairs in the years 1912-13 .

		Alto - gether , the enterprise of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	and the work of the anonymous author must be commended without reserve .

		For a number of years Dr.
Alfred H. Fried	PERSON	has been numbered among
Europe	LOCATION	's keenest thinkers and ablest writers on international
1916	DATE	-RSB- 351 affairs .

		During decades , indeed , he has been attacking medisevalism and militarism in the German and Austrian Empires .

		A quarter of a century ago he assisted in the formation of the
German Peace Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		For fifteen years he published the Friedens-Warte -LRB- `` Watch-tower of Peace -RRB- in
Berlin	LOCATION	, and since the outbreak of the present war he has con - tinued it in
Zurich	LOCATION	.

		He has written a score of books , the best known in
America	LOCATION	being `` Der Kaiser und die Weltfriede '' ; and in
1911	DATE	he was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new volume by Dr. Fried , entitled `` The Restoration of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' takes rank easily among the sanest and most thoughtful of the hundreds of books whose publication has been prompted by the war .

		In a chapter on the causes of the contest the author sets up the thesis that the war is the logical outcome of the kind of `` peace '' that preceded it , and in succeeding chapters he abundantly substanti - ates his thesis by analyzing the international - anarchy which blind adherence to the prin - ciple of nationalism has entailed .

		In a trenchant chapter on the conflict 's lessons to date he urges that , with a view to the future prevention of war , the present struggle be studied very closely , in its economic and socio - logical , and not merely its military , aspects .

		Among the lessons which , it is affirmed , the war has enforced already are the fallacy of the time-honored maxim Si vis pacem para bell urn .

		the ineffectiveness of attempts to humanize and regulate warfare , the empti - ness of the notion that war is but a wholesome blood-letting and that there is something romantic about it , the impossibility under present-day conditions of localizing an inter - national conflict , and the tendency of modern j warfare -LRB- as
M. Jean Bloch	PERSON	pointed out twenty years ago -RRB- to be indecisive in its results .

		Finally , Dr. Fried writes inspiringly of the reconstruction which , as he hopes , will be j undertaken when the war shall close .

		The | world , he says , must not be satisfied to have j the war end in a peace ; it must insist that j there be established a durable peace that the j war shall destroy its own source , international anarchy , and result in the establishment of a rational state-system .

		A first conference of i the powers must arrange a cessation of hostil - ities , through the medium of an ordinary treaty of peace ; but a second must bring into being a new European international organi - zation .

		In the building up of the new
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- ' pean state-system compulsion must not enter .

		Rather the stimulant must be national self - interest .

		And it is suggested that a reasonably close analogy to the cooperative union which is to be desired is the Pan - American system of the western hemisphere .

		With this new order must come a complete transformation of the character of diplomacy , a sharp relaxa - tion of the `` antiquated conception '' of sover - eignty , an abandonment of the system of alliances whereby the great states have been set off one against another , and a regeneration of the political press .


Europe	LOCATION	, in short , must be recognized in a
Cooperative Union	ORGANIZATION	, with Pan-European Conferences and a Pan-Euro - pean
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, affording the instrumentalities whereby the nations may discuss together and reach conclusions upon their policies and interests .

		The programme may appear impracticable , but Dr. Fried advocates it con - vincingly ; and stranger things have happened than that , in its essentials , it should be realized .

		RECEXT FICTIOX .

		* I remember , even after thirty years or more , the surprise with which I listened to a man of the finest literary taste , who was enthusiastic about a book which told how a number of Englishmen had the most exciting adventures in the jungles and veldts of
South Africa	LOCATION	, in their effort to find certain mines of gold which had been unknown for cen - turies , in fact since the time of
King Solomon	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seemed very strange that a man who got pleasure out of
Trollope and Hardy	ORGANIZATION	,
James	PERSON	and
Howells	PERSON	, should care for what appeared to be simply a story of adventure .

		Yet my friend was not exceptional in that respect , but indeed was an early though typical voice in the general acclaim of popular approval which greeted the work of Rider
Haggard	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son ,
Kipling	LOCATION	,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, and many more whom we remember to-day better than the milder Blacks and Walfords and Norrises whom they rather displaced in the popular mind .

		Fiction in
1886	DATE	, say , had got so much the color of everyday life that there were those who thought it monotonous -LRB- in fact , even tedious -RRB- , and gray or drab .

		Stevenson in `` A Penny Plain and Twopence Colored '' pointed out that we really like color better than plainness , and he himself offered his generation plenty of the color that he liked , as well as other things .

		352 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	That change in popular and artistic taste has often seemed something particular , of its own day and generation , a turning-point in literary history , a sign of `` romantic reac - tion , '' and so forth , but in reality it was but a marked manifestation of a very general char - acteristic .

		There are always people who like the excitement of adventure , just as there are always people who like the observation of cur - rent existence ; sometimes there are more of one kind , sometimes of the other .

		But there are always both kinds ; in fact , generally , each individual is in varying degree of both kinds .

		There are plenty of people to-day who read with excitement Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's chronicles of the Five Towns and also Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's restless tales of the
Malay Islands	LOCATION	and the
South Seas	LOCATION	.

		Certainly al - though there are plenty of novels of current life nowadays , one can also pick out of the new books plenty of stories of adventure , as well as of romance and mystery , those other delightful matters so often mentioned together .

		Few such tales are more entertaining than `` The Romance of the
Martin Connor	PERSON	, '' by
Oswald Kendall	PERSON	, the story of an expedition of an ocean tramp steamer into the remote divagations of the upper
Amazon	LOCATION	.

		It seems an eccentric combination , the tossings about in the ocean and the confused complications of the tropical jungle , but just that eccen - tricity seems characteristic of the
Amazon	LOCATION	which has at once the vastness of the ocean and the seclusion of the forest .

		Mr.
Kendall	PERSON	appreciates this thoroughly and uses his abil - ities easily in both ways ; the account of the typhoon is fine and so is that of the myste - rious reaches of the upper river .

		But what will leave the strongest impression in the reader 's mind is the curious assortment of humanity that has gathered itself together in the ``
Martin Connor	PERSON	. ''

		`` We have at once such a sympathy with them that it is a great delight to feel sure that they will get safely through all their difficulties , and a great pleasure finally to know that they all attained at the end a successful competence , for which they doubtless cared less than we should .

		`` Cert ` nly Wilfred '' the cook is the bright particular star , but the others are very worthy associates , and all together they make such a sensible and cordial combination that in spite of a certain amount of kickings , beatings , and poundings , the story is a good tonic for the mind depressed about the condition of things at sea as it is presented by various more real - istic adventurers in current fiction .

		That seems a very good thing ; if you can get your story of adventure with anything amusing or interesting in the way of character thrown in , so much the better .

		There surely ought to be something beside adventure even in a story of adventure , perhaps a view of some new kind of country that seems strange but interesting to us who stay at home , perhaps a view of some form of human feeling that seems out of the way and fine to us who have got accus - tomed to the ordinary forms of current life .

		One may get both from Mr.
Kendall	PERSON	's tale , and perhaps it will be that that makes his book a bit more than a story of exciting things .

		Something of the same sort might be said of Mr.
White	PERSON	's book of African adventure , except that Mr.
White	PERSON	is a pretty well-known figure in our world of letters , and known for other things than exciting doings and inci - dents .

		He has given us many an impression of the vast forests and plains to the north of us , as well as of the mountain country in the west .

		Of late he has been in
Africa	LOCATION	and it is no surprise to have from his pen this story of the land of which he has otherwise written .

		This is a story , by a man who knows the land of the veldt of equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	, not a forest , yet not open , sunbaked and yet full of life .

		Into the midst of this unknown region go the people of Mr.
White	PERSON	's story .

		One must admit , though it is not very important , that the people rather lack the novel freshness of the sailor men of Mr.
Kendall	PERSON	's story ,
Kingozi	PERSON	the African traveler , the Leopard Woman her - self ,
Winkleman	PERSON	the scientist , though not exactly conventional , have not the touch of originality that one feels in Cert ` nly Wilfred and Captain
Hawkes	PERSON	.


Winkleman	PERSON	is the best , the great hunter is rather conventional , and the
Leopard Woman	ORGANIZATION	rather too extraordinary .

		But that is a slight matter in such a book , of which the main thing is to be that it is to show us exciting incidents and phases of life in a strange and out of the way corner of the now too well known surface of the earth .

		Here in the remote depths of unknown
Africa	LOCATION	come influences from the chaos of European life to-day .

		England and
Germany	LOCATION	are each bent on gaining over the great M'tela , an almost mythical ruler who holds great terri - tories on a needed line of communication .

		There certainly is good material even for a lesser hand than Mr.
White	PERSON	's .

		That I feel something wanting in the book probably comes from a middle-aged spirit that will not be satisfied with the excitements of incidents and the alleviations of suspense .

		I can not but ask for some more actual touch of the way people live and feel in that remote and savage and even appalling country , some actual touch of the European in
Africa	LOCATION	and of the native
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 353 African himself .

		But that was perhaps out - side of Mr.
White	PERSON	's plan , in spite of two or three African figures and the excellent account of the adventures with the magic bone .

		The curiosities of a wonderful scene , the exhilaration of plans carried through despite determined opposition , these were the main things in mind , and though his story is not without its touches of reality either European or African , its main interest will be as a story of adventure .

		This will not be said of `` Multitude and Solitude , '' one of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's earlier books now republished .

		Though spoken of as a story of adventure , and though much of the action takes place in
Africa	LOCATION	, yet the adven - tures are really those of the spirit , and the scene is really that of the human soul .

		It is indeed almost by false pretences that the book finds a place along with such others as Mr.
White	PERSON	's and Mr.
KendaU	PERSON	's .


Roger Naldrett	PERSON	is a man whose life is absorbed in the love of a beautiful woman and in the excitement of the art of letters .

		He meets disappointment .

		That his play is boo 'd by a commonplace audience is not disastrous , but that Ottalie should be drowned means an absolute wreck of everything .

		It is under such influences that he strangely gets in mind the thought of the sleeping-sickness in
Africa	LOCATION	, and is led to a determination to try to do something worth while in the fight against that terrible scourge .

		In following out this idea he does go to
Africa	LOCATION	, and in
Africa	LOCATION	there are adventures .

		But it is neither adventures nor
Africa	LOCATION	that were of chief interest to the author , nor will they be to the reader .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	seems to have been feeling his way in the great question , What is worth while in life ?

		It is not enough if life is full of motor-cars and golf .

		It is not enough that there should be sport and war .

		Is it enough even if it be full of plays and poetry ?

		Is it enough even if it have the love of one so fine as Ottalie ?

		Much the same sort of question may come in a minor way into the mind of one who reads books .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	was searching for something worth while .

		To get at something worth while , it was that which led
Roger	PERSON	and his friend and guide into those distant and lonely and appalling regions where he was enabled to do his little part in the general struggle of those who would put humanity a little way ahead in the great progress of centuries .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's last collection is a very characteristic one .

		It shows us
Jack London	PERSON	, not in all his phases , but in many .

		There is the tale of the big
California	LOCATION	ranch , the tale of the prehistoric tribe , of the winter trails of the Yukon , of the down-and-out hobo , of the mismanaged institution , of the pseudo - metaphysical and philosophic explorer of the secrets of existence .

		Nor does Mr.
London	LOCATION	seem at all conventional in following these trails wherein he has walked before ; affec - tion does not seem to stale his infinite variety .

		He has the same terse vigor with which he presents the point which seems to him worth while .

		For some point there generally appears to be ; he generally has something in mind beside the interest of the people or the inci - dents he tells about .

		I should like to read him better if I were more apt to agree with his points .

		It may not be a very critical ground to take that one does not like the philosophy of the story-teller .

		Certainly the lover of adventure finds himself in something of a dilemma in `` The Turtles of Tasman , '' the story which gives its name to the book .

		In this sketch we have a modern form of the Prodigal Son and his Elder Brother .

		There is no father in this case , so that the contrast is more obvious than in the original .

		Here are two brothers , good examples , the one of the vigorous and intelligent citizen , the other of the attractive , indeed entrancing adven - turer .

		Mr.
London	PERSON	takes an almost unfair advantage by allowing the returned prodigal a daughter of irresistible charm and dash , while the millionaire stay-at-home has an heiress whom nobody can care about in more than a formal way .

		That is heaping it up a little , but we might as well take conditions as we find them .

		The story certainly suggests the question why not all be adventurers ?

		Indeed I suppose that question must some - times occur even to us older readers of books of adventure .

		If it is such fun going up the
Amazon	LOCATION	or across the veldt or into the jungle , and if it also brings out all that is fine and loveable and attractive in a man , why do we timidly stick to our slippers and our chimney corner , and satisfy our longings with sterile emotive and abortive fancies ?

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	, of course , is perfectly consistent ; he has not done so , and does not , and in this story he tells us why .

		The reader may perhaps be able to work out the puzzle for himself .

		If in dealing with such ideas , the reader desires to know a little something about what the life of adventure really is , he may be recommended a reading of Sir
Hugh Clifford	PERSON	's `` The Further Side of Silence . ''

		This collection of stories and sketches of life in the Malayan peninsula is a very striking thing , for it gives us almost at first hand a picture of actual life in what is quite as good a field for adventure as the
Amazon	LOCATION	or the veldts or jungles of
Africa	LOCATION	or the Yukon .

		These stories have been compared with those 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	, but this must be chiefly because Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	and Sir
Hugh	PERSON	are telling stories of much the same sort of country , so that some of the same general figures may be seen in each .

		But with that resemblance ceases , and that for the reason that while Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	almost always looks on the Malay life from the outside , as a European , Sir
Hugh	PERSON	comes very near to presenting it from the inside , as near as any European can come .

		Such a story as `` At a Malayan Court '' gives me , at least , a more vivid idea than even Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's art of what life actually is in such a place .

		When one reads these stories of native life , the tales of the adven - tures of white men , say in the same unknown country , seem slight and sophisticated .

		If you compare Mr.
White	PERSON	's account of how Cul - bertson shot a rhinoceros and Sir
Hugh	PERSON	's story of how a tiger did up a household of seven Malayans you will feel a difference .

		A life of adventure , as we think of it , is a life where exciting things are always likely to happen .

		But in these lives of actual and invariable contest and struggle with rude nature and rude man there is a fierce inten - sity that seems somehow more the real thing than one can get in any temporary excursion into the African veldt or the South American forest .

		It is terribly in
earnest	LOCATION	; it is not so much adventure as tragedy .

		It is playing a game with the odds against one ; playing for keeps , as the boys used to say , and pretty deadly keeps at that .

		But whether so or not , it is an immensely interesting collection of stories and well worth reading for other reasons than the natural love of exciting incident .

		It has the touch of vitality that does so much to make fiction absorbing in its interest , whether it deal with exciting adven - tures in the strange places of the earth or the simpler existence in the quiet life of home .

Stevenson	PERSON	has called the `` brute incident . ''

		Few men to-day write , not so great a novel but so good a tale , as Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	has produced in some quantities .

		`` The Kingdom of the Blind '' is a moving tale of hairbreadth ` scapes by land and sea , not the least narrow of which is that of the hero and his beloved -LRB- enshrined also in the villain 's affections , of course -RRB- from a British hospital ship , torpedoed in the Channel by the directions of this same villain , Captain

British Army	ORGANIZATION	and the

		The treachery of a great British statesman and financier , a

		`` The Bird House Man , '' by

Bird House	ORGANIZATION	Man who is a friend to every flower and bird , and whose specialty is making matches and mending hearts . ''

		From which qualification it may be judged what manner of book `` The Bird House Man '' may be .

		Senti - mentalism run riot is the pith of the work .

		This
Bird House	ORGANIZATION	Man , without visible means of support other than a vast capacity for rambling about the woods with a pair of field-glasses , appears as the arbiter amorum of Southmead , and consummates within the compass of some three hundred and fifty pages so many matches among the youth of his neighborhood , and among those not so young as well , that one lays aside the book with the thought that he will be forced to an Alexandrine sigh for more worlds to marry .

		The book is recommended to all who revel in sentimentality .

		The writer who .

		engages upon the construction of an historical novel must meet certain difficulties , often enumerated by the critics , not the least of them being the problem of the language his char - acters shall employ .

$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , Mr.
George Hamlin Fitch	PERSON	attempts to introduce sixteen chosen American authors to any unfortunate who has no knowledge of our better literature .

		The choice of works suggested for first acquaint - ance and the brief working bibliographies are in most cases good .

		The criticism is of the sort which may place a half-dozen super - latives on a page .

		While a little over-praise doubtless piques the interest of an apathetic reader , it may be questioned if too much does not defeat the author 's purpose .

		Unfortu - nately Mr.
Fitch	PERSON	, like so many essayists who write of literary matters for the untrained public , has not thought it necessary to be accurate .

		The first sentence of the first essay credits
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's question `` Who reads an American book ? ''

		to
Jeffrey	PERSON	.

		Even more surprising are misstatements regarding the contents of works that the author praises and that he might be supposed to have read with care .

		To cite but a few examples :
Poe	PERSON	's `` Descent into the Maelstrom '' is not a tale `` of horror dealing with the great maelstrom that was once popularly supposed to be located at the poles '' -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- ;
Hawthorne	PERSON	's 356 THE DIAL -LSB-

Hester	PERSON	did not flee from her husband `` for love of
Arthur Dimmesdale	PERSON	, '' nor can it be said that `` the guilty couple sought a refuge '' in
New England	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 44 -RRB- .

		The inscription found over
Oakhurst	LOCATION	's body at the close of `` The Outcasts of Poker Flat '' is sadly muti - lated and misquoted -LRB- p. 124 -RRB- .

		Justly or unjustly , the journalist in literature has in recent years been accused of many sins , but he has usually been praised for a well-knit sentence structure .

		In view of Mr.
Fitch	PERSON	's long newspaper career it seems odd to note his apparent fondness for a type of sentence of which the following is an example : `` In these years he constantly practiced writing verse , and in
1827	DATE	he issued a first volume of poems through a
Boston	LOCATION	publisher , entitled
Tamerlane	LOCATION	, but it excited no comment . ''

		The illustrations are well chosen , but some of the inserted prints are rather muddy ; and in general the publisher seems to have planned a finer piece of bookmaking than he was able to realize .

		The vogue for things Russian , from the writings of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Gogol	PERSON	and
Sologub	PERSON	to the danc - ing of the
Imperial Ballet	ORGANIZATION	, has of course extended to Eussian music .

		For some time we have been familiar with
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	and
Zolotarieff	PERSON	and
Karatygin	PERSON	and Rimsky-Korsa - koff and
Moussorgsky	ORGANIZATION	, in operatic or sym - phonic or solo-instrumental form .

		Lately , moreover , there have been published a few collections of songs by composers well known in
Russia	LOCATION	but here heard for the first time .

		With hardly an exception these collections have included only songs of definitely artis - tic quality , such as are heard and sung only by Russians of intellect and culture .

		As interest in
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians grows , however , it is quite natural that there should arise a demand for something representative of the great mass of Russians , the common people .

		This want has been supplied in the field of literature : a characteristic of the Russian writers known on this side is their nearness to the soil .

		In music , we have had but few collections of folk-songs ; one of the first is `` Songs of the Russian People , '' edited by
Kurt Schindler	PERSON	and published in the `` Musicians ' Library '' -LRB-
Ditson	ORGANIZATION	,

		.

		The lyrics , translated by
Jane and Deems Taylor	PERSON	, are either set to the traditional melodies or to arrangements by modern composers , and are for mixed voices .

		Many of the ballads date back to mediaeval times ; all of them are sung to-day by the Russian peasants .

		The translators seem to have kept as closely as possible to Russian feeling and diction .

		The music , with its unexpected stresses and unfamiliar cadences , and its melodies as often as not in the bass , embodies many character - istics of Russian sacred music , such as may be heard in the ancient Gregorian chorals of the
Moscow Cathedral Choir	ORGANIZATION	.

		The question as to which influenced the other might prove an agreeable topic for discussion by the cognos - centi ; but the fact that the music and the words are of
Russia	LOCATION	, and of the Russian com - mon people , will be sufficient justification for the present volume with the average American musician .

$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, is a little misleading .

		The reader expects to find a violent diatribe ; he takes up the book with reluctance , anticipat - ing horror piled on horror .

		An agreeable surprise awaits him ; the tone , even of the earlier essays , written under the stress of the first shock , is one of restraint .

		Ger - many is condemned , at times with bitter - ness , but the rare invective that there is lacks the fiery power of that of
Verhaeren	LOCATION	, for example .

		As a polemicist
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck is a failure .

		Like
Ismene	PERSON	, he was born to love , not to hate .

		In his Preface he tells us that he has tried to lift himself above the fray , and he regrets that he could not succeed .

		`` It is possible that one day , when time has wearied remembrance and restored the ruins , wise men will tell us that we were mistaken and that our standpoint was not lofty enough ; but they will say it because they will no longer know what we know , nor will they have seen what we have seen . ''


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	sees first of all man 's heroism , individual and national , sustaining in the ser - vice of idealism an ordeal to which history can furnish no equal .

		He finds comfort in the thought that the world has become infin - itely richer as a result .

		`` All that our won - derful dead relinquish they bequeath to us ; and when they die for us , they leave us their lives not in any strained metaphorical sense , but in a very real and direct way .

		Virtue goes out of every man who falls while per - forming a deed of glory ; and that virtue drops down upon us ; and nothing of him is lost and nothing evaporates in the shock of a premature end .

		He gives us in one solitary and mighty stroke what he would have given us in a long life of duty and love . ''

		This is the note that has always pervaded
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck 's work and that one meets so frequently in Belgian literature to-day .

		Aside from the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 357 essays which , like that quoted , prove that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's philosophy has not deserted him in this terrible crisis , the most striking in the collection are perhaps those entitled - On Re-reading Thucydides , '' `` The Will of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' and `` When the War Is Over . ''

		In the first he establishes a parallel between the position of
France	LOCATION	against
Germany	LOCATION	and that of
Athens	LOCATION	against Lacedaemon ; at the end he quotes with tremendous effectiveness from
Pericles	LOCATION	's eulogy of the dead .

		The underly - ing idea of the second is
Emerson	LOCATION	's distinc - tion between the law for man and the law for things .

		The third essay outlines for the victors the attitude they must take after the war to assure lasting peace .

		The first work ever published by
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, `` The Massacre of the Innocent , '' concludes the vol - ume .

		Written with the aim of reproducing the episodes of a sixteenth century picture in the
Brussels Museum	LOCATION	, it seems now to the author a sort of prophetic vision of tragedies that were to stain with blood many a Belgian village of the twentieth .

		The name of the translator , Mr.
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	, is a guarantee of good work , and the volume is singularly free from the marks of haste that mar so many books whose success seems to depend on immediate publication .

		One notices only an occasional misprint .

		A baffling genius .

		A study of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	in the unpremeditated pages of his copious `` Journal '' must yield a more faithful image of the man than can any amount of reading in his books addressed to the public .

		Not until recently has this trans - cript of the real
Thoreau	PERSON	been open to gen - eral scrutiny , and therefore it is not until this moment that we have had so careful a searching of its pages in quest of his essential qualities as is undertaken by Mr.
Mark van Doren	PERSON	in ``
Henry David Thoreau	PERSON	: A Criti - cal Study '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	,
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		While in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's `` Cape Cod '' and `` Walden '' and other books the file is assiduously used and `` every sentence is the result of a long proba - tion , '' as he himself confesses , in the rambling unconsecutiveness of his diaries there is much both of voluntary and involuntary self - portrayal and self - betrayal ; and in the whole one arrives at some sense of the writer 's temper .

		This is what we desire to know and feel , as Mr.
van Doren	PERSON	says , not the vagaries and paradoxes that he indulges in for effect rather than as the sincere expression of him - self .

		But to put into words this essential quality is only partially possible .

		So far as it could be done , it has been well done by this latest interpreter of an extremely baffling personality .

		As the author says of him , `` if read as scripture , as some of his friends read him , or as madman , as
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	read him , he will yield nothing .

		He can not be taken lit - erally any more than a wild odor can be seized and kept . ''

		If careful study of every avail - able scrap of writing from
Thoreau	PERSON	's prolific pen and an equally thoughtful pondering of most that has been written about him can qualify one to understand and interpret the
Walden	LOCATION	hermit , then Mr.
van Doren	PERSON	should be adjudged a competent critic of
Thoreau	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	at a republic .

		Mr.
Walter Wellman	PERSON	?

		s `` The German Republic '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is a book of curious aspect .

		It is addressed to the German people , `` whom the world has loved and in whom the world still has faith . ''

		It consists of a somewhat fanciful glorification of the German stock and the German achievements , an imaginary `` ad - dress '' of a congress of delegates from the twenty-six German states apologizing abjectly for the errors of the past and craving the for - giveness and future cooperation of the world , a `` declaration of self-government '' adopted by delegates come together to found the Ger - man Republic , and an account of the setting up of the new political regime , not stopping at a touching description of the installation of the dethroned
Kaiser	PERSON	as Prince of
Heligo	LOCATION	- land `` with nominal powers '' and of the gath - ering of half of
Berlin	LOCATION	at the railway station to bid the royal family farewell , the
Kaiser	PERSON	meanwhile being moved to tears by the good will and magnanimity of his former subjects !

		The book was put forward in all seriousness , but the most that can be said for it is that it injects a touch of humor into a grim subject .

		Ao * rce-book of early E '' ^ Professor
Allen R. Benham	PERSON	proves his courage when he introduces his source-book of `` English Literature from
Widsith	LOCATION	to the Death of Chaucer '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- with a quotation from Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		However , this lapse in no way invalidates the scholarly character of the work , which is , as the author points out , a genuine source-book , and not an anthology or a text-book .

		The plan is simple and admirably adequate .

		The text is divided into two sections , `` From the Beginnings to the Norman Conquest '' and `` From the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	to the Death of Chaucer , '' the material in each section being grouped under the following heads : I. , The Political Background ; II. , Social and Indus - trial Background ; III. , The Cultural Back - ground ; IV. , The Linguistic Background ; V. , 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 2	DATE	Literary Characteristics ; and VI. ,
Representa	LOCATION	- tive Authors .

		Those whose interest is pri - marily in the Old English period will wonder at the proportion observed , barely one - third of the book -LRB- 139 pages of the total 613 -RRB- is devoted to the four hundred years before the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	; the rest deals with the three hundred years after the Conquest .

		When it is remembered that the century and a half after the Conquest was almost utterly barren of English activity , the disproportion becomes all the more surprising .

		Examina - tion of the contents shows the reason for this defect .

		The great body of Old English poetry attributed to
Cynewulf	PERSON	and his school is entirely disregarded , while even Beowulf receives scant attention .

		No doubt the author finds less of source-interest in the poetry than in the prose of the early centuries ; yet the reader can not avoid the conclusion that the book lacks balance because the writer 's main interest , and specialized knowledge were in
Middle English	LOCATION	.

		With this exception , the work is all that such a book should be , being faultlessly arranged and wholly trustworthy .

		Its physical make-up is no less satisfactory .

		, .

		Professor
E. N. S. Thompson	PERSON	's Referenceafor - .

		- .

		, .

		Am i i - ` i _ the study of ``
John Milton	PERSON	: A Topical Bib - liography '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a work of much practical value .

		It is not in any sense a complete bibliography , but rather a compilation of selected refer - ences .

		The range of subjects has been deter - mined largely by
Milton	PERSON	's personal interests , but there is also much to direct the reader to authentic information on the many social and political shiftings of seventeenth century
England	LOCATION	.

		Along with the titles of contem - porary documents bearing on a special topic appear references to scholarly works of to-day upon the same subject , so that theoretically at least each group demonstrates the devel - oped opinion of modern scholarship .

		Yet the scholar and bibliophile will find the work only partially useful .

		Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has given no detailed description of early edi - tions , not even the titles of any except those commonly listed .

		Of critical studies , only complete works or distinctly valuable essays find place in the scant hundred pages , for nothing further was contemplated in the com - piler 's plan .

		The British Museum Catalogue oddly omitted here still stands as the best guide for eighteenth century editions , translations , and second-rate writings of the older critics .

		The initiated will grieve over some of the natural results ; for example , they will unhappily note that requirement of space for references on travel , and on the sonnet , elegy , and masque as literary types , shut out edition-titles that prove the Tonsons influential in increasing
Milton	LOCATION	's early repu - tation .

		They will perhaps be disturbed to see arbitrary dating of Elizabethan dramas hith - erto placed only tentatively , or to find
Evelyn	PERSON	and
Pepys	PERSON	dated only by the years of pub - lication of their famous Diaries .

		This sub - ordination of detail is , however , justifiable , for the work is precisely what is professed in the preface `` an adequate outline guide for the study of
Milton	LOCATION	and the period in which he lived . ''

		The variety of topics treated sufficiently demonstrates the author 's knowledge of the period , and the titles included under separate headings represent the careful winnowings of a scholar .

		Like many other expressions in liabilities of the terminology 01
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- ** American jurisprudence , `` civil law '' has several distinct meanings .

		As used in Mr.
Charles Z. Lincoln	PERSON	's book , `` The Civil Law and the Church '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the expression enjoys its broadest meaning and indicates the actual law of the state as con - trasted with the internal regulations of vol - untary societies , especially those important voluntary societies known as churches .

		This well-produced volume of more than one thou - sand pages is not offered as anything other than a practical hand-book for lawyers and judges .

		The great majority of so-called text - books on legal subjects published in recent years are simply digests disguised in the logical form of text-books .

		With commend - able sincerity and wisdom , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	has adopted the traditional form of digests .

		Topics to the number of 145 have been selected and arranged alphabetically , from `` Actions '' to `` Young Men 's
Christian Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Most of these topics are subdivided , the sub - divisions also being arranged alphabetically .

		An Index proves helpful in furthering the accessibility of the contents .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's book is unquestionably the most complete and serviceable guide to modern case-law in Eng - lish-speaking countries affecting the rights and liabilities of religious organizations .

		No fewer than 1650 cases from the appellate courts of the
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Canada	LOCATION	are digested .

		Although this is a law book and reveals a studied effort on the part of the author to be concise , at the same time it contains a surprisingly large amount of history as well as of law .

		The judges of our appellate courts are not supposed to act as historians ; but in deciding the innumerable
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 359 controversies of factious Christianity , these judges have necessarily paid much attention to the history of ecclesiasticism .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's book emphasizes the importance from a purely historical standpoint of our case-law litera - ture .

		, XT is accurately descriptive of `` Na - tionalism , War and Society '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , by Dr.
Edward Krehbiel	PERSON	, Professor of
Modern History	ORGANIZATION	in
Leland Stanford Junior University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact , some of the material is drawn from a syllabus which , with Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	as co-author , Dr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	pub - lished several years ago through the
World Peace Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present volume makes no attempt to present an original study of the questions suggested by its title ; on the con - trary , the author 's plan is to outline all the aspects of the subjects which he thinks ger - mane .

		The result is a full brief , with logical divisions , which can serve as the ground-work for a college course or popular lectures .

		These would come under three main heads : `` Nationalism , Its Character , Fallacies , and Faults ' '' ; `` Modern Political and Social Changes and their Beaction on National Rivalries '' ; and `` Progressive Forces which Seek to Overcome the
Faults of Nationalism	ORGANIZATION	and Establish an Order of Things in Agree - ment with the Evolution of Society . ''

		This latter portion of the volume is the most inter - esting , dealing as it does with the Hague Courts and the various schemes -LRB- such as the programme of the
League to Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- now suggested to keep the nations from resorting to war .

		The volume as a whole , however , is well worth while .

		The lists of peace publications and societies are especially good , and will suffice to introduce the reader to all the accessible literature .


Norman Angell	PERSON	contributes an introduction to Professor
Krehbiel	PERSON	's book , reiterating his well-known thesis as to the dangers of half-preparedness .

		It `` is a pernicious and dangerous fallacy '' that `` our arms are simply for the defence of our soil , for repelling invasion , and that if we only be strong enough , our policy can not endanger us . ''

		On the contrary , in order to preserve the peace , it must be made abun - dantly clear for what purposes our military and naval strength will be used , and `` a suc - cessful American international policy must be the outcome of widely expressed public opinion . ''

		These chapters , though showing the close connection between English and American life , emphasize the fact that from the first there have been divergencies between English institutions as they were maintained and developed in the Old Country , and the similar social elements as transplanted and molded by the environment of a
New World	LOCATION	and the experience it afforded .

		This volume presents the Constitution as a logical whole with the amendments dealt with in connection with the clauses which they alter or supersede .

		`` Br .

		Bacon traces the development of the
United States	LOCATION	plan of government from the earliest Colonial days in an exception - ally interesting manner ... not only is it sound in relation of fact , but so humanly interesting that it will prove a delightful library companion . ''

		`` With nerve and in untrammelled manner ` Q ' declares that the Art of Writing is a Hying business ; that Literature is not a mere Science , to be studied , but an Art , to be practiced ; and easily
Britain	LOCATION	can resign to other nations all the secondary fame to be picked up by commentators , if , with the courage given by native exemplars , her breed persists in striving to write well . ''

		World .

		This volume is compiled for children and not about them .

		Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	has made his collection chiefly one of lyrical verse , because , as he says , `` As an introduction to English Poetry there is no better portal than this . ''

		The volume is indexed by authors and first lines ; the con - tents are classified .

		The rich nature of the recent evidence furnished by discov - eries in
Crete	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Asia Minor	ORGANIZATION	, on the subject of the
Greek House	ORGANIZATION	of the earliest and latest periods , has given fresh impetus to the study .

		The articles on the subject are , however , scattered throughout a host of archaeological periodicals in all languages , many of which are not even accessible to the student .

		407 ART AND THE MORALISTS :
MR. D. H. LAWRENCE	PERSON	'S WORK .

		The instinct of men to moralize their actions , and of society to confine in a the - oretical network of ethical concepts the whole heaving mass of human activities , , is funda - mental .

		The suspicion with which ethics views art exemplified by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's casting of the poets out of the Republic indicates men 's unwillingness to let this framework of moral rules and social conventions -LRB- which bulges obligingly this way and that according | to particular requirements -RRB- be challenged by I aesthetic representations which may invalidate i it Both the Governments and the `` average | citizen '' are never quite easy about the activ - ities of the artists and poets who are likely to be innovating forces .

		Thus a Byron or a
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	may suddenly scatter far and wide , in their poems , the seeds of the French Revo - lution ; or an Ibsen may appear whose `` Doll 's House '' may undermine the bourgeois con - ception of marriage ; or a Tolstoy may arise , whose interpretation of Christian ethics may threaten the structure of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The efforts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	or Society to stamp as `` immoral '' powerful representations of life often as not recoil on the authorities ' heads , as in the ease of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's `` Madame Bovary . ''

		Since the suppression of Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	's novel , `` The Rainbow , '' last year , in unusual circumstances , called forth a weighty testi - monial to its merits from Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, I shall not here comment on the case .

		Certain books excite the ordinary mind unduly , and it was the unseemly scandal made over `` Tess of the D'Urbervilles '' and '' Jude the Obscure '' that brought
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	to lay down his magic wand of fiction .

		In glancing at Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's two volumes of poems , I should like to indicate why his talent is one of the most interesting and uncompromising liter - ary forces of recent years .

		Briefly , he is the poet-psychologist of instincts , emotions , and moods that it is need - less to try and moralize .

		Society 's network of ethical concepts is constantly challenged by the spectacle of our passionate human 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	impulses .

		Take the spectacle of two armies of men struggling to destroy one another .

		Society moralizes their actions by the single word `` patriotism , '' and glorifies slaughter by emphasizing their `` heroic '' virtues .

		But other artists , such as
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Garshin	PERSON	, arise whose pictures of war show us its crimes against Humanity .

		But the more nakedly and vividly does the pure artist of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's type depict the slipping of the leash which holds in the animal impulses , and the more he catches the terror of scenes of carnage , the more does the ordinary man look askance at him .

		Why ?

		Because the artist has torn aside the `` ideal - istic '' veils which conceal the depths of the world of seething passions .

		But should the artist stamp with a terrible beauty the upheaval of these elemental emotions , what then ?

		The moralists will be very wroth with him .

		It is difficult to moralize the beauty of passion and the leaping fire of the senses .

		Accordingly , the moralists try and turn the flank of such an artist by asserting either that his work is without `` high ideals , '' or that the aesthetic representation of such sensations is not art of `` high rank , '' or that it has deleterious effects on the reader .

		But has it deleterious effects on our human conscious - ness ?

		I believe that the true answer to such objectors who are , to-day , legion is that they do both literature and morals a grave disservice by striving to confine aesthetic rep - resentations within too narrow a circle , and that by seeking to fetter and restrain the artist 's activities they cripple art 's function of deepening our consciousness and widening our recognitions .

		If the Eev .


S. P. Howe	PERSON	has his place , so also has
Boccaccio	PERSON	.

		We must not forget that the moralists have always special ends in view , and very little would be left us if they had had their will in every age and could to-day truncate and lop and maim literary and aesthetic classics at their pleasure .

		In your hands aesthetic delineations of the passions would become tame as domestic fowls . ''

		Thus Art would thereby lend itself to the propagation of flat untruth .

		This , indeed , is what frequently happens in literature .

		Eepresentations of life are over-idealized or over-moralized , as the `` heroic '' aspects of War by the lyrical poets ; and another class of artists , the real - ists , have to be called in to redress the balance and paint the terrible , bestial , heart-rending side , which the European nations are expe - riencing to-day .

		And as with War so with Love .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	, by his psychological penetration into Love 's self - regarding im - pulses and passionate moods , supplements our `` idealistic '' valuations of its activities and corrects their exaggeration by conventional - ized sentiment .

		The `` idealistic '' valuations of Love have their high abiding place in lit - erature , unassailable as in life ; but , under cover of their virtual monopoly of our
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	attention , we see the literary field of to-day covered with brooding swarms of sugary , sentimental erotics , artificial in feel - ing , futile and feeble and false as art .

		I am not concerned here to stigmatize these cheap sentimental sweets that cloy and vitiate the public palate , but to point out that their universal propagation coincides with a veiled hostility to the Beautiful , and the con - sequent impoverishment of our spiritual life .

		The harmful effects of the over-development of material progress with its code of utilita - rian standards is shown by the artificial and parasitic position in which poetry and art are thrust in the modern community .

		Our poets and artists are kept , so to say , as a sect of dilettanti , apart , ministering to scholarly aestheticism or drawing-room culture , and are disregarded in the central stir and heat of worldly activities .

		And our spiritual life , bound up and entangled in the wheels and mechanism of our worldly , intellectual , or scientific interests , is conscious of being stunted , of being cheated of its rightful aesthetic enrichment .

		And the general abase - ment of Art in public eyes , its parasitic and artificial status , runs parallel with that pro- gressive aspersion cast on `` the life of the senses , '' that is , of our sensuous perceptions , with the implication that it is somehow or other divisible from our `` spiritual '' life .

		* Which is absurd .

		* In `` A History of American Literature since
1870	DATE	, '' Prof.
F. L. Pattee	PERSON	writes : `` Beauty to
Keats	PERSON	is only that which brings delight to the senses ... he turned in disgust from the
England	LOCATION	about him ... to the world of sensuous delight where selfishly he might swoon away in a dream of beauty . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 379 Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	in his two volumes , `` Love Poems , and Others '' and `` Amores , '' comes to-day to redress the balance .

		As a poet he rehabilitates and sets before us , as a burning lamp , passion * a word which , in the sense of ardent and tumultuous desire , has almost shed to the vulgar mind its original enrooted implication of suffering .

		His love poems celebrate the cry of spirit to flesh and flesh to spirit , the hunger and thrill and tumult of | love 's desires in the whole whirling circle of its impetus from flame to ashes , its swift reaching out to the anguished infinity of warring nature , his love poems , I say , restore to passion the creative rapture that glows in the verse of Keats .

		And his spirit - ual synthesis of passion 's leaping egoism , its revolt against finite ties and limitations , its shuddering sense of inner disharmonies and external revulsions , its winged delight in its own motion , declare its superior intensity of vital energy to the poetry of his English con - temporaries .

		I do not wish to exaggerate the qualities of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's verse .

		His range of mood is very limited , his technique is hasty , his vision turns inward , self-centred ; but in concentration of feeling , in keenness , one might almost say in fierceness of sensation , he seems to issue from those tides of emotional energy which surge in the swaying ocean of life .

		Shall we say that the source of his power is this quivering fire of intensity , which like a leaping flame at night in a garden throws back the darkness in a chiaroscuro of shapes and colors and movements , from the rustling earth to the starlit sky ?

		So the poet 's imagery is steeped in primary emo - tional hues , moods of pity or cruelty , pas - sionate yearning , sorrow , fear , tenderness , aching desire , remorse , anguish .

		This im - agery springs direct from his sensations and is born of his momentary emotional vision , not of his cultivated , imaginative reflections , unlike that of the majority of our talented dilettanti poets .

		It carries with it to a remarkable degree the feeling , the atmos - pheric impression , of nature in the passing moment .

		But we must quote an example : A BABY ASLEEP AFTER PAIN .

		As a drenched , drowned bee Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower , So clings to me My baby , her brown hair brushed with wet tears And laid against her cheek ; Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm , Swinging heavily to my movement as I walk .

		My sleeping baby hangs upon - my lite , Like a burden she hangs on me .

		She has always seemed so light , But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain Even her floating hair sinks heavily , Beaching downwards ; As the wings of a drenched , drowned bee Are a heaviness , and & weariness .

		This , so simple , so spontaneous , and appar - ently effortless , holds all the felicity of the moment in the emotional mood .

		And while psychologically true , the poet 's rendering of a sensuous impression is most spiritual in its appeal .

		But here I must pause , and turn to some consideration of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's work in creative fiction .

		II .

		It was evident to a critical eye that with `` The White Peacock '' -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- a new artistic force was stirring in fiction .

		Curiously , those qualities of `` realism '' and `` naturalism '' both , that had been solemnly exorcised with book , candle , and bell in many professorial admoni - tions , reappeared here in company with intense poetic susceptibility and with an evident delight in the exuberance of nature .

		There was nothing here of
M. Zola	PERSON	's `` false naturalism '' or of his `` scientific reporting '' ; on the contrary , the artist 's fault lay in the unchastened vivacity of his thronging impres - sions and rioting emotions .

		The story , one of country life , traces at length the subtle degen - eration of the young farmer ,
George	PERSON	, who , slow and inexperienced in woman 's ways , takes the wrong girl to wife .

		The book in its frank and unabashed imaginative fecundity and luxuriant coloring , is a baffling one : an extraordinary intimacy with the feminine love instincts is blended with untrammelled psychological interest in the gamut of the passions .

		But a certain over-bold , lush immaturity , a certain sprawling laxity of taste , confused the outlines .

		The youthful artist evidently did not know where to be silent , or how to select and concentrate his scenes .

		These faults were less in evidence in `` The Trespasser '' -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- , the tale of a sensi - tive , frail , and ardent man 's fleeting amour with a girl , superficial and cold in nature , who is dallying with passion .

		The same intense susceptibility to physical impressions , the same vibrating joy in sensuous feelings , were repeated here in a solo on erotic strings .

		The atmosphere is heavy with the odor of meadow - sweet , which is suddenly dissipated by the shock of tragedy .

		Sigismund 's suicide , and 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	the settling down again of his forgetful sub - urban family into the tame stream of its bourgeois commonplaceness , are painted with inflexible sincerity and great psychological acumen .

		An occasional commonness both of language and tone is , however , at variance with the artist 's intensity of perception .

		But Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	silenced his critics by his third novel , `` Sons and Lovers , '' an epic of family life in a colliery district , a piece of social history on a large canvas , painted with a patient thoroughness and bold veracity which both Balzac and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	might have envied .

		The central theme , an unhappy working-class marriage , a woman 's struggle to rear her children while sustained by her strong puri - tanical spirit , develops later into a study of her maternal aversion to surrendering her son to another woman 's arms .

		The theme is dissected in its innermost spiritual fibres with an unflinching and loving exactitude , while the family drama is seen against an impres - sive background of the harsh , driving real - ities of life in a colliery district .

		This novel is really the only one of any breadth of vision in contemporary English fiction that lifts working-class life out of middle-class hands , and restores it to its native atmosphere of hard veracity .

		The mining people , their mental outlook , ways of life , and habits , and the woof of their domestic joys and cares , are contrasted with some country farming types in a neighboring village , where the smoky horizon of industrialism merges , to the pas - sionate eyes of a girl and boy in love , in the magic of quiet woods and pastures .

		The whole treatment is unerringly true and spiritually profound , marred a little by a feeling of pho - tographic accuracy in the narrative and by a lack of restraint in some of the later love scenes .

		The main theme , a life-conflict between husband and wife , is handled again in a tragedy , `` The Widowing of Mrs. Hol - royd '' -LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- , a drama intensely human in its passionate veracity .

		This is a study , intimately observed , of powerful primitive types , first shown with the hot breath of anger in the nostrils , and then with the starkness , pallor , and rigidity of death .

		Contrasted with the puerile frivolity and catchy sensational - ism of the
London	LOCATION	stage , this drama stands like one of
Meunier	PERSON	's impressive figures of Labor amid the marble inanities of a music - hall foyer .

		In his volume of short stories , `` The Prussian Officer '' -LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- , the intensity of the poet-psychologist 's imagination tri - umphs over the most refractory material .

		Again it is the triumph of passion thrilling both flesh and spirit , making the material of life subservient to itself , forcing its way from smoky darkness to light through the eager cells of nature .

		Whether it be the sustained lust of cruelty in the rigid Prussian officer , or the flame of sick misery leaping to revenge in the heart of the young Bavarian orderly ; or the cruel suspense and agony of pain in the mutual confession of love of the young miner and the vicar 's daughter ; or the bitterness of ironic regret of the lovers who have fallen asunder in `` The Shades of Spring '' ; or hate and suffering in a wife 's reckless confession of her past in `` Shadow in the Rose Garden '' ; in each of the dozen tales it is the same poetic realization of pas - sion 's smouldering force , of its fusion of aching pleasure and pain in the roots of sexual life , the same twinness of senses and soul in the gathering and the breaking waves of surging emotion .

		And here is the secret of the individual quality and the definite limitations of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's vision .

		Like a tree on a hot sum - mer noon , his art casts a sharp , fore-shortened shadow .

		His characters do not pass far out - side that enchanted circle of passion in and round which they move .

		That this circle is narrow compared with the literary field , say , of a Maupassant , is I think due to Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's poetical intensity restricting his psychological insight .

		And his emotional intensity , again , is indissolubly one with his sensuous impressionability .

		And here we may pick up again the dropped thread of our opening remarks about the suspicion with which the moralists always view art .

		The attack on the literature of passions -LRB- and indirectly on sensuous beauty itself which feeds the passions -RRB- is generally conducted on the line of argument that such literature is in opposition to the `` higher and more spiritual '' instincts of mankind .

		The reply is that each specimen of such literature can only be judged according to the relation and the equilibrium , established by the artist , between the morality of nature and the morality of man .

		In the love life the struggle is endless between the fundamental instinct of sexual attraction and the narrowing instincts of worldly prudence and family and social duty .

		In seeking to cripple or suppress the litera -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 ture of the passions , the moralists are tipping up the `` idealistic '' scale unduly to the detri - ment of the fundamental human instincts ; and this reacts injuriously , just as does the ascetic vilification of the `` body , '' on the spiritual life .

		The greater the triumph of materialism and industrial squalor in our commercialized society , the more contempt is poured on the `` world of sensuous delight '' and the less regard paid to Art , Poetry , and testhetie Beauty .

		So
Keats	PERSON	is indicted , as we have seen , of `` selfishly swooning away in a dream of beauty '' !

		And whom would the moralists who cut off the truthful delineation of the passions on the ground that such leads to sensuous indulgence , whom would the moralists put in
Keats	PERSON	's place ?

		This is what we ask also in the case of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's work , which , as I have said , restores to `` pas - sion '' shades of its original meaning of suffer - ing .

		His lovers are not those bright young people of the popular novel whose idea of love seems to be inseparably connected with success and worldly prosperity and having a nice house and being envied by their neigh - bors .

		His lovers are shaken , they suffer ; to them is revealed the significance of things : they have to pass through much and endure much in attaining or missing their passionate desire .

		Theirs are spiritual experiences , not merely `` sensuous gratification , '' as the moral - ists so glibly phrase it .

		And therefore Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's representation of the sensuous and animal strands and instincts in our nature needs , I say , no moralization .

		These elements exist , they are , in a sense , the foundation on which our moral being has been slowly reared ; and the artist who can draw -LRB- and few there are who can -RRB- a truth - ful representation of our passionate impulses , kept under or leaping into action , takes an indispensable place in literature .

		In the liter - ature that explores the relations between the morality of nature , as expressed in the activ - ity of sexual feeling and worldly conduct , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's fiction takes a high place .

		His story , `` Daughters of the Vicar , '' is an admir - able analysis of the frequent clash between the two ; and the sketches called `` Second Best '' and `` Shadow in the Rose Garden '' reestablish the necessary equilibrium so fla - grantly disturbed by the moralists in their exaltation of the `` idealistic '' scale .

		Such studies , to which one may add `` The Christen - ing '' and `` The White Stocking , '' at best I make an appeal to our fundamental conscious - ness that `` the good '' as conceived by the moralists confines to too narrow a circle our tides of emotional energies ; and this vindi - cation of `` passion '' in these stories appears to take its rise in the instinct for racial health .

		But I have said enough on this head , and will only add that those who challenge the right to existence of such works of art would pene - trate to their vulnerable side if they left the road of `` morals '' and took the path of `` taste . ''

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	, -LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Much is being said in
Europe	LOCATION	about a pro- posed `` War after the War , '' an attempt by the Allies , if they are victorious , to prevent a repetition of the ante-bellum commercial invasion by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Along this same line , but in a much less reprehensible spirit , is the suggested organized effort on the part of the French intellectuals to combat Teutonic influence , or rather to spread Latin influence , by a better equipment of the French publish - ing world .

		This is the aim of the recently founded
Comite du Livre	ORGANIZATION	.

		The father of the idea seems to have been the late
Gaston Maspero	PERSON	, the distinguished French Egyptol - ogist , who declared that what he had in view was `` to uphold the prestige of French thought , especially abroad . ''

		It is also intended to establish similar committees in foreign countries * and thus to form `` an intellectual federation destined to oppose everywhere German preponderance . ''

		A special effort is to be made to win the support of the
United States	LOCATION	, `` which has shown by the sacrifice of its time , money , and even the life of its citizens , a warm sympathy for our country . ''

		Another object of the committee is to open at
Paris	LOCATION	a `` Museum of Books and French Thought , '' where , among other things , , will be given series of lectures and prizes for creditable publications .

		Of prime impor - tance will be `` the diffusion in foreign parts , particularly among the Anglo-Saxon nations , of French musical editions destined to sup - plant German editions . ''

		This is a blow direct at Leipsic .

		Another effort will be centred in the drawing up of bibliographies `` devoted to
France	LOCATION	alone and which will give the titles of the best books on sale in all branches of literature . ''

		In this connection , Professor
Maurice Croiset	PERSON	, President of the College of
France	LOCATION	, and a prominent member 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	of the Comite du Livre , remarks : '' It is deplorable that to-day when one wants cer - tain ancient or modern authors , you are forced to turn to foreign editions of them . ''

		The committee intends also to issue annually three special catalogues , one devoted to children 's books , one to works for scholars and students , and a third , which should be particularly excellent , being French , and for which has been chosen this happy old 18th century title , `` Bibliotheque de 1 ` Homme de Gout . ''

		The future Museum will be both retro - spective and contemporary .

		In fact , such a Museum was proposed in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1894	DATE	, when the papers took up the suggestion and a com - mittee was appointed to carry it out .

		But that was as far as the project went in
France	LOCATION	.

		The wide-awake Germans , however , immedi - ately took in hand what the French had abandoned , and five years later Leipsic car - ried it out on a grand scale .

		Commenting thereon , the promoters of the present project ask : `` If
Germany	LOCATION	has her Gutenberg , and
Belgium	LOCATION	her
Plantin	PERSON	, should not
France	LOCATION	, and especially
Paris	LOCATION	, be proud of their Etiennes , their Didots , and all their other book glories ? ''

		Another work of the
Comite du Livre	ORGANIZATION	is to be the drawing up of a catalogue of all French books suited for foreign parts , `` espe - cially for the public of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		It should be noted , by the way , how often and in what a friendly spirit our country is men - tioned in all these preliminary documents concerning this whole project .

		It appears that more than 3000 titles are already listed , and this catalogue will eventually include `` all the modern books on sale by French pub - lishers . ''

		In addition , as I have already said , special catalogues are contemplated `` in order to combat efficaciously the immense adver - tisement made of the intellectual production of
Germany	LOCATION	by the 30,000 catalogues distrib - uted free each year among the book-sellers of the two hemispheres by the aid of the grand commission houses of Leipsic . ''

		But the most important immediate labor of the committee has been the organization of a Book
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, about which
M. Jacques de Dampierre	ORGANIZATION	, the learned paleographic archi - vist , the general secretary of the committee , wrote me as follows
last summer	DATE	: The meeting which we held
last April	DATE	at
Lyons	PERSON	should not be given the grand name of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as was done by the newspapers , for it was simply a preparation for the real
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which will be held this coming fall at
Paris	LOCATION	, and the arrangements for which are now being made by a special committee of six members , two from our Comite du Livre , two from the Society of Men of Letters , and two from the
Paris	LOCATION	Publishers ' Club .

		We shall not aim to make it an international gathering but shall confine our attention exclusively to our French publishers .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	already promises to be a marked suc - cess .

		America has done so much for us in our present difficulties that I hesitate to call the atten - tion of some of your rich fellow countrymen to this purely French intellectual enterprise .

		But if any Americans should wish to sub - scribe to the expenses of the undertaking , the address of
M. de Dampierre	ORGANIZATION	and the Com - mittee 's office is 101
Rue du Bac	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This
Comite du Livre	ORGANIZATION	is not the only instance of the intellectual side of
France	LOCATION	coming prominently to the fore in the midst of her dire calamities .

		Perhaps a still more characteristic example of this is the discus - sion that has been going on all over the coun - try , both in the newspapers and in the drawing-rooms , concerning the elision or the non-elision of the first a in the title of
M. Pierre Loti	PERSON	's latest book .

		`` La Hyene Enragee '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Calmann-Levy , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , an English edition of which has been arranged for , is made up of a number of articles on various episodes of the war , which articles first appeared in different
Paris	LOCATION	journals .

		But perhaps it may be said that the most interesting thing about this book is the phonetic discussion which it has provoked , and which is well set forth and perhaps set - tled in the following extract from a letter which I have received from Professor
Paul Passy	PERSON	, one of the best authorities in
France	LOCATION	on these questions and known for a `` Phonetic Dictionary , '' published , let it be noted in passing , in
Germany	LOCATION	, `` so that I can not get a copy for you '' : About la hyene and I ` hyene a great deal of rub - bish has been written .

		It is really not at all a mat - ter of aspirated or non-aspirated h .

		It is simply that initial y or i before a vowel is often treated as a consonant , and , so far as I can observe , tends to be treated so more and more ; so that there is neither liaison nor elision before it .

		In well-estab - lished commonly-used words , such as yeux , the old usage prevails , and everybody pronounces the s of les in les yeux .

		But in comparatively new or rare words the tendency is to treat y as a consonant : la yole , le yak , le yacht .

		In these words the spelling may have had some influence .

		But a more char - acteristic word is iode .

		Formerly I used always to hear de I ` iode ; now I often hear du iode .

		The case of initial w or ou before a vowel is exactly parallel ; la ouate tends to supplant I ` ouate .

		In the case of hyene , the acting of this general tendency is probably reinforced by the spelling .

		As a matter of fact , although one generally reads I ` hyene in books , I have always or almost always heard la hyene .

		It cer - tainly is the common pronunciation .

		I can only praise
Pierre Loti	PERSON	for having given it a literary consecration .

		In this connection perhaps I may call atten - tion to a clever little poem , `` Licence Poetique , '' which turns on the aspiration or the non-aspiration of the h , and is published in
Paul Fort	LOCATION	's new volume , `` Deux Chau -
1916	DATE	-RSB- 383 inieres '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Monnier	PERSON	, 2 frs . -RRB-

		.

		This work forms the eighteenth volume of his `` Ballades Franchises , '' but does not seem attuned exactly to the spirit of the moment .

		The explanation , however , is given on the next to the last page , where we read : `` This book was stopped here by the war . ''

		But at present it is not the writers of established reputation who are the favorites of the publishers and the public .

		The academicians have given way to the soldier - authors , and the books which come from the trenches are more popular than those which come from the study .

		Thus , `` Sous
Verdun	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- is a first book which , however , is now in its twelfth edition .

		When the war broke out , the author of this book was a second-year student at the
Paris Superior Normal School	ORGANIZATION	, the great nursery of French university professors , and had just finished a study of Maupassant , which is still in manuscript .

		The young soldier remained at the front until the
end of April of last year	DATE	, when he received three wounds , one of which was so serious that his left hand was paralyzed , and he is now working in the
Paris	LOCATION	office of the
Fatherless Children of France	ORGANIZATION	.

		He informs me that he expects soon to pub - lish a continuation of this volume , which is in many respects one of the best war books I have seen and the first of its kind , so far as I know , which has been troubled by the mil - itary censor .

		Passages have been suppressed in the middle of paragraphs , and here and there whole pages are in white .

		The explana - tion is that the narrative covers the opera - tions around
Verdun	LOCATION	at the very beginning of the war , and the book appeared in the midst of the unsuccessful attempts of the Germans to take the fortress .

		It was evi - dently feared that the mention of certain names of persons and places , and certain statements , might aid the enemy .

		These blanks are at times somewhat irritating , though they do add an interest to the book by piquing the curiosity .

		`` Lettres d'un Soldat '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Chapelot , 2 frs . -RRB-

		is also to be recommended to those who are reading French war literature .

		It is the tenderest book I have read .

		We have here a small collection of letters from a young painter who has `` disappeared , '' an euphe - mism for one who is buried in an unknown grave or who has been burned in the lugubri - ous cremations which follow most of these awful battles now in progress .

		These letters , sent almost daily to a deeply beloved mother , are of a beautifully gentle nature and are a terrible arraignment of a civilization which forces such a delicate poetic character as was this youth to participate in the horrible war - fare of the western front .

		Even the most stoical can not read , without tears welling to the eyes , these notes addressed to `` my dear - est mama , '' or `` cherished mother , '' or `` very dear loved mother , '' or `` dear , dearest mother , '' and written `` from a cattle car , '' or `` in the dark , '' or on `` the fifth day in the first line , '' or `` in the morning sunshine , '' or `` in the midst of the battle , '' or `` in the peace of the sabbath . ''

		And the little book closes with this , the last note ever received from the writer : `` Dear mother so dear : Here we are at noon at the extreme point of attack .

		I send thee my whole love .

		Whatever hap - pens , life has had beauty for me . ''

		The pain - ful mystery surrounding this volume is increased by this note from the publisher in sending it to me : `` I can not give you the name of this lad , his family not wishing to reveal his identity so long as there remains a hope that he may be a prisoner of war in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		The beautifully written book of the Abbe
Felix Klein	PERSON	, `` Les Douleurs qui Esperent '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Perrin	LOCATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , should be read after the foregoing , as it is a sort of spiritual sequence thereto .

		It is dedicated `` to those who weep , to those who doubt , '' and is divided into two parts .

		The first part relates some of the tragic or pathetic episodes which have come under the prelate 's eyes in the American Ambulance , the military surgical hospital near
Paris	LOCATION	, where he has served as chaplain ever since the opening of the war .

		The second part is entitled `` Reflections , '' and consists of noble and comforting homilies addressed to just such heart-broken mothers as the one revealed in `` Les Lettres d'un Soldat . ''

		It was my privilege to serve for some fifteen months in the same wards with
Abbe Klein	PERSON	, and I see his whole fine char - acter stand forth in the pages of this sad but fascinating book .

		I close this little list of war books with a few words about a really remarkable novel , `` Inferno '' -LRB-
Basel	LOCATION	: Frobenius , 5 frs .

		50 -RRB- , which has already been translated or is being translated into all the chief modern lan - guages .

		Its author , Dr.
Edward Stilgebauer	PERSON	, is a German subject who has had to flee his country and bring out his book in German , in
Switzerland	LOCATION	because he can not accept the ways and methods of
Prussianized Germany	LOCATION	.

		The tale is indeed a scathing exposure of the evils of Teutonic militarism ; and if the book finally gets into the hands of the German people , it should do much toward ending the war and ending it in the right manner .

		In a more general way , `` Inferno '' is a pow - 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	erful attack on the atrocities of war , and is sure to promote the cause of true inter - nationalism .

		`` Can you not find a great American cinematograph company which will take up my novel ? ''

		Dr.
Stilgebauer	PERSON	writes me .

		I wish I could , for I am convinced that its wide presentation would do much for the world 's happiness .

November 1 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		MARK TWAIN 'S VITALITY emphasized itself in his famous utterance upon the premature report of his death .

		Whether even now the prevailing impression of his having ceased to contribute to our humorous literature may not have an element of exaggeration , is a query that arises on reading of his alleged performances with the Ouija-board in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where that diverting toy has of late been playing some remarkable pranks .

		Per - haps it is a jest not wholly unworthy of
Mark Twain	PERSON	himself , but we are asked to believe that he is writing a posthumous novel , ``
Jap Herron	PERSON	, '' and that a young woman , discreetly left unnamed , is acting as his amanuensis , with the aforementioned mechanical device as the inanimate medium of communication .

		At first the dictation was interrupted by interjected complaints of the lack of punctua - tion marks on the Ouija-board .

		Something like this , `` Jap
Herron	PERSON	awoke where 's that comma early the next morning , '' would be the bewildering beginning of a sentence , until the meaning of these seeming irrelevancies was discovered and a supply of punctuation marks painted on the board , after which the narrative flowed more smoothly .

		But even then an apostrophe perilously near the edge of the board caused discomfort to the unseen author , who took occasion to remark , in char - acteristic fashion , after using this symbol , `` I 'm afraid of slipping off and going over - board every time I go after that thing . ''

		Accordingly it was erased and painted in at a safe distance from the edge .

		`` That 's better , '' was the approving comment the next time it was used .

		This excellent fooling , if it be no more , recalls the humorist 's amusing first attempt to use the typewriter in the early days of that machine .

		His typewritten letter -LRB- to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, if memory serves -RRB- is quoted , with its characteristic interpolations of more or less abusive comment on the new device , in the biography of
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		The similarity of mood and utterance in the veritable inci - dent to the temper and its expression in the perhaps apocryphal occurrence is striking .

		THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN DRAMA are not so well known but that interest will be aroused in an exhibition arranged by the
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	and the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	for the three months from
November 1	DATE	to
February 1	DATE	, held in the main exhibition room of the Central Build - ing .

		As an introduction to this event the `` Branch Library News '' publishes a sketch of the rise and growth of our drama by Mr.
E. J. Streubel	PERSON	, who begins by pointing out the neglect that this subject has until recently suffered , and the consequent ignorance in regard to it that prevails .

		`` In fact , '' he says , `` it was only in the
last decade	DATE	that collectors and scholars have brought partial order out of chaos , and have revealed to the American public that we have a valuable storehouse of dramatic literature .

		The quest for first edi - tions of these plays is still going on .

		Many have been found in isolated form , but of others the very existence is doubted .

		Thus we have just one copy of our first printed Amer - ican play , ` Androboros ' -LRB- 1714 -RRB- , by Governor Hunter .

		Likewise , the famous prize play of
John Augustus Stone	PERSON	, '
Metamora	LOCATION	' -LRB- 1829 -RRB- , in which
Edwin Forrest	PERSON	, the renowned tragedian and interpreter of Indian char - acter , starred for many years , is known to us only through records in dramatic publica - tions , and through a few lines of dialogue in manuscript form , retained in the home of Forrest in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. ''

		Nevertheless , in the face of the difficulties attending such a task , four notable collections of early Amer - ican drama have been made , the
Harris Collection	ORGANIZATION	at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, the
Clothier Collection	ORGANIZATION	at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, the
New York Public Library Collection	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Atkinson Collection	ORGANIZATION	.

		To these and other details of interest Mr.
Streubel	PERSON	's article , illus - trated with two old woodcuts , is devoted .

		It is announced in this connection that one of the
New York	LOCATION	theatres , which is not named , has planned a series of revivals of old American plays .

		AN EVENTFUL .

		SEASON FOR COLLECTORS in this country , especially for those whose hobby is book-collecting , is now opening .

		For reasons only too sadly obvious , European treasures in the department of antiquities of all sorts now tend more than ever to find their way to our prosperous markets .

		There will be no despoiling of the Old World , but indulgence in collecting can not there go to the same length as in the piping times of peace .

		Among the notable sales of the season at the great auction houses of
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, a few are especially
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 385 worthy of mention .

		The famous print col - ' lection of Mr.
Frederick R. Halsey	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	is to be sold at the
Anderson Galleries	PERSON	, and there also the late
A. M. Palmer	PERSON	's collec - tion of playbills and old prints and other matter relating - to actors and acting is offered - to the public .

		Mr.
John D. Crimmins	PERSON	's rare books and prints pertaining to early
New j York	LOCATION	history are changing hands , and the collection of the late
William Matthews	PERSON	, known to lovers of fine bindings , will be dis - persed .

		The library of the late
John Barnard Pearse	PERSON	of
Roxbury	LOCATION	also ends its collective existence .

		Among the separate items solicit - -LSB- ing attention at the various auction houses , j few are more attractive than the original edition of `` Vanity Fair '' to be sold at the
Walpole Galleries	LOCATION	.

		This book , in the original parts , with the original wrappers and the original drawings , all in excellent preserva - tion , is an exceeding rarity ; and this is said to be the best of the few extant copies .

		.

		Another rarity , or rather `` uniquity , '' of the season is that little manuscript book of poems executed in the minute hand of its author and thus lettered by her on its title-page : `` A Book of Rhymes , By
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sold by
Nobody	ORGANIZATION	.

		And Printed by
Herself	ORGANIZATION	.


Haworth	PERSON	,
Dec. 17 , 1829	DATE	Anno Domino . ''

		It is in its old brown paper covers , which the little
Charlotte	LOCATION	herself sewed and lettered .

		CASH PRIZES FOR LITERARY WORK are a potent stimulus to the attainment of excel - J lence , though not exactly the highest incen - j tive to effort .

		Honesty would compel most i writers to admit that it is not a pure devo - tion to literary art that keeps them at their task .

		The late
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	was once asked whether he held before himself , as end j and ideal , the production of works of litera - i ture that would live after his death .

		His j reply was that his chief purpose was to pro- i duce books that would enable him to live j until his death .

		With a motive probably j somewhat similar , though more altruistic , the ; late founder of the
Columbia School of Jour	ORGANIZATION	- nalism established a number of liberal prizes !

		for literary excellence , not in journalism i alone but in fiction , biography , history , and play-writing .

		Nine such prizes are announced by the school for the current year ; they are to be awarded as follows : `` For the best example of a reporter 's work ,
$ 1000	MONEY	, the test being accuracy , terseness , and the accomplish - ment of some public good .

		For the best editorial ,
$ 500	MONEY	, the test being clearness , moral purpose , sound reasoning , and power to influ - ence public opinion in the right direction .

		For any one idea that will promise improve - ment in the School of Journalism , or for the best paper on the future development of the school ,
$ 1000	MONEY	.

		For the best history of the services rendered by the American press dur - ing the preceding year ,
$ 1000	MONEY	, and a
$ 500	MONEY	gold medal for the most disinterested and meri - torious public service rendered by any Amer - ican newspaper .

		For the best book of the year on
United States	LOCATION	history ,
$ 2000	MONEY	, and
$ 1000	MONEY	each for the best American biography , novel , and play . ''

		Also five travelling fel - lowships of
$ 1500	MONEY	each are to be awarded , three to graduates of the school , one to an art student recommended by the
National Academy of Design	ORGANIZATION	, and one `` to that student of music in
America	LOCATION	who may be deemed the most talented and deserving . ''

		Further infor - mation will be given by the Secretary of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		FRENCH ACADEMY VACANCIES , like so many other vacancies in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- and elsewhere , too , for that matter -RRB- tell a sad tale of the ravages of war .

		No fewer than seven empty chairs are now waiting to be filled .

		Within little more than two years the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	has lost
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	, the
Comte de Mun	ORGANIZATION	,
Jean Frangois Mezieres	PERSON	,
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	,
Francois Charmes	PERSON	,
Emile Faguet	PERSON	, and the
Marquis de Segur	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course there is no lack of candi - dates for these vacancies , despite the deple - tion in the ranks of the best and noblest of the sons of
France	LOCATION	.

		M.
Arthur Meyer	PERSON	, direc - tor of the royalist journal , `` Le Gaulois , '' says that the candidates ' names are known , though he refrains from gratifying curiosity as to the bearers of these names and ventures no prediction concerning the ultimate choice that will be made from among them .

		But he does say : `` I shall be astonished if there are not seats reserved for the generals that shall have won the expected victory , and for the states - men that shall have prepared that victory . ''

		He also makes it clear , without giving names , that he favors the election of
M. Briand	PERSON	for one of the vacant chairs .

		That a royalist of the influence and prominence of this royalist editor should propose for the Academy one who has so plainly manifested his anti- monarchical and even socialistic views , is something that would have been a wild impossibility before the war .

		VITAL STATISTICS OF PERIODICALS , like those of human beings , show a high rate of mor - tality among the new-born .

		A certain impe - tus or momentum or sturdiness must in both instances be gained before the infant 's future 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	can become in any degree assured .

		But how is this to be acquired by the beginning mag - azine ?

		Popular support follows readily enough upon demonstrated success , but to win success popular support is precisely the thing needed .

		Thus the new magazine 's case is much like that of the ambitious young author , who , in order to secure a publisher , must first have a successful book or two to his credit ; but to gain this start he must first find a pub - lisher .

		And so both he and the new magazine are caught in the inescapable vicious circle , or so it has seemed more times than a few .

		Last year there were 247 births in the period - ical world , and 196 deaths , some of these lat - ter being of that form of disguised decease witnessed in the merging of one publication into another of tougher fibre .

		The `` Book Bulletin '' of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	touches on the difficulties of selecting its periodicals for the coming year , especially in the choice of new ones from the consider - able number soliciting favor .

		These new selections must `` represent a reasonably important phase of public interest '' and also `` show promise of enough vitality to survive at least during the period contracted for . ''

		Among the latest arrivals are `` The Russian Review , '' and ``
Russia	LOCATION	, '' and `` The South American , '' all timely and promising .


Avia	ORGANIZATION	- tion has several new `` organs , '' one devoted almost entirely to military aircraft .

		Proof - reading is the subject of another new period - ical , Japanese drama of still another , while the janitorial care of large buildings now has its special representative in the parliament of periodical print , and even so little inviting a theme as the new taste in cemetery art is not unrepresented .

		In fact , it would be diffi - cult to name any department of human inter - est or activity that has not , somewhere in the world , a periodical publication devoted to it .

		VOCATIONS OF THE LIBERALLY EDUCATED , that is , of those who have had a university training , are surprisingly varied .

		Not the least of the university 's functions seems to be to awaken a student to the harsh fact that he is not qualified to shine in any of the so - called learned professions , and that his ener - gies may best be spent in some pursuit not too severely intellectual .

		Of the thirty thou - sand or more persons who have enjoyed the benefit of study at one of our largest state universities -LRB- that of
Illinois	LOCATION	-RRB- there are now found to be 813 who are lawyers , 347 who practise medicine , and 83 who preach the gospel .

		In other words , the three learned professions , long accepted as preeminently such , have claimed about three per cent of these liberally educated persons .

		But of course this proportion becomes considerably larger when we add those engaged in such other intellectual activities as teaching , library work , writing , scientific research , and so on .

		At the end of the list are found such followers of miscellaneous professions as baseball players , dieticians , barbers , brokers , floriculturists , foresters ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	healers , postmasters , advertisers , nurses , mis - sion workers , soldiers , and sailors .

		One woman is a professional circus rider .

		These interesting facts , with others no less so , are set forth in orderly array by Mr.
Vergil V. Phelps	PERSON	in a Directory that he has compiled of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		A brief synopsis of the work appears in `` School and Society '' for
Aug. 5 , 1916	DATE	.

		LIBRARIES IN WAR-TIME are not the least of the sufferers from the madness of a world torn with strife .

		Every librarian has to report more or less interruption to normal activities as a result of the clash .

		Typical of the situation everywhere in the library world is the condition described in the following from a late Report of the
Williams Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege Library .

		It will be read with sympathy by members of the profession .

		`` The effect of the European War has been to check to a certain degree orders for foreign importa - tions .

		There are occasional long delays ; bind - ing is turned out slowly owing to a scarcity of labor ; and freight shipments , particularly from
Germany	LOCATION	, have been unsafe .

		Three months must be allowed for German orders , two months for French .

		Periodicals come through by mail with a fair degree of prompt - ness .

		Of the magazines , four German , four French , and one Spanish have temporarily suspended publication because of the war . ''

		The large libraries of the great cities are , of course , much harder hit than this compara - tively small institution .

		* WHERE TERSENESS COUNTS , and where the lack of it most often makes the judicious grieve , is in the inscription on a public monu - ment .

		Austere simplicity , the brevity of the epigram without its too frequent flippancy , is here in place , whereas turgidity and an excess of comparatively unimportant detail are commonly the inscription 's chief char - acteristics .

		An ancient legend it is almost too good to be history tells of a slab of stone marking the utmost limit of
Alexander	PERSON	's invasion of
India	LOCATION	; and on the stone he had
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 387 caused to be engraved the words , `` Here I stood . ''

		What could better have perpetuated his name and fame than that brief testimony to the might of his arms ?

		Among latter-day writers of inscriptions the eminent ex-presi - dent of
Harvard	LOCATION	, as is well known , has shown himself a master of the pithy phrase .

		The
Shaw Monument on Beacon Hill	ORGANIZATION	offers a fine example of brevity , force , and grace in its inscription .

		It might have been with this in mind , though it is very unlikely that it was , that Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	wrote his plea in a recent `` Cornhill '' for an appropriate memorial to the thousands of brave English - men who have lately given , and are still giving , their lives for their country .

		Not one monument alone , however elaborate and beau - tiful and costly , would he have , but a great number of simple and yet impressive reminders of the heroic dead in various places ; and each should have its fitting inscription combining deep feeling with austere brevity of expression .

		BROWNING IN INTIMATE INTERCOURSE did not make one invariable impression on all his friends .

		Some have described him as not in the least a poet in his manner and con - versation , but rather a man of fashion and devoted to the pleasures of polite society .

		Others saw in him only the poet , or at most the poet and the lover .

		Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	declares that ``
Browning	PERSON	's whole life was divided equally between two things : love and art , '' and in the same article from which we quote these words -LRB- see `` The North American Be view '' for
October	DATE	-RRB- the writer gives some intimate reminiscences of the poet .

		It is note - worthy that whereas Lord Redesdale has very lately described
Browning	PERSON	's voice as harsh and even strident , extremely disagreeable to the ear , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, though admitting an unmistakable `` violence of voice '' in him , nevertheless adds : `` It had the whole gamut of music , it vibrated , it thrilled me , by certain touches of rare magic in it . ''

		Notable also , in another respect , is this passage : `` Then he spoke of a letter he had just had from
Tennyson	LOCATION	: ` it was something sacred , he would not on any account that it got into the news - papers ; even the fact that he had it ; he could not show it to us , it was too sacred . ' '

		After all , though
Browning	PERSON	was the last man to pose as a poet , it must have been the blind - ness of observers that failed to see in him what we , at a distance , see in his poems ; for no man can , year in and year out , act out of his character .

		PROBLEMS OF
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	is doing a very considerable work in reprinting the col - lected papers and speeches of Mr.
Elihu Root	PERSON	.

		The present volume , which is only one of several , contains much matter of permanent political importance .

		Quite apart from the immense political experience Mr.
Root	PERSON	has enjoyed , his is one of the ablest and most incisive minds in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He has seen at first hand the process of govern - ment , and he has speculated upon the prob - lems of its mechanism with a profundity that is unfortunately too rare in American life .

		The inference from his experience is a precious gift .

		Mr.
Root	PERSON	speaks from the standpoint of an individualist of the eighties , and much of what he writes must perhaps be checked by the changed conditions of our time .

		Yet he has a real and vivid appreciation of the busi - ness of government .

		He emphasizes its impor - tance in the civic life of to-day .

		He realizes that it is impossible to regard it with anything like the externality of temper so characteristic of the past generation .

		He is not perhaps very easy in his mind at the speed with which its functions are being extended .

		He feels that there is a certain incompetency almost inher - ent in so wide a democracy as ours of the diminution of which he is not a little skepti - cal .

		He utters a brief but pregnant warning against the now popular attempt to force a transition from representative government to direct government .

		But he has admirable ground for his fears .

		`` The experience of popular government , '' he writes , `` has already made it plain that the art of self-government does not come to men by nature . ''

		That is a lesson the American people have not found it easy to learn .

		We have inherited from
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	the belief in a somewhat facile equalitarianism , and we find it difficult to believe that the slow and painful process of contact with events does , as a fact , confer a special fitness upon special men .

		Yet any - one who doubts the truth of this attitude has only to read the speeches of Mr.
Root	PERSON	at the
New York Constitutional Convention	ORGANIZATION	of
1915	DATE	to be convinced to the contrary .

		He will be impressed not only at the easy mastery of the processes of democracy which Mr. Root invar - iably evinced , but also , as in the famous speech on `` invisible government , '' at the * ADDRESSES ON GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENSHIP .

Elihu 388 THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
November 16	DATE	shrewdness which penetrates below the sur - face of deceptive mechanisms to the realities of human manipulation .

		He will become con - vinced that democracy depends for its success very largely on the brains and character of individuals .

		He will understand , as Mr.
Root	PERSON	so continually emphasizes , that the business of democracy consists for the most part in the ability to get the right men in office , and the courage to keep them there .

		It is not easy to persuade the mass of men to concern themselves so far with politics as to see to it that this is done .

		The majority , as Mr.
Boot	PERSON	points out , `` is willing to pursue a course which , if shared in by the rest of their countrymen , would bring our constitutional government to an immediate end . ''

		Half the problem of democratic government is to make its problems intelligently jind arrestingly interesting to the man in the street .

		The reader of Mr.
Boot	PERSON	's volume will be impressed again and again by the skill with which a great problem that of reform in legal pro- cedure , for example , or of the place of law - yers in the modern state is broadly and vividly sketched , so that in a brief space the logical outlines of Mr.
Koot	PERSON	's attitude are made to appear .

		The few short pages on the recall of judges -LRB- pp. 387-410 -RRB- , for instance , are on the whole the best single statement with which I am acquainted of the case against a periodic renewal of tenure .

		This only means , indeed , that Mr.
Root	PERSON	is a great advocate , and that he has the lawyer 's faculty of going straight to the heart of his subject .

		But it means also that he has devoted a rich and critical mind to the analysis of great public questions , and the result of his specu - lation is bound to affect our judgment of the issues he has discussed .

		If I had to single out the most important contribution of the book to our present situa - tion it would undoubtedly be the speeches in which Mr. Root deals -LRB- pp. 363-78 -RRB- with the function of the States in the national life .

		He there expounds admirably not only the broad case for federal regulation , but also the reasons why it is simply essential that the individuality of the forty-eight local govern - ments must be preserved .

		There is a law of diminishing returns at work in the area of administration , and it may be seriously ques - tioned whether the point of saturation has not in fact been reached .

		`` This country is too great , '' Mr.
Root	PERSON	has said , `` its population too numerous , its interests too vast and com - plicated already , to say nothing of the enormous increases that we can see before us in the future , to be governed as to the great range of our daily affairs from one central power in
Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		That is a significant warning .

		It suggests that the great adminis - trative problem which lies ahead of us is the effective mobilization of local resources .

		There is a real danger lest we should fail to learn the lesson to be gleaned from the over-cen - tralization of
France	LOCATION	and the decaying inten - sity of parish-life in
England	LOCATION	.

		Rightly used , the States can be made the real salvation for the burden of administrative abundance .

		There are some things in this book that one regrets .

		Where Mr.
Root	PERSON	passes from the problems of government to the problems of economics , for instance , he is invariably less fruitful in suggestion , and less happy in expression .

		It is simply uncreative , to take the most striking example , to view the world - process of to-day as a contest between Social - ism and Individualism .

		It is a little too simple to justify rights of property by tying them up to individual liberty .

		But , when the last criticism has been made , this is an important and stimulating volume , for which we have cause to be grateful .

		It comes at a difficult and therefore at an oppor - tune time .

		`` The whole business of govern - ment , '' Mr.
Root	PERSON	told the
New York Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	in the present year , `` is becoming serious , grave , threatening .

		No man in
America	LOCATION	has any right to rest contented and easy and indifferent ; for never before , not even in the time of the Civil War , have all the energies and all the devotion of the American Democracy been -LSB- so -RSB- demanded for the per - petuity of American institutions . ''

		It is because Mr.
Root	PERSON	has surveyed the conditions of his age so calmly , so dispassionately , and with so patient a determination to understand them that he may with certainty be said to have been responsible in no small degree for their continuous improvement .


HAROLD J. LASKI	PERSON	.

		MEMORABILIA DIPLOMATIC A. * The contents of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's `` Reminis - cences of a War-Time Statesman and Dip - lomat '' were put together at the close of a long life , many years after the occurrence of all the more important events with which they deal .

		The official career of the author cov - ered a period of deep and impassioned emotions , the Civil War , the era of recon - struction , the contested presidential election of
1876	DATE	, and the internal party disturbances REMINISCENCES OF A WAR-TIME STATESMAN AND DIPLO - MAT , 1830-1915 .

$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 389 growing out of the breaking away of Presi - dent
Hayes	PERSON	from the hitherto dominant atti - tude of his political associates .

		The author himself , together with his illustrious father , was violently assaulted and escaped assassina - tion only by the narrowest margin , at the time when
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	fell .

		Furthermore , the record of his father , in point of ability and judgment as a cabinet minister , has been vigorously assailed by many writers during the fifty years that have passed since the close of the Civil War .

		Evidently here was material which might have been handled with a very vigorous and caustic pen , without occasioning any surprise to the reader .

		Those who have read the voluminous Diary of
Gideon Welles	PERSON	,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's peppery Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, will remember how many occa - sions he found for wielding the lash in deal - ing with his contemporaries of the earlier portion of the period in question .

		But Mr.
Seward	PERSON	has taken to himself in its fullest sense the scriptural injunction , - Let not the sun go down upon your wrath . ''

		From his vine-robed villa on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, with its tree-lined vista leading the eye down over the river and up into the distant hills beyond , come forth words only of pleasantness and peace .

		Why try to blow up the chance coals that may possibly still be smouldering under ashes which have had half a century to cool ?

		There are both writers and readers who regret the loss of any possible chance for a sensation , but the coals in question have been stirred often enough to satisfy the demands of historical truth , and Mr.
Seward	PERSON	has chosen the better part .

		Such a volume is useful to balance up a view which tends to become one-sided , just as the student of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	needs to read the genial letters of the younger Pliny after the gibes of Martial , the lashes of Juvenal , and the piercing thrusts of Tacitus , not because the latter are not true , but because they are not the whole truth .

		If the man who felt upon his own body the blows and the knife-thrusts of the assassin can live to look upon and discuss those years dispassionately , why not the rest of us ?

		Mr.
Seward	PERSON	divides his material into three parts , entitled `` Before the War , '' `` Dur - ing the War , '' and `` After the War . ''

		Read - ers of to-day , at all events those of the younger generation , will take most inter - est in the third division , with its well-told stories , first of a West Indian cruise , taken during the winter of 1865-6 to repair his father 's health ; then of a visit to
Mexico	LOCATION	, where his father and he were royally enter - tained because of the gratitude of the Mexican government and people for the aid which the
United States	LOCATION	had rendered to them in escap - ing the threatened European domination ; and finally of two journies to
Alaska	LOCATION	, the first with his father in
1869	DATE	, and the other in
1902	DATE	.

		The West Indian cruise was followed a year later by a visit to
San Domingo	LOCATION	, on the part of the author and Admiral
David D. Porter	PERSON	, to negotiate a treaty for the purchase of
Samana Bay	LOCATION	as a naval station .

		The treaty failed of acceptance in our
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, however , as did the later attempt of President Grant to bring about the annexation of
San Domingo	LOCATION	as a whole .

		Mr.
Seward	PERSON	, whose father had acquired
Alaska	LOCATION	, naturally regarded this hesitation to expand our territories as unwise . ''

		The
American Congress	ORGANIZATION	was not at that hour wise enough , '' he says , `` to accept island and naval stations as a gift , though in later years it was ready to risk thousands of lives and expend
millions of dollars	MONEY	in fighting for them . ''

		Has Mr.
Seward	PERSON	let a concealed cat out of the official bag here ?

		Did we really go into the war with
Spain	LOCATION	in order to secure islands and naval stations , and not out of pity for the oppressed Cubans ?

		`` It is per - haps useless to speculate on what might have been , '' he adds , `` but it is an interesting ques - tion whether , if we had accepted
San Domingo	LOCATION	's offers , we should ever have needed to go to war with
Spain	LOCATION	at all .

		With that island commanding the whole Antilles , and with naval stations outflanking the whole of
Cuba	LOCATION	, we should have been able to suggest to
Spain	LOCATION	that she might gracefully submit to the inevitable and retire from
Cuba	LOCATION	, instead of engaging in a hopeless contest to keep it . ''

		All of this sounds easy , of course , but the probability that it would have worked out so smoothly finds little support in the pages of human experience .

		The story of the Mexican visit makes pleasant reading because it is so refreshing a contrast , in substance , to the Mexican matter which our newspapers are serving up to us now .

		Under present circumstances one may easily forget that there is a
Mexico	LOCATION	of cour - teous and whole-hearted hospitality , of gra - cious manners and cultivated intelligence , of science and art and music and literature , of majestic cathedrals and spacious palaces .

		`` Why do people talk of a ` Protectorate ' for a country capable of such things as these ? ''

		was the exclamation of the elder
Seward	ORGANIZATION	after visiting the schools of
Guadalajara	LOCATION	, with their libraries and laboratories and gymnasiums , their hundreds of boys learning blacksmith - ing , carpentering , weaving , and tailoring , their classes in sewing , knitting , and embroid - ery , their High School band of a hundred 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	musicians , and their girls in the music hall producing the opera of `` Ernani . ''

		A genera - tion passes , and we find our newspapers all too ready to denounce
Mexico	LOCATION	as a den of half-civilized bandits , deserving nothing but the harsh tread of the soldier , sent in from the outside to restore order -LRB- and incidentally to enable outside capital to step in and exploit the untold wealth of Mexican mines and forests and ranches and oil fields -RRB- .

		No , it is well to get into our minds some of the real possibilities of the Mexican genius , as shown in Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's pages , and then to wake up to the fact that the period of which he writes was followed by an era of despotism , in which republican government was but an empty name , and the masses of the people were held under stern repression , comfortable enough for the outside capitalist who wanted only security for his financial and industrial opera - tions , but sure as Fate itself to generate a growing discontent which would finally burst forth in the revolution now in progress .

		It is a struggle upward , marred by blindness and ignorance , indeed , but upward neverthe - less ; and it would be the crime of our history for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	to step in now and uproot forever the national plant which has already shown what fine flowers of civilization it is capable of producing , and will again produce when the chilling storms of revolu - tion shall have blown over and the balmier air of a freer humanity shall flow in with its fertilizing power .

		But inexorable space cries a halt .

		On the negative side , one must say of these reminis - cences that in comparison with many other volumes of American autobiography brought out in recent years , they bring us into per - sonal contact with extremely few of the author 's great contemporaries .

		Scarcely a single man of literary eminence during the period in question is named , from cover to cover .

		But so little is said of many eminent political men of the time that we must per - haps assume that the author intentionally held himself within rigidly predetermined limits -
W. H. JOHNSON	PERSON	.

		`` War Bread , '' by
Edward Eyre Hunt	PERSON	, is the title of one of the recent announcements of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author is the American delegate of the
Commission for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in
Belgium	LOCATION	, in charge of the Portress and Province of
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		This is the first authoritative account of the Belgian relief work in book form , and pre - sents the story of an eyewitness to one of the great tragedies in history .

		Two STUDIES OF
MAETERLINCK	PERSON	.

		*
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is said to have defined himself as `` un esprit qui se laisse aller au mystere . ''

		This is a by-path which may perhaps be per - mitted to poets , possibly even to a certain type of philosopher ; but when their inter - preters imitate them , it is time to cry `` halt . ''

		To pile Pelion on
Ossa	ORGANIZATION	is but an indifferent way of bringing into relief the sinuosities of the latter .

		Such , at least , will be the feeling of the average uninitiated reader after a perusal of Miss
Taylor	PERSON	's critical study of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		The author has some interesting ideas , but she presents them under such a mass of rhetorical padding that few will have the patience to dig them out .

		Her whole book shows a lack of proportion .

		By far too much space and importance are given to frankly juvenile works .

		The chapter devoted to the lyrics , `` Lies Serres Chaudes , '' might have been made to justify itself as a sort of prelude showing the state of mind in which the early plays were composed , but
Miss Taylor	PERSON	has not made the most of the oppor - tunity afforded .

		`` La Princesse Maleine '' receives more detailed treatment than any of the other plays , and with the exception of `` Monna Vanna '' is the only one of which a full resume is given .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	uses it to emphasize the peculiar type of terror which characterizes the early dramas .

		It contains faint echoes of the Elizabethans , but the idea of the supernatural is different .

		Macbeth , appalled at the spectacle of the phantom shape in the banqueting hall of
Forres Palace	ORGANIZATION	, derives his dread far more from his consciousness of guilt than from the phantasmal visions ; .

		.

		Maeter - linck 's terror is a ghost that walks invisible , his fear has the quality of the unseen , the uncertain , of that abstract and sombre power of which the shadow alone is perceptible , .

		.

		it is indeed , the soul of the plot .

		So far so good ; but carried away with her idea ,
Miss Taylor	PERSON	makes an unfortunate state - ment at the end of the chapter .

		`` The shut eyelids -LSB- of the Princess Maleine -RSB- hide from our imagination the nightmare vision of those eyes , the vision they mirrored of the invisi - ble . ''

		But
Maeterlinck	PERSON	had insisted that the eyes of the Princess remained open in death .

		The third chapter , entitled `` Love Dramas , '' discusses less the plays themselves than
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's conception of love .

		The result is far from satisfying .

		The reader unfamiliar with the plays is tantalized , his ignorance seems to deprive him of the appreciation of profound thought .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 391 is reminded of the taunt addressed to Theopompus by Phalinus in Zenophon : `` You look like a philosopher , young man , and your speech is not without grace , but know you are talking nonsense . ''


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's mystere , which if sometimes puerile , is at least marked by simplicity , becomes pretentious in
Miss Taylor	LOCATION	's pages .

		Tis no such matter , one thinks in petto at the end of her discussion .

		The chapter on the death dramas is better , and contains at least one pregnant idea .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	is much interested in folk-lore , and frequently points out the relations between it and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's plays .

		Writing of '' L ` Intruse , '' she says : For here , as in conte after conte , death sends his warning , the intersigne of Breton tradition , to herald his coming .

		A chill breath of wind in a windless night , the sound of tears that fall when no man weeps , the whisper of voices when no voices are , the splash of oars when no boat nears the shore , a lighted taper barring a twilight road : signs patent to the seer , but sealed to those whose spiritual senses are shut to them .

		Such an influence would throw light on many a curious scene in the dramas .

		`` Monna Vanna '' receives a chapter by itself , and nowhere has Miss
Taylor	PERSON	succeeded better in conveying a clear impression to the reader .

		She marks as follows the contrast between this masterpiece and the earlier plays :
Monna Vanna	PERSON	-LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- is a milestone evidencing how far already the dramatist of Maleine has travelled upon the road trodden by the moralist of La Sagesse et La Bestinee .

		The change is radical in every respect .

		Personalities with distinct characteristics supplant the type-figures of the early dramas .

		The atmosphere has lost its haze ; the gray tinted mist has lifted its veil .

		The substitution of will for destiny is empha - sized , and Novalis 's words , `` character becomes destiny , '' are effectively quoted .

		The analysis of the play and the study of the characters are sound and suggestive .


Given Miss Taylor	ORGANIZATION	's interest in searching out rather far-fetched relations between
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's treatment of his themes and those of his predecessors , it is a little curious that she says nothing of
Browning	PERSON	's `` Luria . ''

		The writer 's treatment of `` Joyzelle '' and the later plays is less satisfying .

		Apparently she found nothing in them worthy of special interest .

		In passing I may note that it is scarcely accurate to state that
Joyzelle	PERSON	`` refuses the alternative ,
Merlin	PERSON	, for the test - ing of her love offers , '' as `` the Magdeleine of the play -LSB- ``
Marie Magdeleine	PERSON	'' -RSB- rejects a like temptation . ''

		Joyzelle accepts , though with -LSB- the intention of slaying
Merlin	PERSON	, and thus saves her lover 's life .

		The last chapters are largely occupied with a study of the essays of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Here , as always ,
Miss Taylor	PERSON	writes too much around her subject to give a clear idea to the reader .

		She seems inclined to avoid the corps a corps .

		The most interesting part of her discussion is the introductory chapter , in which she con - siders the various types of mysticism before
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		The old mystics had sought God in God , or God in Nature ;
Maeterlinck	PERSON	looks for God in Man .

		He `` concentrated his interest upon the moods of humanity alone , his sym - pathies are totally absorbed in the contem - plation of man 's emotions , griefs , and desires . ''

		Once more she quotes -LRB-
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's translation of ? -RRB-

		Novalis : `` En elargissant , en developpant notre activite , nous nous trans - formerons en fatalie '' ; or , as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	himself puts it : `` Si Judas sort ce soir , il ira vers Judas et aura 1 ` occasion de trahir , mais si Socrate ouvre sa porte , il trouvera Socrate endonni sur le seuil et aura 1 ` occasion d'etre .

		sage .

		Nos aventures errent autour de nous comme les abeilles sur le point d'essaimer errent autour de la ruche .

		Elles attendent que 1 ` idee-mere sorte enfin de notre ame . ''

		This note is a refreshing one , and may prove worthy of consideration to-day when denial of personal responsibility threatens the moral world with chaos .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	's insistence on the early works of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	gives the unfortunate impression that he is decidedly a decadent .

		To turn from
Miss Taylor	ORGANIZATION	's book to Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's ``
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, Poet and Philosopher , '' is to issue from the vague atmosphere of the early plays to the straightforward impressive clarity of `` Monna Vanna . ''

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	, realiz - ing the difficulty that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	presents to the average reader , leaves no stone unturned to bring into clear relief the essential features of the separate works , and to trace the devel - opment of the thought of his author .

		An outline of each play , followed by interpre - tative comments and a detailed study of the philosophical essays , enables Mr.
Clark	PERSON	to show the underlying unity of
Maeterlinck	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		After an introductory chapter of biography , containing brief notices in chronological order of all the plays and essays , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	divides
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's work into three periods , with a connecting link , marked by study of ancient and modern mystics , between the first and the second .

		The first period is filled with intense gloom : plurima mortis imago is the real protagonist .

		The first volume of essays , `` Le Tresor des Humbles , '' marks the transi - tion to the second period , one of triumphant optimism , in which character is seen to be 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	mightier than destiny .

		The treasure of the humble is the heritage of spiritual force to which every life adds , and from which all may derive strength .

		As every individual soul is only an atom of the cosmic soul , the progress of the individual contributes directly to the progress of the race .

		No spiritual gain is ever lost , and the ignorant peasant is the richer because Plato lived .

		Armed with such might ,
Aglavaine	LOCATION	,
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, Ariane , and
Joyzelle	PERSON	are personalities who dominate cir - cumstances ; spirit has come back into its own .

		In `` La Sagesse et la Destinee '' we are assured `` that to the sage the event per se matters little ; that it is the way in which he allows it to influence him that counts for him . ''

		The third period , which is still permeated by courageous optimism , shows a more pru - dent attitude , even a `` suggestion of compro - mise . ''

		Man may guide his destiny to a large extent , but there are external forces which defy him .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has not been so success - ful in applying his formula to the individual works of the third period as in his first two divisions .

		Perhaps the more temperate tone is rather implied than expressed .

		Happily , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	is not one who would pigeon-hole the author or any of his writings .

		He laughs at the efforts of various critics to label him , and considers his books in their interrelation to each otl er and to
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's whole thought .

		The intense spirituality of the dramas , both in word and deed , showed that the doctrine of the essays was no mere empty idealism , but could be embodied in character .

		All his works are jointly sources from which to draw his philosophy ; that the stream to which they contribute takes a wide sweep as it broadens and deepens , and at times seems to leave some of them far behind , does not alter the fact that they are necessary tributary streamlets , without which the whole were poorer .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's philosophical thought shows a blending of individualism and altruism , of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Self-sacrifice is not per se a noble virtue .

		One must look to one 's own development before one can aid in the onward march of the race .

		Maeterlinck finds greater spiritual advance in women than in men , a belief which explains the strength of his feminine characters .

		Astolaine is the first to show soul development : Aglavaine , the first to recognize that she has a soul with a right to its own existence .

		Ariane carries on the lighted torch to
Giovanna	LOCATION	, from whom Joyzelle bears it aloft in both hands to kindle in
Marie Magdeleine	PERSON	the soul which has made her almost worthy of beatification in the
Koman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's interpretation of `` Ariane et Barbe Bleue '' is striking .

		He sees in this play , of which the author himself speaks rather slightingly , a recognition of the reawakening of woman .

		He quotes effectively Ariane 's words to her cowed comrades : `` To begin with , we must disobey ; that is the first duty when the command given contains a threat instead of an explanation . ''

		A substantial portion of the book is given to a critical discussion of the essays .

		The note that runs through them all is the insist - ence on the power of ideals as opposed to material force .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's quest is for truth , beauty , and justice , and it is by increased spiritual insight that he would find them .

		The theory of `` the static drama , '' the genre
Maeterlinck	PERSON	believes is to dominate the future , is bound up with this idealistic thought .

		In his essay on `` Le Drame Moderne , '' contained in `` Le Double Jardin , '' he writes : What , at the first glance , characterizes the drama of to-day is , to begin with , the weakening , or , so to speak , the progressive paralysis of exterior action ; then a very clear tendency to dip into the human conscience , and to grant a greater part to moral problems ; and finally , the search , still somewhat a blind one , for a sort of new poetry more abstract than the old .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's comments upon this are decidedly worth while : In the banishment of action is expelled what has been considered the mainspring of the drama : the classical drama related its stirring actions , the so-called romantic drama enacted them vividly upon the stage ... The followers of the classical school objected to violent action taking place on the stage , and adopted the device of using messengers , confi - dants , etc. , in order to introduce the report of any action into the spectacle .

		On this head
Maeterlinck	PERSON	only seeks to go a little farther : he would consider the violent action reported by messengers and others as arbitrary and intrusive , and exclude such from his pieces , with the effect of obtaining a greater unity of action than even the rigid classicals had ever dreamed ... He considers the demand for the strikingly spectacular as barbaric , and would weave his drama round soul-states , rather than bodily acts .

		One of the most interesting chapters of Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's work is a study of the various sources from which
Maeterlinck	PERSON	has drawn inspira - tion .

		His indebtedness to each is shown by comparisons that are always suggestive .

		Among purely literary influences , the English seems to be the most important , but French , German , Russian , and Norwegian authors have left their mark on his thought .

		Among the philosophers ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	is most akin to the Stoics and Mystics .

		Of the former he mentions most frequently
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	; of the latter ,
Ruysbroek	LOCATION	, Novalis , and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		`` In Maeterlinck , '' says Mr.
Clark	PERSON	, `` the pure lofty dreams of the mystical imag - ination are blended with the simple austerity of the Stoical outlook on life . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE Df AL 393 Stoic and Mystic both sects possessed a i calm power of resistance to brute force of which the greatest of Belgian men of letters j must be a peculiarly acceptable interpreter to the future .

		It is such a place that Mr.
Clark	PERSON	| would give
Maeterlinck	PERSON	in modern thought .

		THE OXFORD MOVEMENT ITS RESTJLTS .

		* The recent lamented death of
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	has brought anew to the attention of the reading world that astonishing episode in the religious history of modern
Europe	LOCATION	which is known as the Catholic revival .

		Begun in
France	LOCATION	by De Maistre , and in
Germany	LOCATION	by Stolberg and
Friedrich Schlegel	PERSON	, as a natural reaction against the moral anarchy of the Revolution , it was forwarded on the continent , in their different ways , by such diverse spirits as
Lamennais	LOCATION	,
Lacordaire	LOCATION	,
Montalembert	LOCATION	, and Veuillot ,
Gorres	LOCATION	,
Mohler	PERSON	, and
Dollinger	PERSON	.

		But this continental awakening had little effect , at least in its earlier stages , upon the frost - bound Catholicism of
England	LOCATION	.


Newman	PERSON	has described in a notable sermon the condition of English Catholics in the
early years of the century	DATE	, `` a few adherents of the old Reli - gion , moving silently and sorrowfully about , as memorials of what had been '' ; u a gens lucifuga , a people who shunned the light of day . ''

		Their `` second
spring	DATE	'' was to come not from
France	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	, but from the stronghold of that Faith that had first repudiated and then oppressed them , the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new and more aggressive Catholic mind had first to be formed in the nation , and the leaders of the new movement trained : and this process was performed , quite unconsciously , of course , by the `` Tractarians . ''

		With the conversion of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	,
Manning	PERSON	, and
William George Ward	PERSON	, and the statesmanlike activity of
Wiseman	PERSON	, the Catholic revival in
England	LOCATION	begins .

		Of it the Wards , father and son , were indeed `` a great part , '' the elder by his brilliant and aggressive ultramontanism , the younger by his broad and philosophic liberal - ism .

		Both were editors of `` The
Dublin	LOCATION	Review . ''

		tution and the type that represents loyalty to an idea .

		With the passing of
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	, `` Newmanism '' has lost its most dis - tinguished champion , for , like his father in the old Oxford days , he too could say with truth , `` Credo in Newmannum . ''

		The publication of an English translation of
M. Thureau-Dangin	PERSON	's admirable work ,
La Renaissance Catholique en Angleterre	ORGANIZATION	au XIXe Siecle , is therefore very timely .

		It forms a most useful supplement , for English readers , to Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's delightful books on the subject , and especially to his monumental life of
Newman	PERSON	.

		It reveals in many places an intellectual attitude very similar to Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's , and indeed
M. Thureau-Dangin	PERSON	's last work , published in
1912	DATE	, a year before his death , was a digest , for French readers , of Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's ``
Newman	PERSON	, '' under the title , New - man Catholique .

		The surprising thing is that
M. Thureau	PERSON	-
Dangin	PERSON	's book should have waited so long for a translator .

		The first volume , devoted to ``
Newman	PERSON	and the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	, '' appeared in
1899	DATE	, and was shortly followed by two others , bringing the narrative down to the death of Manning in
1892	DATE	.

		In its original form , the work is one of the most notable indications of the wide interest felt in
France	LOCATION	, during the past twenty years , in
Newman	PERSON	and his influence on modern Catholic thinking .

		Nowhere perhaps has that influence been so marked or so beneficial , and nowhere has it given rise to literary work of so great interest and importance .

		It is quite safe to say that with the exception of Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's writings , the best work that has been done on
Newman	PERSON	and his school within recent years has been done by Frenchmen .

		The names of Dimnet ,
Bremond	PERSON	, and
Madame Lucie Faure Goyau	PERSON	, to mention only the best known , are illustrations of the high type of talent that has been devoted to the service of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		These names suggest also his relation to the broadest and most liberal school of Catholicism , and indicate the part that he is still to play in the interpreta - tion of Catholic doctrine to the modern world .

		But if it is surprising that
M. Thureau	PERSON	-
Dangin	PERSON	's book should have gone so long untranslated , it is still more surprising that it should not have been translated with the most scrupulous care .

		The name of
Wilber	PERSON	- force on the title-page of a book on this sub - ject ought to be a guarantee of competence , but there is no indication who it was that `` revised and re-edited * ' it after the trans - lator 's death .

		In fact , the translation has the appearance of a work to which the author 's 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	last hand has not been given , though even this does not account for its most inexcusable fault , that of not accurately representing the original .

		Much of it indeed is not transla - tion at all , but free paraphrase .

		Whole pages are mere abstracts of important passages in the French text , and this without a word of editorial warning .

		Many passages are omitted altogether , among them numberless foot-notes and three valuable bibliographies .

		It is obvious that an English reader would be con - cerned to know whether the foreign author of a book of this kind had consulted the lead - ing authorities ; but this information is denied him .

		As a matter of fact ,
M. Thureau	PERSON	-
Dangin	PERSON	's lists seem to include all the impor - tant works on the subject .

		Moreover , while the translation is , for the most part , fluent and idiomatic , it abounds in amazing errors , passages in which the sense of the original is wholly misconceived .

		And finally , neither translator nor editor apparently considered it any part of his duty to bring the book up to date by supplying it with annotations drawn from the most recent works on the subject .

		In eleven hundred pages there are only three notes by the translator , though
Ward	PERSON	's `` Newman '' is a mine of pertinent information .

		Indeed , M. Thureau-Dangin more than once expresses regret that he had not access to
Newman	PERSON	's long-withheld cor - respondence .

		These faults and omissions would be less grave in a work of less significance ; but , in spite of them , the book is of high interest and value to the English reader .

		It is a history , written from the Catholic point of view and with the most admirable temper , of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	and its results .

		There is nothing like it in English , and it is all the more valuable because of its French origin .

		The author 's attitude toward Anglicanism is singularly sympathetic .

		While he makes the compromises and logical weaknesses of the Anglican position abundantly clear , he treats the Anglican leaders with a deference and respect that are not in the least qualified by his fundamental inability to agree with them .

		The last four chapters in particular , which are devoted to the fortunes of Ritualism , are written with the utmost comprehension and sympathy , and should prove highly illumi - nating to those persons , Catholic or other , who are ignorant or scornful of the beliefs and practices of the Catholic party in the English Church .

		Nor are the opinions of the
Broad Church	ORGANIZATION	party handled with less liberality .

		It would be difficult to imagine a treatment of the subject less likely to arouse controversy or more certain to lead to that spirit of mutual sympathy and comprehension between Anglicans and Roman Catholics out of which some day may arise a new `` peace of the church . ''

		We meet in these pages all the great men of the Movement and of the Catholic revival that succeeded it ,
Newman	PERSON	,
Manning	PERSON	,
Ward r Pusey	ORGANIZATION	,
Wiseman	PERSON	,
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Faber	PERSON	, the
Wilber	PERSON	- forces , and numberless others ; but
Newman	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	are of course the central figures .

		In dealing with
Manning	PERSON	, the author had the advantage of
Purcell	PERSON	's much-discussed biog - raphy , which he uses with great discretion ; but in dealing with
Newman	PERSON	he was without much of the information which is now acces - sible .

		It is the more remarkable that he should have given an account of
Newman 's Catholic	ORGANIZATION	life which calls for few if any corrections from the pages of Ward .

		In his treatment of these two great men , great in such different ways , and of their relation to each other , he has written with the utmost frankness and with admirable judgment .

		He does not attempt to minimize the unhappy divisions between them , though he refuses to attribute those divisions to any personal feeling on either side .

		They were due simply to a temperamental difference between the two men in their attitude toward religious truth and their conception of the best means of making it prevail .

		His sympathies , however , are clearly with
Newman	PERSON	; and , indeed , judg - ing from this book , one would conclude that , the type of Catholicism represented by
M. Thureau-Dangin	PERSON	is the type that looks to
Newman	PERSON	as its founder .

		The author more than once implies his conviction that the Grammar of Assent is the foundation and starting-point of modern Catholic philosophy , an opinion shared , oddly enough , by
William George Ward	PERSON	, in spite of his wide divergence from the school of
Newman	PERSON	.

		One can not but reflect that if the type of
Catholi	LOCATION	- cism represented by
Newman	PERSON	and
M. Thu	PERSON	- reau-Dangin and the younger Ward were more in evidence , it would be less difficult for unsympathetic Protestants to understand the Church , and for sympathetic ones to justify their sympathy .

		But unfortunately , though perhaps naturally , it is the
Manning	PERSON	type that , by its very zeal and aggressiveness , seems exclusively to express the mind of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		In any case , the task of rendering modern Catholicism comprehensible to those outside its pale is a task to which an able and instructed Catholic might well devote his life r for it is a service to religion in general and so to civilization .

		Such a service we can not but feel M. Thureau-Dangin has rendered .

Whitman	PERSON	made her home in the city of her birth .

		In
November , 1848	DATE	, after a brief but highly romantic courtship , Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	entered into a conditional engagement with the poet
Poe	PERSON	, whose wife had died early in
1847	DATE	; but this engagement was broken off in the following month only a. day or two before that appointed for their marriage .

		Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	published in
1860	DATE	a volume , ``
Edgar Poe	PERSON	and His Critics , '' in defence of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	against
Griswold	PERSON	and other unsym - pathetic biographers .

		In
1853	DATE	a volume of her poems , `` Hours of Life , and Other Poems , '' was brought out , and a collected edition of her verses was published shortly after her death .

		The story of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	's life has been told again and again by editors and biog - raphers of
Poe	PERSON	; but it has now been told anew and at length in a handsome volume from the pen of Miss
Caroline Ticknor	PERSON	.

		Much of the material included in this volume , as Miss Ticknor frankly states in her Preface , had already been given to the world .

		Here , for instance , are the impassioned love-letters written by
Poe	PERSON	to Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	in the
fall	DATE	and
winter of 1848	DATE	, first published in their completeness by Professor
J. A. Harrison	PERSON	in
1909	DATE	.

		Here , again , are the particulars of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's wooing of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	and of the preparations made for the wedding that was not to be , particulars already set forth in an article contributed by Professor
Harrison	PERSON	and
Miss Charlotte Dailey	PERSON	to `` The Century Magazine '' in

Clemm	PERSON	, some from
Griswold	LOCATION	, some from Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	herself -LRB- though we are still without the letters of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	to
Poe	PERSON	-RRB- ; and we have a lengthy account of the bickerings indulged in by certain of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's earlier biographers , together with much new information about Mrs.
Lewis	PERSON	, Mrs.
Shew	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gove-Nichols	PERSON	, Mrs.
Ellet	PERSON	, and other romantic women with whom the poet came into contact in his `` lone - some latter years . ''

		In all this there is noth - ing that is discreditable to Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	, and little that is discreditable to
Poe	PERSON	; but Mrs.
Lewis	PERSON	appears in an unenviable light , and the unlovely side of Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	's later history is relentlessly exposed .

		Both Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	and Mrs.
Osgood	PERSON	, we learn , disap - proved heartily of Mrs.
Lewis	PERSON	; and Mrs.
Osgood	PERSON	is cited as authority for the statement that Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	was `` a thorn in
Poe	PERSON	's side '' and was `` always embroiling him in difficul - ties . ''

		Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	, so we are told , had `` throughout her life a succession of adorers , '' her hand being `` sought in marriage , even in her latest years . ''

		It is suggested that Mr.
Pabodie	PERSON	, who assumed the part of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's friend and comrade on the occasion of his last visit to Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	's home , was among these adorers , and that he was in reality an active agent in bringing about the rupture between Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	and the unhappy poet .

		Inter - esting information is also brought out as to
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's trip to
Richmond	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1848	DATE	, as to Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	's interpretation of the lyric , `` To
Helen	PERSON	, '' addressed to her by
Poe	PERSON	, and as to the grounds on which Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	based her belief an erroneous one , beyond all doubt that ``
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' was a `` veiled expression '' of the poet 's `` undying remembrance of her . ''

		Poe once declared that Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	's poetry was `` instinct with genius . ''

		Miss Ticknor expresses the opinion that her `` poetic contributions '' entitle her to `` literary immor - tality . ''

		We are bound to believe that this is excessive praise .

		Poetic gifts she undoubt - edly had , but her verses lack the energy and the intensity that are necessary to secure enduring fame .

		Her name will live , if indeed it is destined to live , mainly by reason of its association with that of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	.

		In like manner , the chief importance of the present volume must be sought in the informa - tion that it furnishes about
Poe	PERSON	and the unholy atmosphere in which he spent his declining days .

		But the volume must also find its justification in the fuller knowledge that it gives of the life of Mrs.

Howells	PERSON	was the chronicler of the utterance , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	who also said on his own account , `` Ah !

		poor Real Life , which I love , can I make others see the delight I find in thy foolish and insipid face ? ''

		In those days Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	was a girl of much the same age as Kitty , but she must have had a very different ideal in literature .

		Anyone who is tired of books like
Miss Kitty	LOCATION	's favor - ite `` Details '' can always turn to Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	for relief , for she never writes of ordinary people save as foil or relief , and only rarely of ordinary things .

		In that charming old time when both `` Pinafore '' and
Pater	PERSON	flourished , when
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	was still full of the recollection of
Newman	PERSON	and
Pusey	PERSON	, and of
T. H. Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, as well as of more light - minded and able-bodied persons whose names survive chiefly in the annals of boating and cricket , there came to stay with her guardian , a classical reader at the
University	ORGANIZATION	, a certain Lady
Constance Bledlow	PERSON	, who was one of the most charming people imaginable .

		She was the orphan daughter of a rich English peer who had lived long in
Italy	LOCATION	and she had become an epitome of all that was delight - ful in English aristocracy and cosmopolitan culture as well as in feminine attraction .

		When she appeared , she made a clean sweep .

		Not only was everybody charmed with her , but when she went to a great reception given in honor of the Lord Chancellor she became almost the guest of the evening in place of the great statesmen , with the voix d'or well - known in courts and in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		Fellows , professors , masters , doctors , heads of colleges crowded around her , and the
Lord Chancel	LOCATION	- lor himself proved to be a great friend of hers .

		And it was not only the learned world of Oxford which she at once subdued , but the undergraduate world also , so far as it was * LADY CONNIE .

		able , fell at her feet .

		Particularly was this so with
Douglas Falloden	PERSON	, the son of a rich old
Yorkshire	LOCATION	baronet and himself one of the ablest and haughtiest aristocrats at
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A renowned scholar and winner of the Newdigate and the
Ireland	LOCATION	-LRB- in a fiercely contested year -RRB- , he was equally famous as an athlete and a `` blood , '' for the story is of the day when that quaint old expression was current .

		She was charming if not absolutely beautiful , winning , wonder - ful , and he was strong , imperious , and also wonderful , and there you are .

		The time is long passed for discussing the claims of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	to greatness .

		One will find in her as in some greater and many lesser writers a brilliant picture of an interesting life , but it will be such a pic - ture as to leave one with the sense of being on the outside .

		She always talks and tells of remarkable and wonderful and charming and delightful things and people , but she rarely gives us more of an impression than is given by anybody 's talking and telling of some - body else .

		As one of her own people says , `` They tell us they 're splendid fellows , and , of course , we must believe them .

		But who 's to know ? ''

		Even in ``
Robert Elsmere	LOCATION	'' was this peculiarity apparent .

		That terrible Squire was always throwing a biting epigram across the table , but the reader never had any of them .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's world is the world of gossip , greater and less , the won - derful voix d'or is known in courts and par - liaments , the
Ireland	LOCATION	was won in a hotly contested year .

		The great world of intellect , fashion , art , culture , passes before us and we may admire if we will , but we rarely get beyond that ; we are outsiders and held severely at a distance .

		All that is well enough perhaps ; it may be that we should not be able to appreciate the ideas and the feelings of the
august	DATE	, but whether we should or should not is of no consequence , for we never have a chance .

		This is more the case in `` Lady Connie '' than in some other of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's books ; we feel that we have had a pleasant glimpse at an interesting life , but after all it is the way spectators might look at a great ball .

		Nothing of this sort will be said of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's `` Rodmoor . ''

		The world is very different for one thing .

		It is not the world of culture and art and public life as it exists in the general convention of agreement by cultivated people , the well-understood world of Oxford halls and charming old country houses where people are known by the color of their cricket caps or the cut of their gowns .

		It is an out-of-the-way and obscure world r
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 397 in a remote part of
England	LOCATION	already half washed away by the sea , a country hardly known outside its own melancholy borders .

		Nor do the people belong to the well-under - stood if noteworthy classes that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is apt to deal with , distinguished scholars , English or cosmopolitan , men of political or social position , women of recognized culture .

		They are people of no especially distinguish - able class , and even if they were it would matter little , for class or not , they are crea - tions chiefly of an intense individuality .

		Instead of being people to be admired , people of attraction , charm , distinction , people who realize ideals we may have often had for ourselves , they are a fierce , half-crazy set whom we should think it a great misfortune to resemble in any way .

		Not only are they nearly crazy themselves , but they are driven almost to mania by the morbid influences of the desolate place where they pass their aston - ishing lives .

		Yet with all this , there is one interesting thing about them : what they are , they themselves are ; no one has to tell us anything about them .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	very probably would give a different account of his characters from mine , indeed , he does now and then , but it does not matter what he says of them .

		There they are ; one can judge for oneself .

		Whatever you may think of such an exhibi - tion , it has at least a sort of reality ; it gives the impression at least of going deeper into life , of not merely viewing as an admiring spectator the superficial and conventional phases that one reads of in every newspaper or sees at every dinner table , but of actually exploring some of the deeply hidden springs of action in the hearts of men and women .

		Adrian and Brand and
Phillippa	PERSON	were , and were meant to be , actually tinged with mania of some sort , but
Hamish Traherne	PERSON	and
Baltazer Stock	ORGANIZATION	and
Linda Herrick	PERSON	are not much better .

		The only sane person in the book , as somebody practically says , is a sad - faced , religious mother .

		But crazy or not , they are people of sensitive and intense feel - ing , which Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has no difficulty in making us appreciate .

		Perhaps this may not be actually a truer view of life than Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's .

		In `` Lady Connie '' the imperious aristocrat of a hero is mad with jealousy and irretrievably injures !

		a foreign artist by throwing him into a foun - tain .

		The artist recovers his general health but slowly , and the aristocrat endeavors to make atonement by going to live with him in a little cottage outside
Oxford	LOCATION	, where he some - times sees Lady Connie who visits the young artist in the quality of an affectionate sister .

		In `` Rodmoor ''
Phillippa	PERSON	, a girl of a boy - like , sexless , Sapphic charm who could walk with
Adrian	PERSON	or swim with him indifferently , is on some excursion with him shortly before his wedding to someone else .

		They come to a barn and are sitting down in the shade when
Adrian	PERSON	goes up into the loft and wants
Phillippa	LOCATION	to come up too .

		She does not care to , and he being insistent comes down to tie a rope around her and pull her up .

		When she resists , he gives her a great whack on the chest with the rope .

		This breaks her spirit , and she becomes a woman and falls dead in love with him .

		It may be hard to say which of the two situations is more actually real , but Mr.
Powys	PERSON	certainly has less of the well - established convention .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	does not probe very deeply into the mysteries of the human spirit , but at least he makes his effort .

		He is not content to give us easy references to things which are well known and of good report ; he wants to make us see and feel for ourselves .

		Possibly he has an easier task .

		Really to understand people like
Douglas Falloden	PERSON	and
Constance Bledlow	PERSON	may be a difficult matter .

		It is doubtless easier merely to tell how he studied all night and how everybody crowded round her at the ball .

		It may indeed be easier to present these extravagants like
Adrian	PERSON	and
Phillippa	PERSON	than those whose true nature expresses itself in the ordinary conventionalities .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	fol - lows distinguished masters ;
Emily Bronte	PERSON	and
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	have given him some ideas on the extravagant and sensitive possibilities of men and women .

		But of whomever he has learned , he has gained the desire to look beneath the surface and see for himself , and that desire is in itself a great thing .

		As Mr.
Powys	PERSON	seems to have the desire to get at some of the deeply hidden springs of power in human life , Mr.
Algernon Black	PERSON	- wood goes even deeper in his explorations of the life of the human soul .

		His book is writ - ten with the conception of a life of the soul which reaches back into the past for century after century , and he pursues his thesis with the seriousness of an actual student ; in fact .

		I must confess myself uncertain as to whether Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	is a student who wishes to clothe a great idea in a form that will attract attention and arouse interest , or a novelist with a taste for the mysterious and the remarkable who finds in the ancient belief the chance to present that combination of people and story which makes a good novel .

		It is fortunately unnecessary to decide ; few of us even though deeply interested would accept such a view on the authority of a work of fiction of whatever excellence .

		If we read 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	with sympathy , with interest , with convic - tion even , we may gain a will to believe , but we shall naturally wish to go to rather differ - ent sources for more definite conviction .

		Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	's story is one of the trans - migration of souls , or , rather , of the power of the soul in our day to recall essential circum - stances of its life in past avatars .

		There have been other such stories ; one of the latest was Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's `` The Star Rover . ''

		But while Mr.
London	PERSON	's book seemed merely the work of an imaginative mind dealing with the fancy of pre-existent forms , Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	has a much more serious , even systematic , way of looking at his question and has produced a more inter - esting book .

		I am frankly ignorant of the `` literature of the subject , '' but I suppose that from very ancient times , from times older than
Pythagoras	PERSON	and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, men have looked with intense and deep curiosity at those things that happen in our life that seem to indicate that we have lived before .

		Whatever the philosophers have said , there are not a few of such questionings in literature .

		Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	takes this recognition , this bring - ing back to recollection memories of a very ancient past , and thereon builds his book .

		I presume I do him no wrong if I say that his particular idea seems unconvincing .

		That the souls of the persons of the writer , of
Julius LeVallon	PERSON	, of the woman whom
Julius	PERSON	had found and married , should meet after cen - turies and should be able to right an old wrong , this consequence of the belief that the soul has lived in the past does not seem to me very well assured .

		But even if it were , perhaps it would not be so interesting as the belief which Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	enforces much better in the life of the soul to-day .

		The soul in
Julius	LOCATION	, in the friend of his boyhood , in his wife , we do get some impression of them , or at least the impression that they exist and have a life rather different from the life to which we are accustomed .

		The people we commonly see in novels , perhaps with a certain external superficiality , or moved by a deeper understanding , do we get at the life of their souls ?

		Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	would have us understand that there is a life of the soul .

		It is one of the hardest things to do this presentation of what everybody believes and that Mr.
Black	PERSON	- wood should even in some measure be able to do it , gives his book a position apart from many books that we approve for other reasons .

		Such are some of the variations we had others in our last number which will inter - est those who like to find in fiction something a little more exciting than the careful and habitual happenings of every-day existence .

		If real life be so foolish and insipid , so dull and commonplace that we get enough in fact and wish to escape from it in imagination , here are the means .

		The distinguished life of art and culture , the fierce and individual life of passion , the deep and sacred life of the soul , seen with greater or less depth or penetration , these offer an opportunity that may be easily grasped .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		ox !

		N ~ E \ v FICTION Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	stands well at the head of
England	LOCATION	's minor novelists .

		A rapid writer , always steeped in the atmosphere of his subject , possessing an instinct for word pictures and an insight into character , his figure is of deserved significance in contemporary literature .

		His new novel , `` The Green Alleys '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , belongs to the industrial cycle of ``
Brunei	LOCATION	's Tower '' and `` Old Delabole . ''

		He has chosen the hop-growing land of Kent for his scene .

		Com - parison with Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is inevitable , for like Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	he makes Nature a vital force in his story ; but unlike Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, he makes it an agent for happiness instead of a blind destiny - bearing force .

		Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	's hop-vines , like his
Cornwall	LOCATION	slate-quarries , remain in our minds as real and as active as any of his human char - acters .

		Under the shadow of their green alleys
Nathan	PERSON	and
Nicholas	PERSON	grew to manhood .

		Nathan , though the elder of the brothers , had had the misfortune to come into the world before the mar - riage of his parents , and consequently
Nicholas	PERSON	was by English law the inheritor to the family wealth , the hops .

		He was rather a spoiled darling , a master in his industry , but spiritually and too often financially dependent upon
Nathan	PERSON	, who guided him with more of a father 's than a brother 's love .

		The mother admired and wor - shipped both .

		It was with the advent of Rosa
May	DATE	that trouble arose .

		She would be the saving of
Nicholas	PERSON	, the mother thought ; and when
Nicholas	PERSON	did indeed lose his heart to the girl , his career appeared to be saved .

		Nathan , the elder , concealed his deeper love .

		The conflict was bound to come to light , complicated by the misfortune of
Nathan	ORGANIZATION	's birth and by the self-assurance and the assertiveness of the younger brother .

		The mother 's fierce partisanship , yielding to her sense of justice , and finally swept under by the new spirit of
England	LOCATION	in the first months of war , is one of the finest things in the book .

		Indeed , Mr.
Phill	PERSON	- potts 's characters are all splendidly true , from the bombastic father of Rosa
May	DATE	, who `` would rather belong to the great middle-class of
England	LOCATION	than to any other order in the world , '' to the earnest and sterling
Nathan	PERSON	.

		His descriptions are equally vivid .

		One breathes the very atmosphere of the hop-picking
summer	DATE	days , when the people of the country-side swarmed about the bins and fingers flew .

		These descriptions have a rare fidelity and
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 399 beauty that are not often found .

		The reader is impressed by the ancientness of everything , from the ages-old inherited hops and the cherry - trees to the people whose family roots and instincts and traditions extended equally into the past .

		One is surprised , therefore , that possessing all these excellencies the book does not leave a deeper impression .

		But so it is , charming , readable , incisive in character-drawing and yet unimpres - sive .

		There is no flash , no livening spark .

		And part of its failure seems to be due to the modern lack the want of a plot .

		Plot laid down the cards , and character vainly tried to play the hand alone .

		Turning to Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	, we have a novelist quite as representative of
America	LOCATION	as ' , Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	is of
England	LOCATION	, and in almost every respect his antithesis .

		It is the polish , the artistry , the age that tell in `` The Green Alleys . ''

		In `` The j Trufflers '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	's i latest book , it is the vigor , the youth , the clean-cut i vitality that count .

		And Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	has a story ; to tell .

		His scene is laid in the
Latin Quarter of New York	LOCATION	, whither
Sue Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, a daughter of the Philistines , had fled in search of self-expression .

		She was `` a real natural oasis in a desert of | poseurs , '' as distinct from the exceeding self - i consciousness of her new environment as she had been from the restraint of her old .

		There
Peter Mann	PERSON	, the Broadway playwright , found her , fell under the spell of her enthusiasm and her fresh - ness , and for a long time managed to conceal from her his real nature of the posing sentimentalist . '

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	meant to make the man a posing genius , but a real genius .

		To us and to Sue , how - j ever , he remains merely an amusing if irritating poseur .

		It was
Mann	PERSON	, nevertheless , who wrote the Broadway success , `` The Truffler , '' a play cal - culated to expose the bachelor-girl characterized in j his mind as `` a confirmed seeker of pleasures and !

		delicacies in the sober game of life , utterly self - i indulgent , going it alone a truffle-hunter . ''

		Mr.
i Merwin	PERSON	's point of view apparently lies between \ the two ; we trace it in the spiritual growth of i Sue Wilde herself , from her ardent search for j naturalness in `` the Village , '' through her bitter ' awakening , to the final emergence of her mature | self - controlled personality .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	has made j her very interesting and very real .

		Peter is almost i real .

		`` The Worm , '' who finally emerges as the j true hero , is completely real a very funny , j lovable little Queedish character .

		The whole sub - | ject , of course , is chosen for its timeliness ; there is a great deal of bachelor-girl realism , talk about theatres and films , and Broadway and
Washington Square	LOCATION	.

		There is a certain cheapness about the style as about the subject , the same cheapness i that one sees in our most popular monthlies .

		; There is also an artificial construction , the work - ; ing up to a climax at the end of each chapter .

		But the point is this , that here is a straightfor - ward story with very few airs and graces , and j absolutely no attempt to imitate its European for - j bears .

		It gives the public very honestly what the public wants .

		The taste of that public may not be of the highest , it has not had much training in literature ; but it is not going to let itself be bored , and it is not going to mistake chronicle for plot .

		It would be a triumph for American fiction if it might count Miss
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	within its ranks .

		Although she has lived here and in Eng - land , the greater part of her life has been spent on the Continent .

		Likewise the Continent is the scene of her first American-published novel , `` The Dark Tower '' -LRB- Century ,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		This is the purest , cleanest-cut , and finest example of the novelist 's art among the books in this group .

		The writer has thought clearly , and she has chosen a subject worth thinking about .

		She has eliminated all that did not directly pertain to the story , either in the way of character , description , or dialogue .

		She has rounded the whole so that it stands out , with all the essential detail , an almost perfect technical triumph .

		-LRB- The word `` technical '' is used advisedly here , to signify the application of common sense to the expression of something worth expressing . -RRB-

		Her story is of
Winn Staines	PERSON	, a soldier sprung from an English county family of strong sons and daughters .

		He was n't , in the drawing-room sense of the word , `` tame . ''

		He craved `` hard sharp talk that he could answer as if it were a Punch and Judy show . ''

		He was also a little suspicious of thinking , `` it seemed to him rather like a way of getting out of things . ''

		We ca n't blame him for being a bit nasty to
Estelle	LOCATION	.

		Thirty-five years of natural living , of much hard heart-breaking work , had not served to fit him for
Estelle	ORGANIZATION	's idea of marriage .

		Claire -LRB- for it is the eternal triangle again -RRB- gave him the man-to-man companionship which alone could bring him to his knees .

		Marooned in
Davos	LOCATION	with a `` crocked '' lung , hearing night and day the fore - boding muffled sound behind padded doors , with the great snow peaks and valleys beckoning him as a symbol of freedom , he fought his love against tremendous odds , for `` the unfortunate part of being made all of a piece is that if you happen to want anything there is really no fibre of your being that does n't want it . ''

		A further result of being made all of a piece is that you are rarely able after the age of thirty-five to turn quite as `` soft '' as
Winn	PERSON	became at the end .

		Winn was a great deal more convincing when he called his wife a cat than when he manfully tucked the fur rug around Claire at
St. Moritz	LOCATION	and watched her drive away from him down the valley .

		Misa Bottome finally seeks the great modern resource .

		Winn hailed the war with a feeling of complete relief .

		Trouble of that sort was something to live and to die for .

		After a last glorious charge with his Sikhs he was found lying between the old trench and the new .

		Baldly related , this plot sadly forebodes sentimentalism .

		The treatment , however , removes all reproach .

		It is a direct and simple narrative , motivated by truthful char - 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	acter-drawing , exalted to the plane of justifiable , because inevitable , tragedy .

		Essentially it is of the stuff of mediaeval romance , made true by char - acter , with modern ideals supplanting mediaeval morals .

		For ``
Olga Bardel	PERSON	'' -LRB- Century ,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , the best thing that can be said is that it , too , is `` promis - ing . ''

		It presents , in no very new light , the prob - lem of a great genius struggling to be heard against odds , first the odds of helpless poverty , next of exploitation , finally of an unfortunate marriage .

		Mr.
Stacy Aumonier	PERSON	shows in spots a fine dramatic instinct , and there are many good scenes incorporated in it .

		The characters are fairly convincing , and never tedious .

		One feels that the author had no right to make his heroine quite so unfortunate , one feels a little cheated oneself after Fate has gone on tricking her for thirty-five years or so .

		Has he any aesthetic right to make her suffer so much ?


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	asserted that there were certain situations , how - ever accurate , from which no poetical enjoyment could be derived `` those in which the suffering finds no vent in action .

		.

		in which there is everything to be endured , nothing to be done . ''

		Though much may be said in praise of Mr.
Aumonier	PERSON	's work , the quotation is all too ap - plicable here .

		Like `` The Green Alleys , '' more - over , it leaves the impression of formlessness , or , rather , it leaves no particular impression .

		The writer has not yet learned the art of stripping his story of non-essentials .

		He is still imagist , reflect - ing the part of life that he sees , not yet interpret - ing it , nor seeing it clearly or whole .

		Cap'n
Gid	ORGANIZATION	, the hero of
Elizabeth Lincoln Gould	PERSON	's story of the same name -LRB-
Penn	LOCATION	,
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, leaves his native town for a boarding-house in the city , carry - ing his neighborliness with him .

		By the end of the third chapter one realizes that equal numbers of male and female characters have been introduced , and a premonition persuades one that they will walk out the back end of the book in couples .

		Outside this rhythmic procession lurk three horrid and unwomanly suffragettes , who are justly pun - ished for their temperaments by being left unpro - vided with husbands .

		But none the less , the book has a charming and friendly tone throughout .

		Miss
Persis Dale	PERSON	, in `` Other People 's Business , '' by
Harriet Lummis Smith	PERSON	-LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , is a fine upstanding spinster who meddles in every - body 's concerns to their great advantage , supports herself and her brother for a time by dressmak - ing , and immediately adopts five children and buys a motor-car when she comes into money .

		The only person in the book who achieves a bad end is
Miss Persis	LOCATION	's girlhood lover , who after twenty years ' residence in the city comes back smoking costly cigars and planning to deprive his neighbors of their savings .

		Thus we learn that those who go away to the city lose their simplicity of heart ; but be assured , good reader , that rustic shrewdness and honesty will outwit urban treachery , the renegade will be hounded from the town , and Miss Persis will bestow her hand , her fortune , and her adopted family upon the misunderstood but faithful store-keeper .

		She and her victims are drawn with a firm and cheerful touch ; and they are not , on the whole , `` unco ' guid . ''

		The book is decidedly pleasant reading .

		How responsively Miss Theodosia 's heartstrings quiver and throb and vibrate to every wind of sentiment !

		What a lovely and generous soul she has ; what a delightful exterior !

		What capability in laundering and in nursing babies through the measles , without the slightest previous experience !

		How has she concealed these traits till the ripe age of thirty-six , and imposed upon the world as a fastidious , self-centred , exacting bachelor-maid ?

		How does it happen that in her village is hidden away a young author of equally buoyant and lovable disposition , which he has concealed with no less success throughout some eight lustra ?

		How does any family so loyal , so amusing , so industrious as the Flaggs happen to be so ill-provided with this world 's goods ?

		The characters in this `` irresistible novel of happiness '' have not the defects of their qualities .

		They never commit faults , though they may bravely undergo misfor - tunes .

		It is really a very funny book .

		From a random passage of twenty-three lines we extract these characteristic words : `` mystery , '' `` precious , '' `` sweet , '' `` soft , '' `` kiss , '' `` empty , '' `` guess , '' `` delighted , '' `` seldom , '' `` little , '' `` wonderful , '' `` ecstasy . ''

		The scene is one in which

		Bodbank is an
Illinois	LOCATION	town on the banks of the

		It may be added that we were not a little startled at meeting Mr.

Vistula	LOCATION	.

		But there is no doubt that he is equally at home here , in the back room of the

		Only during the Thirty Years ' War was there an actual depopulation of
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Her losses in officers were not proportionately heavy .


France	LOCATION	lost more officers in eleven years than
Austria	LOCATION	in three hundred .

		In the second section of the volume , Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	marshals his facts to expose the dysgenic effects of war in mili - tary selection , which exposes the strongest and sturdiest young men to destruction and for the most part leaves the weaklings to per - petuate the race .

		He cites statistics to prove an actual measurable , physical deterioration in stature in
France	LOCATION	due apparently to mil - itary selection .

		The system of determining military fitness results in the return of weak - lings to the civil population and the with - drawal of the physically fit therefrom and their exposure to a higher rate of destruction by disease in barracks and camp as well as by the accidents of war .

		To these dysgenic aspects of militarism the author adds the appalling racial deterioration resulting from venereal diseases , which , as statistics indicate , tend to become abnormally prevalent among regular soldiers as compared with new recruits .

		The work is a candid and sane discussion of both sides of this very impor - tant aspect of militarism .

		The stage as a career .

		Mr.
Arthur Hornblow	PERSON	's '' Train - ing for the Stage '' -LRB-
Lippincott	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- is an attractively written book of short , informal essays on such topics as `` The Player To-day , '' `` The Art of the Actor , '' `` The Stage as a Career for Women , '' `` What an Actor Earns , '' `` Some Do n'ts , '' etc. .

		Its author contrasts the average young actor of to-day , who is frankly commercial , complacently ignorant of the history and traditions of the stage , and often disdainful of `` highbrow stuff , '' with the actors of another and less commercial era and the prodigious amount of study done by them ``
Henry Irving	PERSON	impersonated no fewer than four hundred and twenty-eight characters during his first three years on the stage . ''

		He asserts that managers exploit the actor 's own individuality instead of insisting on his `` getting under the skin of the person he is supposed to be impersonating and submerging his identity completely in that of the assumed character , which , after all , is the very essence of the art of acting . ''

		He says that the art of elocution is neglected , and that `` inarticula - tion is the besetting sin of the present-day stage , '' and is of the opinion that `` one or two years ' preliminary study in a good school of acting is unquestionably the best and quickest way to gain a foothold on the stage . ''

		He blames the audience as well as the actor and the manager , for `` it is indeed a question if the present generation of theatregoers knows what good acting is . ''

		He writes inter - estingly of stage conditions not generally known of actors ' salaries , of the actor 's voice , of contracts , etc. .

		He estimates that ` there are to-day in this country 40,000 per - sons engaged in theatricals , 50 per cent at least of whom are legitimate actors , '' and that during
1915	DATE	no fewer than 10,000 applied to the Actors ' Fund for relief `` on the plea that the wolf was at the door and that they needed immediate pecuniary assistance . ''

		It is the purpose of `` Training for the Stage '' `` to discourage a few of the hundreds of well - intentioned but misguided young people who , having no talent for the stage .

		.

		rush into a career for which they are manifestly unfitted , '' and also to encourage real ability and to `` spur on to renewed effort those in 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	whom the call to the boards is irresistible . ''

		Its author stands for the ideal , and has con - tributed to the profession an honest , straight - forward , readable book , if one that does not go so deeply into the subject as many readers will desire and expect .

		Mr.
David Belasco	PERSON	, whose portrait appears as the frontispiece , writes a `` Foreword , '' in which temperament is insisted upon as `` the first word , and the last , in acting . ''

		saints ' legends The student of literary history , in English the lover of religious art , and the student of folk-lore will all profit by reading Professor
Gordon Hall Gerould	PERSON	's `` Saints ' Legends , '' the latest addi - tion to Professor
Neilson	PERSON	's `` Types of English Literature '' series -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Professor
Gerould	PERSON	has given a succinct and carefully documented account of the sub - stance , style , origin , and author -LRB- where the author is known -RRB- , of every important legend and group of legends produced in
England	LOCATION	from
St. Hilda	LOCATION	's day to the Reformation , and from the dawn of the Catholic revival in the eighteenth century to the present , the whole preceded by two introductory chapters on the origin and character of saints ' legends in general .

		To cover so wide a field in less than four hundred pages calls for extreme com - pression and the almost complete avoidance of illustration , qualities that are not likely to attract the general reader .

		Moreover , the legends themselves , for the most part , have little charm of style , though Professor
Gerould	PERSON	quite properly remarks of one of the collections that it is not more contemptible than much of the writing that modern taste finds tolerable .

		But it is evident that few of the writers had the skill to give adequate expression to the poetry , the devoutness , and the moral truth which are the notes of the Christian mythology .

		It is no doubt for this reason that Professor
Gerould	PERSON	's treatment lacks the `` unction '' to use a dubious word which one looks for in a book on this sub - ject , though his glowing praise of Chaucer 's
St. Cecilia	LOCATION	is proof that he does not at heart belong to that school of critics whom he aptly describes as `` wiser in Chaucerian than in saintly lore , '' `` in textual criticism than in humanity . ''

		The motto of such a book as this might well be the superscription of the legend of St.
Christopher	PERSON	in the
Thornton MS.	LOCATION	: `` To the heryng or the redyng of the whilke storye langes grete mede , and it be done with devo - cione . ''

		The story is indeed a fascinating one .

		The humanity of these tales , however ill expressed , their childlike credulity , their inarticulate mysticism , their kinship with tales far more ancient for example , the resemblance of the legend of
St. Julian the Hospitaller	ORGANIZATION	to the story of Oedipus these are traits that can not but appeal , in Lord
Morley	PERSON	's fine phrase , to `` one who through books explores the strange voyages of man 's moral reason . ''

		To these must be added their essential truth , however slight their histor - ical foundation .

		`` A saint , '' says
Count de Maistre	ORGANIZATION	, `` had a vision in which he saw Satan standing before the throne of God .

		And .

		.

		he heard the evil spirit say : ` Why hast Thou damned me who have offended Thee only once , while thousands of men who have offended Thee many times Thou dost save ? '

		God answered him : ` Hast thou once asked pardon ? '

		There is the Christian mythology !!

		There is dramatic truth , which has its value and its effect independently of the literall truth , and which would even gain nothing : from it .

		What matters it whether the saint , heard or did not hear the sublime word that I have quoted ?

		The great thing is to know that forgiveness is refused only to him who has not asked it . ''

		The first great Wh ls therG am0n g th S6 English prose read at all who has not read `` Robinson Crusoe '' ?

		And who among readers generally knows anything about the creator of that household classic further than that his name was
Defoe	PERSON	?

		Yet
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	was not only the most volumin - ous English writer of his generation , but he was also one of the most gifted .

		In quantity and variety perhaps even in quality of pro- duction , he was apparently unrivalled , says Professor
William P. Trent	PERSON	, in his book entitled `` Defoe : How to Know Him '' -LRB- Bobbs -
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		In more particular terms he says again : He was `` rather the keenest observer of his day , the most intelligent , alert , and well paid of the prime minister 's secret agents , and the most accomplished journalist
England	LOCATION	had produced , perhaps the most remarkable the world has ever seen . ''

		It is the journalistic quality in
Defoe	LOCATION	's work that Professor Trent first emphasizes .

		Had
Defoe	PERSON	not developed his extraordinary talent as a journalist , he might never have become what he certainly was , the first great English master in the field of realistic prose fiction .

		No man of letters in our knowledge has shown a greater propensity to use his pen .

		He dis - cussed practically every subject that made its appeal to the intelligent interest of his time , and he brought an independent and fearless intelligence into its discussion .

		He
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 403 was obviously impelled by a vital purpose to contribute honestly to the enlightenment and progress of society , and in many of his arti - cles he proves to have been in advance of his age .

		He was an industrious pamphleteer , an indefatigable writer of political papers , an essayist on economic and sociological subjects , a controversialist on religious questions , a moralist , an historian , a writer of books of travel , a student of the natural , the super - natural , and the occult , a novelist , a ballad - ist , and a satirist in verse .

		Like De Quincey , he worked in many fields , and was remark - able not only for the variety of his investiga - tions but equally so for the breadth and quality of his information , his sense of detail , and his grasp on facts .

		Defoe 's career as a journalist and secret agent in the service of both Whig and Tory governments is a complicated and confusing story ; in Profes - sor
Trent	ORGANIZATION	's pages it is made as clear , prob - ably , as it can be .

		Of the moral effect of
Defoe	PERSON	's employment upon his own character , and of the reaction upon his nature of the misfortunes and injustice he encountered , his biographer speaks frankly and without flat - tery .

		In the later chapters , dealing with
Defoe	PERSON	's work as a novelist , we find an excel - lent discussion of his place in the development of English fiction .

		Dr.
Trent	PERSON	is emphatic in his recognition of
Defoe	PERSON	's high service in the field of realistic creative art .

		Incidentally he notes that in
1720	DATE	the journalist formed a connection with
Applebee	ORGANIZATION	, a publisher who specialized in the `` confessions '' of noted criminals , a fact which throws additional light upon
Defoe	PERSON	's familiarity with the pic - turesque material utilized in his sketch of
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	and in the more important narratives , ``
Moll Flanders	PERSON	, '' `` Colonel
Jack	PERSON	, '' and ``
Roxana	PERSON	. ''

		Another interesting point made by this biographer is that the journalist was released from his imprisonment some months previous to the first issue of the `` Review '' ; and thus he disposes authorita - tively of the old legend that this famous little periodical was edited within prison walls .

		Following the peculiar and admirable plan of the series in which it appears , this volume contains copious selections from the author 's various works ; and these assist greatly in the interpretative purpose of the book .

		Defoe is not an easy man to know , a `` human chameleon '' the biographer once denominates him ; but a long and patient following of his elusive personality has quali - fied Professor Trent better , perhaps , than any other to explain him to us .

		Essays of a. contented woman .

		In a late collection of essays Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	refers rather contemptuously to the class of literature within which his own book falls as '' those daisy-chains of commonplace reflec - tions . ''

		But commonplaceness has its uses .

		We do not always wish to be startled or thrilled , shocked or entranced or enraptured ; and so the mild titillation of the gently humor - ous , not too deeply reflective essay is often just the sort of intellectual stimulus we need .

		Harmless recreation of this kind is furnished by Mrs.
Lillian Hart Tryon	PERSON	in a round dozen ; of bright and amusing pieces , not new to print , but new in their present attractive book-form .

		`` Speaking of Home '' is their col - lective title , and they further announce them - : selves as the `` essays of a contented woman . ''

		Housekeeping is a fine art and not a coarse drudgery in this writer 's opinion , and though she refrains from quoting
George Herbert	PERSON	's familiar quatrain , she evidently finds some - | thing of divinity in the daily round and com - mon task of the housewife .

		She writes about the passing of the parlor , the momentous busi - ness of jelly - making , the homely comfort of shabbiness , the pleasures of piazza conversa - tion , ragbags and relics , on being a hostess , !

		on buying at the ^ oor , and so on , with ready pen and a knack of hitting on the not too trite , the not too commonplace .

		In fact , she achieves originality in many of her observations , as where she develops the seemingly unpromising theme , `` On Keeping House by Ear . ''

		Nor does she shrink from challenging dispute , as in her assertion that `` every woman has a horror of social debt . ''

		Surely , the easy-going social debtor of the writer 's sex is far from being unknown .

		If Mrs.
Tryon	PERSON	is as good a housekeeper as she is a writer , hers is a fortu - nate family .

		a German character ^ * .

		The chie ^ P oints which Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	makes in his ^ ^ ^ 3 called The NemCSlS of Docility : A Study of German Character '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- are , first , that docility , when it is a national characteristic , may become a destructive force of extreme violence ; and , secondly , that a docile majority implies a dogmatic and domineering minority .

		Both of these conditions the author finds exempli - fied in present-day
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He believes , no doubt correctly enough , that docility as a German characteristic is not racial but is rather a product of the age-long period of the country 's division and political impotence .

		It should be noted that the author through - out the book uses the word `` docility '' in a 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 16	DATE	disparaging sense , defining it as `` readiness to obey for the sake of obeying , avidity for commands and instructions , reluctance to accept responsibility or exercise initiative , inability to react against the pressure of auto - cratic authority . ''

		But `` docility '' may also connote a teachable and law-abiding disposi - tion , in which case it becomes a term of at least partial commendation .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	, by following the one line of meaning and neglect - ing the other , has drawn a rather distorted picture .

		A
Germany	LOCATION	docile only in the bad sense , such as he delineates it , would have been able neither to pursue the arts of peace with such conspicuous success nor to make her present stubborn stand in war .

Margaret Fuller	PERSON	writes the story of the boyhood of
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	under the title , `` A New England Childhood '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Miss Fuller 's family were neighbors and friends of the Stedmans at
Norwich Town	LOCATION	, and she herself attracted the attention and won the praise of the poet-critic by her early verses though of this latter fact she modestly says nothing in her book .

		With such opportunities for first-hand information , she has been able to give on the authority of family tradition many anecdotes of
Edmund Stedman	PERSON	's early years .

		The strict student may regret that some of these have evidently been embellished with imaginary detail ; but the book is written for the general reader , and it succeeds in giving a more vivid and more interesting picture than is to be gained from the bulky `` Life and Letters . ''

		The future poet appears as no prodigy , but as a very natural , original , lovable boy .

		It may be from a sense of loyalty and a disinclination to gossip that Miss Fuller is less satisfactory in her portrayal of the mother , who seems almost to have abandoned her gifted son with - out perceptible regret .

		A doctor of divinity 's human side .

		Of the late
William Newton Clarke	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, his biographer , Mrs.
Clarke	PERSON	, says in recalling his personal characteristics : `` His innate vein of drollery found vent in various small ways .

		At one time he liked to make ` Angular Saxons , ' following out an idea found in the life of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		He could not draw a picture of anything , but as he sat , pen in hand , at his table , he would rapidly sketch a series of laughable little impish figures in the most expressive attitudes . ''

		To readers of to-day Dr.
Clarke	PERSON	is best known for his `` Outline of Christian Theology '' not so for - biddingly doctrinal in tone as its title might indicate and his `` Sixty Years with the Bible . ''

		These and others of his books , the fruit of a rich personal experience in the things of religion , engage even the random reader 's attention to a remarkable degree .

		In pulpit and parish , as well as later in a theo - logical professorship , the writer worked out in his own life and thought the great funda - mental truths that find such impressive utter - ance in his lectures and books .

		Born of old
New England	LOCATION	ancestry and in the Puritan traditions , he was reared and educated at

WILLIAM McFEE	PERSON	Author of a novel that has caused more favorable comment than any other book published this
fall	DATE	.

		CASUALS OF THE SEA Some Press Comments : There is a reality about it alL Mr.
McFee	PERSON	's characters live , move , and have being .

		They are not mere puppets .

		The story is , indeed , a slice of life and the author is to be reckoned with .

		It would seem that he is destined to become a real force in English fiction .


San Francisco Bulletin	LOCATION	.

		An unusual and an arresting book .

		He unques - tionably belongs to that small company made up of writers who command respect .

		The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	.

		A reading of only the first few pages of `` Casuals of the Sea '' is essential to a realiza - tion of the fact that we have in it a novel worth careful contemplation and a novelist of an assured future .


Boston Evening Tran	ORGANIZATION	- script .

		`` Casuals of the Sea '' is sure to be one of the year 's biggest books .

		It is a genuinely truthful book in every scene , every motion , every slightest experience , ashore and on sea , which it describes .


New York Evening	ORGANIZATION	Sun .

		`` Casuals of the Sea '' is a remarkable book , and
William McFee	PERSON	having gone to school to many good masters , has trained and fully equipped a talent which is his own and which promises to win him a place in the long suc - cession of English fiction .


New York	LOCATION	Trib - une .

		What I relish most is the general tone of the thing .

		Mr.
McFee	PERSON	is just as interesting to me when he writes about advertising as when he writes of the sea , perhaps more .

		It is his quality that is really the thing .

		The DiaL One of the most interesting books I have ever read .

		Thers is revealed in the telling of this story a quality of mind which is so new in literature that there are no terms as yet invented by which to describe it .

		It is at the farthest remove from the sentimentalises of the Victorian period ; but it is just as English an English coolness a complete imperturb - ableness in the face of life .

		Certainly this book is one of the events of the literary year .

		The Masses .

		The author of `` Casuals of the Sea '' has experience , vision , personality , and perspective .

		He has known life at first hand ; has digested his knowledge in solitude -LRB- he is a ship 's engineer -RRB- ; and his book is more than a good story , it is a sharing with us of the hoarded comprehensions of a lifetime .

		CICERO : His Life and Works By
HANNIS TAYLOR CICERO	PERSON	was the embodiment of the Spirit of Roman Republicanism .

		In his life is epitomized the history of Roman public life at its best , and when , after having essayed the impossible task of saving the Eepublic through a social , moral , and political regeneration of the governing classes , he went down in the wreck of the commonwealth , Roman constitutional gov - ernment lost its ablest advocate and defender .

		This account of his life and time should appeal with peculiar force to the American people , embodying as it does a record of conditions so nearly identical with our own .

November 30	DATE	MODERN DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS
November 24 , 1916	DATE	To the bookstalls this a. m. , where I discovered a book which I did peruse with great delight .

		To my extraordinary content , I found that the Memoirs of
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	have been deemed of sufficient excellence to receive attention in this time of unusual haste .

		Nor did I fully recall until this modern scholar had brought it to my atten - tion , how regular was my attendance at the theatres of the day , how wide my acquaintance among the actors -LRB- and to my delight , I may add , among the actresses -RRB- of the time and how general my familiarity with the dramas .

		Moreover , this scholar has executed a surprisingly good plan , and with orig - inality .

		-LRB- To my greater astonishment , to be accounted for by the progress among women in these modern days , I find it to be the work of a lady . -RRB-

		Not only has she culled out all that relates to plays from my great Memoirs , but added to this she has made notations , footnoted to my work from like sayings of
Downes	LOCATION	,
Langbaine	LOCATION	, and
John Evelyn	PERSON	.

		-LRB- I may add they gain nothing from proximity to my more enlivening remarks . -RRB-

		But , be that as it may , this new work appeals to me .

		It is no task to read in fact it stimulates to further reading ; yet no one can accuse it of any lack of scholarship .

		I may add that the prints are excellently chosen , though methinks the portrait of
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	does not do her justice .


November 25 , 1916	DATE	All the morning at the bookstalls to scan those volumes which I did not sufficiently peruse yesterday .

		Another book on the drama liked me well .

		One
Loomis Havemeyer	PERSON	has considered the performances of savage peoples .

		It is droll enough to read of the variety of their ceremonies .

		Moreover , the work of another lady pleased me heartily .

		For recalling with what a diversity of meanings is the word criticism employed in literature whether concerning the affairs of Shelley or the markings of disapproval made by a teacher on a pupil 's exercise there is need for clarity .

		Miss
Gertrude Buck	PERSON	, whom I discover to be one of the faculty of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	upon the

		The romance of
Joseph Pels	PERSON	' life work is told by his widow who was his inspiration , and who is the inspiring genius of the agencies carrying on the work he began .

		In a narrative having the progressive interest of a novel and the informing value of a treatise on current modern history , Mrs.
Fels	PERSON	relates how her husband 's philanthropic endeavors , moving at first along the more conventional lines of charity , were , through a logical evolution , consecrated to the nobler object of making charity , in its present sense , unnecessary .

		Mr.
Fels	PERSON	became a single taxer , not because he wanted to reform fiscal methods , but because he gradually learned to understand that the general property tax , and the system of private land monopoly which it implies , are throttling humanity and raising up the most monstrous injustice the world has ever seen .

		487 `` THE EMERALD WAY '' If you were going out on that muddy khaki way which is so weary and racking and , worst of all , so monotonous , what book or books would you take with you , as a reminder of that serene beauty now hidden in the dust - cloud of war ?

		Perhaps that question has a ring of the `` What is your favorite poet ? ''

		about it , but not entirely so .

		For in these bitter circum - stances you get a real `` preference , '' not a conventional taste .

		And in modern literature we do not want Boileauesque standards , we want a man 's own `` preference '' the word in its present sense is taken from
Paul Escombe	PERSON	which will give us a fresh view of some known and loved book or a revelation of an unknown beauty .


Eugene Demolder	PERSON	is not a famous author , and `` La Route d'Emeraude '' is about as old - fashioned to a Parisian as `` John Inglesant '' is to us .

		Yet that was the book which gave back to me something of lost peace and beauty during my first laborious weeks of soldiering that tedious , awful process known as `` breaking in '' a recruit .

		It was so hard to decide what to take when there were so many one wanted to take and so few allowed !

		It was desperately sad to put away one 's choice
Aldine	PERSON	's , with their white crisp paper and running type , one 's `` Griffin '' classics and Plantine and Venetian and Florentine books that Boetius picked up for a soldo outside
Santa Maria Novella	LOCATION	, that massive unreadable folio lugged home in dust and sweat from the East End of
London	LOCATION	, but precious because a `` Froben of
Basle	LOCATION	'' not in the British Museum !

		And still harder to leave that neat little
Heine	PERSON	one was just beginning to understand and love , and last month 's new books from
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	pages uncut which perhaps some less loving fingers would tear , all the treasures of the book-maniac , which seem so trivial to
Army Councils	ORGANIZATION	and Sergeant Majors but which have This article was written for THE DIAL by Mr.
Aldington	PERSON	during a '' few hours
week-end	DATE	leave '' from the British camp where he is in training for service at the front .

		THE EDITOR .

		448 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	outlived the clamor and songs and violence of so many centuries .

		I chose for my books the poems of Catullus and
Herrick	PERSON	; a friend who joined with me took
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Anatole France	LOCATION	's `` Crime de
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, '' and -LRB- to read in the train -RRB- Demolder 's `` Route d'Emeraude . ''

		For the first week I forgot utterly and blankly that such a thing as a book out - side the red-covered drill books ever existed .

		And then I determined , in spite of everything , to snatch one hour from each day , to taste the honey of the Muses !

		Somehow
Herrick	PERSON	was too light and friv - olous , with his rose-wreaths and `` hayre drip - ping with oyle '' and his Antheas and Erinnas and drooping daffodils .

		Shakespeare was too lofty for one 's weary , cramped little soul .

		The glittering aristocratism of Catullus was almost an insult to a humble `` foot-slogger , '' and the delicate irony of
Anatole France	LOCATION	left one indifferent .

		And then , when I was beginning to despair , to think I had lost all love of books , I took down `` The Emerald Way . ''

		I read and re-read that book with the same avid , parched eagerness that a servant-maid , condemned to a lifetime of ignoble and unrec - ompensed toil , reads of the beautiful curly - haired Earl who married the housemaid in spite of Lady
Sybil Vere	PERSON	's intrigues !

		I understood what the novelette habit is .

		Not that `` The Emerald Way '' by any wild stretch of imagination could be called a novel - ette , but as I think of it I can recall no other `` image '' to express my absorbed interest .

		Hour after hour , all day , I tramped a dusty `` square '' under a blazing
July	DATE	sun , until my clothes hung soaked with sweat about me , until I thought I would scream if this monotonous torture lasted another minute .

		Everything seemed dead , arid , a monstrous insult to one 's intelligence , an insane and perverted rou - tine ... And then , in the evening , when the last table and pot and basin had been scoured and re-scoured , when the last buckle had been polished and the last strap greased , I would slip off to the baths and come back to my `` Emerald Way , '' refreshed like dusty grass after a shower .

		I would lie on my bed , between X , the journalist , and B , the tailor , and read ; through the window opposite was one plumy willow tree , motionless in the gold twilight .

		And the book I read was perhaps nothing very great in the annals of literature , as written by great and comfortable professors , but it kept my soul alive .

		It kept my soul alive with a thousand pictures , reminding of one phase and another of life I had quite forgotten .

		It gave me pictures of the flat Dutch lands , with their geometric dykes and rows of trees and ceaselessly fleeting sky ; it took me to old
Haarlem	LOCATION	and to old
Amster	PERSON	- dam and into quaint houses and mills , taverns and prostitutes ' haunts , fields and dunes and sea spaces ... It was as if I had been allowed each evening to wander round the Dutch and Flemish rooms of our
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a picture gallery in print .

		There were pictures of coarse men drunk to nausea in picturesque taverns by
Teniers	ORGANIZATION	; of kermesses by
Van Ostade	LOCATION	; of the glowing flesh tints of women 's bodies by
Rubens	LOCATION	; of melancholy and despised and poor and beau - tiful people by Rembrandt always the figure of Christ standing beside the despised person ; of sleepy cows in sunshine , by
Paul Potter	PERSON	; of neat girls in immaculate kitchens opening on to tiled and spotless passages , by
Pieter de Hoogh	PERSON	; of merchant ships , hung with gaudy streamers , becalmed off
Rotter	PERSON	- dam , by van der Cappelle ; of portly matrons and frizzly - haired young ladies in exquisite satins , yellow and crimson and cobalt , with frail laces , by
Gerard Dow	PERSON	; of wild and handsome young men , by
Franz Hals	PERSON	; and of dozens more , by
Breughel	PERSON	and
Jordaens	PERSON	and Cuyp ... Yes , `` The Emerald Way '' is not , perhaps , great literature , but it gave life and hope and refreshment to one weary , thirsty , timid soul !

		.

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		AN EDITORIAL WRITER ON `` COLLIERV believes that he has found in THE DIAL a hint of obscurantism .

		He expostulates with us gently for a supposed prejudice against free verse and pleads for a greater catholicity .

		For our part , we enjoyed the exhortation and find ourselves in agreement with the exhorter , but we are totally at a loss to understand why we should have served as a text for such a sermon .

		If the editorial writer will follow THE DIAL with a care which it will try to
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 justify , he will find there opinions of the greatest variety , even about the merits of free verse ; he will find , too , that some of those opinions have been contributed by such well - known opponents of free verse as Mr.
Richard Aldington	PERSON	and
Miss Amy Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		If there seems to be conflict , so much the better ; THE DIAL believes that conflict is stimulating and is quite willing to leave easy judgments as to what is or is not true poetry to the pundits who have been able to find or to borrow a touchstone .

		In the meantime , having no such infallible mineral at hand , THE DIAL will try to reflect the best contemporary opinions available ; it will not expect its contributors to divine and express the opinions of the editors , however weighty it may privately hold those notions to be .

		ONE OP THE FIRST SLAVIC WRITERS TO BE READ IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	,
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, whose death in
Vevey	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, has just been made known , was more famous for one of his lesser works than for what critics have con - sidered were his best efforts .

		To the Amer - ican popular mind
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	is represented by `` Quo Vadis '' ; whereas , in his native
Poland	LOCATION	, in
Eussia	LOCATION	, in most of
Europe	LOCATION	, his novels dealing with the Polish-Cossack-Tatar conflicts of the fifteenth century are conceded to be among the most brilliant examples of modern historical novels .

		Of an ancient Lithuanian family that had removed to
Poland	LOCATION	because of the Russian wars ,
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	was born in `` Wola Okrzejska ,
Government of Siedlce	ORGANIZATION	, in
1846	DATE	.

		After attending the
Realgymnasium and University of Warsaw	ORGANIZATION	, he made his literary debut in
1872	DATE	with the humorous story , `` Nobody Is a Prophet in His Own Country . ''

		In
1876	DATE	he came to the
United States	LOCATION	, confining his visit for the most part to the Polish colony which the Modjeskis had just founded on the Californian coast .

		At this time , under the pseudonym `` Litwos , '' he wrote a series of letters to the `` Polish Gazette '' of
Warsaw	LOCATION	describing his impressions of
America	LOCATION	and its people .

		These letters did much to establish his fame at home .

		The drama `` On a Card '' -LRB-
1879	DATE	-RRB- and the stories `` Hanja '' and `` Yanko the Musician '' increased his popularity .

		In
1880	DATE	appeared his first historical novel , `` The Tatar Bondage , '' and in
1884	DATE	he completed the first of his great trilogy , `` With Fire and Sword , '' which was followed in
1886	DATE	by `` The Deluge , '' and in
1888	DATE	by `` Pan
Michael	PERSON	. ''

		In
America	LOCATION	he had met the great linguist ,
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	, and him
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	author - ized to translate the trilogy into English .

		The translations were excellent and were featured by the American publishers .

		They attained a certain vogue among a small group of readers , much as did
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's work in
England	LOCATION	, but they never became really popular .


Sienkiewicz	PERSON	felt the influences that were just beginning to prevail in literature the world over , and his later novels , `` With - out Dogma '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , and `` Children of the Soil '' -LRB- 1894 -RRB- , were pathological and psycho - logical in nature .

		In
1895	DATE	`` Quo Vadis , '' a story of Nero 's reign , appeared and was trans - lated into English .

		More than a million copies were sold in the
United States	LOCATION	.


Sienkiewicz	PERSON	returned to his old subject with `` Knights of the Cross '' -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- , and `` On the Field of Glory , '' the last book to be trans - lated by
Curtin	PERSON	before his death .


Sienkiewicz	PERSON	was prominent in relief work during the war and his activity along this line prevented his finishing another trilogy .

		His last published works are : `` Whirlpools , '' and `` In Desert and Wilderness , '' a story of
Africa	LOCATION	, in which continent he travelled in
1891	DATE	.


Sienkiewicz	PERSON	was an honorary member of the
Russian Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	and for many years edited the periodical `` Slowo '' -LRB- The World -RRB- .

		A SPLENDID BEQUEST TO A PUBLIC LIBRARY comes to notice in the addition of a million and a half dollars to the resources of the
Providence Public Library	ORGANIZATION	through the will of the late
Lyra Brown Nickerson	ORGANIZATION	.

		With so substantial an endowment a library already so well supported as that of
Providence	LOCATION	should be able to indulge its taste for special depart - ments and special activities with considerable freedom .

		Exactly how the increase in rev - enue will be used has not yet been decided , `` except that the underlying aim , '' it is announced in the `` Quarterly Bulletin '' of the library , `` will be to study the needs , inter - ests , and activities of the local community , in all their details . ''

		Of the benefactress and her father we learn from the same source the following : `` Her father , the late
Edward I. Nickerson	PERSON	, was a Trustee of the Library for thirty years , from
1878	DATE	until his death in
1908	DATE	, and was Secretary from
1884	DATE	to

		450 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	THE TRUTH ABOUT SHAKESPEARE lies so deep down , as Democritus said of truth in general , that one despairs of ever bringing it up into the clear light of day .

		`` Others abide our question .

		Thou art free . ''

		Nevertheless there are not wanting patient delvers who count a year of research well spent if it adds but a single item to our meagre store of knowledge about the man
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among these devoted toilers none deserves warmer praise than Professor
Charles William Wallace	PERSON	, of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, who , with his hardly less devoted wife , has for years been engaged in exploring the archives of
England	LOCATION	in quest of documents relating to
England	LOCATION	's foremost poet .

		More than five million original records , as the authoritative `` Who 's Who '' tells us , have been examined in this tremen - dous labor of disinterested scholarship by Mr. and Mrs.
Wallace	PERSON	.

		A very cursory exam - ination in most instances it must have been ; yet many references to Shakespeare were dis - covered , and more are confidently hoped for .

		But before finishing his self-imposed task and publishing his findings to the world , Professor
Wallace	PERSON	has consented to give in the form of lectures , to be delivered in this country , a foretaste of what is to come .

		The closing weeks of this Shakespeare tercentenary year and the opening months of the year following will be devoted to the proposed American lecture tour by this enthusiastic
Shakespear	PERSON	- ean , who has already given abundant proof , in printed form , of his ability to enliven and enrich his chosen theme .

		BOOKS FOR THE SHUT-IN should , of course , be of a nature to counteract the depressing and repressing influences of the reader 's nar - row quarters .

		When the shut-in person finds himself or herself separated from the outside world by barred windows , iron doors , and stone walls , the mind seeks the freedom to be found in the limitless land of make-believe .

		A recent `` List of Books for Prison Libraries , '' prepared by the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, is devoted wholly to fiction , other classes of lit - erature being reserved for future treatment .

		It is a good selection of wholesome tales and novels , such as anyone , bound or free , ought to enjoy .

		But if one glances over the titles in the imagined character of a convict , a few names will be found that may convey a humorous or whimsical suggestion .

		Would the average inmate of a penal institution be attracted or repelled by the title of
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's most famous romance ?

		Would he or would he not feel moved to read
E. F. Pollard	PERSON	's `` Liberty or Death '' ?

		And the next book , `` Pollyanna '' would the resolutely cheerful heroine succeed in making him join in the `` glad game '' of finding something to be glad about in any and all circumstances , including incarceration ?

		What would be the emotions excited by the title , `` Living with - out a Boss '' ?

		Would ``
Christopher Hibbault	PERSON	, Eoadmaker , '' appeal to the members of a gang breaking stones on the highway and clad in horizontally-striped apparel ?

		Well , these are perhaps only idle questions .

		ENGLISH MISCONCEPTIONS OF AMERICAN USAGE have generated both amusement and wrath from the time of Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	down to the latest Londoner who takes passage for
New York	LOCATION	, races westward as far as
Chicago	LOCATION	, and then goes home and writes us up .

		Here is an English writer 's representation of American book-advertising methods -LRB- from a late issue of `` M. A. B. '' -RRB- : `` A perusal of the following advertisement by an American publishing house shows at a glance how behindhand English publishers are in their methods of advertising : `` The Story with the Punch !

		The
Keal Goods	ORGANIZATION	!

		The Hot Stuff !

		All Pep from the Word Go ! ''

		Much more follows , emphasized to the eye with various devices known to the printer , but too glaring for this modest page .

		Some of the words , however , may be given , in print of decorous dimensions .

		For example : `` A Frontier Classic !

		The Real Goods !

		Written by a Master Hand .

		No mush , slush , or trash , but a stirring truthful record of the great cattle wars of the early 90 's .

		Everything clicks like a Colt 38 !

		Makes the European war seem tame and life in the trenches a pastoral of peace in comparison .

		All Aboard for the Wild and Woolly West !

		The Book You Need !

		The Book You Must Have !

		Buy It Now !

		!

		! ''

		No title is given , and the author 's name is represented by a dash .

		These omis - sions , with other particulars too obvious to mention , arouse suspicion as to the genuine - ness of this `` advertisement by an American publishing house . ''

		But if it amuses the Eng - lish reader in these dolorous times , why should we fret ?

		WHY is A BOOK-REVIEW ?

		This question has been asked by many readers and many writers , many book-buyers and many booksellers ; and the answer has more than once been briefly given in some such terms as these : A book - review , if worthy of the name , is designed to tell what the book is about , its merits and defects , and its proper place in its class .

		Some would insist , and librarians often do
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 insist , that the book 's more material qualities should also be appraised .

		In an article enti - tled `` The Failure of Book Reviewing , '' included in Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	's lately published `` Libraries : Addresses and Essays , '' he complains that reviewers , in discussing a ' .

		.

		book , `` withhold information as to the paper | on which it is printed , whether it is cheap wood pulp which will not stand three weeks ' honest wear , or heavily coated with clay , and j therefore helpless against even the quiet turn - -LSB- ing of its leaves , or made on honor and planned for a decent lifetime of usefulness .

		!

		They do not tell us if it is bound in a thorough , ; workmanlike way , or is thrown together with j just enough glue to keep it in shape until it I is sold .

		The type , the ink , the index , the i margins , the page illustrations these things ; they say nothing about .

		And to the library they are very important , and especially to the expense side of its accounts in new copies , repairs and binding . ''

		These are hints that deserve some heed on the part of the reviewer who would justify his ways to men .

		A STIMULANT TO THE READING HABIT IS unquestionably found in the enforced leisure of an involuntary sojourn within the walls of a reformatory or prison or other house of detention for the mentally , morally , or phys - ically defective .

		At the recent
National Conference of Charities and Correction	ORGANIZATION	, in
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, there were presented certain statistics of significance , from which it ap - pears that the average public library 's book circulation is less than half of that reported by the average prison or similar institution .

		The figures deal with the number of times each volume in the collection is drawn by a reader , and the number of volumes read in one year by the average reader .

		If a public library has an annual circulation amounting to three issues for each volume in its collec - tion , and to fifteen volumes a year for each registered card-holder , it is enjoying an aver - age activity ; but a house of detention com - monly shows double this interest in books if it has a well-selected and well-managed library .

		Perhaps these statements are based on data not comprehensive enough for the most trust - worthy generalization , but it is interesting to note the appreciation shown for wholesome literature by the unfortunate victims of un - wholesome influences and predispositions .

		This fact may be brought to notice without serving as an incentive to qualify for admis - sion into the : , till air of delightful studies behind iron bars .

		MAGAZINE VERSE OP
1916	DATE	shows that our poets have not been content with marking time : they have been pushing forward , though the conservatives , the traditionalists , among their critics might not regard this forward movement as at the same time an upward movement .

		In his yearly review of our periodical poetry Mr.
William Stanley Braith	PERSON	- waite writes , in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' that `` the whole average of the magazine poetry of the year is higher , '' and further : `` I have found in my examination of the magazines of the past year that a freer movement has taken place all through our poetry .

		There is less of the strict conventional regularity , which does not mean that the traditional patterns of verse have been abandoned , but that the poets are using rhythm with more flexibility . ''

		Some inscrutable connection he believes to exist between war and literary productivity , and he cites the literary epoch of
Cooper	PERSON	and Irving as belonging to the Revolution , that of
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	as synchronizing with the Civil War .

		An unmistakable influ - ence , whether good or bad , war must exert upon literature ; but both
Cooper	PERSON	and
Irving	PERSON	were born after the close of our revolutionary conflict and wrote their books in a time of peace ; and
Emerson	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	had given ample proofs of their genius years before the rupture between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's yearly anthology of the verse here referred to is announced for
November	DATE	publication .

		Though marked with the year
1916	DATE	, it can , of course , take no account of the
last two months of the year	DATE	.

		As usual , he prints a number of the choicer poems in connection with his newspaper review ; and it is significant that , of the five thus distinguished , only one , the last , is regular in rhythm and faultless in rhyme .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		COLLEGE AND CONVERSATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Bring together a group of college men , gradu - ates of the same institution but not close friends there , and what do they talk about ?

		The same things as the Tired Business Man of ` theatrical dis - repute : sport or women , business or politics in the littlest possible sense of the word .

		They share no intellectual interests unless , perchance , they hap - pen to be victims of the same profession , in which case their common interest lies in the law , or in medicine , or some such fascination .

		With the extension of the elective system at American col - leges , there has come into being a generation of college graduates who are as likely as not to be 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	equally ignorant of the classics and of mathematics beyond algebra and plane geometry ; who have little or no concept of the rudiments of any science but who have , it may be , concentrated upon some embryonic subject , like the `` science '' of economics : a branch described by highbrows as of dubious cultural value and profanely mentioned by such lowbrows as the business men who earn their own livings as being of equally negative practical worth to anyone except future teachers of the same `` science '' in some quite unpractical university .

		What has set me off , indeed , on these somewhat fulminant vaporings , is a certain article by Presi - dent
Lowell of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		President
Lowell	PERSON	has in the past reacted most admirably against such exploded -LRB- or exploding -RRB- educational theories as Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's thought that it does n't matter at all what or by what plan an immature `` student '' shapes the foundations of his intellectual life .

		And yet in a most respected review the always respectable President
Lowell	PERSON	, writing of `` Culture , '' falls a vic - time to the old , easy-going , all-too-familiar opti - mism that is the intellectual curse of our
United States	LOCATION	.

		It would not do to say it out loud that a large proportion of our college graduates are unlettered , unlicked cubs , with little to distinguish them from the Arrow-Collar boys of the street car advertisements save a certain social assurance bred of expensive associations .

		Hence we have this sort of .

		thing from President
Lowell	PERSON	: Culture ... does not mean the possession of a body of knowledge common to all educated men , for there is no such thing today .

		It denotes rather an attitude of mind than a specific amount of informa - tion .

		It implies enjoyment of things that the world has agreed are beautiful ; interest in the knowledge that mankind has found valuable ; comprehension of the principles that the race has accepted as true .

		Part of this is truism and the rest of it but no , I must not use that word here .

		`` A country without conversation , '' was a philosopher 's word - picture of
America	LOCATION	, painted for
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	when that fiery young poet set out on his world - travels , something more than two years since .

		And that is a pretty comprehensive damnation of us and our civilization , if we accept
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	's dictum that `` The ends of education are three : to develop the moral nature , to train the judgment , and to furnish material for conversation . ''

		Presi - dent
Lowell	PERSON	, for his part , confesses that the reason `` so large a part of general conversation in
America	LOCATION	relates to the weather , to politics , and to sport , is not so much because these things are intrinsically more interesting or valuable than in other coun - tries , as because they are among the few subjects that everyone is familiar with and can talk about , '' This describes most college men as well as most self-made merchants .

		We have evolved that comic terror , the newspaper interview , but we have lost the knack of conversation if we ever had it .

		And mere questions and answers never did make conversation .

		`` Questioning , '' said Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	again , `` is not the mode of conversation among gentlemen . ''

		Just as we need satire in our litera - ture we who have so far developed only two respectable satirists ,
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and `` Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' we need realism in our criticism , realism in our approach to practical teaching in
America	LOCATION	.

		With frankness there might be some hope for us .

		That is why we need fewer apologies and an outspoken confession that `` culture '' -LRB- what - ever it really is -RRB- is a state which no American , except an occasional Bostonian of the flesh or the spirit , even wants to attain .

		THE USE OF `` LIKE '' AND `` AS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In this heroic age of college and university English `` as she is spoke , '' when `` doctors '' who teach the tongue of Chaucer and Shakespeare `` dis - agree '' more or less in their practice , happy is the man who not only `` minds his p 's and q 's , '' but who equitably adjusts his `` woulds '' and `` shoulds '' to the mood and shade of significance he means or should mean .

		Thrice happy he who can render `` like '' and `` as '' in his parlance with due signifi - cance and propriety , and never get either askew .

		To do this he may have to escape some heredity , environment , and provincialism perhaps , and to be on his guard lest even some cheap dictionary waver from its orthodoxy .

		A fine test line for exhibiting the approved fashion of this usage is the fourth line of
Browning	PERSON	's dashing ``
Herve Riel	PERSON	. ''

		The poem opens thus : On the sea and at the
Hogue	PERSON	, sixteen hundred ninety-two , Did the English fight the French , woe to
France	LOCATION	!

		And , the thirty-first of
May	DATE	, helter-skelter through the blue , Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue .

		Came crowding ship on ship to Saint Molo on the
Ranee	PERSON	, With the English fleet in view .

		On first superficial view it looks for a moment as if
Browning	PERSON	himself had perpetrated the com - mon slip of making `` like '' do duty as a conjunc - tive adverb .

		But when you reflect , and inquire whether porpoises are in the habit of pursuing sharks , or sharks of pursuing porpoises , it soon comes to light that
Browning	PERSON	's structure is inverted .

		The sharks are in evident chase ; the rhythmically suppressed `` which '' before the words `` a shoal of sharks pursue , '' emerges to one 's sense , and
Browning	PERSON	's `` like '' is vindicated as the right adjective kind .

		If he meant to have had the por - poises pursue the sharks an anomaly of nature - faking or an unheard-of type of some vindic - tive millennium he would have said `` as , '' not `` like . ''

		The sharks are plainly on the war path , as `` the English fight the French '' this time .

		The only odd quirk about it is that , for rhyme 's sake , the poet must needs utilize `` a shoal of sharks '' as a plural noun governing `` pursue . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 453 ix SHAKESPEARE 'S TIME .

		* So long ago as
1905	DATE	, Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, now
Merton Professor of English Literature	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, sketched the plan of an encyclopaedic work on the
England of Queen Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	and of
King James	LOCATION	the First .

		In
1909	DATE	, Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	undertook its pro- duction , and arranged for the writing of most of the treatises , by separate and highly expert hands .

		Circumstances prevented him from completing the work he had thus begun ; and the war delayed the progress of it in other hands .

		It has finally been brought to com - pletion by Mr.
C. T. Onions	PERSON	, joint editor of the `` Oxford English Dictionary , '' and author of `` The Shakespeare Glossary . ''

		The delays in the process of its making , rather than design , have brought it to the light in the ter - centenary year of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		This accident may be held happy .

		Not only in bulk , but in both substance and aspect , the book is monumental .

		It is admirably printed , copiously indexed , and contains besides twO frontispieces in photogravure no less than one hundred and ninety-five illustrations selected with judgment and well executed .

		Its thirty chapters deal with the
Age of Elizabeth , Religion	ORGANIZATION	, the Court , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, Voy - ages and Explorations , Land Travel , Educa - tion , Scholarship , Hand-writing ,
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	and Coinage , Agriculture and Gardening , Law , Medicine , the Sciences , Folklore and Superstitions , the Fine Arts ,
Heraldry	ORGANIZATION	, Cos - tume , the Home ,
London	LOCATION	and the Life of the Town , Authors and Patrons , Booksellers , Actors and Acting , the
Playhouse	ORGANIZATION	, the Masque , Sports and Pastimes , Rogues and Vagabonds , Ballads and Broadsides , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's English .

		Four of these chapters are subdi - vided into sections where different phases of the general subject are treated by separate experts .

		Not a line of the whole but is written by a man who has mastered the topic on which he writes .

		Sir
John Sandys	PERSON	, for example , writes on Education and on Scholarship ; Pro- fessor
Firth	PERSON	on Ballads and Broadsides ; to mention more names would be either to cata - logue all or to feel guilty of invidious distinc - tions .

		and of world-tumult the eldest of English uni - versities should peacefully celebrate the three - hundredth anniversary of the greatest of English poets by giving the world this impres - sive collection of tributes to his deathless memory .

		For throughout these hundreds of pages there is hardly one where Shakespeare him - self does not hover near not the elusive man , concerning whom these expert writers here trouble themselves little , but the poet whose words have long since become , in their wisdom and their music alike , no small part of the spirit of English and indeed of human posterity .

		The first of the three indexes which supplement the book contains twelve three - column pages of reference to `` Passages Cited from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works . ''

		Turn to any of these references at random , and you will surely feel that it implies in the writer who made it an understanding at once acute and sympathetic of the poet ; almost always , too , you will feel a happy surprise in the new light thrown by the critic 's expert knowledge on some dimming aspect of what words and the world meant three hundred years ago .

		This phase of the book is perhaps its most commendable feature .

		You can not turn its pages without renewed and growing wonder at the freshness of perception and of expres - sion throughout
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		What seemed conventions or idioms again and again wake into living realities .

		Even though some of these comments and interpretations may occasionally seem far-fetched or debatable or indeed mistaken , the hundreds which surely illuminate make dispute impertinent .

		Who - ever , having just read any of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , will have recourse to this index of cited passages , and compare with the text the com - ments thus called to his attention , can not fail to find radiances of meaning unsuspected before .

		This amounts to saying , and saying cheer - fully , that the things of value to be found in these two volumes are countless .

		And yet it would be hard to find anywhere an equal num - ber of pages in total effect more bafflingly unsatisfactory .

		From such a purpose as ani - mates the book one might fairly have expected at least an approach to a result memorably definite .

		There are chapters and books else - where in existence , though unhappily these are not many , which you can not read without coming to feel and thus deeply to know what human life was like in other aspects than those actually about us .

		Macaulay 's chapter 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	on
England	LOCATION	in
1685	DATE	, for example , or the opening and the closing passages of
Henry Adams	PERSON	's `` History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' or
Taine	PERSON	's `` Old Regime , '' or
Adams	PERSON	's incom - parable `` Mont St.
Michel	PERSON	and
Chartres	LOCATION	, '' may perhaps be variously accurate in detail ; all alike and any of us can doubtless think of other names to add to the list leave one enlightened as one might be by eager travel ; and it is only by means of books that one can travel in time as distinguished from space .

		There is no past time wherein English-speak - ing folks would more gladly travel than in the
England of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		His epoch was probably the most enduringly memorable of all English history , for
England	LOCATION	was then freshest in sense of national consciousness and most vigorously beginning her course toward that empire which has so long outstretched the sunset .

		There have rarely been guides more trained to lead us in these paths of olden time than the writers of this book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	.

		Yet somehow they seem to take impish delight in leading us nowhere , unless it be to the heart of mists , blinding in kaleidoscopic and inconsequent detail .

		To have stated at full length , a little while ago , the thirty headings of the Table of Con - tents of the two volumes may perhaps have seemed wanton .

		Turn back to it , if you will , and see whether by any stretch of imagination you can decide why these separate topics should be arranged in this order rather than in any other .

		Unless you habitually resent the notion that there is a place for anything , and that those who handle things for us ought so far as they can to put them somewhere near where they belong , you can hardly avoid the sad impression that whoever put this book together permitted himself , at least in the matter of chapters , the luxurious assumption that nothing really belongs anywhere .

		What thus appears in the
Table of Contents	ORGANIZATION	seems to have pervaded the whole work of the editors , if not of the writers themselves .

		To all appearances , the editors of the volumes have been conscientious ; one may assume that they have carefully scrutinized every line of the texts submitted to them for publication , and that they have probably held strenuously to their privilege of pruning the style of their contributors , according to their own taste or needs .

		Otherwise the style of the whole vol - uminous work could hardly have achieved its hapless uniformity .

		For just as the chapters seem thrown together anyhow in the book , so do the paragraphs in the chapters , the sen - tences in the paragraphs , and very often the words in the sentences .

		The result is as if these skilful gamesters had shuffled to their utmost the numberless cards of their wit and wisdom , leaving the reader to do with them what he may , if he be blessed with the virtue of patience .

		So , once for all , this is a book not to read , but to consult .

		Its merits , like those of almost any cooperative work , are rather encyclopaedic than literary or historical .

		You may go to it confidently for information to think with , but you will find little help toward the processes of your thought .

		Its general want of system is therefore troublesome .

		An encyclopaedic work composed according to some logical plan may look confusing but prove methodical .

		An encyclopaedic work arranged alphabetically is certainly methodical , in a mechanical way , though like the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica '' it may need an index to complete its use - fulness .

		Sometimes , indeed , an encyclopaedic work alphabetically arranged may prove to have a readable and comprehensible unity of its own , as is the case with
Chamberlain	PERSON	's `` Things Japanese . ''

		But such an encyclopae - dic work as this `` Shakespeare 's
England	LOCATION	'' is like what the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica '' might be if the separate articles were arranged not in alphabetic order but just as they might happen to be handed in or to fit the conveniences of typesetting .

		Happily , as has been said , there are copious indexes .

		At the end of each chapter , too , you will find a short bibliography of the sub - ject there dealt with ; and the clearly printed pages are thus pleasantly freed from the dis - tracting , cumbrous , and ugly presence of all but essential footnotes .

		Whoever cares for his
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will be glad to have this treas - ury of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's surroundings among the books on his most accessible shelves .

		Unless , however , he be angelically free from human infirmities of temper he will often feel less than due gratitude to the editors and the writers who have placed their treasures at his disposal .

		For he can hardly avoid incessant and increasing wonder why men who have been willing to take such faithful pains as this book must have involved were not willing to take the not excessive extra pains needed to make their work systematic .

		What systems may ever emerge from this chaos must be con - structed by each reader for himself .

		Most , and perhaps all , will rest as content as may be with what help the indexes may afford them .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 455 AMERICAN POET AXD EDITOR .

		* In this cursory day the old familiar title , `` Life and Letters , '' has given way to `` Let - ters '' tout court ; the `` Life '' itself is assumed , implied , insinuated .

		Thus with
Miss Gilder	PERSON	's volume about her father ,
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, the late well-beloved editor of `` The Century . ''

		The documents themselves tell all that need be known regarding his career , his ideals , his friends , his activities .

		As `` documents , '' however , most of
Gilder	PERSON	's own letters might not carry far .

		Those who were in the habit of receiving them know too well what they commonly were hurried mazes of scolloped convolutions , brief impet - uosities from a generalissimo in the midst of an exacting campaign .

		But occasionally he found time to write at greater length ; then , too , his editor draws upon a journal , upon a sketch by himself of his childhood , and upon the letters that poured in on him from a wide , varied , and interesting circle of friends .

		It is quite apparent that
Gilder	PERSON	himself , and his family with him , favored the view that he was primarily a poet .

		The publica - tion of his first volume of verse , the love - sonnets of `` The New Day , '' in
1873	DATE	, was an immense event for the family about to be ; scarcely less so , the entry of his complete poems , in
1908	DATE	, into the `` Household Edition '' of the poets .

		In
1890	DATE	he says : `` I am writing verse all the time and have a whole drawerful of unpublished poetry , if poetry it may be . ''

		In
1905	DATE	he enumerates for a friend his various college degrees and other dignities attained ; yet he adds : '' If you will state on positive evidence that I am a poet , I would rather that than all the rest put together . ''

		But it was not as a poet that , during a sharp campaign against Tammany , he addressed casual curbstoners from the tail - end of a truck .

		It was rather as the moralist and publicist , one in whom an intense indigna - tion and a high eagerness for civic righteous - ness had clouded for the moment his choice of means .

		Other public services were per - formed with a clearer realization of the fact that , for minds and natures of a certain type , influence by secondary impact offers the most hopeful course .

		On some such basis
Gilder	PERSON	promoted civil service reform , served effi - ciently on a tenement-house commission , sup - ported his friend
Cleveland	LOCATION	for the presidency , and championed
Hughes	PERSON	for governor against
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	in the stirring cam - paign of

		`` yellow '' chivalry .

		But long before this he had acknowledged a sensitiveness to the `` ridicule attaching to a literary man 's inter - est in public affairs in this country '' fear - ing , consequently , to injure any cause in the service of which he might be drafted .

		A singular phase of life , and one unique in civilized lands .

		Yet the American public will probably per - sist in regarding
Gilder	PERSON	almost wholly as an editor .

		As such , he was actuated from the start by lofty principles and by a full deter - mination to lead his following toward the best .

		He showed his quality and his char - acter when but a subordinate of Dr.
Holland	PERSON	's on the old `` Scribner 's , '' by objecting to one reputable and approved habit of that day : the printing among regular contribu - tions of articles which were practically adver - tisements and paid for as such .

		His chief stoutly maintained that every one of these articles was based squarely on merits that justified praise ; yet
Gilder	PERSON	carried his point , and magazine morality advanced a peg .

		Later on , as the controlling hand of a great organ , he spread his exacting but generous principles over the whole magazine field .

		`` He never dealt , '' his daughter well says , `` with one 's literary products merely as wares for the market '' ; his concern was with `` their source , the author , and with his pages as things still hopefully in the making . ''

		Hav - ing reached good results over the right road , he could not but take a fine and sensitive pride in his own activities , could not but indulge a ceaseless care for the standards of the magazine , `` the Soul of which is , in a way , my Soul , which I do n't want to see damned in this world or the next . ''

		In time he had to face the problem of `` changing conditions . ''

		He saw , as early as
1896	DATE	, the coming of a different day : `` the vulgarizing of everything in life and letters and politics and religion ... sickens the soul . ''

		Yet he stood ready , as ever , to fight for `` the permanent forces of good '' and `` the current triumphs of decency , '' refusing to be counted as `` an old horse , too cranky to learn new tricks . ''

		The War Series and the `` Life of Lincoln '' were now far in the past .

		Far behind , too , the day when he had written : `` I would rather have one article by
Grant	ORGANIZATION	on a battle won by him ... than twenty articles by Daudet on Mistral , '' however much he might like
Provence	LOCATION	.

		Better far the heroic events told by the hero of them ; nor must `` literature and art make dilettanti of us ! ''

		Here we have , unmistakably , the essential lineaments of the editor and the man ; as an 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	editor , one of the last and best of the type .

		An editor indeed : no quavering clerk or secretary , on the one hand ; no hard , brusque accomplice of the counting-room , on the other ; but a vigorous , self-confident , self-directing personality with full command of impressive means , firmly resolved to use his instrument for the best good of his day and people , and daring to please himself as a prime means of pleasing others ; least of all a tempter and a tyrant intent upon perverting and outrag - ing youthful talents for the sake of immediate gains .

		He encouraged new writers to give forth their best , not their worst ; he was glad to see them further strengthened by the right exercise of their strength , and held no slight - est thought of `` realizing '' on them as quickly as might be , while heedless of their future good name as artists and as men .

		The volume reconstructs for us the circle which the Gilders drew around themselves during the
last years of the last century	DATE	.

		This is a period not quite far enough away to take on any glamour of the historic , and not quite near enough to link up with the skittish and equivocal activities of the present .

		It deals with the days when
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	wintered commandingly at
Washington	LOCATION	and summered as a neighbor of the Gilders at
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's
Bay	LOCATION	; the days when
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	was still a figure , when Saint -
Gaudens	PERSON	was climbing the upward slope , when
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	and
Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	were dawning on
America	LOCATION	; the days of the picturesque stable in East Fifteenth Street and of the statelier home in
Clinton Place	LOCATION	.

		These days of public domesticity , or of private prominence , are touched upon with a fond discretion by the daughter of the house , and they epitomize in pleasant fashion the time and town wherein a sincere and enthusiastic man was able , by virtue of his combined character and metier , to employ a diversity of fine elements for per - sonal delectation and public advantage .

		attained .

		He wrote his history with a superb sense of the picturesque .

		He had a veritable genius for narration .

		Only
Carlyle	PERSON	has equalled , and perhaps only
Michelet	PERSON	has sur - passed , his amazing instinct for historical portraiture .

		He wrote with a pen of flame ; and he made the time of which he wrote point a striking lesson to the time in which he lived .

		His book was itself a conflict ; and the `` Politics '' is no more than the moral pendant to the earlier tale .

		It is a valuable addition to political liter - ature that is made in this excellent transla - tion .

		It will serve a doubly useful purpose .

		It will dissipate that pretty piece of mytho - poiesis which made some men fear that
Treitschke	PERSON	was in truth a great political thinker .

		It serves also to make us understand something of the appeal his book has made to his fellow-countrymen .

		Political Science has rarely undergone so elaborate and vicious a simplification as here .

		The thesis of the book is clear enough .

		It announces with an easy flourish that the Germans are the chosen people ; and it urges them to beget power unto themselves that they may thereby the better justify the ways of God to man .

		Thus baldly stated , it is perhaps not difficult to realize why such an attitude should , on the whole , have failed to secure any widespread popularity .

		It is an attitude which calls for what
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	once happily termed `` universal ejaculation . ''

		But the book was taken seriously in its original form .

		It became the catechism of the youthful soldiers who felt that the winning of one 's spurs can best be accomplished on the battlefield .

		Treitschke wrote vigorously and eloquently .

		He believed wholeheartedly the doctrine that he preached .

		His own fanatic sincerity seemed of itself to carry conviction to his hearers .

		As a book it was eminently readable , even though it was full of curious inaccuracies and passionate misunderstandings .

		For Treitschke , whatever he was , was not a scholar .

		He had no idea of handling evidence .

		He was not in the least careful of truth .

		He had a gospel to proclaim , and his books were to him as missionaries which set forth the cherished word .

		History to him was the vehicle of political opinion , and it was to convince his country - men that the `` Politics '' was written .

		It was perhaps the logical result of the atmosphere of his time .

		First in war , preeminent in scholarship , the leader of the world in the musical arts , with a growing commerce and an expanding population , it was not difficult
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 to be convinced that
Germany	LOCATION	had a great mission to achieve .

		And it was significant that she had attained that position by a strik - ing unification .

		She had consolidated her power by the expulsion of alien elements from the body politic .

		She had been dosed with blood and iron that she might accom - plish that destinyr She had vanquished
Austria	LOCATION	.


France	LOCATION	lay almost stricken at her feet .

		If vague fears might be cherished of
Russia	LOCATION	, the colossus seemed hardly yet to bestir herself in her sleep .

		The Papacy , indeed , was dangerous ; and Treitschke heartily sympathized with
Bismarck	PERSON	when he set out on that journey which took a Ger - man prince a second time to
Canossa	LOCATION	.

		Unity was strength ; and the secret of unity was absorptiveness .

		If that was to be attained
Germany	LOCATION	must dominate
Europe	LOCATION	, and remove from the field all chance of rivalry .

		It was
England	LOCATION	alone she had to fear .

		England was the mistress of hypocrisy , a nation sunk in the degradation of a pitiful materialism .

		A civilization she did not possess .

		Her leadership of the nations was negatived by her intellectual sterility .

		She must He deprived of her commanding position .

		It is
Germany	LOCATION	alone which is fitted , alike by char - acter and by genius , to assume the task
England	LOCATION	has so unworthily fulfilled .

		As
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Prince '' wrote a text-book of Italian freedom , so does
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's `` Politics '' constitute the alpha - bet of German conquest .

		It is a vivid por - trayal of method .

		The object of politics is power , and all things are right if they but serve that end .

		For power only is good where men seek after no other possession .

		The one object of the
State	ORGANIZATION	must be expansion .

		To be small is to be contemptible , and to be contemptible is to be comic .

		The good Treitschke can barely restrain his laughter as he thinks of small nations like
Belgium	LOCATION	and parsimonious tongues like the Dutch .

		Growth is the test of worth , and if our neighbor 's elbow seems inconvenient , forthwith let us draw our sword .

		There is to him a virtue in war which makes it partake of the divine .

		It steels the heart of a nation , breeds in it endur - ance , obedience , courage ; and it hastens the best of action .

		The criterion of good thus becomes survival , and competition the law of life .

		`` We have a continuous struggle of nations in which the battle is ever to the strongest .

		So that , in such analysis , treaties are but inconveniences the statesman will toss lightly from his path .

		Obligation is a snare , and honor the apple by which the weaker Eve would tempt the strong Adam of the German nation .

		For such wanton childishness no practical statesman will have patience .

		His business is to succeed , and he will absorb his methods in his end .

		A fine Hegelianism , which makes morality the servant of his pur - pose , a sword to destroy rather than to judge !

		These to him are the great truths of politics , and these
Germany	LOCATION	alone seems able to per - ceive .

		So that her destiny it is to enweave them into the fabric of her civilization that they may be the instruments of her national life .

		i She will utilize them that she may prosper ; for with her prosperity will come the posses - sion of power .

		Thus will she attain the good in life .

		She will cease to be swayed by petty and individual considerations .

		The parts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	will be swept in one vast glance into its vortex , and the fulness of its life will be the measure of their happiness .

		They will be its slaves that they may have the joyous recognition of its mastery over other slaves .

		It has an ugly flavor about it , and there are not wanting signs that on occasion Treitschke himself shrank not a little from its raucous cynicism .

		True , it may be that on Rhine and
Vistula Germany	LOCATION	must keep her legions that she may maintain in safety the integrity of her national life .

		But a political theory must be tested by its fruits , and there will be few found to deny that the history of this is written in letters of fire and blood .

		It goes back to the beast in man .

		It has in it the spirit of a cunning and ruthless paganism .

		It makes entire abstraction of the facts that have made for progress in modern times .

		It chooses to forget that if this is a world in which we have to die , it is a world in which we have also to live .

		Homo homini lupus ; but we look forward rather than to the past .

		The teaching of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	has found its natural function , and we do not honor him for its accomplishment .

		It is well that we should have the means of its acquaintance .

		It is the first step in the evolution of a moral policy to have rejected it .

		Brilliantly and with a fine show of practicability it may have been expounded .

		It may vaunt itself proudly as a creed for men .

		But a philosophy which sets out by rejecting humanity can hardly com - mand acceptance from human beings .

		Rather shall we regret that so brilliant an intelligence should have been devoted to the construction of so vicious an aspiration .

		458 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30 IRELAND , 1916	DATE	* The Irish people have suffered more than almost any other from the misrepresentations of the popular proverb , and the multifarious and amazing development of their literature during the last twenty years has bewildered Americans by its revelations of a reality all the stranger because the Irish have been so much a part of our own social family .

		One of the conventions about Irishmen has been that if by chance they found themselves in agreement they would immediately make their agreement itself a cause for new differ - ences .

		Whoever imagines that in holding this belief he is anywhere near the truth ought to stop reading the newspapers and glance at one or two of the books listed below , chosen almost at random from the dozen or so that suggest that
Ireland	LOCATION	this
autumn	DATE	has become a sort of obsession with American publishers .

		Widely different in theme , treatment , and authorship , all these books testify to a new congruity in Irish life , the result of an all but fully developed national consciousness .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	writes : In every nation , there is a smother of activities that seem aimless and confused to the careless beholder , but somewhere in the midst of them , clear - eyed , cool-brained workers are guiding the chaos toward coherence .

		In little country towns and remote villages in
Ireland	LOCATION	there are young men inspired by Sir
Horace Plunkett	PERSON	and IE who are formulating a synthesis of Irish life .

		They are few in number now and , for many reasons , not fully articulate , but they will grow in strength and power .

		They have done with old angers and ancient rages and the bit - ter wrangling of semi-dotards , nor have they any interest in internecine quarrels , the differences between Catholic and Protestant , Orangeman and ancient Hibernian .

		They are bored by ` the sor - rows of
Ireland	LOCATION	' ; they do not desire ever again to hear of the horrors of the Great Famine or of any famine , for they are resolved that , so far as is humanly possible ,
Ireland	LOCATION	shall know no more famine .

		They are tired to death of rhetoricians such as Mr.
John Eedmond	PERSON	; they are sick of oratory and Irish - Americans and Curse-the-Pope-put-your-fut-in-his - belly Orangemen ; and above all they are tired of
Ireland	LOCATION	in the part of Lazarus whining for crumbs from
England	LOCATION	's table ... A mollycoddled
Ireland	LOCATION	, to them , is an abomination ; but an
Ireland	LOCATION	which has risen in agony and bloody sweat to the realization of a great destiny is to them a beautiful land , com - manding and receiving all their services .

		and bearing the title `` Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	and the Ulster Movement , '' and it is char - acteristic that
Carson	PERSON	himself occupies less than a dozen pages of the book , just enough to prove him , in Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	's phrase , `` the last comic Irishman . ''

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	, in fact , quite frankly says that men like
Carson	PERSON	and
Redmond	PERSON	are of little importance in
Ireland	LOCATION	and that they and their like must perish if
Ireland	LOCATION	is to be saved .

		His particular thesis is that the Ulster Unionist movement was engineered by old men in the face of the indifference or actual hostility of the young men , Protestant or Catholic , and that the only chance for its colossal bluff to succeed lay in commandeering a ``
Dublin	LOCATION	playboy '' to direct it .

		One can well believe that the significance of
Carson	PERSON	's career is fairly indicated in this treatment , which enables the author by dramatic contrast to describe all the more effectively the real progress in Irish affairs and the real identity in aims and in practical tendency between Ulster and the South .

		The pretense of a biography is only a skilful device enabling him to produce one of the clearest and most cordial statements that have yet been written of the devoted purpose of
Young Ireland	LOCATION	as a whole .

		This calm , assured faith that
Ireland	LOCATION	's future is shaping itself behind the bewilder - ments of the present shines through every page of Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	's sensitive , impressionistic account of `` The Insurrection in
Dublin	LOCATION	. ''

		Were it not for this faith one would lay down the book with a tragic sense only of having witnessed ignorant armies clash by night ; for , as one sober-minded workingman said to Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	, `` they had no chance , and they never said they had , and they never thought they would have any . ''

		What strikes one most in the author 's atti - tude is the same quality that strikes one most in the attitude of the insurrectionists them - selves , a calm , composed , impersonal spirit of good will , of wondering detachment , that has made the whole tragic episode seem so much for something , something greater than any individual life , that one almost forgets it was against anything at all .

		.

		`` Nothing is lost .

		Not even brave men , '' Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	says .

		`` They have been used . ''

		And every - thing that has been written about the leaders of the rising bears him out .

		When
James Connolly	PERSON	was asked if he would say a prayer for the men who were shooting him , he replied , `` I will ; and I will say a prayer for every good man in the world who is doing his duty . ''

		Nothing could more completely show that
Ireland	LOCATION	has achieved her nationality than the dozens of recorded speeches like this .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 459 Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	offers his own explanation of i the rising and how it came about ; he lays the responsibility upon Mr.
Redmond	PERSON	for having pledged
Ireland	LOCATION	to a particular course of action , at the opening of the war , without possessing any authority to give the pledge or ; any guarantee that it would be met .

		It is , in fact , the healthiest sign of
Ireland	LOCATION	's new nationhood that the younger generation in !

		this way is far readier to see
Ireland	LOCATION	itself and
Ireland	LOCATION	's own statesmen at fault than to \ dwell on
England	LOCATION	's errors .

		But the most interesting part of the book is the day-by-day story of what one man saw and heard walking about the streets , drinking in rumor and ; bewilderment , listening to the comments of !

		this and that man in the street , and reflecting quite passively on the lens of his own spirit not so much the facts of the insurrection itself as its reaction in the popular mind .

		The j facts themselves , meanwhile , are effectively !

		chronicled in the bulky book edited by
Maurice Joy	PERSON	and largely written by
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, in conjunction with six other writers , `` The Irish Rebellion of
1916	DATE	and Its Martyrs . ''

		Though the first part of this book is full of admirably arranged information .

		I about the causes and history of the rebellion , it is to the second part on `` personalities and ideals '' that most readers will turn ; and few indeed will read these fine sketches of
MacDonagh	ORGANIZATION	and the
Pearses	LOCATION	,
Connolly	ORGANIZATION	,
Plunkett	PERSON	, Sheehy-Skeffington , the Countess j Markicwicz , and Sir
Roger Casement	PERSON	without envying
Ireland	LOCATION	its future sealed with so many Wild and perilous holy things Flaming with a martyr 's blood .

		Never before probably has it occurred that I virtually all the leaders of a revolutionary movement were poets ; and the fact , in a way , j both confirms and sanctifies the extraordinary i part played by literature in the development : of
Ireland	LOCATION	's national consciousness .

		The names of most of the leaders are chronicled in
Ernest A. Boyd	PERSON	's ``
Ireland	LOCATION	's Literary Renaissance , '' an excellently full , well-bal - anced analysis and summary of
Ireland	LOCATION	's con - tribution to the world 's culture during the last thirty years .

		Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	has not attempted to give any philosophy of Irish literature , nor has he been at pains to relate the literary to the various other manifestations of
Ireland	LOCATION	's renaissance .

		He deals with literature rather as a phenomenon than as an expression , and in accordance with this scheme of treatment he has introduced hardly a line of biography in all the four hundred closely packed pages of his book .

		This method has its obvious advantages : its very impersonality and detachment themselves reflect the peculiar dignity of his theme .

		One feels that he was right in choosing it , for the agricultural and educational movements that are making Ire - land into a new country have sprung so largely from poets ' brains that her social life seems almost more an expression of her literature than vice versa .

		The first inspiration of the movement , according to Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	, came from
Standish O'Grady	PERSON	's Homeric re-creation of
Ireland	LOCATION	's mythology ; but it is notable that he attrib - utes the creation of a literary life in
Ireland	LOCATION	`` at a time when some fusion of intellectual activities was most essential to the future of the Revival '' to the group of
Dublin	LOCATION	mystics whose example made it possible to end the tradition which imposed upon every Irish author the necessity of going to
London	LOCATION	or at least of offering his work to English editors and publishers .

		That mysticism or , in a more technical sense , theosophy , should have been the original bond of union between
Yeats	PERSON	, `` JE '' -LRB-
George Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , and
John Eglinton	PERSON	, and should have formed the nucleus of the whole movement , shows how little Irish society evoked the literature which , made up `` out of whole cloth , '' as it were , was destined , on the contrary , to create its own social back - ground .

		Russell 's mysticism , of course , expressed itself immediately in a practical form by seconding the efforts of Sir
Horace Plunkett	PERSON	in the cooperative agricultural move - ment , and out of this revivified life of the peasantry has sprung one of the most notable departments of the Irish drama .

		But the whole tendency of this new litera - ture , especially exemplified in the work of
Yeats	PERSON	, and resulting from the constantly increasing development of a rich and firmly built social life , has been to descend with most happy results from the dream-world of mys - ticism and of `` the passions and beliefs of ancient times '' to the concrete world of every - day .

		Ireland is now producing a realistic literature shot through with a poetry and a fantasy all its own , and of immense value both to the spiritual and the social life of the people .

		It is this evolution that Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	chronicles , frankly basing his values on the exigencies of `` national culture '' and leaving to some historian to come the task of divining its relationships in a larger world .

		It is noticeable that Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's book con - tains no section devoted to criticism and that it does not even indicate the reasons why the renaissance has been so barren in this vital field .

		The fact is , as
Thomas MacDonagh	PERSON	sug - gests in the wonderfullv interesting testament 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	he has left behind him , `` Literature in Ire - land , '' that the new movement has already suffered too much from criticism of the wrong kind and that its materials have not yet reached a sufficient degree of coherence for the right kind of criticism to emerge .

		`` There is a school of criticism in
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' he says , referring by implication to the late Professor
Dowden	PERSON	and the pundits of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, `` a school that knows the work of the finest critics in the world , and knows , too , what is more important , the finest literature in the world ... Dealing with the monuments of the older literatures , English , French , and the like , this criticism knows its place , its bearings , its conditions .

		Dealing with a nais - sant literature or with two naissant litera - tures , with literature still at the lyric stage , it looks over its shoulder , as it were .

		Its neck is awry .

		Its eyes are twisted round .

		Its feet turn from their known way and stumble . ''

		And he points out how , precisely as in Amer - ica , this criticism retards the growth of a proper understanding between the native writer and his audience .

		What
MacDonagh	PERSON	has himself attempted to do is to delimit the individuality of Irish ways of thinking and feeling and of the rhythm of Irish speech , and to build up a consciousness of the peculiarly Irish mode .

		His main thesis is somewhat beclouded by the fact that the Revival itself hesitates between the two paths , a return to Gaelic and a continuation of the anomalous Anglo-Irish mode in which its greatest works have been wrought .

		Therefore what the reader will chiefly enjoy in this fine , tentative unfolding of a point of view is the suggestions thrown out by the way .

		Among these are the contention that
Ireland	LOCATION	has lain outside the tradition of
Hellenized Europe	LOCATION	, the discussion of the peculiar fresh - ness of the Irishman 's handling of the English tongue , and the learned analysis of Irish prosody and of the relation between the Anglicized literary production of the past and the authentically native production of the present .

		MacDonagh 's own sympathies lie mainly with the language-revivalists who have made Gaelic so potent an instrument in awakening the national consciousness , and perhaps the greatest weakness of his argu - ment is that he takes no note of the likeli - hood that the language will be unable to keep pace with the inevitable expansion of Ire - land 's social life and the modern complica - tions the achievement of
Home Eule	ORGANIZATION	will immediately bring upon it .

		But certainly contemporary criticism has produced few books more profoundly suggestive than this .

		THE STRANGE CASE OF
MR. CHESTERTON	PERSON	.

		* The wistfulness with which the radicals of our time survey the imposing bulk and pro- digious energy of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is not without its pathos .

		They regard him , clearly , as a spiritual brother who has just missed sharing their heritage of revolt by reason of a slight temperamental perversity .

		Nor is this at all strange .

		He is as pugnacious as any of them ; he has more than once professed a tenderness for revolutions in general ; and he is an unmistakable democrat .

		When he begins to tell us what is wrong with the world , his generous indignation has a way of getting the better of his jollity ; and we hear him denouncing meanness , greed , oppression , every kind of brutishness and inhumanity , with the terrific earnestness of a man whose whole nature has been outraged .

		In short , he is spiritually on the side of the angels , and it is not surprising that his liberal critics show a general reluctance to giving Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	up as hopeless .

		Mr.
Julius West	PERSON	does not , one feels , give him up .

		There is more than a hint of wist - fulness in the eye he turns on his subject .

		There is a twinkle of amusement also ; for the jollity and humanity that are always recom - mending Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	to the affections , can be stretched to invest his creed , too , with a very special kind of sanction .

		Finding him - self pretty generally in disagreement with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's views , Mr.
West	PERSON	remains , it seems to me , admirably fair .

		If he is unable to give his subject a very good mark as nov - elist and teller of tales , at least he admires him whole-heartedly as humorist and poet , and accords him even more than justice , I think , as critic .

		It is sophistication and not malice that prompts him to remark that most people would consider it pure pedantry to insist that a Chestertonian romance need differ appreciably from a Chestertonian essay , poem , or criticism ; and that a book by Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	should describe itself as a novel means little more than that its original purchasing price was four shillings and
six pence	MONEY	.

		As for Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's humor , Mr.
West	PERSON	thinks it will live long , even in a cloyed world .

		It is of the freshest , so spontaneous indeed that his pro- ductions seem to
spring	DATE	`` from his vitality rather than his intellect . ''

		As poet he is a master of bold imagery ; he has more impulse , perhaps , than finish ; but his natural gift of rhythm and his knack of finding effective words more or less compensate for his refusal *

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 461 or his incapacity to take pains .

		As critic , says Mr.
West	PERSON	with perfect justice , he can be acute and penetrating as long as he has a sub - ject that he can relate with his own views of the universe .

		But Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has not sufficiently confined himself to such subjects , and there are many of us who remember his ineptitudes and his intolerance rather than his flashes of insight and sympathy .

		I have said that Mr.
West	PERSON	strikes me as everywhere fair .

		I submit that it is sufficient proof of a critic 's fairness if he takes the pains to consider Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	in separate chapters as romancer , as critic , as poet and humorist , as religious debater , and as politi - cian .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has borrowed these various masks in his time and rushed excitedly about shouting gorgeous epigrams and Gothic grotesqueries through the painted lips ; but the point to notice is that they have been the same epigrams and the same grotesqueries .

		Indeed , I think that , if you read the several chapters of Mr.
West	PERSON	's clever book carefully , you will agree that what he has sketched everywhere with bold and free strokes is the portrait of that essentially modern figure , the controversial journalist .

		Even as romancer Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's unit of work is , as his critic points out , the page rather than the volume ; and I think he might fairly have added that the page , or at most the chapter , is commonly also the reader 's unit of response .

		Journalism , like the art of prestidigitation , requires a sovereign economy of means .

		As journalist Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has been busy all his life compressing big subjects into little columns .

		Naturally , the accommodation has not always been perfect , and he has often had to distract attention from the failure of the trick by an imaginative tour de force or an outburst of Falstaffian humor .

		He is an adept in eking out argument with epigram , or substituting one for the other whenever it suits his purpose .

		Take him to task , accuse him of having shuffled or evaded the issue , and he may quite plausibly argue that a journalist in seeking everywhere to be scrupu - lously fair will often be unjust to his own cause the space needed for explication is usually wanting .

		Or he may excuse his lack of pedantic thoroughness in a little paper on less solemn grounds and make out a strictly literary case for proportion .

		In any event , given the assured dexterity of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, the journalist will be tempted to save his argu - ment by legerdemain , if he can save it in no other way .

		Doubtless Mr.
West	PERSON	has no hope of inducing Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	as a debater to indulge in a sober dialectic ; he has seen too many other controversies end in amiable personalities .

		Nevertheless , he patiently puts the questions propounded by many another critic and lib - eral before him , the chief of which is this : What , then , are you really for ?

		It has been impossible for these critics to believe that a man could live by antagonisms alone , espe - cially a man so solid and well nourished .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has been against socialism , against something that he imagines to be science , against specific social reforms of whatever sort , against votes for women , against atheism and agnosticism and all the other current isms that he lumps somewhat loosely together under the one term , heterodoxy .

		In fact , complains Mr.
West	PERSON	, he has been so everlast - ingly and so explosively against all these things that he has not found time to be for anything in particular , unless it be for the democratic right to drink beer in public houses and cultivate a grandiose mysticism .

		This negative attitude strikes his liberal friends , I suppose , as the crowning paradox in the paradoxical creed of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		They remember that no one has assailed the greed of capitalists , the cruelty of exploiters , and the excesses of Jingoes more terrifically .

		No one has more valiantly supported the cause of labor , or shown himself in general more humane .

		Why will he have none of their remedies ?

		How can he content himself with purely destructive criticism ?

		Well , democ - racvjias clearly never been for Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	a convenient instrument for achieving certain highly desirable social ends .

		He is that most stubborn of mystics , a determined and thor - oughly conscious mystic ; and democracy is one of his religions a religion so sacred and so sufficient for the needs of men that he likes to dream of it as automatically operating to prepare a better future .

		If his peculiar mys - ticism is not rightly English , at least his fierce individualism is deeply rooted in English soil .

		What could be more natural to an English - man whose home is his castle than that night - marish terror of official oppression which Mr.

		* It is easy to poke fun at the
Irish National Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, and perhaps it is equally easy to over - estimate its achievements .

		Yet those achieve - ments are real and important ; and when we consider that they have been accomplished within half a generation , they seem indeed worthy of unstinted praise .

		It may be worth while to enumerate them briefly .

		For the first time in history , the life of the peas - ants , its comedy and tragedy , has received adequate dramatic expression .

		No other na - tion , so far as I am aware , has a peasant drama to be compared with the Irish in richness , intimacy , and completeness .

		Sec - ond , the dramatists of the Abbey Theatre have been pioneers in developing the previously unrealized possibilities of the one-act play .

		They may be said , indeed , to have created a new technique of the one-act play , a tech - nique that already , in this country alone , counts its imitators and practitioners by the dozen .

		The key to these new possibili - ties of the one-act piece is the discovery that it need not rely exclusively upon situation for its interest .

		Third , the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	has built up an excellent stock company with acting traditions of its own ; as to this , many of us can testify who were fortunate enough to see the Irish players when they visited this country in
1914	DATE	.

		Fourth , it has created a taste and a public for the new kinds of work which its authors have done .

		Fifth , it has produced , along with a number of poor plays , a relatively large body of meritorious ones .

		And last , and most impor - tant for the world at large , it has given opportunity for the development of two dramatists of genius ,
J. M. Synge	PERSON	and St.
John Ervine	PERSON	.

		For sixteen years -LRB- counting from the founding of the Irish National Theatre in
1900	DATE	-RRB- , that is a remarkable record .

		The writers of the three volumes now under consideration all belong to the younger group of playwrights .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's book con - tains five lively little farce-comedies , of the type which Lady Gregory made popular .

		They show no remarkable originality , but are full of high spirits and a gay and careless humor .

		If I may judge from `` Duty , '' which I saw in
1914	DATE	, the plays would act better than they read .

		Reading the book continuously , one gets rather tired of the fre - quently recurring types of character , which * DUTY , and Other Irish Comedies .

		present very little variety .

		Almost any group of characters might be transferred from one play to another ; in a given situa - tion , most of them would act in the same way .

		An outline of the story of `` Retribu - tion , '' the last of the plays , will indicate the character of them all .

		At the rise of the curtain
Patcha Cremin	PERSON	is discovered asleep in bed .

		His landlady wakes him up and informs him , in spite of his assertion that he is sick , that she will turn him out of the house the next day unless he pays his rent .

		After her departure there comes in a visitor ,
Dannux Touhy	PERSON	, an old crony of
Patcha	ORGANIZATION	's , who is also dead broke .

		From their conversation it appears that
Patcha	PERSON	has shared his bed the night before with another friend ,
Nedsers Brophy	PERSON	, who has now gone out to get some money for breakfast by pawning
Patcha	ORGANIZATION	's one suit of clothes .

		Nedsers returns partly drunk , and explains that he has lost the money .

		Dannux has been trying to borrow some money of
Patcha	LOCATION	to buy tools for a job he says he has undertaken for the parish priest ; he now proposes that he should take
Nedsers	ORGANIZATION	's clothes out and pawn them to buy the tools , promising to return and share with the others the money which the priest will pay him .

		After he has gone with the clothes , his two pals remember that the priest is away in
England	LOCATION	on his vacation , and give up hope of seeing Dannux or the suit again .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's three plays are longer and more ambitious .

		They all deal with the con - flict between the individual and the family group , at different social levels .

		In `` The Land '' the harsh assertion of paternal au - thority in an affair of marriage drives the young peasant hero to emigrate to
America	LOCATION	.

		Ten of
Murtagh Cosgar	ORGANIZATION	's children have left him , and only two remain ,
Matt	PERSON	, and
Sally	PERSON	, a rather stupid girl .

		Matt is in love with
Ellen Douras	PERSON	, a clever and ambitious girl without a portion .

		Her reluctance to settle down in the old place , combined with Mur - tagh 's opposition to the match , results in the emigration of the pair ; while the stupid Sally , matched with
Ellen	PERSON	's equally dull brother
Cornelius	PERSON	, remains to inherit the land .

		In `` The Fiddler 's House '' .

		the old wandering musician wishes his daughters to take the road again with him , while they try to induce him to remain and work the little farm .

		In `` Thomas Muskerry '' it is the old father , master of the workhouse , whose intention to live his last years in peace is defeated by his resolute daughter and her family .

		It is note - worthy that as Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's characters go higher in the social scale , they become less attractive .

		The peasants in `` The Land '' are
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 463 all likable ; the official 's family in `` Thomas Muskerry '' is mercenary and detestable .

		The best of the three plays is `` The Land '' ; but none of them shows marked power of char - acterization or technical skill .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	, as I have already suggested , is a writer of very different calibre .

		The `` Four Irish Plays '' now collected are all ear - lier than ''
Jane Clegg	PERSON	'' and ``
John Ferguson	PERSON	, '' which preceded them in American publica - tion , and were reviewed in THE DIAL some months ago .

		The book includes one four-act play , `` Mixed Marriage , '' two one-act pieces , `` The Magnanimous Lover '' and `` The Orangeman , '' and one bit of local satire , `` The Critics . ''

		The last is unimportant .

		`` The Orangeman '' and `` The Magnanimous Lover '' rise distinctly above the average level of Irish plays through their grasp of charac - ter .

		But they are both slight compared with `` Mixed Marriage , '' which is a worthy fore - runner of the two great realistic plays Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	has since written .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	's spe - cial field is the north of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In `` Mixed Marriage '' he has skilfully combined two themes , the struggle between the older and the younger generations , and the folly o , f the workingmen in allowing religious differ - ences to be played on in industrial disputes .


John Rainey	PERSON	is an intelligent but obstinate and bigoted old Protestant laborer who wields great influence among the
Orangemen	LOCATION	.

		The capitalistic interests endeavor to break up a strike by stirring religious prejudices : and at first Rainey , ably assisted by
Michael O'Hara	PERSON	, a broad-minded and tolerant young Catholic , successfully blocks this move by his determined opposition .

		When , however , he learns that his son Hugh intends to marry
Nora Murray	PERSON	, a Catholic girl , all the ancient religious prejudice with which his nature is imbued reasserts itself and gets the better of his intelligent judgment .

		After trying by every means in his power to break off the match and failing , he throws his influence on the side of the hired agitators .

		The strike ends in a riot , involving the tragic death of
Nora	PERSON	, who believes that her unwillingness to give up her lover has led to all the trouble .

		Like ``
Jane Clegg	PERSON	'' and ``
John Ferguson	PERSON	, '' the play is remarkable for the intense vitality and individuality of the characters , and for the admirable economy of means by which the author obtains his effects .

		There are only six speaking characters , and the scene remains the same throughout .

		What distinguishes Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	from most of the other Irish dram - atists is his mastery of his craft and his firm grasp of character .

		About most of the Irish plays , Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's , for instance , there is a sort of amateurishness .

		Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	has none of their aimless talkativeness , their vagueness , their tendency to rest content with second-rate workmanship .

		With him every stroke is clear and firm , and every stroke tells .

		You will go far in recent drama before you find a better drawn character than Mrs.
Rainey	PERSON	, or her husband , or
Mike O'Hara	PERSON	.

		These people are alive , and we feel that our experience is enriched through knowing them .

		No one who wishes to keep in touch with the best that is being done in the modern theatre can afford to neglect Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	.

		SIXTY YEARS OF THE AMERICAN STAGE .

		* So long as the supply of well-equipped actors , trained after the ancient method , lasted , it was possible to find leading performers who without any very gross flattery might be described as stars when compared with their associates .

		But this source was exhausted long ago .

		At any rate they were actors of the first class , if not always at the head of it .

		None of them had a successor .

		There is not on the American stage to-day one solitary performer , male or female , of native origin , who is capable of first-class work in either the tragic or comic depart - ment of the literary imaginative drama .

		In modern drama we have some excellent performers , but even in this no great one .

		Why is this !

		It is because the wells of histrionic talent have been choked .

		As I have said before , there are indications that they may before long be reopened .

		Already there is a group of rising young English actors of both sexes likely to do big things in big drama in the near future .

		Where do they come from ?

		Almost without exception from the stage company of
F. E. Benson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	represents the Irving tradition .

		The above paragraph expresses the judgment to which sixty years of theatre-going and for - ty-three years of service as dramatic critic have led Mr.
John Ranken Towse	PERSON	, who now assembles in a book a series of reminiscences of the stage originally given to the public through the columns of `` The
New York	LOCATION	Even - ing Post . ''

		He has had one definite conclu - sion forced upon him : During the last fifty years the art of acting upon the English-speaking stage has steadily declined : ... this result is due chiefly to the establishment of the commercial star and circuit system by speculative managers , possessed of considerable executive abil - ity , but , as a rule , devoid of artistic knowledge , instincts , or ambition ; partly to the creation of railroads , which have made the circuit system feasible , and partly to the enormous improvements in mechan - ical and lighting devices , which have increased the possibilities of spectacle and thus enabled managers to attract the remunerative crowd , with whom an appeal to the eye is so much more potent than an appeal to the understanding or good taste .

		464 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	Mr.
Towse	PERSON	's book is a rapid sketch of the literary drama on the English-speaking stage .

		It begins with the
Haymarket	LOCATION	and
Sadler	PERSON	's Wells in
England	LOCATION	, with
Charles Kean	PERSON	,
John Gilbert	PERSON	,
Samuel Phelps	PERSON	, and other great names ; but the bulk of the work is devoted to the
New York	LOCATION	stage from
1870	DATE	-LRB- the year after the author 's emigration to
America	LOCATION	-RRB- to the end of the century .

		While not formally including the twentieth century theatre or European stars merely making visits to the
United States	LOCATION	, he devotes space to some few performers like
Sothern	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	whose careers have continued into the twentieth cen - tury , and to foreigners like
Salvini	PERSON	whose support on the American stage has been Eng - lish-speaking .

		Mr.
Towse	PERSON	's treatment is necessarily brief ; but the unhesitating and emphatic nature of his opinions , and the vividness of the impres - sions he has caught from great performances , and the feeling for great literary drama that lies at the basis of his judgments , are such as to make his pages themselves a sort of stage on which the great figures of the past pass in review in their many parts .

		If at times his book seems gossipy , its gossip is not of the trivial sort , but elevated and elevating .

		We get such glimpses as that of Macready :
Macready	PERSON	I saw once , long after his retirement .

		When
Phelps	PERSON	made his first appearance , at the West End , as
King John	ORGANIZATION	, he occupied the seat of honor in the royal box , and evidently followed the performance with the liveliest interest .

		He was liberal with applause , and when his old leading man , having been called before the curtain , bowed to him , stood up and bent low in answering salutation .

		He was a handsome figure .

		His tall form was still erect , and he carried his head with the long , white locks framing the stern , strong face very proudly .

		The impression we receive from Mr.
Towse	PERSON	's mere recital of the long succession of artists and plays that he has known , to say nothing of his formally expressed conclusions , is one of melancholy .

		We need no comment to con - vince us that real and substantial talent , not to say genius , has for at least a time departed from the stage .

		It is even difficult to believe , what the author himself professes to believe , that there are signs of a reawakening .

		His belief , however , is by no means a conviction .

		`` When
Edwin Booth	PERSON	made his final bow the curtain so far as the American stage was concerned fell also upon the legitimate drama .

		Whether it is to be raised again time will show . ''

		Only the youthful actor or critic who has never seen the giants of other days can look with complacency upon the present , or find the courage or effrontery to mention any modern figure in the same breath with Booth and
Irving	PERSON	, to say nothing of Phelps or
Salvini	PERSON	.

		Some of our modern critics many of whom never saw literary comedy or tragedy properly performed are very contemptuous in their references to the artificiality and unreality of the style of the old - time actors .

		Of course , it was artificial and unreal , but only in the sense that all the great masterpieces of imaginative fiction are unreal .

		It was a style deliberately cultivated , and developed through some centuries of experience to harmonize with , and give full effect to , incidents , thoughts , aspirations , and emotions outside the experience of common humanity .

		It did not , perhaps , always achieve its full purpose , but it came infinitely nearer to the realization of the fanciful than the ignoble and slovenly utterance and unregulated , spasmodic , and inexpressive gesture of the untaught and self-acting player ever can .

		It involved a laborious study of artistic principles , and it was abandoned because it was laborious ... Now , alas , the star himself or herself shines only with a fictitious glitter , the reflection of flaming and mendacious advertisement .

		Most of our contemporary theatrical valuations are ridiculously extravagant , and the stage itself , perhaps , is suffering quite as much from the false glamor with which the box - office agents and the daily press have conspired to invest it as from any other particular condition .

		It is the fashion to describe our second or third rate mummers in terms which would be flattering to a Siddons or a
Garrick	PERSON	, and to record their petty say - ings and doings as if these were actually matters of public importance and interest .

		How many of the names of existing stage luminaries which now con - front us on the street posters and in the newspapers will be remembered in the next generation ?

		The question is easily answered .

		We might add that the very term `` legitimate '' has come to be debased , denoting now only acted drama as distinguished from the movie .

		Possibly there are those who will think Mr.
Towse	PERSON	exacting .

		If he is slow to yield the highest praise to many actors who have been lauded almost without stint , it is because of the background against which he views all actors and performances .


Samuel Phelps	PERSON	and
Tommaso Salvini	PERSON	are the giant figures by which he takes the measurements of all the rest .

		Beside them , even Irving and Booth , to say nothing of a score of others ordinarily con - ceived of as representing ideal stature , are seen to be of something less than heroic size .

		The reason for this severity is found in a principle of criticism clearly set forth by the author : Hundreds of our players , and not a few of our stars , never dream of acting anybody but themselves .

		The consequence is that the spectators get no definite idea of Macbeth or Benedick , but only learn how Mr.
Smith	PERSON	or Mr.
Jones	PERSON	thinks he would comport himself in similar circumstances .

		In other words , the player who is content to express every character , no matter how diverse , in terms of his own individual habits , ideas , and impulses , trusting simply to external dis - guise for identification , is not a genuine impersonator or actor at all , although he may be himself an exceedingly interesting personality and uncommonly expert in self - illustration .

		In the many years that I have been writing about the theater this is one of the tests by which I have always abided in trying to form a just estimate of relative performances .

		A little reflection will show that the more marked are
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 the traits in the individual personality of the player , the more incumbent it is upon him to suppress them in characters to which they are not appropriate , especially when those characters have different and equally strongly marked traits of their own .

		The true creative power the possession of which , I hold , is the one infallible test of histrionic great - ness is only manifested when an actor can present a series of great or widely diverse characters without the obvious assertion of his individual self in any of them .

		Wide is the gulf between their -LSB- the old artists ' -RSB- sure and varied artistry and the accomplishment of modern mummers , whose one specialty is in the monotonous repetition of themselves .

		Those who resent unfavorable criticism of such favorites as
Maude Adams	PERSON	and Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	must remember that the critic is apply - , ing a test which excludes all but the highest order of genius .

		He does not fail to give credit to lesser first-class acting , and to greater second-class ; but he refuses the su - preme distinction to those whose art has been `` performance rather than embodiment . ''

		The champions of contemporary drama , too , must remember the background of time-tested liter - ary drama against which Mr.
Towse	PERSON	views the less substantial product of to-day .

		To read Mr.
Towse	PERSON	's book is to have one 's interest in both acted drama and literature stimulated .

		The text is made more vivid by forty full-page illustrations , presenting nearly one hundred noted artists of the stage , for the most part in the characters with which they are associated in the public mind .

		A portrait of
Edwin Booth	ORGANIZATION	makes a fitting frontispiece .

		A book so valuable in its kind as `` Sixty Years of the Stage , '' and especially one upon whose content the publishers themselves bestow such hearty praise , should have had a more attractive make-up .

		Its paper and binding give the impression of cheapness .

		THROUGH THE MISTS OF WAR .

		books as the source of inspiration , could lead to anything really sane and progressive .

		To - day it is a pleasure to call attention to Miss Key 's new book on the war , and to describe it as an admirable contribution to that sanity which this mad world so sorely needs .

		The very lack of any conspicuous brilliance of style , the absence of any striking originality , the restraint from all attempts at smartness , give the work a solidity and persuasive value all its own .

		We are not yet prepared to recant the earlier opinions ; but we recall how the Ibsen craze of thirty years ago , with its un - doubtedly unhealthy symptoms , led some of us to undervalue the contributions of that really great author .

		With the passage of time the ill considered , poorly balanced work of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and of
Ellen Key	PERSON	will be largely forgotten , and it will be remembered with gratitude that these writers labored long and successfully for the betterment of their kind .

		Miss Key is at one with
Eabindranath Tagore	PERSON	in regarding nationalism as the curse of the ages .

		She contrasts it with patriotism , and shows how in
1905 Norway	DATE	and
Sweden	LOCATION	were in danger of armed conflict owing to nationalistic impulses , but were restrained by that patriotism which looked to the welfare of the peoples concerned .

		This may be a rather forced interpretation of the two words ; but the contrast is genuine , fundamental , and of the first importance .

		It is seen , for instance , in the different conceptions of `` honor . ''

		To the nationalist the preservation of `` honor '' means attacking whoever may accidentally or purposely tread on the tail of the national coat .

		To the patriot in Miss Key 's sense it means the preservation of the moral and spiritual integrity of one 's country , in the face of all temptations to the contrary .

		The patriot , so defined , will fight , but for reasons widely divergent from those of the nationalist .

		They agree only on the subject of defence in case of attack .

		A large part of the book is taken up with discussions of the relation of women to the problems of the war .

		The various chapters , partly reprinted from newspapers , were apparently written as separate articles , and do not carry the thread of a consecutive argument .

		Two of the chapter-headings are almost identical : `` Women and War , '' and `` Woman and War . ''

		Nevertheless , the reit - eration resulting from this method of compila - tion is not without certain advantages , and the message as a whole stands out clearly enough .

		There is a dominant tone of optimism , and a clear faith in the future , but no failure to per - ceive existing evils and deficiencies .

		The chap - ter on `` Woman 's State of Mind , '' based on a 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	keen analysis of war psychology , is almost brutal in its recognition of the discouraging facts .

		Excessive suffering , like excessive bod - ily injury , leaves the individual helpless and hopeless ; the elasticity of mind so necessary for new efforts has gone for ever .

		On the other hand , those who have been profoundly stirred , but not wrecked , by extremes of per - sonal misery , may be expected to react vigor - ously : They have been confronted by the necessity for great and quick decisions ; they have dared every - thing when the issue was life or death .

		Their hearts have been enlarged by a stronger beat .

		They have experienced the heroic life of which they dreamed in their youth and even when , later on , life assumes its everyday aspects again it will never be monotonous and empty to these women .

		They have experienced the heights and the depths of life , and they will carry the stamp of these experiences .

		Thus the hope of the world may lie , not in those who have been ground beneath the mill ; not in those who , like the Americans , have been too remote to be transformed by the events of the war ; but in those who have faced the problems unflinchingly , and have come out unsubdued .

		Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	's `` The War and the Soul , '' also consisting of various articles assembled together , represents the attempt of a clergy - man of well-known liberal tendencies to interpret the problems of religion in the light of present events .

		The author 's radicalism is indicated by such a passage as this : `` Perfect anarchy and perfect socialism are one and the same , and both represent the Christian ideal in human relations . ''

		His religious tolerance is shown by the fact that he wishes the Pope to assume the lead of all Christian sects in an effort to establish permanent peace after the war .

		There is not a Church in
Christendom	LOCATION	that would not join in it -LSB- a proposed council -RSB- through its appointed representatives ... As the outcome of it there might be a tribunal established more author - itative and effective than that of the
Hague	LOCATION	, to say no more .

		Perhaps we should get even further than that in , shall we say , the direction of adjusting our religious differences too , and unifying civilization once more on that basis .

		Nevertheless , it seems ungracious to say it , Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	appears essentially anglican and insular in comparison with Miss Key .

		He can not escape from the tendency to theolog - ical argument , even when it leads nowhere in particular .

		Contrast the following passages : There is no escape from the proposition that what God permits He causes .

		He is an efficient cause , as the logicians say , of any event or series of events if He does no more than let them take place even if other wills set them going .

		Heaven could prevent anything it chose to prevent taking place on earth .

		If it does not do so it is because it does not wish to do so , because the alternative would bring greater evil in its train .

		God can not be the gentle heroism of
Edith Cavell	PERSON	and the vile deviltry of von Bissing .

		That the one derives from Him renders it impossible that He could be the other .

		He could not be both
Christ	LOCATION	and
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is something simple and direct in the way in which Miss Key , ignoring all such cobwebs , remarks that `` A few members of the clergy have been Christian enough to stand by God in spite of the repeated attempts to make Him a nationalist . ''

		RECEXT FICTION .

		* There is at present , as always , the desire that American literature , especially American novels , shall be really American .

		This ' desire has very often been expressed by foreigners who felt that somehow things American ought to be different from other things ; but it has also been felt by Americans .

		Just now one reads in various places , of the desire for `` native work , '' for the work of those `` who are not imitating other times and climes . ''

		Just what such work should be is a question .

		Are Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's `` Mary ` Gusta '' and Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's `` Penrod and Sam '' truly
Ameri	PERSON	- can , or are they `` imitations of other times and climes '' ?

		The last thing on this subject that 1 saw seemed to base itself on the idea that Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	was the bed-rock Ameri - can , but that there were others who were worth thinking of .

		THE DIAL published a year ago my view of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's latest novel ; it has recorded from time to time other searchings , more or less blind , for currents of Americanism in literature .

		At present

		We can point to other literatures which conduct themselves more properly , which are more national .

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	appears to me to be national enough .

		It has often been said that there are two Arnold Bennetts ; but if so , both are English .

		It is doubtless the same person that writes `` The Lion 's Share '' and `` These Twain , '' although one may guess that he writes the first with one lobe of his brain and the second with the other .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 467 in different moods .

		At any rate , he seems to be mostly himself and not to imitate other times and climes more than is necessary in using a language and ideas that have received a good deal of temporal end climatic influ - ence .

		However it be , he has two phases : there is the extravagant
Bennett	PERSON	that tells of the most impossible things and shows them to be perfectly natural and according to the great truths of life , and the commonplace
Bennett	PERSON	who tells of the most ordinary things and \ shows them to be full of the most emotional j adventure .

		People have rather settled down I into the idea that the latter
Bennett	PERSON	is the I real one , perhaps because they like best to have j the drabs and grays of their average experi - : ence made golden-pink and tawny .

		But both i kinds are real and both are very English . '

		; `` The Lion 's Share '' is of the latter kind , and an excellent example of it .

		It has exhilarating i action , more indeed than most novels of its I kind ; but it has also those moments of vision , those utterances of great truths about life , and ; those flashes of insight that we associate with j the serious Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	.

		`` The Lion 's Share '' is the story of a young woman who wishes to have a good time in life ?

		; or perhaps we should say to be happy .

		She !

		wishes all sorts of good times , all sorts of happiness , at least , so she says .

		She wishes j not to be a monomaniac , to be deeply in j earnest after one thing , but to have every - j thing , to have not merely a husband but other j things that she likes too ; she has an appetite | for life , wants all the sensations there are , i wants , in short , `` the lion 's share . ''

		There | have been such people in fiction before , but Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	had the quaint notion of taking for his lion a young Englishwoman of the present day .

		If we look at the book very seriously we are likely to say that it shows a conception of life , a range of sensations , that has been a good deal widened in
England	LOCATION	by the
last two years	DATE	.

		Audrey would have been ready for the war when it came , had it come in her time .

		She tastes the sensations of the artist world and of political action , of the studio life on a few francs a day , of the aris - tocratic life of motor car and yacht , and so on .

		To tell the truth , it probably does not matter much to her just what world she lives in , provided she is able to maintain a con - I tinued current of emotional vitality .

		All this Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	might have presented in the simplest forms and with the most sedate col - i ors ; but he did .

		not wish to , and therefore he I imagined a restricted English girl left inde - !

		pendent of family and with great wealth .

		She j is thus able to hurl herself into the art world i of
Paris	LOCATION	and into the political machinations of the suffragette movement .

		These circum - stances are of course glittering and amusing though not of serious importance .

		What is of importance -LRB- if we may violate the idea of the book by using such a word -RRB- is that , in both of these spheres , as in others , there are moments , there are people that give you the feeling of reality , of a window open on life .

		Rosamond , the thinly veiled leader of the Votes-for-women movement , how excellent -LRB- though somewhat exaggerated -RRB- is her atti - tude !


Jane Foley	PERSON	, full of the child-like happi - ness of the devotee ; Musa with his direct musical nature , these people impress one , not as puppets in an extravaganza , but as real indications of the possibilities of the human soul .

		And so Audrey herself ; it is not so much that she is a great character , or even a character at all , as that she accepts one chance after another in life as a real possi - bility .

		Such things are extremely interesting .

		They art not especially English ; in fact , they are much more interesting than anything would be that was especially English , at least to us and the world in ` general .

		In the eighties there was a good deal of dis - paragement of English fiction by those who compared it with the fiction of other countries .

		It was about the time that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	was becom - ing known outside
Russia	LOCATION	, when there were a number of French novelists more widely read than are any to-day , and when realists of interest were to be found in all sorts of places otherwise not very familiar to our novel-reading public in
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Norway	LOCATION	.

		Things have changed since then ; there have been more English novelists of real note for one thing , and for another , probably there was something about the new-found for - eigners that was not of perennial interest .

		It is true that even to-day there are those who think that the best fiction is continental ; it may be so , but I fancy that the real result of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's explorations was not so much to give English novels a minor place in our interests as to divert attention to the fiction writers of other countries .

		I wish I could convey the particular char - acter of the work of
Miss Selma Lagerlof	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can not say that the quality is of herself because I have read but few of her books ; I can not say that it is Swedish because I know but little of that country .

		But whatever it be , there it is , a quality that no one could mistake for English or American or indeed for anything else than what it is .

		Her books do not seem like novels at all and yet they certainly have the unity of emotional effect that makes a novel different from a series of sketches or stories .

		They deal with what 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	seems insignificant and trivial ; yet their magic transmutes the trivial into the important .

		Perhaps that is because
Miss Lagerlof	PERSON	is her - self and writes of what is to her , life .

		But to do that and to be interesting about it is one of the great things of modern literature .

		It should not be difficult for a man of ability to interest us in a young lady who had fifty thousand a year and sought the emotions of life among the art students of
Paris	LOCATION	and the determined militants of
England	LOCATION	.

		But it would not seem easy to interest people of other lands and other kinds of life in the love for his daughter of an old peasant in an out - of-the-way part of
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		Yet such is Miss
Lagerlof	PERSON	's achievement apparently an easy achievement in `` The Emperor of
Portu	LOCATION	- gallia . ''

		In the multitude of translations at hand to-day , I will mention only one other , `` The Hungry Stones '' by Sir
Eabindranath Tagore	PERSON	.

		One can not in a few words give much idea of these stories by the great Indian poet .

		They are for the most part stories of not very remarkable Indian life .

		But it is not the east - ern manners and customs , the oriental figures of speech and modes of expression , the Indian places and people , the matters of costume and usage that make the deep effect of the book ; indeed , these matters are to readers of our part of the world rather confusing than other - wise .

		The holding power of this book -LRB- like that of the others so very different -RRB- lies in its sense of truth and of life .

		Of course it is a kind of life very different from that which is current with us .

		These stories are of a life that passes on from generation to gen - eration in forms unknown by those whose eyes are closed and whose ears are stopped the life often of children , poets , blind people , humble servants , beggars ; of love or devotion ; of old places , forests , villages .

		Still , the thing that makes the book remarkable -LRB- for it cer - tainly is remarkable -RRB- is not that it is Indian , but that it is very human .

		If we return to our own shores after some such tour of international fiction , we shall be rather at a loss to know just what we have of the same sort of interest .

		Bennett ,
Lagerlof	PERSON	,
Tagore	PERSON	these names are probably better known to us than is the name of any present American novelist to the readers of
England	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	, or
Bengal	LOCATION	.

		That is due to several facts that have little to do with the relative excellence of our fiction-writers ; as for instance that many more people in
America	LOCATION	like to read foreign fiction than is the case in
Bengal	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	, or even
England	LOCATION	.

		But aside from such things , one does not know just whom to point to as our representative
Ameri	PERSON	- can writer .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	, who has just pub - lished `` El Supremo , '' is in some ways obvi - ously not such a writer .

		He might be thought by those who are particular to be `` imitating other times and climes '' ; he is apparently , however , `` a live American artist '' and as such of interest .

		It may properly be said , first , that Mr.
White	PERSON	has done a great deal in being able to do anything at all .

		In spite of all our train - ing in the exotic , the out-of-the-way , the bizarre , the average American reader would naturally refuse to be interested in a histor - ical novel about
Paraguay	LOCATION	.

		Merely to be told that `` El Supremo '' was the Dictator of Para - guay , and that he was the most remarkable American of history , is , with the majority , to be warned off the subject .

		I own to such a prejudice , and my observation leads me to think myself by no means peculiar in that respect .

		Yet , in spite of the disinclination of any intelligent reader even to think of a long historical novel about
Paraguay	LOCATION	, Mr.
White	PERSON	achieves the feat of making a singularly inter - esting book , one that people will read with intense pleasure .

		Besides surmounting this difficulty , which lies chiefly with his readers , Mr.
White	PERSON	has certain difficulties that he has created himself .

		The most obvious is that his book is too long .

		I know that the objection to a long book is illogical ; I do not myself object to this book because it is long , but rather would wish it much longer ; still , it is really a mistake to do in seven hundred pages what most people want done in half that number .

		Then , besides this inability -LRB- as it would seem -RRB- to construct , Mr.
White	PERSON	has difficulties of creation .

		Francia , the Dictator , is not much of a person : he is only great in our minds because Mr.
White	PERSON	tells us that he is ; he really does or says noth - ing which has the flash of greatness in it ; all his power over
Paraguay	LOCATION	rests in his contin - ually having people shot at dawn and avoid - ing all attempts at assassination .

		Besides , Mr.
White	PERSON	has no great gift at rendering the con - ditions of place ; in spite of some descriptions , he does not give us much idea of material
Paraguay	LOCATION	; no such idea , that is , as would be given by one who had a genius for discerning the spirit of place .

		We may thus easily dispose of Mr.
White	PERSON	's ability to make a plot , draw a character , or render the atmosphere of place ; it still remains to show why , in spite of all that , he should be able to interest people in the doings of an imaginary New Englander among the people of
Paraguay	LOCATION	at a time when
Paraguay	LOCATION	hardly existed , save on the map .

		The reason for this fact , the reason that Mr.
White	PERSON	has written a fine book is that he is what has
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 469 recently been called `` a live American artist '' ; he is a live artist because he possesses a remarkable historical imagination , of greater scope than intensity perhaps , but still suffi - cient to give him that sense of reality which he succeeds in passing on to his readers .

		As to why he is American , there the difficulties are too much for me .

		Perhaps it is because , like his own character ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, he is a very practical person and knows thoroughly what he is talking about and is deeply inter - ested in it .

		Certainly the book lives and we live in it .

		If Francia is somewhat unreal to us , he probably was so to the world which he dominated .

		But that world , Mr.
White	PERSON	makes us feel it .

		From the very beginning , from that wonderful dinner at the
Mayorgas	ORGANIZATION	's which one can not attempt to describe , one follows
Hawthorne	PERSON	in his investigations and adventures as though one shared the life about him .

		Wholly unlike the other books just spoken of , this novel has the same sense of reality .

		It has the vitality which is so much more in fiction than skill in plot , character , or setting , or even than that feeling of race or nation , which -LRB- as it appears to me -RRB- is so often swallowed up in the general sense of humanity .

		Perhaps some time Mr.
White	PERSON	will be so much interested in the life of our own country and our own supreme ruler that he will want to present it to the world .

		Then j we shall have something more American , or at least more our kind of American .

		But I I doubt whether it will thereby be better then `` El Supremo . ''

		EDWAED
E. HALE	PERSON	.

		XOTES ox NEW FICTIOX .

		In `` Dead Yesterday '' -LRB- Doran ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Mary Agnes Hamilton	PERSON	has written a novel of contem - porary
London	LOCATION	which considers the war with a sane appreciation of its reactions upon individual character .

		The story revolves about
Nigel Strode	PERSON	, a journalist , brilliant , indolent , and successful , as success goes in that mildly bohemian life of Fleet Street and
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		During a brief holiday in
Florence	LOCATION	he meets Mrs.
Leonard	PERSON	, a writer , with whom he would have fallen in love had not her analytic manner of thought put too great a strain upon his own intellectual habits .

		He responds to her charm , but evades matching his own intelli - gence with hers .

		Later on , when he finds in her daughter the same charm without the mother 's maturity of mind , he allows himself to indulge in love .

		His is an interesting character , and one especially typical of upper middle-class
England	LOCATION	.

		Three years ago there were thousands like him , and their true worth would never have been discovered had not the war tested them with fire .

		It is not fair to give the reader more than an inkling of the fine study which this novel offers of English life under the reactions of war .

		If the book at times lacks ease and grace , it possesses swift action and keen insight into human character .

		Those passages which concern the early days of the war are memorable .

		This is a book for the serious reader , and one well worth his undertaking .

		It is not often that the work of an American writer attracts attention because of beauty of style .

		That , unhappily , is a quality which our `` reading public '' does not desire of its favorites .

		Mr.
James Branch Cabell	PERSON	, however , has this attri - bute to such a degree that , were he not a master story-teller , still his work must command the enthusiasm of the discriminating reader .

		In `` The Certain Hour '' -LRB- McBride ,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , he has selected an idea which requires his utmost artistry with words .

		The volume consists of ten sketches which , as he points out in a prefatory essay of rare irony anent the public , are not short-stories .

		Perhaps they might be described as fragments patterned upon the same psychological situation in the lives of various poets , finding their individual color in that of the personalities involved .

		The idea of selecting that certain hour in which a man comes face to face with himself revealing the temper of his spirit , is one which would only occur to the inspired artist .

		There is in these sketches a wistful and magical quality of sentiment and a delicacy of workmanship which can not fail to arouse pleasurable emotions in anyone who recognizes the master touch .

		And as stories , many of them are no less than thrilling , and that without the trick - ery of the magazine writer .

		Mr.
Harris Dickson	PERSON	is known chiefly , perhaps , as a writer of tales of colored folk of the modern South , tales that appeal alike to those who know his subject , and those whose ignorance of it adds curiosity to interest .

		In `` The House of Luck '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- he shows himself as a novelist of no mean degree .

		With
Vicksburg	LOCATION	as the setting and the early thirties as the time , he has written a story of the hectic , high-living , hard-hitting days when the great river was the playground and battle ground and market-place and hiding place for planters and gamblers and `` speculators '' and exiled French Koyalists .

		The book approximates an historical romance in that it concerns itself with an almost forgotten episode in the frustration of the gigantic plot engineered by the leader of a band of horse-thieves , negro stealers and assorted ruffians , wholesale pillage and massacre , under cover of a slave insurrection , and escape to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The book is written with skill and feeling .

		Mr.
Dickson	PERSON	's work has been of the kind that makes the reader want more , and the present volume is no exception .

		After reading Mr.
Louis U. Wilkinson	PERSON	's `` The Buffoon '' -LRB- Knopf ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , one is inclined to won - der why so many writers trouble themselves , and often their readers as well , straining for originality of plot , when human nature itself affords the best entertainment .

		Perhaps those writers who occupy themselves so entirely with `` action '' have not Mr.
Winkinson	PERSON	's cunning in character analysis and portrayal .

		This story concerns
Edward Raynes	PERSON	during a period of two or three weeks in which 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 30	DATE	the comfortable monotony of his batchelorhood is interrupted by a human comet in the person of
Jack Welch	PERSON	, a radical lecturer .

		Under
Welch	PERSON	's stimulation
Raynes	PERSON	's sluggish mentality is aroused ; he is introduced to an entirely new set of ideas ; has a brilliant though brief experience with the apostles of `` new '' art , poetry , painting , and what not ; becomes infatuated with the `` Queen '' of the sacred circle , and then relapses into his former mode of living with enough to think about all the rainy days of his life .

		For the most part the characters would be unpleasant were it not for the author 's constant mockery , the zest with which he quite heartlessly illuminates their ephem - eral life .

		It is this quality of penetrating humor which has sharpened his wit and if one enjoys that elusive cynicism which made Wilde the master of what we may term `` prose de societie , '' he will find much to his liking in this story of English town and country life .

		There is more than an evanescent brilliance here , however .

		There is also ruthless veracity and a certain brutal sanity which gives the book a fresh and invigorating interest .

		There is just a bit of sentimentality in `` The Shining Adventure '' by
Dana Burnet	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	,
$ 1.30	MONEY	-RRB- but not enough to cloy .

		`` The King , '' a chivalrous little boy living in a wealthy household , just off
Gramercy Park	LOCATION	, buys the park with pen - nies from his pig-bank that the poor children may have access to it .

		He adventures into
O'Connor	PERSON	's Alley , fights and vanquishes the juvenile ruler thereof , organizes an army and marches at the head of it to his purchased kingdom , with a drum and a `` First Hand Harmonica '' providing satis - factorily martial music .

		Of course , he finds a Queen , in the person of a little crippled girl , and defends a `` Bad Woman '' from the taunts and tin - cans of his army and is fed and lodged over-night by her .

		But these things are to be expected , as is the conversion of
Miss Philomena	LOCATION	from effi - ciency to humanity in social service , and her sub - sequent mating with the Doctor , who , like all book doctors who know `` life '' and `` society '' as well , is gruff and ironical and kind-hearted .

		One would miss these touches were they absent .

		No `` story for grown-ups '' is complete without them .

		But Mr.
Dana	PERSON	has given a craftsmanlike quality to his book that raises it a little beyond the ordinary mass of work on similar themes .

		All too many tales of adventure are devoid of anything even approaching the portrayal and development of character .

		Incident takes the place of analysis , and the `` punch '' and its preparation leave no room for anything quieter and less artifi - cial .

		However , in `` The Snow-Burner '' -LRB- Doran ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , Mr.
Henry Oyen	PERSON	has sketched life-like , memorable characters , and has portrayed the development of one in particular against a back - ground of fighting and toiling in a far-north lumber camp , with enough of artistry to raise his book beyond the plane of ordinary stories of adventure .

		True , the component parts of the whole are a little too readily discernible , as , for instance , the hero 's change from footless youth to purposeful manhood , and there is an air of striv - ing for high cerebral altitudes at times , but the book is real and does not try credulity overmuch , nor does it suggest , as its genesis , the keenly inspirational dollar mark .


Anton Chekhov	PERSON	, who has been called `` the Rus - sian Maupassant , '' is better known in this country by his plays than by his very excellent stories .

		A new volume , `` The Darling and Other Stories , '' translated by
Constance Garnett	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , serves partly to bridge the lapse in our acquaintance with his work .

		Chekhov pos - sesses in a marked and well-balanced degree the ability to observe life and all life 's richness of human relationships without passing judgment upon it or upon the characters which he portrays so skilfully .

		This ideal attitude for the short - story writer is one rarely achieved in our own land of rigid definitions , but that it goes not wholly unappreciated , the vogue of Russian literature proves .

		The heroine of the title story , `` The Darling , '' is Olenka , who , having buried and bewept two husbands , takes a lover , and losing him adopts his son , a pathetic little figure in his large school cap .

		The transference of her affections is not inconstancy , but transmutation ; from the bestowal of them she draws the breath of life itself .

		Did Chekhov intend a criticism of the Olenka type of woman ?

		Was he , in a left-handed way , setting before us his ideal for the new woman ,
Olenka	ORGANIZATION	's antithesis ?

		So Tolstoy thought .

		But it hardly matters what he intended .

		What he gave is a piece of the very stuff of humanity .

		His Russians are so single-hearted , in spite of all their talk , in their acceptance of life as it is !

		They appreciate , one and all , the satisfaction of non - resistance .

		`` Why struggle ?

		It is all the same , '' they say .

		Life to the individual is not of such ill-proportioned importance as it is to us
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons .

		Theirs is an older perhaps a saner view .

		At any rate r
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	draws from his philosophy much of truth and of pure poetry .

		`` The Tutor 's Story '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- is an hitherto unpublished novel by the late
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		As explained in the preface , the half - completed manuscript was found only last year by the novelist 's daughter , Mrs.
Mary St. Leger Harrison	PERSON	, whose nom de guerre ,
Lucas Malet	PERSON	, is not unfamiliar in the world of fiction .

		The task of drawing together the threads of the story , embellishing the incident , rounding off the char - acters , touching up the scenery , and bringing the whole to a successful close , consistent with the probable intention of the author , has been assumed by Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	.

		The fruit of her efforts is an excellent novel , refreshing indeed in this day of machine-made plots and custom-made characters .

		Manifest throughout the work is the revolt of
Kingsley	PERSON	against existing social evils , in this case , the intrigues incident to life at an English nobleman 's country estate .

		And this is the lesson which is portrayed in the story of a young tutor 's love for his aristocratic and temperamental young pupil , Lord Hartover .

		`` The Tutor 's Story '' offers more than an opportunity to judge the faithful - ness of the revision and completion of
Kingsley	PERSON	's notes ; it is a novel which never lags in interest , and more , a novel which will be remembered .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 471 English professors who would persuade their disciples that novels should follow certain fixed principles of `` unity and coherence , '' directness , congruity , and character-economy , will hardly se - lect '' Barnacles , '' by
J. MacDougall	PERSON	Hay -LRB-
Doran	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , as a sterling example .

		They are more likely to condemn it , as violating their most pre - cious tenets .

		`` Barnacles , '' the book , like Bar - nacles , its chief character , is `` different , ' 1 save in j one respect , it is a love story .

		If the reader could follow the ingenuous
Highland	LOCATION	hero , `` one of God 's own innocents , '' through his eventful career in the town of
Paisley	LOCATION	, and see him remedy , as he did , some of the misery of the world , the novel might take rank as a very pretty character study .

		But the unstinting author has thrown in for good meas - ure too much extraneous material .

		Indeed , the , book combines two plots .

		One concerns the career ; of Barnacles , the hero , who feels that `` there is ; something wrong with the world '' ; the other in - volves the domestic infelicity of the talented and sympathetic
Martha Crawford	PERSON	as the result of her marriage to
Ganson Normanshire	PERSON	, artist , maniac , and Sadist .

		That
Martha	PERSON	should eventually break with
Normanshire	PERSON	and later marry the lowly Bar - nacles , seems hardly acceptable as a solution of | her problem .

		The less exacting reader may excuse this ineptitude on the grounds that
Martha	PERSON	and , Barnacles are unusual creatures , other-world folk , like the other characters of the tale .

		But both are extreme in their strangeness , too ex - treme to be compatible the one with the other .

		There is charm to `` Barnacles '' so much must be conceded .

		Many descriptive passages reveal real fineness on the part of the author .

		One finds a new and wholly pleasing beauty , emanating from the life of the simple Barnacles .

		And one is dis - ' appointed that the tale is not simply a series of j episodes , as its mechanical arrangement seems to promise it will be .

		Though
Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews	PERSON	is best known to us for her `` Perfect Tribute '' and | the more recent and very moving sketch of `` The j Three Things , '' many of her shorter stories are j quite as well worth the reading .

		As such we I count `` A Political Tip '' and the lighter `` Taki 's Career , '' published with other stories in `` The ; Eternal Feminine '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Mrs. ,
Andrews	PERSON	possesses the strange combination of a good , humorous imagination , with a strain of mys - ticism such as appears in `` The Healer '' of the same volume .

		Nothing could have pointed out more subtly than her collection the advance , the change of style -LRB- for it is no less than that -RRB- in the short-story writing of the last few years .

		The straight love-story of certain of these reprints , is j supplanted in the author 's later work by a more highly developed plot , depending to a greater degree upon suspense , quick turns , problems of ; current interest , or humor .

		Variety is the word .

		We demand something more than `` heart interest '' ; ' we want to be surprised , and we want also some - , thing that hits us very closely , whether this some - , thing be suffrage or cooks , the war or Fifth j Avenue .

		Mrs.
Andrews	PERSON	gives us this sustaining touch , backing it by stories of good construction i and of fairlv universal interest .

		I. BIOGRAPHY AND REMINISCENCES .

		Idealism and an indomitable energy in carrying out his idealistic projects seem to have been the main characteristics of
Heinrich Conried	ORGANIZATION	.

		These qualities , at any rate , are emphasized in `` The Life of Heinrich Conried , '' by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	.

		The biographer seems not to have had any intimate acquaintance with the famous impres - ario , but he has had , in preparing his book , the valuable assistance of Mr.
Conried	PERSON	's son and of others near to him in his life time and qualified to impart something of his personality to the pages descriptive of his life and work .

		It is an engaging story of precocious talent bent on suc - cess and never admitting the possibility of failure .

		Head of a travelling company of actors at eight - een , theatre-manager at twenty-one , and strong both in executive ability and as a character actor , Conried naturally welcomed the call to
America	LOCATION	at twenty-three and was not slow to recognize the possibilities open to him in the metropolis of the new country .

		His rise to the management of the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	and his triumphs in that responsible position are well related by his biographer .

		Eighteen portraits are inserted , but no index puts the finishing touch to the well-made volume .

		A long life and a happy one , which is far better than a short life and a merry one , is passed in fragmentary review by Mrs.
Joseph Hobson	PERSON	-LRB-
Elizabeth Christophers Hobson	PERSON	-RRB- in a posthumous work reprinted from a privately circulated sheaf of autobiographic chapters written at the repeated request of friends .

		`` Recollections of a Happy Life '' gives in a bright and informal way the more significant passages from the eventful and useful life of Mrs.
Hobson	PERSON	.

		A memorable up-bringing , an early marriage , much travel and many sojourns in foreign lands , philanthropic activity , especially in hospital work , and , through it all , intercourse and friendship with persons of note in many paths of life of such is the substance of the two hundred and fifty pages of the book .

		To the student of literature no passage will prove of greater interest than the true story of the nun who has been made famous in fiction by
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	in his `` Casa Braccio . ''

		Mrs.

		Little personal anecdotes about the illustrious , comic touches , pathetic incidents , tragic occur - rences , or otherwise appealing passages in their lives , are always good reading .

		Mr.
T. H. S. Escott	PERSON	's reminiscent volume , `` Great Victorians : Memories and Personalities , '' is notably of this inviting character .

		Soldiers , churchmen , authors , statesmen , scientists , and other persons of interest 472 THE DIAL -LSB-

		If his reminiscences are not all first-hand , they are all readable and leave the impression of one gifted with a remarkable memory for those little illu - minative traits and incidents that help to make real for us the personages in whom all the world is interested , but whom only a small part of the world has ever seen .

		Here is a characteristic utterance from
Carlyle	LOCATION	, addressed to the author : `` You may hear it said of me that I am cross - grained and disagreeable .

		Dinna believe it .

		Only let me have my own way exactly in everything , with all about me precisely what I wish , and a sunnier or pleasanter creature does not live . ''

		But it is not quotation or anecdote alone that fixes the reader 's attention .

		The author writes well when drawing more purely from his own resources .

		His portrait appears as frontispiece .

		Sons inherit from their mothers , daughters from their fathers ; or thus it appears in many instances .

		Mrs.
Ella Flagg Young	PERSON	's father , a skilled mechanic and reputed the fastest workman in the sheet metals throughout the region of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	, certainly handed on to his talented daughter something of his own ability to see clearly , to reason correctly , and to waste no time in false moves .

		Manual training in its large essen - tials she got at her father 's forge , from watching his methods ; and it is significant that many years later , when she was district superintendent of schools in
Chicago	LOCATION	, she was invited to assume the management of a great manufacturing establish - ment because , as the owners declared , `` she knew more about its affairs than anyone else . ''

		The life and work of this gifted woman form the subject of Professor
John T. McManis	PERSON	's timely volume , ``
Ella Flagg Young	PERSON	and a Half - Century of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Public Schools . ''

		Naturally it is the pub - lic work rather than the private and personal life of Mrs.
Young	PERSON	that fills the bulk of the book .

		She is absorbed in her work and shrinks from being made the theme of a detailed biographical study .

		Yet her personality shines in Mr.

		More cordial commendation could not be desired by any writer than that with which Mr.

		`` A more energetic , competent , trained journalist , '' he declares , `` I have never met , nor a more loyal and steadfast friend . ''

		And the book , he says , `` may well stand as perhaps the most complete and the most trustworthy record of the stage for recent years . ''

		Yes , it is a capital book , but not , in any strict sense , a record of the stage .

		A book of intimate recollections of famous
New England	LOCATION	writers belonging to our Augustan age can not fail to be a book worth reading .

		Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	, in `` A Little Book of Friends , '' revives her memories of Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	,
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	,
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	,
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	,
Rose Terry Cooke	PERSON	,
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	, and others , with passing glimpses of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and many besides .

		It is a book of the same pleasing quality as Mrs. Fields 's `` Authors and Friends . ''

		One of the best chapters is that on
Mary Abigail Dodge	PERSON	, who was always `` Gail '' to her friends .

		Does it dawn upon many readers of
Gail Hamilton	PERSON	that she must get her pseudonym from the last syllable of her first name and the place of her birth ?

		Not many more reminiscent volumes like this by Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	can , in the nature of things , be expected ; hence its interest and value .

		Miss
Clara E. Laughlin	PERSON	's `` Reminiscences of
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	'' is the fruit of a friend - ship extending over twenty years .

		It began with a rather pert request for a poem , and seems to have ended in mutual esteem and lasting friend - ship .

		To have sat at table with Mr.
Riley	PERSON	and a few of his chosen intimates , with `` Bobb ''
Burdette	PERSON	to put the witty poet on his mettle , must have been a treat .

		Such joyful symposia , and other memorable conclaves , with frequent
Riley	PERSON	- isms of rare quality , go into the making of
Miss Laughlin	LOCATION	's highly readable little book .

		Many , it is to be hoped , will note with approval the poet 's `` bitterness against those who spoke contemp - tuously of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's flowing rhyme and rhythm , as if his thought must be less noble because it could be understood without a ` key ' ; and as if his poetry must have been effortless because it could be memorized so easily . ''

		The book is duly fur - nished with a portrait of
Riley	PERSON	, and a bit of his exuberant fun appears in facsimile of his hand - writing on the paper wrapper .

		Strange alternations of good and ill fortune have pursued Mr.
James D. Corrothers	PERSON	through life , and the story of these vicissitudes from his own pen is well worth reading .

		`` In Spite of Handicap '' he appropriately names his book , the handicap in his case being the admixture of Negro blood in his veins .

		Indian and Scotch-Irish elements also enter into his ancestry , and the scion of this triple stock is evidently a staunch American and a man of most admirable pluck and energy .

		Those who know him only as a poet will be surprised to learn how many kinds of work , from floor-scrubbing to preaching , have engaged his energies .

		One of his best chapters is on `` Interesting People and Unusual Experiences , '' and another is devoted to `` Dunbar ,
Douglass	PERSON	and
Riley	PERSON	. ''

		A pathetic chapter describes a crushing disaster that compelled the author , in his mature years , to begin life anew .

		An occasional sugges - tion of `` fine writing , '' like `` prior to '' for `` before , '' excites remonstrance ; otherwise it is

		Several portraits of the author , with other illustrations , are inserted .

		In the delightful
Aubrey	PERSON	's `` Brief Lives '' it is recorded of
William Oughtred	PERSON	, parson and mathe - matician , that he received numerous young men as pupils and taught and boarded them free of j charge .

		Among many illustrations of the good I rector 's schoolmasterly ways and kindness of heart j occurs the following : `` He could not endure to see !

		a scholar write an ill hand ; he taught them all ; presently to mend their hands . ''

		All this and much more will be found in the agreeable and j instructive account of this inventive genius and j amiable man by Professor
Florian Cajori	PERSON	, of

		``
William Oughtred	PERSON	, a Great j Seventeenth-Century Teacher of Mathematics '' directs attention more particularly to the works of the man than to his uneventful life ; but the few pages given to his human qualities and relations take the reader captive .

		The mystery of Archduke

		To the many existing accounts of the Meyerling incident , the more or less plausible surmises as to the truth of the matter , there is now added the narrative of one who describes himself as the Archduke 's intimate personal attendant or private secretary , and whose revelations -LRB- `` The Last Days of the Archduke Rudolph '' -RRB- are , as the title-page announces , `` edited by

		Insinuations of

Berlin	LOCATION	.

		And so , though one is about as wise at the end as at the beginning , it is not bad reading for those that like that kind .

		Mr.

		Of the docile and amiable Hawaiian Mrs.

Hawaii	LOCATION	: Scenes and Impressions , '' as follows : `` Civilization has killed him , as is its way : vice and disease came in with the sea-captains and sailors of all the globe , and the missionaries finished the work .

		As far as one can make out , the missionaries were more responsible than Captain Cook or the New Bed - ford whalers , for the Hawaiian is dying , quite literally , of clothes . ''

		That is , the diseases prev - alent among clothes-wearers , and unknown to the children of nature , are now exterminating the innocent natives , who present a pathetically inter - esting appearance in Mrs.
Gerould	PERSON	's random narra - tive of her sojourn among them .

		Her first chapter has to do chiefly with
Honolulu	LOCATION	as the `` melting - pot '' of various races , but a very different vessel from that in which the heterogeneous elements of our American population are fused together ; her second chapter describes by-ways in
Hawaii	LOCATION	, out - lying islands , seaports , and settlements ; and her closing section , which makes about a third of the book , gives an account of the leper colony on
Molokai	LOCATION	, an account much more detailed and inter - esting than the ordinary visitor to
Hawaii	LOCATION	would be able to give , and far less depressing in its gen - eral tone than might have been expected .

		Many half-tone illustrations accompany the narrative , and are , in not a few instances , so interesting that the reader would like to find on the opposite page or somewhere near the picture a full account of the thing pictured ; but in this he is too often disappointed .

		`` A Hoosier Holiday , '' written in Mr.

Booth	PERSON	's frequent drawings by the way sketches of a pleasant softness and dreaminess , done in charcoal or crayon add charm to the whole .

		For a man not very much over forty , Mr.

		One reads him always with enjoyment , but this same Hoosier-holiday narrative might have been made equally interest - ing and equally true to the facts without any indulgence in what at times savors of a contemp - tuous superiority to the innocent and simple joys of human existence .

		ABT AND HANDICRAFT .

		There is in Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's work something of the splendid virility and courageousness which made Walt Whitman the most significant figure which
America	LOCATION	has yet produced .

		There is no more fearless an artist to-day than he , nor one with keener insight .

		Were Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	less a master in his chosen craft , he would doubtless be less convincing .

		But when one has proven himself so great , as has Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	, in the conventional fields of the etcher and lithographer , he may be trusted when his vision leads him farther afield .

		His unique contribution to contemporary art lies in his exploitation of modern industrial conditions .

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	is essentially of the twentieth cen - tury of
America	LOCATION	.

		He is a bluff , outspoken Yankee in art .

		He is not ashamed to work , he respects work , he glories in it .

		The result is that he has glorified labor .

		He has perceived the dramatic , new-age aspects of oil-fields , sky - scrapers , smelteries , and has recorded his percep - tions convincingly .

		Consequently `` The Wonder of Work '' -LRB-
Lippincott	LOCATION	,
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is perhaps the most interesting of the many collections of Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's drawings , since it consists entirely of etchings and lithographs in which the artist is most fully himself .

		These fifty-two plates cover nearly the entire industrial world , from the oil-wells of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and the mines of Butte , to the power houses at
Niagara	LOCATION	, the docks at
Hamburg	LOCATION	and the factories of
Sheffield	LOCATION	.

		The brief text accompanying each plate gives delightful glimpses of Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	at work ; they are full of gay chatter , of enthusiasm and delight in finding unex - pected bits , or discovering the particular thing he has sought .

		And by way of saying what he means , Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	is almost as great an artist with words as with his pen .

		If you scratch the skin of a painter , you find a man underneath .

		Such at least is the belief of Mr.
J. Walker McSpadden	PERSON	, whose book on `` Famous Painters of
America	LOCATION	, '' not wholly new to readers , `` treats primarily of the picturesque and human sides of its subjects . ''

		No technical jargon irritates the general reader in these anec - dotal pages , where lively dialogue and amusing incident engage the attention without necessarily evoking troublesome queries as to the authenticity of it all .

		If the discursive chapters excite interest and make more familiar the names that head them , that at any rate is a desirable end in itself .

		Four - teen artists , each neatly characterized as
Benjamin West	PERSON	, the painter of destiny ;
John Singleton Copley	PERSON	, the painter of early gentility ;
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	, the painter of presidents ;

		`` Old Pottery and Porcelain '' is the title of his book , which he opens with the prefatory remark , noteworthy on account of its form if not also because of its substance , that `` in this , the second volume of the series , pottery , which , although at first crudely modelled and merely sun - baked , has always been deemed essential in every home , is treated upon .

		England has won no great measure of fame from the invention of artistic designs in furniture , but she has placed her stamp upon patterns adopted from other countries ; and among the distinctive styles attributed to her by reason of this impress is that known as Jacobean , heavy and massive in build and running much to a superfluity of stout legs and an excess of spiral carving .

		OUTSTANDING CARTOONS .

		The measure of a man may safely be taken by his sense of humor , particularly where he himself is involved .

		So with nations .

		The cartoons which a nation produces , particularly at such a time as the present , have a peculiar , not to say , significant interest .

		One of the most interesting volumes of the many which have recently been compiled is that entitled `` International Cartoons of the War '' -LRB- Button ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , edited by
H. Pearl Adam	PERSON	.

		Among the sixty-odd drawings contained in this volume are representative cartoons from English , Italian , American , Japanese , Russian , Polish , French , and German sources .

		Assembled thus in a single book they afford the student of humanity a deal of information .

		A somewhat gayer volume is
Heath Robinson	PERSON	's `` Hunlikely ! ''

		-LRB-
Buckworth	LOCATION	,

		.

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	has long been justly famous for his delighful drolleries in the
London	LOCATION	`` Sketch , '' but aside from the quaint humor of his ingenious designs for `` Armored Bayonet Curlers for Spoiling the Temper of the Enemy 's Steel '' or for `` Screw - stoppers for Plugging the Muzzles of the Enemy 's Rifles , '' there is no lack of appreciation for the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 479 foibles of his countrymen .

		Certainly a nation which can at a time of ordeal laugh good - humoredly , has in it elements of greatness !

		In strong contrast with certain German tendencies , there is here nothing of boorishness or ill-temper .

		A fair laugh and a hearty one !

		It is no small satisfaction to discover that our own Cesare of the ``
New York	LOCATION	Sun , '' holds his own as a cartoonist of international events .

		He has long been one of the outstanding cartoonists this side the water , but his cartoons of the war give him more than local significance .

		The best of these have been collected in `` One Hundred Car - toons '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	,
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, and every American interested in the art of the cartoon can not but find this collection of more than temporary inter - est. .

		Aside from a splendid technique ,
Cesare	ORGANIZATION	is possessed of a poetic fervor , imagination , and a keen feeling for beauty .

		Many of these are draw - ings of a very noble order , qualified by a sentiment that is not mawkish .

		Because of his power as much as his fine restraint , Cesare may be said to be an aristocrat among American cartoonists .

		Most interesting of all the cartoons called forth by the war are those of
Louis Raemaekers of Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are certainly an addition to the world 's great cartoons and must long remain a significant commentary on the present struggle .

		Conviction has winged
Raemaekers	ORGANIZATION	's pen with such virile penetration that the
Kaiser	PERSON	has set a price upon his head , and small wonder .

		For it is with the outraged sense of the angels that
Raemaekers	ORGANIZATION	has witnessed the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and the slaughter of the world 's youth .

		Raemaekers is too big a man to hate his enemy , no Prussian tricks for him .

		And he is also too big a man to accept the spineless dictates of neutrality .

		Despite the politics of his country or the welfare of his own purse , he spoke out .

		Because of his conviction there is in his work a spiritual quality that grips and stirs one to white heat .

		These are not merry pictures , but no man or woman should evade the responsibility of studying each one of them .

		They tell us more than can words something of what the men at the front have suffered .

		Those of us who have not done our bit in actual service , owe it to the memory of those who have , to realize as intimately and vividly as is possible what war is .

		Else , how shall we know the magnitude of our debt ?

		Morris based most of his poems upon legends well known in other versions some of the world 's best stories indeed and it is hoped that the book will be read with interest for the stories themselves , and that it may also serve as an introduction to the work of the poet .

		THE PENITENT OF BRENT By
MICHAEL WOOD	PERSON	, Author of `` The House of Peace , '' `` The Double Road , '' etc. .

		Crown Svo .


$ 1.35	MONEY	net .

		This book has a twofold purpose .

		It is an attempt to illustrate the working of the soul , both consciously and subconsciously , in the invisible worlds .

		It is also written as a suggestion of the enormous power of penitence ; viewed less as a condition of the mind and emotions than as a spiritual energy acting upon the world at large , and upon individuals in particular .

		The book has thus some bearing upon the questions of mystical substitution and reparation ; in it a distinction is drawn between repentance and penjtence ; the first being viewed as the natural workings of human conscience ; the second as being , in effect , the Holiness of God working in and through the soul .

		It is not often that a novelist adopts a living fellow - worker as the central figure of his story .

		This is , how - ever , the case with Mr.
Oxenham	PERSON	's new novel .

		While wandering on Dartmoor the author stumbled into a living actual romance , of which Miss
Beatrice Chase	PERSON	, author of several popular books about Dartmoor , was the center .

		This book tells the tale , which is named after Miss Chase .

		MY LADY OF THE MOOR , and it has , of course , been written with her full consent and approval .

		One object of this series , which will be confined to such work as would seem to deserve publicity , is to remove from the work of young poets the reproach of insolvency .

		It is hoped that these Adventures may justly claim the attention of those intellects which , in resisting the enervating influence of the novel , look for something of permanent value in the more arduous pursuit of poetry .

		545 HOLIDAY JUVENILE LIST 549 LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		.

		554 Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, looking through the windows of `` Venetian Life '' upon the life of
Europe	LOCATION	in general , once paused to note the tendency of an advanced civilization to substitute form for spirit , the husk for the substance .

		What he said of life may well be said of one of life 's major privileges , art ; and it may be said with special force of that particular form of art known as the short-story .

		American life , while younger than European , has lost its first freshness ; and
America	LOCATION	's best contri - bution to the general body of art has already become jejune .

		The short-story , as we know it in the magazines , is now an article of delib - erate manufacture , a conscious object of bar - gain and sale as much so as furniture or footwear .

		It is a ready-made mould into which material equally ready-made - may be run .

		Numerous pens are busy telling how to concoct it and how to market it .

		The most high-minded editor is not above asking for `` a bright love-story , not to exceed five thousand words . ''

		A myriad hands cooper - ate in the manufacture of this art-form for almost every organ of print , to appease the terrible leisure of the all-devouring modern eye .

		This briefer form of fiction , in its best estate , may be said to stand like a young tree the stem towers ; the sap runs ; the foliage , if redundant , presents the liberal charms of branch , bud , leaf , light and shade ; one may explore its intricate verdure with due reward .

		But the average short fiction of commerce is now too frequently a hollow , sapless affair , a spectre of incipient decay , if not an actual mass of deadwood , against the bright sky of rightful expectation : both in the lexicograph - ical and the popular use of the word , it is `` punk . ''

		Yes , deadwood is right : the deadwood of conventional description and characteriza - tion ; the deadwood of `` punch '' and `` climax '' laboriously reached by recipe ; a parade of tedious paraphernalia which anybody who reads short-stories at all knows by heart and should be glad to be relieved from .

		How best escape the stale and inflated conventions 516 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	that beset and overload the short-story ?

		How best economize the efforts of the writer and the attention of the reader ?

		How best gain brevity , concision , intensity and height - ened sense of form ?

		One way , at least , seems to present itself : that new method of expression now called whether in derision , or from over-readiness to accept a label , or from supine vagueness in front of a novel actuality free verse .

		What is thus termed , I should incline to call neither verse , on the one hand , nor prose , on the other .

		Between black and white are shades of gray ; between high tones and low , serviceable octaves intervene ; between noon and midnight there is a borderland of dusk or of dawn .

		Free verse balances on the fence between poetry and prose , and dips beak or tail toward either at will .

		The less sym - pathetic mind may prefer to see a bird of clumsier breed : one that , on occasion , rises upon the air , yet drags its feet along the ground .

		The free versifier draws at will upon the stability and earthboundness of prose and upon the aerial strata that lie above .

		He can pedestrianize over the firm road , yet indulge the lift and the lilt when - ever the lift and the lilt seem good .

		Above all , he can readily lay tribute upon some of the best effects and advantages of poetry - the packed thought , the winged epithet , the concentrated expression .

		The `` bright story of five thousand words '' may be told with all superfluities discarded and all redun - dancies stripped away in seven or eight hundred , with greater regard for economy of attention , whether of mind or of eye .

		One would not , perhaps , offer the short story in free verse or , rather , in flexible rhythms and tight-packed verbality to the clientele of Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	or of Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	.

		No ; these faithful fol - lowers , in their snug , distant homes , on long winter evenings , must have their pages by the hundred , by the thousand : why hasten to rise from table when there is nowhere in partic - ular to go ?

		But a lively , over-driven , urban body of readers , limited as to time and har - ried by an appetite for novel notions , should welcome the new vehicle : the sort of reader who nibbles , sips , flirts his napkin , twitches his chair , looks down the board and asks , `` What next ? ''

		He is the devotee or the victim of the quick tempo ; he hears the j end before the end is reached and is already !

		preparing to ask for another tune .

		I am far from saying that such an attitude toward a work of art is admirable ; in fact , the speed-mania , as involved in the appre - hension perhaps I mean , appreciation of any manifestation of art or literature , should be deplored ; but we must take our day as we find it .

		What surprises me is that a busy people , a people often so impatient in one direction , should be so willing to dawdle in another .

		On the other hand , I would not encourage too far the terrible , air-cleaving rapidity of the
Spoon River	LOCATION	tombstones ; indeed , these must generously be half-forgot - ten -LRB- should that be possible -RRB- if the free-verse story of moderate dimensions is to be accorded a fair measure of patience .

		The dance of death which we are all leading may have its lively steps , but need not make itself into a hurricane-jig .

		One 's `` verre '' may indeed be `` petit , '' but shall it not hold more than a single concentrated drop of bitterness ?

		We may quicken our pace , but need we hurl our - selves down the Gadarene slopes ?

		The trebly compressed , quintessentialized pungency of
Spoon River	LOCATION	is an escape of strongest ammonia a triumph for Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, but a despair for anybody who follows him .

		No , gentle reader ; do not expect the whole story in a single page .

		Be willing to turn four or five of them small ones .

		Remember how many of them large ones you have been turning in the magazines : standardized novelle of love , adventure , graft , crime , local - color , `` kid-stuff , '' and the rest .

		The short-story in free verse may appear in various guises .

		It may be biographical , like Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's `` All Life in a Life , '' recently rewarded with a prize by `` Poetry . ''

		It may be episodical , like some of the things of
Robert Frost	ORGANIZATION	bolts of frieze or linsey - woolsey , if you like , but reasonable in length and clean-cut as to selvage .

		It may be semi - lyrical , getting itself done in bursts of color - ful emotion , like some of the pieces of
Amy Lowell	PERSON	.

		It may seize still other opportunities .

		It may become the home of touch-and-go , the haunt of the hint and of the glancing allusion .

		It can give in a single epithet the essence of a prose sentence , and in a single phrase the spirit of a prose paragraph .

		It will let you be humorous , if you can be ; hortatory or pathetic , if you wish to be .

		It will come as a grateful ally to the man who is not a space -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 517 filler at space-filling rates , but who is intent on sincere and pointed self-expression for its own sake .

		It may even exercise the compell - ing continuity that chains children to the comic supplement .

		A favorite objection to free verse or to free rhythm is that it is merely prose cut up , arbitrarily , into short lengths .

		`` What determines the length of your lines ? ''

		the ribald ask .

		`` And what decides for you the size of your stanza or strophe ? ''

		The strophe is shaped by the exercise of an original architectonic consciousness , either active or latent ; and the length of its lines is deter - mined by a variety of considerations .

		First and foremost , the writer must feel as , indeed , always and everywhere his theme .

		He must sense it , if but subconsciously and perhaps best subconsciously as a matter of flow and cadence .

		This flow he need not greatly care to guide ; quite likely it will guide itself .

		Again , he shepes his lines for the advantage -LRB- perfectly legitimate -RRB- of the pause at the end , whether to aid the rhythm or the emphasis .

		If extra emphasis be required , a line may be made to consist of but two or three words , or even of but one .

		He divides also for change and variety .

		He divides also for the ease of the eye , that sadly overworked organ ; and I may say , just here , that the young eye , fresh and untired , is no judge of the importance of this point .

		Such an eye is at once too strong and too inexperienced for a delicate test , and over - looks the advantage of `` filled '' and of `` void '' well-distributed , over the printed page .

		What is done in prose sporadically and casually is done in free rhythm on system .

		If you say that free verse needs all the help it can get to make it easy reading , you are entitled to the jest merry and perhaps obligatory ; but you are likely to come , later on , to a different frame of mind .

		And as concerns the combined length of line and of strophe , let us return to the figure of aqueous flow : see , if you will , a succession of small waves on a ground-swell - but expect neither from the greater nor from the less a mechanical regularity .

		In the matter of metrical detail the thor - ough-going verslibrist looks a bit askant at the employment of iambics , dactyls , and other recognized measures of the older prosody .

		If these are to be used they must be used spar - ingly , in association with the more subtle rhythms and cadences of prose ; and their equivocal presence may be still further cloaked by divisions into line-lengths of much irregularity .

		Nothing is truer than this : that if a new day is going to express itself to advantage , it must make its new moulds as well as find its new material .

		The later vintage , crude and homely though it may be , deserves its own bottles .

		Doubtless many of the early free-versifiers have shown themselves lack - ing .

		They have been vague , inchoate , `` woozy '' ; and they have had nothing very definite to say .

		The vagarious mood has done duty for the clear-cut thought , the sprightly hand-spring for the firm-footed , straight - bearing course .

		Such moods and manners may perhaps be allowed to the poet in free verse , but they assuredly can not be permitted to the story-teller in free verse .

		He must have a ponderable theme , a straightaway con - tinuity of thought , and a sense of form that takes heed of beginning , middle , and end .

		Such a man , thus equipped , ought to be able to compass , first a hearing , then tolerance , then acceptance , then the real welcome that follows on having done the timely thing in the idiom of the new day .

		But the conserva - tive lingers long both for ill and for good , be it said and the acceptance of the novel may not be so rapid and complete as the newer novellista would desire .

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A good example of how the literary spirit persists in
France	LOCATION	notwithstanding the stress of war is shown by the revision and comple - tion of that admirable collection of the French poets of to-day , `` Anthologie des Poetes Franais Contemporains '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Delagrave , 4 volumes , 3 frs .

		50 each -RRB- .

		The first three volumes , which appeared originally about ten years ago , have just been supple - mented by a fourth , and the whole work brought down to
July , 1914	DATE	.

		The period covered extends from
1866	DATE	to the present time , and not less than 300 poets , French for the most part , though
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	are not overlooked , are here rep - resented .

		Selections from the work of each poet are accompanied by a specimen of his handwriting and an original and often very 518 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	good biographical and critical notice .

		The preface to the whole series is from the pen of
Sully Prudhomme	PERSON	and was written the year before he died ,
1907	DATE	.

		It presents in graceful but strong terms the claims of the old school in face of the aggressive and rugged New Verse , while the editor of the collection ,
M. Gerard Walch	PERSON	, who went to much labor in correspondence and research to bring together all these scattered elements , dwells , in his introduction , on `` the immense richness of the poetic production of an epoch which , as regards poetry , surpasses all those which have preceded it . ''


M. Walch	PERSON	is a highly cultivated Dutchman of Huguenot descent , many members of the French branch of whose family have figured or still figure in the liberal walks of life in
France	LOCATION	and two of whom heve recently fallen on the west front `` in the cause of right and justice , '' he writes me ; and his French proclivities are still further increased by the fact that his wife is the granddaughter of an officer of
the Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is a pro- fessor in one of the great commercial schools of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	and an ardent member of the Dutch branch of
the League of Neutral Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		This extract from a recent letter of his to me is interesting in more respects than one : From the way things look now , it seems to me that this war will have a happy effect on French letters .

		The final triumph of the good cause will necessarily bring about an exaltation of the grand moral forces which the struggle has contributed to stimulate so powerfully .

		Then the poets will sing of the deep human sentiments , and sane national traditions will be respected without excluding an enlightened internationalism .

		There will also rise up a profound disgust for a certain kind of molly - coddleness and a contempt for all snobbishness and easy-going success in life .

		The broad spiritualistic and religious current which existed already before the war and which is represented in my supplemental volume by such Catholic poets as
Adrien Mithouard	PERSON	,
Eobert Vallery-Kadot	PERSON	, Le Cardonnel and others , and by free-thinkers like
Paul Hyacinthe Loyson	PERSON	, will be widened and gain in strength .

		We shall also see blossom forth a beautiful pure love-poetry think of the young women who have married blind soldiers !

		a poetry which will be permeated with filial tender - ness and devotion .

		Nor will these poets stop at the celebration of the chaste joys of family and friend - ship .

		New dreams , largely humanitarian , will emanate from the ruins of the past , dreams of human solidarity and fraternity , forever protected from a recurrence of these hideous crimes of militarism now running riot in bloody orgies .

		But who will be the lofty poet who will sing of this the Great War , of this titanic struggle , whose most insignificant episodes throw into the shade the grandest exploits of our ancestors ?

		Who will be this poet , who this genius ?

		The situation calls for another
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		An American will be pleasantly surprised at the frequent mention in this Anthology of
Poe	PERSON	, one of the many instances in modern European literature of the deep impression which this erratic genius has made on the intellectuals of the Old World and which reminds me of another example of this that I have not seen mentioned in the
United States	LOCATION	.


Odilon Redon	PERSON	, the distinguished French engraver who died recently , did not make a portrait of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, as some have imagined , but he did publish in
1882	DATE	a series of six lithographs and a frontispiece in plastic correlation with the literary work of `` this writer of genius , '' as
M. Andre Mellerio	PERSON	, the French art critic , calls him in a note to me .

		`` A
Edgar Poe	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Fischbacker -RRB- , like the other albums of Redon , has long been out of print ; but a reduction in facsimile of this series and of all his engravings for that mat - ter , is to be found in
Mellerio	LOCATION	's `` Odilon Redon '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Societe pour 1 ` Etude de la Gravure Franchise , 144 rue de
Longchamp	LOCATION	, 500 copies privately printed ,
1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		Speak - ing of this book , the author writes me : It was written in close collaboration with
Redon	PERSON	and is confined exclusively to his engravings , which I treat very fully .

		But it contains nothing about his pictorial work , which however was also important , especially in recent years .

		It is a great artist who has disappeared , but at least his art creations will live after him .

		He leaves a widow as intelligent as she is good , and his eldest son has been at the front since the outbreak of the war .

		It is this widow who has called my atten - tion to the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' for
August 16 last	DATE	, where
M. Andre Fontainas	PERSON	, the Belgian poet , publishes `` a long and true study of my husband , '' in which many inter - esting things are said about the Poe influence on Redon the same is seen also in
M. Thiebault-Sisson	PERSON	's chronique in the `` Temps '' of
November 12	DATE	though the fact is over - looked that he exhibited in
America	LOCATION	in
1913	DATE	, at
New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In fact , at the international exhibition of the
Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion of
American Painters	ORGANIZATION	and Sculptors , held in the
spring	DATE	of that year in the first - named city , a special room was devoted to the paintings and engravings of Redon .

		And this leads up naturally to the death , still more recently , of another famous French engraver ,
Alexandre Lunois	PERSON	.

		Indeed ,
Lunois	PERSON	was not only an engraver but , like the old Italian artists , worked in every department of art and worked well .

		Perhaps the best account of his life and labors is to be found in a series of articles published some little time ago by
M. Emile Dacier	PERSON	, in the `` Revue de 1 ` Art Ancien et Moderne '' and brought together later in a thin little volume .

		In
1912	DATE	appeared the more important illustrated work , ``
Alexandre Lunois	PERSON	,
Peintre	LOCATION	, Lithographe et Graveur '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Fleury -RRB- .

		His widow , who
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 519 was the intimate companion of her husband 's home and studio , sends me these interesting details of his art life : My husband never wrote anything about his art , which he loved so dearly and all that remains of his views thereon is what has been preserved by intimate friends from conversations with him .

		One of these friends the writer and art critic ,
M. Raymond E	ORGANIZATION	& eholier , now at the front , has under way a work about my husband which will appear some day .

		Among his productions which have not been exhibited are his last etchings and lithographs , especially one representing a mass in a ruined church , for jny husband , like so many other artists to-day , took subjects from this war , a tragic catastrophe which caused him much moral suffering because of all the mourning he saw around him .

		It surely hastened his end .

		He was not well when he began , and nearly finished before he died , a large canvas , a street scene in
Seville	LOCATION	.

		He always loved Spanish subjects .

		This work he executed with much vigor and joy .

		Another literary-art note is worth record - ing here .

		M. Thiebault-Sisson , whom I have just mentioned , the art critic of the `` Temps . ''

		has been and is still publishing in that journal a series of articles on the more intimate side of
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		He tells me that he intends eventually to bring all these articles together in a volume .

		On this subject , he wrote me last month : Rodin himself is the chief source of my informa - tion , especially as regards the events of his childhood .

		For the rest , I have largely utilized information furnished me during a period of some fifteen years , the past fifteen years , by artists who have been close to
Rodin	PERSON	and have long worked with him , such as Pezieux , now dead ,
Jules Desbois	PERSON	, the sculptor , and a number of others who in some cases were simply friends of the artist , as was
Constantin Meunier	PERSON	, for instance .

		In order to attain greater accuracy , I have often compared the statements of one of these men with the statements of the others .

		This care was all the more necessary because
Rodin	PERSON	is no longer in a mental state to aid in an undertaking of this kind .

		Some four or five months ago his memory began to fail him until to-day he can not recall the cir - cumstances concerning work done only twelve or fifteen years ago .

		His friends fear he may never recover from the stroke which he had last
spring	DATE	; in fact , one of these has said to me that he `` doubts if
Rodin	PERSON	sees the
spring of 1917	DATE	. ''

		which probably puts an end to the plan which was cherished in some quarters of his early visit to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Another death in the French intellectual - artistic world should not pass unnoticed .

		M. Mares , mayor of
Lovagny	LOCATION	, in the
Haute Savoie	LOCATION	.

		has left to the academy of that region 200,000 francs and his chateau of Montrottier .

		surrounded by some 230 acres of land and housing a rich museum , the whole gift being valued at a round million of francs .

		The president of this academy .

		M. Mignet , writes me as follows , and what he savs well illus - I trates what I dwelt upon more at length in one of my DIAL letters of
last winter	DATE	concern - ing the numerosity of the literary academies I scattered all over
France	LOCATION	: The Academic Florimontane , not Florimontaise , as the
Paris	LOCATION	`` Temps '' prints it , was founded at
Annecy	LOCATION	in
1851	DATE	and is the revival of an institution of the same name created in that city in
1606	DATE	, that is , nearly thirty years before the foundation of the French Academy , created by St.
Francis de Sales	PERSON	, who was born near
Annecy	LOCATION	, and by President
Favre	PERSON	, the celebrated jurisconsult of the seventeenth century .

		Its object is to encourage letters , the sciences , and the arts ; to collect manuscripts , charts and documents interesting local history ; to approve all good things and to support every measure which redounds to the glory of our nation .

		It awards prizes in history and poetry and publishes a quarterly , the `` Revue Savoisienne . ''

		M. Mares was a member of our body .

		The collections which he has left us are made up of pictures , statues , engravings , enamels , tapestries , fans , antique furniture , etc. , and some 300 rare ancient and modern volumes .

		A somewhat similar gift , but with a deeper meaning , is that of the Hotel Merghelynck , at shamefully wronged
Ypres	LOCATION	, presented to the martyred Belgian nation in the very midst of her sufferings .

		My friend Fontainas , men - tioned above , has seen the mansion and its contents .

		He sends me this note : It is an elegant , though somewhat ostentatious , residence constructed from
1774	DATE	to
1776	DATE	by a Merghelynek , Seigneur van de Camerl , councilor of the city of
Ypres	LOCATION	, and is given by the great great grandson of the founder of the house ,
M. Arthur Merghelynck	PERSON	, who has furnished it with
Louis	PERSON	XVth and
Louis	PERSON	XVIth furniture and decorated it with engravings of the same epoch .

		In a word , he has there created a museum of the eighteenth century in the finest taste and in fitting surroundings .

		I close this letter with some short literary items which may be of interest .

		Concerning the article , `` Les Petits Garnets de Sainte - Beuve , '' which appeared some little time ago in the `` Revue Hebdomadaire , '' Mme.
Marie Louis Pailleron	PERSON	, the author thereof , writes !

		me : `` These precious note-books , which have been some time in my possession , reveal the fecundity of this mind , its power for work !

		and its ardor .

		One sees , in germ , in the Sainte-Beuve of 18 , all the great qualities of our first of grand critics . ''

		In sending me the French edition of Dr.
John Finley	PERSON	's , .

		`` The French in the Heart of
America	LOCATION	'' `` Les Francais au Coeur de 1 ` Amerique '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Armand Colin	PERSON	, 5 frs . -RRB-

		, translated by Mme.
Boutroux	PERSON	, with a preface by
M. Gabriel Hanotaux	PERSON	,
M. Emile Boutroux	PERSON	writes : `` We are deeply touched here in
France	LOCATION	by the many marks of sympathy which reach us from the citizens of the sister republic .

		It is j very agreeable to us to note that so many of the fellow citizens of Lincoln believe that we ' are fighting to-day as they were in the past that ` government of the .

		people , by the people , 520 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Professor
Paul Founder	PERSON	, of the
Paris Law School	ORGANIZATION	and member of the Insti - tute , sends me in separate form an article of his which has come out in the latest number of the `` Revue Generale de
Droit International Public	ORGANIZATION	, '' which shows that in
1139	DATE	the second Council of the
Lateran	PERSON	`` prohibited among Christians the use in war of arms which were too murderous '' ; and these arms were the bow and cross-bow !

		`` We have made progress , especially on the Teutonic front , since those ancient days . ''

		M. and Mme.
Leblanc	PERSON	, who have formed at their hotel at
6 Avenue de Malakoif	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, a remarkable collection of drawings , engravings , and documents bearing on the present war , write me as follows : `` We are aiming to establish a public museum devoted to the bibliography and iconography of the war so that the French may later live over again the present struggle and never forget it as some have that of
1870	DATE	. ''

		The interesting chronique which appeared in a recent number of the `` Temps , '' `` Les Diners de
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, '' has led some to suppose that we were to have another volume of the great poet 's table-talk .

		But such is not the case .

		M.
Marcel Pillon	PERSON	, the author of the article , is too young to have sat at the table of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	; `` these souvenirs come to me from my grandfather . ''

		Mme.
Marcelle Tinayre	PERSON	has just returned from a five months ' visit at
Salonica	LOCATION	and is now engaged in writ - ing her impressions of her voyage in
Greece	LOCATION	, which will be followed by a story whose plot will be laid in
Salonica	LOCATION	.

		The war and these writings occasioned thereby have suspended the completion of the
Toulon	LOCATION	novel which
Mme. Tinayre	ORGANIZATION	had under way in
1914	DATE	, as ex - plained in a letter of mine to THE DIAL a year or so ago .

		Professor
Giorgio del Vecchio	PERSON	, of the university of
Bologna	LOCATION	, sends me a pam - phlet , which has appeared both in French and Italian : `` Les Raisons Morales de la Guerre Italienne '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Societe d ` Economic Sociale -RRB- , `` Le Ragioni Morali della Nostra Guerra '' -LRB-
Bologna	LOCATION	: Stabilimento Poligrafico j Emiliano -RRB- .

		His desire now is to have it come out in English dress too .

		The spirit which pervades this pamphlet is shown in these lines which I take from the author 's letter to me : `` No war has been felt more profoundly and more intensely wished for , none has been actuated by a more elevated imperative morality ; never was there a more just war , whose aim is not only natural but human redemption .

		Our conscience is clear as our enthusiasm is ardent ; and we have absolute faith in victory . ''

		Much has been said of some of our fine young Americans who have given their lives for the cause of the Allies .

		But one youthful hero has been somewhat overlooked ,
Kenneth Weeks	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, who fought in the same company with
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's son .

		The latter told me that the last time he saw him , on the fatal day , Weeks was `` rushing forward , face to the enemy . ''

		His mother has just brought out a little memorial volume , ``
Kenneth Weeks	PERSON	, a Soldier of the Legion '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
George Allen	PERSON	-RRB- , which con - tains new and touching details not only of her son but also of this terrible struggle still in progress on the western front .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LATEST NOBEL PRIZE WINNER ,
Verner von Heidenstam	PERSON	, is described as being almost everything that his famous fellow-country - man ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	, was not .

		Idealist and ro - manticist to his finger tips , the younger man has for at least thirty of his fifty-seven years waged vigorous warfare on the realism of his celebrated senior in literary art .

		It was in the eighties and nineties that the battle between the realistic and the romantic schools in
Sweden	LOCATION	developed its greatest fury , and the realists were winning when the young painter-poet , fresh from postgraduate travel and study in
Greece	LOCATION	and the Orient , belted on his sword in defence of the things of the imagination , of beauty in literature and art , and `` proclaimed the Renaissance doctrine of the ` joy of life , ' '' as one of his admirers has expressed it .

		Born to wealth , an aristocrat of polished manners and courtly bearing , somewhat of a dilettante , an enthusiastic Hellenist -LRB- perhaps , like Pater before him , of the Cyrenaic school -RRB- , and with a mind enriched and enlarged by extensive travel , this gentleman and scholar had , manifestly , little in common with the wild-eyed , long - haired , and generally unkempt followers of Ibsen and
Strindberg	LOCATION	and their like .

		Poet , novelist , critic , historian , philosopher , and teacher ,
Verner von Heidenstam	PERSON	is best known for his great work ``
Hans Alienus	PERSON	, '' comparable in scope with ``
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' and ``
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	, '' his `` Endymion , '' and his historical study , `` The Carolines , '' on
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		and his period .

		So far as imper - fect acquaintance with the man and his work can enable the distant observer to judge , this latest winner of the Nobel Prize for literature deserves the honor .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 521 Ax OLD STORY REVIVED may enjoy a vogue comparable with its first popularity .

		Such a rehabilitated favorite seems at present to be ' - The Man Without a Country , '' current conditions in the political and military world being obviously of a nature to secure a will - ing ^ - reading -LRB- O r it may be in many instances a first reading -RRB- of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's famous masterpiece .

		Amid the chorus of praise with which the story has been deserv - edly hailed , it is noticeable that at least one dissentient voice has striven to make itself heard .

		As a curiosity in literary criticism , let us quote these words from a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	correspondent to a prominent
New York	LOCATION	journal : `` Permit me to characterize the book as being , as far as a fair knowledge of Eng - lish literature would justify me in saying , probably the most malicious , mean-spirited , fiendish book that the mind of man has con - ceived .

		For unblushing ferocity , for malice and delight in punishment , for bad manners and low general character , I do not know anything to equal it . ''

		Though such a charge hardly needs rebuttal , let us quote a single paragraph near the end of the story , where
Danforth	PERSON	, evidently voicing the author 's sen timents , thus unbosoms himself : ``
Ingham	LOCATION	, I swear to you that I felt like a monster that I had not told him everything before .

		Danger or no danger , delicacy or no delicacy , who was I , that I should have been acting the tyrant all this time over this dear , sainted old man , who had years ago expiated , in his whole manhood 's life , the madness of a boy 's trea - son ?

		` Mr.
Nolan	PERSON	. '

		said I , ' I will tell you everything you ask about .

		Only , where shall I begin ? ''

		: If there is anything `` malicious , mean-spirited , fiendish '' in the supposed treat - ment of
Philip Nolan	PERSON	, it certainly has not the author 's final approval .

		A PITFALL FOR AUTHORS is often hidden in the innocent looking scrap of negotiable paper received in exchange for a literary produc - tion .

		A beginning writer , in the glad triumph of getting twenty-five or fifty dollars for a piece of prose or verse , all out of his own head , is seldom in a mood to scrutinize too closely the fine print on the back of his check , just above the place for his signature .

		He writes his name with a flourish , and away goes the check to his banker .

		Later it may or may not dawn upon him that he has signed away his rights book rights , foreign rights , trans - lation rights , dramatic rights , and film rights all for a pittance in hand , instead of securing for himself and his heirs a possible future revenue of respectable proportions .

		Of course it may be only one instance in a thousand that contains any such delightful possibility ; but why need - lessly throw away even so remote a chance ?

		A writer mentioned by `` The Author '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- was more canny .

		He sent an article to a prominent journal of repute its name is given , but need not here be exposed to further publicity and it was accepted , the note of acceptance specifically referring only to publication in a certain issue , wherein the article duly appeared .

		But the check sent in payment had on its back a clause assigning copyright to the publishers .

		The contribu - tor , having entered into no such agreement , , crossed out this clause before endorsing ; and as a natural consequence the check came back unhonored and marked `` Alteration in receipt requires initial of drawer . ''

		Back to its source , therefore , went the check , with a note to the editor pointing out that there had been no cession of copyright in the correspondence constituting the contract , and asking for a remittance in accordance with the contract .

		In a few days the desired remittance came , with an apologetic note from the business manager , who tried to save his face by add - ing : `` It is always understood that where no special arrangement exists we possess the copyright , but it is not a point which we wish to press in your case . ''

		As a matter of fact , the warrantable assumption , as `` The Author '' maintains , is always the other way about , and even in the absence of a letter of acceptance , publication in a periodical implies an article 's acceptance only for such single publication .

		THE WAY OF THE BOOK-AUCTIONEER IS a shining example in diplomacy .

		In this coun - try there are seven well-known houses that every year do a great business in passing old books under the hammer , and hundreds of other auction houses deal occasionally in the same wares .


New York	LOCATION	, as the centre of our booktrade , has five of these establishments r the
Anderson Galleries	PERSON	, the
Walpole	LOCATION	Galleries , , the
American Art Association	ORGANIZATION	, the house of
Charles Fred Heartman	PERSON	, and that of
Scott & O ` Shaughnessy	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	is known to col - lectors through the name of
C. F. Libbie & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, if for no other reason ; and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	claims the veteran of the book-auction trade in Mr.
Stan V. Henkels	PERSON	.

		Reviewing this list of caterers to collectors , one is naturally moved to query what inducements they each and severally hold out in order to win the patronage both of those who have valuable collections to dispose of and at the same time of those who are looking for bargains in old 522 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	books .

		Of course the seller must be per - suaded by the dealer who approaches him that no other dealer can obtain for him such good prices , and the buyer must be convinced that nowhere else can he get so much for his money .

		With what enticing arts this double end , despite the obvious inconsistency in - volved , is attained , only a
Macchiavelli	ORGANIZATION	or a book-auctioneer could explain .

		THE CULTIVATION OF SUPERFICIALITY has in our modern
America	LOCATION	been carried to an extreme unknown in any other age or nation .

		The newspaper that we glance over every morning encourages superficiality by arrang - ing its matter so that it can be hastily skimmed and then thrown aside .

		But of course the cream , if it be worthy of so flatter - ing a term , is about all one cares to get of the daily news .

		Reputable magazines , how - ever , have adopted the newspaper devices of headlines and synoptical outlines .

		Even the light serial novel now spares the belated reader the trouble of turning back and read - ing from the beginning .

		What has preceded the current instalment is squeezed into a few preliminary lines of fine print , even up to the very closing chapters of the story .

		All this is characteristic of our American prefer - ence for knowingness at the expense of knowl - edge .

		Deep study , prolonged and serious reading , sustained intellectual effort , any con - centration of attention beyond that called for by the illuminated screen of the moving-pic - ture theatre , are generally distasteful .

		We take little pleasure in meditation and rumina - tion ; the only ruminants among us are the gnm-chewers .

		A DESERVEDLY POPULAR BOOK IN EUSSIA bears the title , `` The End of the War . ''

		It is a novel by
Lef Zhdanof	PERSON	, and it has run through several editions .

		If one can not have the end of this atrocious international slaugh - ter in fact , it is something to have it in fancy ; and possibly the imagination of it may help to beget the reality , since all material facts have their origin , as we are asked to believe , in mental images .

		If this be so , what a fear - ful responsibility must be borne by such a writer as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, who long before the year
1914	DATE	prepared the mind of man for the most astonishing and terrifying develop - ments in the art of war .

		But , not to insist on a causative relation that it would be impossible to prove , it is worth noting that the Russians are reported by Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	to have lost interest in the war as a theme for literature .

		War stories and poems and pamphlets and lectures no longer pour from the press , and the mind of the Slav seems to be focussing its attention more upon the future , the time that shall be after the war than upon the dreadful tragedy itself .

		ALLITERATIVE AIDS to effective utterance , both written and spoken , have long been in use , though their occurrence in classical lit - erature is rare .

		Indeed , the very word allit - eration , though Latin in form and etymology , is of post-classical origin .

		Among the users of this device men in public life , especially political life , are conspicuous .

		Political catch - words with the alliterative ring come to mind in some abundance , as `` Fifty-four forty or fight , '' `` Tippecanoe and Tyler too , '' `` Rum ,
Romanism	LOCATION	, and Rebellion '' ; also
Cleveland	LOCATION	's familiar saying , `` It is a condition which con - fronts us , '' and
Burke	PERSON	's `` Men of light and leading , '' `` Not men , but measures , '' `` The dissidence of dissent , and the protestantism of the Protestant religion . ''

		Fondness for allit - eration is clearly seen in our present Presi - dent 's speeches and writings .

		His `` watchful waiting '' has acquired a fame that might have been denied to the same sentiment unalliter - atively worded ; and the same in a lesser degree is true of his `` pitiless publicity . ''

		His very name is alliterative , and a little book of the season containing examples of the `` Wit and Wisdom of
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	'' emphasizes by its title one of the marked characteristics of these pithy utterances .

		Just as rhyme -LRB- which , according to
Milton	LOCATION	, is `` the jingling sound of like endings '' -RRB- facilitates the mem - orizing of verse , so alliteration , or the jingling sound of like beginnings , helps to secure a lasting lodgment in the memory for sayings in prose .

		IN BEHALF OF SANCTITY OF COPYRIGHT , even in time of war and with reference to books published in enemy countries , a letter is addressed by Sir
Frederick Macmillan	PERSON	, head of the publishing house of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	, to the editor of `` The Publishers ' Circular . ''

		Its tone shows that the recent Trading with the Enemy Act , No. 2 , has not the unanimous support of English publishers .

		After explain - ing that this second Enemy Act was passed in order to create a copyright in place of that annulled by the first Enemy Act , the writer continues : `` There is no obligation on the part of the
Public Trustee	ORGANIZATION	to grant licenses for the publication of such works -LSB- works by enemy authors published during the war -RSB- , although he has the power to do so ; and as it seems to me impossible to main -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 523 tain that the publication of such works in
England	LOCATION	is a national necessity affecting either the safety of the
State	ORGANIZATION	or the result of the War , I am of opinion that the government should instruct the
Public Trustee	ORGANIZATION	not to grant any licenses at all .

		The copyrights in Enemy books would thus be secured and held intact until after the war , when they could be restored to their owners .

		This we should do , not for love of the Germans , but for the sake of our own self-respect . ''

		The real mis - chief in the matter was done when the original Trading with the Enemy Act was passed without any adequate understanding of its bearing on the copyright question .

		When this relation revealed itself the second Act was passed in a vain attempt to right a wrong .

		Those competent to pass an opinion seem not to have had much voice in this discreditable piece of legislation .

		ODDITIES OF BOOK-ILLUSTRATION are touched upon in the current issue of `` Branch Library News . ''

		Particular mention is made of the frequent discrepancy between picture and text , especially in novels .

		It must have beoii with this lack of concord in mind that
Mark Twain	PERSON	ventured to address the artist chosen for the illustration of his `` Connecticut Yankee : '' As quoted in the article here referred to .

		the humorist said : `` Mr.
Beard	PERSON	, I do not want to subject you to any unneces - sary suffering , but I do wish you would read the book before making the pictures . ''

		The artist replied that he had read it twice , at which the author expressed surprise , adding : `` I did not think it was the custom with illus - trators , judging from some of the results I have seen . ''

		But there are not a few careful and conscientious illustrators , as those can testify who have been called upon to help them in their search for an authentic por - trait , for instance , or for a picture of a cos - tume of a certain date .

		The writer of this recalls a long hunt in a large library for a satisfactory likeness of the
Duke of Reich	ORGANIZATION	- stadt .

		In the latest annual Report of the
City Library Association	ORGANIZATION	of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the librarian tells of certain illustrations asked for by an illustrator , and adds with truth : `` It often takes longer to hunt up a desired picture than a book . ''

		The pictures desired by this
Springfield	LOCATION	artist were as follows : `` A hair - dresser of about the year 1750 in knee breeches ; the interior of a tailor shop fifty years ago ; a daguerreotype frame ; a revol - ver of the style of
1865	DATE	; a man dressed in the costume of
1850	DATE	with whiskers and long hair ; a thigh bone ; a coiffure of
1750	DATE	; a pig . ''

		It is officially announced that `` Snow on the Distant Mountain '' is the subject which has been chosen for the competitive poems to be judged in the Imperial Court on New Year 's Day ,
1917	DATE	.

		Verses should be sent to the
Bureau of Poetry	ORGANIZATION	of the
Imperial Household Department	ORGANIZATION	, to arrive not later than
December 31 , 1916	DATE	.

		No one may con - tribute more than one poem .

		`` As English is not debarred , there is nothing to prevent some of THE DIAL constituency from entering the competition .

		It is not likely , of course , that an English poem would win a prize ; but it has already happened that such a contribution has been welcomed and has received `` honorable mention . ''

		But an English poem in this contest should not be very long ; it should be less expressive than suggestive or impressionistic .

		The following clipping from the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' is of some general interest :
The Encyclopedia Japonica	ORGANIZATION	undertaken by the Dobunkan has been completed , its last volume having recently been published .

		It is almost fifteen years since the first volume of the encyclopedia was issued , and it is reported that the publisher spent more than
one million yen	MONEY	in preparing the work .

		The encyclopedia consists of twenty-six volumes , and is divided into seven sections ,
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, Educa - tion , Medicine , Law , Philosophy , Industry and Economy , the total number of pages being 24,788 .

		It is the first undertaking of the kind in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Prominent scientists and businessmen of the coun - try have supported the publication , and although it may not be so complete as similar works issued abroad , it is already recognized as a most valuable publication .

		Six hundred and eighty-five scientists and authorities have edited the twenty-six volumes .

		The encyclopedia not only includes facts and explanations of things Japanese , but also serves as a reference work and dictionary of foreign customs and technical expressions .

		In this sense the new Ency - clopedia
Japonica	ORGANIZATION	is a combined encyclopedia and dictionary .

		Each section can be purchased separately , and it is not necessary to buy the whole twenty-six volumes .

		The price of the complete work is
276 yen	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Tokutomi	PERSON	, the able editor of the `` Kokumin Shimbun , '' of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, has published recently an editorial urging that the education of woman is I necessary to national expansion .

		He says that , as woods are necessary in procuring water for a river , so women are essential in solidifying foreign emigration .

		He says that `` our success in
Hawaii	LOCATION	and the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	is evidently due to the family system , for wife and children always make the land homelike wherever men may go . ''

		But he says that `` Japanese women ought to be made international . ''

		`` They should consider the world their home and be prepared to go anywhere in company with their husbands . ''

		And he strongly urges that the education of women should be encouraged , of such a kind as to cultivate the international spirit .

		524 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	A PLEA FOB THE AMATEUE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It has occurred to me that a word should be said for the Amateur ; for may we not over - emphasize the virtue of professionalism ?

		My ideas on the subject are , of course , suggestive for the art of living rather than for editorial proce - dure .

		Recently a woman read to me some original vers lib re and impressionistic essays that gave me a rich afternoon and a lingering aftermood of sparkling , aesthetic ideas , a play of senti - ment and feeling that conferred the sensation that `` life '' -LRB- the elusive , vivid Something most of us pursue but attain not , for it appears to many of us to be stored in books , foreign travel , adventures that overtake remote and magical personalities -RRB- was vibrating here about me and penetrating my soul with its glamor .

		This writer has never tried to obtain publication for her work ; and since it is wifehood and busy motherhood that have developed her natural powers of mellow observation and fancy , sus - tained by an underpinning of quaint authentic humor , she does not seem to aspire to print .

		Her writing is , without effort , just as her breathing is , differing from the latter merely in that it takes place at unexpected moments .

		Its completed effect is as inevitable and natural as daisies in a field , and quite as beautiful and refreshing .

		She is one of those beings rare nowadays : an amateur , true to the essential spirit of the lover of an art .

		My reflections took this shape : I should like to found a periodical for young , unknown , spon - taneous writers , or , rather , not to insist on the quality of youth or obscurity , a vehicle for amateurs .

		The experience recalled to me an occasion of the past , when a friend handed me a tiny sketch written by a Jewess and asked me what hope there was of its being published .

		I replied , `` No hope ! ''

		For I knew the fine writing without substance would kill the bit of sentiment in the eyes of any editor .

		And yet , though that was years ago , in the historic age when `` fine writing '' was univer - sally condemned , I often regret that that page of sentimental prose was not published .

		Print would have given it a point of distinction it could not have in manuscript ; and within the covers of a magazine , related by association in contrast to other productions , its essential quality would have impressed the reader .

		That essay gave me feeling , feeling rounded to mood .

		And though the slight substance was long ago forgotten , that mood , vague as the sensi - bilities awakened on an autumn day , deliciously sad and possessing , like those same sensibilities , with the cool pungency of fog rolling in from the sea late in the afternoon of this same autumn day , remains with me still .

		I did not know the author of that bit of prose , I never saw her or heard her ; but always I see her , luxuriant-haired , sensuous-eyed , brunette of soul and body , wavering magnetically back of the mood .

		She gave me , with her word-evocation that was artless , in our perverted sense of art , that was spontaneous , as all intense feeling is spontaneous , that was unconscious and accidental , a lasting thrill .

		Yes , the tiny drop had the source of a stream ; it has flowed beside me , faintly purling , ever since , and has freshened a narrow territory of its own .

		Having done thus much for me and who would forego that thus much , knowing not its measure - ment , why not for others ?

		Why should so exquisite a presentment of sentiment pass unat - tended ?

		Why should the world waste so pleasur - able an expression ?

		We talk of conservation : why should we not conserve more of our intellectual and emotional products ?

		What a delightful expe - rience it would be for persons to meet for the purpose of exchanging such matured expressions of thought and feeling ; and I am thinking , too , that a magazine devoted to spontaneous outbursts of gifted amateurs would contain much thoroughly fresh and entertaining work .

		There is a perfume of the essential psyche , a naivete , poignant and novel , that most professionals lose sometime before they become professionals .

		When , after reach - ing publication and fame , they attempt to regain this pristine quality of their own beings , which manifests itself in style , they fail .

		The fragrance , , the naivete , they capture is new , somewhat arti - ficial , often mere artifice .

		It is self-conscious , overworked the product of mature cleverness ; while the other , issuing always , be it understood , from a genuinely gifted or highly talented person , is unconscious , partaking of the quality of life itself .

		Against this taste of mine for green flavors may be urged the juvenilia of celebrated authors .

		But here I am strongest in my plea ; for I find in the juvenilia of many writers
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, to go no further that tang of the newly awakened ego attacking the world or enjoying it with a lack of premeditation , self-consciousness , or worldly wisdom , which is the true wisdom that comes out of the mouths of babes .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	they have a saying to the effect that the old should listen to the wisdom of the young ; and talent , or genius , before it has crystallized into technique , has often a crude individual mes - sage , or shout , or murmuring , which it forgets later , but which those who love all the strange accents of the soul , would fain hear .

		We want all that is .

		And we fear to miss the first stammerings , or clamors , or unartful songs of inspired beings in adolescence .

		Some solved riddle may be in them ; some beauty not native to this sublunary sphere ; some reminiscence , or some prophecy we need .

		For while this earth and this earth 's human society is still alien to the soul , that may be the soul 's moment of most pure authenticity .

		While still isolated and unaccustomed , its com - ments might be more truly illuminating concerning earth and its inhabitants , the ego newly born here , than later when that ego has related itself to environment and has grown accustomed to what is , or appears to be , here as we circulate about the sun '

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 525 A DEADER rs * CONSTRUCTIVE AMERICANISM .

		* At a time when the hyphen has received more attention than it merits we may recall to our profit the character and career of a man who , with every temptation to foster dissension in our national life , gave his whole energy to the upbuilding of a sane , unembit - tered , whole-hearted Americanism .

		The man was
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	, whose death a year ago was a loss to our nation as a whole .

		Though the death of this great and good man is so recent , we may speak with confidence of the work he wrought .

		He applied him - self to one of the most baffling and terrible problems that ever confronted a people ; more than any other man he indicated the lines along which the solution of that problem must be found , and more than any other man he contributed to this solution .

		Well might Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	write : `` History is to know two Washingtons , one white , the other black , both Fathers of their people . ''

		Almost simultaneously two volumes have appeared that discuss the labors and the char - acter of this man .

		`` The Life and Times of
Booker	PERSON	T.
Washington	LOCATION	'' is precisely the kind of work that the title suggests .

		Against , the slowly changing background of social , polit - ical , and economic conditions that prevailed in the South during the last sixty years it traces the career of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It borrows interest from the fact that its author , Dr.
B. F. Riley	PERSON	, is a Southern white man of marked ability who has renounced distinction in other fields in order that he maj - give his entire powers to the alleviation of the state of the negroes and to the promotion of better racial relationships .

		The second volume bears also a felicitous title : `` Booker T. Washing - ton : Builder of a Civilization . ''

		Assuming that the reader is acquainted with `` Up from Slavery '' and with the course of Washing - ton 's life , it analyzes and vivifies various aspects of his work .

		Such chapter-headings as `` The Man and his School in the Making , '' `` Leader of his Race , '' ``
Washington	LOCATION	: The Educator . ''

		`` The Rights of the Negro , '' `` Meeting Race Prejudice , '' `` Getting Close to the People , '' `` Managing a Great Institution , '' and ``

Washington	LOCATION	's work .

		This book , like the first , has extrinsic as well as intrinsic interest for us .

		One of the authors was for eighteen years Washing - ton 's secretary ; the other is a grandson of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	.

		By reading both books anyone may obtain a satisfactory understanding of the negro leader .

		The two works supplement each other .

		Both are illustrated , the latter pro- fusely .

		The first is provided with an index ; the second unfortunately is not .

		Each work is good in its kind .

		Errors in details are few ; the only one noticed by the reviewer is Dr.
Riley	PERSON	's statement that the celebration ; of
America	LOCATION	's triumph in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	was held in
1897	DATE	.

		It was really a momentous occurrence in American history when a negro lad in a
West Virginia	LOCATION	salt mine overheard two colored laborers discuss a school through which a black youth could work his way .

		Extinguish - ing the lamp in his cap that he might creep nearer , he learned that the school was called
Hampton	PERSON	and that it was situated in distant
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		He at once conceived the ambition to attend it .

		His prospects of doing so were meagre enough .

		Born in slavery , unable to read or write until he was well in the teens , long kept by his step-father from the wretched school which at last had been open to him , he had obtained the pitiable begin - nings of learning by utilizing such hours as could be spared from days of hard manual toil .

		Until he had entered school he had been known simply as
Booker	LOCATION	, but then in accord - ance with a custom he had assumed a sur - name , choosing that of a great man of whom he had vaguely heard .

		At the same time he had taken another step toward more civilized living : he had previously worn neither hat nor cap , but at this juncture had persuaded his mother to make him a cap from a piece of jeans cloth .

		Now upon hearing of
Hamp	PERSON	- ton he began planning and laboring to enroll there .

		Two years later , after severe difficul - ties , he made his way to the place and passed his entrance examination the sweeping of ; a room with honors .

		After a few years in the institution so capably administered by
General Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	and a few more years in finding himself , he was made principal of a negro school which had theoretically been founded at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	,
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		The rest of ; his story is known , at least roughly , the world over .

Louisiana	LOCATION	white men , came to Tuskegee to assassinate him , but fortunately fell ill and was cured of both his physical and his emotional distemper at the hospital of the institute .

		It is to be noted that these exhibitions of hostility came from those who were actuated by an idea merely , who did not know
Washington	LOCATION	him - self .

		Though sensitive of temperament , he was too wise to regard the restrictions he so often encountered as in any sense personal affronts ; and it is a remarkable fact that he not only had loyal friends among Southern white men , but `` was never insulted by a
Southern	ORGANIZATION	white man . ''

		Grieved as he was by unfairness shown to the negro , he found consolation in the assistance which a negro may readily command .

		The reviewer heard
Washington	LOCATION	only once ; but , as a Southerner , was gladdened at heart at his assurance to a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	audience that where a negro has succeeded the success is due nine times in ten to the friendship , encouragement , and help of a Southern white neighbor .

		The susceptibilities and inclinations of his own race had likewise to be reckoned with .

		After their liberation most negroes thought of slavery as meaning labor and of freedom as meaning immunity from labor .

		Led astray by ill-advised Reconstruction measures , they were in no frame of mind to do the one thing they were capable of doing to toil with their hands .

		Even where they were learning to work , their manner of existence was deplor - able .


Washington	LOCATION	`` found the great majority in the plantation districts living on fat pork and corn bread , and sleeping in one-room cabins .

		They planted nothing but cotton , bought their food at the nearest village or town market instead of raising it , and lived under conditions where the fundamental laws of hygiene and decent social intercourse were both unknown and impossible of application . ''

		Furthermore there were parasites in plenty negroes who were prompt to come `` unin - vited and armed with huge empty baskets '' whenever a picnic was given , and to promise
Washington	LOCATION	a turkey for Thanksgiving and then borrow a dollar from him wherewith to I fatten the fowl .

		To give such a people self - respect , to lay solid foundations for its progress , was a task from which anyone might shrink .

		But as
Washington	LOCATION	himself said in the speech referred to above , he did not mind difficulties ; he thanked God , rather , that he lived in an age and under conditions wherein there were problems to be solved .

		His meas - ures , in the main , were homely enough .

		He preached soap , toothbrushes , and nightgowns , pigs , and paint .

		Of the toothbrush , which he made an entrance requirement at
Tuskegee	ORGANIZATION	, he said : `` There are few single agencies of civilization that are more far-reaching . ''

		He taught his students to raise and prepare their own food , and to make the bricks wherewith the buildings at Tuskegee were constructed .

		He insisted on frugality , on diligence , on keeping out of debt .

		This was partly from prudential reasons , partly as a refutation of the popular belief that negroes , simply because they are negroes , must be slipshod and unsystematic .

		`` He built up an institu - tion almost as large as
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	which runs like clockwork without a single white man or woman having any part in its - actual administration . ''

		By his watchfulness in small matters as well as great he won the confidence of the Southern business man ; likewise he astonished Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	by demonstrating that the building for a library could be erected for
$ 15,000	MONEY	.

		He founded organizations for the promotion of negro welfare .

		He engaged in extension work before anything of the kind was done at
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		He attracted strong support from black people as well as from whites , and by his close touch with negroes everywhere he exerted an incalculable influence upon the rank and file of his race .

		He was interested in concrete and practical matters .

		He saw that the negroes had begun `` at the top instead of at the bottom . ''

		For this reason , and because `` he never forgot that over 80 per cent of his people drew their living directly from the soil , '' he said little of the things he regarded as non-essentials .

		In his wish to emphasize the need for the economic independence of the many , he also said little about the cultural opportunities of the few .

		Because of his silence on these topics he was denounced by radical negroes for cowardice and for truckling to the whites .

		While the charge was absolutely unjust , the thoughts that it suggests ramify into pathos , into tragedy .

		`` I do not think I exaggerate when I say , '' declared
Washington	LOCATION	, `` that perhaps a third or half of the thought and energy of those engaged in the elevation of the colored people is given in the direction of trying to do the thing or not doing the thing
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 527 which , would enhance racial prejudice .

		This feature of the situation I believe very few people at the North or at the South appre - ciate . ''

		Yet he could be outspoken when the occasion demanded .

		He protested that negroes should not be charged for equal accommodations on the railroads and at the same time given inferior accommodations .

		He himself violated Southern laws by riding in Pullmans a measure for the conservation of his sorely tried strength which met with the approval of the whites .

		Except in the South he refused to be bound by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	customs in regard to racial relationships , though he never accepted purely social invita - tions from white people anywhere , and allowed himself only that degree of social intercourse with them which `` seemed best calculated to accomplish his immediate object and his ultimate aims . ''

		He urged that negroes be given a just chance educationally , and dwelt upon the connection between igno - rance and crime .

		He pleaded with legislators against the disfranchisement of negroes as negroes , his position being shown by the words : `` I do not advocate that the Negro make politics or the holding of office an important thing in his life .

		I do urge , in the interest of fair play to everybody , that a Negro who prepares himself in property , in intelligence , and in character to cast a ballot , and desires to do so , should have the opportunity . ''

		Though in general he thought it was wisest to work quietly and indirectly against the murder of negroes by mobs , he proved both his convictions and his courage when he went to
Jacksonville	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	, in the midst of a race war and denounced lynching .

		The success of
Washington	LOCATION	did not come from transcendent intellectual qualities .

		These he did not possess .

		Much of it came from sheer character from the instinct which caused him to be patient under adver - sity , to shun even the appearance of exploit - ing his own name by giving Chautauqua lec - tures for profit to himself , to write innumerable letters after his journeys to `` each and every person who had tried in any way to contribute to the pleasure and success of his trip . ''

		Much of it came from his right - mindedness , from what Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has called `` his constant common sense . ''

		This quality revealed itself in a multitude of ways .

		It was shown by his judgment in not taking too much for granted in his extension work , in insisting `` that the meetings be conducted for the benefit of the ignorant and not in the interests of the learned . ''

		It showed in his anxiety that while the North was being educated to give money , the cultivation of wise relationships with the Southern white people should not be neglected .

		It showed in his use of his influence with Presidents
Roosevelt	PERSON	and
Taft	PERSON	, `` not to increase the num - ber of Negro appointees , but rather to raise the personnel of Negro officeholders . ''

		It showed in `` his unerring instinct for putting first things first , '' and for watching minute details without losing sight of large ends .

		It was supported by a patient , constructive , and optimistic spirit .

		`` Lynchings are widely reported by telegraph , '' he explained ; `` the quiet , effective work of devoted white people in the South for Negro uplift is not gener - ally or widely reported . ''

		He reminded negroes that the handicaps to which they were subjected `` were after all superficial and did not interfere with their chance to work and earn a living . ''

		He pointed out the superiority of the condition of the negro to that of the peasant in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And his con - ception of his own task was that it consisted not `` so much in conducting a school as educating a race . ''

		To the gifts which were his through character and purpose must be added the qualities of the born leader , the natural administrator .

		When he bade , he was obeyed ; when he set an example , others were inspired to emulate it .

		The last years of his life constituted a race against time .

		He had started his people upon the upward course ; he felt that nothing was more vital than that capable leaders should be provided while vast adjustments were still in the making .

		Already Tuskegee had turned out men and women who had proved they might be relied on , had proved they were the hope of their race .

		He was eager that this leadership should be still more rapidly and successfully created .

		Hence at a time when his strength was giving way under the pressure of innumerable duties he applied himself with even more prodigious energy .

		There can be no question that his unselfish exertions hastened his death .

		He left a great work unfinished , but the impulse he gave it was such as neither the black race nor the white will willingly let die .

December 14	DATE	FOUR AMERICAN POETS * Recognition of two principles underlies the present poetic movement : the first , that there exists no poetic subject as such ' no one matter , that is , more susceptible than another of poetic treatment ; the second , that rhythm is organic that the musical form of verse must be intimately moulded by its emotional content .

		On them has been based almost entirely its broader appeal .

		As a result there is observed a certain tendency to misunderstand them and pervert their sig - nificance .

		Because it is admitted that a poet may find ample inspiration in modern life , it is often contended that the theme of vital poetry must necessarily be contemporary ; and because it is evident that every poet worthy of the name invents his own versification , however `` regular '' it may appear when did such a poet ever consciously write `` iambs '' ?

		it is urged that only through deliberate divergence from traditional practice is genu - ine originality possible .

		Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	, at least , is the victim of no such vain illusions .

		In his latest book , `` The Great Valley , '' the author of the `` Spoon River Anthology '' `` the only poet with Americanism in his bones , '' accord - ing to Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	, his `` dis - coverer '' writes of Apollo , the Furies ,
Marsyas	LOCATION	, and
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	, as freely as of the men and women who made
Chicago	LOCATION	, while this leading exponent of a new medium , mid - way between prose and poetry , shows him - self quite impartial in his employment of traditional metres and of those free rhythms more peculiar to himself blank verse , the rhymed pentameter couplet , and vers libre .

		It would be hard to say in which he displays the greater artistic ineptitude ; and if one were casting about for a convenient confuta - tion of Mr.
Max Eastman	PERSON	's theory of `` lazy verse , '' he need look no farther than a book in which the worst of Whitman -LRB- `` Come Republic '' -RRB- is found side by side with the worst of Shakespeare -LRB- `` Man of Our Street '' and `` The Typical American '' -RRB- .

		Not that there do not occur flashes of the power and penetration , coupled with the harsh felicities of word and phrase , that made of the '' Spoon River Anthology , '' with all its obvious cru - dities , a really notable performance .

		are relatively few , and largely lost in the welter of words .

		The truth is , of course , that Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, who seemed at one time to give a certain artistic promise , is not primarily an artist at all , but a moralist and social philosopher of vague ideological tendencies .

		For the moment , in ` the `` Spoon River Anthology , '' his discursive instincts were held in check by the sheer mechanical requirements of the restricted form he imposed upon himself , in the brief space and inscriptional succinctness of the epigram .

		This artificial restraint once removed , however , the poet appears in his proper guise as a popular preacher of semi - literary , pseudo-scientific pretensions , who has read `` Bob '' Ingersoll ,
Darwin	PERSON	,
Gobineau	PERSON	,
Grote	PERSON	, a whole shelf - full of the `` World 's Best Literature , '' and is eager to bring the conglomerate wisdom thus acquired to bear upon the solution of social problems , the mystical interpretation of our national des - tinies .

		In this merely edifying end , all sense of artistic proportion is lost .

		A story like that of `` Cato Braden , '' which would have been compressed into fourteen lines in the `` Spoon River Anthology , '' is here developed interminably through as many pages .

		Even then the poet , fearing lest he may not have exhausted all its implications , returns to the attack in a supplementary poem , `` Will Boy den Lectures , '' a sort of funeral sermon for the country editor , dead at the age of fifty-one , of wasted opportunities and Bright 's Disease .

		The significance of the whole is summed up in the admonition addressed to city-dwellers , at the end of the first poem , to Think sometimes of the American village and What may be done for conservation of The souls of men and women in the village .

		a fairly representative example of his habitual homiletic style .

		The poems in which Mr.
Masters	PERSON	is least unsuccessful are those in which he only too seldom seems stirred by some note of personal feeling , such as ``
Malachy Degan	PERSON	, '' the lightly touched portrait of a prize-fight referee ; and `` Slip Shoe Lovey , '' a genuine enough bit of greasy kitchen genre .

		Those in which , on the other hand , he is seen at his absolute worst , are the
Chicago	LOCATION	series , where the `` bigness '' of his theme , as he conceives - it , betrays him into almost incredible turgidity and bombast .

		`` Bigness '' has an equally bale - ful effect upon Mr.
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	, inciting him , in his `` Chicago Poems , '' to a brutality and violence of expression about which there seems a good deal that is alien and artificial .

		But there are apparently two Mr.
Sandburgs	PERSON	: one the rather gross , simple-minded , sen -
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 529 timental , sensual man among men , going with scarcely qualified gusto through the grimy business of modern life , which , mystical mobocrat , he at once assails and glorifies ; the other , the highly sensitized impressionist who finds in the subtle accords between his own ideal moods and the loveliest , most elusive aspects of the external world , material for delicate and dreamlike expression .

		The first Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	is merely a clever reporter , with a bias for social criticism .

		The second , within his limits , is a true artist , whose method of concentration , of intense , objective realisation , ranges him with those who call themselves `` Imagists . ''

		This method of Imagism , with its insistence upon the clear , concrete , sharply defined rendering of the poet 's idea or `` image , '' whatever this may be ,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	protests against the current notion of the Imagist as exclusively a picture-maker , naturally tends to restrict his range , to throw him back upon the briefer lyric or dramatic forms for expres - sion .

		There are Imagists , however , who refuse to accept as inevitable the narrow limitations seemingly imposed by their artistic ideal .

		They are ambitious to achieve longer , more considerable czuvres than the epigram .

		Doubt - less one of these days we shall have an Imagist epic , and perhaps Miss
Lowell	PERSON	will be the author of it .

		At present , however , she is content to appear in the more modest role of story-teller .

		Not that the tales contained in her latest collection , `` Men , Women and Ghosts , '' are by any means her first , whether in the more usual verse forms to which she , no less than Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, turns from time to time ; or in her more characteristic vers Itbre ; or in her still more personally flavored `` polyphonic prose . ''

		Those who have read her earlier vol - ume , `` Sword Blades and Poppy Seed , '' will recall , particularly , two pieces in the last - mentioned manner , `` In a Castle , '' and `` The Basket , '' as among the best things it con - tained .

		Indeed it is doubtful if the new book , with the possible exception of `` Pat - terns '' a perfect thing in its way has any - thing to show quite so successful .

		One can not help feeling , as one reads , that
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, exhilarated by former successes , has come to write too much and too rapidly .

		Often her instinct for what is really signifi - cant fails her in those poems in which , as she says , `` the dramatis personae are air , clouds , trees , houses , streets , and such like things '' ; her impressionism or rather `` expressivism '' degenerates into a mere passion for the picturesque ; and she seems content to achieve upon occasion a scattering effect with a charge of buckshot , where we should have expected a succession of bull 's - eyes .

		And if this is true even of so richly and warmly colored a composition as `` Mal - maison '' which suffers also from a certain sluggishness of movement in spite of its brisk phrases it is felt very much more in many of the other poems particularly in those where Miss
Lowell	PERSON	employs that `` unrelated '' method , or method of the `` catalogue , '' which , however fascinating for the artist , constitutes a very distinct menace for her art .

		Nor do we always feel the same variety and elasticity in her rhythms as before , owing no doubt to the constantly increasing strain put upon them .

		Formerly Miss
Lowell	PERSON	was satis - fied to make them merely the appropriate musical embodiment of her thought and feel - ing organic , in short .

		Now she seeks often to render them directly imitative of the `` pro- nounced movements of natural objects , '' such as the hoops and shuttlecocks of the little girls in `` A
Roxbury	LOCATION	Garden , '' or of the `` flow - ing , changing rhythm '' of musical instru - ments in `` The
Cremona	LOCATION	Violin , '' and `` Stravinsky 's Three Pieces ` Grotesques , ' for String Quartette . ''

		Each reader must decide independently as to the success of these novel and daring experiments .

		But in the opinion of the present reviewer , at least ,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	has very largely sacrificed that beauty which comes from the handling of the line of verse as an instrument in itself , in order to achieve what is at best but a faint , far-off suggestion of the alien effect aimed at .

		The same straining effort after imitation as an end , not as a means merely , leads
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	to invent words , or rather vocables , to represent sounds in nature directly , instead of simply suggesting them imaginatively .

		This is always a questionable device , to be used sparingly .

		With
Miss Lowell	PERSON	it has become a habit , almost a vice , threatening to spread like a blight over all her work .

		Scarcely a poem of any length in the present collection but presents one or more example , like the Whee-e-e !

		Bump !

		Bump !

		Tong-ti-bump !

		with which she attempts to rival the dis - sonances of modern music .

		Such a practice , carried to such bizarre excess , simply bears witness to the poverty of the poet 's verbal resources .

		In general it may be said of
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	that her feeling for the color values of words is much superior to her sense of their sonorous quality .

		And yet without the latter language being what it is , a purely musical medium there can be no real distinction of style in poetry .

		Very 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	few American poets to-day show such dis - tinction .

		Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	has a touch of it in more than one poem in his latest collec - tion , `` Mountain Interval , '' in `` The Oven Bird , '' for example : There is a singer everyone has heard Loud , a midsummer and a midwood bird , Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again .

		It is for this purely sensuous quality , as well as for his genuine passion for nature , expressed through such wealth and delicacy of observed detail , that one most legit - imately reads and admires Mr.
Frost	PERSON	.

		There are , too , elements of deep divination in his art , where it touches complex human relations and reactions .

		But as a dramatic and nar - rative poet , his method is often unnecessarily cryptic and involved .

		Thus in `` Snow '' there is nothing sufficiently remarkable either in the incident itself , or in the resultant revela - tion and clash of character , to justify its long and elaborate treatment .

		But in `` In the Home Stretch '' the poet is singularly successful in suggesting ghostly presences , in creating a veritable haunted atmosphere for the old
New England	LOCATION	farmhouse , akin to that produced by the English poet , Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , in `` The Listeners . ''

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	is the one continuator at present of the `` tradi - tion of magic '' in American poetry .

		ENGLISH INFLUENCE ON OUR INSTITUTIONS * Some such volume as this has long been needed by the students of American history .

		Not , indeed , that Mr.
Cunningham	PERSON	has done more than indicate the way in which their demands may one day receive satisfaction .

		His book is rather a series of important and , often , brilliant hints than in any sense a full and formal treatise .

		He is occupied rather with the analysis of institutions than with the tracing of ideas ; of the influence , for example , of English political ideas upon the nature of American democracy he has nothing whatever to say .

		But Mr.

		He makes us realize the entire lack of relation between the * ENGLISH INFLUENCE ON THE UNITED STATES .

		isolation of geography , on the one hand , and the isolation of ideas on the other .

		His book may well prove the stimulus to that fertiliz - ing novelty of outlook to which , for example , the ingenious scholarship of Professor
F. J. Turner	PERSON	has long made us accustomed .

		The same merits which have made Mr.
Cunning	PERSON	- ham 's `` Growth of English Industry '' a classical work , its breadth , its solidity , the ability to weave the most diverse authority into something like an integrated and artistic whole , are here present in a full degree .

		His book gives us a realization of the complex strands which have gone to the making of our national institutions .

		His book will help to dissipate a legend of separatism which has been with us too long .

		And in so far as it aids in that dissipation , it will be a welcome contribution to international understanding .

		But Mr.
Cunningham	PERSON	's book suggests cer - tain reflections on the character of American historical work which it is perhaps worth while to adumbrate .

		This is the age of the documented monograph .

		No statesman , no area , no event seems too small to be studied .

		No one can grumble at the loving care which edits the writings of the Fathers in a hundred massive volumes .

		If Hay and
Nicolay	PERSON	choose to bury Lincoln behind the great tangled mass they elected to call a biography , we may at any rate feel the comfort that from this material the characterization we so urgently need may one day be evolved .

		But the prob - lem grows more serious when that case becomes extended to purely local problems when men choose , for example , to write on the grand scale the history of a single city during the Eevolution , or to detail in a heavy octavo the social gossip of a middle-western town a hundred years ago .

		One begins more and more to entertain the disquieting sus - picion that the heaven-sent historian who is one day to do for
America	LOCATION	what men like
Stubbs	PERSON	and
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Maitland	PERSON	have done in their respective spheres for
England	LOCATION	, will be overburdened by his material and give up that work in disgust .

		Yet nothing is more urgently needed than the synoptic view from which a philosophic interpretation can alone be derived .

		There seems a real danger lest our specialists may make us lose all sense of perspective .

		Men seem less willing to attempt the historic feats of
Hildreth	PERSON	or
McMaster	PERSON	.

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	's fine fragment remains as yet a fragment .

		The book we so urgently need from Professor
Turner	PERSON	seems almost beyond our hopes .

		Meanwhile the material accumulates endlessly , until we are likely to be buried beneath it .

		The modern student seems more anxious to produce what is new
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 531 mainly in the sense of what is unpublished than to attempt the interpretation of those problems about which we have now sufficient material to form an adequate judgment .

		Men like Professor
Andrews	PERSON	, who will make the half of American history their own , grow more and more rare ; or , if they are with us , they do not write .

		The materials have become so vast that there are few who have the cour - age to undertake the examination of a great period rather than the elucidation of some tiny topic within that period .

		It is scholar - ship , but it is not history .

		A book like Mr.
Cunningham	PERSON	's calls us back to a truer perspective .

		If the young scholar wishes to be the chief living author - ity on the tactics of Bunker Hill , or of sectionalism in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, we shall not grudge him the privilege ; but we shall ask of him something more .

		Those of us who , while bound to remain outsiders in the study of American history , are yet deeply interested in its study , are a little tired of the choice that is now offered us .

		We have a plethora of handbooks , none of which attains , to take a single example , to the superlative vigor of
J. R. Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		If we would avoid that tedium , there is little save the monograph that is fully abreast of modern research .

		It is true enough that the age of the grand amateurs is passed .

		We shall see no more Motleys or Prescotts or Parkmans .

		History has become scientific ; and the student must be trained to the use of his tools .

		But because we are scientific we need not cease to be human .

		We must remember that if history is a science , it is also , and not less truly an epic .

		It must not cease to tell events so that , even when a century and a half has passed , we can catch the subdued murmur of Lincoln 's voice at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	just as , after the lapse of two thousand years , the very inflection of Pericles 's moving tones comes to us in the hard passion of Thucydides .

		Let us train our scholars to the tasks of scholarship .

		But let us ceaselessly emphasize the function of scholarship in the service of humanity .

		POETRY FROM THE TRENCHES *
Robert W. Service	ORGANIZATION	has been a poetic phe - nomenon .

		More or less ignored by the critics , he has won a vast following .

		And it seems to me time for a fellow-craftsman to protest that in this case the public is right .

		During these years while `` The Spell of the Yukon '' has RHYMES OF A RED CROSS MAN .

		accumulated a staggering sale of five hundred thousand copies and while the wells of Kipling have been growing muddy or dry , the professors of poetry and the dilettanti have been paying attention to Imagists and Spectrists , leaving Service they thought ' to school-boys .

		But the popularity of this poet need not have hurt him in the eyes of the discerning nor need his debt to Kipling have injured him in their ears .

		It happens that I had just read and reviewed `` Spectra , '' the latest expression of `` the new verse , '' and been struck with it as a strange phosphorescent crest of impression - ism , when there came into my hands the vol - ume by
Service	ORGANIZATION	, `` Rhymes of a Red Cross Man , '' two hundred pages of sturdy sen - timental realism .

		And I started up with a gasp .

		Here was `` the old verse . ''

		Here was something actual , intimate , human , alive .

		I will grant at the outset , to such as incline j to disagree with my estimate , an occasional familiar crudeness in the book and the mawk - ishness of poems like `` Our Hero , '' `` Son , '' and `` The Convalescent . ''

		But the crudeness is the kind you grasp hands with heartily and the mawkishness is the kind you look away from respectfully , and what 's left , by far the greater part , you thrill and laugh over like a boy .

		Here , as in the earlier poems , is an implicit acknowledgment of the debt to Kipling .

		It reaches even to free use of the phrase , `` thin red line of ` eroes '' or to the refrain , `` For !

		I 'm goin ' ` ome to Blighty in the mawnin ' ' echoing the refrain of ``
Danny Deever	PERSON	. ''

		But such echoes are the proper salute of kinship ; for this latest book confirms Service not as
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's imitator only but as his successor .

		`` The Ballads of a Cheechako '' and `` Rhymes of a Rolling Stone '' were a disappointment to those who suspected their author of a true and important gift ; for they contained noth - ing of the calibre of `` The Spell of the Yukon , '' that big poem which distinguished his first volume , `` Songs of a Sourdough , '' and has become the title-poem of its later editions .

		Nor did the general contents of his two inter - mediate volumes bear out the general promise of the first or prepare one for the vigor and sweep and human emotion of these poems of the War .

		The poems are dedicated to Ser - vice 's brother , `` killed in action ,
August 1916	DATE	, '' but the emotion in them is not melan - choly or bitter .

		It is not against ; it is for .

		And it is not for a kingdom on earth or in heaven , but for your home and your fellows : and there 's a recurrent feeling that your fel - lows may , after all , be Germans .

		532 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	The best of the poems are long narratives in dialect , Cockney or Scottish .

		There are `` The Odyssey of ` Erbert ` Iggins , '' `` The Whistle of
Sandy McGraw	PERSON	, '' `` Bill the Bom - ber , '' `` The
Haggis	PERSON	of Private
McPhee	PERSON	, '' `` The Coward , '' `` Only a Boche , '' `` My Bay ` nit , '' and `` My Mate . ''

		Fragments are unsatis - factory , but one stanza from `` The Red Ketreat '' shows how the Tommies set out and hints at days and nights that followed .

		`` A-singin ' '' Go 's Yer Lady Friend ? '

		we started out from ` Arver , A-singin ' till our froats was dry we did n't care a ` ang ; The Frenchies ` ow they lined the way , and slung us their palaver , And all we knowed to arnser was the one word ` vang ' ; They gave us booze and caporal , and cheered for us like crazy , And all the pretty gels was out to kiss us as we And ` ow they all went dotty when we ` owled the Marcelaisey !

		Oh , Gawd !

		Them was the happy days , the days too good to last . ''

		Perhaps in `` The Song of the Pacifist '' Ser - vice is expressing his own judgment that the establishment of `` justice and truth and love '' and of Eight against Might , can only be a lesser victory , in fact will be `` a vast defeat , '' unless our children 's children `` in the name of the Dead '' conquer War itself .

		But the book is not in its best element a commentary or a conclusion , it is an emotion ; and therein , in emotion and in action , lies its strength .

		It is what Kipling might have made of the War , had his genius still been young .

		FEEDING THE BELGIANS * In `` War Bread '' Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	tells the story of the succor of a nation .

		He served as an American delegate of the
Commission for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in
Belgium	LOCATION	, but there is nothing in his book of the aridity of a statistical or official document .

		Instead , Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	has given us a singularly fresh and personal view , a series of impressions , always sincere and moderate , often of admirable vividness .

		If he was tempted to sentimentalize over
Belgium	LOCATION	, he resisted the temptation , and his narrative is pointed only with the sharpness of the observed fact .

		He was singularly fortunate in the begin - nings of his adventure .

		He set out for
Europe	LOCATION	on a neutral liner , crowded with German reservists going home to the war .

		It was a complete initiation into a point of view .

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	later visited
Berlin	LOCATION	and talked with leaders and recruits , with radicals and scholars ; there is nothing to indicate that he learned anything new about the Teutonic temper or philosophy .

		On the decks of the `` Nieuw Amsterdam '' he had absorbed the whole of that German philosophy of might which has regimented a people sentiment borrowing the cool language of science , the national will to power investing itself with the sanctions of an alliance with Destiny .

		All these German reservists exhibited that insensitiveness to the fate of the individual which grows inevitably out of the Teutonic habit of `` thinking in centuries '' and merging the identity of the citizens in the abstract identity of the State ; they were the creatures of a new categorical imperative , foredoomed to the hardness that has always marked off a `` chosen people . ''

		In so far as a nation yields to this mystical fatalism , it is already suffi - ciently dehumanized for aggressive war .

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	's fellow-travellers set out in a lyric mood , flushed with confidence .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 533 herself , to discipline
Europe	LOCATION	and the world .

		The Iron Year had come , and the
Fatherland	LOCATION	was prepared to assert the validity of a natural law discovered , opportunely enough , by German pundits .

		Having studied the philosophy on the `` Nieuw Amsterdam '' and in
Berlin	LOCATION	, Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	contrived to escape through the German lines into
Belgium	LOCATION	, where he saw the religion of expansion express itself in terms of the actual .

		At
Antwerp	LOCATION	he lay for thrilling hours in a coal hole under the foundations of a house at number 74 rue du Peage , and heard the mes - sengers of German kultur burst over-head .

		They were truly expansive , those shells .

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	is very human about them .

		Faced with the realities of war , he was incapable of the solemnity of the moralist ; an experience so new and so tremendous must be tasted for itself before one can hope to evaluate it .

		`` My senses were keenly alive to danger , but there was a strange joy in the thought that life was to be obliterated in a mad chaos of flame and steel and thunder .

		Death seemed suddenly the great adventure ; the supreme experience .

		And there was something splen - did , like music , in the incessant insane snarl of the shells and the blasts of the explosions . ''

		From
Antwerp	LOCATION	, after the fall , he joined the panic-stricken flight to the Dutch border .

		It was such a sight as one does not often see , the exodus of a people uprooted and swept blindly forward on the winds of war , unthink - ing , conscious only of a great fear : Most of that sad army went dinnerless and supper - less , and most of it still marched .

		Its own inertia , not its will , seemed to carry it on , and a strange sound came from it as it moved a continuous dron - ing , a low murmur , like heavy breathing , which filled all the night air .

		That sound seemed to come from the earth and the sky and the trees and the grass , as well as from the marching men .

		It was a sound more terrible than human wailing .

		It was as if all nature mourned , and as if this vast movement through the night were tile funeral procession of a nation ... In such moments the philosophy of the poor alone stands , for it is a philosophy founded on the harsh and wounding facts .

		That strange optimism which desires only to live , and which is hardly to be distinguished from the blackest pessimism , emerges as the basic philosophy of the miraculous survival of man - kind in a hostile world .

		It was imparted to the author by an old peasant whom he met on the road to
Belgium	LOCATION	: The war !

		Ah , monsieur , it is a curse .

		But then , much in life is a curse , and we must bear it tranquilly .

		To live , that is the important thing .

		Men fight each other , cheat each other , steal each other 's land , lust for one another 's wives yes , monsieur , it is true but we must live .

		We must bear all tranquilly .

		It is war .

		It is life , n'est - ce pas ?

		After the destruction , the reconstruction partial at least .

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	was among the first of the Americans to take service under
Herbert L. Hoover	PERSON	.

		He was assigned to relief work in
Antwerp	LOCATION	, where he remained the virtual economic administrator for a year ; and the closing chapters of his narrative deal with the complicated and delicate administra - tive and diplomatic details incident to feeding and clothing two millions and a half of people .

		The task was not simply one of organization , of transportation and distribu - tion , difficult as such a task would have been .

		A campaign of publicity had to be under - taken in the chief neutral powers , as well as in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		An irresistible sentiment had to be created that would make it possible to treat the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's work in
Belgium	LOCATION	as second in importance only to the interests of the belligerent nations , and the jealousy and suspicion of those nations had to be allayed if the work of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	was to be carried on without interference and disastrous bickerings .

		The man who achieved the miracles of organization and diplomacy in
Belgium	LOCATION	was
Herbert L. Hoover	PERSON	, an American mining engineer resident in
London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	wrote `` War Bread '' partly to answer the question .

		Who is Hoover ?

		and he has succeeded very well in dramatizing an amezing talent .

		Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	, too , believes in efficiency , but his efficiency is not precisely the German ideal : it is an efficiency watchful to utilize instead of to pare away the idiosyncrasies of the human material with which it must work .

		Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	speaks of his chief as `` a construc - tive artist in human destiny , '' and as such he has , of course , a certain ruthlessness of his own .

		`` He uses men , throws them aside and forgets them , as every world architect must , for he has , along with his amazing diplomatic skill , as frank a way in dealing with men as with conditions . ''

		Like all men of action , he puts his trust in the fait accompli , and after reading of his astounding address , you are quite convinced that , in exceptional circum - stances , it is the only doctrine .

		Those who read `` War Bread '' will long remember , I think , this quiet and masterful man with a talent for big affairs .

		He is very nearly the best type that our industrial civilization has hitherto produced ; he expresses us infinitely better , for example , than our writers and our artists .

		Our eloquence still lies in appropri - ate action .

		534 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	THE THIRST FOR SALVATION * This latest novel of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	differs in some respects from Ms recent work , while in general the methods which he employs in tell - ing the story are characteristic .

		His choice of a subject , in the first place , takes him back to the scene of his youth and earlier manhood in
Ohio	LOCATION	, which is rarely treated in his other novels , except when , as in the case of `` The Kentons , '' he made this life a point of departure for an international contrast .

		The story deals with primitive emotions in a primitive state of society .

		It is based , as the author tells us , on the narrative of Judge
Taneyhill	PERSON	, from which the details concerning the religious impostor who was the hero of the story are taken .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has , however , taken only the bare details ; he has touched these details with imagination ; and the psy - chological development of the religious enthu - siasm of the community , which is the main motive of the story , is apparently his own .


Joseph Dylks	PERSON	came to the little settlement of
Leatherwood Creek	ORGANIZATION	, in
Ohio	LOCATION	, at a time when the religious interest of the community was keen .

		This interest was sharpened by secta - rian differences among the Evangelical sects ; but practical expedience made it necessary to have one temple of worship , which the differ - ent sects evidently used in turn .

		This condi - tion of affairs made the settlement a very - fitting field for a religious impostor of the type that Dylks represented .

		He began by announcing himself as a prophet ; then he mounted by degrees from the role of inter - preter to that of a deity , and finally an - nounced himself boldly as a god of equal power with any god known to his hearers .

		He is pictured as a man of striking personal - ity , good looking in a coarse way , but with very little balance of mind or fixity of pur - pose .

		In the sequel he is shown to have had even no physical courage .

		The human relations of the impostor are drawn with real skill .

		Some time before the story opens he had married and deserted his wife ,
Nancy	PERSON	, and she , believing him dead , had married again .

		The character of the people in that time and locality is indicated very well by the severe standard of judgment by which her brother ,
David Gillespie	PERSON	, made clear to her that she must no longer live with her second husband ,
Laban	PERSON	, even for a day , when she knows that Dylks is alive .

		The parting of the husband and wife is a bit of tragedy simply told .

		Dylks at first makes no effort * THE LEATHERWOOD GOD .

		to interfere with his wife , but later on he endeavors to persuade her to live with him , and she , having grown to loathe him , refuses .

		Neither she nor her brother makes any effort to expose him , fearing the personal hold which he has upon her , and
David Gillespie	PERSON	even watches in silence the hypnotic effect that Dylks is having upon
Jane Gillespie	PERSON	, his daughter .

		Nancy 's oldest child ,
Joey	PERSON	-LRB-
Dylks	ORGANIZATION	's son -RRB- , is allowed by his mother to attend the revival meetings of Dylks , owing to some very natural sub-conscious feeling on her part that his father has some rights in him which even his long neglect has not entirely destroyed .

		The inevitable happens .

		Dylks is forced into a position where he must produce a miracle of a concrete character ; he is unable to do so .

		He is driven from his temple and from the neighborhood by the forces of unbelief and common sense and ends his days a pitiable figure , after he has led his so-called `` little flock '' to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Howells makes the forces of common sense and of irreligion concrete , but in different bodies .

		In Squire
Matthew Braile	PERSON	, he has drawn a very interesting character who typifies the unenthusiastic attitude toward the religious enthusiasm of the neighborhood .


Matthew Braile	PERSON	delights in nothing so much as to lead the followers of Dylks to self-con - tradiction and self-exposure .

		Yet , when
Dylks	PERSON	has been seized by the young men of the town who are the concrete representatives of irreligion in an active sense and who drag Dylks before the Squire for trial , Braile decides that he must be allowed to go free , since he has violated no statute of
the State of Ohio	ORGANIZATION	.

		Later on when the fugitive comes back in despair and distress , Braile even hides him from his pursuers .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has evidently been rather afraid that the psychology of his central char - acter would remain hidden from the reader , since in the last chapter , which takes the place of a postscript , he invents a stranger for the purpose of receiving
Matthew Braile	PERSON	's analysis of the character of Dylks and of the situation of which he was the central figure .

		According to him , Dylks might have succeeded if he had had more courage , since he was appealing to a very primitive instinct and was himself more than half deceived as to his mission .

		The fact that a large number of persons believed in him affected him in such a way that he began to doubt whether after all he might not have a divine mission and whether , if he merely announced a miracle as likely to happen , it might not really occur .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 535 Braihrs summing up of the emotional sit - uation which made the impostor possible is interesting : `` You see , '' he resumed after a moment , `` life is hard in a new country , and anybody that promises salvation on easy terms has got a strong hold at the very start .

		People will accept anything from him .

		Somewhere , tucked away in us , is the longing to know whether we 'll live again , and the hope that we 'll live happy .

		I 've got fun out of that fact in a community where I 've had the reputation of an infidel for fifty years ; but all along I 've felt it in myself .

		We want to be good , and we want to be safe , even if we are not good ; and the first fellow that comes along and tells us to have faith in him , and he 'll make it all right , why we have faith in him that 's all . ''

		The book is not written in the style of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's great period , that is , during the time when he produced `` A Modern Instance , '' ``
Silas Lapham	PERSON	, '' `` Indian Summer , '' and `` A Hazard of New Fortunes . ''

		There is no deeply significant character in the book , none that can rank with
Silas Lapham	PERSON	,
Bartley Hubbard	PERSON	, or
Lina Bowen	PERSON	.

		But it is a dis - tinctly better story than `` Miss Bellard 's Inspiration , '' or `` Through the Eye of the Needle , '' or `` The Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' or in fact any of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's later stories with the possible exception of `` The Son of Eoyal Langbrith '' and `` The Landlord at Lion 's Head . ''

		There is a unity of plot , a coherence of motive , and a pictorial quality in the char - acter drawing that make a real contribution to our novels of American life .

$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		of Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		Miss Sidgwick is preeminently what is called `` a novelist of marked distinction '' ; she has to a very high degree her own view of life and her own way of expressing this view , and both are excel - lent .

		`` Hatchways '' is not one of her best novels .

		It is presumably impossible for a novelist to be invariably at her best , or his .

		Many people can not read ``
Daniel Deronda	PERSON	. ''

		for instance , or `` The Adventures of Philip . ''

		Perhaps it was inevitable that the readers of `` A Lady of Leisure , '' `` Duke Jones , '' and `` Accolade '' should be disappointed in what came next .

		In any case the present grievous state of things in
England	LOCATION	would have made impossible for an Englishwoman that sort of imaginative contemplation which , it may be supposed , is necessary to
Miss Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	's best work .

		However it be , `` Hatchways , '' though it is obviously by no one but
Miss Sidgwick	LOCATION	, lacks the structural power that assembles representative ideas and the imme - diate imagination that makes them intelligible .

		Miss
Sidgwick	PERSON	's method and her people are always subtle ; here they are too subtle .

		In Miss
Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	's other books one is sometimes puzzled to know exactly what the author or her people are talking about , but there has generally heretofore been a confident feeling , bred of experience , that they were talking of something worth while .

		In `` Hatchways '' one is not so sure .

		The people are held in a less definite grasp and the plan in which they have their parts seems less definitely con - ceived .

		A world governed by customs and tradi - tions that are never mentioned , influenced by feelings and emotions that are rarely ex - pressed , that is the world as Miss Sidgwick conceives it , perhaps because the English world of leisured culture is the only one she knows , perhaps because she feels that all the world over people are pretty much alike .

		The Ashwins and the Ingestres are excellent types of the two kinds of people that are pre - eminent in such a world ; the latter can comprehend in a measure but are usually too self-absorbed to care to do so , the former not only can comprehend but like to do so and even feel that they must do something more .

		The Duchess , and all the Oxbroughs ,
Adelaide	LOCATION	Courtier , and
Sam Coverack	PERSON	, are of the regular go-ahead type of English , often fairly clever , the kind probably that is to-day fighting the war .


Ernestine Redgate	PERSON	and Sir
George Trenchard	PERSON	are of the finer rarer kind that , one may hope , is directing the fighting .


M. Gabriel du Frettay	PERSON	, the young French - man , understood them better than the others .

		536 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	which explains something of the logic of the Entente .

		`` Hatchways , '' though it does not give us so clear a notion of its author 's world and her view of it as Miss Sidgwick 's other books , gives it to us in much their manner .

		People and things are presented much as they are without much direct narration , that is and we are left to gather what we can .

		That is , of course , in the main , the method of life itself ; we see people and hear them talk , but it is rarely that anybody tells us a finished story of his life and adventures .

		Miss Sidg - wick is selective ; she tells only those things that hang together ; but she explains little , and , as a rule , is content to jot down things that are said and done and leave the rest to us .

		When one remembers that she is deal - ing with people who by habit and tradition do not express their emotional life openly , and who , when they do express themselves , have not the gift of eloquence that belongs to some other races , one can understand why Miss Sidgwick may be called subtle .

		But subtle or not she is always worth reading , and here , though there are no figures like
Violet Ashwin	ORGANIZATION	and
John Ingestre	PERSON	, there is yet much to inter - est and charm .

		A very different sort of rendering of life , and yet almost as near the real thing , is Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's '' The Vermilion Box . ''

		Now that our post boxes are painted green , it may not occur to us that a vermilion box is a post box , but in
England	LOCATION	presumably such is the case .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's book is a loosely connected series of letters .

		Letters make an apparently realistic rendering of life ; but actually they are not so real after all , for , though each letter may be an absolute rendering of reality , nobody but some unfortunate censor ever reads a col - lection of letters written by people of the same general group .

		Miss
Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	's mode of realization has a bit more to say for itself .

		We really do get a knowledge of people and their lives by seeing them do this and that , and by hearing them talk , even though their sayings and doings may appear irrelevant at the time ; whereas one reads letters written to others only on rare occasions .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's book contains , however , a very entertaining set of letters to and from all sorts of people in
England	LOCATION	and is probably as characteristically English as Miss Sidg - wick 's , and that in rather a broader if not deeper way .

		Those who write the letters are mostly of one family , but that is a matter of no especial importance , for they are a very representative set .

		They are practically all of one social class , the upper middle , I sup - pose , not the same as Miss Sidgwick 's upper sphere but equally representative of
England	LOCATION	.

		They present all sorts of views of the war , or rather they all present the same view , but the different writers have varying feelings and very different ways of taking the view that they do take .

		There is Lieutenant - Colonel Sir
Vincent Starr	PERSON	, the soldier on duty ; Mr.
Richard Haven	PERSON	, a bachelor over military age , reflective and humorous , but trying to find some way in which he can make his abilities useful ;
George Wiston	PERSON	, a retired brewer , `` far from sanguine '' -LRB- to use a mild expression -RRB- as to what is going on , sure that everything is being done wrong and that the country is being betrayed and going to the devil , and constantly writing to the papers ;
Lady Starr	PERSON	, a regular soldier 's wife and mother ; Mrs.
Clayton-Mills	PERSON	, so absorbed in her son that she can not bear to have him do anything ; old Mrs. Haven , serious but resigned to the strange changes of the times and particularly to the change in the German character since the days of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then there are a lot of young ones ,
Toby Starr	PERSON	, who immediately hustles into khaki , to camp , and to the front , carrying on a courtship by correspondence and finally get - ting a
Victoria Cross	ORGANIZATION	;
Richard Bernal	PERSON	, who gets married just before going to the front ; and a number of other young people either joining the army or finding some sort of work in nursing .

		It is a most amusing book , full of observation and humor , and it supplies as well a light commentary on the course of English life during the war .

		Miss
Sheila Kaye-Smith	PERSON	's `` Sussex Gorse '' is a different piece of work from either of the others .

		It is one of those long epic or biographic chronicles which deal with a decade as easily as an average book will deal with an hour ; the action runs on for seventy years or so , during the lifetime of one indom - itable man .

		Such a book can hardly tell its story with any such unhurrying subtlety as that of Miss Sidgwick or such unconnected self-expression as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's .

		We must have things told us , and in such books as this , and there have been many of late , we get a sort of narration which is likely to become dry and lifeless .

		It does not often in Miss Kaye-Smith 's book ; her people are generally alive to her imagination ; if she has occasion for a scene , it lives in her mind and she can tell it with realizing detail .

		But in the main such a book must be a chronicle of what has happened .

		What happened in this case is rather an extraordinary thing .

		A farmer 's lad , in
1835	DATE	or so , conceived the desire to become possessed of Boarzell Moor , on the outskirts of which
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 537 he had been born .

		The book tells how he becomes possessed of it .

		It takes him a long time , some seventy years , and costs him a great deal , everything he has in life , down , not to the uttermost farthing -LRB- for it really pays for itself -RRB- , but to the uttermost bit of love , affection , and sympathy .

		He marries but it is with the desire for children to carry on the farm ; his wife dies after having brought him half a dozen boys and a couple of girls .

		He looks on his children as helpers to his ambition , but they do not share his passionate desire for Boarzell ; one after another , they rebel and break away to find success or failure , usually the latter .

		He him - self becomes so absorbed in his own desire that he can not understand any other , and so misses or throws away the love of the only person who seems really to have understood him .

		It is a grim sort of story , not by any means without power , nor without touches of tenderness by the way , but of rather an incomprehensible subject .

		This overmaster - ing passion for the land , that is something hard for us Americans to sympathize with ; and this particular overmastering passion for a bit of wild land that no one had desired for centuries , seemed as hard for the people in the book to understand as it is for us .

		Mr.
Talbot Mundy	PERSON	's `` King of the Khyber Rifles '' is something very different from these three others , severally and generally .

		Those who read a good deal of fiction know the value of variety as well as do those who deal in physical diet .

		This is `` a rattling story of adventure '' in
India	LOCATION	, in the
Northwest of India	ORGANIZATION	at the present day .

		Those learned in literary history might perhaps dismiss it superciliously as a combination of `` Kim '' and `` She , '' and others less particular might wish that Mr.
Mundy	PERSON	would rid himself of some mannerisms and touches that seem to show the hand of the journey - man rather than of the master .

		But the question of literary originality is not an easy one ; one can dis - cover `` sources '' for `` The Prisoner of Zenda '' or `` The Memoirs of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, '' and yet certainly there was a great originality in each book .

		But aside from such speculations , taken simply for what it is , Mr.
Mundy	PERSON	's book is an excellent story .

		It is a study of a man in the Indian army who , on the outbreak of the war , instead of being wild to get to
Europe	LOCATION	to join in the general fight , desires to devote himself to the task of keeping
India	LOCATION	loyal to
England	LOCATION	until such time as the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	grows beyond the need for leading strings .

		Athel - stan
King	PERSON	is of the fifth generation of Eng - lishmen in the Indian army and his feeling for
India	LOCATION	is too strong even for the blandish - ments of an almost mythical Yasmini .

		Yas - mini herself , though rather over-weighted by the tremendous reputation given her , does excellently when she gets a chance , and at the end carries through what must be a sur - prise except for the most acute of novel - readers .

		All but the ultra-refined will follow with interest the tortuous journey of King in his effort to checkmate German influence and plots in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and will receive satisfaction from the suggestion that there may be more to say later of King and his redoubtable antagonist .

		There alone are the old families with traditions and dependents , the sharply drawn dis - tinctions of class , the general atmosphere of long - established custom , which are so foreign to our kaleidoscopic national unrest .

$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , we find a dramatic story well told , and told with an aston - ishing degree of respect for the intelligence and common sense of the reader .


Kate Leigh	PERSON	had been wooed , won , and brought over the mountains by the last of the Kildares , whose
Kentucky	LOCATION	estate was the rallying-ground of all the sporting blood of the county .

		He ruled his people , as he ruled his dogs , with an undisputed grip .

		The full - blooded girl fell into the new life with the exul - tance of youth set free , until the children came , that is , and until
Jacques Benoix	PERSON	, with his sym - pathy , his manliness , and with a charm which her husband lacked , gradually and unconsciously sup - planted him in her affections .

		This is the back - ground of the story .

		The tale itself concerns the fortunes of
Kate Kildare	PERSON	, of
Jacques	LOCATION	, of his son
Philip	LOCATION	, and of the two highly strung daughters of `` the Madam , '' as the county knew her .

		The novel is swiftly moving , `` strong , '' and if not very elevated , at least extremely good reading .

		`` Sure , 't is talk keeps the world going , ''
Padna Dan	PERSON	and Micus Pat were wont to agree over their pipes and their warm punch .

		` There are a lot of fools in the world , I 'm thinking / said the stranger .

		` There are , thank God , ' replied Micus . ''

		This is the spirit in which he greets life ; its idiosyncrasies , its absurdities , its tragedies , are all grist for his wit , his charm , or his irony .

		As may be imagined , what 538 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	England calls `` the Irish question '' and also what
Boston	LOCATION	calls `` the Irish question , '' come in for their share .

		The author treats them all with humor , beneath which lies oftentimes a keen dart , or perhaps a deeper protest .

		One of the best of his comments upon the question of Irish freedom he puts , quite fittingly , into the mouth of the Devil : ``
Ireland	LOCATION	has always been a great brother to myself and

		Mr.
Jack Lait	PERSON	, who is advertised as writing `` a fresh , snappy , human story each day '' for a
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper , and `` a human Arabian Nights tale each month '' for a well-known magazine , has modeled his style , his subject matter , and his technique so closely on 0 .

		Henry that the comparison is inevitable .

		Mr.
Lait	PERSON	has the whole bag of tricks , and it is only fair to say that he uses them with all the ease , confidence , and success of the master .

		He can produce a rabbit from the interior of a top-hat or a gold watch from the ear of a reader in the same surprising and delightful fashion as his great exemplar .

		And he tells a story almost as well .

		Certain qualities , the personality of genius , which 0 .

		Henry had , the tenderness of insight , the sym - pathy of complete understanding , can not be imitated ; they are copyrighted by
God Almighty	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the accurate observation , the profound knowl - edge of life , particularly of life in the big city , the ability to make his characters vital in a few words , and to crack off his story like a snap of the whip , all these he has in large measure .

		Every story or sketch in this volume , with the exception of `` One Touch of Art , '' is an amazingly clever and successful performance .

		Perhaps as Mr.
Lait	PERSON	acquires more renown , he may abandon the imitative style he now employs and create a new epic of
American Nights	ORGANIZATION	entertainment .

		Whatever he does will be interesting .

		In spite of his horrible diurnal fecundity one may look with anticipation for a new book from his pen .

		When a good humorist turns to tragedy , there are few more effective than he .

		The result is always a little surprising illogically enough ; for the manufacture of humor is a far more serious business than the creation of pathos .

		It is not strange that
Irvin S. Cobb	PERSON	, who writes with a true gift for humor , should prove equally effec - tive when he becomes serious , as he does occasion - ally in his collection of stories called `` Local Color . ''

		-LRB-
Doran	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	. -RRB-

		His title-story describes the adventure of a struggling author who courts local color as a prisoner in Sing-Sing .

		It tells of his gradual descent to the level of his associates , until , his term completed , he is ready to commit his experiences to paper , and discovers himself not only in the position , but actually in the state of mind of the released , sullen convict .

		The story is very moving , very convincing .

		But Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	can not long remain tragic .

		In `` First Corinthians '' he recites the humorous history of the East-Side Finkelsteins , whom charity adopts with bewilder - ing results .

		`` Smooth Crossing '' is a very neatly constructed tale of criminal and detective .

		And perhaps the most typical of the lot is a newspaper story , `` Enter the Villain , '' which Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	asserts to be absolutely moral-less .

		Moral or no moral , it is excellent .

		The author 's pictures of American local color suggest a great deal that is not directly painted in .

		They are something more than enter - taining .

		An unambitious dabbler in the modern black arts takes upon himself the cure of the alcoholically inclined scion of the house of

Penn Yan	ORGANIZATION	, N. Y .

		The Wells estate is a Southern planta - tion transplanted to the shores of
Keuka Lake	LOCATION	, and the family has the full measure of
Virginia	LOCATION	indifference to mere financial routine .

		So it is fortunate that
Richard Richard	PERSON	proves to be fabulously wealthy .

		The plot does not cut very deeply into the structure of life , perhaps ; but the dialogue is quite delightful .

		There are moments when is suggests
Locke	PERSON	, and others when it outdoes Mr.

		There are bits of acute analysis throughout .


Katherine Metcalf Roof	PERSON	has written in `` The Stranger at the Hearth '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , one of the analytical , intellectual novels we expect from certain American woman writers .

		The story presents two antitheses that between the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon America	LOCATION	of our fathers and the present melting-pot , and that between the Anglo-Saxon and Latin understanding of love .

		The social contrast forms a continuous background to the plot .

		The author is not of those who look with hope to the future of
America	LOCATION	.

		One wonders what she would say to
Mary Antin	PERSON	, or
Mary Antin	PERSON	to her !

		She sees in the break-up of the old tradition the cataclysmic descent of the hordes of barbarism .

		From a hundred unexpected points of view she presents the picture of the alien over - running
New York	LOCATION	, as seen through the eyes of an exquisite American woman married to an Italian .

		She finds society vulgarized by the children of immigrants , shops and streetcars filled with jos - tling masses of inarticulate peasants , the English tongue a rarity , courtesy the last heritage of the waning aristocracy .

		The tragedy of the plot lies in the innate lack of sympathy between the Amer - ican
Nina Varesca	PERSON	and her count .

		Upon her return to her own country , she draws comparisons between his alternating inconstancy and demon - strativeness , and the companionable love exem - plified in one of her compatriots .

		Her husband is not capable of trusting her , and she is unable to take him seriously until the final misapprehen - sion has driven him to suicide .

		-LRB- This relief from economic tension gives a heroine an unfair advantage . -RRB-

		She marries a genius of difficult and egotistical temperament , who loves her for her beauty and hates the shackles of domesticity to which she clings .

		Chil - dren are an annoyance to him ; to her , the central motive .

		The alienation of the lovers is told sym - pathetically , and distinctly from the woman 's point of view .

		The author , with much simplicity , assumes certain feminine truisms which are out - side the psychology of a man even of the genius of
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		The story is rounded out by a catastrophe , epic and moving , rather than by a solution .


Stefan Byrd	PERSON	dies a man , giving his life to
France	LOCATION	in the great war , and leaves Mary to fulfil her destiny without him .

		There could be no other happy ending to this conflict of tempera - ments . ''

		I do not believe it is moral to regulate life by considering the desire to remain undisturbed of those that are decayed and petrified . ''

		So we should all agree , probably , differing only in our definitions of petrifaction .

		But
June Ferriss	PERSON	, the advanced heroine of
Ethelyn Leslie Huston	PERSON	's novel , `` The Towers of Ilium '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , adopted the extract in its entirety , refusing to renew her illegal marriage with the father of her child for the immoral reason -LRB- so the world regarded it -RRB- that she did not love him .

		June possessed the forcefulness , the sincerity , the strength , of her exemplar
Ellen Key	PERSON	; she also possessed something of the obscurity , and her author much of the verbosity , of the writer of `` Love and Marriage . ''

		It is a clever turn of plot that provides exactly the situation whereby Mrs.
Huston	PERSON	can prove her case .

		She does not outrage the feelings of the conventional by conscious immorality on the part of her heroine ; but , hav - ing pushed the girl into the required situation , she lets her act and speak in accordance with her perfectly justifiable standards of conduct .

		It is all very neat and very interesting ; but we wish that she had not resorted to a trick .

		We wish , too , that her tale had been shorter .

		The best of it shows the development of the child
June	DATE	, her dawning maturity , her premature gruelling by the forces of the city , leading to her fight for the unfortunate , and to the ideals which were to govern her own precarious existence .

		June 's subsequent career , save in the light of a trial of strength , is not very absorbing .

		But
June	DATE	herself is absorb - ing , and th people who surround her are equally real .

		The argument which lies behind their several characters , desires , and existences is also a very real , if debatable , one to present-day readers .

George S. Hellman	PERSON	, and eked out by an extended Introduction and a number of other
Brevoort	LOCATION	papers , fill two attrac - tive volumes uniform with the letters of Irving to
Brevoort	PERSON	published last year .


Henry Brevoort	PERSON	was a member of a distinguished
New York	LOCATION	family , a prominent and public-spirited citizen , and according to all the information we possess , a cultured and likable man ; but most persons will read these letters because of their recipient , rather than because of their author .

		Those here given , which are from the family papers in possession of
Brevoort	LOCATION	's grandson , Mr.
Grenville Kane	PERSON	, bear dates from
1811	DATE	to
1843	DATE	, and are written from various places
New York	LOCATION	,
Mackinac	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		They deal pleasantly with neighborhood , family , and personal matters , but they show noth - ing that is new regarding
Irving	PERSON	's character , and reveal no important biographical facts .

		The sup - plementary material includes four letters from
Irving	LOCATION	to
Brevoort	LOCATION	not contained in the earlier volumes .

		To all appearances these letters are better edited than were those of Irving to
Brevoort	LOCATION	, though the means of testing accuracy are not so readily available .

		At all events , the introduc - tions and occasional notes explain some of the more obscure references to persons and places .

		Mencken -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , is exactly the sort of thing it purports to be , and exactly the sort of thing that readers of `` The Smart Set '' have long been familiar with .

		It is enough , perhaps , to say that Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	is well practised in its manufacture , and that these newly published burlesques are fairly representative of his degree of proficiency .

		Burlesque is not a thing to chuckle over ; it is not straight humor , laying bare the incongruity of things .

		Nor does it invite thought like satire .

		Satire , when it is good , strips the covering from something inherently absurd or pernicious .

		Not so burlesque , which takes any and every subject for its travesty , making fun of anything within its range of vision by means of exaggeration and incongruity of phrasing , `` so to speak , '' as Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	would add .

		The con - versation of pallbearers at a funeral , a concert programme , a church before a wedding ,
Cheops	LOCATION	building his pyramid , two Americans viewing an Alpine sunset , these are a few of his subjects .

		They are perfectly legitimate subjects for travesty provided you want to take the trouble .

		But they are so ordinary that you have to take a great deal of trouble , and employ quantities of hyperbole , to save your travesty from being equally ordinary .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	occasionally over-reaches himself , exaggerating to the very brink of mean - inglessness so to speak .

		His burlesques are veritable caricatures of satire .

		The length and The present reviewer -LRB- like many breadth of another delver in this ` field , doubt - English drama . -RSB-

		oc!D ^ ^ Qa ^ Q ^ f y , Q ^ ^ Qr & pact and properly edited collection of English plays so often brought home to him by the impor - tunities of would-be readers that he was prepared to welcome any attempt to fill the gap .

		But to tell the truth , the feat performed by Professors
Tatlock	PERSON	and
Martin	PERSON	in their single volume entitled `` Representative English Plays '' -LRB- Century ,
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- fairly took his breath away .

		The boldness of the plan is apparent from the table of contents , on which twenty-five titles stand for the whole length and breadth of English drama Shake - speare alone excepted from `` Noah 's Flood '' to a society comedy that still holds the boards .

		In order to bring the collection within these narrow confines , the editors state in the preface that it was impossible to include `` all celebrated or influ - ential plays or plays of all types . ''

		Thus in the eighteenth century , for example , no specimen is given of either the ballad opera or the bourgeois tragedy .

		Many Elizabethan and Restoration plays of world fame had to be omitted as well as plays of transitional decades especially interesting to the student since they represent the decline of one tradition and the rise of another .

		It is less sur - prising that little space should be allotted to the minor creative periods .

		But in the case at least of the interval of over sixty years between `` The School for Scandal '' and `` The Lady of
Lyons	PERSON	, '' there is a break in the continuity which can hardly be said to be bridged by the one intervening play ,
Shelley	PERSON	's `` Cenci , '' which belongs to the closest rather than the legitimate drama .

		It is true that during the Napoleonic upheaval , the
London	LOCATION	pub - lic seems to have supported dramatic entertain - ments of as low an order of merit as , according to Mr.
Archer	PERSON	, it is doing in the present world catastrophe .

		But from the welter of early nine - teenth century farces , extravaganzas , and spec - tacles , one or two pieces might well have been singled out , if only to illustrate the trend of the times .

		Within limits , however , the editors of this volume of plays have chosen with much wisdom .

		In only two or three instances out of the twenty - five is there likely to be general objection .

		One is the selection of `` Edward the Second '' to rep - resent
Marlowe	PERSON	, whereby the reader is deprived of what should be his inalienable right the `` mighty line '' of `` Tamburlaine '' or `` Faustus . ''

		The other is the choice of
Dryden	PERSON	's `` Conquest of
Granada	LOCATION	'' instead of `` All for Love , '' even though , as the editors contend , there is good reason to desire the reader to be bored with the former instead of being thrilled by the latter .

		It is ques - tion of the historical versus the literary attitude .

		The introductions and notes supply with rigid economy of space the information necessary for understanding each play and for setting it in its
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 541 true perspective .

		Along with a summary of the accepted critical estimates , there are many fresh impressions , and there is throughout a praise - worthy absence of the stereotyped phrase .

		In some instances it is regrettable that clarity is sacrificed to informality , and the looseness of cer - tain of the statements may be challenged .

		Just what , for example , does this assertion mean with reference to `` The Way of the World '' : `` All that saves the plot from being farce is that there are no farcial situations '' ?

		Or this comment upon the `` cynical impudence '' of `` The School for Scandal '' : u lt is acceptable because the play is a work of art , not a study of human character '' ?

		The bibliog - raphy is on a sensible scale and it is well adapted to the general purposes of the book .

		One omis - sion , that of Dr.
Bernbaum	PERSON	's `` The Drama of Sensibility , '' may be noted in an otherwise satis - factory and suggestive list .

		Catholicism `` The Problem of Human Peace , '' , - l l f \ / m TT 1 VJ
Malcolm Quin	PERSON	-LRB- T. Fisher
Unwin	PERSON	-RRB- , is not likely to exercise much influence in securing peace .

		To begin with , admitting that Christianity has for nineteen hun - dred years failed to contribute measurably toward producing peace , he holds that only through `` Scientific Catholicism '' can peace ever come .

		By Catholicism he means the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	with all its institutions , including the papacy ; .

		by scientific Catholicism he means evolutionary reli - gion and faith recognizing the discoveries of science and reason , in short , Catholicism as the Modernist would have it .

		That solid advantage would come to the cause of peace through forward - looking and greater acceptance of scientific knowl - edge is beyond doubt .

		That this must of necessity be linked with the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	is wholly arbitrary , and is likewise a peculiarly em - barrassing condition , seeing that Pope
Leo X.	PERSON	condemned the Modernist view of Catholicism which is here advanced as a power for peace .

		Before peace comes by this route the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	itself will have to be convinced of the Catholicism Mr.
Quin	PERSON	is advocating .

		The tragic death of
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, who was crushed while trying to board a train at
Rouen	LOCATION	on
November 27	DATE	, is a loss not to
Belgium	LOCATION	alone but to the world .

		For
Yerhaeren	PERSON	, while in a peculiar sense the spokesman of his people , had found , for our confused and aspiring civilization , a voice that carried far beyond the borders of his own land .

		Influenced in his youth by Hugo and the Roman - ties , he early found his true way , and his first published work exhibited a robust and joyous naturalism .

		He was preeminently a singer of the modern world , poet of democracy and industrial - ism , who dreamed of a time when local jealousies might be swept aside and when the energy that he delighted to celebrate might , express itself in an international movement for a more habitable world .

		It is a part of the pathos of his death that it should have come at a time when events had shown how illusory , or at least how premature , were his most passionate dreams .

		From the day when , as a boy of eight , he succeeded , to his great joy , in spiling a souvenir book of `` The Black Crook '' at a profit of

		ART AND ARCHITECTURE .

		Never has there been a better time than now for the publication in English of books about
Russia	LOCATION	.

		England 's Muscovite ally is an object of cordial interest to all Englishmen and also to many Americans .

		Accordingly Miss
Rosa Newmarch	PERSON	has done well to defer until now the issue of her long meditated book on `` The Russian Arts . ''

		For nearly twenty years the work has been taking shape in her mind , and though she had wished to make it far more comprehensive than has been found practicable , she has certainly brought together , in what she now offers concerning Rus - sian architecture , painting , and sculpture , much that is new to most readers as well as important in any survey of so considerable a field .

		The usual illustrative accompaniment to such a work is not wanting .

		The delicate repro - ductions , on full-page plates , are fairly bewilder - ing in number .

Miss Emily Burbank	LOCATION	in their attractive work on `` The Art of Interior Decoration . ''

		Its fundamental principles , they tell us in the preface , are three , each expressed in a single word : har - mony , simplicity , spaces .

		In the concluding chan - ter , however , these principles are restated as four in number : good lines , correct proportions , har - monious color scheme , appropriateness .

		Besides explicit directions for the furnishing of rooms , there are chapters on the successive periods in : furniture styles , and some attention is paid to the collecting of antiques .

		While a long purse is needed if one is to make the best practical use of the book , a person of moderate means will find useful suggestions in its pages .

		Formality rather than the careless lux - uriance and irregularity of nature characterize most of these illustrative examples .

		Garden walks , seats , pools , steps , entrances , fountains , sundials , pergolas , arches , and tea houses , with necessary attention to the floral features of the garden , have supplied topics for a treatise of respectable proportions .

		To the lover of the austere in art , of strict observance of form , of an instinctive avoidance of extremes , the luxurious volume offered by Mr.
James H. Worthington	PERSON	and Mr.
Robert P. Baker	PERSON	, under the unpunctuated title , `` Sketches in Poetry Prose Paint and Pencil , '' will not appeal .

		The poetry ranges from free verse to verse less free , but not strictly fettered by the rules of rhyme and rhythm ; and it is all , with the very rare use of a dash , unpunctuated .

		The same breathless incoherence marks the prose , which contents itself with the comma and the period , and perhaps a dash once in a dozen pages , as indications of breaks in the continuity of the thought .

		Here is a brief section one can not call it a sentence of the prose : `` But to attain love is to reach with finite hands and grasp the infinite it can not be possessed , yet he who accepts less of life , is guilty of base prostitution , for love is a direction not a goal , it is as the north and not the pole . ''

		-LRB- The last two clauses seem to have strayed in from the poetry division . -RRB-

Worthington	PERSON	's compositions .

		MISCELLANEOUS .

		A very riot of the imagination , riotously expressed in picture and text , is offered in `` The Clan of Munes , '' by Mr.
Frederick J. Waugh	PERSON	,
N.A.	LOCATION	.

		A clever little wizard from the North created this numerous clan out of gnarled and twisted spruce trees .

		In the words of the book , he `` cunningly joined together these fragments of spruce-trees until he had made him several little wooden images .

		Two of them he recognized at once as looking very much like
Adam	PERSON	and Eve , while the rest were just munes .

		But it did not matter much which was Adam and which was Eve '' nor does any - thing very much matter in so arbitrarily whim - sical , confusingly chaotic a construction as this freak of the artist-author 's imagination .

		But his wizard from the North has as much right to create a race of living beings out of spruce knots as
Cadmus	ORGANIZATION	had to make men of dragon 's teeth , or Deucalion and Pyrrha to turn stones into men and women .

		The ample form of the book admits of astonishing extravagances in illustration , some rioting in color , others more subdued , but all extraordinary , to say the least .

		FIXDING THE BEST ix THE BOOK HARVEST .

		The obligations imposed on the book reviewer at this season of the year are mani - fold .

		He must , in a way , satisfy the interests of many people .

		But we narrow our duties down to two insistent channels , whenever we are confronted by a hundred or more gaily caparisoned volumes clamoring to be read .

		We know that in a cursory article such as this is destined to be , we must , within the limited limits of space , give a fair representa - tion of the juvenile literary crop for Christ - mas , and pay due regard to `` standards . ''

		Without `` standards '' in the choice of books for girls and boys , you might just as well order your story over the telephone , giving , as a gauge to the clerk , the height of your child and the color of his hair .

		After reaching a fairly numbed state , with `` juvenile readers cramp , '' so to speak , we always pause amidst the deluge , and pick out those persistent products of the Juvenile Book Harvest that still make us conscious of their existence .

		Do not , however , infer from this that `` we are '' the tired book reviewer .

		We look forward to our obligations of each season with zest ; literary fads in the child realm are curious phenomena , with curious reasons , educational wise and otherwise for their being .

		Because we have determined certain `` standards '' of reading for children , we are against the myriad editions of re-told legends and fairy tales ; we anathematize the `` series '' as a useless dead-weight of reproduction .

		But we do not overlook any book because of these prejudices .

		Fortunately , each year brings to light a few books of the exceptional order the kind we should add to our `` standard '' list .

		Mind you , we can narrow down a `` standard '' list until it becomes a `` classic '' one .

		But the lists 546 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	which libraries and schools are compiling grow in length and importance from season to season .

		Classics are a luxury , determined by accumulating years of acceptance .

		But we are always at liberty to say tha , t `` stan - dard '' lists need revision .

		Take the conventional attitude of educators toward the subject of the
Bible	LOCATION	as reading for children .

		Year in and year out we have been given diluted , one-syllabled per-versions of the Old and New Testaments .

		There have been offered us biblical narratives , in lan - guage far more difficult to understand than the
King James	LOCATION	version , all exemplifying by their presence and acceptance that some - where in the `` whole '' Bible was a stumbling - block over which the child world could not be made to creep .

		A step in the right direction was taken when Mrs.
Joseph Gilder	PERSON	, with the coopera - tion of Bishop
Potter	PERSON	, issued the `` Bible for Young Folks '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , consisting of suitable passages selected from the Holy Writ .

		Then Mrs.

		, in which
Frances Jenkins Olcott	PERSON	attests her skill and judgment by culling texts from the

		The introduction and appendixes are excellent guides , and altogether I con - sider this volume to be one of the most thoughtful contributions to the juvenile appreciation of the larger Book we have had in a long while .

		It is illustrated by
Willy Pogany	PERSON	.

		Compared with
Nora Archibald Smith	PERSON	's `` Old , Old Tales from the Old , Old Book '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Miss Olcott	PERSON	's book is an example of the new method .

		Yet
Miss Smith	PERSON	, in her re-telling of the
Bible	LOCATION	, has done her work feelingly and with proper spirit .

		My contention is that , as early as possible , children should be cultivated in the realiza - tion of style ; this realization should go hand in hand with the natural desire for the story .

		In the
Bible	LOCATION	, the two are inseparable .

		That is why I prefer
Miss Olcott	PERSON	's direct method .

		The prospective book-buyer is oftentimes ignorant of the fact that lists of children 's books are procurable every year at the libraries .

		One can ask to see
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	's `` Children 's Catalog of One Thousand Books '' -LRB-
Wilson	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		and therein find grouped most of the `` standard '' books of years gone by .

		Under Poetry , for instance , there are listed treasuries of verse , gathered by such excellent hands as
W. E. Henley	PERSON	,

Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	.

		Examine these , and when the bookseller shows you
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's `` The Cambridge Book of Poetry for Children '' -LRB- Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , you will be able better to judge his excellent inclusions and strange omissions .

		But anthologists of any feeling whatsoever are usually on the safe side , though in their choice some may have reasons while others merely have rhyme .

		I think there are fuller collections than this one , yet I recommend it because I think that , in following the taste of the author of `` The Golden Age , '' one can not go far wrong .

		Nor can editors of fairy tale collections stray too greatly from rich fields .

		I remem - ber one year a sumptuous volume , `` Favorite Fairy Tales '' -LRB-

Hadley	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	had loved `` Jack the Giant Killer '' when he was a boy , that

		And in the way of embellishment ,
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	has never been more del - icate or more imaginative .

		Every year we have to revise our concep - tion of what are the best editions of `` stand - ard '' books to buy for young people .

		Of course , the best are oftenest the most expen - sive , but I believe they are also the cheapest in the end .

		There is not a boy within whose reach there is not some cheap form of `` Treasure Island '' or `` Kidnapped '' ; but I would rather have every boy read his

Marion Ames Taggart	PERSON	that we will take such stories of hers as `` Beth of Old Chilton '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- on the supposition that therein will be kept up some of the tradi - tions of
Louisa May Alcott	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such boy scout adventures as
Walter P. Eaton	PERSON	has been writ - ing for some years are innocuous and supply a want which has grown with the popularity of the `` series . ''

		It must be said to the credit j of Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	, however , that his latest volume `` Peanut Cub Reporter '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		has more evidence of spontaneity about it than any of the other tales that have strung together a long list of happenings `` on the hike . ''

		Among the fiction , we believe we have dis - covered nevertheless several well-written nar - ratives .

		We do not hesitate to recommend
Cornelia Meigs	PERSON	's `` Master Simon 's Garden '' -LRB- Maemillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , which gives a panoramic display of American conditions from the days of colonial Puritanism to the very moment of the Revolution .

		The tale is cleverly con - structed and follows the welfare of several generations .

		Nor does ``
Polly Trotter	PERSON	, Patriot '' -LRB- Maemillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- fall very far behind in cumulative interest and mainte - nance of atmosphere .

		Rarely has the spirit of Independence been so well suggested as in this latest volume , from the joint pens of Emilie I
B. Knipe	PERSON	and
Alden A. Knipe	PERSON	.

		And of a I further-off period of history , an excellent idea may be gleaned from
Clarence M. Case	PERSON	's `` The Banner of the White Horse '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, a tale of Saxon conquest .

		We have small space to enumerate all the stories which now flood the market .

		We can only emphasize the warning that the majority of them are indifferent , and that it is better to go to the `` standard '' list for recommenda - tions .

		One is safe in buying reprints , such i as `` Robinson Crusoe '' and the `` Pinocchio , '' which are the latest volumes included in the
Lippincott	PERSON	's estimable `` Stories All Children Love '' series .

		-LRB- Per vol. ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Fairy tales , other than the `` Allies ' Book , '' are plentiful , and there are many editions to select from .

		We like the purpose of
Penrhyn Coussens	PERSON	's `` Tales of Heroism and Daring '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- better than the execution .

		The selections are haphazardly arranged and very sketchy in wording .

		It is a book of suggestion for the story-hour , rather than a 548 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 14	DATE	distinctive story-book .


Katharine Pyle	PERSON	's `` Wonder Tales Retold '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- are enriched with effectively tinted color plates .

		A reprint of
Henry E. School	ORGANIZATION	- craft 's `` Indian Fairy Book '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- will enrich the Indian shelf of any library .

		The fairy tale as a source for dramatization is this year very evident in the issuance of school plays with explicit directions as to mounting and costuming .

		Such variety as that offered in the `` St.
Nicholas	PERSON	Book of Plays and Operettas '' -LRB- Century ; second series ,
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		and
Laura E. Eichards	PERSON	's `` Fairy Operettas '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		will find instant recogni - tion from the teacher .

		The dramatic piece as an accessory in the school-room has still to be measured carefully , the market being flooded with weak materials of little literary merit .

		The fact of the matter is , a good teacher should do her own dramatizing .

		In looking over the artistic volumes of `` Old English Nursery Tales '' -LRB- Daughaday ; per vol. ,
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, retold by
Georgene Faulkner	PERSON	, and brightly illustrated by
Milo Winter	PERSON	, we were impressed by the fact that here at hand are simple sources for converting material into dialogue form .

		But we must guard ourselves against those plays which have no other merit than that they were once tried out in the class - room .

		Act plays all you wish , but do n ' t rush too generally into print with them !

		The `` Story Lady Series , '' under the kindly guidance of Miss
Faulkner	PERSON	, suggests that maybe there are other books of similar char - acter suitable for the smallest folk in the nursery .

		We are glad to find
Sara Cone Bryant	PERSON	, in her `` Stories to Tell to the Littlest Ones '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , continuing the sensible work she has already done in the way of giving advice to story-tellers .

		Jingles and prose variously mixed are here offered in accord with all the psychological turns of style she has discovered to be pleasing to juvenile attention .

		The pictures by
Willy Pogany	PERSON	are fanciful and familiar .

		On the whole , however , the picture book is rather conspicuous by its reticent appear - ance or flagrant absence .

		Probably that is due to war and expense of manufacture .

		Many volumes before us are a strange assort - ment of different grades of paper .


E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	's `` In the Land of Make Believe '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is a gay circus book , and out of the varied supply of Christmas Feasting on my desk is the brightest oblong book we have for the `` small fry . ''

		Many parents do not even know how to approach their youngsters in the spirit of fun which should prevail in the nursery .

		So that , after a fashion , though
Gene Stratton	PERSON	-
Porter	PERSON	's `` Morning Face '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is hardly literary in form , it will sug - gest many playful things for the parent to practise on children as delightfully cheerful as the little girl whose portrait forms the wrapper design of this heterogeneous array of verses and stories .

		The youthful `` pencil - and-paper fiend '' will discover an outlet for his artistic inclinations in
Clifford L. Sher	PERSON	- man 's `` The Great Dot Mystery '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		The handy boy , the daring boy , and the young naturalist we always group together .

		They are of the same stock , and their tastes are always reckoned with in the holiday har - vest .

		Mucilage , pasteboard , odd boxes , covers , strings , and so forth are the chief characters in such practical treatises as
Edna Foster	PERSON	's `` Something to Do , Boys '' -LRB- Wilde ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Milton Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` Practical Things with Simple Tools '' -LRB-
Sully & Kleinteich	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, and
C. C. Bowsfield	ORGANIZATION	's `` How Boys and Girls Can Earn Money '' -LRB-
Forbes	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		How simple the directions seem , with the diagrams and the sleight-of-hand foldings .

		The motto for such books should be `` The Boy Useful in the
House	ORGANIZATION	Beautiful ! ''

		In these camp fire days and boy scout moments , we can recommend
Gilbert H. Trafton	PERSON	's `` Bird Friends '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, because of the encyclopedic knowledge it can throw on the special subject which other authorities , like
Neltje Blanchan	PERSON	and
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	, can not touch .

		Novelty in the animal world is always attractive to the young reader , and we can imagine many a youngster relishing
W. S. Berridge	PERSON	's `` The Wonders of Animal Life '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, with such unique chapters as those about birds that ca n't fly and fish that ca n't swim .

		What says the adventurous reader to such titles as Lieutenant
Chatterton	PERSON	's `` Daring Deeds of Famous Pirates '' -LRB-
Lippincott	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- and
Ernest Young	PERSON	's `` Daring Deeds of Trappers and Hunters '' -LRB-
Lippincott	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- ?

		Are they not descriptive enough ?

		Even though there may be similar volumes of sounder character , nevertheless are they safe and sound in spirit .


Philip A. Bruce	PERSON	's `` Brave Deeds of Confederate Soldiers '' -LRB-
Jacobs	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- likewise contains some thrill - ing historical studies .

		The market is full of such books , and you only have to know the reader 's taste to fill the bill .

		The adventurous story is also plentiful .

		There is the semi-fictional book , like
William A. Johnston	PERSON	's `` Deeds of Doing and Daring '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , of scope similar to
Cleveland Moffatt	PERSON	's `` standard '' book on the same sub - ject .

		There is Dr.
Francis Rolt-Wheeler	PERSON	's
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 549 `` The Boy with the United States Mail '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	, Lee ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , in which all the excit - ing history of the
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	is unfolded in fictional form .

		And where is the Christmas spirit in all this , you ask !

		One small volume creeps out from the deluge before us with the Yuletide cheer ; and that is
Ruth Sawyer	PERSON	's '' This Way to Christmas '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		a good little tale of lonely expectancy and rich fulfilment .

		Here space calls a halt , and we end with a plea .

		Do not shop for children hastily .

		Do not rely on the salesman who has a pile of the `` latest '' to sell .

		Look for yourself ; and prepare yourself to judge of the output by some `` standard . ''

		You can form for your - selves that `` standard '' with very little trouble with much less trouble than trying after - ward to undo a vitiated taste in the child , or counteract a lurid imagination .

		The child 's mental food is not all unadulterated .

		It is a moral duty on the part of the grown per - son to realize this and refuse to buy `` cheap goods , '' whose presence tends each year to lower more and more the `` standard '' book .

		594 SEEING IT THROUGH .

		How widely Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's latest consolation for the war will be disseminated and absorbed by this Wellsian generation we have yet to learn , but one can at least register the gravity of the situation which his latest book creates .

		There is still a possibility that Mr.
Britling	PERSON	may not be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself but rather a mere ironic portrait of the very modern Briton bouleverse by the personal thrust of the war .

		If this is so , the `` seeing it through '' to an end which materializes only in a Finite God is a touch of Wellsian humor only too deeply ironic .

		But Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's ante-bellum vivacity , his self-conscious gayety of life with its tumbling ideas , its pianolas and hockey and automobiles , its careless , vital , intellect - ual women , its nonchalant air of wanting everybody to see very clearly that the modern Englishman is intensely getting much more out of life than anybody else in the world , all this is too much of the very air that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	breathes not to make one wonder at the risk he runs and the responsibility he will undertake in getting himself misunderstood .

		If Mr.
Britling	PERSON	is not Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, his reaction to the war , his conviction of the many aspects , protests , explanations that have to be set down very clearly and confidently in pam - phlets of sonorous titles , makes him at least Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's own brother .

		And the map - revising which takes place after the death of Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's son seems to set us back into the old captivating intellectual serenity which always tried to fuse and steady and lift the emotional tangles and defeats of life without bruising them .

		But the old Wells magic is no sooner revived than a rude hand brushes over it and blots it out .

		This quick flop into religion , this opening of the flood-gates by the letter to the parents of the dead
Heinrich	PERSON	, this unstemmable plunge into the emotional abyss , with never a recovery or hint of a recovery , takes the breath away in dismay .

		Does it mean that the Mr.
Britlings	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, quenched in personal sorrow , are beginning to find their consolation in this last and least 564 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	reparable of idealisms ?

		Have they no choice but to find God ?

		It is true that , as a prag - matist , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	may have hinted at his God in his `` First and Last Things . ''

		But no one took the pragmatists to mean any more than that if there was a God , this was the kind of God he was .

		To feel that there is a God , to feel that there must be a God , would have seemed a few years ago a jump too colossal for even a tender-minded pragmatist to make , except poetically or in wistful play .

		The question that staggers us in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's book is , Just how far is he dealing in wistful play ?

		Which may lead the cynical to , Just how far does he deal in anything else ?

		What Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is up to , however , is far less important than what the people who read him will think he is up to , and whether they will , in all sincerity , allow themselves to be influenced by the consolation which he makes his hero see through to .

		The American world has been , for a number of years , in the high - est state of suggestibility toward Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		So magical is his power of seeming to express for us the ideas and dilemmas which we feel
spring	DATE	out of our modernity and stamp us with a sort of cautious self - consciousness , that a great many of us would be in a high state of suggestibility toward Mr.
Britling	PERSON	even if we were convinced that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	did not mean him to be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself .

		The dis - coverer of the Finite God has a great Amer - ican following whom each successive book tends to sweep from their emotional moor - ings .

		For several weeks after these readings , they are not quite themselves .

		Their imagina - tive life is engaged on researches magnificent , on the turning of their personal relations into passionate friendships , on thinking in large emotional international terms .

		But in a part of this following Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is fortunate .

		There are those of us who feel a flimsiness in his fabric , a slight limp in his soaring , a little uneasiness in his facile content to reiterate the dilemmas of sex and samurai rather than to make hopeful stabs at a solution .

		He seems to acquire more and more a certain brave lumi - nousness of phrase which , if dwelt on , shines so little deeper than itself .

		We continue to be swept away , but we have an anchor somewhere to windward .

		The drop of the poison of distrust has upon us the altogether happy effect of inoculating us against disillusionment .

		We get all the thrill of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and we are never disappointed in him .

		This protection was never so much needed as now .

		If Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has not capitu - lated at this all-testing crisis to an obscuran - tism against which he always so bravely contended , he is at least willing to take the responsibility of his suggestive power .

		He is willing to see us follow him into a consola - tion that is all the more insidious for his making it rush in and overwhelm the rational and realistic consolation of intelligence which Mr.
Britling	PERSON	was setting for himself .

		He is willing to have that gallery of people who are reading Mr.
Britling	PERSON	this month and will be reading him for many weeks to come set about the imaginative adventure of substituting the Finite God for the
Research Magnificent	ORGANIZATION	, or at least of building their war-consolation out of a God immensely pragmatic , I admit , immensely diluted , almost a figure that one becomes pathetic and tender about , yet unmis - takably a God .

		The effect he would produce on our minds is that somehow this Finite God would not be gainsaid .

		The combination of horrors was too potent .

		No other consola - tion would have staggered up to meet it .

		A year of butchery , tension , dread , the sacrifice of the young Hugh and the young
Heinrich	PERSON	, national and personal calamity playing into each other in the vivid personal mind , meet - ing , embracing , reinforcing each other , but did this have to end , even in the mind of the most self-consciously pagan and intellect - ual of middle-class Englishmen , in this sentimental cosmification of his own despair - ing struggle ?

		One reacts to it as to a sort of wilful bankruptcy of intellect .

		Yet our reaction would be stronger if we were not in the habit of not being disillu - sioned by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		For our slight distrust acts , as everything else seems to act , to his glory and ratification .

		If we trusted him , the shock of disillusionment would be com - plete , and we would have no more of him .

		But distrusting him , we find ourselves giving him the benefit of the doubt .

		Over here where we strain our imaginations to feel the personal shock of the war , and console our - selves with the Tightness of the cause and a nebulous vision of vast changes to come , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	tempts us to wonder if this consolation of his , were we enmeshed in its claims , per - sonally dragged in its terrible wash , would be the only one for us too .

		And the number of Americans who , under the spell of the book , will see , like a burst of light before
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 565 their eyes , how impossible it was for Mr.
Britliug	PERSON	or for any American spectator to come to any other consolation , this will be the index of what the war is doing to our educa - tion , of how far it is setting back our struggle after a modern and realistic philosophy of life .

		For some of us the benefit of the doubt will not save Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		It was bad enough for the French and Germans to erect new tribal gods to go out with their armies and smite the aggressor .

		It is bad enough to have the American bishops put a God of Hosts into their Prayer Book to proteet our soldiers and make them to '' wage war in righteousness . ''

		But these are robust and inevitable expan - sions of the old primitive popular and national religions , as unsophisticated as the objectifications of desire which savage peoples use to innate their ardor and endow them with a sense of power .

		These tribal Gods of Hosts collapse with the passing of battle .

		Only the ignorant are really moved .

		The intelligent use them only in metaphors of pious fervor .

		A Wellsian Finite God , however , is far more plausible and dangerous .

		A personal god tends to linger long after the crisis which produced him has passed .

		He is always there to help and to be helped .

		For his struggles , as Mr.
Britling	PERSON	rhapsodizes them , appeal almost to instincts of chivalry .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	finds in him all the consolations he needs for personal calamity , and he objectifies him into a Captain of
Mankind	LOCATION	.

		And such a God seems sustaining as long as he is a mere cosmified Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	leading him by the hand .

		But extend this succor to other fields of struggle .

		Are we to see Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's God as a cosmified Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	leading him by the hand to the victory of public right in
Europe	LOCATION	, or as a mystic
Russia	LOCATION	in the skies struggling hopefully along with her for the possession of Constantinople !

		The Finite God breaks down as soon as we get outside of our own private consolation , and we see the world again as contending powers controllable only as we get power sublimated into workman - ship , and superstition into intelligence .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does not disillusion us , and so we annot be angry with him .

		But his plunge into the rubbish of Captains of
Mankind	LOCATION	.

		World-Republics .

		Religion as the first and last thing , will steel our hearts against such cheap and easy consolations for calamities against which there can be no consolation .

		There is one hope left for Mr.
Britling	PERSON	that he went back to his map-drawing .

		He may have faced his God frankly for what he was , the overwhelming need of his stricken hour , the object that his desire , crushed with his sympathy for European fathers and mothers in their stricken hour , built for his consolation .

		But , created for his need , its shining face passes slowly away , and Mr.
Britling	PERSON	returns to the
Better Government of the World	ORGANIZATION	, with its recasting of frontiers , its justice that shall demand no more sacrifice .

		There are the relentless realities the need for which will not pass away .

		Otherwise Mr.
Britling	PERSON	did not see it through .

		For those who live , the world is not livable except through triumph over the despair of death , and over a religion which is little more than an evasion of that despair .

		The only consolation permitted is to feel one 's self cooperating with the intelligent forces that are making for the better ordering of the world .

		To be on the right track , that is salvation in the modern world .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	with his maps was sound in instinct and pur - pose .

		His poring put him in the current of the world 's hope .

		Past religion into creative intelligence , such effort should lead all who will resolutely seek such consolation .

		Noth - ing else is a seeing it through .

		OI TeOvane `` A noble minstrel lies dead '' and Moschus called on all the wooded vales and streams of
Sicily	LOCATION	to mourn with him for Bion whose songs they should echo no more .

		From even - corner of the earth where civilization has reached
Maeterlinck	PERSON	might ask homage to the memory of his great fellow-countryman .

		Verhaeren , whose genius found its inspiration in each new conquest of the human spirit .

		Belgian first and last no man could have a prouder title to-day his work mirrors our age in its present achievement and its aspira - tion for the future .

		For this singer of kermesse and monastery , this eloquent denun - ciator of German outrage on `` the spirit of to-day , '' has sung the epic of modern inven - tion and industry with its mastering of nature 's resources , and has dreamt the dream of the federation of the world .


Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	was born at
St. Amand	LOCATION	on the
Scheldt	LOCATION	in
1855	DATE	.

		His childhood was THE DIAL 28 spent amid rural Belgian scenes which he has lovingly described in some of his poems .

		To the end of his life he loved to return to the simple country folk among whom he grew up , and they regarded him as a friend and neighbor .

		As a boy he studied with
Maeter	PERSON	- linck and Rodenbach at the
Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe	ORGANIZATION	at
Ghent	LOCATION	, and later read law at
Louvain	LOCATION	.

		During his student days he was engaged in various literary enterprises ; it is not surprising , then , that after a brief practice at the
Brussels	LOCATION	bar he gave himself entirely to poetry .

		Car il ne reste rien que 1 ` art sur cette terre Pour tenter un cerveau puissant et solitaire Et le griser de rouge et tonique liqueur .

		But his conception of art was far from that of the romanticists who would withdraw from their fellow-men into an ivory tower to dream of impossible Utopias .

		For Ver - haeren , the artist is one who `` hails , kindles and fans that holy fire , energy '' in whatever form it presents itself .

		He would `` chisel the whole world into a lyric '' ; he would grapple with the myriad energies which our age of iron has produced and forge his Utopia from them .

		No one form of activity could satisfy him , hence his refusal to accept any of the professions offered him , his restless spirit exulted in every new conquest of human effort and his enthusiasm vented itself in pagans to the new Apollo .

		O race humaine aux astres d'or nouee , As-tu senti de quel travail formidable et battant , Soudainement , depuis cent ans , Ta force immense est secou6e ?

		Hence his love of the concentrated force of great cities les villes tentaculaires which draw into themselves the rich blood of the country and mould a new type of men whose fatherland is I ' Internationale .

		He sees in the common striving toward a great end , the progress of humanity , a new brotherhood among men .

		`` II faut aimer pour decouvrir avec genie . ''

		His vision was not destined to immediate realization .

		As I have said else - where , he chanted the triumph of life , and now the cannon , mouthpieces of the modern quest of power , are pealing back the triumph of death .

		But his vision is none the less prophetic for that ; it is shining still above the fray and offers man his one ray of hope .

		Verhaeren 's literary work consists of some twenty volumes of verse , four dramas , and a half-dozen essays .

		A rapid survey of his poetry , on which his fame rests , may serve to show the evolution , as well as the underlying unity of his thought .

		His earliest work seems to have been intended to put in literary form certain striking aspects of national life .

		His admiration for the old Flemish artists , revealed again in his critical essays , aided by recollections of his own student days , inspired `` Les Flamandes , '' in which he por - trays with vivid realism the boisterous popular festivals `` le decor monstrueux des grasses kermesses . ''

		Again , a collection of sonnets entitled `` Les Moines '' sympathet - ically describes the quiet life of the cloisters .

		In the monks Verhaeren celebrates the hero - ism of renunciation and fidelity to a lost cause , the relic of a mighty past .

		Then comes a change .

		The following volumes show the poet 's seething temperament turning inward and relentlessly tearing him .

		He had left his native land for a long period of travel and he was to pass through the dark forest before he found himself .

		In strange cities the storm and stress of the age caught and nearly swallowed him .

		He tells of his struggle in volumes of which the very titles are eloquent r `` Les Soirs , '' `` Les Debacles , '' `` Les Flambeaux Noirs . ''

		It is the revolt of a great and too self-conscious individuality which finds itself out of harmony with the universe .

		`` Mourir , comme des fleurs trop enormes , mourir / r is his cry .

		But the life instinct was strong in him and he emerged from the crisis with a new power .

		He had learned the lesson of the monk 's self-renunciation , and the overflowing zest of life of the kermesse was directed into a new channel the identification of the individual with the spirit of his time .

		His one desire is now De n ` etre plus qu ` un tourbillon Qui se disperse au vent mysterieux des choses .

		And so he throws himself passionately into every tendency of modern life .

		His admira - tion is a little tumultuous at first : energy of any sort seems an end in itself ; he feels drawn by the tense struggle in great cities and portrays in vivid imagery the migration from `` Les Campagnes Hallucinees , '' from `` Les Villages Illusoires '' toward `` Les Villes Ten - taculaires . ''

		`` Tous les chemins se rythment vers elle . ''

		Then , more marvellous than the multifarious passions and industries crowded into the metropolis , he finds a discipline , an order , which restrains and guides them toward a common goal , just as the monastic rule bends into harmony the contrasting char - acters of the monks .

		In the drama , `` Les Aubes , '' there is a sort of vision of the recon - ciliation of town and country when love supersedes strife .

		Zola tells how , shattered in mind and body , he found again moral and THE DIAL 567 physical strength by passing a year with a blacksmith .

		`` II m ` apparaissait comme le heros grandi du travail , 1 ` enfant infatigable de ce siecle , qui bat sans cesse sur 1 ` enclume 1 ` outil de notre analyse , qui faonne dans le feu et par le fer la societe de domain . ''

		Verhaeren 's evolution from the years of romantic storm and stress to his final serene outlook on life was founded on similar expe - riences .

		It is in
Verhaeren	LOCATION	's last work , `` Les Forces Tumultueuses , '' `` La Multiple Splendeur '' and `` Les Rythmes Souverains '' that his phil - osophy takes final shape .

		He has found the meaning of the separate phases of energy so triumphantly hailed in earlier volumes .

		Si nous nous admirons vraiment les uns les autres , Du fond meme de notre ardeur et notre foi , Vous les penseurs , vous les savants , vous les apotres , Pour les temps qui viendront vous extrairez la loi .

		He asks from each and all admiration and love for fellow-toilers in the great struggle which is to make man really the master of the universe , and for him complete mastery means identification of the conqueror with the con - quered .

		In this brotherhood and pantheism , is the sovereign rhythm .

		The poet 's role is that of the seer who brings his vision of the future to incite to greater effort .

		`` Nous croyons deja ce que les autres sauront . ''

		There is a wide-spread belief that Ver - haeren is the leader of the vers libristes , or at least he is constantly associated with them .

		But his sincerity and high seriousness of purpose place him far above this rather effeminate and decadent school .

		The doctrine of art for art 's sake was anathema to him .

		As a matter of fact , his earliest work is in the traditional Alexandrine , and when later he uses irregular metrical verse forms it is not through caprice or as an experiment in versification , but because in his effort to put himself into harmony with the age he felt the need of the most varied rhythm .

		Never was
Buffon	PERSON	's dictum `` le style est I ` homme meme '' better exemplified .

		Conscious of his achievement ,
Verhaeren	PERSON	has summed up his life work in magnificent verses : Celui qui me lira dans les siecles , un soir , Troublant mes vers , sous leur sommeil ou sous leur cendre , Et ranimant leur sens lointain pour mieux com - prendre Comment ceux d ` aujourd ` hui s ` etaient armes d'espoir , Qu'il sache , avec quel violent elan , ma joie S'est , a travers les cris , les revoltes , les pleurs , Ruee au combat fier et male des douleurs , Pour en tirer 1 ` amour , comme on eonquiert sa proie .

LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Cprrespondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The publishing season is almost over .

		It has naturally been a thin one , but really inter - esting books have been rather more numerous than last year .

		The booksellers are not doing badly .

		The demand for commonplace war books has fallen off , but books about condi - tions at the end of the war and narratives of personal experiences on the firing-line are selling well .

		Of the novels those which are doing best are by established authors .

		The booksellers say that the public wo n't touch novels by new authors in war-time .

		Perhaps the public , in sticking to the old novelists , is moved by an unconscious desire to cling to something familiar which remains from a period of which so much that was familiar has disappeared .

		But something must be ascribed to the shrinkage in the amount of reviewing done by the press .

		New novels are getting , as a body , very little show .

		The most discussed novel of the past month is Mr.
Gilbert Carman	PERSON	's `` Mendel . ''

		The hero is an East End Jew alleged to possess colos - sal artistic genius .

		There is a great deal of -LRB- as I think -RRB- rather windy talk about Art and Life , and the sexual atmosphere is depres - sing in the extreme .

		The most striking feature of the work is the way in which living people , scarcely disguised , are used as char - acters , and actual events are incorporated in the narrative .

		A good many young novelists are showing this tendency to go round , as it were , with a reporter 's notebook and trans - cribe their observations .

		It means death to imagination and form , though it is undoubt - edly labor-saving .

		And it is certainly irritat - ing to those readers who do not want to be bothered by wondering -LRB- whenever there is any doubt ! -RRB-

		as they come to each character , `` who it is meant to be . ''

		This question of the amalgamation of fiction and biography is , in another aspect , amus - ingly touched on by Miss
Susan L. Mitchell	PERSON	in her new critical monograph on
George Moore	PERSON	-LRB-
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	who assists `` JE '' in the Irish cooperative movement and writes comic topical verse better than anyone else in
Ireland	LOCATION	talks a good deal of sense about her subject and sprinkles it freely with jests .

		She has no reverence , and repeats descriptions of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	in which he is said to resemble a gos - ling , a boiled ghost , and a gooseberry .

		In analyzing Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's memoirs she observes that , as some novelists impute real adven - tures to characters with fictitious names , so Mr.
Moore	PERSON	imputes imaginary deeds and 568 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	words to living men .

		He writes novels about people he knows , and mixes fact and fiction with devilish ingenuity .

		Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	fore - sees a time when someone will notice the com - mercial possibilities of this form of art .

		Fashionable portrait painters will do with pen and ink what others do with paint .

		Lord
Edwin	PERSON	and
Lady Angelina	ORGANIZATION	will walk into the craftsman 's study , armed with their love - letters and particulars about the various per - sons whom they refrained from marrying .

		They will pay a substantial fee , and the result will be an extremely complimentary history of their lives .

		There has been little new poetry , most of the better poets being silent .

		Mr.

		The most interesting first book I have seen is `` The Hunter and other Poems '' by

Jackson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Turner	PERSON	, known as an exhilarating music critic , is a young man , and at present in the army .

		His imag - ination is as exuberant as his humor .

		There are only one or two perfectly satisfying lyrics in his book .

		One of these is on the not easily negotiable subject of
Cotopaxi	LOCATION	and Popo - catepetl .

		The others contain a good many obscurities and awkwardnesses due to haste which , in his case , is ascribable to an excess of vitality .

		But he has an original vision and does not imitate , and he is worth watching .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's epic on the English agricultural laborer , `` The Song of the Plow '' -LRB-
Heinemann	PERSON	-RRB- , has been a surprise to many people .

		It seemed impossible that a man could write a really readable long poem with a thousand years of agrarian history as his subject , and only a type as his hero .

		But the six thousand lines are never dull , frequently beautiful and occasionally amusing , especially when the author belabors the backs of persons he does not like , such as
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		and James I .

		The verse-form is terza rima , and monotony is skilfully avoided .

		All the impor - tant details of poor-law legislation , history of wages and so on , are audaciously sketched in and the author concludes with an appeal for economic independence for
Hodge	ORGANIZATION	after the war .

		Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	have included in their `` Golden Treasury Series '' -LRB- in which no other living author is represented -RRB- a selection from the poems of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	.

		It is being gradually realized that
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	is , to say the least , as important a poet as he is a novelist .

		His earlier verse was sometimes ungainly , and often gloomy to an almost ludicrous degree .

		He told short-stories in verse in which all the aces were put with such system into the hands of malevolent Fate that one could not help feeling that the characters were getting a far worse time than they had any right to expect .

		But with increasing age he has fallen more and more back upon his own feelings ; his verse has become strangely musical , and some of the lyrics done since his seventieth birth - day , particularly those inspired by the death of his wife , are amongst the most beautiful poetry of his time .

		I know no contemporary poem so moving as `` The Ghost of the Past '' with its subtle yet simple music .

		It begins : We two kept house , the Past and I , The Past and I ; Through all my tasks it hovered nigh , Leaving me never alone .

		It was a spectral housekeeping Where fell no jarring tone , As strange , as still a housekeeping As ever has been known .

		That Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	himself realizes the supe - riority of his later work is shown by his for I presume it to be his own selection .

		In this new edition , I may add , many of the poems are altered and improved .

		Macmillans have brought out two new books by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	: `` Reveries over Childhood and Youth '' and `` Responsibilities and other Poems . ''

		Each of these books has already appeared privately .

		I presume that they will be published , or have already been published , in
America	LOCATION	.

		`` Reveries '' has a most appro - priate name .

		The whole book is , as it were , crooned in a reminiscent monotone and the language has the uniform , even tone of things seen through a veil .

		Some passages throw a good deal of light on Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's conception of the nature and functions of poetry , and the candor of the personal reflections is the can - dor of a man talking to himself over a fire .

		In one place Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	recalls that in the fine frenzy of his youth he assumed a melan - choly air `` in memory of Hamlet , '' and was in the habit of looking at the image of his tie in shop windows , and deploring that it would not keep properly ballooned like
Byron	PERSON	's tie in the picture .

		Most men have done that sort of thing , and frank confession is rather a modern habit ; but that is just the kind of hyper-private minor frailty that it takes a really courageous man to admit to .

		Two enormous volumes of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, `` Interpretations of Literature '' -LRB-
Heinemann	PERSON	-RRB- you have probably seen on your side .

		Critics here have differed about them .

		Some com - plain that it is an insult to
Hearn	PERSON	's memory to publish his explanations to Japanese students that a thrush is a speckled bird and a primrose a small yellow flower .

		To others the insight into
Hearn	PERSON	's method of interpret - ing the West to the most alien race in the
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 569 civilized world makes the volume well worth having .

		Hearn 's catholicity is certainly illus - trated in the book .

		So is his independence of judgment , which was no doubt assisted by the fact that lie was living remote from other litterateurs and out of reach of the infections of fashion .

		A really solid work of literary criticism is `` The English Drama in the Age of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, * ' by
W. Creizenach	PERSON	-LRB- Sidg - wick and
Jackson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This is a translation of the first eight books of the fourth volume of a `` History of Modern Drama '' by a former professor of the
University of Cracow	ORGANIZATION	.

		This Pole 's erudition is imposing .

		He knows the obscurest crannies of Elizabethan literature , and his book is admirable as a manual of facts and respectable as a piece of sober critical exposition .

		Chatto and
Windus	ORGANIZATION	have begun a collected edition of the tales of Tchekov , who has hith - erto appeared here in scattered volumes .


Duckworth	PERSON	's have issued a farewell book of sketches by Mr.
R. B. Cunninghame Grahame	PERSON	, and the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, a collection of Ballads illustrating the history of Sir
Robert Wai	PERSON	- pole 's administration , excellently edited by an American scholar , Dr.
Milton Percival	PERSON	.

		The eighteenth century 's political songs are not so numerous or so good as those of the
seventeenth century	DATE	, but they are at least as coarse and abusive , and they give a good idea of what the man in the tavern thought of
Walpole	LOCATION	.

		J. C. SQUIRE .


London	LOCATION	,
December 3 , 1916	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		OUR DEBT TO PROFESSOR
MUNSTERBERG	PERSON	, who died suddenly the sixteenth of this month while lecturing to a class of Radcliffe students , is not inconsiderable .

		Among contemporary psychologists it would be hard to find one who had done more to advance the science to which he was devoted .

		It is a far cry from the `` mental philosophy ' - of our grandfathers , with its neat but arbitrary divisions and sub - divisions of the mind , to the modern concep - tion of the `` stream of consciousness '' and the present-day methods of psychological exper - iment and research ; and these methods had nowhere been more ingeniously elaborated or more fruitfully applied than in the psycho - logical laboratory established by this German scientist at
Harvard	LOCATION	, where he had taught since his call to
Cambridge	LOCATION	from
Freiburg	LOCATION	in
1892	DATE	at the age of twenty-nine .

		Born at
Dantzic	LOCATION	, he was educated there and at the universities of Leipsic and
Heidelberg	LOCATION	.

		Among the more important of his many writ - ings by no means all on psychology are `` Psychology and Life , '' `` Grundziige der Psych ologie '' -LRB- a second volume of which was in preparation at the time of his death -RRB- , `` American Traits , '' `` The Americans , '' `` Eter - nal Life , '' `` Principles of Art Education , '' `` Science and Idealism , '' `` On the Witness Stand , '' `` Psychotherapy . ''

		and `` The Eternal Values '' -LRB- of which a German edition was also issued -RRB- .

		Peculiar and distinctive was his work in applying the methods of the psycho - logical laboratory to the solution of practical problems of daily life .

		It is to the credit of the university that called him to
America	LOCATION	that small heed was paid to the recent clamor for the dismissal of this German scholar and writer .

		* THE
NEWARK	LOCATION	PRIZES FOR POETRY in praise of that fair city , which has just brought to a close the elaborate celebration of its two hun - dred and fiftieth anniversary , have been awarded ; and the curious fact reveals itself that not one of the thirteen prize-winners is a Newarker .


New York	LOCATION	talent , in the person of Mr.
Clement	PERSON	Wood , captures the first prize , of
$ 250	MONEY	, and Mrs.
Anna Blake Mezquida	PERSON	of \
San Francisco	LOCATION	wins the second , of
$ 150	MONEY	.

		To a Philadelphian , Mr.
Albert E. Trombly	PERSON	, is awarded the third , of
$ 100	MONEY	, while the ten fifty - dollar prizes go to five
New Jersey	LOCATION	compet - itors , four in other states , and one in
London	LOCATION	.

		This last , standing also last on the list , is Mr.
Ezra Pound	PERSON	, who heads his poem `` To a City Sending Him Advertisements . ''

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's is entitled `` The Smithy of God . ''

		Excepting Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, no name of wide note appears among the thirteen .

		Spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues , and a bustling manufacturing city , with no great historic or romantic background , can make only feeble appeal to the
Longfellows	LOCATION	and Tennysons of our age if we have any such .

		Yet there is no reason to doubt that the successsful com - petitors have done full justice to their pre - scribed theme .

		W.VR AS A STIMULANT TO POETRY has brought some agreeable surprises in its train of desolation and horror .

		Not merely has a poet here and there been moved to sing in martial strain , but something like a flood of verse good , bad , and indifferent , it is true , but always striving for some measure of poetic excellence seems to have been let loose with the dogs of war .

		More volumes of verse are coming from the press than ever before , and new periodicals devoted to poetry are springing up with astonishing frequency .

		570 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28 Last May	DATE	`` The Poetry Review '' made its appearance at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	`` The Poetry Journal '' vies with it in friendly rivalry on the other side of the
Charles River	LOCATION	, in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Chicago not long ago started its `` Poetry : A Magazine of Verse , '' and
Phil	PERSON	- adelphia is the home of another similar recent publication , `` Contemporary Verse . ''

		At
Alton	PERSON	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, `` The Ajax , '' chiefly devoted to verse , came out in its initial number last month .

		A further sign of the times may be read in the recent award by
Yale University of the Howland Memorial Prize	ORGANIZATION	for belles - lettres to the late
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets .

		In
England	LOCATION	the vogue of verse is almost unprecedented .

		`` In spite of every prophecy to the contrary , '' says Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , who is here to receive and convey to
Brooke	PERSON	's mother the above-mentioned prize , `` the war seems to have made poetry more popular in
England	LOCATION	than ever before .

		I judge that partly by the increase in the number of books of verse which pass before me for review .

		Anthologies from the universities ; anthol - ogies sold as chap books ; anthologies on the war ; anthologies of the poetry of the year it 's surprising how many have been published in
England	LOCATION	during the past year , and how well they have sold . ''

		Despite the number of verse-writers sacrificed to the god of war in both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, the spirit of poetry is by no means dead in either of those stricken countries .

		!

		GLORIFICATION OP PERIODICAL LITERATURE could not go much further than Mr.
Hamilton Holt	PERSON	has carried it in an article contributed to ``
Louisiana	LOCATION	School Work . ''

		He says that `` our educators are at last beginning to recog - nize that the greater part of the reading now - adays both for pleasure and for profit is in papers and periodicals rather than books . ''

		Also : `` The fact is that the living literature of to-day is in the form of pamphlets , period - icals , reprints and clippings . '

		A bound volume , ' as has been said , 4s an emeritus work , and when the author comes out in sets he is on the road to oblivion . ' ''

		Still further : `` In fact , it has been said that a man 's intel - lectual interests may be measured by the ratio of unbound to bound volumes in his working library .

		The more durable the binding , the less useful the book . ''

		And finally : `` The study of the magazine , then , supplemented by text-books and newspaper clippings , seems destined to be the next forward step in Amer - ican education . ''

		This magnification of the magazine is but natural on the part of one in Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's position .

		If an editor does not believe in the product of his daily toil , who will ?

		But some of his remarks in praise of current periodical reading matter as calcu - lated to improve the reader 's literary style -LRB- this commendation , however , is rather in the form of testimony from others than in that of independent assertion -RRB- should be taken with reservations .

		`` Whoever wishes to attain an English style , familiar but not coarse , and elegant but not ostentatious , '' can do better than to give his days and nights to magazines and newspapers .

		OUT OF THE DEPTHS the librarian of Wil - liamsport 's public library -LRB- its corporate name is the
James V. Brown	PERSON	Library -RRB- lifts up his voice .

		In his yearly report to the board of trustees , he begins : `` DE PROFUNDIS .

		The European cataclysm has affected the intellect - ual life of
Williamsport	LOCATION	as profoundly as it has influenced that of other American cities .

		Added to the deterrent to reading of a wide - spread , grim determination to hold unaltered views arrived at during the early stages of the conflict , the flood of business has per - mitted the people less time for study than in the past .

		Both moral discontent and mental feverishness have disarranged long-standing mental habits .

		Magazines and newspapers have been devoured with febrile eagerness , while statelier books of travel have been impa - tiently rejected . ''

		In the changes thus wrought in mental habits and literary tastes this ob - server notes one `` great outstanding fact '' namely , `` the emergence of a growing demand for the recognition of the absolute necessity of idealism , whether it be clothed in the visions of the pacifists , in the logic of the preachers of preparedness , or in the lofty phrases of the apostles of patriotism .

		To the realization of this ideal the public library is possibly better able to contribute than any other agency . ''

		Brave words , these last , contrasting sharply with the less hopeful utterance lately quoted in these columns from another eminent mem - ber of the writer 's profession in an adjoining state .

		FROM AN INQUIRING CORRESPONDENT , who frankly calls herself `` intensely inquisitive , '' comes a set of questions having perhaps more than private and personal interest .

		Relieved of irrelevant idiosyncrasies on the part of the typewriter , these questions are as follows : `` What , in its strictest sense , is the meaning of a writer 's license ?

		Has any writer a right to live his or her ` nom-de-plume ' ?

		How is one able to have a book published without his or her real identity becoming known , other - wise ?

		Wherein lies the difference between liv - ing under an assumed name and under a pen
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 571 name ?

		Will the fact that one is following the writer 's profession protect him so long as he lives an honest , upright life , and in no way violates the law otherwise ?

		If it is true that
Jack London	PERSON	took part in the rebellion against the Mexican Government for the sake of gaining experiences for literary purposes , can it be justified under a writer 's license under the strictest interpretation of inter - national law ?

		Has there ever been a case in the courts where , in a prosecution for using an assumed name , the plea of writer 's license and pseudonym was used ?

		Can you give citations ? ''

		In brief reply , so far as these inquiries seem to merit serious reply , it may safely be said that writer 's license , like poetic license , has no application outside of literary art .

		If one 's publisher is discreet and honor - able , there ought to be no difficulty about con - cealing one 's identity as author .

		Obviously , no `` writer 's license '' is needed to protect a person innocent of wrong-doing , and no such license will shield him from punishment for lawlessness .

		No such cases as the inquirer refers to are known to the present writer .

		AN OVERWORKED WORD , overworked in writ - ing and far more so in speech , is the verb `` say , '' especially in the third person singular of its past tense .

		All sorts of devices are adopted by practised writers to avoid too frequent repetition of `` said . ''

		Many of the fairly acceptable substitutes are familiar enough , such as `` murmured , '' `` sighed , '' `` groaned , '' `` gasped , '' `` exclaimed , '' `` cried , '' `` retorted , '' `` replied , '' `` declared , '' `` as - serted , '' and so on .

		The list of suitable synonyms and semi-equivalents is long enough to satisfy any reasonable person , so that there is little excuse for resorting to such unsatis - factory substitutes as `` smiled , '' `` laughed , '' `` frowned , '' `` scowled , '' `` shuddered , '' and other terms that do not express or even imply articulate utterance .

		A little study of the words used , or capable of being used , in place of the overworked `` said '' has been made by `` The Writer . ''

		It is a comprehensive list , suitability being sacrificed to inclusiveness , so that it need cause little surprise to learn that there are no fewer than three hundred and eighty-five verbs that might be pressed into service by a not over-scrupulous searcher for variations upon the monosyllabic `` said . ''

		From `` acceded '' to `` yowled '' there is a wide range of choice ; but why , after all , make such a bugaboo of repetition in this instance ?

		As reasonably might we alternate the use of knives and forks with chisels and chopsticks .

		EXPERT BIBLIOPOLY is now taught at the
New York Booksellers	ORGANIZATION	' School under the direc - tion of Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		The director 's name is significant : it reminds one that it is in
Germany	LOCATION	that bookselling , like so many other activities , has been raised almost to the rank of a fine art .

		At
Leipzig	LOCATION	in
1853	DATE	the Booksellers ' Training School , the first insti - tution of its kind , was started with sixty-four pupils , a number that in sixty years increased to four hundred and thirty .

		The book trade supported the school most handsomely , con - tributing more than fifty thousand marks in the year before the war .

		What has happened since is obscured by battle smoke .

		The
New York	LOCATION	school is of much later origin
1915	DATE	, we believe .

		Its coming term will comprise twenty sessions of two hours each , and will be divided into two semesters , with the busy Christmas season separating them .

		Lecturers both of academic equipment and of business experience will give instruction in such sub - jects as the history of bookselling , the use of the bibliographic tools of the trade , the details of book manufacture , types of book-buyers , the psychology of the book-buyer , when to talk to a customer and when to refrain , how to show a book , how to sell a book to a cus - tomer , how to sell him another , the art of book-display in shop and in window , and other like practical matters all for a modest fee of
ten dollars	MONEY	.

		ENLIVENMENTS TO LIBRARY ROUTINE come in various forms .

		The writer of this recalls a number of such departures from the ordi - nary course among them a bold but unsuc - cessful attempt to rob the cash drawer , where accumulated fines and other moneys excited the injudicious greed of a professional bur - glar .

		But the primary purpose of this para - graph is to invite the reader to enjoy a brief passage from Mr.
Clement W. Andrews	PERSON	's recent Report of the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In pleasing variation from the statistical and other sober records of that pamphlet , we read : `` The Librarian 's correspondence not infrequently contains proofs of the gratitude of readers for help given them by the Library , in many cases accompanying gifts of their publications or offers of special prices on them ; but it may be doubted if this feeling has actually become so intense as to lead them to personify the institution , even though one correspondent did address ` Dr.
John Crerar	PERSON	Library My dear Dr. Library . ' ''

		572 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	COMMUNICATIONS .

		VERSE FKEE OE CONFINED ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		To answer in detail the criticisms of my article on `` Poetry and Other Things '' in your
August 15	DATE	number would be a waste of time .

		A single sen - tence of mine may have been misleading , though I thought it clear enough in its connection .

		Speaking of the highly artificial form of the son - net I said : `` It is a dull ear nevertheless that does not find an increase of beauty in this com - plexity as a matter of sound or music . ''

		I did not say that complexity in itself is beautiful or that beauty increases with the degree of complexity .

		Neither did I say anything of the content of the sonnet , which , in most cases , is a matter of sound only .

		But by what perverse ingenuity do they attrib - ute to me the opinion that `` metrical rhymed verse is the only form proper to poetry , '' or that poetry is found only `` in rhymed stanza form '' ?

		I expressly mentioned blank verse as the easiest poetic form .

		Other things being equal , rhymed verse is superior to the unrhymed , certainly as a matter of music , which is largely the excuse for poetry at all .

		So alluring is it that it often con - ceals the most commonplace thought .

		Most people as well as poets `` love that beauty should go beautifully . ''

		The only criticism which goes to the heart of the matter is that of Mr.
Dolch	PERSON	, who thinks my psychology wrong .

		That it is correct up to a recent date he concedes , but in our day with the vast amount of reading we must hurry through , `` the eye fairly flits along the lines , picking up the meaning without hardly becoming conscious of the words in which it is expressed .

		Such a reader -LRB- an educated person -RRB- reads for the thought and feeling content , not for the artistry of expres - sion . ''

		If this is true , it is an excellent reason for doing away with free verse , as well as the regular forms , since prose is so much the better medium for conveying the thought and feeling content .

		Perhaps I am not an educated person but I am conscious of the words in the most rapid prose reading , and I read poetry mainly for the artistry of expression , not for information .

		There is some art in free verse , he thinks , for the division of lines is made so as to `` cause his idea to strike home with the maximum emotional effect .

		Why ?

		And if rhythm , rhyme , alliteration , beautiful and beautifully ordered words add to the emotional effect , why not employ all the elements that make for beauty and read slowly enough to enjoy them ?

		Moreover his principle would apply to prose as well as free verse to the great advantage of the space writer .

		To Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's question whether the extract from `` Antony and Cleopatra '' is prose or poetry , it is enough to say that there is no change of poetic form .

		Read aloud or spoken the listener would know no difference between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's division of lines and his .

		The rhythm , the imagery , the allusions , the entire content as well as form is unchanged .

		In turn I will ask him whether Butcher and
Lang	PERSON	's translation of the `` Odyssey '' and the '' Modern Reader 's Chaucer '' are poetry .

		Of the first , the translators , after noting the shortcomings of various verse-renderings , say : `` It is for this reason that we have attempted to tell once more in simple prose the story of Odysseus . ''

		Did they succeed ?

		In the other , they have tried to give the real Chaucer `` and nothing else , so far as Chaucer can be found in modern English prose . ''

		It will not be questioned , I sup - pose , that Homer and Chaucer were poets and their work poetry .

		What became of it ?

		If it is found in the thought and feeling content only then these are not prose translations , since nothing has been changed but the form .

		And has it escaped the notice of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	that prose also has a form ?

		With
Miss Lowell	PERSON	's contention that the lines are part of the symbol `` and quickly give the rhythm to a trained eye , '' I wholly disagree .

		The division of lines may aid the eye in noting the phrase or clause , but this would be just as true of prose as free verse .

		It would be equally true to say that `` double leading '' helps to give the rhythm .

		On her theory , moreover , free verse is built on cadence , not rhythm .

		Lines are symbols of noth - ing at all except the printer 's convenience .

		Mani - festly they are not sound-symbols as letters are .

		These , combined in words , give us the long and short , or accented and unaccented , syllables on which rhythm depends .

		When we speak of prose rhythm , we mean something entirely different , which ought to be distinguished by a different term .

		As a matter of fact , the vers librist does not divide his lines on cadence or any regular prin - ciple .

		They consist of a single syllable or a handful of words according to individual whim .

		It is free but it is not verse except in some per - verted meaning of the term .

		There is nothing in the content of poetry which may not be found , perhaps not in equal degree , in prose .

		Its emotional urge is due largely to its music , due not to length of line but structure .

		Good poetry requires a noble content as well as perfection of form , and this is equally true of prose .

		Rhythm is , however , the characteristic feature of the one and its absence of the other .

F. S. Marvin	PERSON	.

		The essays attempt to show the per - manent unifying factors which hold western civili - zation together , despite the war .

		They were given originally as lectures at the Woodbrooke Settle - ment ,

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 573 O. HENRY : A CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC .

		* There is something of peculiar appropriate - ness in the circumstance that the first biog - raphy of 0 .

		Henry is the work of the
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	Professor of English in a South - ern university .

		Poe is a name closely asso - ciated with literature in the South , and in particular with the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		0 .

		Henry is likewise associated with the South , and in particular with
Greensboro	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	, his birthplace .

		Yet neither was sectional in outlook or local in attach - ment .

		The one was exotic in spirit , eclectic in taste , international rather than national .

		in quality ; constructive genius in technique alone associates him with his native land .

		The other was essentially American in spirit , catholic in taste , geographically local and warmly human in quality ; everything but constructive genius in technique associates him with his native land .

		Yet each was a marvellous creator of types and of species ; each a genius in the technique of his art .

		Each made a permanent enlargement of our conception of the possibilities of literature .

		Each made a definite and remarkable contri - bution to world literature .

		The curiously entitled volume , which has so long been expected , is the work of a lifelong friend of Will
Porter	PERSON	and an unstinted admirer of 0 .

		Henry .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	, of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Virginia	LOCATION	, a native of
Greensboro	LOCATION	.

		Much of the drudgery incident to any con - siderable work of biography was spared the biographer in the present instance , through the indefatigable researches of the late
Harry Peyton Steger	PERSON	.

		a most enthusiastic
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	- ite .

		The author acknowledges his chief indebtedness to Mr.
Arthur W. Page	PERSON	, who not only placed all the material collected by Mr.
Steger	PERSON	at Professor
Smith	PERSON	's disposal , but greatly facilitated any biographer 's task through a valuable series of articles on 0 .

		Henry which he published in the `` Bookman . ''

		Even with all this material ready to hand , Professor
Smith	PERSON	, prompted by enthusiasm for the subject , made extended researches on his own account , covering a period of several years .

		The result is a work of rare charm and moving interest , a happy mean between the biographical and the critical study .

		The style , virile and trenchant , not too literary to shun the colloquial or too impartial to veil enthusiasm , is a genuine index of the author .

O. HENRY BIOGBAPHY	PERSON	.

$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		It is very difficult at this moment to form an estimate of the value of the best work of 0 .

		Henry .

		Only a year ago , Professor
Pattee	PERSON	in his `` American Literature since 1870 '' incautiously ventured the unmodified state - ment that
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, along with 0 .

		Henry and others , `` debauched the short story and made it the mere thing of a day , a bit of journalism to be thrown aside with the paper that contained it . ''

		And specifically he says : `` 0 .

		Henry with his methods helped greatly to devitalize and cheapen it .

		With him the short story became fictional vaude - ville .

		Everywhere a straining for effect , a search for the piquant and the startling .

		He is theatric , stagy , smart , ultra-modern ... He is flippant , insincere , with an eye to the last sentence which must startle the reader until he gasps .

		After
O. Henry	PERSON	the swift decline of the short story , the inclusion of it in correspondence courses , and the reign of machine-made art . ''

		Only a few months ago , the author of `` Vain Oblations , '' whose mor - bidezza and
New England	LOCATION	strain are so pro- nouncedly felt in her own spectacular stories , asserted that it is `` pernicious to spread the idea that
O. Henry	PERSON	is a master of the short story , '' and rashly ventured the unqualified dictum : `` 0 .

		Henry did not write the short storj r .

		O. Henry wrote the expanded anec - dote . ''

		Over against such destructive dicta , professionally inconoclastic , must be set the remarkable series of tributes , not unfamiliar to the American reading public , from many quarters , which Professor
Smith	PERSON	catalogues in his business-like chapter , entitled `` Vogue . ''

		In view of the inordinately large sales of the works of certain other contemporary Amer - ican authors , which are conspicuously defi - cient in literary excellence , no great significance attaches to the fact of the enormous sales of sets of 0 .

		Henry 's works .

		The most impressive tribute to the effect of the genius of
O. Henry	PERSON	upon his contempo - raries was the tribute paid to his memory by his admirers in all parts of the
United States	LOCATION	so soon after his death .

		The contributions for this memorial , which was erected in the capital of his native state , expressed not less the admiration of his American fellow-crafts - men for the art and technique of
O. Henry	PERSON	, the writer , than the affection felt by his friends for
William Sidney Porter	PERSON	, the man .

		The volume before us embodies a group of distinctive and notable features .

		The opening note in the symphony , let us say , arrests atten - tion ; the prelude '' The Life and the Story '' is a remarkable instance of critical divina - tion .

		Owing to the startling nature of the disclosures set forth in chapter six , disclo - 574 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	sures hitherto given only subterranean cur - rency , yet long known to real students of
Porter	PERSON	's life , many of the newspaper re - viewers have grievously distorted the perspec - tive of the book by treating these revelations as a sort of superb `` newspaper scoop . ''

		Surely the admirable literary qualities of the chapter deserve praise fully commensurate with the regrettable notoriety attaching to the chapter because of its features of morbid popular interest .

		Already , the reviews are beginning to exhibit a healthier appreciation of the merits of the work as a whole .

		No review which fails to survey the work in its entirety can lay claim to attention as just consideration .

		It is worthy of note that the chapter in which the author takes perhaps the liveliest relish and `` lets himself go '' with the most refreshing zest , is the chapter entitled `` Favourite Themes . ''

		This chapter is not an integral part of the biography of
Will Porter	PERSON	: it is a critical appreciation of the mental furniture and appointments of a literary figure invented by
Will Porter	PERSON	and fantas - tically denominated `` 0 .

		Henry . ''

		It might be published separately as an essay on the art and genius of 0 .

		Henry .

		From the standpoint of perspective , it is not wide enough in its survey ; we do not see all of 0 .

		Henry , but only the part that Professor
Smith	PERSON	particularly relishes .

		In a word , the many glaring faults of his art , the excessive use of slang , the smart-aleckisms which bear the sign manual of the fifteen-cent magazine , the purely anecdotal side of not a few of the stories , the plays on words , sometimes sin - gularly clever , which not infrequently degen - erated into rather inexpensive jocularity , the electrifying final surprises which completely subvert the reader 's position and mockingly leave him thus topsy-turvy , these and other faults are ignored .

		As a sort of `` golden treasury '' of 0 .

		Henry 's best things , it is admirable ; a comparison between
Irving , Poe	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and 0 .

		Henry , which con - cludes the chapter , is a notable illustration of Professor
Smith	PERSON	's powers in criticism .

		Per - sonally , I feel that the stories contained in `` The Gentle Grafter '' and `` Heart of the West , '' and the peculiar qualities they possess , have met with something not unlike neglect at Professor
Smith	PERSON	's hands .

		The attention accorded to the chapter , '' The Shadowed Years , '' is due in no small degree to the dubiety aroused in the reader 's mind in regard to
Porter	PERSON	's guilt or innocence .

		My friend , the able lawyer , tells me that , from the standpoint of evidence , the biographer does not clear
Porter	PERSON	: his flight savors of guilt rather than innocence ; his lavish habitual generosity well accords with appropriation of small funds ; his furtiveness of look in entering public places bears the mark of one who has sometime gone wrong .

		Strangest of all , most inexplicable of all , is his failure to defend himself , his listlessness in the face of the grave charge of embezzlement of funds .

		The last fact arouses the suspicion , in my own mind , that
Porter	PERSON	was innocent , and gives point to the long-familiar rumor that in keep - ing silent and waiving defence he was really shielding someone else .

		A very close student of
Porter	ORGANIZATION	's
Texas	LOCATION	life tells me that a minute examination of the evidence of the trial has convinced him that
Porter	PERSON	was guilty ; another , who knew
Porter	PERSON	intimately , assures me that
Porter	PERSON	was utterly incapable of committing the crime with which he was charged .

		What - ever be the truth , and the man 's personality and character alike cry aloud his innocence , certain it is that his biographer has defended , with a true chivalric spirit , the memory of his friend .

		And further , we may say that the moral purgation of the prison life has so effectively demonstrated itself to the biographer 's mind that this idea of regen - eration links up and gives definite character to the book , from chapter to chapter , from prelude to finale .

		In disproof of the statement that 0 .

		Henry - had no vital associations with
North Carolina	LOCATION	, let me say that I published a memorial essay in connection with the erection of the national memorial in
Ealeigh	LOCATION	, in
1914	DATE	, setting forth in detail certain facts in the case .

		Somewhat later , I published a letter in `` The Nation '' -LRB-
January 14 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- dealing with the same subject .

		It has been treated fully in chapter four of the present volume , `` Birthplace and Early Years . ''

		It is the story of
Porter	PERSON	's life in the town of
Greensboro	LOCATION	, where he and
Smith	PERSON	grew up as boys together .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	, with the loving touch of reminiscence and the skilled pen of the mature critic , has placed 0 .

		Henry in his native environment as a jeweller places the sparkling gem in its true setting .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has forever fixed this `` somnolent little Southern town '' upon the literary map of
America	LOCATION	.

		This was as truly ``
W. S. Porter	PERSON	land '' as certain sections of
New York City	LOCATION	are now termed `` 0 .

		Henry land . ''

		The metropolitan writers have hith - erto `` placed '' the great short-story writer , 0 .

Bagdad	LOCATION	on the Subway . ''

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 575 AFRICA AND THE GREAT WAR .

		* Out of the host of books that have emerged to throw , each in a different way , some light on the causes of the Great War , this by Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	stands alone , and is unlikely to be eclipsed unless Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	himself should write another to surpass it .

		There is prob - ably no man better qualified to take a broad and comprehensive view of this vast subject .

		In compressing within a book of five hundred pages the diplomatic story of the plundering of
Africa	LOCATION	since
1899	DATE	, he has attempted some - thing new and has accomplished what many a bold writer would have thought impossible .

		For this is a readable book , as well as a store - house of forgotten facts and necessary infor - mation that lead one as by a row of lights to understanding .

		From first to last the reader will be absorbed .

		After turning the last page many a man will order every other work by the same writer , for that is the compelling nature of Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	's pen .

		But whatever the polit - ical or national convictions of the reader chance to be , let him make ready to abandpn one after another while he reads ; because Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	has so marshalled indubitable facts as to disperse the ignorance befogging the minds of many of us .

		He leaves us finally without any confidence at all in the truthful - ness or good intentions of the recognized vendors of international news , but with a greater faith in the peoples of the earth , as distinguished from their leaders .

		The book is not without faults , some due to haste that are likely to be corrected in the next edition .

		One hardly expects from Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	such `` howlers '' as the old familiar `` whom are '' and `` whom were '' ; yet there they stand on pages 423 and 471 respectively .

		Neither is there any obvious reason why a scholar with his command of lucid literary English should descend to such phrases as `` on the outs with . ''

		Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	's acquaintance with
Africa	LOCATION	is vast , but it is not difficult at times to distin - guish between those parts of it in which he has dwelt and whose high officials are his friends , and those other colonies that he has studied with no ordinary grasp and vision but nevertheless from a distance .

		For instance , they are not
P. & 0	ORGANIZATION	.

		Steamers , but B. I. that call at East African ports .

		He confuses the words
Uganda	LOCATION	and
Baganda	LOCATION	, in ignorance of the fact that
Uganda	LOCATION	is a country where a
Baganda	LOCATION	dwells , and that a
Baganda	LOCATION	is one of many

		By
Herbert Adams Luganda	PERSON	.

		And it is likely to confuse the uninitiated when , by a slip on page 211 , he puts
Uganda	LOCATION	and
Abyssinia	LOCATION	on the
West Coast	LOCATION	.

		There are errors of judgment , too .

		He omits consideration of the influence of women on the politics and future of
South Africa	LOCATION	, a strange omission when one remembers that almost the entire Boer intelligence depart - ment was of the fair sex during the greater part of the Boer War , and he fails to reckon with the extent to which fusion of the races must depend on wearing down feminine conservatism .

		One might wish , too , that he had dwelt at greater length on the missionary influence -LRB- so largely international -RRB- that has such weighty effect on `` home '' opinion .

		He makes the statement that `` Denominational - ism in missionary propaganda is criminal folly '' ; and most of the world is about ready to agree with him so far ; but Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	surely could go further and it is pity that he refrains .

		There is too much
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	in the book not very much , but too much .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's opinions have been proved worth - less so often , and his trip to
East Africa	LOCATION	was of such short duration , that to cite him as an authority causes irritation .

		In fact , on page 296 , Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	is at pains to show the van - ity of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's prophecies , thus arous - ing wonder why
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	was dragged in .

		Here and there expressions of opinion will not pass unchallenged .

		But on the whole there are very few faults to cavil at .

		Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	stoutly denies any tendency to pro-Germanism , and in fact if he shows any favoritism , it is toward those British officials of the upper class on whose disinterested ser - vices the empire has been built .

		It is possible that close personal friendships and admira - tion for honesty of purpose may have blinded him a little to a few besetting sins .

		He makes no secret of his belief that British Crown Colonies are likely to suffer in the future from scarcity of such men , so many of whom were slaughtered in the early stages of the war .

		So far as laxity of administration in the early days and harshness of present rule goes , he spares
Germany	LOCATION	much that might be told against her .

		He absolves the Germans alto - gether from plotting for revolution in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and gives them full credit for their sportsman-like defence in the Kamerun and
East Africa	LOCATION	.

		He finds them worthy of all praise in
Togoland	LOCATION	, and not too badly to be blamed in other parts .

		Wherein they are guilty is that they attempted , rather too late in the day in
Africa	LOCATION	, what all the other 576 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	powers did just in time to keep ahead of them .

		After reading this book one does not sym - i pathize the less with
Belgium	LOCATION	in her misery ; but one is reminded of the misery
Belgium	LOCATION	!

		inflicted on the
Congo	LOCATION	, and of Belgian pub - I lie opinion that refused redress .

		The fact is brought out that
France	LOCATION	, now fighting in defence of
Belgium	LOCATION	and clamorous at outrage , has a black record of her own in the
French Congo	LOCATION	.

		The account of German butchery and near-extermination of
Herreros	PERSON	in
West Africa	LOCATION	is offset presently by British treatment of the Zulus in
Natal	LOCATION	.

		And the sale of liquor by the Portuguese to natives south of the Equator is at least balanced by British sales of gin to natives of the
West Coast	LOCATION	.

		The Portuguese and Belgians suffer most in the final comparison , because they have accom - plished so little good to counterbalance all the slavery and robbery and worse .

		But the Italians fare very little better .

		Granting the premise that
Africa	LOCATION	can not be left to evolve a civilization of its own , Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	ends with a strong plea for
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He succeeds in proving that the successful efforts of the other powers to keep
Germany	LOCATION	out of
Africa	LOCATION	have been largely responsible for the suspicious , exasperated , and at last pugnacious growth of German thought , edu - cated as is the political thought of all the nations by a few men who are able to lead public opinion in the direction opposite to that the public itself intends .

		He says that the Allies have expressly undertaken to uphold
Belgium	LOCATION	's rights on the
Congo	LOCATION	, and those of
Portugal	LOCATION	in both East and
West	LOCATION	; but he distinctly raises a doubt as to their intention to keep faith with
Portugal	LOCATION	, and he leaves the reader wondering whether should the Allies win the war their wisest , safest , sanest course would not be to hand over the
Congo	LOCATION	and the Portuguese possessions en bloc to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is along the north coast of
Africa	LOCATION	that Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	is most at home , and his chapters on
Morocco	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	are among the best in the book .

		His hearty approval of British method in
Egypt	LOCATION	has not prevented him from discussing its limitations ; and his explana - tion of the Egyptian Nationalist movement is clear and convincing .

		His definition of Moslem fanaticism is new and well worth study .

		In fact , the whole book is worth study ; it is difficult to read it without reach - ing out for works of reference and trying to master within the hour what Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	has been studying down the years .

		Such books are few and far between .

		The greatest service Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	renders perhaps is this : that he shows no one great nation to be much blacker than another .

		All have been plunderers , all are guilty of atrocious murder in the past , and
Germany	LOCATION	is only doing now to all the others what each of the others has already done elsewhere .

		It is impossible to read the book and not see the absurdity of recrimination , or not to see the great good that might be done , almost by a stroke of the pen , in a reasonable re-division of
Africa	LOCATION	that would give
Germany	LOCATION	her share .

		The best men of all the nations would be none too many for the task of civilizing
Africa	LOCATION	, and the worst men of any nation have no business there .

		The pity of it is that there are not more men like Dr.
Gibbons	PERSON	, in all the countries now at war , to explain to the misled men who fight , the length and breadth and depth and despicable rottenness of the in - trigue , self-named diplomacy , that has blinded them and brought them to this present pass .

		He takes the history of each separate colony in turn , holds it to the light , and shows with - out malice but without favor things that the people of no nation in the world would have tolerated for a moment , could they but have been convinced of the truth in time .

		Yet , because of the inherent decency of most men , he leaves us confident of a future in which
Africa	LOCATION	may forget that men called her `` Dark '' and - Darkest . ''

		TALBOT CLASSIC UTTERANCES OF AMERICAN STATESMEN .

		* In `` The Collier Classics '' is projected a series of books similar to the so-called `` five foot shelf '' of which President
Eliot	PERSON	was the editor .

		Its purpose , as stated in the intro - duction by the general editor , Professor
William Allen Neilson	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, is to give to the public the second best of the world 's thought and reasoning .

		All the ideas and the cultures of the present are being re-studied and re-valued in the light of the great war in
Europe	LOCATION	; and hence the common man must have the best things , for which he is supposed to stand , placed before him again , in order that he may test them and find whether they are worth retaining , worth fighting for , as one is tempted to think was in the mind of the editor when he wrote his introduction .

		This great body of material , which in universality of appeal is only just below the `` five foot shelf , '' is to be issued * AMERICAN STATESMEN , from
Washington	LOCATION	to
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		Edited by
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	, LL.D .

		In five volumes , with frontispiece portraits .

		By subscription .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 577 in groups of volumes .

		The first group , edited by Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	, now published , treats of
America	LOCATION	, rather of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This is to put the cart before the horse , for the ideals and cultures now being weighed in the balances of war date back to the
thirteenth century	DATE	.

		They are English , French , German , and American in the main ; and to set all the best of these before us , in so far as books may present such things , it would have been more logical to begin at the beginning .

		Still one must not quarrel with the minor details of an important contribution or col - lection .

		What we have here is the body of patriotic material on which the people of the
United States	LOCATION	have been fed , if one may use such a vulgar term .

		To be sure , it is not all contained in these five small volumes , very pretty and flexible , ready for the pocket when one is about to take a journey ; but the best is fairly represented , and the selections cover enough of the field of American political , economic , and social history to satisfy most people , especially those who do not seek origins but effects .

		Something from the sea rovers of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, pages from Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	on `` The Beautiful Empire ` of
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, '' from
John Twine	PERSON	on the proceed - ings of the
Virginia House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, and from
Charles Sumner	PERSON	on the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	, indicate the character of the earliest selec - tions .

		Perm 's account of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in
1684	DATE	, and
Franklin	PERSON	's portrait of himself as he first entered
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, with his small bundle of luggage and his two loaves of bread pro- | trading from his pockets , may be taken as representative of the character of the mater - i ial which describes the patriots and statesmen ; of the middle region about
1700	DATE	; while two or three selections from the greatest of Amer - ican wits of the time ,
William Byrd	PERSON	of Vir - \ ginia , set forth a certain ideal of that ancient ; dominion .

		And there are typical writings of
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, the Adamses ,
Hamilton	LOCATION	, and
John Hancock	PERSON	for the first period of the Revolutionary quarrel .

		The first of the five volumes closes with the outbreak of the Revolution .

		The second volume introduces the reader to
Tom Paine	PERSON	in his `` Times That Try Men 's Souls '' ; to
William H. Drayton	PERSON	, j the
South Carolina	LOCATION	`` fire-eater , '' who proposed the dethronement of
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		; to Washing - ton ,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
George Rogers Clarke	PERSON	, and , other leaders of politics and thought for the period of the Revolution and the constitu - tional reaction , closing with
Francis Hopkin	PERSON	- son 's `` Inconveniences of Independence . ''

		The third , fourth , and fifth volumes bring the series of selections down to
1861	DATE	, a very convenient place for a pause .

		In the latter volumes there are representa - tive literary , political , or philosophical expres - sions from
John Randolph	PERSON	,
Henry Clay	PERSON	,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	,
James K. Polk	PERSON	, and other ardent-minded Americans of the middle period of our history .


John Randolph	PERSON	's witty and stinging account of the weakness of the
Jefferson	PERSON	administration in
1806	DATE	is one of the best things , both as polit - ical attack and as keen satire , contained in these volumes .

		The quality of this and the other selections from
Randolph	PERSON	give rise to the feeling that an edition of the writings of that literary and oratorical genius ought to be collected and published .


John Quincy Adams	PERSON	appears quite as frequently as
Randolph	PERSON	, and the contrast between the spirits of the two men is clearly shown .

		If each was a patriot and a statesman , then it would seem that they must have been patriots and statesmen of different countries and entirely different ideals , or perhaps one might say that each was a patriot at certain times and a politician at certain other times .

		In none of these volumes is there a poor or unrepresentative selection , except , perhaps , in connection with military matters .

		Profes - sor
Hart	PERSON	has somehow , in the busy days of the last twelvemonth , found time to read a vast amount of American historical writing and to select the best for these volumes .

		I think no one will complain at the quality of what is here presented , nor find fault with the editing , unless one must complain at .

		the proofreading which allowed
Jacob Wirt	PERSON	to stand for
William Wirt	PERSON	-LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 274 -RRB- , or the `` venerable Ashury '' for Bishop Asbury of missionary and Methodist fame -LRB- Vol .

		IV. , p. 146 -RRB- .

		On another score , however , there is some - thing to be said .

		During the last ten years a vast body of material has been gathered and data collected which compels the historian to take a wider range .

		And since Professor
Hart	PERSON	's work is designed to present material representative of all that our statesmen stood for , one may ask why there is not somewhat more to show why the Fathers worked with such feverish earnestness for a new constitu - tion in
1787	DATE	.

		Even in Professor
Hart	PERSON	's second volume there is good evidence that the country was recovering from the ills which gave rise to so much complaint , but nothing is included to show the economic interests which underlay the whole agitation for a con - stitution against which no man could raise his voice without being branded by Washing - ton and the rest as fools or knaves .

		578 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	Nor is there anything to show what really underlay the
Hayne	PERSON	-
Webster	PERSON	debate .

		Surely all good scholars know ere this that it was no more
Webster	PERSON	's devotion to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	than it was
Hayne	PERSON	's attachment to disunion that gave meaning to that famous debate .

		It was
Benton	PERSON	's scheme to reduce the price of public land in the West to a point considered by the East as dangerous to her interests which moved
Webster	PERSON	to his eulogy of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps
Benton	PERSON	's speech of
1826	DATE	would have been more enlightening than either
Hayne	PERSON	's or
Webster	PERSON	's thrusts at each other .

		Of Clay there is a great deal in these volumes , but nothing which reveals the real Clay at any critical time , say
1825	DATE	,
1833	DATE	, or
1843	DATE	.

		Per - haps Clay 's writings do not supply the histor - ian with fair and full views of his character and purposes .

		But the most questionable feature of the work is the emphasis which it places upon the jingo element in the utterances of our states - men .

		On an early page we find this quota - tion : '' Go on therefore renowned gentlemen , fall on resolvedly , till your hands cleave to your swords , your swords to your enemies ' hearts , your hearts to victory . ''

		In the second volume
Washington	LOCATION	is quoted as saying : `` Building up an army requires time , '' and the thought is so frequently ` repeated in every possible way that one begins to wonder whether the subject has not somehow got the better of the editor 's judgment .

		Without undertaking to enumerate the many pages which are occupied with the problem of mil - itary preparedness , it is perfectly plain that this is the theme of the work , its very raison d'etre .

		The word `` preparedness '' appears eleven times in the titles of the selections of the third volume alone ; and such phrases as `` squeak the fife and beat the drum , '' `` living happily like the Chinese , '' `` defenselessness of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' `` religious necessity of a navy , '' `` not to be kicked into war , '' etc. , make the tables of contents read much like the campaign speeches of Mr.
Eoosevelt	PERSON	.

		The effect on the mind of the reader is that our country is now and ever has been utterly undefended , and that every one should wax indignant at the half-criminal negligence of American leadership .

		Whether Professor
Hart	PERSON	really desired to make use of his oppor - tunity for purposes of propaganda is open to question .

		He is one of the best known of American historians ; he has trained many of the younger scholars who are now teach - ing and writing American history .

		It is therefore difficult for the reviewer to believe such a thing of him .

		Yet there is now and has been these two years past a powerful movement in this country to commit it to the policy which has wrecked
Germany	LOCATION	: the policy which began in the over-emphasis of nationalism under
Bismarck	PERSON	and concluded in the raw and brutal doctrine that might makes right .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	the greatest historians became avowed preachers of the cult , and they went so far as to re-write the history of ancient Kome to prove that all that was good in the great republic entered into
Caesar	PERSON	, who was made a god ; and that the Hohenzollerns are the modern Caesars .

		We can not read von Treitschke ,
Mommsen	PERSON	, or von Sybel without realizing that we are reading masterful pam - phleteers .

		But pamphleteers became the great masters of young
Germany	LOCATION	in the late eighties ; and the German school of historians became the model for the rest of the world for the reason that in this school there was ample evidence of great learning .

		Shall we produce the next school of pam - phleteers and call them historians ?

		There is grave danger of this , and the book under review is a fine example of how to begin the undertaking .

		Patriotism and nationalism are the slogans of bad men as well as good .

		There have always been leaders of the American people who talked brutally and urged young men to seize other people 's territory , who swaggered and blustered their way to high station , and who because of their station may now be quoted with effect .

		There are many powerful men in this country to-day who want nothing quite so much as scholars who will find them the justification for deriding democracy and for endeavoring under the guise of patriotism to bring about the over - throw of whatever of popular government we have been able to maintain .

		They admire
Germany	LOCATION	and intend to imitate her efficiency : they demand of our government the kind of protection in every market that
Germany	LOCATION	has given her corporations ; they hope to make of our free and easy society something quite different from democracy .

		Nothing aids them more than to have historians and scientific men point out the absurdity of popular gov - ernment and the blessings of universal mil - itary service , for wherever the German system of universal service has been adopted popular initiative and popular control of affairs have quickly died .

		Stability , as they think , succeeded ; order and social stratifica - tion took the place of disorder and the impu - dent assumption of airs on the part of `` nobodies . ''

		It matters not whether a people call their system democratic , republican , or what not , the real powers are likely to assert themselves , and in our country these powers are economic .

		They do not believe in any
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 579 system that denies them the first places at the common counsel board .

		The fear of the reviewer in laying down these volumes is that one of the ablest of American historians has unwittingly allowed himself to be used by those whom he would immediately denounce if their true character were made evident .

		Nor can we believe Pro- fessor
Hart	PERSON	would for a moment think of becoming , even in a mild way , a sort of
American von Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our history should rise above mere nationalism , far above par - tisan or sectional bias , and should set examples of truth for truth 's sake .

		It should show men how the world came to be what it is , and not how any particular nation may become a world power or an empire .

		We are citizens of the world , not of the
United States	LOCATION	, as
Jefferson	PERSON	and many another of our Revolu - tionary leaders were fond of saying .

		What better place shall we have in the world than the Germans or others who have perverted history if we too worship at the shrine of nationalism , which is only a sort of provincial - ism ?

		On this terrible and inexcusable form of barbarism the religious and ethical systems described in these volumes are strangely silent .

		The Friends , we are told , condemn it , and the
Ethical Movement	ORGANIZATION	seeks its suppression by an international organization .

		The trifling arti - cle on Internationally does not touch upon it , and there is no treatment of Cosmopolitan - ism .

		The composite articles on ideas and insti - tutions are often exceedingly valuable , each subdivision being treated by some eminent specialist .

		In many instances it would be difficult to find anywhere else a more authori - tative and comprehensive discussion .

		Differ - | ent conceptions of their task by the various | writers could scarcely be avoided , and the !

		Under Ethics we have a bright pic - ture of the ancient Germans , while the Celts present a very gruesome aspect .

		In the ' former case the virtues were used for classifi - cation , in the latter the vices ; and the one - sidedness of Tacitus is as evident as that of j Cicero or
Cassar	PERSON	, though it had a different !

		cause .

		One writer gives a description , from i fragmentary sources , of the moral character - istics of a pagan nation , another his idealistic j conception of what constitutes Jewish or j Christian ethics .

		In a number of articles of I this type there is a regrettable lack of com - prehensiveness .

		Thus , under the caption of j Drama , much curious and interesting infor - mation is given concerning this form of poetry among native Americans , Arabs , Chinese , Japanese , Jews , Persians , and Polynesians , and there are good descriptions of the Greek , Indian , and Roman drama .

		But the reader finds to his amazement that there is no discus - sion of French , Spanish , Italian , English , Ger - man , or Scandinavian drama .

		A separate article is indeed devoted to
Ibsen	LOCATION	; but there are none on
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Corneille	LOCATION	,
Metastasio	LOCATION	,
Holberg	PERSON	,
Echegaray	PERSON	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	, or
Maeter	PERSON	- linck .

		Similarly , the article on Literature deals with the writings of Babylonians and Egyptians ,
American Indians	ORGANIZATION	and Dravidians , Chinese , Brahmins , and Parsis ; but there is no attempt to appreciate from the standpoint of religion and ethics the great literatures of European peoples in recent times .

		The great article on
Education	ORGANIZATION	describes and discusses everything within its scope except the systems of higher and lower education in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in the last centuries .

		The prceceptor Germanice is not mentioned , and there is no article on Melanchthon .

		Japanese marriage is described , but not Chinese .

		Such perplexing gaps are noticeable also in the religious field .

		In reviewing the first ; volume -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Nov. 16 , 1909	DATE	-RRB- , the pres - j ent writer expressed the hope that there would be more separate articles on the leading gods .

Marduk	ORGANIZATION	, Assur ,
Horus	LOCATION	, i Chemosh , or even Yahwe .

		Originally there \ seems to have been a purpose to devote an | article to the god of the Hebrews .

		In Volume VI .

		-LRB- p. 254 -RRB- there is a reference to
Jahweh	PERSON	-LRB- the J to be pronounced in German fashion -RRB- for the occurrence of the name in Babylonian documents .

		Under the title Jahweh there is only a reference to
Israel	LOCATION	, where these docu - ments are not mentioned , and there is no com - prehensive discussion of the name .

		It is in vain to look for
Moses	PERSON	, for there is no article on this personage , scarcely touched upon at all in the discussion of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		Ancient
Israel	LOCATION	has been strangely neglected in this encyclo - paedia .

		There are no articles on Amos or
Hosea	LOCATION	,
Isaiah	PERSON	or
Jeremiah	PERSON	.

		One of the great masterpieces of the world 's literature , Job , is nowhere discussed .

		The Old Testament , under the heading `` Bible , '' was assigned to a distin - guished New Testament scholar , Dr.
Sanday	PERSON	, who thinks it probable that the nucleus of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	was committed to writing by
Moses	PERSON	, `` whose figure must exceed that of the grandest of the later prophets '' ; he gives a few lines to these , mentions Job , and discusses at great length questions of canonicity and inspiration .

		While every holy city of
India	LOCATION	seems to be remembered ,
Jerusalem	LOCATION	is for - gotten ;
Bethlehem	LOCATION	and

		Dr.
W. T. Davison	PERSON	describes the `` Biblical and Christian God '' from the standpoint of an almost unwavering orthodoxy .

		There are a few pathetic touches of modernism .

		`` It may not lightly be taken for granted , '' he says , `` that the God of

1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 581 ground .

		From the author 's standpoint , how - ever , this latter is not an easy thing .

		Where the fundamental conceptions are so different it can not but be extremely difficult to realize the historic problems and to appreciate the full force of philological and exegetical argu - ments .

		Thaumaturgic powers , sinlessness , a Messianic consciousness based on metaphysical uniqueness , virgin birth , resurrection , and ascension are readily assumed by one who is able to conceive of Jesus as a god walking on earth in order to discover by personal exper - ience and `` to taste what it is to be a man '' ; while the scholar whose chief interest is to find out , by ordinary historic methods , by textual and literary criticism , and by retrover - sion of the sayings recorded in Greek into the Aramaic vernacular of Jesus , what manner cf man he was , what were his ideas and ideals , and what is the moral value of his contribu - tions to the life of the race , as naturally comes to take it as a matter of course that the prophet of
Nazareth	LOCATION	was a human being , and not something else .

		When the character of the sources is considered , it is no more remark - able that `` liberal '' interpreters should differ in details , or even in the general estimate .

		than it is in the case of many other subjects of historic investigation .

		The curious alli - ance of orthodoxy with the ill-founded scepti - cism of
Smith	PERSON	and
Drews	PERSON	is not likely to stop the scientific quest for the real Jesus of his - tory .

		Writing on the Gospels , Dr.
Burkitt	PERSON	dates
Mark 65-70 A. D.	PERSON	,
Matthew 80-100 A. D.	PERSON	,
Luke 100 A. D.	PERSON	, and
John 100-110 A. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		He clearly shows what must be thought concern - ing the historic worth of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	; as is common at the present time , he exagger - ates the age and significance of Mark .

		Dr.
Sanday	PERSON	, in his article on the
Bible	LOCATION	, identifies the synoptic source sought by modern scholars with the
Matthaean Logia of Papias	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does not mention that
Papias	PERSON	only knew of an Aramaic work of
Matthew	PERSON	, now lost , and that many scholars have regarded a translation of this work as the nucleus of our
Greek Matthew	ORGANIZATION	.

		An instructive sketch of the sixteen branches of the
Greek Orthodox Church	ORGANIZATION	is given by Dr.
Troitsky	PERSON	; it contains , however , no description of its leading theologians or spiritual life .

		There are no articles on
Barna	LOCATION	- bas ,
Hermas	LOCATION	,
Ignatius	PERSON	,
Clement	PERSON	of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Clement	PERSON	of
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Irenaeus	LOCATION	, or the
Apostolic Fathers	ORGANIZATION	in general ; although
Basilides	LOCATION	,
Marcion	PERSON	, and Montanus are remem - bered .

		Dr.
Scott	PERSON	thinks it possible to recon - struct the earlier type of Gnosticism , before the great systems , from our third century works , and regards the Hermetic literature as `` our chief existing record of pre-Christian gnosticism '' ; while Dr. Stock -LRB- writing on
Hermes Trismegistus	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- concludes that `` these works were composed between A. D. 313 and 330 , '' Dr.
Scott	PERSON	does not mention the pagan gnosticism of the Mandaeans , treated in a masterly manner by Dr.
Brandt	PERSON	.

		In his eulogy of Luther , Dr.
Jacobs	PERSON	glosses over both the serious faults of the great reformer and his peculiar attitude to the canon of Scrip - ture .

		Dr.
Orr	PERSON	, in his apologetic way , frees
Calvin	PERSON	from all responsibility for the judicial murder of Servetus , and makes no mention of his attitude of Castellio .

		Flacius is deemed more worthy of an article than
Melanchthon	PERSON	; his importance as an exegete is overestimated .

		Denck and
Franck	PERSON	, like
Castellio	PERSON	, are passed over in silence ; but there is an article on Enthusiasts , reminding one of the
Pantheon Anabaptisticum	LOCATION	, where the heresies of some of their less clear-headed friends are recorded ; and the catalogue is continued down to date , without omission of Mohammed , who is treated after the manner of Marraccio .

		Thus it happens that
Frank Sanford	PERSON	and ``
Elijah	LOCATION	''
Dowie	PERSON	are introduced where there is no place for
Finney	PERSON	and
Moody	ORGANIZATION	,
Channing	LOCATION	,
Beecher	PERSON	, and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, any more than for Bourdaloue ,
Bossuet	LOCATION	, and
Fenelon	PERSON	, or Lamennais and
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		One phase of American theology is interestingly described in Dr.
Warfield	PERSON	's article on
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	, and a graceful tribute is paid to
Emerson	LOCATION	by Dr.
J. M. E. Ross	PERSON	, a Presbyterian minister .

		The various aspects of Buddhism are , as a rule , presented with ample knowledge and good judgment ; but Dr.
Geden	PERSON	's statement -LRB- God , Buddhist -RRB- concerning
Gautama	LOCATION	that `` in all probability he himself shared the ordinary views of his contemporaries as regards the being and nature of God '' is a sheer assumption , without any foundation in our oldest sources , and contrary to the general tenor of his teaching .

		Dr.
Margoliouth	PERSON	's treat - ment of Mohammed is characterized by great learning , keen criticism , and an almost total lack of sympathy .

		He proceeds on `` the theory that Islam is primarily a political adventure , '' and maintains that `` it is impos - sible to find any doctrine which he is not pre - pared to abandon in order to secure a political end , '' even `` the unity of God and his claim to the title of Prophet . ''

		On a fairer inter - pretation , the instances which Dr.
Margoli	PERSON	- outh probably has in mind do not bear out this charge , and may even be cited as evi - dences of Mohammed 's sincerity .

		Unfortu - nately , we know much less of the `` warner '' of Mecca than of the civil and religious ruler 582 THE DIAL of
Medina	LOCATION	; but what we know does not war - rant our questioning a genuine spiritual experience and high moral aims in the earlier period , however we may regret the many errors of his later life .

		Without a recogni - tion of this the religion he founded can not be understood .

		Dr.
Margoliouth	PERSON	's conception of the Harranians is noteworthy , if not altogether free from objections .

		Dr.
Weir	PERSON	's reference to the `` Christian Sabians '' -LRB- Moham - medanism -RRB- is inexplicable .

		Dr.
Farnell	PERSON	's description of
Greek Religion	ORGANIZATION	is a model of its kind .

		As regards Logos , Dr.
Inge	PERSON	's statement that `` the authors of the Septuagint use it to trans - late the Hebrew Memra '' is wrong and mis - leading ; the Memra of the Aramaic Targums is not found in the
Hebrew Bible	LOCATION	, and the Greek version does not show the slightest trace of the Logos speculation .

		Dr.
Gilbert	PERSON	thinks that the importance of the Kingdom of God in the thought of Jesus can be gauged by the comparatively rare occurrence of the term in the so-called
Logia	LOCATION	or Q , where it is found only eight times against seventeen in
Matthew	LOCATION	.

		Can the nai 've faith in a purely hypothetical document , made in
Germany	LOCATION	the other day , go further than this ?

		Discoursing on the important topic of Immortality , Dr.
Mellone	PERSON	leaves out as irrelevant the inquiry as to the origin and development of the idea , steers clear of spirit-rappings as well as resurrec - tions , does not trouble himself about the souls of Pithecanthropus erectus , his ancestors , or his descendants in the embryonic state , rejects conditional immortality , is not satisfied with posthumous influence , ignores hell , and declares in favor of an eternal developing and perfecting of every human personality .

		Typographical errors are extremely rare in these new volumes .

		`` Xousares '' should be `` Dousares '' -LRB- Vol .

		VI. , p. 421 -RRB- ; the
Mandaic	PERSON	word for
Sunday	DATE	is correctly given in Syriac letters , but wrongly transliterated -LRB- Vol .

		VIII. , p. 389 -RRB- .

		In the case of `` Jahillya '' for `` Jahiliya , '' the worst is not the spelling ; Fallaize has misunderstood
Robertson Smith	PERSON	's translation of a passage from the Kitab al Aghani .

		`` Jahiliya '' is not a place-name , it means `` ignorance , '' and refers to the period before Mohammed .

		The
Mohammedan	DATE	era still continues to be employed in various arti - cles , often without reduction of the dates ; writers on Roman history have ceased dating events ab urbe condita .

		It is to be hoped that a general index to the complete work will be added , like that in '' The Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' as there is no ade - quate system of cross-references .

		A somewhat careful reading of these seven volumes , each of which contains about a mil - lion words , has left upon the mind of the reviewer two strong impressions .

		It is a treasury of well sifted information for which every student must be grateful .

		In it
Chris	PERSON	- tianity is presented side by side with the other religions , and religion is placed in its larger social setting .

		On the other hand , the apolo - getic manner in which topics related to Christianity are treated contrasts painfully with the scientific spirit characteristic of practically all other departments of the great wor '

		AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY GALLANT .

		* In rewarming the old fires of an eighteenth century romance Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	has contrived to avoid that archness of manner which ladies who re-edit court memoirs so generally assume .

		There is not a snigger in the volume .

		This , in itself , is an achievement .

		Indeed she describes the celebrated affair of the
Cheva	LOCATION	- lier de Boufflers and the
Comtesse de Sabran	ORGANIZATION	with sympathy , dignity , and perhaps a certain solemnity .

		With no gusto whatever for scandalous anecdote , she explains patiently to her not too erudite readers conditions in the French court which must strike them as strangely different from the home life of the late Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		Her book makes no claims as to original research or historical discovery .

		Rather it is a compilation from various sources of much that pertains to the famous
Chevalier de Boufflers	ORGANIZATION	and his grande passion , arranged in a coherent and readable fashion so that even the most insular Briton derives from its perusal a more sympathetic understanding of the men and women of the times of
Louis Sixteenth	LOCATION	and the French Revolution .

		Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	is less successful in attempt - ing to paint the highly colored background of the period than in her delineation of the two principal characters .

		The
Chevalier de Boufflers	ORGANIZATION	and the
Comtesse de Sabran	ORGANIZATION	are made real to us through the medium of their own correspondence , an extraordinary corre - spondence covering many years and all the emotions of humanity , ranging from the light - est gossip and airiest philosophy to tumul - tuous outpourings and passionate reproaches , singularly human , wholly free from the pedantry or artificiality one sometimes expects in eighteenth century letters .

		Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	has been wise to quote copiously from their letters .

		On the other hand , her translations are not always happy and one wishes that she had appended the originals more consistently .

		It is not easy to render in English the grace of de
Boufflers	ORGANIZATION	's : `` Les vrais plaisirs n'ont pas d ` age : ils ressemblent aux anges , qui sont des enfants eternels '' ; or the
Comtesse	ORGANIZATION	's : `` Ce qu'il y a de plus a desirer , c'est d'etre bien trompe jusqu'a son dernier jour . ''

		One wishes , too , that more of the delightful and often improper songs of the
Chevalier	PERSON	had been included in this book , songs which , as
Chamfort	PERSON	said to him , Sont cites par toute la
France	LOCATION	; On salt par cour ces riens charmants Que tu produis avec aisanee .

		He inherited this gift of easy , graceful versification from his mother , the delightful
Madame de Boufflers	ORGANIZATION	, who ruled the easy court at
Luneville	LOCATION	.

		She was a charming lady , as famous for her wit as her inconstancy , and her son may have learned from her the art of conversation , as well as of versifying .

		II faut dire en deux mots Ce qu'on veut dire ; Les longs propos Sont sots .

		The brilliant and worldly son of a brilliant and worldly mother , de Boufflers was destined for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		While at the seminary , he delighted the fashionable world with the pub - lication of ``
Aline	PERSON	, Heine de Golconde , '' a story which had an extraordinary vogue at the time , and which resulted in his giving up the career of an abbe , an event which he cel - ebrated in the following lines : J'ai quitte ma soutane Malgre tous mes parents ; Je veux que Dieu me damne Si jamais je la prends .

		Eh !

		rnais oui da , Comment peut-on trouver du mal a caf Eh !

		mais oui da , Se fera pretre qui voudra .

		Henceforward he wandered through
Europe	LOCATION	, a poet , an artist , adored by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and man -RCB- - ladies , a soldier and a courtier .

		He was of a curiously frank turn , and indeed was little suited to diplomacy or the obse - quious knee-service of the court .

		He once wrote : `` II n ' y a que Dieu qui ait un assez grand fonds de gaiete pour ne pas s ` ennuyer de tous les hommages qu'on lui rend . ''

		He was , however , one of the most popular men of his time ; his extraordinary wit and gaiety , his originality and charm made him in demand everywhere , while his natural good taste never let him become merely the buffoon .

		Famous for his gallantries , he was in no sense a cold voluptuary or a cynical seducteur .

		The
Prince de Ligne	ORGANIZATION	said of him that the foundation of his character was `` une ~ bonte sans mesure , '' and perhaps so many ladies loved him for the simple reason that he was very lovable .

		With all his intellectual power , personal charm , and position at court , de Boufflers never achieved high place or per - manent accomplishment .

		He was indeed Governor of
Senegal	LOCATION	, where he worked nobly for the amelioration of the lot of the wretched natives , slaves and free , and he was prominent as G member of the States-General which ush - ered in the Revolution where he labored with enthusiasm and devotion , to no effect whatever .

		To most people the central fact of his life was his long love affair with the
Comtesse de Sabran	ORGANIZATION	.

		When he met her first she was the young widow of the old , heroic Comte de Sabran , famous for many gallant exploits , the best known of which was his glorious fight of the `` Centaure '' against four English men of war , a fight of seven hours duration , which was only concluded when `` with broken masts and torn sails , and with eleven bullet-wounds in his own body , his ammunition exhausted , and the last cannon charged with his silver plate , '' he struck his flag .

		At sixty-nine the old sailor married
Eleonore de Jean	PERSON	, a girl of nineteen , a girl so candid , innocent , and lovely that the cynical court of Louis XV .

		delighted to honor her with the title of `` Fleur , des Champs . ''

		After the death of the old
Comte de Sabran	ORGANIZATION	, the young widow , one of the great ladies of
France	LOCATION	, was courted by many , but her one lover was de Boufflers .

		In spite of his inconstancy and inconsistency , she never wavered in her devotion , and in his fashion he loved her very truly .

		Lovers for almost twenty years , they were not mar - ried until , in the wreckage of the Revolution , the scruples which prevented the penniless
Chevalier	PERSON	from taking such a step were washed away , and in their old age their troubled , passionate careers subsided sweetly and happily into love in a cottage .

		Their lives covered the reigns of two kings , the French Revolution , the Directory , and the - age of Napoleon .

		Their letters express the reactions of those vivid days on intense , sin - cere , and brilliant minds .

		Their lives are well worth study .

		Mrs.
Webster	PERSON	is to be thanked for presenting them for the first time to English readers in such a thorough i and sympathetic way .


RICHARD E. DANIELSON	PERSON	.

		584 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	THE IS `` EW SPIRIT .

		* Professor
Perry	PERSON	has written a book of essays which looks squarely toward the future , and the best of them are the ones in which he explains why as an independent civilian and a thoughtful American he has become a convert to the doctrine of universal service .

		Three years ago such a book as this was not in evidence ; our thinking has become quickened since then .

		`` Ordeal by Battle , '' a stirring volume by Mr.
F. S. Oliver	PERSON	, the disciple and friend of Lord
Roberts	PERSON	, served as spur to many .

		But this vigorous and uncompromising appeal somehow seemed too completely based on one particular factor that of German aggressiveness and too fatal - istic in its conception of an eternity of Spartan preparedness against the danger of once more being thus caught unawares .

		Pro- fessor
Perry	PERSON	is more moderate .

		His imme - diate impetus to write seems to have come from his attendance at one of the first
Platts	PERSON	- burg training camps .

		The spirit of the camps , the utter weariness of marching and fighting under pack followed by glorious moments of unrestrained repose , the subjec - tion of unessential idiosyncrasies to a common purpose , the daily dedication of the work , its drudgery as well as its interest , in the salute to the flag at retreat , all this he has suc - ceeded in expressing simply and with real penetration in an essay modestly entitled `` The Impressions of a
Plattsburg	LOCATION	Recruit . ''

		And in the main his argument is the one that is current there : `` the right to vote implies the duty to serve , '' - - an opinion which is probably concurred in no more heartily by the
Plattsburg	LOCATION	`` rookies , '' who enjoy their service , than by the Mexican militiamen who do n ' t enjoy theirs .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	is a firm believer in the right to call upon all available force in the defence of national as well as individual ideals .

		He who takes up arms must enter the service of peace .

		This is not a mere paradox or the echo of a prevailing sentiment , but honest downright morals .

		Universalism must take precedence of nationalism on the same ground that entitles nationalism to take precedence of individualism .

		Nationalism is a higher principle of action than individualism by all the other individuals of whom it takes account .

		A nation is not a mystical entity other than you and me , but it is more than you or me inasmuch as it is both of us and still more besides .

		Similarly , humanity is more than nationality , not because it is different , but because it is bigger and more per - manent .

		And the solution for any national aggres - sive tendencies connected with national arm - ament he finds in `` The Tolerance of Nations / ' which is akin to the tolerance of religions : `` Peace itself has to be redeemed , and that which alone will save it will be an eager championship of differing national ideals , a generous rivalry in well-doing , the athlete 's love of a strong opponent , and the positive relish for diverse equality . ''

		There is a refreshing absence of `` America First '' in his advocacy of the whole proposal .

		But what makes one doubtful of Professor
Perry	PERSON	's universalism is his handy assumption that nations have a unity like that of individ - uals .

		They tend to acquire one in time of war , and they will tend to remain so possessed after war .

		But to agree upon the existence of a national culture , whether legitimate and respectful of the rights of others or not , and to classify and limit the individual 's activities by his relation to that culture , smacks of the mediaeval church 's dealings with science .

		This war provides an instance : the `` Pac - ifists '' who oppose it in
Germany	LOCATION	are applauded here ; the lukewarm or critical `` Pacifists '' in
England	LOCATION	are condemned .

		And yet the attitude and motives of
Ramsey Macdonald	ORGANIZATION	and Dr.
Liebknecht	PERSON	are probably as nearly alike as those of any two human beings .

		A situation which develops such a paradox can not be the solution of the national-inter - national problem .

		Peace must come from within the individual , from the encourage - ment of his willingness to play fair and at the same time to esteem whatever is best in another 's nation .

		Such an attitude is not opposed to caution , but it is a shift from the suspicion-basis of modern statecraft .

		It rec - ognizes the necessity of giving the fullest decision to untrammelled individual opinion as the only antidote to the oft repeated phe - nomenon of a national stampede .

		And for this , despite his insistence upon the impor - tance of educating the freeman-soldier , Pro- fessor
Perry	PERSON	's `` reconciliation of liberty and discipline '' must prove inadequate .

		For , as he says : If a man 's conscience is offended , so much the worse for his conscience .

		What he needs is a new conscience which will teach him to keep the faith with his fellows until such time as their common understanding and their controlling policy shall have been modified .

		The man who refuses to obey the law or play the game because he has been outvoted is more likely to be afflicted with peevishness or egotism than exalted by heroism .

		It would be unfair to believe that Professor
Perry	PERSON	's inspiring experiences at
Plattsburg	LOCATION	have influenced his philosophic plea .

		But
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 585 perhaps the elan of such voluntary service may have caused him to forget that much of its peculiar sanctity would be lost if it were to become a matter of compulsory routine in every man 's life , simply a certificate of his physical fitness .

		There is no call for gilding over an additional burden by dwelling on its incidental advantages .

		Universal service may be a military necessity ; if it is , let us have it with as little delay and friction as possible .

		But we should adopt it on that ground alone .

		There is no reason for yielding to our instinct , a guileless offshoot of Puritanism , and once more making a necessity out of what is now at any rate something of a virtue .

		* So far as it goes , Professor
Groat	PERSON	's `` Intro - duction to the
Study of Organized Labor	ORGANIZATION	in

		But there will lurk in the reader 's mind a suspicion that the time and material have to a large extent been wasted , not on account of failure to accomplish the task set , but because of the nature of the task itself .

		No one deprecates more than the reviewer the ostentatious display of bibliographical apparatus , customary in books of this kind .

		Professor
Groat	PERSON	decided to keep his pages free from the interruptions of references , although in `` cases where the authorities could be definitely stated , they are named in the body of the text . '

		- This is unobjectionable , the author says , for the reasons that the material is not so new that critics will wish to verify it , and the sources are so widely scattered as not to be readily available .

		The validity of both these reasons may be doubted , and the result will not be entirely satisfactory either to the general reader or to the student who has not the assistance of an instructor 's lec - tures ; for general statements are made con - cerning many important matters , and if the sources are mentioned it is with an ofttimes apparently nonchalant indifference to chapter and verse .

		It follows that those interested and Professor

Groat	PERSON	's discussion .

		He first furnishes a slight background for the modern organiza - tions by considering wage theories and the development of industrial conditions .

		After a survey of the structure of the unions and their government , he passes to the problem of collective bargaining , and then takes up the strike , arbitration , the boycott , the closed shop , and trade agreements .

		Separate sec - tions deal with the political activities of unions and revolutionary industrialism .

		All this is preeminently descriptive , and so completely and accurately done that the volume will probably supplant previous ones in text-book availability and value for the general reader .

		The material it contains is more than that necessary for a mere intro - duction ; and the treatment , while clear and concise , is by no means elementary .

		Natur - ally enough , the author is a believer in union - ism , and approves many of the union methods and demands in the struggle with capital ; but his bias is nowhere pronounced , and both sides of the questions are always presented .

		But as an interpretative piece of work the book is a failure , and this is the second reason why , in the opinion of the reviewer , the time and material have perhaps been wasted .

		Possibly Professor
Groat	PERSON	's purpose was simply to describe the fairly obvious ; yet there are some fundamental questions which must be answered before the labor movement can be understood .

		What is the economic and ethical philosophy of the trade unionist ?

		What code of ethics can sanction , for example , the insistence of the railway brotherhoods that their demands be met , with their programme of a national strike as the alternative ?

		Is it right , furthermore , for innocent employers to be injured by a sym - pathetic strike to enforce the claims of union - ists whose employers are not innocent ?

		And there are many questions of a similar nature which arise in a discussion of such revolu - tionary movements as syndicalism and sabot - age .

		The treatment of these questions is of the briefest .

		By this criticism it is not meant that a single author can within the limits of an `` Introduction '' give full discussions of 586 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	these ethical problems ; but it does not seem too much to ask that the problems be indicated and a few of the varying views set forth , so that the reader may know by what norms , if any , the successful struggle of the labor class may be justified .

		KECENT FICTION .

		* American writers have always done well with short-stories .

		Irving ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	wrote famous short-stories at a time when few in our country were successful in their effort to write long ones , and since then the short-story has been one of the established forms of fiction .

		It is certainly one of the most popular forms , if we may judge from the great number of periodicals which seem to depend mainly on the magnet of brief fiction .

		Supplying the demand has become a trade which anyone can learn , according to the advertisements of the trade schools of the craft .

		Not many of the innumerable short - stories written , however , are preserved to posterity , indeed few ever appear in the solid form of the bound volume .

		There is no com - parison between the number of novels pub - lished and the number of collections of short-stories .

		Publishers are likely to decline the latter without thanks .

		People hesitate before picking up a collection unless it is by somebody well known .

		There seems to be a feeling that they are well enough in magazines or newspapers , but that they are rather ephemeral .

		Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	some time ago said , `` Here is a form of literature easy to write and easy to read . ''

		However it may be with the writing of really good short-stories , it is generally easier to read a short story than a part of a long one , which is probably the reason for the great number of story - magazines .

		In spite of all this , there are still many fine short-stories , and great reputations have been founded on them .

		Kipling and
Conan Doyle	PERSON	would stand much where they stand now had they never written novels .

		The talent of 0 .

		Henry found ample scope in the briefer form , and the great reputation of the late
Jack London	PERSON	was made chiefly by his short - stories .

		Most of our writers of fiction at the present day , however , are best known by their novels .

		Such is the case with Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		SHORT STORIES FROM LIFE .

		With an Introduction by
Thomas L. Masson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		if we have in mind
Henry James	PERSON	and Guy de Maupassant , who were , I suppose , the chief influences of the nineties in the particular form of art which interested her , she often puts her impressions of life into short-stories or even sketches of character .

		But she is at her best in her novels .

		She has the grasp of fact and the power of imagination and the sense of art that sometimes contrive to make the reading of a novel a memorable expe - rience .

		We have in `` Xingu '' a number of stories which were mostly written , it would seem , before her work in
France	LOCATION	; at least they show little effect of what has been a remark - able period in her life .

		Two of the stories one of them the best of the collection are French in subject , but the others are views of the world which Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's readers already know .

		Situations in the individual life , developments or contrasts of character , ironic phases , are recounted in a slow natural way , with all the implications and suggestions of life itself .

		`` Xingu , '' the story that gives its name to the collection , is a lighter bit and very amusing , though on a subject hardly worth Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's attention .

		The false culture of the ladies ' library club is to our generation one of the conventional sources of humor , somewhat as the goat who ate tomato - cans and the man who put up stove-pipes used to be in the last generation .

		There are undoubtedly women who run after literary notabilities , who carry around volumes of `` Appropriate Allusions , '' who quote literary opinions or catchwords without much idea of their meaning , who really care more for social amusement than for literature ; but even if there are , it seems hardly worth while to say so again unless one says it exceedingly well .

		Aside from this -LRB- somewhat priggish -RRB- consid - eration , `` Xingu '' is certainly most amusing .

		The best in the collection , however , is `` Com - ing Home , '' a story of the war where Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	uses her skill in something she clearly thought -LRB- and rightly -RRB- well worth doing .

		`` Short Stories from Life '' comes in con - veniently for one who is interested in getting an idea of what short-story writers nowadays are trying to do .

		If our other collection offered fair examples of literature , this col - lection might show the general run of the short-story as it appears in the periodical of to-day .

		It does not do exactly that because the stories in the collection are all pretty short .

		`` Life , '' it appears , was interested in knowing how short a story could be , and therefore opened a competition with terms which should encourage the extreme of brevity .

		This was managed by the ingenious
1916	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 587 device of paying for the stories that were pub - lished at the rate of
ten cents	MONEY	for every word less than fifteen hundred paying , one might say , for what was left out instead of for what was there .

		That , of course , set a standard of extreme shortness ; none of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's stories would have brought a cent in the competition .

		It would be hard to say offhand just how good or bad these stories are .

		To read the book through is like trying - to dine on nine cocktails , eighteen hors d'aeuvres , eighteen pieces of cheese , eighteen liqueurs , nine demi - tasses , and nine cigarettes , making eighty-one courses in all , which is too long even for a Chinese banquet .

		Or if not too long , it is long enough to spoil any delicacy of taste .

		It would take eighty-one hours to criticize it fairly .

		Fortunately the Introduction by the managing editor of `` Life '' suggests some sort of criterion .

		Mr.
Masson	PERSON	says that `` a short - story must be a picture out of real life which gives the reader a definite sensation . ''

		One may doubt this very seriously ; many good stories are really stories and not pictures at all .

		In writing of the technique of the short - story , however , Mr.
Masson	PERSON	says that its wprds should not suggest `` the fatal thought that the author is dependent upon others for his phrasing .

		When , for example , we read ` With a glad cry she threw her arms about him ' ' A hoarse shout went up from the vast throng ' ` He flicked the ashes , ' we know at once that the author is dealing only in echoes . ''

		This is interesting , partly because one of these test - phrases occurs -LRB- in a slightly different form , `` flicking the ash '' -RRB- in the story which gained the second prize .

		It would be a foolish attempt at smartness to ask what must be the case with the others when the next to the best was at fault in so fatal a manner .

		Perhaps one would not agree that the test-phrases are perfectly reliable .

		Whether they are or not , the general idea is of course right , as well as that about the short-story coming out of real life .

		We feel that originality of seeing and writing is more likely to result in something good than the use of old , even well-tried material ; we want something that a man sees for himself and tells for himself , not some - thing that is but an echo of what may be read better elsewhere .

		These stories from `` Life '' do not stand that test so well as Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's .

		I must confess that the story about the ladies ' club talking about Xingu has some echoes in it , but in the main Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is interested in things she has observed for herself , or heard of , in the great procession of life as it goes by .

		The authors of the stories from `` I ^ ife '' often tell us of matters which I do not believe came direct from real life .

		Take the story which gained the first prize .

		It is the tale of a German commander of a submarine engaged to an American girl , who , after he has been highly praised for sinking a great ocean liner , finds that his fiancee was on board .

		Possibly that is a `` picture out of real life '' ; it may not be `` dealing in echoes '' ; but I have my doubts .

		It seems to me rather a case con - structed to illustrate the somewhat common - place idea of a certain irony in life or a cer - tain poetic justice or something of the sort .

		Many of the tales are more like the real thing .

		The story which seems to me to smack most of real life is one called `` The Old Grove Crossing , '' in which a judge on the bench and a leader of the bar amuse themselves in court one day in rivalry in a conventional piece of sentimental rhodomontade .

		One good thing about the story is that the author austerely hides from us the fact -LRB- if it be one -RRB- that they both knew the whole thing was conventional .

		That seems very like life indeed ; perhaps they thought they were genuine , perhaps not .

		Who can say ?

		I presume I have rather a prejudiced view on this question because I sent a story to this competition which really was a transcript of a piece of life I found in a seventeenth century town-record .

		Perhaps -LRB- beside being poor in other ways -RRB- , it did not seem to the judges to be a picture out of real life , although it was .

		If it had echoes in it -LRB- and it certainly did -RRB- , they were echoes of the record .

		The fact is that we do not always recognize real life when we see it .

		These stories offer one a good opportunity for amusement in testing the matter .

		Is Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	really like life ?

		Are the seventy - two authors of the eighty-one stories ?

		If one can answer that question , one will have a test that will enable one to enjoy much and reject more in the fiction of our day .

		It is safe to say that nobody who has read Booth Tarkington 's `` Seventeen '' ' will ever quite dare to be seventeen again .

		But `` Penrod and
Sam	PERSON	, '' its successor , though quite as jolly , has exactly the contrary effect of making the reader long for a return of the conscienceless , adventurous age of ten .

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	is a master of the small boy 's language and temperament ; he understands his longings and his disgusts and his temporary ambitions ; he has the rare power of reduplicating intonation in print , which is half the outfit of any humorist .

		When
Penrod	ORGANIZATION	is deepest-dyed in inward guilt , then is he most righteous in his own defence .

		-LRB- The last monosyllable , it must be explained , was drawn from private pro- nunciation of journalistic headlines . -RRB-

		The fact that sompthing happened to be the `` good ole snake '' calculated to wreak havoc below-stairs , had of course nothing to do with the case of injured innocence .

		Mr.

		For a charming , unexciting , but realistic story of ante-bellum aristocracy in
Paris	LOCATION	and the
Midi	LOCATION	, ``
Helen	PERSON	, '' by
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, will prove thoroughly acceptable .

		One must not expect to be entertained by the lurid and gaudy Parisian `` society '' of much modern fiction fiction indeed !

		but one may meet here the older , more truly French aristocracy of birth and breeding , whose elderly survivors do not disdain the rive gauche , nor yet the rue du Bac , and whose younger off - shoot have approached the
Etoile	LOCATION	.

		These people live quietly , unassumingly ; but their lives are rich in associations , in friendships , in all that really counts .

		It is a circle in which the grand - mother is more honored than the debutante .

		More particularly , this story concerns a brother and sister of half - American birth , and wholly European breeding , who are suddenly transplanted from the exile of a
Riviera	LOCATION	villa to this ripening
Paris	LOCATION	atmosphere of which we were speaking .

		Helen 's poise when thus confronted by the `` world '' is unshaken , but she retains the originality of thought and of will to do the unconventional .

		Her gradual adaption to life is the ultimate theme of the story .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is a writer who knows his setting with a rare completeness ; he is rare in one other respect that he is not unwilling to spend time and care on his work .

		But his people are not quite flesh and blood ; they are seen but dimly , like figures behind ground glass .

Beulah Marie Dix	ORGANIZATION	has done so much toward re-creating the atmosphere of Puritan days that perhaps one should not demand variety as well as verisimilitude in her work .

		Certain it is that her new story , ``
Blithe McBride	PERSON	, '' is much of a piece with her previous tales from `` Soldier Rigdale '' on .

		Its heroine is a child brought up among the thieves of
Crocker	PERSON	's Lane ,
London	LOCATION	, who escapes to the `` plantations , '' hoping as a bond - servant there to lead at least a decent , honest life .

		But she falls into the hands of some godly folk from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, who introduce her to a new life that brings something of both good and ill and a great deal of that all-essential element in the life of any veritable heroine of fiction adventure .

		This includes , of necessity , some time spent as a captive with the `` tawnies . ''

		`` Blithe McBride '' is a story for children in their teens or for grownups who have not lost their appreciation of the simple and the sentimental in story-telling .

		Long ago , when the `` Strand '' was bringing out `` The Hound of the Baskervilles '' and one was put upon a very uncertain sense of honor not to read thereof , second only to the stolen charms of that masterpiece were the delights of
E. Nesbit	ORGANIZATION	's chil - dren 's stories , which were printed a few pages beyond .

		A new novel from her pen , `` The Incred - ible Honeymoon , '' shows that she has lost none of her gift for story-telling , nor the singular power to make improbable things seem real .

		Thus when her hero
Edward Basingstoke	ORGANIZATION	buys a bulldog named
Charles	PERSON	, sets forth to see
England	LOCATION	on foot and , falling over a garden wall , meets and elopes with its unhappy proprietress , one accepts the facts just as one accepted all the author 's delight - ful statements in more credulous days and one enjoys the story to the top of one 's bent .

		Edward and
Katharine	PERSON	and
Charles	PERSON	after a mock mar - riage held to satisfy a trio of pursuing aunts , set forth to seek adventures throughout the length and breadth of
England	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately they seek it in the well-travelled parts , thus allying the book somewhat too closely with the
Williamson	PERSON	type of guidebook novel .

		But all the same one may enjoy the story for itself , as a well-written , unpreten - tious , and most readable tale .

		Some dozen dusty long-forgotten objects in a dusty all-but-forgotten museum of
Naples	LOCATION	inspired the same number of stories by
Marjorie Bowen	PERSON	, an historical romancer of no slight experience .

		In her `` Shadows of Yesterday '' she recounts adven - tures in seventeenth and eighteenth century
Italy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, using her material with a fair degree of skill and of knowledge of the times .

		Her sub - jects are apt to be a bit gloomy , dealing with degeneracy , sudden death , and love unrequited ; but she can be moving as well as startling , as her `` Petronilla '' proves ; and she does at times show a strain of grim humor as in `` The Town Lady , '' which even at its grimmest is relatively mirth - provoking .

		It is amusing , if one is of an inquir - ing turn , to translate these tales of lust and murder into modern terms ; the process will serve to remind the reader of the relative availability of the period for the production of sensational fic - tion .

		Not that
Miss Bowen	PERSON	is not within her rights .

		Far be it from us to assert that she had not just ground for her fancies ; the
Visconti	PERSON	and their kind were undoubtedly somewhat further removed from civilized standards of conduct than shall we say , a certain more northern suc - cessor in vandalism ?

		But time exaggerates , in the same degree that distance enchants ; and from the material of yesterday as well as from that of to-day , one may choose .

		Miss
Bowen	PERSON	has chosen the side that appealed to her , and she has presented it , admittedly , remarkably well .

		A moral current sweeps him through many varie - ties of wild and bitter experience , to a haven foreordained .

		This hero has a talent for every - thing he takes up , without any well-defined bent .

		He is golden-haired , he is athletic , he is affable , he is the soul of honor .

		But with all this he remains pleasantly diffused , like a real person - ality .

		It is only a rhetorical question to introduce his answer in the latest addition to `` Our National Problems . ''

		The substance of his answer has already appeared in the `` Outlook , '' and the recast material exhibits becoming restraint , except where he has to express bis opinion of the Wilson-Bryan policy .

		He seems biassed in favor of the
Gringo	LOCATION	, not to mention the promoter , rather than against the native , but his vigorous championship of the former often betrays him into an unsympathetic attitude .

		He attempts a brief historical introduc - tion that is neither clear nor accurate .

		According to his analysis ,
Mexico	LOCATION	suffers principally from the revolutionary habit ; but this , he points out , is individual rather than popular in impulse .

		The great bulk of the people are placidly disposed but irresolute , easily led , and attracted by momentary trifles .

		This is only what we should expect of a conglomerate mass of people , sixty per cent of whom are of native descent , and half as many more of mixed blood .

		One may question the accuracy of his figures without doubting their essential truth , and note with satisfaction that among the more cultured upper tenth he does recognize a `` few high-minded , loyal Mexicans . ''

		He would initiate improvement by the establish - ment of a firm government , and follow this by an honest and just policy toward the lower classes .

		No one will quarrel with this as a general principle , but Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	evidently would judge indul - gently any form of government that promised reasonable stability .

		Therefore he would strip revolt of all high-flown phrases , disregard all pre - tense in favor of agrarian or political rights , and depend upon the slow processes of education to effect any essential improvement in general condi - tions .

		Once more he may be right in his main purpose , but he does not indicate how this is to be accomplished with a high-spirited , sensitive people .

		For this reason his chapters recounting the effects wrought in
Mexico	LOCATION	by the foreigner are more convincing .

		Of those effects up to
1910	DATE	and of the subsequent ruin wrought by revolution , we are reasonably certain , and he gives brief sketches of many who figured in both movements .

		But he does not clearly show us the way out of the present welter of blood and pillage ; nor does he convince us that the policy of the present administration has been wholly injudicious .

		Mr.

Isadora Duncan	PERSON	: `` She is a seer and a prophet , fulfilled of under - standing and wisdom .

		The deep disease of the soul , its wasting , anemic illness since it ate of the weeds of prudery and went wandering on the hard roads of materialism , is known to her , and she has a great pity ; and with devoted effort , through consecrating trials of toil and rejection , she has fitted herself to be a physician of the spirit .

		Here Mr.
Genthe	PERSON	has given us ninety or more exquisite f photographs , some in colors , which record , as he puts it , `` something of the fugitive charm of rhythmic motion , significant gesture , and brilliant color which the dance has once more brought into our lives . ''

		`` The Book of the Dance '' is much more than a thing of aesthetic beauty : it contains a gospel for strug - gling , cramped , inarticulate souls who long for freedom and expression .

		Many have already found the means of losing self in the infinite through rhythmic motion to music .

		It was to be expected that a professed Socialist would select a subject along the line of his chief interest ; but in carrying out his plan the author has carefully avoided all controversial matters and has given a series of discussions that are sym - pathetic as well as critical .

		Professor
Jackson	PERSON	draws his information largely from literary sources , each lecture being based on some impor - tant literary work or series of works .

		He views the eighteenth century through the Journals of
Wesley	PERSON	and the poems of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The early nineteenth is seen through
Cobbold	ORGANIZATION	's novel ``
Margaret Catchpole	PERSON	'' and the `` Creevy Papers . ''

		The early Victorian period is described from the writings of
Dickens	LOCATION	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		Gunning 's `` Reminiscences of
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' is used to illus - trate English university life , and the novels of
Surtees	PERSON	and Trollope serve the same purpose for sport and rural life .

		The lectures are highly interesting and make delightful reading ; but they are somewhat uneven in quality and the main pur - pose of the series seems to be lost sight of at times .

		Perhaps the most satisfactory is the lec - ture on
Wesley	PERSON	and his age , in which the author succeeds in sketching both the great preacher and his environment .

		The lectures on
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	and ``
Margaret Catchpole	PERSON	'' are not so well done ; the literary background is traced with some care , but the description of
Suffolk	LOCATION	life leaves a rather blurred impression .

		The account of the matri - monial tangle of George IV .

		seems hardly worth while , but the lectures on social abuses in the days of
Dickens	PERSON	and the struggle of
Becky Sharp	PERSON	and her class for social recognition are very suggestive and enlightening .

		It is a strange society that Professor
Jackson	PERSON	depicts : it was narrow , self - satisfied , and wanting in refinement ; it had many unlovely traits , but it was also strong and resource - ful , for it produced a series of social movements that have revolutionized English life .

		And in discussing the changes that have come over both country and town , the author does not fail to point out that there was much that was good and delightful in the English past .

		And yet there is perhaps some happiness for this old gentleman in his few declining years , for he blithely says : `` I return back -LSB- note the happy use of the expressive word `` back `` j to my old home city , back to its joy of old friends and to the delight of its happier , more genuine life and living .

		In
New York	LOCATION	, wolfish and relentless , `` girlish innocence and sweetness '' are quickly replaced by `` a hardness that only one other kind of experience that I know of will set on the coun - tenance of a young girl . ''

		Which is only in line with the blunt saying that `` theatrical Broadway knows chastity only to prey upon it if it can . ''

		It is deplorable , of course , that the producing managers demand `` good looks , good figure , good proportions and that mysterious , indefinable some - thing that is called ` personality ' '' indeed that they prefer these things to `` intelligence and mental training '' ; but managers will be managers .

		And
New York	LOCATION	is no worse than the rest of the country , one surmises .

England	LOCATION	, or
Europe	LOCATION	, for that matter .

		Favoritism , corruption , commercial - ism , `` star-dom , '' syndicates , the philosophy of giving the public something much lower than they will patronize and pretending to give just `` what the public wants , '' there is a remedy for these things , for
America	LOCATION	; and that is the problem which our modest author shirks .

		When our dramatists measure up to European standards of excellence ; when our public declines to accept , without protest , what it is offered in the theatre , there will be no excuse for anonymous confessions .

		1916 -RSB- THE DIAL 591 New needs are continually calling The science of .

		, .

		, , J , , advertising .

		m < x -RRB- existence new orders ot books , `` lest one good order should corrupt the world . ''

		The business of advertising has recently been illuminated by the publication of several careful psychological studies , the most recent of which , `` Advertising and Its Mental Laws , '' by
Henry Foster Adams	PERSON	, instructor in psychology in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , summarizes much of value in the others and adds a great deal of new material , the result largely of extensive laboratory investiga - tions among students .

		The book teems with infor - mation and practical suggestions for the scientific advertiser , while at the same time it has its attrac - tion for the psychologist on account of the thor - oughly sound method revealed in almost all the investigation .

		The effects of advertising in reduc - ing the selling cost , the volume of advertising in the country , the discussion of the relative value of mediums , the citation from
W. D. Scott	PERSON	's `` Advertising and Selling '' with reference to the relative merits of `` Standard '' magazines or `` Flats , '' and especially those parts of the chapters on
Association	ORGANIZATION	and Fusions -LRB- the author 's original contribution -RRB- which handle so adequately the com - plex and important questions of strategic position on the page and size and frequency of advertise - ment , all these will advance the science of the subject .

		On the other hand , the admirable exposi - tion of statistical method and the chapters on Attention and Memory , as well as the data con - cerning sex-differences in so many kinds of reac - tions , will prove good study for the psychologist .

		Of course many of the conclusions , which , to do the author justice , he does not regard as very conclusive , are open to the common objection to laboratory experiments .

		The chapter on Statis - tical Method does not recognize the fact that cer - tain commodities are essentially more attractive than other commodities , and that students have preferences irrespective of the attractiveness or scientific placing of advertisements , which might change in an inscrutable way the results obtained .

		Those of us who read '' The
Hibbert	PERSON	Mr.
Jack	PERSON	's T , , .

		, , .

		^ .

		- r new volume .

		Journal because its editor is Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	will need to add to our library shelves his latest collection of short stories , `` Philosophers in Trouble '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The public at large will not be interested in the book , and need not be .

		One must already be addicted to Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	's work to care for these stories .

		Two of them are printed for the first time : the other four are from `` Cornhill , '' `` Blackwood 's , '' `` The Hibbert Journal , '' and `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' and are ephemera admirable as periodical liter - ature but hardly worth gathering into a book .

		For after the subtle artistry and out-of-doors manhood one felt in every line of `` Mad Shepherds , '' `` Phil - osophers in Trouble '' is disappointing .

		The `` trouble '' into which the various philosophers fall arises always from the conflict between thought and conduct , between school theories and practical actions .

		Camelius in the story called `` Not Con - vincing '' ; the psychologist among the Saints who tries a variety of religious experiences with hand on wrist and eye on the clock ; the casuists who allow
Count Zeppelin	ORGANIZATION	, fallen from one of his airships , to drown in a British duck-pond rather than sacrifice principle and rescue him ; all are engaged in the diverting pastime of squaring the human circle , in other words , reconciling dogmas with deeds .

		But the characters - speak only their parts , and the author-manager rather rudely thrusts them through their allotted lines and off stage , so that the philosophical problems which they solve seem less significant than if faced by real men and women .

		The eternal Under the title , `` French Perspec - heartof tives '' -LRB-
Houghton Mififlin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Miss Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant	ORGANIZATION	has collected a dozen ^ essays which reveal an intimate acquaintance with
France	LOCATION	such as has been granted to few Americans .

		She makes her debut as an inmate of a cosmopolitan sanitarium , which , she broadly bints , is about as much the real
France	LOCATION	as the one most foreigners think they have learned to know in the hotels near the Boulevards .

		From this Babylon she enters a quiet little pension de famille -LRB- accent distinctly on famille -RRB- , where she gets her first idea of the real bulwark of
France	LOCATION	, the `` professional conscience . ''

		There follow glimpses of Parisian working girls , with whose lives Miss Sergeant became familiar through her interest in social betterment .

		Every - where she finds `` pride in the job well done , '' com - bined with a spirit of independence sprung from calm resignation to hardship that must be .

		In somewhat lighter vein is the sketch of the pre - Dreyfus-affair-bookseller Achille , whose ideals were formed before that unfortunate officer 's trial Had revolutionized literature .

		In the eyes of
M. Achille	PERSON	, the jeunes gens d'aujourd ` hui are raving with a fury anything but divine .

		Miss Sergeant is at pains to present us to one set of these methodless madmen , the Unanimiste poets .

		Other chapters take us to the provinces for an introduc - tion to a rustic poet of the Felibrigian brotherhood or to a village cure .

		Or again we are invited to one of the Entretiens d'Ete in the old monastery on the borders of Champagne and
Burgundy	LOCATION	which
M. Desjardins	PERSON	put at the disposal of modern seekers after truth .

		Delightful essays these , spark - ling with humor and conveying many a gentle hint to Americans who have presumed to sit in judg - ment on
France	LOCATION	that they are after all terriblement jeunes .

		`` Mme. Langeais liked to tell , for the benefit of young
America	LOCATION	, the story of an elderly count who , when his son kissed before the com - pany the bride whom he had brought for the first time to the family lunch-table , said in cold reproof : ` My son , I beg you to come down to-morrow tout embrasses already kissed . ' ''

		Miss Sergeant says she has collected the essays in book form with the intention of showing that the
France	LOCATION	we all admire to-day is not a phoenix risen from the ashes of the past , but a
France	LOCATION	`` living through these bitter years on the strength of her ancient everyday virtues . ''

		She has succeeded admirably .

		592 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 28	DATE	The psychology The .

		T * ur P ^ chic nature O f W it .

		associated with the name of
Freud	LOCATION	has found its way into popular rec - ognition in the tecnique of psycho-analysis ; and psycho-analysis is the art of relieving nervous disabilities by unearthing the hidden mainsprings of conflict which are responsible for instability .

		The sane and happy life is the adjusted life , in which the powers are exercised freely and fully and with a reaction of pleasure , defended by a temperamental optimism .

		Such a view , in the hands of Freud and his followers , lays bare the mechanisms of adjustment , and sets forth the complicated array of forces which strive for hap - piness ; and among these the saving sense of humor holds a high place .

		More particularly it unearths the system of defences laid well down in subconscious foundations , by which are warded off all menaces of content .

		Over-restraints and resistances imposed by the stringencies of exis - tence the contrasts between what life brings and what is desired carry the peril of breakdown as well as of unhappiness .

		Fun leavens the mass .

		It is not so well understood that Freudian inter - pretations have extended to many of the side-paths of the mental machinery , and there aimed at an interpretation of human nature in its less stren - uous and less official moments .

		Of these the most engaging is the analysis of Wit , which Dr.
Freud	PERSON	presents under the title , `` Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , now available in a translation by Dr.
A. A. Brill	PERSON	.

		The problems are these : Why are things amusing ?

		What are the varieties of wit ?

		What is the nature of the relief which wit affords ?

		What mechanisms does wit employ ?

		The central con - clusions reached are that many of the mechanisms used by the subconscious in its `` nervous '' struggles , appearing again in the dramatic transformation of dreams , are also at work in wit ; dream pro- cesses and wit processes are similar .

		For the justification of the thesis the reader must be referred to the rather prolix analysis of the text ; and this not without misgivings , for the argument is not easy to follow , and by that token still less easy to summarize .

		But the reader will carry away the valuable impression that underlying wit , farce , humor , the comic , the nai 've , the ridiculous , and the silly , even the sacrilegious and the obscene , there is a play of mental forces , and the reflex of personal and social esteem , that is at once interesting and important .

		The impression is more convincing that Dr.
Freud	PERSON	has seen the problem correctly , has mastered the approaches and found a key , and less convincing that he has utilized to the full the elements of his vision and the possibil - ities of his technique .

		What is needed is not so much a translation as a revised version of
Freud	LOCATION	, better adapted to the apprehending temperament of the Anglo-Saxon mind .

		And then there remains the constant bug-bear of sex allusions , in which some see significant truth and others irrelevant obscenity .

		There is less of it in this volume than in others , but enough to disturb the perspective .

		The book can not be neglected either by those who wish to study Freud or by those who wish to study the sense of humor .
