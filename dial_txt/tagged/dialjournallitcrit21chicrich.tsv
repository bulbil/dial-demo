		26 SCIENCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS .

		Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	, in a recent contribu - tion to '' Science , '' tells the following story : '' The professor of mineralogy in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	one day observed two young women examining his min - eral cabinet , one of whom was evidently searching for some particular species .

		Offering his help , he found that the object of her quest was feldspar .

		When shown the mineral she seemed very much interested in the specimens , expressing herself as gratified at having the chance to see and touch them .

		The professor asked her why she so desired to see the particular mineral .

		The answer was that for some years she had been obliged to teach in a neighboring high school , among other things , mineralogy and geology , and that the word feldspar occurred so often in the text-book that her curiosity had become aroused as to its appearance . ''

		Upon reading such a story , the first impulse of anyone having to do with educational work is to make it the text for a disquisition upon the incapacity that our schools so often serve to shelter .

		Undoubtedly , the gravest defect in our system of public education is that it gives employment to , or rather that it is forced to put up with , teachers who have no scientific knowledge of the subjects in which they give what is called instruction .

		But this theme is so well-worn that we should despair of finding anything new to say about it .

		There is , how - ever , an aspect of the matter that is compara - tively neglected , and upon which it may be well to offer a few reflections .

		Professor
Shaler	PERSON	has a well-earned reputa - tion as a specialist in geology , but he proves to be unlike most specialists in one very important respect .

		Instead of urging , as many men would have done under the circumstances , a better school equipment in geology , and the employ - ment of carefully-trained teachers , he questions the advisability of including his subject at all in the work of the secondary school .

		He says : '' For my own part , while it seems to me that some general notions concerning the history of the earth may very well be given to children , and this as information , it is futile to essay any study in this science which is intended to make avail of its larger educative influences with immature youths .

		The educative value of geology depends upon an ability to deal with the large concep - tions of space , time , and the series of developments of energy which can only be compassed by mature minds .

		Immature youths , even if they intend to win the utmost profit from geology , would be better occupied in study - ing the elementary tangible facts of those sciences such as chemistry , physics , or biology , sciences which in their 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, synthesis constitute geology , rather than in a vain en - deavor to deal in an immediate way with a learning which in a good measure to be profitable has to be ap - proached with a well developed mind .

		The very fact that any considerable geological problem is likely to involve in its discussion some knowledge of physics , chemistry , zoology , and botany is sufficient reason for postponing the study until the pupil is nearly adult . ''

		One of the most satisfactory features of the discussion of which secondary education has recently been made the subject is the tendency to concentrate the work in natural science upon a few subjects , in order to do fuller justice to whatever work of that class is attempted .

		There is a growing recognition of the simple fact that science is a discipline and not a mere matter of information , and those who best appreciate the value of science in secondary education are coming to realize that better results may be gained by the serious study of two or three sub - jects than by the superficial survey of half a dozen .

		As long as science-teaching was an affair of the text-book and the memoriter exer - cise , it did not much matter whether the sub - jects taught were few or many ; in either case , they contributed next to nothing to the stu - dent 's intellectual growth .

		But we have got distinctly beyond that primitive stage in our methods , and have learned to recognize the all - important character of the laboratory and the note - book .

		This being the case , we are brought face to face with the fact that few schools are large enough or sufficiently well-supported to afford the luxury of half a dozen laboratory outfits , and that the old-fashioned high-school curricu - lum , with its '' fourteen weeks '' in this science and its half-year in that , has become hopelessly antiquated .

		The reason why the young woman in Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's story had never seen a piece of feldspar was probably that she had been set to teach , besides geology , a medley of such subjects as physics , chemistry , botany , zoology , astronomy , and human physiology .

		Under the circumstances it would have been unreasonable to expect her to know feldspar by sight ; or , for that matter , to dissect a cat , or perform an operation in quantitative analysis .

		Professor
Tarr	PERSON	, in '' The Educational Review '' for
June	DATE	, gives us a delightful bit of personal experience with the system that produces sci - ence teachers who have never seen feldspar to know it .

		He says : '' A short time ago , I found a teacher in a normal school in the State of
New York	LOCATION	, who , with the aid of an assistant , was obliged to try to train teachers to impart instruc - tion in physiology , anatomy , zoology , botany , geology , physical geography , geography proper , astronomy , physics , and chemistry .

		Now tem - perance physiology is added . ''

		The sooner the absurdity of such an attempt is realized , and the sooner our high schools throw overboard two-thirds of this ill-assorted cargo , the more likely science will be to justify the claims that have so long been made on its behalf , and that have thus far remained at ludicrous vari - ance with its results , as far , at least , as three - fourths of our high schools and colleges are concerned .

		Professor
Tarr	PERSON	's suggestion for the reorgan - ization of science work in the secondary school is worthy of consideration , although we think that it makes too great a concession to an un - worthy popular ideal .

		He urges , in brief , that each secondary school should make a specialty of one scientific subject , teaching it in the most approved modern way , with the help of collec - tions , apparatus , and laboratories .

		The other subjects , in response to '' the demand of the people for information in the various branches of national science , '' should be distinctly classed -LRB- for that school -RRB- as '' minor sciences , '' and pur - sued in the old superficial way .

		Meanwhile , the colleges should come to the aid of the schools by permitting a greater freedom of choice in their entrance requirements , so that prepara - tory work done in one subject should be as available for admission as work done in any other , provided that it meet a somewhat rigid set of conditions as to methods and time em - ployed .

		While some such plan as this may be found necessary , as marking the transitional stage of secondary work in which we are likely to remain for some years yet , it can hardly be urged as a finality .

		Our ultimate aim must be , in all the grades of school and college work , to secure the best , even at the cost of a somewhat ruthless treatment of the indefensible popular notion .

		We must resolutely seek to subordinate the ideal of information to the ideal of discipline , and be willing to relegate to personal tastes and later opportunities the acquisition of knowl - edge upon many subjects of the highest scien - tific importance .

		What is all-important to the student is a comprehension of the method of science ; he may safely be left , if this is once given him , to possess himself of as much of the matter as his inclinations and interests may demand .

		A narrow but thorough discipline is vastly better than a wide and discursive range of information .

		This may be got without the stimulus of a strictly-ordered programme ; that
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 9 will hardly be acquired except under guidance at school or college .

		Perhaps the best evidence of the value of such a training as is here advo - cated may be found in the higher education of the traditional English system .

		That system has often been charged with ignoring many important intellectual interests , and there is no doubt that it has done so .

		But its vindication may be found in the type of trained intellect that it has projected into the arena of public life , and amply satisfies the judicious observer .

		THE CYNICISM OF THACKERAY AND THE SADNESS OF GEORGE ELIOT .

		It would be useless to deny that in the novels of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	, if you go deep enough and pause to reflect , there is an undercurrent of cynicism or sadness .

		But one is very unfortunately constituted who can see nothing in the great tender heart of
Thackeray	PERSON	but a love of depicting human failings and shams , or who can overlook
George Eliot	PERSON	's exquisite play of humor and imagination , and impute to her everywhere an impenetrable sad - ness .

		What we think of these authors will depend , I fancy , on our passing mood no less than on the view of life we may have formulated for ourselves .

		`` We are all optimists and pessimists by turns .

		We have our gray days and gold .

		There are times when our spiritual eye is shut , if not blinded , when we are inclined to believe that meanness and snob - bery and unhappiness prevail : then
Thackeray	PERSON	is no cynic to us , nor even a satirist , but a veritable realist .

		After some lively experience of human rascality or baseness , we believe for the moment that he drew
Becky Sharp	PERSON	and the
Marquis of Steyne	ORGANIZATION	from life .

		Then we patch up the vagrant shreds of his wisdom into a '' philosophy , '' and , hav - ing no better , affect with him '' the vanity of all things and the enjoyment of as much as you can . ''

		But the majority are , or like to think they are , con - stitutional optimists .

		To them
Thackeray	PERSON	is a sat - irist .

		They begrudge him the title of humorist .

		They see too plainly '' black care behind the moody horseman . ''

		His mirth proceeds from his melan - choly , which they can not discern is '' relieved by an always present capacity for instant frolic . ''

		They deprive themselves of a great deal of pleasure by dubbing him '' cynic , '' or '' sceptic '' -LRB- as Mr.
Whipple	PERSON	preferred -RRB- ; and , insisting on these names , which imply a more or less elaborate system of unbelief , they do him an injustice .

		For was there ever a novelist who had less conception of principles , who inquired less earnestly into the meaning and pur - pose of phenomena ?

		As well might we expect a close analysis of motives from
Scott	PERSON	, who intended '' Ivanhoe '' to be '' a tale of chivalry , not of char - acter , '' and said , '' The world will not expect from me a poem in which the interest turns on char - acter . ''

		Thackeray inspected human nature pretty narrowly in parts .

		He caught the peculiarities of individuals .

		The trend of things was beyond him .

		The world was a great spectacle that drifted care - lessly before his eyes , alternately pathetic or gay , always picturesque .

		He did not occupy himself with grand passions or mighty sentiments .

		We forgive his limited vision '' because of the telling . ''

		Not a page but has the merit of being readable .

		Some cynics , indeed , are very interesting , and , once roused to the pitch of enthusiasm , delight beyond measure .

		Jacques was a cynic , and how admirable , when he bursts upon us with his '' A fool , a fool !

		I met a fool i ' the forest , A motley fool ; a miserable world ! ' '

		which , apart from
Arden	LOCATION	, has a very Thackerayan ring .

		Now
George Eliot	PERSON	, with her profound moral pur - pose and grasp of life as a whole , was less free to charm us by the way .

		Superficial attractions are not often coupled with such originality and power .

		Leaving out of the question the critics , who have generally managed to find an overflowing humor in her novels with the possible exception of ''
Deronda	PERSON	, '' and vaguely granting that she was at heart a pes - simist , shall we let her gloomy philosophy so reso - lutely concealed , her unparaded despair , be the cri - terion of our literary judgment ?

		Is every novel predominantly sad ?

		Shall there be no discrimina - tion between her early and her late work ?

		Shall The Mill on the Floss '' and ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	'' be classed with '' Middlemarch '' and '' Deronda '' ?

		In ''
Adam Bede	PERSON	, '' do the quaint , brusque philosophy of the workshop and the sketch of
Chad	LOCATION	's
Bess	PERSON	and the inimitable wit of Mrs.
Poyser	PERSON	count for nothing against the dark screen of passion ?

		Who will say that '' ' Middlemarch '' is not as full of humor as of the ironies of fate , with its Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	, '' who had travelled in his younger years , and was held to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind '' ; with its Mrs.
Cadwallader	PERSON	, the rector 's wife , who was u obliged to get her meals by stratagem , and pray to heaven for her salad oil '' ; with its pompous Mr.
Trumbull	PERSON	, who went through his illness '' much sustained by appli - cation of the thermometer which implied the import - ance of his temperature , by the sense that he fur - nished objects for the microscope , and by learning many new words which seemed suited to the dignity of his secretions . ''

		True , the enigmas of existence and destiny are in the background , constantly puz - zling the logical sense and the imagination ; but , as one reads , he is quite as susceptible to the author 's graces of style , her humor , her eloquence , her graphic portrayal of character .

		As in life , so in a novel , it 's the little things that make or mar an hour 's enjoy - ment .

		One must feel that he is in agreeable com - pany .

		Be the story blithe and tactful , sparkling cheerily on the surface , he will , for the moment , be lulled to forget distressful problems , like the child in the old German fable who picked the berries that grew in the cleft of the rock , oblivious of the 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, abyss beneath , and of the fierce dragon lying in wait on the firm ground above .

		But no thoughtful reader can , in the long run , neglect the interpretation of the scroll .


Anthony Trollope	PERSON	went so far as to assert that '' the object of a novel should be to instruct in morals while it amuses . ''

		There is truth in the assertion , though it reverses the natural order , and '' amuse '' is too light a word to convey the serious artistic purpose of one who would portray human society or character .

		So very much is required of a great artist .

		No wonder
Thackeray	PERSON	did n't take himself seriously as a moralist !

		Most of his stories , all but ''
Esmond	PERSON	'' perhaps , read as if he began them with no certainty of how they should come out .

		And yet they are , part by part , nobly perfect .

		Kather than call `` Van - ity Fair '' an '' outrage on the constitution of the world , '' or go to the other extreme and declare its moral to be that '' the Amelias of the world , with all their simplicity and ignorance , will , in the long run , succeed better than the
Becky Sharps	PERSON	, '' is it not better first to inquire if it had a moral ?

		Shall we love him less if we find that he sought merely to transcribe life as he observed it , extracting what measure of humor he could for our entertainment ?

		Generous , guileless soul !

		How many of the novelists of to-day have exerted so beneficent an influence ?

		It was a law of the Medes and Persians , worthy of all homage , never to speak evil of a man who had given you pleasure .

		THE PUZZLE OF ENGLISH HEXAMETERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of course all intelligent critics agree that English hexameters , conforming to Greek or Latin rules of '' quantity by position , '' etc. , are extremely difficult to compose .

		In the very example quoted approvingly by your reviewer of my '' Art and Humanity in Homer '' -LRB- THE DIAL ,
June 1	DATE	-RRB- there are , not one , but four , vio - lations of this very law !

		With the important additional burden of faithful adherence to an original text , any such attempt becomes ludicrously hopeless .

		But everyone feels , too , that English syllables are not actually long or short in accordance with any such '' law . ''

		Quantity , in a sense , we have still , but largely variable , with many gradations , affected greatly by accent and cadence , partly even within the control of a judicious reciter .

		All English verse in such metres e. g. , '' Loch - invar , '' which is '' anapaestic '' are read in about 3-8 time , instead of 4-8 , the accented part of each foot pre - dominating , a '' dactyl '' becoming -LRB- circa -RRB- a quarter-note , followed by two sixteenth-notes .

		Hence the chief dan - ger in the rhythm is that we may force into the latter half of a '' dactyl '' syllables so clearly long that they resist the process of clipping required by the metre .

		Longfellow is a great sinner in this regard , though `` Miles Standish '' shows a rhythmical improvement upon '' Evangeline . ''

		Clough has utterly impossible lines in the '' Bothie , '' but comparatively perfect verses in the brief preludes of the '' Amours de Voyage . ''

		But difficult though it be , and remote from its class - ical namesake , our hexameter , a stumbling-block and a torture to classical scholars -LRB- e. g. , to your critic -RRB- , is ap - parently a favorite with the folk .

		Probably all of us know people who listen more eagerly to '' Evangeline '' than to any other form of verse .

		This fact , and the metre 's convenient length , are important arguments in its favor with the translator .

		Even the Hellenist will agree , that the ignorant barbarian might better have indicated for him , in some way , the end of the original verse the actual pause in the rhythm and the sense .

		Once concede that translations have any function or use at all , and you must fairly face the question : What English rhythm , sufficiently dignified , lending itself at all to faithful transfusion of the thought , will also per - mit us to show approximately the length of the original verse ?

		The clashing couplets of Pope , the long lilt of Chap - man , and the placid iambic monotony of the blank verse translators , have filled the ears , and prejudice the aud - itor against Homer in English dactyls .

		Perhaps a fairer test may be reached on less familiar ground .

		Let me offer here -LRB- from an unpublished volume -RRB- Hesiod 's open - ing lines : '' Muses who came from
Pieria	LOCATION	, giving renown by your singing , Come ye , and tell us of Zeus , and chant ye the praise of the Father : He , who to mortal men has apportioned fame or oblivion : Named or nameless are they by the will of Zeus the eternal . ''

		The difficulties become almost insuperable in the elegiac stanza .

		Yet even there the instinct of imitation is strong .

		To lessen the strain on your type-font and proof-reading , let me set here , not a bit of Greek , but a sextette of Catullus , and ask your critic -LRB- after demol - ishing my faint far Saxon echo -RRB- to show us in what form he himself would present to a sympathetic unclassical reader the tender thought of the Roman friend : `` Si quicqnam mutis gratum acceptumve sepulcris Accidere a nostro ,
Calve	LOCATION	, dolore potest , Quo desiderio veteres renovamus amores , Atque olim missaa fletnus amicitias , Certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est Quintiliae , quantum gaudet amore tuo . '' ''

		If there is aught , O Calvus , which out of our agony offered , Unto the voiceless dead grateful or welcome may be , When we revive with insatiate longing our ancient affection , When for the ties we lament , broken , that once have been ours , Though Quintilia grieve for her own untimely departure , Yet in thy faithful love , greater , be sure , is her joy .

		THE DIAL 11
Kefo RICHARD BKINSL.EY SHERIDAN	PERSON	.

		* A good
Life of Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	, such as Mr.
W. Fraser Rae	PERSON	now gives us , has long been needed .

		In his Introduction to the work ,
Lord Dufferin	PERSON	, the great-grandson of the brilliant orator and dramatist , alludes to the special pleasure with which he read , some years ago , Mr.
Rae	PERSON	's book on ''
Wilkes	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	, and Fox , '' adding that he then determined , should opportunity offer , to suggest to the author that he write a com - plete biography of
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Presumably the suggestion was made ; and
Lord Dufferin	PERSON	now expresses his entire satisfaction with its present outcome , attesting that the work has been un - dertaken and carried out with the cordial ap - proval and cooperation of
Sheridan	PERSON	's descend - ants .

		Whatever , he says , the family could do to facilitate Mr.
Rae	PERSON	's labors has been done ; accuracy and impartiality , tempered by that benevolence of treatment of which the most blameless stand in need and of which
Sheridan	PERSON	has hitherto seldom received the benefit , being all that they bargained for .

		`` Mr.
Algernon Sheridan	PERSON	, the present representative of the house , has placed all the
Sheridan	PERSON	papers at his disposal .

		A certain number of contemporary memoirs , which had not been published in
Moore	LOCATION	's time , have still further assisted him ; while his own indefatigable energy in ascertaining dates , in sifting the loose statements of others , and in hunting rp and down through
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
Scotland	LOCATION	for any vestiges of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence which may have been hidden away among the archives of the great Whig houses , has led to the discovery of many new and interesting facts . ''


Sheridan	PERSON	has hitherto fared hardly at the hands of his biographers .


Watkins	PERSON	's bungling Life is justly styled by Lord Dufferin '' a piece of bookmaking of the worst type '' ;
Moore	PERSON	's narrative is perfunctory , grudging , and often inaccurate ;
Smyth	PERSON	's sketch is a nestf ul of libels ; '' Sheridiana '' has probably next to nothing authentically Sheridian in it ; while later writ - ers -LRB- with two or three brilliant exceptions , such as Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	-RRB- , drawing perforce on the old more or less dubious sources , have too seldom deviated into sense or matter of actual information .

		Nor have the playwrights been behindhand in swelling and embellishing the
Sheridan	PERSON	myth .

		The most surprising at - tempt in this way is perhaps
M. Langle	PERSON	's '' Un Homme de Rien , '' which had a long run at the * SHERIDAN : A Biography .

		By
W. Fraser Rae	PERSON	.

		With Introduction by the
Marquess of Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	and Ava .

		In
UFO	ORGANIZATION	volumes , with portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Paris Vaudeville Theatre	ORGANIZATION	in
1863	DATE	.

		The play reads like a parody on Charles Lever though it undoubtedly aims actually to portray the dashing and versatile author of '' The Rivals . ''

		A synopsis of this truly Gallic production will serve to show the quaint general resemblance of
M. Langle	ORGANIZATION	's conception of
Sheridan	PERSON	to that floating vaguely in the minds of not a few of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's own countrymen .

		The opening scene shows a tavern-garden at
Richmond	LOCATION	, adjoining a race-course .

		The usual habitues '' smart '' people , sharpers , jockeys , peddlers , and so on are assembled , among them one ''
Susannah O'Donnor	PERSON	, '' who is sell - ing lace cuffs .

		A young man -LRB- appropriately wearing an Oxford cap and gown -RRB- reels in , calls for gin , and is chastely reproved for his condi - tion by
Susannah	PERSON	.

		In his gratitude he tells her that his name is
Richard Brinsley Sheridan	PERSON	, and that he has left his university with high honors ; that his plays have been rejected by the managers and his articles by the editors , that he is starving , and that he has resolved to drown his sorrows in punch .

		Susannah counsels prudence , and tells him to take the '' waiting - seat '' where jockeys remain until they are en - gaged .

		He does this , and presently overhears the Marquis '' de Champrose '' tell '' Commo - dore Dunbar '' that he can bring down a mayfly on the wing with a bullet .

		The Commodore trumps this by boasting that he used to amuse himself by shooting away the bowl of a pipe , the stem of which a Polynesian chief obligingly held between his teeth , and offers to back him - self for forty pounds to repeat the trick then and there , if a man can be found to hold the pipe .

		Sheridan volunteers , and , when the feat is performed , gets the forty pounds .

		The Commodore 's jockey disappearing opportunely ,
Sheridan	PERSON	takes his place , wins the race , and receives a splendid diamond brooch .

		This he promptly hands to the '' Duchess of
Cardwell	PERSON	, '' who has torn her sleeve and asks for a pin .

		She declines to take a gift of such value , when
Sheridan	PERSON	-LRB- remembering
Raleigh	LOCATION	-RRB- pulls out the diamond and throws it into the river , where - upon the Duchess relents and graciously con - sents to use the pin .

		At last
Sheridan	PERSON	, having bestowed two pounds on an Irish cock-fighter and thirty-eight pounds on the clerk of the course , ends the day as poor as he began it , and falls asleep on the '' waiting-seat , '' where he dreams of ''
Susannah O'Donnor	PERSON	. ''

		His fortunes rise at a bound , however , and we pres - ently find him a leading dramatist , with the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	for his friend and the ''
Duch	PERSON	-
12	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ess of
Cardwell	ORGANIZATION	'' for his patron .

		Though fam - ous , he is still poor , and the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	sends him two thousand pounds anonymously .

		Guessing that it comes from her , he returns the money , and the Duchess , not to be outdone in magnan - imity , pitches the bills into the fire , saying : '' You threw your diamond into the
Thames	LOCATION	; now we are quits . ''

		Susannah is engaged as a lady 's maid ; the Irish cock-fighter becomes
Sheridan	PERSON	's valet ; and after a number of other equally stirring and probable incidents , the curtain falls upon
Sheridan	PERSON	as Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	and husband of
Susan O'Donnor	PERSON	'' !

		* Such is the conception of the great Whig orator and statesman which the French dram - atist managed to draw from long current au - thorities .

		It is surely high time that a serious , searching , and impartial Life of
Sheridan	PERSON	should be written one that may serve defin - itively to disengage his image from the mass of idle fable and party calumny which has so long encrusted it that , in the opinion of one author - ity , '' the real
Sheridan	PERSON	has disappeared for - To this task Mr.
Eraser Rae	PERSON	has very ever .

		successfully applied himself ; and his book may be fairly styled a substantial addition to his - tory and literature .

		While his narrative is by no means to be regarded as an apologia , due space is given to refuting in detail and with irresistible cogency calumnies for which Sher - idan , as an active party man at a time when such weapons were counted legitimate in polit - ical warfare , was a shining mark .

		One notable story of the kind , which Mr.
Rae	PERSON	explodes for all time , is Croker 's familiar account -LRB- based on details furnished him by
George IV	PERSON	. -RRB-

		of Sher - idan 's last days .

		This precious tale is replete with revolting particulars , and represents the dying Whig leader lying on a truckle-bed in an attic , in want of the commonest necessities , neglected by everybody , his wife included ; and so on .

		The real facts are set forth in a letter , now made public for the first time , from Sher - idan 's son
Charles	PERSON	, who was with him to the last , to an elder brother then at the
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	.


Charles Sheridan	PERSON	writes : '' You will be soothed by learning that our father 's death was unaccompanied by suffering , that he almost slumbered into death , and that the reports which you may have seen in the newspapers of the privations and the want of comforts which he endured are unfounded ; * A compatriot of
M. Langle *	ORGANIZATION	, M. Fr .

		Febre , has recently blundered amusingly about
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Writing from
America	LOCATION	, as special correspondent , he stated that soon after reaching
New York	LOCATION	he visited
Daly	PERSON	's Theatre , where he saw '' The Critic , '' by
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		He adds : '' La piece est une adaptation d'un ouvrage Allemand doux melange de poudding et de choucroute . ''

		-LRB- Le Gaulsis
Aug. 18 , 1895	DATE	. -RRB-

		that he had every attention and comfort which could make a death-bed easy ... My mother has of course been thrown back dreadfully by the affliction and fatigue which she has gone through .

		She attended my father to the last , though ordered not to move from a sofa ; while the painful scene lasted , the anxiety of her mind gave her , in spite of the pain she was in , a degree of strength which astonished me ; but as soon as it was over she completely sunk under it . ''

		What appears to us a very just and sugges - tive summary of a debated side of
Sheridan	PERSON	's character is contained in a statement made in writing by Mr.
Mulock	PERSON	to the late Honorable
Caroline Norton	PERSON	: '' To extol
Sheridan	PERSON	's unrivalled superiority over his great contemporaries -LRB- with the single exception of his countryman
Burke	PERSON	-RRB- is needless .

		In variform power of mind he excelled them all , and also in independence of spirit .

		Where be most failed as a public man was in his Irish yieldingness to Anglo-Saxon assumption and arrogance .

		Binding himself too implicitly to an un - grateful party , he became -LRB- unwittingly -RRB- a splendid drudge without permanent pay .

		Much of what is called
Sheridan	PERSON	's improvidence arose simply from the fact that his position was always higher than his pecuniary re - sources .

		He contracted debt , not in anticipation of real income , but on the strength of contingent expectations , not often fulfilled ; and yet , his entire liabilities , if summed up , would have been wiped away by a tithe of the ostentatious bounty lavished on
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and offered to
Pitt	PERSON	.

		No one , as you justly remark , ever held out a helping hand to
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		In his necessities he walked alone ...
Sheridan	PERSON	was noL a dishonest man , but his ' pride of place ' -LRB- not however with a placeman 's cer - tainties -RRB- involved him in engagements which he failed to keep , and those failures , by constant recurrence , en - gendered a fatal familiarity with promise-breaking .

		The world past and present overflows with such in - stances , but on a much larger scale of indebtedness than poor
Sheridan	PERSON	's . ''

		The fact is ,
Sheridan	PERSON	's debts were never con - siderable , and at his death were not much above five thousand pounds .

		This sum , however , was owed to a great number of people petty tradesmen , mainly , who had systematically robbed the large-hearted , easy-going Irishman while he lived , and who moved heaven and earth with their plaints against him when he was dead .

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	states that when
Sheridan	PERSON	's affairs were strictly investigated it was found that for every twenty shillings which he owed , his creditors had received thirty .

		Thus these leeches , having sucked their victim dry , cursed his incapacity to yield more blood .

		That there have been few men more careless of the maxim '' A penny saved is a penny gained '' than
Sheridan	PERSON	, and that the tradesmen he dealt with were cheerfully ready to profit by the fact , certain extant accounts against him show .

		For instance : ''
William Smith	PERSON	charged him 3 15s .

		for pomatum and hair powder from
May	DATE	to
December	DATE	, while the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 charge for hair-cutting was os .

July	DATE	are charged 3s .

		a pottle , and cherries , when most plentiful , 5s .

		6d .

		the pound . ''

		In fine ,
Sheridan	PERSON	seems to have paid his butcher , his fruiterer , his wine-dealer , his per - ruquier , etc. , in toto about a third more than he honestly owed them ; yet it is mainly the recorded clamors of these gentry over their '' little bills '' outstanding at the time of his death which have moved inconsiderate biog - raphers to insult his memory with their misap - plied moralizing .

		For
Sheridan	PERSON	was an essen - tially honest -LRB- if often culpably heedless -RRB- man , the life-long dupe of dishonest men ; an un - bought politician in an age when venality was the rule ; a statesman who could boast with truth to his wife : '' My price is not on this earth to do otherwise than what was right and go straight forward . ''

		It is easy , says
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, to be virtuous on five thousand a year .


Sheridan	PERSON	's virtue as a public man had no such comfortable prop .

		Dependent upon his own exertions for a livelihood , he had counted the cost of being true to his convictions , saying once to Lord Byron : '' It is easy for my Lord G. or
Earl G.	PERSON	or Marquess B. , with thousands upon thousands a year , ... to boast of their patriotism and keep aloof from temptation ; but they do not know from what temptation those have kept aloof , who had equal pride , or at least equal talents , and not unequal passions , and nevertheless knew not in the course of their lives what it was to have a shilling of their own . ''

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	has told the romantic and diversified story of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's career well and temperately though perhaps his final conclusion that ''
Sheridan	PERSON	is the greatest dramatist since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the greatest orator who ever addressed the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, '' is open to exception .

		His book at once takes its place as the standard one on the subject the one in which the real
Sheridan	PERSON	, as contradistinguished from the half-mythical
Sheridan	PERSON	of previous memoirs , is portrayed with all attainable clear - ness .

		To release this brilliant and singularly winning and humane figure from the region of largely calumnious fiction was a worthy task ; and Mr.
Rae	PERSON	has done it so satisfactorily as to render fault-finding both difficult and ungra - cious .

		The volumes are handsomely made throughout , and contain a number of attractive portraits , several of them after originals by
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Gainsborough	PERSON	, and
Hoppner	PERSON	.

		SOME RECENT BOOKS OF TRAVEL .

		* Mr.
W. A. Chanler	PERSON	, in his '' Through Jungle and Desert , '' describes a journey taken in com - pany with Lieutenant von Hohnel through an unexplored section of
Northeast Africa	LOCATION	.

		Though the expedition was '' purely in the interest of science , '' the book is chiefly a pop - ular description , the only very obvious scientific results being the fine maps prepared by Lieu - tenant von Hohnel .

		But barring some minor criticism , this is a well-prepared book of travels , and describes some important discoveries , nota - bly that of the Rendile , who were straight-haired and blue-eyed , and seemed to the author '' the most original and interesting of all the strange and different peoples met in
East Africa	LOCATION	. '' ''

		They are a tall , thin race , reddish-brown in color , with soft , straight , and closely cropped hair , features almost Caucasian in their regularity , and fierce blue eyes .

		They were clad in well-tanned robes of goat or sheep skin , which they threw gracefully over their shoulders .

		They were armed with short spears , or well - made bows of a shape very different from those I had heretofore seen in
East Africa	LOCATION	, the ends being curved outward , as in the Asiatic bow ; and their arrows were not tipped with poison ... The warriors rarely car - ried shields ; a few , however , had them .

		These were curious in shape ; some were made of woven twigs , others of oryx hide ... Nearly all the warriors painted their faces with a white clay , which lent ferocity to their appearance .

		They all wore their hair cut short , and I was much struck by the fact that it appeared perfectly straight and of fine texture . ''

Chanler	PERSON	's style is clear and in general cor - rect , and on the whole he has given us a dis - tinctly valuable and entertaining work , both as a detailed account of travel in unexplored ter - ritory and as a narration of remarkable adven - * THROUGH JUNGLE AND DESERT : Travels in

July 1	DATE	, tures not only with wild men but wild beasts .

		The most troublesome of the latter were the rhinoceroses , which were numerous and aggres - sive .

		During one march of eighteen days more than a hundred of them were seen , and twenty - five of them charged the caravan . ''

		One of these charges proved fatal .

		It was in the
early morning	TIME	.

		We were in need of meat , and seeing a giraffe in front I fired a shot at it from my Winchester .

		The report awoke two rhinoceroses taking a morning nap , not fifty feet to the left of the caravan , and in close proximity to the porters .

		In a moment loud cries of ` Faro !

		Faro ! '

		-LRB- Rhinoceros ! -RRB-

		were heard , and looking back I saw my men scattering in all directions , but no rhinoceros .

		Soon from among the mass of my men I saw one of their number shot up into the air to the height of twenty feet , and presently there emerged from the crowd a rhinoceros with horn lowered to the earth ... Owing to the massing of my men , I was unable to shoot until the fleeing negroes had passed within a few feet of me , and the rhinoceros was almost upon them .

		I gave him a shot from my Winchester ; it seemed to have no effect but to cause him to make a perceptible gain upon my men .

		His horn appeared to be within a few inches of them , when a second and more fortunate shot from my rifle broke his fore leg , and brought him to the ground .

		He fell but three paces from where I stood .

		Not know - ing where I had struck him , and seeing him fall , I thought he was dead ; but when I approached him he rose on his hind legs and supported himself with his head , madly snorting all the while .

		Seeing he could not move , I left him and ran back to see what had hap - pened in the rear of the caravan . ''

		The hunting-dogs were found very useful in these encounters with the rhinoceros , attacking the huge beast with great ferocity and holding his attention so that the riflemen were able to approach and shoot at close range .

		The only animal which filled the dogs with timidity was the lion ; though once the whole canine pack was put to flight by a group of dog-faced baboons .

		The curious incident is thus described : '' We first heard the baboons barking , and finally came in sight of them , running along for all the world like school-children on a holiday .

		The young ones were playing together , carefully watched by their elders , who preserved the most staid demeanor .

		Upon catching sight of them , the dogs rushed at the band in a furious manner .

		The young ones fled , but two or three old gen - tlemen with bushy whiskers and benignant eyes seated themselves upon their hams and gazed unruffled at the enemy .

		The dogs dashed on , but their barks became less determined , and their steps more cautious , as they neared , and realized the dignity of the animals they were to attack .

		These made no sign , but calmly awaited their charge .

		Haying reached a point within fifteen feet of them , the courage of the dogs seem to ooze rap - idly from them .

		Frightened perhaps by the steady and philosophic stare with which the apes regarded them , they turned tail , and with crestfallen manner retreated to the caravan . ''

		Another entertaining work on
Africa	LOCATION	is Mr.
Knight	PERSON	's ``
Madagascar	LOCATION	in War-Time , '' which narrates its author 's experiences , impressions , and opinions as correspondent for the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' during the late invasion of the island by the French .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	had an interest - ing overland journey of over five hundred miles , from
Fort Dauphin	LOCATION	to the capital ,
Antanana	LOCATION	- rivo , where he remained for some months , until after its capture by
General Duchesne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The account is written in the direct , matter-of-fact , aggressive , cocksure style of the English news - paper correspondent .

		However , the work has considerable value and interest as an evidently fair and trustworthy report upon the country and its peoples , and also upon the status of Christian missions in
Madagascar	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	, while he concedes a considerable value to the work of the missionaries , is severely critical , and finds little to praise in the character of the Hovas , who are the chief converts .

		However , the Hovas quickly acquire certain aspects of civilization , and they show much taste for ora - tory and music .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	was also favor - ably impressed by the school he visited , and by a dedicatory church service he attended .

		The Queen bore herself with due dignity at this meeting ; but not so the ladies of her suite . ''

		The poor little maids of honor who surrounded me were evidently not at all comfortable .

		They put on their gorgeous Parisian attire only on great occasions , such as this was , and never thoroughly accustom them - selves to the confinement of stays , shoes , socks , and gloves .

		Several of the young ladies fidgeted about , and at last one , who sat immediately in front of me , could support the pain no longer .

		After glancing over her shoulder at me with a demure smile , she proceeded to take off her shoes , and then tried to unhook the back of her dress .

		She found some difficulty in doing this , and I was wondering whether it would be a breach of Hova etiquette for me to assist her in the operation , when a fair maiden came to her rescue . ''

		M.
Andre Chevrillon	PERSON	, in his book entitled '' In
India	LOCATION	, '' presents a series of letters describ - ing the usual round of tourist 's sights , but writ - ten with a certain Gallic intensity and origin - ality which will interest many .

		His sketches are slight yet artistic impressions , are full of air and color , and are vivid , tense , and delicate in style , reminding one of
M. Bourget	PERSON	's '' Outre Mer . ''

		The translation appears to be well done .


M. Chevrillon	PERSON	is evidently an open-minded , cultured Parisian , and his observations , though in general none too accurate and thorough , often show insight .

		Thus , this remark -LRB- p. 89 -RRB- is full of suggestiveness : '' Every day , for more than twenty-five hundred years , since Buddhism was a protest against the tyranny and absurdity of rites , has this race mechanically passed through this machinery , resulting in what mental mal -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 formations , what habitual attitudes of mind and will , the race is now too different from ourselves for us to be able to conceive .

		A negro , a
Terra del Fuegan	ORGANIZATION	savage , resembles us more than do these people .

		The negro is more simple than we , nearer to the life of the animals ; but if we divest ourselves of the unstable acquirements of our civilization , we discover , concealed , yet alive in the depths of our souls , nearly all of his instincts .

		On the contrary , the Hindu soul is as completely developed as our own ; its vegetation is no less rich , but it is en - tirely different .

		It is stupefying to see the crowd of ideas , according to us incoherent and absurd , that form the substance of their minds . ''

		Captain
F. E. Younghusband	PERSON	's '' The Heart of a Continent '' is a very simple personal nar - rative of varied wanderings in
Manchuria	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, Chinese Turkestan , and in the Hima - layas , and these mostly in little known or un - known territory .

		However , he has not suc - ceeded in presenting us with as valuable or interesting a book of travels as his achieve - ments and experiences would lead us to expect .

		Much of the present book is a rather uninter - esting , condensed , matter-of-fact itinerary ; and even in describing his chief exploit , the cross - ing of the Old Mustagh Pass , he is much too modest and reserved a writer to make a very entertaining story .

		On the whole , the descrip - tive chapter on
Chitral	LOCATION	, the suggestive chapter on Christian missions in
China	LOCATION	, and the chap - ter of '' Impressions , '' will be found of most interest to the general reader .

		The book has a considerable value to the geographer , and the political student will find some light thrown on the relations of
China	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	in the Himalayan region .

		There are also some good descriptions of wild life , from which we will quote a short account of the manner in which eagles are captured among the Kirghiz a nomadic tribe scattered through the open valleys of the
Pamirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		These people use eagles for hawking purposes , even for securing small deer ; and they capture the birds by the strange method of riding them down . ''

		When I first saw a man starting off to gallop down an eagle , I thought he must be mad .

		We had seen two eagles on the ground in the distance , and as soon as the Kirghiz caught sight of them he set off wildly after them .

		They , of course , rose on seeing him , but he went careering down the valley after one of them , till gradually the bird sank down to the ground .

		It was , in fact , gorged with the flesh of the carcass it had been feeding on , and could no longer fly .

		The Kirghiz dismounted , seized hold of the bird , bound his waistcloth round and round the body and wings till he had made it up into a neat parcel , and then tucked it under his arm , mounted , and rode back to me .

		He said that if it turned out to be a good one for hawking , he might get two hundred rupees for it . ''

		In the handsome volume entitled '' On Snow - Shoes to the Barren Grounds , '' Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	gives us an account which is in the main a reprint of his recent articles in '' Har - per 's Magazine . ''

		Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	's trip was an unusually arduous one , being made in the win - ter ; and he writes of it in such a graphic and vigorous way that this volume is bound to ap - peal strongly to lovers of travel .

		For instance , his account of his killing of his first musk-ox -LRB- p. 221 -RRB- is very vivid .

		The musk-oxen , hav - ing been sighted , all his party were off pell - mell ; but Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	became separated from his Indians in the chase over the unending ridges . ''

		As I reached the bottom of each ridge , it seemed to me I could not struggle to the top , even though a thou - sand musk-oxen awaited my coming .

		I was in a dripping perspiration , and had dropped my capote and cartridge - belt , after thrusting half-a-dozen cartridges into my pockets .

		Everything waltzed about me .

		I ran on and on in a sort of stupor , until , as I got to the top of a little ridge , I saw two musk-oxen a hundred yards ahead , and running easily though directly from me .

		I swung my rifle into position and dropped on my knee for surer aim .

		Heavens !

		my hand shook so that the front sight trav - elled all over the horizon , and my heart thumped against my side as though it would burst .

		For a moment I rested to get my breath and then another attempt the fore sight for an instant held true a quick aim and I pressed the trigger .

		With what a feeling of ex - ultation as I saw my quarry stagger and then drop . '' ''


Cuba	LOCATION	and the Cubans '' gives the Cuban version of the causes of the present revolt , in - veighs with great fervor against Spanish abuses , and vindicates the Cubans against Spanish aspersions .

		While this book is of interest as an expression of Cuban patriotism , it is neither full nor trustworthy as a history and descrip - tion .

		For instance we have the astonishing information in a bare statement only -LRB- p. 429 -RRB- , that in the Cuban insurrection of the seventies '' 200,000 Spanish privates '' and `` 8000 Span - ish officers '' lost their lives !

		The book is rather poorly printed and illustrated .

		Mr.
W. E. Curtis	PERSON	, in his work on
Venezuela	LOCATION	, presents a general sketch based mostly on per - sonal observation .

		It is written in a fluent and interesting though often careless style , and the tone is reportorial and superficial .

		The informa - tion afforded is sometimes patently inaccurate ; thus , the torpedo is called a '' curious snake '' Cp .

		224 -RRB- , and the
Trinidad Pitch Lake	LOCATION	is said to furnish '' the world 's supply of asphaltum '' -LRB- p. 228 -RRB- .

		We also have the amazing state - ment that the Orinoco '' 240 miles from the sea '' `` is four and a half miles wide and 360 feet deep '' -LRB- p. 233 -RRB- .

		But in the absence of more thorough books on
Venezuela	LOCATION	, this volume 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, is of considerable value and interest .

		The ap - pendix contains the recent diplomatic docu - ments on the Venezuelan controversy , via. , President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's message , Secretary Ol - ney 's instructions to Mr.
Bayard	PERSON	, and the reply of the
Marquis of Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		STOKIES AND STUDIES OF NATURE .

		* Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	has added to his group of books on birds , the last of which was '' A
Florida	LOCATION	Sketch-Book , '' another , the fruits of a
summer	DATE	vacation spent in the South , with the title `` Spring Notes from
Tennessee	LOCATION	. ''

		This time he has visited the battle-fields of
Eastern Tennessee	LOCATION	, the city of
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, and the neighboring woods and hills .

		The titles of some of the chapters '' An Idler on Mission - ary Kidge , '' '' Lookout Mountain , '' ''
Chicka	PERSON	- mauga , '' `` Orchard Knob and the
National Cemetery	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' A Week on
Walden	PERSON	's Kidge '' will give an idea of the scope of the book .

		Like its predecessors , it consists of somewhat de - tailed accounts of days spent in the search for unfamiliar species of birds , or familiar ones in new haunts ; and he who charmed us with the sights and sounds of '' The Footpath Way '' now charms us equally with what he saw and heard in spots remote from his
New England	LOCATION	home , but no less beautiful .

		To what pleasant paths he has lured us will be seen from his own words : '' The place , besides , was alive with singing birds ... It was an exciting moment .

		Luckily , a man can look and listen both at once .

		Here was a fringe-tree , a noble specimen , hung with creamy - white plumes ; here was a magnolia , with big leaves and big flowers ; and here was a flowering dogwood , not to be put out of countenance in any company ; but especially , here were the rhodo - dendrons !

		And all the while , deep in the thickest of the bushes , some unknown bird was singing a strange , breathless jumble of a song , note tripping over note . ''

		To the student of nature , the book will recall pleasant reminiscences of his own bird-haunts , and afford him also new facts for comparison .

		The author has appended to the book a list of birds seen during this visit , both common and scientific names being given , with localities * SPRING NOTES FROM

		where they were seen .

		A few of the papers first appeared in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		Mrs.
Olive Thome Miller	PERSON	departs somewhat from her usual path in '' Four-Handed Folk . ''

		Here she tells us about various members of the monkey family , several of which have been pets of her own or of her friends .

		Among the varieties mentioned are the kiukajou , the lemur , the marmoset , the chimpanzee , and the spider monkey .

		The sketches are most amusing , and instructive as well , for familiarity and close observation have shown the author many new facts concerning these interesting animals .

		We are equally entertained , whether we read of pigmy marmosets , monkeys so tiny that two can carry on a battle royal in the palm of one 's hand , or of '' Mr.
Crowley	PERSON	, '' the famous chim - panzee of
Central Park	LOCATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	, who sat at table and ate like a human being .

		Sev - eral of the pets of whom these stories are told were kept in a girls ' school in
South America	LOCATION	a country where such companions are far more common than here ; and the adventures related are sometimes quite exciting .

		The pets all received the tenderest of care , and became , we are told , very friendly and affectionate , in many cases , too much so for the owner 's com - fort .

		Many mischievous pranks these favored '' beasties '' played , as the following will show : '' A favorite plaything with the lemur was a window - shade .

		He began by jumping up to the fringe , seizing it , and swinging back and forth .

		One day he learned by accident that he could ' set it off , ' and then his extreme pleasure was to snatch at it with so much force as to start the
spring	DATE	, when he instantly let go and made one bound to the other side of the room , or to the mantel , where he sat , looking the picture of innocence , while the released shade sprang to the top and went over and over the rod .

		We could never prevent his carrying out this little programme , and we drew down one shade only to have him slyly set off another the next instant . ''

		We leave the book with the feeling that we too for a little while would like to have a tiny four-handed friend ; but perhaps , after all , such companionship is more agreeable to read about than to experience .

		Mr.
Slade	PERSON	, in his '' Evolution of Horticulture in
New England	LOCATION	, '' has entered upon a some - what new field .

		His little book , which is most attractively gotten up , is evidently the result of much patient research among old archives , and traces the history of horticulture from the earliest attempts at planting in this country down to the present day , with its fine park sys - tems , botanical gardens , and horticultural soci - eties .

		There is a preliminary sketch of the art , showing how it had progressed in
England	LOCATION
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 up to the time when our forefathers left the '' old home , '' and describing the authors and writings whose influence was upon them when they first began to make gardens in the wilder - ness .

		The author quotes from many an old document ; and most quaint and readable are the accounts drawn from these source ?

		, with a bloom as of the old gardens of which they tell .

		Witness the following : '' This place hath very good land , affording rich Corne-fields , and fruitef ull Gardens : having likewise sweete and pleasant springs . ''

		Coming down to more re - cent times , Mr.
Slade	PERSON	describes some of the chief show-places in and around
Boston	LOCATION	, es - tates the beauty of whose grounds has kept their fame alive .

		He also devotes some space to the three forms of modern landscape gardening , the Beautiful , or Gardenesque ; the Picturesque ; and the Formal , or Geometrical . ''

		In the con - sideration of the gardening art , '' he tells us , '' wherever it is to be employed , it must be de - termined how closely nature and art can be re - lated to each other ... The individual who truly loves nature will be guided by following out her schemes , which vary indefinitely , and he will thus be led to the exercise of original thought . ''

		The book closes with a brief notice of the work and value of the various horticul - tural societies of to-day .

		`` Notes of the
Night	TIME	, and Other Outdoor Sketches , '' by Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	, is a group of delightful essays , three of which have ap - peared in ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine , '' from an author whose words and opinions are always welcome .

		Such a lover of out-of-doors life is he , such a keen observer , such a delver into out-of-the-way places , that we watch with much interest to see what he will find next to tell us .

		He never tires of giving us good advice , which far too few of us follow .

		For example : '' De - termine beforehand whither you will ramble , and make an early start . ''

		`` No walk is so successful as that in which we make a discov - ery . '' ''

		It is a sad mistake to become only a reader ... One excellent book is the blank one , to be filled by our own hands '' ; and other like words .

		But , since we can not all leave our duties in the dusty city , Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	brings for our delectation the fruits of his own rambles , and pleasant fruits they are .

		He tells us of moonlight strolls over fields and through woods , in
summer	DATE	and winter ; of floating on the river under the starlit sky , with an old recluse for companion , identifying the notes of birds and insects and fish ; of adventures in a boat on a flooded meadow '' when grass is green '' ; of a tramp '' out of the beaten path , '' to a pictur - esque mill ; of an old barn , and its inhabitants , plant and animal ; and of many other pleasant saunterings , in the course of which sharp eyes discovered and a ready pen has described many beautiful and odd things which the ordinarily unobservant pedestrian might never see .

		The last essay in the book is on
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and in it Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	defends from his friends the man who was in some ways our closest student of nature . ''

		The quickest way to send the world to perdition would be to make all men lead professional lives ; and the positive curse under which we now rest is that the absurdity is taught by parents to infants , and by teach - ers to scholars , that the true or best life is that of the preeminently learned , and that no dignity or honor or worthy reward of any kind comes to him who lives clos - est to Nature , and so most remote from the centres of civilization .

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ''
Kriegspiel	PERSON	, '' it is a Romany novel with an evident basis of fact and even of autobiography .

		We do not hesitate to say that it has but a single peer of its class , and that , it is hardly necessary to add , is Sorrow 's immortal '' Lavengro . ''

		The title is a mere whim , and is taken from the chimerical de - sign of one of the characters , who has great preten - sions as a wire-puller , and who aims at nothing less than the restoration of a Stuart to the English throne this , mind you , in the year of grace
1870	DATE	, or thereabouts .

		But the plan thus suggested is not of the real texture of the narrative , which is for the most part concerned with happenings that do not transcend the limits of the possible , and with people who might seem commonplace were it not for the extraordinary power and subtlety of their charac - terization .

		Although there is a good deal of
Gipsy	LOCATION	life in the book , and although this is its most dis - tinctive feature , the interest is nevertheless richly varied , for we have at once a tale of mystery , a study of manners , a philosophical romance , and a very charming example of prose style .

		There is about the whole affair an indescribable mixture of shrewdness , geniality , and penetrating observation , sufficient to furnish a dozen ordinary novelists with their stock-in-trade , yet here lavished upon the pages of a single volume .

		The book is one of the most remarkable that has come to our attention of recent years .

		We can not agree with Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	in claiming for the ''
Weir	PERSON	of
Hermiston	LOCATION	'' fragment the highest place among
Stevenson	PERSON	's writings .

		Had the work been completed in accordance with the design sketched out by his friend and literary exec - utor it might , indeed , have surpassed '' Kidnapped '' and '' Catriona '' ; but the fragment which we pos - sess offers nothing more than a promise or a pos - sibility of such preeminence .

		In elaboration of style , we think it may safely be said that the frag - ment equals , if it does not surpass , the best of
Stev	PERSON	- enson 's earlier work , but there the praise must end .

		As far as it goes , ''
Weir	PERSON	of
Hermiston	LOCATION	'' is not strik - ingly interesting , and it is marred by digressions that one is strongly tempted to skip , or , at least , to hurry over .

		The element of dialect is more prom - inent in this tale than Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	was wont to make it , and a glossary is actually required to make the text intelligible .

		This stumbling-block , together with the others touched upon , makes it difficult to attribute to anything but personal friendship , deep - ened by the sense of recent loss , Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's hasty dictum concerning the rank of this book among its fellows .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	's novels are always pleasant reading , and now and then surprise us by the revelation of an unexpected strength . ''

		Briseis '' is not one of these exceptional examples , but simply a pretty love story of the approved pattern , with plenty of High - land scenery , and enough perplexities to keep the plot going .

		The hero is a very familiar friend , but the heroine is given a slight dash of originality by her Greek name and parentage .

		The author works in , or rather drags in , most of the puns and other witticisms that he has picked up at the clubs since his last preceding story was published , and makes of the whole an agreeable enough sort of pastiche .

		There is a certain earnestness about the work of ''
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	'' that commands respect and compels interest , despite the heavy solemnity of its manner , and the narrowness of the life with which it deals . ''

		Clara Hopgood '' is a story of the for - ties , and the scene is laid in a small English town .

		The people concerned barely escape being common - place , and the motive that determines the course of the heroine at a critical juncture is almost unintel - ligible .

		Certainly , we can have slight sympathy with a girl who allows herself to be betrayed , and then refuses the reparation freely offered .

		The study of this situation has a considerable degree of psychological subtlety , and perhaps that was about all the author aimed to accomplish .

		Some
ten years ago	DATE	, there was published in En - gland , over the name of
J. Freeman Bell	PERSON	, a novel entitled `` The Premier and the Painter . ''

		It no?v appears that the name of the author was assumed , that the work was a joint production of two pens , and that the greater part of it was written by Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	.

		An American edition of the novel has just been published , making it , for our public at least , to all intents and purposes a new work of fic - tion .

		The story is extremely difficult of character - ization .

		In the first place , it is inordinately Idng , and probably no human being could read , without generous omissions , its five hundred closely-printed pages .

		It has , moreover , all the faults of prolixity , confusion , bad taste , and feebleness of wit that are found in Mr.
ZangwilPs	PERSON	later work , and that debar the writer from any very serious consideration at the hands of the critic .

		Yet it has , too , brilliant passages and episodes , a plot of extraordinary inge - nuity , and bits of characterization that would not have been unworthy of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		It is well described as '' a fantastic romance , '' for nothing more fantastic was ever conceived than the '' tangle of tragi-comic situations '' resulting from the confused identity of two men one the Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	and the other a man of the people whose striking personal resemblance makes it possible for each to play the other 's part for a time , until the assassina - tion of the pretended statesman forces the real statesman to forsake his disguise , and reappear in public life just after the consignment to the Abbey of what have been supposed to be his remains .

		The garrulity and riotous diction of the whole thing give constant offence to a reader of trained literary in - stinct , yet in spite of the offence , the interest grows , and his perseverence is rewarded by the tension of positive excitement as he approaches the close .

		It is a curious , and , whatever its faults , anything but a conventional book .

		Mr.
Percy Andreae	PERSON	's '' The Vanished Emperor '' has a plot that recalls , in a way , that of '' The Double Emperor '' of Mr.
W. Laird Clowes	PERSON	.

		In both stories , the Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	is the central figure , and
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 in both , also , his disappearance from his capital re - sults in grave domestic and foreign complications .

		Mr.
Andreae	PERSON	, however , does not kidnap his hero , but withdraws him from his court to marry , under an assumed name , the woman whom he loves , and who , as an ardent Hanoverian partisan , would have scorned a suit conducted in his own person .

		The mystery of the Emperor 's disappearance is well sus - tained , but the network of intrigue is a little too complicated to be easily grasped even after the facts have been exposed .

		The story drags a good deal at times , and goes in for too much description and irrelevant detail .

		But it is a clever piece of work , written in plain straightforward style , and having much variety of interest .

		There is something fas - cinating about such studies in conjectural politics , even when they have only a moderate literary value .

		Those who have wished that Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	might find in some work de tongue haleine an op - portunity for full display of the remarkable talents evinced by his shorter stories and sketches of French
Canada	LOCATION	may now congratulate him upon the pub - lication of a novel that amply justifies their expec - tations . ''

		The Seats of the Mighty '' is one of the most noteworthy examples of historical fiction that have come to us , even in these years that have been so prolific of good work in the field of romance based upon fact .

		It has for its subject the most strik - ing of all episodes in Canadian history
Wolfe	PERSON	's capture of
Quebec	LOCATION	and the treatment of this stir - ring theme is simply masterly .

		That no doubt may be left as to the serious historical purpose of the book , the illustrations are such things as portraits of
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	, reproductions of historically important buildings , and a map of
Quebec	LOCATION	and its surroundings .

		Yet there is nothing dull or pedantic in the treatment , although it is everywhere under - lain by faithful research among old maps , prints , and manuscripts . ''

		A piece of fiction which is not , I believe , out of harmony with fact '' is what the author claims his book to be , and as fiction it must be accorded a high place .

		The adventures of the hero , an English hostage at
Quebec	LOCATION	during the years preceding the downfall of the French power , are as absorbing in their interest as any related in the novels of such men as Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	and Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	, while Mr.
Parker	PERSON	knows how to give to his narra - tive a poetic touch that is quite beyond the power of these his fellow-workers in a common field .

		The characters of hero and heroine , of the fascinating villain Doltaire , whose intrigues cast so sinister a shadow upon their lives , even of such minor figures as Gabord the soldier and Voban the barber , are delineated with an art that rarely weakens ; while the historical portraits of such men as
Bigot	LOCATION	,
Vau	PERSON	- dreuil , and
Wolfe	PERSON	are made equally life-like .

		The story is perhaps a little too crowded with incident especially near the close and invention sometimes goes a trifle too far ; but these are slight defects in what must , on the whole , be reckoned a masterpiece of its kind . ''

		Beyond the Palseocrystic Sea '' is a taking title , but examination of the book does not show Mr.
A. S. Morton	PERSON	, its author , to be possessed of a very remarkable literary gift .

		The story is of a Norse chieftain , forced by the victorious progress of Har - ald Haarf ager to seek a new home for himself and his followers , and finding for that purpose a land far to the North , within the sea that certain explor - ers have imagined to exist about the
North Pole	LOCATION	.

		The story is the ultra-romantic type dear to youth , and is told in the most amateurish way .

		Both sen - timent and language are of the nineteenth century rather than of the ninth .

		The book is prettily printed and bound .

		The unclean sort of fiction that has come to us in so great a volume of recent years , sheltering itself behind such convenient phrases as '' realism , '' '' the return to nature , '' and '' art for art 's sake , '' has evoked many a protest from the moralist ; but pro- tests against any marked tendency in public taste are apt to fall , for the time , upon unheeding ears .

		Such tendencies have to work themselves out , and there are happily in the present case indications of an approaching reaction .

		Better than any set pro- test is such a book as Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's '' Sum - mer in
Arcady	LOCATION	, '' which vindicates for art the right to deal with the most delicate themes , and at the same time shows that the power of suggestiveness may be used for good no less than for evil .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	frankly states that the purpose of his book is to aid in bringing back to literature more whole - some ideals than have seemed of late to dominate the art of fiction-writing , and we should not know where to look for a finer statement of the question at issue than he has put into his brief but weighty preface .

		The words are well worth quoting . ''

		We know them too well these black , chaotic books of the new fiction know what unhealthy suggestions they have courted , what exposures of the eternally hidden they have coarsely made , what ideals of personal depravity they have scattered broadcast , what principles of social order they have attacked , what bases of universal decency they have been resolute to undermine .

		There is hardly a thing of value to the normal portion of the race , in its clean advance toward higher living , that they have not in effect belittled or insulted ; there is scarce a thing that the long experience of the race has condemned and tried to cast off from itself as an element of decay , that they have not set upon with approval and recalled to favour . ''

		Thus runs the indictment , and who shall say that it is over-severe ?

		As for the author 's creative programme , the essential part of it will serve , better than any words of our own , to ex - plain the book under consideration . ''

		It is against this downward-moving fiction of manifold disorder that the writer has ventured to advance a protest under cover of a story a story , he is too well aware , that could not possibly carry with it the weight and measure of an opposing argument , but that should at least contain the taste and quality of healthful repudiation .

		To this end , and with the use of the weapons put into his hands , he has taken two robust 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, young people in the crimson flush of the earliest
summer	DATE	of life ; they are dangerously f oref athered ; they are carelessly reared ; they are temptingly environed ; they are alone with one another and with Nature ; and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, intent on a single aim , directs all her power against their weakness .

		The writer has thus endeavored to charge this story with as much peril as may be found in any of the others even more ; he has ventured to lay bare some of the veiled and sacred mysteries of life with no less frankness than they have used , but using , as he hopes , full and far greater reverence ; and , never - theless , from such a situation he has tried to wrest a moral victory for each of the characters , a victory for the old established order of civilized societies , and a victory for those forces of life that hold within themselves the only hope of the perpetuity of the race and the beauty of the world . ''

		These noble words have the ring of absolute truth and sincerity ; there is nothing worth saying of the book that they do not convey except a few words of tribute to the beauty of its style , and to the warmth and vivid - ness with which it depicts the passion of the South - ern
summer	DATE	landscape .

		For the material element of the tale is not neglected on behalf of the spiritual , and the glow of the one enhances the radiance of the other . ''

		The Quicksands of Pactolus '' is a capital story , and it comes from a region that has not furnished good fiction in proportion to its possibilities .


Cal	LOCATION	- ifornia is known to the novel-reader through the work of Mr.
Harte	PERSON	, but that is about all .

		Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	, who now enters the field , has given us a picture of the intense commercial life of the
Pacific Slope	LOCATION	, of its unscrupulously acquired fortunes , its crudities , its excesses , and the promise of its new generation .

		The book is well put together , crammed with incident , and animated from first to last .

		The treatment borders at times , perhaps , rather too closely on the melodramatic to be wholly commend - able , and the coloring is often harsh ; but a fine ideal of conduct informs the work , imparting to it a strength that is not unmixed with sweetness .

		Readers of Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's earlier novels , and particularly of '' Little
Lord Fauntleroy	PERSON	, '' will rub their eyes before going very far in the story of `` A Lady of Quality . ''

		A stronger contrast could not well be imagined than that which exists between the exasperating little prig who figures in the one book , and the superb creature of violent passions who is the heroine of the other .

		The new story is a romance of the time of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, and attempts , not very successfully , to depict the manners of that period .

		The stilted phraseology of the narrative will probably delude careless readers into thinking that Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	has succeeded in reproducing the form and pressure of a bygone age , but a more dis - criminating judgment will find an almost complete lack of the finer touches so necessary to the success - ful execution of such a task , and will be forced to pronounce the performance crude and the method coarse .

		The author 's conception of her heroine is certainly bold , and the work has a vitality so abounding as to atone in part for its lack of sub - tlety .

		But the interest never grows deep , and the passion never seems wholly genuine .

		The manner of the work is theatrical rather than dramatic in the finer sense , and the stage mechanism is not skil - fully concealed .

		A little old-fashioned in style and treatment , and all the better for being so , the new novel with which Mrs.
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	has broken her long silence brings a sense of refreshment to readers steeped in the feverish literary fashion of the time .

		The story of '' Doctor
Warwick	PERSON	's Daughters '' is one of strictly domestic interest , and its charm is un - failing , although the grasp of character seems un - certain , and the leading conclusions are not as dis - tinctly foregone as they should be in the most artistic fiction .

		The fine things about the book are its elevated and wholesome moral sentiment , its study of society in a provincial town , and its re - markable success in adopting the
Southern	LOCATION	point of view when the scene is for a time transferred to a
Louisiana	LOCATION	plantation .

		These things are quite enough to make the book one of the best of the season , and no one will be likely to suffer disappointment who includes it in the course of fiction laid out for the
summer	DATE	.

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Origin and ^ - n interesting subject has been development touched by Mr.
Charles A. Witchell	PERSON	of bird-song * .

		i n The Evolution of Bird-Song '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and one not hitherto treated in a sys - tematic manner by any ornithologist .

		The author , one of the faithful and indefatigable corps of En - glish men of science , has pursued his special line of investigations for nearly fifteen years , chiefly among British birds ; but birds are birds the wide world over , and serve as favorably for the illustration of a theory in one quarter of the globe as in another .

		Mr.
Witchell	PERSON	attacks his subject at the very founda - tion , beginning with the origin of the voice , which he believes to have been slowly developed from a toneless puffing expressive of anger and induced by the passion and struggle of combat .

		All life was mute during the long ages preceding the evolution of the higher vertebrates , the birds and mammals .

		Then out of a puff or a hiss arose a vocal sound , a battle-cry , which , valuable as a danger-signal , was adopted with varied intonations by the different spe - cies .

		Out of the alarm-cry grew the call-note , the salutation between individuals , the recognition of kinship , the appeal of the social instinct .

		Gradually the call-notes of birds were linked together in simple songs beyond which many of the species have not yet passed in their tuneful utterances .

		The cries of alarm and defiance , characteristic of a race or a species , are , according to Mr.
Witchell	PERSON	, inherited .

		Even the chick in the egg , pecking at the shell for

		release from its prison and peeping audibly mean - while , will cease movement and sound at the alarm - cry of its parent , and wait for a note of assurance before resuming its efforts .

		The perfected song of the bird is , on the other hand , the result of imita - tion .

		It is learned in the nest .

		While the helpless youngling is still naked and blind , it hears and re - members for repetition the language of love poured forth near and continuously by the being which cherishes and sustains it .

		Only the small birds sing , those that are arboreal in habit ; for , protected by their diminutive size and the leafy coverts in which they hide , they may dare speak their happiness in strains loud and prolonged .

		The larger birds are silent from fear of attracting fatal attention , from the necessity of stealth in seeking their prey , from the lethargy which follows the strain of conquest , and from the habit of feeding to repletion .

		Birds must have leisure to sing , as well as vivacity of dis - position .

		Captives in cages sing not only in the hope of calling a mate to relieve their loneliness , but because they have nothing else to do .

		These few points from Mr. WitchelPs argument give but a hint of the suggestiveness of a book which in de - tail and construction is a genuine contribution to the science of ornithology .

		Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	has re-written his '' Life of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	, '' which has continued to be the standard life of
Sterne	PERSON	since its first appearance , in spite of a later attempt by Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	.

		In its new form -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , it is even more likely to retain its supremacy , since Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	has added a considerable amount of new material , some of which is very important to a true estimate of
Sterne	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		The author prints for the first time some curious notes taken from one of the school - books used by
Sterne	PERSON	at
Halifax	LOCATION	; a lengthy letter written by
Sterne	PERSON	to his unfriendly uncle , which seems to entirely exonerate
Sterne	PERSON	from the charge of neglecting his needy mother ; some extracts from a journal written for the famous ''
Eliza	PERSON	, '' together with other letters of varying values .

		Furthermore , Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	has found it necessary to change his entire attitude toward
Sterne	PERSON	. ''

		I have been obliged , '' he says , `` to modify the too favorable opinion I entertained of
Sterne	PERSON	's life and character , and am constrained to admit that Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	's view harsh as it may seem had much to sup - port it .

		Yorick 's Journal , which I have read through carefully , is fatally damaging ; exhibiting a repul - sive combination of Pharisaical utterances and lax principle .

		This would seem to show that Mr.
Sterne	PERSON	was something more than the mere ' philanderer ' he described himself to be .

		Mr.
Elwin	PERSON	was long ago constrained to adopt the same view .

		Indeed , it may be always fairly presumed that licentious writ - ing is almost certain to be followed by life and practice as licentious . ''

		The author thinks that all attempts at comparing and contrasting
Sterne	PERSON	's methods of writing with those of men like Rabelais , Swift , and Fielding , is futile , because he '' was so capricious and even fragmentary and disorderly in his system that comparison is impossible . ''

		He frankly admits that
Sterne	PERSON	'' often wrote what was sheer nonsense to fill his volumes , '' but contends that
Sterne	PERSON	's fame rests upon his character creations , the best of which are '' My Uncle Toby '' and '' Mr.
Shandy	PERSON	'' ; indeed , he even prefers the latter to the former , as being '' more piquant and attractive ... because more original and more difficult to touch . ''

		Although Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	does not pretend to give a critical study of
Sterne	PERSON	's works , many illustrative comments on passages in '' Tristram Shandy '' and '' The Sentimental Journal '' are to be found in his volumes .

		He has succeeded admirably in his attempt to rehabilitate
Sterne	PERSON	.


Sterne	PERSON	's social successes in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, the most characteristic features of his life , form the subjects of the most interesting chapters ; the last of these contains an account of
Sterne	ORGANIZATION	's pathetic death .

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	is always impartial ; he shows sympathy to his hero where sympathy is possible , and severity where severity is necessary .

		There is a portrait of
Sterne	PERSON	in the first volume ; the '' Abstract of Contents '' in the second volume , however , is not as serviceable as a good index .

		The longest and most eventful com - ed y in the 8tor y f En * land is the one played in the sixteenth century with
Queen Elizabeth	PERSON	as the leading lady .

		The va - rious attempts to persuade the '' Virgin Queen '' to abandon her much-boasted celibacy furnish the mo - tive of the plot , and her dextrous juggling through a long course of twenty-four years is unexampled in the history of government .

		The elaborate pre - tence of marriage negotiations was , throughout
Elizabeth	PERSON	's life , her great card , and always ready to be played in the interests of
England	LOCATION	.

		There - fore , the volume by Mr.
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	, called '' The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though less a book of sentiment than of statecraft , is nevertheless both as interesting as a novel and as instructive as new facts and trained powers in col - lecting and presenting them can make it .

		That the making of
England	LOCATION	, and the establishment of Prot - estantism as a permanent power in
Europe	LOCATION	, were due mainly to the coldness , astuteness , and activity of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, at the critical turning-point of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean history , has long been generally admitted ; but how masterly her policy was , and how entirely per - sonal to herself , has perhaps never been so plainly exhibited as in this book .

		Indeed , it is more than probable that she deceived
Cecil	PERSON	and the rest of her advisers as to her matrimonial intentions as com - pletely as she did the suitors themselves , and that except perhaps on two occasions she never really meant to marry .

		In very many cases , neither the wooer nor the wooed was in earnest , and the courtship was merely a polite fiction to cover other objects ; yet to the end of her days she was able painted old jezebel though she was to act coquettishly the part 22 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Capricious , even friv - olous , as the Queen 's methods were , her main ob - ject to play off
France	LOCATION	against
Spain	LOCATION	, and to hold the balance of peace and war in
Europe	LOCATION	in her own hands was rarely neglected or lost sight of .

		To this end , her matrimonial negotiations were only a means ; and the 340 pages of Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's hand - some octavo are none too many to tell the story of the colossal vanity which set up a tradition of per - ennial beauty and decreed that most of the great men of
England	LOCATION	's richest period of greatness should bow their
august	DATE	heads before it and accept it as a part of the national faith .

		Five portraits of the leading characters are presented
Queen Elizabeth	PERSON	,
Lord Seymour	PERSON	,
Earl of Leicester	LOCATION	,
Duke of Anjou	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		, and
Duke of Alengon	ORGANIZATION	; and the index and footnotes show the author 's extensive and scholarly research .

		Mr.
Henry Lauren Clinton	PERSON	's book of '' Extraordinary Cases '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- comprises sketches of certain historic causes celebres , in many of which the author , a dis - tinguished member of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , was en - gaged as counsel .

		The cases of

Henri Carnal	PERSON	,

Mortimer Shay	PERSON	,
Moses Low	PERSON	- enberg , the Forrest divorce case , the
Lemmon	PERSON	slave case , the
Jumel	PERSON	case , and the case of
Millspaugh vs. Adams	PERSON	, are among the noted ones cited .

		The au - thor 's treatment is naturally and properly profes - sional and technical rather than literary ; legal de - tails and the subtle and ingenious -LRB- if sometimes sufficiently puerile and pettifogging -RRB- shifts and dodges of warring counsel forming the substance of the narrative .

		The book is intelligibly written , how - ever , and there is a leaven of anecdotes of judges , lawyers , journalists , and men noted or notorious such as that peculiarly pestiferous blackguard , ''
Mike '' Walsh	PERSON	, for whom the author cherishes rather more than a sneaking regard .

		``
Mike '' Walsh	PERSON	, political trickster , libeller , mob-orator , leader of one of the worst gangs of political '' thugs '' that ever cursed
New York	LOCATION	, after a long career of pic - turesque and successful rascality ended a '' spree '' by falling down an area and fracturing his skull greatly to the relief of most decent people .

		The public , thinks Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	, somewhat unaccount - ably , '' could have better spared a better man . ''

		To our notion , the cynical complacency with which the American public too often regard the prosperous knavery of such characters as ''
Mike '' Walsh	PERSON	is one of the most disquieting and ominous signs of the times that political prophets have to reckon with .

		The extraordinary spectacle of bodies of taxpayers year after year regarding with amused admiration the forays on the public purse of this or that polit - ical cateran , is one , we believe , offered in no country but our own .

		The `` smart '' man is the object of the great national cult ; and it really seems to make very little difference when the '' smartness '' consists merely in so stealing as to avoid the legal penalty for the act .

		Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	's book presents many inter - esting points of practice and examples of skill in legal fence , and should be greatly relished by mem - bers of the profession .

		Mr.
Bain	PERSON	is evidently master of his subject , and of the historical period in which
Charles	PERSON	played his strange part ; and in his volume , though it is unpretending and free from the impedimenta of scholarship , he carries along with him the judgment of the reader by his fairness and critical ability .

		This volume sup - plies all that the general reader will care to know of this meteoric genius , and traces clearly his influ - ence upon his unhappy country and her neighbors .

		The character of
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		is one of the strangest that all history discloses to us , and it does not need the dramatic fictions of Voltaire to make the '' Lion of the North '' an attractive object for speculation and study .

		These fictions Mr.
Bain	PERSON	clears away .

		Charles is shown to have possessed astonishing mil - itary genius , keen insight into political conditions , and many of the personal virtues that become a king .

		The chief defects in his character defects that made his early successes end in dismal failure , and inflicted upon

		With his obstinacy , there was a proud self-sufficiency that led him to refuse the most advantageous offers and rush on in his blind race to deserved failure .

		Yet he was able to keep
Sweden	LOCATION	, poor and sparsely populated , in the rank of great powers , and to make the greatest of these powers suitors for his favor .

		49 THE UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		The youngest of the great universities has at last grown old enough to have a special cele - bration in commemoration of a rounded period of its existence .

		The period is only a lustrum , to be sure , and matters had to be stretched a little to justify even a quinquennial celebration , but if we add to the four years that the Uni - versity has been in running order the prelim - inary year of building and organization , we get the full tale of five .

		For the first time in the history of the institution , also , there was grad - uated a class of students who had taken four years ' work in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and this fact was in itself sufficient justification for a little extra ceremony .

		The programme for
Convocation Week	ORGANIZATION	was one of varied interest .

		A great tent was put up on the campus for the larger gatherings of spectators , and a still greater one would have been filled had it been provided .

		The Convo - cation orator was Dr.
George Adam Smith	PERSON	, of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and his address was one of the ablest to which the
University	ORGANIZATION	has ever had the pleas - ure of listening .

		The formal opening of the
Haskell Oriental Museum	ORGANIZATION	was one of the leading events of the week , and was made the occasion of an eloquent address by Dr.
Emil G. Hirsch	PERSON	; of a representation of the synagogue service of the times of Christ , conducted in the Hebrew tongue and in Oriental costume by the Semitic Department ; and of special conferences on Oriental subjects , with addresses by Dr.
D. G. Lyon	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, and Dr.
A. V. Williams Jackson	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the completed
Oriental Museum	ORGANIZATION	was thus dedicated , the cor - ner stones were being laid of the
Hull Biolog	PERSON	- ical Laboratories , four in number -LRB- zoology , botany , physiology , and anatomy -RRB- , and the prin - cipal address upon this occasion was made by Professor
George L. Goodale	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	.

		The celebration ended on the
Fourth of July	DATE	, with the formal presentation of a
United States	LOCATION	flag , the gift of the
First Kegiment of Illinois Infan	ORGANIZATION	- try to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, by Colonel
Henry L. Turner	PERSON	, and with a scholarly oration on '' The Conditions and Prospects of Democracy , '' de - livered by Professor
Bernard Moses	PERSON	of the 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		This oration was of the sort that jingo newspapers call pessimistic , which means that it was a serious and sober discussion of the grave problem with which it dealt the kind of thing , in short , of which our excitable young men and women , with their tendency to the display of an unbalanced en - thusiasm , are most in need .

		An interesting incidental feature of this quinquennial celebration was provided by the presence of the founder of the institution .

		Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	had often been urged to make a personal inspection of the
University	ORGANIZATION	which his munificence has brought into existence , but had hitherto declined all such invitations .

		At last , however , he consented to come , and it need hardly be said that the reception accorded him was of the most enthusiastic nature .

		He marched in the Convocation Procession , and sat in the tent during the programme of exer - cises , listening , among other things , to the Presi - dent 's airy enumeration of the millions that were still wanted to meet the more pressing needs of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was even pre - vailed upon to make a few remarks of his own , and scored one very neat point upon his audi - ence .

		Enthusiasm rose to a frantic pitch when he casually remarked , '' This is only a begin - ning , '' and promptly subsided with the conclu - sion of the sentence , '' You will do the rest . ''

		But he must have taken peculiar satisfaction in viewing the noble group of buildings , and the imposing group of men and women in scholastic garb , resulting , for the most part , from his gen - erous initiative , and all testifying to the power for good that it rests with a man of wealth to exercise .

		So young a university could not fail , upon a festal occasion like this , to exhibit startling contrasts .

		The newness of the institution , as exemplified by the unfinished condition of the campus , the makeshift tent erected for the cele - bration , the brass band requisitioned for the purpose , and the restive self-consciousness of the men in their unaccustomed raiment , was as apparent as , let us say , the newness of the Ger - man Empire to a sojourner in
Berlin	LOCATION	during the seventies .

		Neither an empire nor a univer - sity , with the stamp of the mint still sharply impressed upon it , can put on the trappings and the suits of antiquity and feel wholly at ease , or so wear them as not to arouse in the philosophical observer some sense of incon - gruity or imperfect adjustment .

		To see the youngest of universities thus trying to outdo the oldest in the matter of form and ceremonial , particularly under such distressing external conditions as obtain at
Chicago	LOCATION	, is a matter for solemn reflection ; and the sight would give pause to Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, making him wonder at the vitality of the ceremonial in - stinct .

		The very forms and symbols that are so impressive when they are really survivals , and consecrated by the unbroken tradition of centuries , become little more than childish toys when they are deliberately assumed for the sake of the dignity imagined to go with them , and thus fail in large measure of the effect desiderated .

		The true dignity of a university is not to be sought in features which , even if cherished upon historical grounds , are still only incidental to its life .

		The spirit of the institution , and the seriousness of the aims which it pursues , are the real index of its significance .

		The Univer - sity of
Chicago	LOCATION	has shown , as the Johns Hop - kins
University	ORGANIZATION	showed twenty years earlier , that age is not essential to an educational insti - tution of the highest type .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is to-day a great influence for good , because , with large property and substantial equipment , it enlists the services of a distin - guished body of scholars in its teaching , and attracts to its walls a great number of earnest young people in search of culture .

		It is also a power for good because it has espoused a large conception of the university ideal , its tentacles reaching out to all classes of the community in which it has taken up its work .

		We think of the octopus as a malignant and destructive creature , but there is no reason why the name should bear associations of this kind alone .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, with its systems of extension - work and correspondence - teaching , its efforts to raise the standards of lower edu - cation throughout the surrounding country , its cooperation with the work of public and pri - vate schools , its public lectures and expanding press , its missionary work done in settlements and experimental schools of pedagogy , is fas - tening itself with clear-sighted and beneficent energy upon the civic life of the community with which it is associated , and in calling it an octopus we do no violence to correct metaphor .

		That its reach may become greater and its grasp more firm with every year of its life must be the wish of everyone who has at heart the inter - ests of culture and civilization .

		It is , indeed , as the founder remarked , only a beginning that has thus far been made , but it is a good be - ginning , and one that promises much for the future .

VANCE CHENEY	PERSON	.

		LITERARY CRITICS AND LITERARY CRITICISM .

		What is literary excellence ?

		To whom shall we look with respect and confidence as conservators of all that is best in contemporaneous literature ?

		If the foregoing questions are answered comprehen - sively , we shall meet satisfactory definitions of the true literary critic , and of painstaking and conscien - tious criticism .

		Undoubtedly , a just criticism is the intelligent expression of a just literary judgment .

		Fulsome praise and biting sarcasm are no part of the language of a critical judgment .

		These quali - ties may come from the smallest and the narrowest of intellects , and are usually worthless in the world of letters .

		They absorb the prejudices and eccen - tricities of their environment , and put into definite literary form the baser feelings of the human mind .

		They do not seek the pure atmosphere of the higher life .

		They invest in none of the lofty sentiments which befit the true man .

		The critic of contemporaneous literature must be in touch with his age .

		It will not be enough for him simply to know a truth when he sees it .

		He must also know the conditions which have evolved the truth , or have made such evolution possible .

		He must be able to judge relatively as well as abstractly .

		His success will largely depend upon his ability to grasp present-day problems as they are presented for his clearer literary vision .

		It is not necessary for him to take a position in the clouds in order that nothing of an earthly nature should obscure his view .

		Rather let him stand among his fellows , in order the better to catch the inspiration of the hour , and to form an intelligent estimate from that point of view , so essential and so indispensable to the true critic of contemporaneous literature .

		Literary excellence must prevail whenever and wherever criticism is taken out of the wallowing mire of literary mediocrity and commonplace , and transferred into the pure and clear air of a broad and generous culture , of a lofty ideal , and of intelli - gent and just literary opinions .

		Literature seeks to secure and retain the approval of those high-minded persons whose judgment is founded in reason and justice , who delight to see real literary merit reach the heights of enduring fame .

		So , too , literature desires that the literary sycophant who praises with - out reason , and the literary cynic who condemns without justice , should alike be held up to public scorn , ridicule , and abhorrence .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	says , in your issue of
June 16	DATE	, that of five quotations in my article on '' Shakespeare in
Lexi	LOCATION	- cography , '' two are incorrectly given -LRB- though this is not what he means -RRB- , '' the passage from Cymbeline ' being from the third instead of the fourth scence of the first act , and the same being true of the extract from Meas - ure for Measure . ' ''

		The first of these two passages is in the third scene in the Riverside -LRB- White 's -RRB- Shake - speare , but in the fourth scene in the Leopold edition , and the other is in the fourth scene in both these edi - tions .

		Another critic thinks a knowledge of
Schmidt	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare Lexicon '' would have prepared me for a more intelligent discussion of the vocabulary of Shake - speare , and is surprised to see such an article as mine with no mention of that lexicon .

		My article was just what it was meant to be , and reference to
Schmidt	PERSON	was not needed .

		I know his work well enough to assent un - reservedly to my critic 's estimate of it .

		It may be pos - sible that '' great '' in '' of great admittance '' meant '' great people , '' but this merely shifts the ellipsis .

		`` Ad - mittance '' certainly means what I and
Schmidt	PERSON	and my critic say it means , whether the ellipsis be before or after it , which is uncertain .

		Timon 's apostrophe is cited in favor of '' that which separates '' as a meaning of divorce '' O thou sweet king-killer , and dear divorce . ''

		Is this not metonymic or elliptical for '' dear instrument of divorce , '' and is not the real sense of the word that which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had in mind ?

		I still believe it is , and that it is not advisable to define an effect as a cause .

		* Historical students will find in the
Paget Papers	ORGANIZATION	useful clews to the tangled skein of Con - tinental politics during the changeful period extending from a little before the
fall	DATE	of Robes - pierre ,
July 27 , 1794	DATE	, down to some four months after the Peace of Tilsit ,
July 7 , 1807	DATE	.

		The volumes contain the diplomatic correspond - ence of Sir
Arthur Paget	PERSON	, edited by his son , Sir
Augustus B. Paget	PERSON	, who supplies a brief sketch of his father 's public career , together with some elucidatory matter , historical and personal .

		Sir
Arthur Paget	PERSON	played a promi - nent part in the shifting political drama of which
Bonaparte	PERSON	was the protagonist .

		One of the ablest diplomatists of his time , he was ac - tively engaged during the period covered by the correspondence in guarding English inter - ests at such centres as
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Munich	LOCATION	,
Vienna	LOCATION	, and
Palermo	LOCATION	; and his letters present a pretty continuous record of the development of affairs as seen through British eyes intensely British ones , be it added , for it is clear throughout that no Briton was ever more firmly fixed in the national faith that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, in forming the En - glishman , had fairly outdone herself and out - stripped her own ideal , than was Sir
Arthur Paget	PERSON	.

		As his son gravely puts it , '' No one was ever more earnestly impressed with the superiority of British institutions over those of any other nation , or more thoroughly appre - ciated the privilege of having been born an Englishman ... than Sir
A. Paget	PERSON	. ''

		Sir
Arthur Paget	PERSON	, third son of Henry -LRB-
Bayly	PERSON	-RRB-
Paget	PERSON	, who was in
1784	DATE	by Patent created
Earl	PERSON	of
Uxbridge	LOCATION	, was born
January 15 , 1771	DATE	, and died
July 26 , 1840	DATE	.

		He was educated at
Westminster School	ORGANIZATION	a rather severe ordeal , as we gather from the following : '' Those were rough days for boys at public schools , the system of tyranny and bullying of the small boys by their seniors having been frequently revolting and atro - cious .

		I remember my father mentioning that his brother
Edward	PERSON	had undergone such a thrashing from one of the bigger boys that it was for some time doubt - ful whether he would recover from the injuries inflicted upon him , but that he absolutely refused , either at the time or afterwards , to reveal the name of his assailant . ''

		From Westminster Sir
Arthur	PERSON	went to
Christ Church College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, whence he proceeded in
1790	DATE	to the Continent , with the view of learn - ing foreign languages , and of otherwise equip - ping himself for the diplomatic profession .

		A letter written to him at this period by Lord
Henry Fitzgerald	PERSON	, brother of Lord
Robert Fitzgerald	PERSON	who was then secretary of the Em - bassy at
Paris	LOCATION	, touches interestingly on current events at the French capital . ''

		All has been confusion again at
Paris	LOCATION	, owing to the folly of the poor
King	PERSON	, who took the
Sacrament Easter	ORGANIZATION
Sunday	DATE	from one of the nonjuring clergy all the heads of which he has harbored and protected in his palace .

		This instantly gave a general alarm , and the cry was that the
King	PERSON	had deserted his people , et qu'il etait devenu aristocrat , that his conduct was insincere .

		In such a ferment was all
Paris	LOCATION	that the King attempted to go to
St. Cloud	ORGANIZATION	, and was actually in the carriage with the Queen .

		He was prevented by the mob , and sat in his carriage two hours determined not to get out .

		Upon this La Fayette told him he could not answer for any - thing unless the
King	ORGANIZATION	ordered him with the militia of
Paris	LOCATION	to fire .

		This the
King	PERSON	would not hear of , and La Fayette was told by his soldiers in plain terms that they would not obey any such order , supposing it had been given .

		The Queen attempted to harangue the mob , when she was saluted with , ' Tais-toi , coquine , ce n'est pas a toi de donner des ordres id ! '

		La Fayette , enraged , resigned , and the King was obliged to give up the jour - ney .

		The next day he went to the Assembly , made a fine speech , but has not quite regained the confidence hitherto reposed in him of his being a friend of the Revolution though he has discarded all the nonjuring clergymen and aristocratic officers of his household .

		This transaction , foolish on his part , and really out - rageous on the part of the people , has cost the Royal Family , my brother says , many tears and dreadful mo - ments of anxiety . ''

		Late in
1791	DATE	, or early in
1792	DATE	, Sir
Arthur	PERSON	was temporarily employed in Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	's Mis - sion at
Berlin	LOCATION	, whence he was presently trans - ferred to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	as Secretary of Lega - tion under Lord
Whitworth	PERSON	.

		In
1794	DATE	he returned to
Berlin	LOCATION	, where he acted for several months as Charge d'affaires during the absence of the temporary envoy ,
Lord Malmesbury	LOCATION	.

		A letter of this date from Mr.
Paget	PERSON	to Lord
St. Helens	LOCATION	, Ambassador at the
Hague	LOCATION	, regarding the proposed marriage between the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	-LRB- afterwards George IV . -RRB-

		and
Caroline	PERSON	of
Brunswick	LOCATION	, may be quoted as showing the promising perspicacity and initiative of the young diplomatist -LRB- he was then twenty-three -RRB- , who evidently used all his address to prevent the ill-starred match .

		After some cautious pre - liminary fencing , Mr.
Paget	PERSON	goes on to say : '' I will not conceal from you then , My Lord , that this intelligence -LSB- of the impending treaty of marriage -RSB- has given me the most serious uneasiness , and it is palpable that the choice which -LRB- it appears -RRB- has been made is the cause of it .

		I will not now take upon me to mention who
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 have been the promoters of this union , but this I will venture to say , that it has been undertaken by persons , who have had an interest , not perhaps in making this particular choice , but in preventing its having fallen elsewhere .

		Obvious reasons point out the necessity of not committing to paper the received character of the Princess -LRB-
Caroline	PERSON	-RRB- above alluded to , and I am sure that your lordship is too well acquainted with it to make that necessary .

		I can not , however , avoid saying this much , that I conceive it to be more calculated to ensure the misery of the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, than promote his happiness , and at a future period the nation 's welfare . ''

		Concluding , Mr.
Paget	PERSON	-LRB- forgetful evidently of the precept touching the casting of pearls be - fore swine -RRB- takes upon himself to suggest a bride worthier of the chaste patron of
Beau Brummell	ORGANIZATION	and putative husband of Mrs.
Fitz	PERSON	- herbert , than the shady
Caroline	PERSON	of Brunswick : '' It will immediately occur to your lordship that the Princess I allude to is the
Princess Louisa	LOCATION	of
Prussia	LOCATION	a woman in every respect worthy of so great an alliance , inferior to few as to the beauties of her person , and endowed with an understanding which in every scene of life is calculated to distinguish her ... What I have said will sufficiently prove my entire aversion to this projected marriage , and if I could flatter myself that it would appear to you in the same point of view , I should feel perfectly secure that the representations you may have it in your power to make upon the subject would be attended with the success they deserve ... '' Unfortunately , Mr.
Paget	PERSON	's wise interposition came too late .

E. G. J. GLEANINGS	PERSON	IN AMERICAN FOLK LOBE .

		* Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's book on '' Current
Supersti	PERSON	- tions '' is the fourth volume of the '' Memoirs of the American Folk - Lore Society . ''

		Quaint expressions , terse sayings , curious superstitions , apparently unmeaning practices of the past , linger tenaciously , even into the busy present of bustling
America	LOCATION	.

		No intelligent reader is so far removed from them as not to find inter - est in hearing the old ideas expressed again .

		We all heard signs and knew charms and tried '' projects '' when we were young , and to be reminded of them is refreshing .

		This interest * CURRENT SUPERSTITIONS .

		Collected from the
Oral Tra	ORGANIZATION	- dition of English-Speaking Folk .

		Edited by
Fanny D. Ber	PERSON	- gen , with Notes and an Introduction by
William Wells Newell	PERSON	.

		and refreshment will be all that many readers will derive from '' Current Superstitions '' ; to the student , however , will come much more .

		For him there are here bits of past philosophy , much of savage psychology , shreds of rude reli - gious belief .

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	does not pretend to have ex - hausted the material .

		The book can make no claim to fulness .

		A rich collection of plant and animal lore is reserved for another publication .

		But even of the kind of material presented , we have but a fraction .

		The public will be disap - pointed in its small amount ; but it is well that the collection is published now and in its incom - plete state .

		The material is fairly varied ; Mr.
Newell	PERSON	's introduction is suggestive ; the matter is carefully classified and arranged .

		While Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	might have been gratified by the delay in publication until double the amount of material had been secured , the appearance of the book in its present form will probably call out four or five times its mass for future use .

		Each item is numbered .

		Fourteen hundred and seventy-five numbers are presented .

		Many of them are simply local variants of others .

		While the book aims to be English lore , some German and negro superstitions appear .

		If we suppress slightly differing variants and this foreign matter we reduce the bulk probably by one-half .

		It seems as if it would have been better not to separately number each variant of a theme , as if it were a really new idea ; of course all variants should be presented , but they should hardly be given the prominence of independent themes .

		The presentation of '' projects '' is well done . ''

		Projects '' are the popular attempts to divine the future .

		While '' now made in a sportive manner and only with partial belief , '' they are real broken-down remnants of once serious cer - emonies .

		Naming apple-seeds and counting them out to find the future is wide-spread .

		No. 170 describes a curious project tried in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	which is quite like Cherokee bead-conjuring . ''

		An apple seed was placed on each of the four fingers of the right hand .

		They were named , and the fingers so worked as to move slightly .

		The seed that stayed on longest indicated the name of your future hus - band . ''

		A sport among white people , such con - juring is in earnest among the
Cherokees	LOCATION	.

		To count buttons for one 's fortune is child 's play , but until recently an important Christian de - nomination left all important decisions to the lot .

		No. 241 runs : '' Write names on three pieces of paper , throw them up in the air -LRB- in
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 the dark -RRB- ; feel for one , put it under the pillow , and in the morning look for the name of the man you are going to marry . ''

		Ridiculous , but the great
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is said to have left a life deci - sion to the fall of a knife .

		School children often write two names , one of a boy and one of a girl , upon paper and then cancel the letters common to them ; those left are counted out with the words '' love , friendship , indifference , hate -LRB- cf. 244 -RRB- , to find the feeling existing be - tween the two parties .

		Underneath this there must lie a queer mixture of ideas among which must be these two belief in beings destined for each other , conception of mystic power in names .

		The world will ever judge men by appear - ances .

		To physiognomize is natural .

		The child with some unfortunate characteristic will be noted and some comment made . ''

		Give a dog a bad name and hang him . ''

		The comment or the prediction based upon the peculiarity is likely to be justified .

		The poor child , from nagging , constant repetition of the unpleasant saw , and the popular disfavor , has much against him .

		Fortunately sufficient difference , in the meanings attributed to such peculiarities , exists to rob these signs of much of their bad result .

		Thus while small ears show stinginess , they also indicate truthfulness . ''

		If the eyebrows meet , one is ill-tempered . ''

		This peculiarity is so generally connected with unreasoning dislike that its presence is a real misfortune .

		What inducement has a superstitious mother to care properly for the poor babe whose blue-veined forehead destines it to early death ?

		Red-haired people , no matter how amiable naturally , are likely to become fiery-tempered .

		Popular ob - servation is keen face , features , hair , hand , foot , beauty-spots , wrinkles , dimples , all are mercilessly noticed ; all have meaning .

		Care - ful study only can separate what is really true in folk physiognomy from what is resultant to belief and what is purely superstitious .

		Faith in amulets is by no means dead among us .

		Metals cure ; gold is good for throat troubles , brass for rheumatism .

		The doctrine of signatures a forerunner of the homoeopathic dogma that like cures like , and a phase of sym - pathetic magic often appears .

		Thus for nose - bleed red beads should be worn ; blood is red , the beads must be so .

		Popular cures , through some formula to be repeated or by some simple practice to be observed , are numerous .

		In some cases such cures may really be expected .

		Thus -LRB- No. 855 -RRB- , to cure nose-bleed chew brown paper .

		To cure side-ache after running , boys often spit on a stone , place the wet side down - ward on the ground and put the foot of the affected side thereon -LRB- cf. No. 100 -RRB- .

		Both of these remedies are often efficient .

		The ques - tion in all such '' cures '' is just how the action comes .

		In the first of these cases there may be a real physical result , actually due to the prac - tice ; in the other the result is probably due to superstition , it is a case of mind acting on body , expectancy overcoming a physical condition .

		It would be a good piece of work for someone to analyze these popular '' cures '' into three groups one reasonable , based on real physical opera - tions , the second explainable as mind-cures , the third clearly superstition or magic .

		The whole subject of warts is suggestive .

		Popular belief explains their appearance by sympathetic magic .

		To milk a cow with a warty bag , to touch blood from a wart to the tongue , to touch irregular knobby growths on trees , to handle a toad , to touch certain toadstools , all these may cause warts .

		Things so uncanny in origin must be treated by magic .

		The means used may or may not transfer them to some other victim . ''

		Find an old bone in the field , rub the wart with it , then lay it down exactly as you found it . '' ''

		Rub a wart with a stolen dish-cloth , and then hide or bury the latter ; as it decays the wart will disappear . ''

		Steal '' pork from the family barrel of salted pork , rub the wart with it and throw it into the road .

		The person who picks it up will get the wart . ''

		The list might be carried far beyond Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's forty - seven remedies .

		Warts are really cured by most of these cures .

		The reviewer has experi - mented upon scores of cases .

		All that is needed to cure warts , which are curiously nervous troubles , is to gain the confidence of the patient in the remedies used .

		Plant-milk , acids , tonics , touching , counting , transfer , all succeed if only the warty victim has faith .

		Most of the superstitions herein discussed are '' pagan '' ; some of them run back to stone - age times .

		When metals came into use and Christianity was established the symbol of the new religion and the objects of the new culture were set against the practices and implements of the ancient faith .

		Iron and the cross are charms against evil .

		Some very simple childish prac - tices no doubt point back to such ideas .

		The sign of the cross , once potent in exorcism , re - mains a guard or charm in play .

		A boy crosses his fingers , elbows , or legs when telling a false - hood to free himself from responsibility , he crosses his breath in asseveration , he draws an X with his mallet in croquet between his ball 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and that of an opponent about to aim to '' cross luck . ''

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	has been one of the first to call attention to certain practices which she claims show former sun-worship .

		They are at least fragments of old ceremonial circuits .

		Among some barbarous people notably among many of our Indian tribes and even among the modern Jews , it makes a profound difference in what direction a circular movement in a re - ligious ceremony is made .

		A set direction must be observed .

		The order affects processionals , movements , distribution of objects , etc. .

		That such ceremonial circuits were once observed by the ancestors of English-speaking peoples is abundantly shown by a considerable series of little superstitions and practices .

		Thus : '' To make good bread stir it with the sun . '' ''

		In cooking soft custard the stirring must be con - tinued throughout in the direction in which it was begun , otherwise the custard will turn to whey . '' ''

		In greasing the wheels of a carriage , always begin at a certain wheel and go round in a set way . '' ''

		In rubbing for rheumatism , etc. , rub from left to right '' -LRB- sunwise -RRB- .

		These observances are uncanny reminders of ancient beliefs .

		It is easy to claim that faith in these old things is past .

		We may not , however , dismiss them too lightly ; faith is terribly persistent .

		Most projects and signs must have failed so often that confidence ought to be rudely shaken .

		But failure in mystic performances rarely makes skeptics ; one success makes up for a thousand miscarriages .

		The most curious thing , however , in some of these superstitions is their currency in spite of the absolutely impossible conditions to be used or ends to be gained .

		Thus , how could this ever have become cur - rent ?

		`` When a person wishes to remove warts from his hand cut as many notches on a stick as you have warts , and standing on a bridge throw the stick over your left shoulder and turn your head ; they will go off before you leave the bridge '' Certain promises are based upon psy - chical impossibilities .

		Children everywhere in the
United States	LOCATION	believe that a tooth of gold will replace a lost tooth , if the cavity left is not touched with the tongue .

		A somewhat similar promise in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	asserts , '' if you cut your finger-nails on a
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	with - out thinking of a red fox 's tail , you will get a present before the week is out . ''

		Such show a keen popular insight into human limitations .

		Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's work is plainly of value to the serious student .

		Casual readers will find in it many reminders of the time when the world was young to them .

		We are sure that we may beg readers to send Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	further ma - terial , which they may recall from their own experience .

		It will be gratefully received and properly used .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's little book , '' What They Say in
New England	LOCATION	, '' covers much the same ground as Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's .

		Its geographical field is more limited , but its literary field is wider .

		In it we find not only current superstitions but counting-out rhymes , tricks and catches , nur - sery tales and '' old stories . ''

		It is all good folk-lore and well told .

		Most of the material is from
Western Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		To institute a fair comparison between the two books , we have numbered the items of current supersti - tion in
Johnson	PERSON	's book , finding more than six hundred and fifty .

		As he gives few variants and not much in plant and animal lore , it ap - pears that he gives nearly as many independ - ent bits as Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	.

		This good gleaning from one part of one state emphasizes our claim that Mrs.
Bergen	PERSON	's collection will be multiplied several times by careful gathering over a wide district .

		THE SOUTHERN QUAKERS AND SLAVERY .

		* Quakerism in
Virginia	LOCATION	, the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, Ten - nessee , and
Georgia	LOCATION	, constitutes the subject of a timely and valuable contribution to American history .

		The Quakers were a migratory peo - ple , and they came to
America	LOCATION	as early as
1656	DATE	.

		They formed a part of the population along the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast , and their numbers so increased that at the
end of the seventeenth century	DATE	they were the largest and only organized body of Dissenters in the
Southern	LOCATION	colonies .

		In the eighteenth century a great wave of migration southward appeared , which had its chief source in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, but was increased by emi - grants from
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, and
Nan	ORGANIZATION	- tucket .

		The fortunes of these people in the South , and their subsequent removal to the States of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	in which they sought a refuge from the evils of slavery , are admirably set forth in this volume .

		They found life a serious business in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		Mr.

		In
July , 1656	DATE	,
Ann Austin	PERSON	and
Mary Fisher	PERSON	, the vanguard of a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	army , appeared in
Boston	LOCATION	from
Barbadoes	LOCATION	.

		They were the first Quakers to arrive in
America	LOCATION	, and they were imprisoned and sent back .

		In
October	DATE	of the same year a law was passed which pro- vided a fine for the ship-master who knowingly brought in
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	, and obliged him to carry them out again .

		The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	was to be whipped , and committed to the house of correction .

		Any person importing books or ' writings concerning their devilish opinions , ' or defend - ing their ' heretical opinions , ' was to be fined , and for the third offense banished .

		The law of
October , 1657	DATE	, imposed a fine for entertaining a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	.

		If a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	returned after being sent away once he was to lose one ear ; if he returned a second time , the other ear ; and the third offense was punished by boring the tongue .

		The law of
October , 1658	DATE	, banished both resident and foreign
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	on pain of death .

		In
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	had their ears cut off ; they were branded ; they were tied to the cart-tail and whipped through the streets ; women were shamefully exposed to public gaze ; and in 1659-60 , three men and one woman were hanged on
Boston Common	ORGANIZATION	such was the welcome of the first Quakers to American soil '' -LRB- pp. 5-6 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	mentions the case of
George Wilson	PERSON	, who visited
Virginia	LOCATION	about the year
1661	DATE	. ''

		He had been imprisoned in
Cumberland	LOCATION	for reprov - ing a priest .

		He had been cast into jail in
Boston	LOCATION	, and was whipped through three towns and banished .

		From Puritan
New England	LOCATION	he turned to
Cavalier Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Here he was cast into a dungeon , very loathsome , with - out light , without ventilation .

		Here , after being cruelly scourged and heavily ironed for a long period ,
George Wilson	PERSON	had to feel the heartlessness of a persecuting and dominant hierarchy ; until at last his flesh actually rotted from his bones , and within the cold damp walls of the miserable dungeon of
Jamestown	LOCATION	, he lay down his life , a faithful martyr for the testimony of Jesus '' -LRB- p. 20 -RRB- .

		An equally revolting case was that of
Mary Tompkins	PERSON	and
Alice Ambrose	PERSON	, who had been engaged in the work of the ministry before coming to
America	LOCATION	.

		On their second visit to
Virginia	LOCATION	, as
Sewall	PERSON	relates the facts , '' They had been pilloried , and each had been whipped with thirty-two stripes , with a whip of nine cords , and every cord with three knots ; and they were handled so severely that the very first lash drew blood and made it run down from their breasts . ''

		They had -LSB- recently experienced the same sort of treatment in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	; '' their goods were then seized , and they were expelled from the colony in
June , 1664	DATE	'' -LRB- pp .

		21 , 22 -RRB- .

		According to a law of
Virginia	LOCATION	known as the Conventicle Act of
1663	DATE	, prohibiting the un - lawful assembling of Quakers , they were for - bidden to worship .

		A minister or a layman could not offer a prayer at the bedside of the dying if there were five grown persons present .

		Dissent from the established religion was re - garded as a social evil , and there was no escape from responsibility save in flight to the estab - lishment -LRB- p. 19 -RRB- .

		The Quakers believed in the rights of conscience and the total separa - tion of Church and State ; but they were com - pelled to pay tithes , and in case of refusal they were collected by distress .

		They were also liable to fine and imprisonment .

		Under such legislation great hardships were endured by Friends in
Virginia	LOCATION	and
North Carolina	LOCATION	, but they were steadfast in their long struggle for relief , which they finally secured .

		Their experience was equally trying in main - taining their testimony against war .

		They refused to take any part in the Indian wars , or to attend private or general musters .

		For such refusal they were fined , and the fine collected by distress .

		They constantly protested against the hardships of these military exactions , which from time to time were modified and mitigated , but never relinquished .

		During the
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary struggle they refused to take any part .

		Some Friends refused to pay the
State	ORGANIZATION	levies for war purposes , and as the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	cur - rency was issued for such purposes many de - clined to receive it .

		This action aided the decline of this money , and gave the influence of the society to the British , but it does not impeach the loyalty of Friends to the American cause ; for no body of people could have been more devotedly attached to their country .

		They had no sympathy with royalty , and were thoroughly democratic in their opinions and policy .

		But their attitude was exceedingly em - barrassing and vexatious .

		They were constantly misunderstood and misrepresented , and they were not spared when the States were invaded , being exposed to the requisitions of the Amer - icans and the thefts and robberies of the British , just as in the late Civil War the Friends in
Virginia	LOCATION	, who occupied territory contended for by both Federal and Confederate troops , were in turn exposed to the ravages of each .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	sets forth in detail their struggle with the civil authorities for the rights of conscience and the extent to which those rights were con - ceded during the Revolution ; and although individual Friends sometimes swerved from their professed principles , and the Society itself was not always entirely consistent , it was faith - ful to its testimonies .

		But
Southern Friends	ORGANIZATION	appear at their best in 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, their dealings with slavery .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	is fairly justified in saying that '' the mission of Quakerism has been to the slave .

		In this strug - gle Quakers appealed to the universal con - science of mankind .

		Here they ceased to be propagandists of faith , and became propagan - dists of action .

		They announced their opposi - tion to the system when it had no other oppo - nents , and they steadfastly maintained their testimony until its last traces were swept from the English-speaking world . ''

		In their earlier career in the South many of them held slaves , and some as late as
1781	DATE	; but as a body they were hostile to the evil from the beginning , and this hostility steadily increased till the owning of a slave was made a disciplinable offense .

		The laws of
Virginia	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	pro- hibiting emancipation were in their way , and against these they labored till the
Virginia	LOCATION	act of
1782	DATE	gave all slave-owners the power to emancipate by will after death , or by acknowl - edging the will while alive in open court , pro- vided they agreed to support all the aged , infirm , and young persons thus set at liberty .

		This law had been defeated the year before by
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
Harrison	PERSON	; and
Robert Pleasants	PERSON	states in his '' Letter Book '' that forty of
Harrison	PERSON	's slaves had gone off with the British , and he intimates that this was a punishment for his opposition to emancipation .

		Friends found an - other obstacle to the work of emancipation in the laws of
Indiana	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	forbidding masters to carry negroes there for the purpose of giving them freedom , and also forbidding negroes already free to migrate thither .

		But they persevered in their work , and in the face of much difficulty succeeded in colonizing many free colored people in the states named .

		Friends who acted as overseers of slaves were disowned .

		They gave constant attention to the aged and helpless among the colored people , and spared no pains in inculcating the duties of thrift and temperance and in supplying them with the means of education .

		It is a noteworthy fact that the
North Carolina	LOCATION	Friends favored the colonization of negroes , and it is still more re - markable that this cunningly devised scheme of imposture and inhumanity which was intended to tighten the chains of the slave and perpet - uate his bondage was at first almost universally favored by the leading Abolitionists of the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		In the earlier stages of the anti-slavery conflict ,
Charles Os	PERSON	- borne was the only man of prominence who comprehended the project and condemned it .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	mentions another remarkable fact , which will surprise many people , namely , that the Friends as a body were opposed to the un - derground railroad .

		It is not easy to see how this opposition could have been very united or earnest , if we bear in mind the great work of
Levi Coffin	ORGANIZATION	and other Friends in shipping fugi - tives to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		In his ninth chapter , page 216 , Mr. Weeks makes a statement which invites comment and correction .

		In speaking of Friends , he says : `` They were not Abolitionists .

		They believed an attempt by the general government to interfere with slavery would cause excitement and alarm .

		The power over slavery , they said , was in the
States	LOCATION	.

		In
1836	DATE	, the Yearly Meeting attributed excitement on the question of slavery to abolition societies , and said that this had raised the people of the
United States	LOCATION	almost as one man against them , and had ' closed the door of useful - ness ' on behalf of the negro .

		They bear witness that the desire to emancipate was becoming more general in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		One of the last things done by the
Virginia	LOCATION	Yearly Meeting is to warn Friends against the extremes of the Abolitionists . ''

		This passage shows how long a baseless fabri - cation , well-launched , can live .

		It must be at least sixty years since the charge was invented that the abolitionists proposed the overthrow of slavery through the action of the general government .

		The Friends believed this in
1836	DATE	, and it is not surprising , for in the frenzied tem - per of the public mind at that time the purpose of the abolition societies was totally misunder - stood .

		They always disclaimed any right on the part of the general government to inter - meddle with slavery in the States , and conceded that the power over it was solely in them .

		This was the position of the old Liberty party , and afterwards of the
Free Soil	ORGANIZATION	and Republican parties .

		It was the position also of the
Garri	PERSON	- sonian abolitionists , who were in favor of a peaceable dissolution of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, because the general government had no right to abolish slavery .

		And neither they nor any other body of anti-slavery men ever asserted any right to interfere with slavery by physical force .

		But in the passage quoted , Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	not only ignores these well-known facts of history and commends the Friends for repudiating a policy which no anti-slavery party ever espoused , but he revives the exploded charge that the aboli - tionists had set back the cause of emancipation .

		We supposed that this accusation had been buried too deep for any possible resurrection .

		It did effective service for the sympathizers with slavery two generations ago , as a pretext for opposing all anti-slavery action ; but its work is done , and if it has any surviving friends they should beg for it the mercy of oblivion .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 In speaking of the divisions and subdivisions of Friends , we think Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	might with propriety have referred to the trouble in the
Whitewater	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, Yearly Meeting in
1842	DATE	, which was caused by the action of that meeting in dealing with
Charles Osborne	PERSON	for his anti- slavery position .

		This meeting represented the largest body of Friends in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		By some means the colonization and conserva - tive element in the body had then gained the ascendency , and abolitionism was regarded as a terror .

		The society had forbidden the use of meeting-houses for anti-slavery lectures , and the joining in anti-slavery organizations with those who did not profess to wait for divine direction .

		It also had advised against anti- slavery publications by Friends , without first submitting them to the examination of a Meet - ing for Sufferings .


Charles Osborne	PERSON	was then a member of the Meeting for Sufferings , and he and seven others refused to obey this unau - thorized prohibitory advice .

		For this action they were degraded from their positions as '' disqualified , '' and their places filled by per - sons who were willing to become the instruments of the Yearly Meeting .

		They were not accused of any unsoundness in doctrine , nor were any formal charges preferred against them .

		They begged that the reasons for this action might be spread upon the minutes of the meeting , as a matter of simple justice to themselves , and in order that they might not stand recorded as transgressors ; but their petition was disre - garded .

		A division in the Society followed , and a new branch , which became known as the Society of Anti-slavery Friends , was organized .

		This action against
Osborne	PERSON	and his associates was taken in
1842	DATE	, at the Yearly Meeting which welcomed to a seat among the ruling elders
Henry Clay	PERSON	, who , in his
Mendenhall	PERSON	speech , the day before , had declared that '' the Society of Friends take the right stand in rela - tion to this subject . ''

		Years afterwards , when the new Fugitive Slave Law , the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , and the struggle to make Kansas a slave State , had revolutionized public opinion , the eyes of these Friends were anointed , and , like other religious bodies , they saw their duties in a new light .

		The '' world , '' on which they turned their backs in
1841	DATE	to avoid its contamination , had at last taught them more wisdom than any divine inpulse had been able to impart .

		But they refused to make any atonement for their conduct in dealing with these brave and faithful men , and insisted that the record of their condemnation should stand .

		The Society was handicapped by its action .

		It owed
Charles Osborne	PERSON	much , morally and spir - itually ; but its love of consistency triumphed over its conscience .

		The facts relating to this transaction have been given to the public , and we think that something more than a mere allu - sion to them would have been appropriate in a history of
Southern Quakers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The truth ought to be told , and no man or party should be allowed to '' escape history . ''

		Perhaps the most interesting portion of this volume is the chapter on ''
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	Social Life . ''

		Their marriages were solemnized according to regulations of the Society , and these frequently involved them in trouble with the civil author - ities , which at first declined to tolerate their peculiarities .

		Friends were not allowed to in - termarry with people outside their own body , and disownment was the penalty for violating this requirement .

		Second marriages were not permitted in less than one year ; but the
Caro	PERSON	- lina Friends considered this period too long , and reduced it to nine months .

		Friends were warned against costly attire , new fashions , and superfluity of apparel ; and against '' striped and flowered stuffs in making or selling or wearing of them . ''

		They were to have no '' f oulds in their coats , or any other unnecessary fashions or cus - toms in their dresses . ''

		One of the North
Caro	PERSON	- lina Meetings , in
1752	DATE	, advised that Friends '' keep out of superfluity of meats and drinks and apparel , '' and that no Friend wear a wig without giving a reason for so doing , which shall be adjudged of by the meeting .

		Friends were not to run in and out during service , and young people were not suffered to sit too much in companies in the back part of the meeting - house without having some solid Friend or two to sit with them .

		Friends testified against ex - cess in smoking in
Virginia	LOCATION	as early as
1701	DATE	, and those who used tobacco in
North Carolina	LOCATION	were warned to use it with '' great moderation as a medicine , and not a delightsome companion . '' ''

		Vain and vicious proceedings , as frolicking , fiddling , and dancing , '' were testified against .

		Liquors were not used to excess , and at a later period Friends were forbidden to keep taverns and retail liquors .

		State distillers in
Virginia	LOCATION	were disowned .

		No public paupers were mem - bers of the Society , which took care of its own poor .

		Friends were not allowed to go to law with each other , but they might bring suit against a member who had been disowned .

		Friends were obliged to obey the rule , '' Swear not at all , '' even if it was necessary to disown the refractory member .

		They were known 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, everywhere by their habits of industry and thrift , their friendship for the Indian and the negro , their devotion to the cause of education , and their general benevolence .

		As a religious body they deserve especial commendation for their recognition of the rights of woman , and her practical equality with man ; and we are surprised that Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	, in the course of his many tributes to Friends , has failed to empha - size this fact .

		From the beginning they put in practice what so many have preached in later times .

		The sincerity and zeal of Friends made them efficient missionaries .

		They were among the earliest settlers of the South , and the self - denying labors of their travelling ministers as related in the volume are most praiseworthy .

		They had to journey hundreds of miles through the wilderness in order to reach such little set - tlements of Friends as had been formed , and were exposed to savages and wild beasts , and often obliged to sleep without shelter .

		We have not space to follow Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	in his account of the decline of
Southern Quaker	ORGANIZATION	- ism , which began with the present century .

		It has disappeared entirely from
South Carolina	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	, is weak in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and has also disappeared in parts of
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		There are two principal causes for this disappearance of Quakerism in the South , namely , the growth and increasing domination of slavery in that section , which became more and more intoler - able to Friends , and the way of escape from these evils which the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	pro- vided .

		By that Ordinance the states of the great Northwest were forever free , and thither the Friends directed their way .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	specifies four principal lines of travel from the South to this new land of promise .

		He says : '' The first emigrants to the West went on horseback with pack horses .

		They followed the buffalo trails , for where a buffalo could go a horse could go .

		All the women and the boys above twelve carried guns , and sen - tries were stationed at certain points , but whether this was a custom of the Quakers or not we are not told .

		When two-horse wagons and two-wheeled carts came into use a little later it was necessary to double or treble the trains in crossing the mountains ; a man was put at each wheel to push ; there were from two to four be - hind for the same purpose , and two to chock .

		These vehicles were usually covered with muslin or linen .

		Some had no paint , but were pitched with tar instead , while the horses were hitched to them with husk collars and raw-hide traces .

		The movers took with them cook - ing utensils and provisions ; traveled in the day ; camped out at night , and went singly or in companies .

		The women rode in the wagons or on horse-back , and these companies were frequently followed at a short distance by run-away negroes , who took this opportunity to make their way to the land of freedom . ''

		This great exodus of Quakers was disastrous to the South but fortunate for the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ohio and
Indiana	LOCATION	chiefly profited by it .

		It is estimated that in
1850	DATE	a third of the people of
Indiana	LOCATION	were
North Carolinians	LOCATION	, or their chil - dren ; and the stronghold of Quakerism in the
United States	LOCATION	, which came principally from
North Carolina	LOCATION	, was the Whitewater settlement of Friends at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		These fugitives from slavery formed the best part of the population of
Indiana	LOCATION	; and , says Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	, '' Nothing can be more unjust than to speak of ' poor whites ' as a class without energy , character , or ambition .

		Such is not the case .

		They are men who have always had a fierce , even an unreasoning , love of liberty .

		They are the representatives of the men who stood behind the English barons at
Runnymede	ORGANIZATION	.

		They plucked victory from the French at
Crecy	LOCATION	,
Poictiers	ORGANIZATION	, and
Agincourt	LOCATION	.

		They are the men who braved the heat of the day in the Revolution .

		They furnished the bone and sinew of both armies in the American conflict .

		Their typical repre - sentatives are
Jackson	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		These were the men who left
Virginia	LOCATION	, the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, and
Georgia	LOCATION	by thousands , because there was no liberty with slavery .

		These are the men many Quakers , many not who contributed with their brain and their brawn to the making of the central West . ''


GEORGE W. JULIAN	PERSON	.

		`` THE RED PLANET MAKS . ''

		* Mr.
Percival Lowell	PERSON	's charming volume on Mars must rank among the most noteworthy contributions to recent scientific literature .

		Only rarely is a scientific and philosophical problem so ably presented , through the twofold force of remarkable literary skill and a clear grasp of the subject-matter .

		The theme itself is sufficiently unique to arrest the attention of layman and scientist alike , but in this very fact lies the great difficulty of avoiding the danger always incident upon an effort to make a sci - entific discussion intelligible to the layman without incurring the distrust of the technical student .

		But a calm and careful perusal of the book from cover to cover will leave the most critical man of science assured that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has not said '' There are men on Mars , '' but only that there is striking evidence on our brother planet of activity such as we never see even remotely duplicated here on earth by anything but man ; that on this other world there may exist beings having something ap - proaching what we call intelligence .

		In brief , * MAKS .

		By
Pereival Lowell	PERSON	, author of '' The Soul of the Far East , '' etc. .

		With Illustrations .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 the argument of the story amounts to simply this : There is no negative evidence that pre - cludes the possibility of the existence on Mars of beings somewhat human in character , and there is no present likelihood that we shall be able to see , unless perhaps in the far distant future , such possible beings ; but there are broad physical features in the planet 's surface whose origin it seems impossible to ascribe to other than intelligent agencies .

		That this latter critical point has a deep fascination for Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	becomes clear to us ; and perhaps here and there his enthusiasm , in consequence , gets a little the better of his conservatism .

		Yet it must be admitted that in pleading such a case some enthusiasm is justifiable ; and where prob - abilities may seem slightly over-stated , it be - comes the duty of the reader to make himself certain just how literal the author meant the force of his language to be .

		He neither wrote nor pretended to write a coldly and merely scientific treatise .

		Gleams of genial wit light up many of the pages ; and a large part of the whole is distinctly philosophical in tone , and ably philosophical .

		And where the author has given reins to his imagination , and pictured the suggestions that
spring	DATE	from some of the facts and probabilities , he has in no case failed to state what is merely speculation ; and such speculation as he offers is rational and legiti - mate , and , in fact , lends vitality to the discussion of a problem whose future solution depends as much upon bold originality of thought as upon mere persistent search for observational details .

		Clearness and simplicity of statement , and a definite focussing of each chapter of the discus - sion upon fundamental points , are notable fea - tures of the whole style of the volume .

		Keen - edged criticism of the extreme absurdities of speculation , such as many Martian euthusiasts have indulged in , is the spice of the book 's argument .

		Altogether , it is evident that the pages are the work of one who is a man of let - ters as well as of science ; but their readable character does not render them unscientific .

		An hypothesis so cleverly presented is certain to be strongly suggestive to the most conservative scientific thinkers , even though it may fail in its minor details .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has incorporated in his book only the general results of his work at
Flagstaff	LOCATION	,
Arizona	LOCATION	, during the planet 's recent opposition .

		The more detailed and exactly technical ac - count of his work will be published as volumes of the '' Annals of
Lowell Observatory	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The whole plan of organization of his attack upon the astronomical problem that interests him has in it promise of success .

		A movable ob - servatory , equipped with an exceptionally fine telescope , to travel from point to point on the earth at successive oppositions of Mars , so as always to secure the best possible locality and atmospheric conditions for observations ; and persistent devotion of the observatory to a defi - nite limited line of work , these provisions together make possible a study that may be remarkably thorough and accurate .

		As to the discussion of the various features of planetary detail upon Mars , we may make the following general comment : The two chap - ters upon '' Atmosphere '' and '' Clouds and Water on Mars '' state their argument in a form that carries conviction with it .

		Granting a bare possibility that there may be some vital error in the conclusions , we nevertheless feel that rational probability stands wholly on the side of the general suggestions that are made .

		The two succeeding chapters , upon the canals and oases , make an interpretation of certain strange and undeniable markings upon the planet that at least demands more respectful attention than any interpretation that has ever been made before .

		No fair-minded scientist can read these two chapters without feeling that even if it is difficult to affirm positively their complete probability , it is at least impossible to take any more negative stand toward them than a suspension of judgment , with the balance of interest in their favor .

		The concluding chapter is the philosophical leaven of the whole book , and we finish its last paragraphs with an impres - sion fixed upon us that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has spoken a word that may well give pause to those of us who are too prone to be over-orthodox in our scientific faiths .


T. J. J. SEE	PERSON	.

		THE
June	DATE	number of '' The School Review '' is devoted for the most part to reports of the work thus far done by the
Committee of the National Educational Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion appointed to investigate the subject of college en - trance requirements .

		The tabular presentation of facts , which fills many pages of the magazine , is of the great - est value , and enables us for the first time to see just what the problem is that confronts the advocates of a system approaching uniformity .

		The question is as com - plicated as that of Christian unity , and it will not be easy to bring order out of such chaos .

		The work thus far done by the
^ Committee	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , only prelimin - ary ; and the comment now published by
Chairman Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	and others does not pretend to be more than tentative .

		We may add that this number of the '' Review '' is about double the usual size , although the price -LRB-
20 cents	MONEY	-RRB- is unchanged .

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Cultivated readers of sound tastes A pieaiant book and sympa thies will find their liter - of hterary essays .

		J \ .

		, ary predilections pleasantly echoed and warmly supported in Mr.
E. Beresford Chan	PERSON	- cellor 's scholarly sheaf of essays in criticism , enti - tled `` Literary Types '' -LRB-
Macmillau	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The papers deal respectively with De Quincey ,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	; and the author has chosen the collective title of '' Literary Types '' because each writer treated seems to him to develop a special phase in literary history .

		Landor , for instance , he terms '' Dramatist , '' not because he wrote one or two plays , but because the work he did was '' essentially dramatic in intention and execu - tion '' ; while the epithet of '' Man of Letters '' is assigned to De Quincey for the reason that no nar - rower term seems to adequately express his com - pass or versatility .

		The terms '' Essayist , '' ''
Phil	PERSON	- osopher , '' and '' Novelist '' are applied respectively to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	's rather arbitrary classifications are a matter of sec - ondary importance , not going at all to the essential merits and interest of his work ; but they seem to us in one or two cases at least open to cavil .

		Car - lyle , for instance , in so far as he was a satirist and preacher , may perhaps be loosely termed a philoso - pher ; but certainly few writers were less genuinely philosophical in temper and method .

		Mentally com - paring the most philosophical of his books with the work of such men as
Locke	LOCATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Kant	PERSON	, or
Stuart Mill	PERSON	, one perceives at once the generic dif - ference .

		It is certainly no disparagement of Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	to say that his real gift and function in lit - erature were primarily dramatic and pictorial .

		This fact is eminently apparent in his historical writing .

		It is for the pictures of men and events , the '' stereo - scopic clearness '' -LRB- to use
Emerson	PERSON	's well-chosen ex - pression -RRB- with which he evokes the historic drama , and makes it pass before us with almost sensuous vividness on the printed page , that we read his su - perb '' French Revolution , '' and turn again and again , with reawakening zest , even to the intermin - able ''
Frederick	PERSON	. ''

		An artist by temperament and purpose ,
Carlyle	PERSON	did mainly artist 's work some of it scarcely surpassed in its way , not a little of it dis - figured by the mannerisms which , hardly apparent in his early work , intruded more and more into his style after the publication of ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	. ''

		What reader of the '' French Revolution '' has not resented with growing impatience the parrot-like iteration of such epithets as the distressing '' sea - green Incorruptible '' ?

		A French critic , by no means unfriendly to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, observes : '' Unluckily , it is the nature of mannerism to fix and stereotype itself more and more , and it is not too mjich to say that
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's diction ended by becoming gibberish . ''

		The same writer says elsewhere , with equal candor : ''
Carlyle	PERSON	, who has been put forward as a sage , is the very reverse of one . ''

		Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	's essays are extremely pleasant reading , and redolent through - out of authors '' old-fashioned but choicely good , '' whom the world nowadays chatters about a good deal more than it reads .

		in a `` Puppet a considerable admiration Booth '' with for Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	, because he Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	.

		ig a i ways rea -LRB- jy to f ollow the lead of his highest interests .

		He tries his hand in differ - ent directions , wishing to give adequate expression to his mood and temper , and thus happily avoid - ing the offer of machine-made goods .

		He did a good thing in '' The
Chevalier	PERSON	of
Pensieri Vani	PERSON	, '' and might easily have continued to put a saleable line of goods on the market , to the great satisfac - tion of the consumer .

		But he happened to become interested in another kind of work , and so wrote '' The Cliff-Dwellers . ''

		Now he tries something else , always seeking to express himself as an artist , and shunning a weak strain after novelty as well as a commercial production of a marketable article .

		Whatever credit , then , attaches to sincere experi - ment -LRB- and with a man of ability , that is something worth considering -RRB- belongs to Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's new book , `` The Puppet Booth '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		With all the respect , however , due to Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's ability and sincerity , we do not think he has scored a com - plete success .

		The form which he handles is a very difficult one : it is so very easily misunderstood by the average reader , and so very easily misused even by a writer above the average .

		Its true opportun - ities are not readily perceived by the general pub - lic ; but the opportunities it gives for poor work , especially flamboyancy and euphuism , are tempta - tions even to strong men .

		So , along with things which really make their mark , we have things which are much weaker .

		The mixture is unfortunate ; people do not exactly know what to think of such things .

		Those who admire '' The Cure of Souls '' will not see that '' The Light that Always Is '' is any better , and those who like '' The Story Spinner '' may not see why '' The Love of Love '' is not so good .

		Even when one manages to avoid failure , there is great danger of half-successes like '' The Ship Comes In '' and '' The Stranger . ''

		Something , however , can assuredly be done ; and in what range , two such things as '' Northern Lights '' and `` After - glow , '' along with the two other successful pieces , make very manifest .

		We do not suppose that Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	will continue to exploit this vein , now that he has tried his hand and freed his mind ; but even as it is , he has written one or two things not un - worthy to be thought of with '' The Seven
Prin	PERSON	- cesses '' and '' A
Northern Night	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Some fifty years ago , it would not have been safe to write a book like Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , at least not with any expectation that people in general would know what it was about .

		But since that time , the Renaissance has been very much in fashion ; so that nowadays , The Spirit of
Tuscany	LOCATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 although the keen edge of interest has worn away , yet everybody feels very intimate with
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	and
Delia Robbia	PERSON	, while
Pisa	LOCATION	and
Siena	LOCATION	are like our own front yard .

		So everybody will have some - thing of an interest in Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's book .

		As to subject-matter -LRB- for nobody could guess it from the title -RRB- , it might be called criticism ; but it is criti - cism put into imaginative forms .

		Or it may be thought of as fiction ; but it is fiction based on the history of Italian art .

		Probably , however , neither fiction nor criticism was the author 's aim , so much as a reproduction of the spirit of Tuscan life , as absorbed by a traveller with a keen sense of the artistic .

		And so even the uninitiated reader , who glances at the book merely with the desire of a few new impressions , will find something interesting , just as in any clever book of travel ; for Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett is very successful in assimilating a variety of impressions and presenting them fused into one image or conception .

		But the reader who knows the Renaissance if only through
Browning	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, let alone
Burckhardt	PERSON	and
Symonds	PERSON	and more recondite authorities , the instructed reader will have not only such pleasure , but also the charm of comment and criticism on familiar things in imag - inative form .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has been compared with
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Vernon Lee	PERSON	.

		It would seem per - haps as though the idea of the '' Imaginary Por - traits '' lay at the bottom of some of the pieces of which the book is made up , as the idea of Landor 's '' Imaginary Conversations '' may have been at the bottom of others .

		But otherwise there is not much ground for comparison .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	was the student of art in its broad relation to life , and as such was profoundly interested in the Renaissance .

		Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett loves
Tuscany	LOCATION	, and therefore loves its art and its history .

		In so far as the two men deal with the same topic , we may compare them ; but we must remember the great difference of their aims .

		Some - what the same thing may be said of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	.


Vernon Lee	PERSON	was at first a historian and subsequently more of a moralist , although in both cases she dealt with the things of art .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, however , is presenting impressions .

		He does give us ideas on art , and sidelights , too , on matters of history and morals , if it come to that .

		But the main purpose of his book seems to be the embodiment of thoughts and ideas called up by the life , the art , the history of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	.

		And because his work is like that of the potter who gives living and beautiful forms to the plastic clay , he calls his book '' Earth - work out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		The English people to-day hardly seems as musical as it was three centuries ago ; there is abundant evidence that in the time of Elizabeth people of all ranks were not only appreciative of music , but , as a rule , familiar with its simpler technicalities and even skilful enough performers .

		Everyone knows the constant musical allusions in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and everyone will be interested in Dr.
E. W. Naylor	PERSON	's Music in Shakespeare . ''

		Shakespeare and Music '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is charmingly gotten up , uniform with the ''
Temple Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, '' and contains a mint of information .

		The immense medley of songs , dances , instruments , customs , technical terms , is here put into some sort of order and arrangement , so that he who reads may become familiar with an important element in the Elizabethan life which gives so much body to Shakespearian imagining .

		One point about the book is worth further mention .

		As Dr.
Naylor	PERSON	says , the student of the subject must consider two things : he must show how music is historically pre - sented in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, and also how it is emotion - ally presented .

		That is , we must first have accounts of lutes and viols , galliards and pavans , burdens and descants , catches and madrigals , and all the external circumstance of Elizabethan music .

		But then , under the second head , we must have any - thing which might show how Shakespeare or the Elizabethan age thought and felt of that one of the arts which is perhaps the most purely artistic of all .

		The student of
Browning	PERSON	, for instance , would have something to say here : curiously enough , the stu - dent of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	says in this regard absolutely nothing .

		Historically , this book is full to overflow - ing ; aesthetically , it is barren .

		Whether the lack be due to the author , or to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or to Shake - speare 's time , would be hard to say .

		We suspect the latter .

		It was not a self-conscious age ; it en - joyed itself , without much thought of how or why .

		In some ways
England	LOCATION	appreciates music more now than it did three hundred years ago .

		Mr.
Henry Clarke Warren	PERSON	, a gentle - man livin S in
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , has spent many years in making an extensive series of translations from the
Pali	ORGANIZATION	writings of Burmah and
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	.

		These writ - ings , he says , '' furnish the most authoritative ac - count of The Buddha and his Doctrine that we have , and it is therefore to be regretted that , inas - much as so little has been known in the Occident until recently of either
Pali	ORGANIZATION	or
Pali	ORGANIZATION	literature , the information of the public concerning Buddhism has been so largely drawn from books based on other , non-Pali , sources , on works written in the Singhalese , Chinese , and Thibetan languages , and in the Buddhist-Sanskrit of Nepaul . ''

		Of late years , however , a good many Pali manuscripts have been edited and printed , and it is upon these texts , to - gether with numerous manuscripts yet unedited , that Mr.
Warren	PERSON	has drawn in the preparation of the present work .

		The following passage from the translator 's preface is particularly interesting : '' After long bothering my head over
Sanskrit	LOCATION	, I found much more satisfaction when I took up the study of
Pali	ORGANIZATION	.

		For Sanskrit literature is a chaos \
Pali	ORGANIZATION	, a cosmos .

		In Sanskrit every fresh work or author seemed a new problem ; and as trustworthy Hindu chronology and recorded history are almost nil , and as there are many systems of philosophy , orthodox as well as unorthodox , the necessary data 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, for the solution of the problem were usually lack - ing . ''

		Mr.
Warren	PERSON	's work is published as a volume of the '' Harvard Oriental Series , '' under the gen - eral editorship of Professor
C. R. Lanman	PERSON	, and is a stout octavo of more than five hundred pages .

		Particularly noticeable is the fact that it is offered for sale at the extremely low price of one dollar and
twenty cents	MONEY	, and will be sent , postage paid , to any part of the
Universal Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	, upon receipt of an order for that amount .

		Evidently there is no money in this enterprise , for such a book could hardly be sold profitably for less than four or
five dollars	MONEY	.

		j g gj ven t o a study of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, by Mr.
R. Brimley Johnson	PERSON	, the editor of '' Essays and Poems of Leigh Hunt '' in the ''
Temple Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's account of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's life is perhaps the most sympathetic that has yet been written .

		This is shown in the treatment of such mooted matters as Hunt 's connection with
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the book he after - wards wrote on Lord
Byron	PERSON	and his contemporaries .

		It may even be thought that
Johnson	PERSON	becomes a trifle uncritical in the extremely lenient view he takes of this unflattering book on Lord
Byron	PERSON	, when he says that had Hunt '' written with less resent - ment , the book would have lost its vivacity , and there is no reason to regret any part of the affair but the heated and persistent abuse with which one of the most tolerant and humane of men has been loaded on account of it . ''

		The author is , at the least , decidedly generous to Hunt in this statement .

		Usu - ally , however , his judgments are fair and just , and sometimes even felicitous .

		He gives a neat sum - mary of Hunt 's merits and demerits in his state - ment -LRB- probably suggested by Hunt 's self-criticism in '' The Tatler '' -RRB- that '' he was poet , critic , essay - ist , and politician sentimentalized . ''

Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , has al - ready reached a second edition .

		The author has twice visited our shores once in
1865	DATE	, and again in
1895	DATE	; and he is thus enabled to draw some in - teresting comparisons .

		Dr. Lutaud is in the main a friendly , almost a flattering , observer ; and the American reader whose national pride is satisfied by enthusiastic testimony to the rapidity and vastness of our material development will find in his pages abundant matter of gratification .

		Dr. Lutaud visited some of our leading cities ,
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia ,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, etc. , find - ing in each much to praise , something to be amazed at , and more to be amused at .

		Chicago he finds -LRB- and who will gainsay him ? -RRB- ''

		une des choses les plus sur - prenantes , parmi les nombreuses choses surprenantes que pre ` sentent les Etats-Unis a TEurope e * bahie . ''

		Naturally , a special chapter is devoted to '' Les Stock - Yards '' ; and here the Doctor re-tells with gusto the swift and tragic '' Histoire d'un cochon ame ` ri - cain . '' ''

		Une seconde , '' he concludes enthusiastic - ally , '' suffit pour tuer 1 ` animal , et une minute suffit pour effectuer sa transformation ; n'est - ce pas mer - veilleux ! ''

		The
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- hopelessly outshone , it seems , by the marvels of '' Les Stock - Yards '' -RRB- gets three lines of passing notice .

		It is fair to say that the author emphatically repels the charge that
Chicago	LOCATION	is merely '' une ville d'affaires '' ; the reproach , he says , is quite undeserved , for he ` knows of '' no city which has made more sacrifices for its own adornment , for its charitable institutions , and for the advancement of knowledge . ''

		Other chapters treat of '' Les Religions '' the Shakers , the Mormons , the
Oneida Community	ORGANIZATION	, Society and Morals , etc. ; and the book closes with a brief ac - count of the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr. Lutaud 's recital is rapid , concise , and necessarily superficial ; and it should serve to help his countrymen to a glim - mering idea of the present outer aspects of the great republic which their forefathers generously helped to found .

		In preparing his volume entitled The Laureates The Laureateg of
England	LOCATION	'' of
England	LOCATION	.

		_ .

		- rrr -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Kenyon West	PERSON	has done a good piece of editorial and critical work .

		His plan comprises an introductory essay , brief sketches -LRB- about four pages each -RRB- of the fourteen Laureates -LRB-
Jonson	PERSON	,
Davenant	PERSON	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Shadwell	LOCATION	,
Tate	LOCATION	,
Rowe	PERSON	,
Eusden	LOCATION	,
Gibber	PERSON	,
Whitehead	LOCATION	,
Warton	PERSON	,
Pye	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	-RRB- , and selections from the work of each .

		Although the personal notices are about equal in length , and are very brief , the selections are meagre or copious in accordance with the importance of their writers ; thus
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	get , roughly speak - ing , half the volume to themselves .

		Mr.
West	PERSON	rightly urges that
Jonson	PERSON	was the first real Laureate , and that
Chaucer	PERSON	,
Spenser	PERSON	, and
Drayton	PERSON	, often men - tioned as belonging in the list , really have no place in it .

		Mr.
West	PERSON	's estimates are carefully weighed , but we think he does
Dryden	PERSON	something less , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	something more , than justice .

		To say that the former '' produced no poem which was the outcome of an exalted mood '' is as far from the mark as it is to call
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' with the single exception of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the greatest poet of the mod - ern world . ''

		And an avowed Wordsworthian should not be guilty of the misquotation , '' Joy it was in that dawn to be alive , '' when the poet said ''
Bliss	PERSON	was it in that dawn to be alive . ''

		We note also that
Nahum Tate	PERSON	's hymn , '' As pants the hart for cooling 1 streams When heated in the chase , '' although correctly printed in the text , is misquoted elsewhere , with '' wearied '' in the place of '' heated . ''

		We are sorry , too , that Mr.
West	PERSON	uses the pedantic spelling ''
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	'' for a poet the English form of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 whose name has been irrevocably fixed by centuries of tradition .

		The illustrations which the publishers have supplied to the book are simply atrocious , and a serious disfigurement .

		As a manual of reference on the subject of the Laureates from
Shad	ORGANIZATION	well to
Pye	PERSON	, many of whom are ignored by the encyclopae - dias and by such collections as Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's '' En - glish Poets , '' the work has a permanent value .

		The American publishers of the TWO volumes of works of R tj er t
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	collected verse .

		i \ i i -LRB- ocribner -RRB- have done well to collect into a single volume all the scattered verse of that winsome genius .

		The contents of three collections '' A Child 's Garden of Verse , '' '' Underwoods , '' and '' Ballads '' are thus brought within a single set of covers , and the two-score posthumous poems first published in the '' Thistle '' edition are incor - porated with `` Underwoods , '' forming a third book of that section of the work .

		A volume of 367 pages results , with small but readable print , and a photo - gravure portrait of the author .

		The task that has thus been performed for
Stevenson	PERSON	by his publish - ers has been done by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	for him - self , and the resulting `` Collected Poems '' -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- includes the contents of no less than seven volumes , published at various intervals during the past fourteen years .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's work is always conscientious and refined , the graceful reflection of a highly-cultured intellect .

		It does not often reach the heights of song , but , on the other hand , it almost never sinks to the lowlands of the mediocre and the commonplace .

		It is , and always will be , a pleasure to read such work as ''
Francis Drake	PERSON	, '' ''
Frangois Villon	PERSON	, '' and '' The Cup of Youth , '' with their touches of an almost Elizabethan inspiration .

		Mr.
Fayette S. Giles	PERSON	's book entitled More Utopian The Industr j al A /
The Bak Sociology	ORGANIZATION	.

		\ j - & laylor Company -RRB- is a discussion of certain proposed means of relieving and eliminat - ing poverty and crime .

		The author asserts it to be his purpose `` to seek for a just and pacific solution of social and economic questions which shall restore the rightful and necessary equilibrium between the physical sciences and social and economic conditions ; which shall confer upon the individual economic freedom and equality of opportunity ; which shall minimize poverty , want , and crime ; which shall make for morality , civilization , and happiness ; and which shall preserve the political and personal free - dom and equality which our representative institu - tions were intended to establish . ''

		The author considers some of the economic and sociological conditions necessary for the success of '' The Indus - trial
Army	ORGANIZATION	, '' through which , he thinks , '' an equita - ble form of annuity , or a cooperative savings fund , may be devised and maintained by feasible and just individual equivalents rendered , which shall guar - antee and furnish upon demand , to each member of society , reasonable material comforts during the term of his natural life . ''

		The writer is not enter - ing a new or unworked field , in the schemes with which he proposes to better the social conditions of mankind .

		The purpose of the book is worthy of all commendation .

		Its suggested remedies , how - ever , are entirely Utopian , and , like Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	's '' Looking Backward , '' are not likely to be seriously realized until the millennium is upon us .

		Although
Burns	PERSON	is one of the most Two books for the untra nslatable of poets , his continen -
Burns Centenary	PERSON	.

		* 11 tal admirers have not been deterred from the attempt to reproduce his songs in many languages .

		The recently - published work called ``
Robert Burns	PERSON	in Other Tongues '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , prepared by Mr.
William Jacks	PERSON	, offers evidence of as remarkable a tribute as has perhaps ever been paid to the genius of a poet .

		Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	has col - lected for us translations of
Burns	LOCATION	, by many hands , into no less than sixteen languages , including such tongues as the Czech , the Hungarian , the Gaelic , and the Latin , besides , of course , all of the more familiar literary languages .

		The Spanish , in fact , is about the only one that we miss .

		Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	supplies notes and editorial comments in abundance , and the book is adorned by numerous portraits of the translators represented .

		It is a curiously interesting publica - tion , and will be highly appreciated by readers of polyglot proclivities .

		While on the subject of
Burns	LOCATION	, mention may be made of the edition , '' revised and partially-re - written '' by Mr.
William Wallace	PERSON	, of Dr.
Chambers	PERSON	's '' Life and Works of
Robert Burns	PERSON	. ''

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of this edition , which will extend to four volumes , two being now at hand .

		The work is handsomely illustrated , and the price is moderate .

		A very readable and commendably A good Life of 8uccinct life o f Cyrus W > Field has
Cyrus W. Field	PERSON	.

		J been prepared by his daughter , Mrs.
Isabella Field Judson	PERSON	, partly from an autobiography begun by Mr.
Field	PERSON	himself towards the end of his life .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	's life-story is well worth reading , even considered apart from his share in the great enterprise with which his name is honorably asso - ciated ; and Mrs.
Judson	PERSON	tells it modestly and di - rectly .

		Four chapters are devoted to an account of Mr.
Field	PERSON	's childhood in
New England	LOCATION	, his early experiences as a mercantile clerk in
New York	LOCATION	, and his subsequent successful business career ; while the remainder of the volume is mainly confined to the story of the
Atlantic Cable	LOCATION	already told in some - what fuller detail by Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	.

		The book is neatly made and acceptably illustrated -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		E g
May	DATE	> 8 Guns and Cavalry '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- a satisfactory and authoritative treatise on the useful hybrid branch of the military service commonly known as the Horse Artillery .

		The au - thor , an officer in the
British Royal Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, is a lecturer at
Woolwich	ORGANIZATION	, and his book is a rsum6 of his lectures and articles of the last few years , writ - ten in a style nicely balanced between the technical 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and the popular .

		The story of cooperating cavalry and artillery is one studded with brilliant names , such as Murat and
Kellerman	PERSON	, the fleeting unex - pected chances offered by the circumstances under which cavalry and guns engage being the very ones in which the man of initiative , of dash , resolution , and expedient , may win his spurs .

		Major
May	DATE	's book is at once an interesting historical narrative and a lucid treatise .

		There are a number of illus - trations , largely portraits , together with plans of famous battles
Balaclava	ORGANIZATION	,
Albuera	LOCATION	,
Wagram	LOCATION	, etc. .

		`` Pusey , '' by the Rev.
J. O. Johnston	PERSON	; ``

Gardiner	PERSON	; ``
Raleigh	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Sir
Walter	PERSON	-RRB- , by Pro- fessor Laughtou and Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	; and ``
Charles Reade	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Charles Kent	PERSON	, are perhaps the most interesting of the longer articles in Volume XL VII .

		of the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now published .

		From Puckle to
Reidfurd	ORGANIZATION	is its scope , and it takes a thirty-page jump over the letter Q , the names of
Quarles	PERSON	and
Quillinan	PERSON	being about the only ones to arrest our attention .

		In ''
Maynard	PERSON	's English Classic Series '' we have a selection from Irving 's '' Tales of a Traveler , '' a selec - tion from
Prescott	PERSON	's '' Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' and an edi - tion of ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	, '' all anonymously edited , and therefore not to be commended .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have now added to their '' Classics for Children '' White 's '' Selborne , '' with an introduction by Professor
E. S. Morse	PERSON	; and a volume of selections from Long 's Epic - tetus , made by Mr.
Edward Giiin	PERSON	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	sends us Burke on '' Conciliation with the American Colonies '' and
Southey	PERSON	's '' Life of Nelson , '' both with no editorial name , although the notes and introduction indicate that somebody has edited them .

		Messrs.
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	are the American publish - ers of the new English edition of Mr.
Stanley Water	PERSON	- loo 's '' An Odd Situation . ''

		The introduction written for this work by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has already been quoted from in our columns .

		The book itself is a serio - comic presentation of the absurdity of protective tariffs between
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and ought to prove effective as a political tract , although it hardly offers the material for a work of fiction at least for more than a short story .

		There is little to say of Mr.
Hector C. Macpherson	PERSON	's book on ''
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- be - yond noting the fact that it inaugurates a `` Famous Scots '' series of volumes , that it is highly fitting thus to place
Carlyle	PERSON	at the forefront of the series , and that the author has done his work with sympathy and good judgment .

		The book comes endorsed by Professor
Masson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, and rather takes the part of Froude in the controversy aroused by the pub - lication of his notorious biography .

		In a volume entitled ''
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	'' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , Mr.
M. G. Dodge	PERSON	, librarian of
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	, has brought together the thirty-one prize orations de - livered at that college in competition for the Head - Prize .

		The literary value of the larger portion of these orations is unfortunately diminished by the prevailing note of exaggeration which has never ceased to charac - terize college oratory in
America	LOCATION	.

		The Sea Lions '' is now published by
Messrs. G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons in their '' Mohawk '' edition of

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons . ''

		The
Hare	PERSON	, '' by the Rev.
H. A. Macpherson	PERSON	and others , is the latest volume appearing in the '' Fur and Feathers '' series published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is said that 200,000 copies of a selection from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's poems , published by Mr.
Stead	PERSON	in his '' Penny Poets , '' have already been sold .

		It seems as if
Arnold	LOCATION	were at last having the '' turn '' that he predicted for himself as long ago as
1869	DATE	.

		Early in the field for practical educational work in the political campaign is President
Walker	PERSON	's ''
Interna	PERSON	- tional Bimetallism , '' just issued by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Also in this field will be a work on '' The
Mone	PERSON	- tary and Banking Problem , '' by Mr.
L. G. McPherson	PERSON	, to be issued at once by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		According to Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	, a remarkable illustrated Bible is soon to be published at
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, in Dutch , English , German , and French editions .

		There will be twenty-five parts , and an even hundred illustra - tions by such artists as Messrs.
Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Gerome	PERSON	,
Tadema	LOCATION	,
Israels	LOCATION	,
Sargent	LOCATION	, Constant ,
Munkaczy	LOCATION	, and
Crane	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Oswald Crawf	PERSON	urd has prepared a book of '' Lyr - ical Verse from
Elizabeth	LOCATION	to Victoria '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , thus adding one more to the many attempts to rival '' The
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is a good book , of course , but just how good must be determined by the number of readers who find their own judgment coinciding with Mr.
Crawfurd	PERSON	's in the matter of selec - tion .

		The following item from '' The Athenaeum '' delight - fully illustrates the hold that redtape still has upon English officialism : `` It appears that the costs incurred by the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, in obtaining the consent of
the Court of Chancery	ORGANIZATION	to change the title of the new
Ford	ORGANIZATION	chair of English history from professor ' to reader , ' amount altogether to no less than 323 , which it is proposed to defray out of the accumulated income of the fund . ''

		Book Sales of
1895	DATE	, '' published by Mr.
Henry Ste	PERSON	- vens , offers '' a record of the most important books sold at auction and the prices realized . ''

		It is compiled by Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	, who provides an interesting intro - duction , besides supplying notes and an index .

		The number of items catalogued is 5695 .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	ex - presses some interesting opinions on the subject of col - lectors ' '' crazes , '' telling us what sorts of his books are , in his judgment , likely to increase rather than to decline in value , and what are hardly destined for a more than temporary vogue . ''

		THE DIAL 49 their particular fields .

		It is to be regretted that they have made the fascinating beauty of their style subserv - ient to the spreading of many false and infidel theories . ''

		This gem of criticism comes from a book called '' Les - sons in Literature , '' published in
Chicago	LOCATION	by
Messrs. Ainsworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		No further comment seems to be needed , unless we mention the classification of
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, '' by birth a Scotchman , '' among American prose writers .

		The quickened demand for the works of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, consequent upon her death , will be happily met by the new and definitive edition of her complete writings , which her publishers ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have for some time had in preparation , to comprise sixteen volumes in their excellent '' Riverside '' editions of stand - ard authors .

		The first volume will have a biographical sketch , and all the volumes are to be thoroughly edited and furnished with notes when necessary .

		Each of the volumes will have a frontispiece and a vignette , includ - ing several portraits , views of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's homes , and other interesting designs .

		There is to be a limited large - paper edition , each set of which will contain Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's autograph written by her expressly for this purpose a few months ago .

		A reviewer in '' The Athenaeum '' has got hold of Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's ''
Tom Grogan	PERSON	, '' and vents his spleen upon it by means of such phrases as '' so dull a story , '' and '' such feeble trash , '' concluding as follows : '' The publication of such rubbish is deplorable , and it is thrice deplorable when it is stamped with the hall-mark of a good name .

		Again we wonder at the vanity and weak - ness of the mind that could write down such trash , and the vacuity that could be amused by it , and the blind - ness that could give a book so worthless to a world in which there is a plethora of good books . ''

		Well , well !

		this must be one of the reviewers who classed '' The Red Badge of Courage '' among the greatest novels ever written in
America	LOCATION	or anywhere else .

		The death of Mrs.
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, on the first of this month , at the advanced age of eighty-five , strikes from the list of living American writers the oldest of its names , and ends the career of a woman of remark - able force and ability .

		The world-wide popularity of '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' her best-known work , makes it impossible for any history of American literature to ignore the woman who wrote it , although criticism can - not give it a high rank considered as literature .

		A book does not always need to have literary excellence to ac - complish a noble purpose , and the triumph of this par - ticular book was so great that its shortcomings , judged by purely literary standards , are of slight account in the total reckoning .

		The book did more than all the arguments of the political thinker to awaken the moral revolt that eventually overthrew slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	, and therein lies the ample justification of its existence .

		There was a closer approach to art in Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's delineations of
New England	LOCATION	life , for she knew this subject at first-hand ; but they added little to the great fame that she had won by her part in the aboli - tionist propaganda .

		That fame was hardly dimmed by her exploitation of the scandal which sought to blacken the reputation of a great English poet , although partici - pation in so wanton and unwarranted an attack would have consigned almost anyone else to oblivion , and dis - credited almost any other achievement than that of writ - ing Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		The list of her books is a long one , but few of them have any vitality , or are likely to find many readers in the twentieth century .

Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	for the past twelvemonth , availing ourselves for this purpose of the special reports contributed by writers from the several countries concerned to the '' Athena3um '' of
July 4	DATE	.

		The service ren - dered to students of literature by this annual feature of our English contemporary is of the highest value , and we are glad to acknowledge our great indebtedness for the material pre - sented .

		As heretofore , we shall first discuss the literatures of
France	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	; leaving the countries of

		A lively pro- test is entered against the excessive attention now given to this epoch . ''

		Intensely interest - ing as that period of history is , the mere fact of their being concerned with it is not enough 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, by itself to entitle reminiscences and notes to the honours of publication . ''

		Our own times are not , however , neglected , as a number of works witness , the most important of them being Benedetti 's '' Etudes Diplomatiques . ''

Kenan	PERSON	's correspondence is , of course , one of the major events of the year .

		Coming at last to the subject of fic - tion , we find this somewhat discouraging intro - ductory paragraph : `` The output of fiction is as considerable as ever ; judging from the booksellers ' lists , at least two or three novels must be published per diem .

		A large proportion of these evidently find their use almost immediately as grocers ' wrapping papers ; but a still larger number find readers .

		The public of to-day nourishes itself with novels as well as bread . ''

		M. Zola 's ``
Rome	LOCATION	'' heads the list , and
M. Rei	PERSON	- nach 's criticism is so just that we must quote the whole of it : `` Six weeks ' acquaintance with modern
Rome	LOCATION	was enough for him to make a complete study of that com - plex entity .

		The book combines the pith of all
Bae	ORGANIZATION	- deker 's remarks upon the objects of interest in the
Eternal City	LOCATION	with the marrow of the whole history of
Rome	LOCATION	, from
Romulus	PERSON	and Remus to Humbert and
Leo XIII.	PERSON	, and a digest of all the ecclesiastical controversies that have taken place from St.
Paul	PERSON	's day to that of the last Encyclical .

		All this is dull , heavy , superficial , and commonplace enough ; the plot itself is mediocre ; and yet , in spite of it , the whole work is powerful .

		M. Zola possesses the gift of laying hold of the reader with a hand or rather a paw of surprising strength ; he holds you in a grip which he never relaxes till the end is reached .

		Abuse him as you will , you can seldom reproach him with boring you . ''

		The remaining novels of the year are '' L'Idylle Tragique , '' by
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	; '' Aphrodite , '' by
M. Pierre Louys	PERSON	; '' Apres Fortune Faite , '' by
M. Cherbuliez	PERSON	; '' Dernier Refuge , '' by M. Rod ; `` L'Empreinte , '' by M. Estaunie ; `` L'Ef - fort , '' by
M. Margueritte	PERSON	; and ''
Les Kam	PERSON	- schatka , '' by
M. Leon Daudet	PERSON	. ''

		As for poetry , it is lying very fallow , '' is the concluding sen - tence of
M. Reinach	ORGANIZATION	's report .

		Studies in local history and topography fig - ure largely in the Belgian literary product , and have , of course , slight interest for readers out - side the
Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		M. Fredericq tells us that '' Les Jeunes Belgiques '' are at outs with one another .

		They '' have become split up into two or three little hostile camps that vilify and assail one another with much fervor .

		Their members have even gone so far as personal as - sault in the streets , rendering judicial inter - ference necessary . ''

		Two of them , MM .


C. Lemonnier	PERSON	and
G. Rodenbach	PERSON	, have even fled to
Paris	LOCATION	in disgust .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has con - tributed '' Le Tresor des Humbles , '' '' a work of pronounced mystical flavour , '' to the litera - ture of the year .

		Three works of literary his - tory are singled out for praise : M. Loise 's '' L'Histoire de la Poesie Italienne , ''
M. Gil	PERSON	- bert 's `` Le Roman en
France	LOCATION	pendant le XlXe .

		Siecle , '' and MM .

		Hecq and
Paris	LOCATION	's `` La Poesie Francaise au Moyeu Age et a la Renaissance . ''

		M. Eekhoud has made a good translation of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	's '' Philaster . ''

		In the Flemish literature of
Belgium	LOCATION	, although '' no really remarkable work has appeared during the past twelve months either in the depart - ment of poetry or the drama , '' the prose writers have '' produced a crop that is not only prolific , but rich and valuable as well . ''

		The veteran
M. Sleeckx	PERSON	, seventy-eight years old , has pub - lished '' Vesalius in Spanje , '' a historical ro - mance of the sixteenth century .

		Mile .

		Vir - ginie Leveling and her nephew ,
M. Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	, '' still occupy the position of the two leading Flemish prose writers . ''

		The latter has published two new books , '' Wroeging '' and ''
Mea Culpa	LOCATION	'' ; the former has won the prize of five thousand francs , offered quinquennially

M. L. Simons	PERSON	has published a Flemish transla - tion of '' Beowulf . ''

		The last item in M. Fred - ericq 's report is the following : ''
M. Max Rooses	PERSON	, the well-known custodian of the Muse `` e
Plantin	PERSON	, has issued two volumes of art criticism under the title of
Oude en Nieuwe Kunst	ORGANIZATION	. '

		In these he deals with the principal masterpieces of seventeenth century Flemish and Dutch painting to be found in the
Louvre	LOCATION	and the
Antwerp	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	Galleries .

		He also includes excellent criticism of a number of Flemish painters of this century , such as
Leys	PERSON	, Lies , Verlat , bringing his survey up to the present day .

		Coming from the pen of one who is not only our leading literary and artistic critic , but also one of the most finished and charming of our prose writers , the book is as remarkable for its manner as for its matter . ''

		Signer
Alberto Manzi	PERSON	, writing of things Italian , begins with a tribute to the late Rug -
gero Bonghi	PERSON	, his predecessor as correspondent of '' The Athenaeum . ''

		His translation of Plato , his unfinished '' Storia di Roma , '' and his great work for public education , will long be remem - bered by a grateful country .

		Speaking of ed - ucation , we find the following deeply interest - ing statement : '' More enlightened ideas are everywhere coming to the front , and the revolution extends from the writers of children 's books to those who educate the youths un - dergoing a course of higher education .

		From
Carlo Lorenzini	PERSON	-LRB-
Collodi	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to
Giosufe Carducci	PERSON	a new , practical , and rational method has gained a hold in all ranks a method which no longer repels the young , but invites them to studies which , from being tedious , pedantic , and of doubtful utility , have become in the highest degree practical . ''

		Sig .


Carducci	PERSON	has published nothing during the year , but is engaged upon a poem to be called '' La
Battaglia	PERSON	di Legnano '' and an eagerly - awaited `` Storia del Risorgimento Italiano . ''

		He has also promised '' a work in several vol - umes dealing with the early Italian theatre . ''

		In fiction , '' the great event of the year is the new book by
Ada Negri	PERSON	, entitled ' Tempeste , ' '' a book which has , however , '' all the defects of ' Fatalita , ' which time and study should have eliminated .

		The lyre of
Ada Negri	ORGANIZATION	has but one string ; the greater part of her movements are well known , and the variations lack that spontaneity and ingenuous inspiration which contributed so greatly to the success of '
Fa	ORGANIZATION	- talita . '

		Though '
Tempeste	PERSON	' is not intrinsically inferior to the author 's preceding volume , it nevertheless furnishes us with fewer hopes con - cerning this elementary - school mistress of
Motta Visconti	PERSON	, singularly favored by fortune since her debut , and now to the surprise of her Socialist friends married to a wealthy manufacturer . ''

		Another leading event of the year in fiction is Sig .

		d'Annunzio 's '' Le Ver - gini delle Rocce , '' the first of a cycle to be called '' I
Romanzi del Giglio	PERSON	. '' ''

		The com - mercial success of the book has not proved its value , but simply testifies to the power of curi - osity .

		This publication of the ' Vergini delle Rocce ` has laid bare a series of plagiarisms com - mitted by
D'Annunzio	PERSON	, both in his verse and his prose , from French , Russian , and Italian au - thors , and these not amongst the least celebrated .

		The philosophical conception of his last novel is inspired by some ill-digested theories of Niet - zsche , while its general structure is borrowed from a French work .

		The third novel of import - ance is Sig .

		Fogazzaro 's '' Piccolo Mondo An - tico , '' which '' has rightly been extolled every - where as a masterpiece .

		The author carries us back to
1859	DATE	; here the hopes and the struggles , the greatness and the meanness , the minds and the hearts of a little world , are set forth with de - lightful fidelity , without any striving after ' ob - scure things , ' without any posing , and yet with a certain grandeur and goodness of spirit , the two characteristics of
Fogazzaro	ORGANIZATION	's whole work .

		He makes his '59 bear a strong resemblance to the present year of grace in all that has regard to the freshness of hope and the desire for a high standard of national morality . ''

		Other novels are
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rovetta 's '' II Tenente dei Lancieri '' and
Signora Serao	PERSON	's '' L'Indifferente . ''

		The twenty-fifth anniversary of the complete inte - gration of the Italian kingdom has naturally called forth many books of recent Italian his - tory , and the outburst of Napoleonic literature has been almost as great in
Italy	LOCATION	as in
France	LOCATION	.

		Sig .

		Tebaldo , in his '' Napoleone : una
Pagina Storico	PERSON	- Psicologica del Genio , '' argues that ''
Napoleon	PERSON	was not epileptic in the proper sig - nification of the word , although exhibiting sev - eral characteristics of epilepsy ; he was neu - rotic . ''

		A similar study of
Byron	LOCATION	, by Sig .

		Mingazzini , ''
Sullo Stato Mentale	PERSON	di Lord
Byron	PERSON	, '' argues '' that anyone who should at - tempt to reduce to a definite morbid type the psychopathic manifestations that occur in
Byron	LOCATION	's life would fail in the endeavour , '' but finds a lack of equilibrium , coupled with the special effects of alcoholism and opium-eating .

		Another great poet was undoubtedly epileptic , 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, according to Sig .

		Patrizi 's ''
Saggio Critico	PERSON	- Antropologico su G. Leopardi . ''

		These Italian disciples of Professor
Lombroso	PERSON	seem unwilling to allow that any man of great genius can be wholly sound mentally .

		A far more serious and well-balanced work is Sig .

		Morselli 's ''
L'Eredita Materiale	PERSON	,
Morale	ORGANIZATION	, e
Intellecttuale del XIX	ORGANIZATION	.

		Secolo , '' in which this distinguished scholar '' examines separately and impartially the phenomena of the struggle for existence , intensified and rendered almost ferocious by the increased means of resistance and combat .

		On the one hand , we see an increase in the number of lunatics and suicides ; on the other , morality is steadily emancipating itself from the theocracy , and sociology is preparing a better future for the disinherited . ''

		The study of sociology in
Italy	LOCATION	, as everywhere else , is as - suming large dimensions .

		Sig .

		de Amicis , it is said , has been converted to socialism .

		Among the books in this department are ''
Societa	ORGANIZATION	, Socialismo , e Anarchia , '' by Sig .

		Augias ; '' II Socialismo e la Scuola , '' by Sig .

		Pancera ; and ''
Socialismo Cattolico	PERSON	, '' by Sig .

		Soderini .


Spain	LOCATION	reports a long list of works historical or otherwise erudite in character , but hardly deserving of enumeration here .

		Senor Men - endez y Pelayo is carrying on his monumental edition of
Lope de Vega	PERSON	, his '' Antologia de
Poetas Hispano	PERSON	- Americanos , '' and his edition of Quevedo . ''

		Regarding poetry , fiction , and the drama , there is , unfortunately , little to be said .

		Poetry is in a languid state .

		A certain amount of verse on the old lines is produced ; but there is certainly nothing published that is in the least degree likely to astonish the reader , or indicates a new departure of any value , or is likely to add a new name to the well-known list . ''

		The only exception to this general state - ment is furnished by the sonnets and madri - gals of Senor
Rodriguez Marin	PERSON	, '' who imitates the models of our golden age to perfection . ''

		The theatre has witnessed new plays by
Senores Echegaray	PERSON	,
P. Galdos	PERSON	,
Dicenta	PERSON	, and
Feliu y Codina	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among novels , the '' Nazarin '' of
Senor Galdos	PERSON	stands first , followed by the ''
Juanita	PERSON	la Larga '' of Senor Valera , the ''
Los Magos	LOCATION	de
Cadiz	LOCATION	'' of
Senor P. Valdes	PERSON	, and
Senora Bazan	PERSON	's four-volume collection of short stories and miscellaneous sketches .

		From
Greece	LOCATION	we do not expect very much in the way of literature of general interest .

		The Olympic Games have naturally given rise to a number of books , the more important of which are enumerated by Mr.
Lambros	PERSON	. ''

		Of his - torical publications , by far the most important is the ` History of AH Pasha , ' by
Spyridon Aravantinos	PERSON	.

		... It comprises not only the life and deeds of the tyrant of
Epirus	LOCATION	, but also his surroundings and contemporary events as well ; and , besides , it depicts the manners and customs of the time . ''

		Professor
George Hatzi	PERSON	- dakis , of the
University of Athens	ORGANIZATION	, '' adduces in his treatise on * The Hellenism of the Ancient Macedonians ' indisputable proofs , historical and philological , of the identity of the country - men of
Philip	LOCATION	and
Alexander	PERSON	with the Greek nation . ''

		The best imaginative work of the year is the volume of '' Poems New and Old '' by Mr.
A. Provelengios	PERSON	. ''

		A native of the island of Siphnos , he is most at home on the sea .

		Pence that part of his poems of which the title is * Thalassa ' is the most beautiful .

		Yet there are many gems to be found in ' Au - tumn Harmonies , ' his ` German Reminiscences , ' his ' Sides of Life , '' his ' Funeral Flowers . '

		Whether he sings of love , or bewails the death of his young wife , or admires antiquity or a little deserted church covered with ivy , he always soothes his readers by his sound poetical feeling and his lovely descriptions .

		But when he repeats a sailor 's song or describes the even - ing light and the setting of the sun at sea , when he brings softly before his readers the legions of mariners and their heart struggles , he charms us irresistibly . ''

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THEORY VERSUS PRACTICE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The construction of a certain class of verbs in the passive voice , with an object , is inevitable , as its very opponents testify by usage when off their guard .

		The ''
New York	LOCATION	Sun '' was recently caught in its own trap ; and now comes another .

		The
American Book Company	ORGANIZATION	has just issued a new '' Practical Rhetoric '' by Profes - sor Quackenbos .

		On page 242 is the strong statement that '' passive verbs can not properly govern the object - ive case ... The construction has been tolerated as convenient , but is protested against by all who respect pure English . ''

		On page 10 , however , we have the state - ment that `` the writer is shown how to express his thoughts , '' etc. , in which the words '' how to express his thoughts '' are of course the object of '' is shown . ''

		It is time that critics , and especially editors who adopt for their motto the words of
Lowell	LOCATION	, '' I am a bookman , '' thus laying claim to a wide knowledge of literature , should throw aside a rule whose formulation is due to faulty logic and narrow induction , and enjoy a privilege which is theirs by the genius of Indo-European speech , the laws of thought , and the usage of good writers and speakers of the English tongue .

		TRAVELS BY LAND AND SEA .

		* `` The Great Rift Valley , '' a rather `` stout , handsomely-mounted volume of some four hun - dred pages , contains the story of a scientific and exploring expedition into
British East Africa	LOCATION	, told by a leading participant in the ven - ture , Mr.
J. W. Gregory	PERSON	of the Natural His - tory department of the British Museum .

		The Expedition was undertaken in
1892 3	DATE	, and Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	accompanied it as naturalist .

		The interest of the volume is scientific rather than literary ; for while the author presents many useful facts as to the flora and fauna , the geology and anthropology , of the regions vis - ited , his style is as matter-of-fact as his journey was comfortably devoid of the '' hair - breadth ` scapes '' and privations that usually fall to the lot of the African explorer .

		Since the discov - eries of
Burton	PERSON	and Speke and of
Livingstone	PERSON	verified the native reports of great inland seas toward the interior of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	, the investigation of the East African lake sys - tem has been the branch of exploration in which the widest general interest has been taken .

		Mr.
F. Galton	PERSON	pointed out , in
1884	DATE	, that the great depression in which lakes
Naivasha	LOCATION	and
Baringo	LOCATION	lie is really part of one '' which begins with the Dead Sea , extends down the Red Sea , and ends at
Lake Tanganyika	LOCATION	'' a view which has been often repeated , but has remained as a hazy speculation until Professor Suess of
Vienna	LOCATION	recently gave it scientific expression .

		Turning to a map of the East African lake sys - tem , we find that the lakes may be classed under two widely differing types , some rounded in shape , as the
Nyanza	LOCATION	; others long and nar - row , as
Tanganyika	LOCATION	and the
Nyassa	LOCATION	; while the description of explorers show us that the shores of the round ones are low and shelving , and * THB GREAT RIFT VALLEY : Being the Narrative of a Journey to

		that the long ones lie , like fiords , between high precipitous cliffs .

		The map shows , also , that these two types of lakes are ranged on a def - inite plan the long fiord-like ones occurring on two lines which pass one on either side of the
Nyanza	LOCATION	and meet at
Basso Narok	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Lake Rudolph -RRB- , the line running thence northward -LRB- as a strip of low land , dotted with lakes and old lake-basins -RRB- to the lower end of the
Red Sea	LOCATION	, which repeats on a larger scale the struc - ture of the fiord-like lakes .

		The
Gulf of Akaba	LOCATION	, at the northern end of the
Red Sea	LOCATION	, leads to a similar valley or strip of low land , and from this the Dead Sea and the
Jordan	PERSON	valley '' con - tinue the same type of geographical structure , till it ends on the plains of
Syria	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus , says Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	, from the Lebanons almost to the
Cape	LOCATION	there runs a valley , unique both on ac - count of the persistence with which it maintains its trough-like form , and also from the fact that scattered along its floor is a series of over thirty lakes , only one of which has an outlet to the sea .

		The question whether portions of this remarkable valley were formed independently and successively , or whether it was all formed at once and by the same process , must be finally answered by geology .

		History , however , gives some useful hints . ''

		Along the line the natives have traditions of great changes in the structure of the country .

		The Arabs tell us that the
Red Sea	LOCATION	is simply water that did not dry up after
Noah	PERSON	's deluge .

		The Somali say that when their ancestors crossed from
Arabia	LOCATION	to
Africa	LOCATION	there was a land connection between the two , across the straits of
Bab el Mandeb	ORGANIZATION	.

		The natives of
Ujiji	LOCATION	, at the southern end of the line , have a folklore that goes back to the time when
Lake Tanganyika	LOCATION	was formed by the flood - ing of a fertile plain , rich in cattle and plantations .

		And at the northern end of the valley we have the ac - counts of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah . ''

		The structure , therefore , of the
Rift Valley	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	conveniently terms it , has very va - ried interests geological and geographical , by reason of its connection with the history of the eastern basin of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	; and eth - nographical , on account of its explanation of some of the best-known stories in our folk-lore .

		The author suggests that the exploration of this region may possibly furnish some explan - atory hints as to certain features in the surface of the moon the long narrow clefts known as '' rills , '' for instance . ''

		If all the air and water were removed from the earth , then the
Rift Valley	ORGANIZATION	would present much the same aspect to an inhabitant of the moon that some of the larger of the lunar rills present to us . ''

		Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's matterful book is well provided with maps and illustrations .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, '' The Cruise of the ' Antarctic , ' '' by Mr.
H. J. Bull	PERSON	, tells the story of an expedition , pro- jected and conducted by Mr.
Bull	PERSON	, and organ - ized by the Norwegian whaling pioneer ,
Svend Foyn	PERSON	, to the
South Polar Regions	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its pri - mary object was to prove whether the right whale or the sperm whale could be successfully hunted off
South Victoria Land	LOCATION	; secondarily , or rather incidentally -LRB- for the expedition was essentially a private commercial venture -RRB- , it was proposed to learn more of the mysterious regions to the far south , and if possible to effect a landing on the
South Polar Continent	ORGANIZATION	itself which was accomplished , the author and his companions landing at
Cape Adare	LOCATION	, the east - ern extremity of the Continent , on
January 24 , 1894	DATE	.

		The '' Antarctic '' was a small sailing vessel , with auxiliary steam , of two hundred tons .

		This small craft had a voyage of four - teen thousand miles before her , before the real work of the expedition could fairly be said to be - gin .

		Sailing from
Norway	LOCATION	in
September , 1893	DATE	, the '' Antarctic '' touched at
Tristan D'Acunha	ORGANIZATION	on
November 24	DATE	, made the
Kerguelen	LOCATION	or Des - olation Islands -LRB- where six weeks were spent in sealing -RRB- on
December 19	DATE	, and reached
Mel	PERSON	- bourne at the end of
February , 1894	DATE	.

		After a thorough overhaul , the vessel started for the
Campbell Islands	ORGANIZATION	on a sealing trip , which proved a disastrous one , the '' Antarctic '' going aground in a gale and sustaining damage which necessitated a return to
Melbourne	LOCATION	for repairs .

		In
September	DATE	a start was made for
South Vic	LOCATION	- toria Land .

		The first iceberg -LRB- six hundred feet high and several miles in length -RRB- was sighted on
November 5	DATE	, but within forty-eight hours from this an accident to the propeller compelled an immediate retreat to
Dunedin	LOCATION	, seven hun - dred miles away .

		Thus nearly a month was lost before the ship again encountered the ice .

		How she eventually fought her way for five hun - dred miles through the '' pack '' ; how the lead - ers were disappointed in their hopes of finding right whales -LRB- reported half a century ago by Sir James Boss as abounding in these seas -RRB- ; how the battered little '' Antarctic '' returned at last to
Melbourne	LOCATION	, unprofitably `` clean , '' but with all the honors of her successful fight with the long dreaded South Polar ice-belt , all this , and much more , is graphically told by the author .

		Commercially , the expedition was a failure ; but it had the important nega - tive result -LRB- bought at a cost to Norwegians of 5000 -RRB- of showing that right whaling in Ant - arctic waters is not a paying venture .

		To har - monize this result with the reports of Sir
James Ross	PERSON	three suppositions are possible : -LRB- 1 -RRB- That Sir
James	PERSON	mistook the blue , or finned , whales for right whales ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the right whales have , since his voyage -LRB- 1840-41 -RRB- , changed their route of migration ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- that wholesale capture of right whales since
1840	DATE	has reduced their number to an insignificant quantity .

		The third supposition is accepted by the author as the most plausible one .

		The direct scientific results of the expedition were rather meagre as might have been expected , the voyage being primarily a whaling voyage , and there being no one of fair scientific attainments on the ves - sel .

		Fortunately , a lichen of some interest to botanists was found growing at
Cape Adare	LOCATION	. ''

		As it was previously held that no vegetation , even of the lowest order , was possible in the rigorous climate of
Antarctica	LOCATION	, this interesting lichen has created a great sensation . ''

		Sea - weed collected at
Cape Adare	LOCATION	was also carried to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It may be proved , Mr.
Bull	PERSON	thinks , that this sea-weed was actually growing when found ; so that '' the number of Antarctic bot - anic species will be doubled there will be two instead of one . ''

		As a tale of adventure the volume will be found very readable .

		There are a number of illustrations by Mr.
Burn Mur	PERSON	- doch after photographs taken by the author ; and Mr.
Wyllie	PERSON	, A.R.A. , supplies a clever front - ispiece .

		The recent political tragedy at the shrine of
Shah Abdul Azim	PERSON	, near
Tehran	LOCATION	, invests Gen - eral Sir
T. E. Gordon	PERSON	's
Persia	LOCATION	Revisited '' with a certain melancholy timeliness .

		The au - thor , who was for some years military attache to the British legation at
Tehran	LOCATION	, revisited
Persia	LOCATION
last autumn	DATE	; and the news of the assas - sination of the
Shah	ORGANIZATION	,
Nasr-ed-Din	ORGANIZATION	, was received by him while the present volume , which is mainly the outcome of the autumn journey , was preparing for publication . ''

		I little thought , '' says General
Gordon	PERSON	, '' when I had the honor of conversing with the
Shah	PERSON	in
October	DATE	last , that it was possible a king so admired and loved by his people , and then looking forward with pride and pleasure to the celebration of his approaching jubilee , should perish in their midst by the hand of an assassin within five days of the event . ''

		The
Shah	PERSON	's death created a somewhat critical situation in
Persia	LOCATION	, which the author discusses in two supplementary chap - ters that throw some timely light on Persian politics and dynastic questions .

		The bulk of the volume consists of a general survey of the
Persia	LOCATION	of to-day , duly enlivened with anecdotes and incidents of travel , which enables the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 reader to form a fair idea of the economic , industrial , and social status of the country , and of its prospects as a possible future participant in the onward march of progressive nations .

		It is wrong , the author thinks , to suppose that the Persians are dead to all desire for progress , or that their religion is an effective bar to such desire .

		The Moullas -LRB- priests -RRB- are naturally opposed to popular education , in which they plainly see the beginning of the end of their own undoing .

		As one of them frankly said , '' The people will read the Koran for them - selves , and what will be left for us to do ? ''

		But there has always been much liberty of speech and opinion in
Persia	LOCATION	.

		Six hundred years ago
Hafiz	PERSON	and
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	freely ex - pressed their contempt of the '' meddling
Moul	PERSON	- las '' ; while not very long ago , our author notes , the graceless donkey-boys of the great towns would vent their scorn and voice the popular feeling by shouting injuriously , '' Br-r-r-o ak - hound ! ''

		-LRB- Go on , priest ! -RRB-

		when they saw a spiritual father ambling along on his donkey .

		In fine ,
Persia	LOCATION	is advancing , slowly indeed , but not halting , still less sliding back , as some say .

		The late
Shah	PERSON	was a liberal man , and concilia - tory and just toward his Christian subjects .

		Christian missionaries are protected in their work that is , so long as they do not show what the Moullas might term a '' pernicious activity '' in proselytizing Mohammedans .

		The Amer - ican Presbyterian Mission is the only mission in
Tehran	LOCATION	; and , says the author , '' it carries on its work so smoothly and judiciously that the sensitive susceptibilities of the most fanat - ical Moullas are never roused nor ruffled .

		They have succeeded well by never attempting too much . ''

		This is true praise .

		General
Gordon	PERSON	's opinion of the present
Shah	PERSON	is a favorable one ; and there seems to be good reason to believe that under him the equable and fairly enlight - ened and progressive regime of his father will be continued .

		The author does not omit to tell us something of the nightingale the pet cage - bird of the Persians , the red rose 's Endymion , the bird sung by bards of Shiraz and of Dub - lin , for Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's bulbul -LRB- warbling by the Liffey -RRB- is no less tuneful than those that sang '' by the calm Bendemeer . ''

		The nightingale is the favorite singing-bird of the Persians , the young male birds being captured from the nests when fully fledged , brought up by hand , and then sold in the towns , where there is a brisk demand for them as General
Gordon	PERSON	learned from two small boys engaged in picking roses for the attar-essence manufacture near Yezd . ''

		The shopkeepers like to have their pet birds by them , and in the nesting season these may be heard all over the bazaars , singing sweetly and longingly for the partners they know of by instinct , but never meet . ''

		The cages are brightly decorated with bits of colored cloth and flowers in season : '' In
November	DATE	I saw quite a dozen cages thus bright - ened , each with its brisk-looking nightingale occupant , put out in the sunshine in the courtyard ; and on asking about such a collection of cages , was told rather shyly , as if fearing a smile at their sentimental ways , that there was an afternoon tea that day in the neighborhood , to which the nightingales and their owners were going . ''

		A tempting little book , whose fair exterior by no means belies its contents , is Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	's '' From
Cairo	LOCATION	to the Soudan Frontier . ''

		The text is reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' and it pretends , says the author , '' to no other character than that of a record of impressions derived from a couple of brief tours in
Egypt	LOCATION	during the winters of 1893-4 and 1895-6 . ''

		The sketches , if slight in fibre , are very agreeably written , and merit reprint - ing .

		Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's style savors of literature rather than journalism though , as a writer for the Conservative press , he finds it incum - bent on him to glance casually at past Liberal shortcomings in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and to '' prod '' Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	and '' Labby '' rather spitefully for their share therein .

		The sixteen chapters '' Life at Sea , '' '' The Streets of
Cairo	LOCATION	, '' ''
Tom	PERSON	- my 's Egyptian Christmas , '' '' A Theban Race Meeting , '' '' A Eaided Village , '' '' A
Khedi	PERSON	- vial Progress , '' etc. are studded with striking descriptive passages ; for example , the follow - ing picture of a dancing dervish at the
Mosque of Mohammed Ali	ORGANIZATION	in Old
Cairo	LOCATION	: '' Without any preparation he has stepped quietly into the ring , a thin anaemic youth of barely twenty , clad in the sort of long striped soutane which these mys - tics affect .

		Extending his arms at right angles to his body he begins to twirl , and for five and twenty mortal minutes , by the independent testimony of many watches , he continues t6 do so .

		Every now and then , at inter - vals of about ten minutes , the speed of his revolutions -LRB- say , one hundred and fifty times a minute -RRB- would slacken , like that of a spent humming-top , and you might have thought he was gradually coming to a halt from exhaustion .

		But no !

		At the moment the pace had slowed down almost to stopping point , it would rapidly quicken again to its former pitch ... This man has all the air of a genuine mystic .

		It is impossible to con - template the countenance of this twirling fanatic , and the contrast of its strange quietude with the ceaseless motion of his body , without being powerfully impressed by it .

		As the endless gyrations continue the position of the arms is repeatedly varied .

		Now both are ex - tended at full length ; now one is dropped at the side while the other remains stretched out ; now one , now both are bent till the tips of the fingers touch the shoul - ders .

		Are the heavens opening in beatific vision to that human teetotum ?

		After all , why not ? ''

		Why not , indeed ?

		May not the twirling der - vish 's mode of juggling sense and inducing an agreeable religious exaltation be as potent as another 's ?

		Have we of the West so far out - grown the saltatory or Corybantic stage of ritual as to warrant us in flouting the artless devotee who thinks to please his Maker by spinning before him like a teetotum ?

E. G. J. BAYARD TAYLOR	PERSON	AS A MAN OF BETTERS .

		* Mr.
Albert H. Smyth	PERSON	, in writing his '' Life of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	'' for the '' American Men of Letters '' series , seems to have adopted the sug - gestion made by
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, in his `` Life of Alexander , '' that it is not always in one 's most distinguished achievements that one 's vices or virtues are best discerned , but very often in the actions and sayings of one 's private life .

		Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	frankly admits that he has not at - tempted to give a detailed account of

		cause told by
Taylor	PERSON	himself in his justly fam - ous books of travel preferring rather to emphasize his literary history at home .

		For - tunately , however , in emphasizing the literary life of Taylor the author has avoided becoming at any time either prevailingly over-critical or prevailingly over-eulogistic .

		But if Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	has avoided the two great - est dangers that confronted him , he has in one instance at least seriously laid himself open to criticism .

		I refer to the introductory chapter on ''
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in Literature . ''

		The chap - ter was written , he says , because this is the first biography of a
Middle States	LOCATION	writer to appear in the '' Men of Letters '' series ; and possibly , too , although Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	does not say this , because it gave an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the fact that at one time
Philadel	PERSON	- phia , and not
Boston	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	, was com - monly called the
Athens	LOCATION	of
America	LOCATION	: a pres - tige which that city enjoyed until about
1820	DATE	, when , the author thinks , the centre of literary culture passed to
New York	LOCATION	.

		Now , undoubt - edly this is true ; but is it wise to devote even a very short chapter of a biography like this to the parcelling out of literary husks ?

		To anyone who looks closely at the literature pro- duced in
America	LOCATION	before
1820	DATE	, its real insig - nificance must be apparent .

		Franklin 's '' Au - tobiography '' and Irving 's '' Sketch Book '' are almost the only books written before this date that are now extensively read ; and I am not quite sure that either of these books will take a very high rank among the masterpieces of the world 's literatures .

		But since
Franklin	PERSON	was a native of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and Irving a native of
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	can only claim the honor that comes from the former 's later residence in that city .

		That '' the Sus - quehanna flows freely through European liter - ature , '' or that '' nearly every memorable name in our literature confesses some connection with the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	press , '' will hardly suffice to immortalize the literature of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, or to restore to that state its former literary pres - tige .

		It seems unwise , then , to centre the at - tention on the literature of any one colony or of any one state , when even at this date that of all
America	LOCATION	will hardly bear a critical inspec - tion .

		Finally , since all readers of biographies are impatient of introductions of every sort , one can not but wish that a carefully written paragraph had been substituted for the eleven pages of this introductory chapter , or that Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	had begun his book with the admirable chapter on
Taylor	PERSON	's '' Early Life . ''

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 Besides this observation , we can not make many adverse criticisms of this book .

		It is true that one occasionally comes across a clause or a sentence with which one is not quite satisfied .

		The taste , for example , of such expressions as these is questionable : '' Their sense of aifc was apoplexed . '' ''

		He ... found himself three thousand dollars to the good , '' etc. ; and of such a figure as this : '' In like manner
Bayard Tay	PERSON	- lor ... drove his ' new tandem ' prose by -LRB-
Jay	PERSON	and poetry by night smoothly and well , and with glad content . ''

		There are likewise two criticisms from which we should like to dif - fer .

		It is certainly too much to say that Tay - lor died '' with more unfulfilled renown and unaccomplished growth within him than any other man in American letters , '' although one accepts unqualifiedly the first part of Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	's statement , that `` the really great things of which he was capable were still before him when he died . ''

		Furthermore , it seems hardly sane to say of Taylor : '' It appears that other poets of
America	LOCATION	have surpassed him in parts , but that no one has equalled him in all . ''

		Putting aside faults like these , which are few and trifling when compared with the many and important merits of the book , Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	's '' Life of Taylor '' must take a very high place in this truly admirable series .

		It is a lucid and vivid record , told for the most part in the author 's own language , which not only shows
Taylor	PERSON	's connection with the environing life that did so much to mould his character , and which was in turn , and to no small degree , influenced by his healthful and vigorous career , but also reveals in a remarkable way those '' inward springs and relations of his character '' with which
Carlyle	PERSON	said every biographer ought to acquaint the public .

		It gives much of the literary , and something even of the political , history of the period in which
Taylor	PERSON	lived .

		On finishing the book one has a distinct impres - sion that he has been in the presence of the very man of whom
Berthold Auerback	PERSON	said : '' He was born in the
New World	LOCATION	, but ripened in the Old . ''

		EXPLORATIONS AND PROBLEMS IN THE
GREENLAND	LOCATION	ICEFIELDS .

		* The literature on
Greenland	LOCATION	is gradually be - coming voluminous .

		Each of the many Arctic expeditions and explorers has made a report , and some of the Danish officials resident in
Greenland	LOCATION	have taken the pains to write up the land and its people .

		The work on '' Green - land
Icefields	LOCATION	, and Life in the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
G. Frederick Wright	PERSON	and War - ren Upham , so far as it pertains to
Greenland	LOCATION	, is to be looked on as a sort of summary of that which has heretofore appeared in English , with a few chapters based on the observations of the senior author , who , as a passenger on the ill - fated `` Miranda , '' in
1894	DATE	, spent about two weeks on the coast of
Greenland	LOCATION	, in the vicinity of Sukkertoppen .

		Professor
Wright	PERSON	's account of his experi - ence , and especially the account of his contact with the people , is racy , and gives many an interesting glimpse of life in
Danish Green	LOCATION	- land ; but when the author extends his remarks on the people to the inhabitants of the island in general , he falls into the errors of some of his predecessors on whom he was dependent for information .

		The volume conveys the im - pression that the inhabitants of
North Green	LOCATION	- land and
Danish Greenland	LOCATION	are pretty much the same , though the former are probably the only Eskimos of the island whose blood is un - mixed with that of Europeans .

		Not only this , but the conditions of life in
North Greenland	LOCATION	are so unlike those in that part of the country over which
Denmark	LOCATION	holds sway , that a hasty visit to the latter gives no accurate idea of the former .

		Some of the erroneous ideas which have here - tofore been current have been given , it is to be feared , a new lease of life by their republica - tion in this work .

		Thus , it is stated -LRB- p. 144 -RRB- that the houses of the
North Greenlanders	LOCATION	are built of snow , while as a matter of fact their
summer	DATE	dwellings -LRB- tupilcs -RRB- are skin tents , and their winter dwellings -LRB- igloos -RRB- are usually of stone .

		Lack of familiarity with the matters discussed is again made evident when Professor
Wright	PERSON	states -LRB- p. 153 -RRB- that guns are said to be of no avail in hunting the walrus .

		This reads strangely to one who within a few months has seen about forty of these animals killed with these weapons of '' no avail . ''

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, enough , does not appear on the cover of the volume , though nearly half of it , and much the weightier half , is from his pen has never been to
Greenland	LOCATION	.

		His contribution to the volume consists of a discussion of the flora -LRB- living and fossil -RRB- and fauna of
Greenland	LOCATION	, of a summary of the various explorations of the inland ice , and of a general discussion of the glacial period and of those things which , in his judgment , were connected with it .

		Mr.
Upham	PERSON	has rendered a service to the student of
Greenland	LOCATION	by presenting a readable digest of the reports which have been made from time to time by explorers of the inland ice .

		It is convenient , too , to have so readable a summary of previous publications on the plants and animals of the island , though some of the author 's speculations as to the meaning of the facts may not meet with the general ap - proval of biologists .

		Apart from the criticisms that may be made on the subject-matter presented by Mr.
Upham	PERSON	, two general criticisms apply to his part of the volume .

		In the first place , it is partisan ; and in the second , it is pervaded by a tone of final - ity which comports strangely with the unsettled condition of the problems discussed .

		A strik - ing instance of the latter point is the following : '' Near the end of the latest Tertiary period , or more probably well forward in the Quaternary era , almost to the epoch where the increasing uplift of the northern countries brought on the Ice Age , men , having been created through evolution from the anthropoid apes , spread outward from their native tropical portion of the old world , to all parts of the great land areas of that hemisphere and to
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- pp. 215-6 -RRB- .

		This , it will be seen on analysis , is a very meaty sentence .

		No less than four momentous ques - tions seem to be settled by it : -LRB- 1 -RRB- an impor - tant question in geological chronology ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the cause of the ice age ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the ancestry of man ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- the place of his origin .

		As a matter of fact , geologists have never agreed to a classification of time which allows the Quat - ernary era to be well advanced before the be - ginning of the ice age ; nor have they agreed that the elevation of northern lands was the cause of the glacial period , while some of those best qualified to judge of this hypothesis re - gard it as about the weakest of all the attempted explanations of the ice period .

		Evolutionists have long suspected that the ancestors of the human race had more resemblance to anthro - poid apes than to any other living animals , but the boldest of them would hardly have ventured so unqualified a statement ; while those who are fond of having things settled , with or without adequate basis , will read with pleasure that the scene of this transformation from anthropoid to man has been finally determined .

		So far as concerns the criticism of partisan - ship , it should be stated that Mr.
Upham	PERSON	holds views concerning the glacial period and its phenomena which seem very singular to those who hold different views .

		In the chapters be - fore us , he is plainly trying to make a case , though it is often clear that the effort is uncon - scious .

		In order to make his case , he does what partisans commonly do he sometimes ignores facts that do not serve his purpose , and espe - cially those that are incompatible with it ; he sometimes states them in such a way that they seem to lose their force ; and sometimes , appar - ently for the sake of making his point , he puts interpretations upon them which they will not bear .

		As an illustration of a forced interpreta - tion to fit an hypothesis , a single instance may be cited .

		Mr.
Upham	PERSON	has long held what many believe to be an exaggerated idea of the amount of debris carried by glacier ice up in its mass .

		Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	found the ends of certain
North Greenland	LOCATION	glaciers to be from a hundred to two hundred feet thick , and the lower third or half of the ice well charged with debris .

		From this Mr.
Upham	PERSON	infers -LRB- p. 308 -RRB- that the same ratio would hold in the great ice-cap , which might then be filled with debris from a thousand to two thousand feet above its base .

		Thus , from the facts given by
Chamberlin	PERSON	, Mr.
Upham	PERSON	finds confirmation of one of his pet doctrines .

		But the inference is unwarranted .

		Indeed , all the phenomena open to observation in
North Greenland	LOCATION	, and physical considerations as well , point to a different conclusion .

		The sides and ends of the
North Greenland	LOCATION	glaciers present vertical faces on a magnificent scale , and these vertical faces often affect the sides of the glaciers several miles above their ends , so that the full section of the ice may be seen , both at the end of a glacier , where the ice is relatively thin , and further up the valley , where it is rel - atively thick .

		Passing up the valleys , these lateral sections of the ice show that the debris - bearing stratum at the base of a glacier does not thicken at the same rate , or at anything like the same rate , that the ice does .

		Indeed , it frequently does not thicken at all with the increasing thickness of the ice , and in some cases is actually thickest at the extreme end of the glacier .

		Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	's facts do not support Mr.
Upham	PERSON	's hypothesis , and should not be forced into such uncongenial ser - Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	might have said , vice .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 with equal truth , that the ends of some of the
North Greenland	LOCATION	glaciers are from fifty to a hundred feet thick , and full of debris from bot - tom to top , and that their surfaces , at the ends , are sometimes well laden with debris besides .

		From this statement , by the same logic , Mr.
Upham	PERSON	might have inferred that the whole ice - sheet of
Greenland	LOCATION	, to its very top , is charged with debris , and that in addition its surface is covered with it .

		Thus he would have had confirmation of another of the doctrines he has persistently advocated for many years , namely , that the ice-sheets of the past carried a large amount of drift on their upper surfaces .

		Mr.
Upham	PERSON	is an advocate of the doctrine that the glacial period consisted of a single epoch , though he recognizes the fact that there were more or less considerable advances and recessions of the ice during this epoch .

		Others believe that these several advances , considered in connection with the inter-current recessions , were of such extent as to divide the glacial pe - riod into distinct epochs .

		Mr.
Upham	PERSON	has not concealed his desire to minimize the distinctions between the several stages which many others regard as separate epochs , and in this connec - tion we find an illustration of a statement of fact in such a way that it seems to have little significance .

		Thus he says -LRB- p. 354 -RRB- that be - tween the first two principal stages of the gla - cial period thus far recognized '' the maximum retreat '' of the ice was , in
New Jersey	LOCATION	, '' 25 miles or more '' ; all of which is true enough , but it is a good deal like saying that '' the max - imum age of the earth is a thousand years or more , '' when every geologist believes it to be many millions .

		This is not the place for a consideration of the technical objections to the hypotheses which Mr.
Upham	PERSON	advocates , or of the evidence on which they rest .

		He has given much attention to glacial geology , and his views are entitled to respect .

		But the reader of the volume should know that the views there set forth do not rep - resent the views of the majority of specialists in this field .

		One does not need to be a geol - ogist to see some of the difficulties and incon - sistencies in which Mr.
Upham	PERSON	involves him - self in his account of '' Pleistocene changes of level , '' in connection with his advocacy of the hypothesis of northerly elevation as the expla - nation of the glacial period ; for while he main - tains that it was the uplift of northerly lands that brought on the glacial period , he supposes these same lands to have been much higher at an earlier time , without inducing an age of ice .

		Indeed , this earlier and greater elevation , if we understand Mr.
Upham	PERSON	correctly , is sup - posed to have been at a time when the climate was notably mild !

		Without going into details , the reader is warned that the time-relations of the various uplifts and subsidences which have doubtless affected the North American continent in the past , to the glacial period , have not been made out with any considerable degree of certainty .

		This is a problem the solution of which belongs to the future .

		Mr.
Upham	PERSON	seems to us not to do justice to alternative hypotheses as to the cause of the glacial period , and he still clings to the idea that the great ice-sheet of the glacial period finally caused its own dissolution , by sinking the land beneath it ; although the apparently irrefragable argument against this doctrine has never been met .

		The chapter on the stages of the ice age can hardly hope to meet with favor among geolo - gists .

		Old terms e. < / .

		, Champlain are used in new ways , and in ways that are sure to lead to confusion .

		Classification is pushed to an extreme which existing knowledge hardly seems to warrant ; and while Mr.
Upham	PERSON	's ideas on this point are of interest to geologists , who will not misunderstand them , it seems unfortunate that they should have been put forward in a vol - ume not intended , as we infer , for specialists .

		In spite of all these criticisms , the book has merit , and will interest various classes of readers .

W. M. Ramsay	PERSON	, D.C.L. , LL.D .


New York	LOCATION	: G. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		68 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, these three functions are mutually involved ; but within recent years the especial emphasis has been laid upon the determination of the text , the integ - rity and the historical setting of the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment literature .

		There have been numberless works that have dealt specifically either with history or criticism , but few that have attempted from a dis - tinctly modern point of view the application of both to interpretation .

		If we except
Bishop Lightf	PERSON	oot , there is no man among English scholars who has done more for the constructive side of critical scholarship than Pro- fessor
Sanday	DATE	.

		His works upon patristic literature and upon inspiration have been universally recog - nized as of the utmost value .

		Of all men , he is the best fitted to prepare a commentary upon the Epis - tle to the Romans , the one work in the
New Tes	LOCATION	- tament demanding preeminently a judicial mind , critical insight , logical intuition , and an historical sense .

		It is therefore with peculiar satisfaction that we welcome , as the first instalment on the New Testament side of the '' International Critical Com - mentaries , '' the work by Professors
Sanday	PERSON	and
Headlam	ORGANIZATION	.

		For such a work , the preface is remark - ably modest : to judge from their own language , one would suppose the only excuse for the new vol - ume was the need of completing this series of com - mentaries .

		But the reader is inclined to be more appreciative .

		The merits of this work may be said to be , in addition to independent scholarship and encyclopaedic acquaintance with the literature , the recognition of the Jewish training of
Paul	PERSON	as a mod - ifying force in the formulation of his theology ; the attempt to interpret the Epistle from a standpoint , not of to-day 's theological questions , but from that of the theological conditions of the first century ; and , finally , the attempt to construct an exegetical background by the use of that mine of information , the Jewish Apocrypha .

		As far as exegetical processes are concerned , the work is of singular excellence .

		Not only does it have the orderly arrangement that pedagogical ex - perience enforced , but the perspective in the rela - tive importance of the questions discussed is well preserved by the mechanical make-up of the work .

		It is , of course , impossible to discuss all the exeget - ical positions taken by the authors , but attention should at least be called to the philological discus - sions of such terms as '' son of God , '' justification , law , and that crux of all interpreters ,
Romans 3:25	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is gratifying to find so distinct a recognition as that given in the note upon the Doctrine of Mys - tical Union with Christ -LRB- p. 162 -RRB- of that central teaching of
Paul	PERSON	which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and even such an anti-ecclesiastical writer as
Thomas Hild Green	PERSON	, have done so much to clarify and enforce ; the former in his '' St.
Paul	PERSON	and Protestantism , '' and the latter in the long sermon so well known at second hand to readers of ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	. ''

		But , after all , the significance of the book lies largely in its profoundly conservative temper and tendency .

		A commentary is not a treatise on systematic theol - ogy , but it is to-day far more symptomatic of the di - rection in which critical biblical thought is setting .

		It is , therefore , a phenomenon that can not fail to be noticed by one familiar with New Testament scholarship , that the evangelical tendency so strong in the work of a conservative and at times apolo - getic scholar like
Sanday	PERSON	, is also perceptible in con - temporary German thought , especially in such men as
Beyschlag	LOCATION	,
Wendt	PERSON	, and , in certain particulars ,
Loofs	LOCATION	.

		In matters not purely dogmatic there are also to be seen evidences of a conservative reaction in
Stilgenfeld	LOCATION	,
Harnack	LOCATION	,
Kriiger	PERSON	, and
Jiilicher	PERSON	.

		It is , indeed , not too much to say that , notwithstand - ing many unessentials are being rejected and many essentials are being redescribed , the centre of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity is being increasingly felt to be the work and character of its Founder .

		At any rate , it is cer - tainly true that the constructive purpose so domi - nant in this output of the critical theologian is in keeping with the new positive method that is now prevalent among New Testament scholars .

		A commentary on one of the Gospels , and espe - cially upon Mark , calls for special critical attain - ments .

		The time has long since passed in
Germany	LOCATION	when the commentator would think of neglecting the modern theories of the relations and origins of the synoptic accounts .

		And yet , until Professor
Gould	PERSON	's work on '' The Gospel According to St. Mark '' appeared , English and American scholars had been content with separate works upon the higher criticism of the gospels and with the type of commentary in vogue a couple of generations ago .

		It is true that the various English translations of German writers notably those of
Weiss	PERSON	and
Meyer	PERSON	partially atoned for the lack , but none the less the absence of such works was not creditable to our biblical scholarship .

		It is therefore with special interest that one examines the work of Professor
Gould	PERSON	.

		We are inclined to believe that as far as textual criticism and well-balanced exegesis is concerned this commentary will rank with the best of those of the moderate critical school .

		Professor
Gould	PERSON	has shown not only a painstaking scholarship , but also a gratifying readiness to restrict his opinions to his data .

		Accordingly , his exposition of the text is sin - gularly free from bias , and , in general , such as must commend itself to other students .

		We miss , indeed , the wealth of scholarship shown by Professor San - day , but the gospel does not so naturally suggest studies of special topics .

		And even if one is inclined at times to question certain points -LRB- as the transla - tion of the aorist 14:41 and the account of Judas 14:44 -RRB- , it can not be denied that in general the inter - pretation is admirably done .

		It is to be regretted that we can not express quite the same satisfaction with the higher criticism of the work , and especially with the author 's handling of the synoptic problem .

		Professor
Gould	PERSON	accepts naturally the two-source theory of the synoptics , but he is not especially concerned with the bearing of such a position upon the interpretation of the gos -

		THE DIAL 69 pel .

		In fact , although we hesitate to say it , not only is the critical introduction disappointing , but the author 's theory as to success seems superimposed upon an already prepared exegesis .

		This is by no means what we should expect in a critical commen - tary .

		Especially after the work of Wenut is it surprising to find so little appreciation of the possi - bility of a predominatingly topical and so unchro - nological order in Mark , and utter silence as to the theory of a double apocalypse in chapter 13 .

		Then , too , it certainly would be expected that there would have been more attention given to relations of the synoptic with the Johannian account of the
Passion Week	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is it altogether impossible that
Mark	PERSON	's ac - count of the events of that week is derived from an - other than the Petrine source ?

		And in other cases one can not but feel disappointed that Profes - sor
Gould	PERSON	should not have given to the higher crit - icism the same attention and independent judgment he has bestowed upon the text .

		An example of what he is capable of is to be seen in his discussion of the Appendix to the gospel .

		Yet taken altogether , although hardly to be classed with the works of Professors
Sanday	PERSON	and
Headlam	PERSON	, this volume is sure to be ranked as among the best commentaries upon the second gospel if indeed it be not counted the best commentary on Mark writ - ten in English .

		Closely in line with the spirit indicated in the work of Professors
Sanday	PERSON	and
Headlam	ORGANIZATION	is the little volume on '' The
Kecords	PERSON	and Letters of the Apos - tolic Age , '' by Professor
Burton	PERSON	, whose similar vol - ume , prepared in conjunction with Professor
Ste	PERSON	- vens of
Rochester	LOCATION	, on '' The Life of Christ , '' is well known .

		The purpose of the present work is to treat the Acts and the Epistles of the New Testament as so many historical documents which may be ar - ranged on a reasonable chronological basis , and so furnish data for the historical student .

		Passages dealing with the same historical circumstances are arranged in parallel columns , whether they come from the Acts or from some epistle ; while the dif - ferent epistles are introduced into the harmony thus formed at such points as correspond approxi - mately to the time in which they were written .

		In such an arrangement there must be , of course , cer - tain presuppositions in regard to the chronology of the apostolic age .

		Such points as require detailed mention are discussed in a series of admirable notes , introduced as an appendix to the volume .

		In these notes we have an impartial discussion of the various chronological arrangements advanced , with litera - ture and such conclusions as seem warranted by the evidence .

		Special students of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	will perhaps be interested in Professor
Burton	PERSON	's adoption of the South Galatian theory , and his as - signing the time of the composition of the Letter to the Galatians to the period which intervened during the time between
Paul	PERSON	's second and third mission - ary tours .

		Thanks to the discussion inaugurated by
Ramsay	PERSON	's `` Church in the Roman Empire , '' this position seems now fairly on its way to dis - place the view so long held by virtue of the argu - ments of
Lightfoot	PERSON	.

		On historical and geographical rather than purely literary grounds , this view -LRB- which by the way is by no means new -RRB- seems certainly the more tenable .

		In a work intended for popular use , it would not be perhaps altogether wise to introduce critical dis - cussion in regard to the composition of the book of Acts ; and yet we can not help wishing that the au - thor had seen best to add a note upon the various theories as to the sources of that work .

		Just at present , the Acts is especially under investigation ; and it is not altogether impossible that even the unprofessional biblical student would get new light from the presentation of possible sources of the work .

		For after all , the work of a New Testament book , like that of any historical work , rises and falls with the worth of the sources whence its author drew his information .

		But this , of course , is a mat - ter which by no means affects the value of the book for the work which it was intended to perform as a sort of harmony of the Acts and the Epistles .

		The criticism of Acts is just at present among the most vital matters in
New Testament	LOCATION	study .

		The older view which accepted it as of coordinate his - toricity with the
Pauline	PERSON	epistles has gradually lost its hold upon scholars , and the tendency has been to regard it with
Clemens	PERSON	as composed of various bits of information which have been grouped to - gether and subjected to various redactions , or , with
Spitta	PERSON	, to regard it as a combination of two main sources , one of which is soberly historical and the other is almost entirely legendary and untrust - worthy .

		And yet there is also a tendency on the part of certain scholars just at present to treat this remarkable book with somewhat greater respect .


Weizsacker	PERSON	, for instance , although often question - ing the book 's historical accuracy , and always ready to discover contradictions between it and the state - ments of
Paul	PERSON	, nevertheless discovers many elements which he regards as genuinely historical .

		But the protagonist of the defenders of the book 's histo - ricity is the indefatigable Professor of Humanity in
Aberdeen	LOCATION	.

		In a certain way , Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	, author of ''
St. Paul the Traveller	ORGANIZATION	and the Roman Citizen , '' is doing for Acts what Professor Sayce claims to be doing -LRB- one can hardly say more -RRB- for the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	.

		But because of his archaeological knowledge , he has not so far swung away from lit - erary criticism as not to be convinced of the exist - ence of sources older than the book itself , and of the existence of other elements in the book which are younger than a larger part of the book as it now stands .

		Thus , the succession of remarkable incidents allotted to
Paul	PERSON	's stay in
Ephesus	LOCATION	-LRB- Acts , 19:11 -20 -RRB- , the story of
Judas Iscariot	LOCATION	, the account of Annanias and
Saphira	ORGANIZATION	, the speaking with tongues , are regarded by Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	as popular stories which have somehow crept into an otherwise thor - oughly trustworthy historical work .

		Of the latter fact , Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	is beyond suspicion .

		It is , indeed , delightful to watch his de - 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, votion to the historical skill of
Luke	PERSON	, about whose authorship of the Acts he is equally without shadow of doubt .

		It may be that this devotion is the zeal of a new convert , for Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	declares that formerly he held to the views of the
Tubingen	LOCATION	school , from which his archaeological investigations turned him .

		But be that as it may , he finds in the Acts the characteristics which belong to the first grade of historical works , at the head of which stand the histories of Thucydides . ''

		Every minute fact stated in Acts has its own significance . ''

		There can be no possibility of contradiction between
Luke	PERSON	and the Epistles ; and , indeed , the ingenuity with which Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	overturns apparent difficulties , or makes them serve the purpose of harmonization , is truly marvellous .

		It is , of course , not altogether a novelty to identify
Paul	PERSON	's second visit to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, mentioned in the Epistle to the Galatians , with the second visit mentioned in Acts ; but everyone had supposed that the question had been finally settled by
Lightfoot	PERSON	in favor of the contrary view .

		But then , so too had everyone thought that the question as to the location of the Galatian churches had been answered by the same great authority .

		Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	, although admiring
Lightfoot	PERSON	, finds plenty of opportunities to differ with him , and does not hesitate to charge him , so far as this question is con - cerned , with having `` led English scholarship into a cul de sac '' -LRB- p. 6 -RRB- .

		Having with considerable suc - cess attacked the traditional theory as to
Galatia	LOCATION	, he now with equal enthusiasm establishes not only the possibility but the certainty of the identity of the second visit of the Galatians letter with the visit of
Paul and Barnabas	PERSON	to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	at the time of the famine .

		It must be confessed that his assurance is not altogether unjustified .

		In fact , the more one considers his position and works upon
Paul	PERSON	's own words in the Epistle to the Galatians , the more one is tempted to agree with it .

		It would be remarkable if for a second time an untheological scholar , as Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	claims to be , should thus again reverse a supposed unquestionable opinion .

		It is worth noticing that Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	, while holding to unity of authorship in the work , discov - ers within it traces of a variety of sources .

		Chief among these sources is the '' travel document '' which embraces practically the second half of Acts .

		This again is not altogether homogeneous , but embraces
Luke	PERSON	's diary , notes of conversations with
Paul	PERSON	, and possibly other matters .

		As to the first half of Acts , the author 's opinion is somewhat cloudy .

		He re - gards it as inferior , decidedly inferior , to the sec - ond half ; but although admitting the possibility of various legendary elements in it , nevertheless is inclined to regard it as essentially the work of the author of the '' travel document '' who here was forced to use sources of varying value .

		Here again Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	seems upon solid critical ground .

		Various questions , however , suggest themselves , less , it is true , in regard to the general positions of the book than in regard to certain incidental points .

		Especially do we hesitate to follow Profes - sor
Ramsay	PERSON	altogether in his use of the
Codex Bezae	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this work , as in his previous book upon the Church and the Empire , Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	USQS this codex constantly to establish or illustrate -LRB- mainly , it is true , correctly -RRB- the point of view of the second century , as contrasted with that of Acts .

		But sometimes the Acts seem to be given a too prominent position , and its text to be rather arbi - trarily regarded as superior to that of the three great
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		And then , too , one would like the au - thor 's authority for his characterization of the Jews at
Corinth	LOCATION	as a self-administering community -LRB- p. 259 -RRB- , and for his certainty that sacrifices before the gates at
Lystra	LOCATION	are improbable -LRB- p. 119 -RRB- .

		Further , the book as a literary product is very uneven .

		Some points are altogether omitted which we should ex - pect to be treated , while others are discussed most exhaustively .

		The author 's style is fortunately vivacious and reasonably clear , but one could wish that the work had been undertaken somewhat more systematically and somewhat less from the purely apologetic point of view .

		And yet as a whole this book bears out the prom - ise of '' The Church in the Roman Empire . ''

		What we now ask of Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	is , that instead of re-casting semi-popular lectures , he shall give us as technical and systematic a study of the apostolic age in the light of archaeology as is his '' Historical Geography of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor . ''

		It is high time for an English or American scholar to produce a work upon this key to the New Testament history , which shall rank with the volumes of Clemen and Spitta in critical acumen , and at the same time shall sur - pass them in historical learning .


SHAILER MATHEWS	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		It is now sixteen years since the ap - vemon Lee 's pe arance of Studies of the Eight - latest volume .

		i / - * T i i i eenth Century in
Italy	LOCATION	, a book which excited much interest and admiration in the English and Italian critical journals .

		In that time , the lady who writes under the name of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	has become a figure in the world of art and letters , as distinct , if not as widely known , as Mr.
Pater	PERSON	or Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	.

		Her work is mainly critical , and of high value .

		Although most familiar with painting and music , and almost always finding her subjects in Italian art , chiefly of the Renaissance , her inter - ests are by no means confined , but reach out into general aesthetic inquiry , and more widely into ques - tions on the conduct of life .

		In ''
Baldwin	PERSON	'' and ''
Althea	PERSON	, '' dealing with aspirations and duties , she seemed farthest from home ; in '' Belcaro '' and `` Juvenilia '' she is perhaps of most general inter - est. .

		Her latest volume , '' Renaissance Fancies and Studies '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , like `` Euphorion , '' is more es - pecially directed to something of a critical treatment of a definite artistic and historical period .

		Rarely , however , does
Vernon Lee	PERSON	discuss any work of art
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 or any artistic development for itself alone ; and in this book , although the separate subjects are not mere points of departure for more theoretic discus - sion , there is never lacking the breadth of view and the general bearing on men and things which makes the author something more than an art-critic .

		As a historian of art , as one who seeks to render the temper of the Italian Renaissance in a scientific reproduction ,
Vernon Lee	PERSON	may not be as successful as some other writers .

		But as a criticism of a most interesting part of human development , her work can not be neglected .

		She has been called a follower of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	or Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	; but although her interests have probably taken certain channels in result of those men 's writing , she is by no means a continuer of the work of either .


Vernon Lee	PERSON	is a clearly-cut and independent personality , and net - works are original contributions , to our thinking , on ` the subjects which she handles .

		Those who have followed her earlier work know with each new vol - ume what excellences they may expect and what drawbacks they must encounter .

		This present vol - ume is hardly one of her best ; there is a good deal of the quality which has made her later writing dif - ficult to enjoy .

		Still , '' The Valedictory '' and '' The Love of the Saints '' will be read with great interest by those who have followed her work so far ; and although the book as a whole will not be remem - bered like '' Euphorion , '' of which it is a sort of sequel , it is one which readers of art-criticism will desire to know and think over .

		Professor
William Knight	PERSON	is a faith - a ?

		f ul Wordsworthian , although not ex - actly a brilliant exponent of his fav - orite poet , and is probably the most competent man living to prepare a definitive edition of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	.

		The work is now well under way , and four volumes have already been received by us .

		They are volumes of the '' Eversley '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , so acceptable in every mechanical way , and already associated with so many of the greatest names in nineteenth century English literature .

		Professor Knight 's eleven-volume
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB- 1882-1889 -RRB- has here - tofore been the standard library edition of the poet , but the editor takes care to inform us that the pres - ent edition is by no means to be a mere reproduc - tion of the earlier one .

		We summarize his state - ment of the features to be embodied in the sixteen volumes to which the new work will extend .

		The arrangement of the poems is to be chronological in the order of composition , not of publication .

		Words - worth 's own changes of text , in successive editions , are given in foot-notes , as well as other changes sug - gested by the poet , but never put into print by him .

		The notes dictated by
Wordsworth	PERSON	to Miss
Isabella Fenwick	PERSON	are reprinted in full , and topographical notes are also supplied .

		Poems not published dur - ing
Wordsworth	PERSON	's life , a bibliography of works and editions , and a life of the poet , are supplied .

		Thus far , the new edition corresponds with the earlier eleven-volume work .

		The new features are sub - stantially as follows : The notes are better classified , and carefully distinguished as to authorship .

		All the prose works , as collected by Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	, are given , and will occupy two volumes , following the eight devoted to the poems .

		The greater part of
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	's journals will be printed , filling two volumes .

		The correspondence , in three volumes , will be arranged chronologically , and will include much new material .

		The bibliography will be greatly expanded .

		The life , owing to the elim - ination of the letters , will be confined to a single volume , the sixteenth and last of the edition .

		The illustrations are to be a portrait and a vignette for each volume .

		This brief description will indicate the thorough and painstaking character of the work with which the editor is now crowning his lifelong Wordsworthian labors , and will show to the student how indispensable the new edition must become to him , however well he be supplied with earlier ones .

		The leading French critics who con - tribute literar y causeries or f ** w * tons to the newspapers collect their matter into volumes about as fast as it accumulates , a fact which makes it possible for the student of contemporary criticism to stock his library more largely from French sources than from any other .

		Indeed , one would miss sadly the many volumes of this sort of work that bear the names of such men as
Gautier	PERSON	,
M. Francisque Sarcey	PERSON	,
M. Jules Le	PERSON	- mattre , and
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	.

		The practice of these men would be worth imitation in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	if a significant proviso we had a similar body of entertaining and well-equipped critical writers .

		Perhaps the only way to find out whether we have them is to try the experiment on a considerable scale .

		But we doubt if Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	was exactly the person to begin .

		His two volumes of `` Retrospective Reviews '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , taken from the English newspapers to which he has contributed current criticism for the past five years , cover the most important works in belles-lettres that have appeared during that period , but are not dis - tinguished for either profundity or scholarship .

		Mr.
Le Galliene	PERSON	is preeminently a phrase-maker , and is often deluded by the ring of the verbal counters that he has coined .

		He says a good many graceful things , and also not a few foolish and bumptious things .

		Altogether , his volumes hardly seem to have been worth making .

		Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's '' Adventures in Criticism '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which is also a collection of reprinted reviews , has decidedly more value than the work already discussed , although in the very first chapter we come upon the
Philis	LOCATION	- tine notion that Chaucer should be read with the pronunciation of the nineteenth century , and this pronouncement is not unmatched by others equally depressing scattered throughout the pages .

		But Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	is , after all , a highly interesting per - sonality , which can hardly be said of Mr.
Le Gal	PERSON	- lienne , and his criticism is touched here and there , as his fiction is , with something much like genius .

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, Of course , the criticism is of the subjective sort , but that is also true of the French criticism alluded to at the beginning of this notice .

		At any rate , it is literature , in its fashion , and needs no further excuse for being .

		The chief present interest in the re - The latest of eent e -LRB- j ition of The R f h Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	.

		f .

		Lock -LRB- imported by
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- lies presumably in the illustrations of
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	.

		Without some such help , it is to be feared that Pope 's famous poem would hardly come to much of a market nowadays .

		It is interesting to think what will be the case a hundred years from now .

		Will
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	continue to support Pope , or ?

		Still , Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's drawings are interesting ; these particular ones not less so because they are rather different from those that we have heretofore considered characteristic .

		Com - pare , if you will , the portrait of himself , of a year or so ago , with
Belinda	PERSON	reading the billet-doux in the present volume .

		Or , better , compare '' The Toilette of Salome '' with '' The Toilet '' of
Belinda	LOCATION	.

		In each case we have a woman , a maid , and a toilet-table .

		The composition is rather different , but the chief difference is in the manner .

		Instead of the broad indications , the striking combinations of black and white , the management of large masses , we have painstaking attempts at drawing , judicious use of contemporary local color , and careful efforts at the rendering of materials .

		Indeed , this last seems to be the chief effort .

		The rendering of lace and vel - vet , of woodwork and tapestry , these are the artis - tic triumphs .

		Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	calls his work em - broidery ; and so it is .

		There are , however , some things even above embroidery ; the glimpse of the garden from the windows of
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	, the bit of river bank on the Thames , these are rather more charming than anything else that we remem - ber of Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's .

		Least successful of all the pictures is '' The Cave of Spleen , '' where he seems to return to older ideas , without the older simplic - ity .

		Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's early work marked an epoch , or rather was an epoch an epoch which is now perhaps farther from us than the age of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		Wisely , then , does the artist disdain the artifices of ancient history , and proceeds with the times to develope as genius directs .

		The overwhelming difficulties in which Fran ce f ound herself after the catastrophe of
1870	DATE	, the three-fold necessity of reestablishing a permanent government out of warring parties and factions , of paying the enormous indemnity exacted by
Germany	LOCATION	with the design of crippling her exhausted rival , and of re - covering her position in European politics , are all clearly indicated in the recent work by the
Duke de Broglie	ORGANIZATION	, `` An Ambassador of the Vanquished '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While this is in form an account of the
Viscount de Gontaut-Biron	PERSON	's mission to
Berlin	LOCATION	, 1871-77 , it is in fact a discussion of the relations between
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	during that time .

		Like its companion volume recently reviewed in these columns , Count Benedetti 's '' Studies in Di - plomacy , '' it makes imperious Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	its central figure , and presents him as a malignant plot - ter against poor
France	LOCATION	, ready to see in every sign of returning strength , and in innocent measures of reconstruction , only a burning desire and purpose of revenge .

		It is hardly to be expected that a public man of the war and reconstruction period can judge
Bismarck	PERSON	justly ; and it can not be denied that there is too much of truth in some of the French charges against him .

		Though he is one of the greatest states - men of the century , if not the greatest , his career has showed too much of the bully and of the unscrupulous schemer to be wholly admired .

		The
Duke de Broglie	ORGANIZATION	writes with much more of calm self-possession than
Count Benedetti	LOCATION	, whose grievance and passion were too evident , and the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's work consequently makes a stronger impression than the Count 's hot invec - tive .

		The liberation of the territory from German troops , the fall of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	, the failure of the scheme to restore the Monarchy , the
Kulturkampf	LOCATION	, the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	, and the final establishment of the Republic , with the negotiations and crises that at - tended these developments , are the leading topics of the work .

		When
Minto	PERSON	's '' Manual of English .

		Prose '' was published , a great step was made in that rhetorical criticism of good authors which has of late had a consider - able place in the English work of our American col - leges .

		That book supplied a definite method based upon a very generally accepted rhetorical analysis , and thereby rendered far more common the useful inter-play of rhetorical teaching and criticism of literature .

		The idea was emphasized that one can - not learn to write by writing only , but that one must read carefully as well .

		In the
last decade	DATE	much work of this kind has been done , but usually by individual teachers , or else in one or another of the many editions of particular texts recently published .

		We have now , in '' Studies in Structure and Style , '' by Mr.
W. T. Brewster	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book which , although it has not the scope of Mr.
Minto	PERSON	's , either in subject-matter or in method , has , in its more limited sphere , great excellence .

		It offers seven essays by recent masters of English prose , and a criticism upon each , both as to structure and as to style ; and thus it shows the way in which such work is done , and how it may be done with other authors .

		Its method lacks something in system , but gains as much in its particular applications .

		The study of structure is rather better than that of style ; the subject is more easily handled .

		But both parts are the result of sound and careful study , and will give the teacher many ideas and the student new insight into the possibilities of prose .

		The book not only shows what good work in English has been done so far in our colleges , but renders possible more of the same character .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 The essay seems hardly one of the ^ r ^ Mabie staple literary forms nowadays , un - less explained by something special in treatment or thesis , something authoritative in the point of view .

		Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	justifies his '' Essays on Nature and Culture '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- by the particular quality of sincerity .

		To him ,
Na	LOCATION	- ture is what she was in the poetic childhood of the race , and what he believes she will '' some day be - come in the vision of science a sublime analogy of the growth of man . ''

		Art and science are not strange words in his pages , but they are subservient ; the arts are comprehended in the art of living , and the sciences , over and above their material phenom - ena , are only making toward a finer faith in the ulti - mate wisdom of it all .

		The dedicatee of the volume , it is to be noted , is Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, for whom Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	would hardly have concerned himself to collect evidences of what is evil or unadmirable in nature .

		Instead , the wonder of the growth of trees , the unfolding of flowers , are still miracles to teach the illimitable prophecies of the world , the '' unfolding of all the possibilities of the spirit , '' which is culture .

		Forty years ago , in this country , this book would have been written very differently , or not at all ; to-day it multiplies initiative and corrective influences among people who only need their own impulses re-worded to be wakened into better things .

		The style now and then seems to grow impersonal , like a sermon , and just a bit rhe - torical ; but that may well be because it moves on so high a plane .

		Of the making of French books on
America	LOCATION	, there has been no end since ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	'' set the pace for his compatriots with his '' Brother
Jonathan	PERSON	. ''

		So far as our experience goes , he who has read '' Brother Jonathan '' has virtually read the rest ; for the rest mainly ring the changes on their original .

		One is merely more or less smart , flippant , ejaculatory , or patronizing -LRB- and the spectacle of one small French - man patronizing this country rather recalls Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	's adventure with the
Atlantic	LOCATION	-RRB- , than the other ; and that is all .

		The latest
Gaul	PERSON	to point his quill at us and favor us with his airy patronage is
M. S. C. de Soissons	PERSON	, author of '' A Parisian in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		From this book one gets the impression that M. de
Soissons	LOCATION	is extremely well satisfied with himself arid pretty well satisfied with us .

		He treats us kindly , on the whole though with that '' certain condescension '' which we have long ceased to be truly thankful for , and which we have known to bring more than one usually sane citizen to the verge of Jingoism for the time being .

		Our national good-humor -LRB- despite Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	and his friends -RRB- is proverbial , and Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has made much of it ; but no democratically-minded man can stand being patronized .

		Better abuse than conde - scension ; better the undisguised vinegar of down - right Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	, than the treacle of , say , Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Those Good Normans , '' by '' Gyp , '' translated by Miss
Marie Jussen	PERSON	-LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will prob - ably be found in some degree amusing by all readers .

		Although based on the not unusual theme of semi - wealthy people trying to make themselves considered in society , yet the setting , if we may so call it , as well as the development and the dialogue , is so cleverly man - aged as to be the source of much pleasure .

		It must be allowed that a good deal of the sprightly
Countess	ORGANIZATION	's satire loses point if one be not somewhat familiar with French life ; and the translation will not always , we think , give the right idea to one unacquainted with the French language .

		Still , the inexhaustible invention and cleverness of '' Gyp '' will overcome even these draw - backs , so that those for whom the translation is ob - viously made will probably enjoy it , while it will not materially injure those who could read the book in the original .

		Mr.
Raymond A. Robbins	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, is the publisher of the book of the '' Captive '' of Plautus , prepared for the presentation of the play last
spring	DATE	by the students of the
Boston University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book gives the Latin text and English translation on opposite pages ; the lat - ter , by Professor
Joseph R. Taylor	PERSON	, being extremely modern and colloquial in diction .

		For example : `` Abi in malem rem , ludis me , '' becomes '' To perdition !

		You 're making game of me . ''

		Greek phrases are repro - duced in German , to get the effect of the foreign lan - guage .

		The English version is extremely readable , and has caught the spirit of the play most happily .

		Mr.
Charles Johnston	PERSON	, of the
Bengal Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, has made a little volume of selections '' From the Upanishads '' -LRB-
Mosher	PERSON	-RRB- which will be welcomed by amateur orientalists .

		They contain the very essence of Indian philosophy , as embodied in its deepest books .

		In a beautiful dedication to Mr.
G. W. Russell	PERSON	-LRB- the A. E. of '' Homeward '' -RRB- the translator says of the books of Indian Wisdom : `` I have found them wise , beyond all others ; and , beyond all others , filled with that very light which makes all things new ; the light discovered first within , in the secret place of the heart , and which brim - ming over there fills the whole of life , lightening every dark and clouded way . ''

		It is not so much the scholar - ship displayed by the book as the taste shown in the selection and the exquisite delicacy of the English ver - sion that will make those cherish it into whose hands it may
fall	DATE	.

Ernst Curtius	ORGANIZATION	, who died on the

		He was a professor at
Gottingen	LOCATION	from
1856	DATE	to
1868	DATE	, and after - wards at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		He was chiefly responsible for the German excavations at
Olympia	LOCATION	.

		Besides his great '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' he wrote many other works in the department of classical history , philology , and archae - ology .

		The sudden death , in the prime of life , of
William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	, is a loss to American art and litera - ture alike .

		He was born
October 5 , 1850	DATE	, and died on the sixteenth of
last month	DATE	.

		He first became widely known through the natural history articles , illustrated by himself , that appeared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' some years ago .

		These articles , and others , were after - wards collected in a number of the most charming books of natural history ever written , of which '' Sharp Eyes '' and '' Nature 's Serial Story '' are perhaps the best known .

		His last book was the beautifully illustrated volume on '' Our Edible Mushrooms , '' one of the most conspicuous holiday publications of the past season .

		We are glad to call the attention of our readers to the '' Cumulative Index to a Selected List of Period - icals , '' now being issued in monthly parts by the
Cleve	PERSON	- land
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over fifty English and American periodicals are regularly indexed , while important arti - cles in a number of others will also be noted .

		The '' In - dex '' is on the plan of a dictionary catalogue , authors and subjects being included in a single alphabet .

		The most valuable feature of this work is , however , that indicated by the first word of the title .

		Each monthly issue of the '' Index '' will contain not only the entries for that particular mouth , but also all the others that have accumulated during the year .

		Thus , the
Decem	PERSON	- ber number will refer to the contents of the selected periodicals for the entire year .

		Although publication of the work began with
June	DATE	, it is promised that the issue for next
December	DATE	shall be for the year
1896	DATE	com - plete .

		This plain statement of the work to be done by the '' Index '' will show , better than any words of praise , how great a help it will be to all literary workers , and how deserving of support is the enterprise .

St. Clair Pa	ORGANIZATION	- pers '' and other historical works , died at his home in
Lake Forest	LOCATION	, 111. ,
July 27	DATE	, in his sixty-third year .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was a life-long student of history , especially the political history of his own country , with which he was very familiar , and on which he made numerous contri - butions to the magazines and periodicals , including many valuable reviews in the pages of THE DIAL .

		He was also a life-long journalist , one of the better class whose work and influence can ill be spared from Amer - ican journalism .

		He began as editor of a country news - paper in

W. D. Howells	PERSON	in that humble field , and rose to the position of
General Manager of the Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	, which he held for over twenty years , resigning it in
1893	DATE	in order to devote his time to the historical work that so much engaged his scholarly interest .

		The rest and relief from business which he had so long promised him - self came , however , too late ; his health , already under - mined , failed rapidly under the shock of the loss of his wife and daughter , occurring in swift succession .

		His death leaves unfinished the most important work of his life , '' The Political History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' as also a life of President
Hayes	PERSON	, whose literary executor he was .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	had seen much of public life and men , having been Secretary of State of

		BRIEFER MENTION 98 LITERARY NOTES ... 98 A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE IL The German writers most talked about at the present day are the dramatists
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann and
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		At least , this is the opinion of Dr.
Zimmermann	PERSON	, who opens his annual summary of German literature with a discussion of their latest works .

		The former has produced `` Das Gliick im
Winkel	PERSON	, '' a great success , while the ''
Florian Geyer	PERSON	'' of the lat - ter has proved a comparative failure .


Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's play deals with a modern and domestic theme , presenting a problem , and leaving us in doubt as to whether it has been solved or not . ''


Florian Geyer	PERSON	, '' on the other hand , is a historical drama , the subject being taken from the Peasants
' War of 1525	DATE	.

		The work suggests ''
Gbtz von Berlichingen	PERSON	, '' and the two plays are thus contrasted : '' Both the men who gave their name to the plays were leaders in the Peasants ' War one of them ,
Florian von Geyer	PERSON	, by his own desire , the other ,
Gotz	PERSON	, in spite of himself .

		The former , who was really desirous to reform society , both in its head and members , remained with the peasants in good and ill fortune , and sacrificed life and property to their cause ; the latter , a mere im - promptu knight , deserted the cause of the peasants , and in the last decisive battle against the troops of the Swabian league at Konigshofen beat a disgraceful re - treat .

		In comparison with '
Gotz	PERSON	, '
Hauptmann	PERSON	's play has historical accuracy in its favor ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poetic probability .

		Goethe 's play acquires dramatic vigour and human interest by the interweaving of the Peasants ' War with the family and love relations of Weisslingen and Adelheid .


Hauptmann	PERSON	's , which clings with slavish accuracy to historic facts , and even models its language on the now unfamiliar speech of that day , leaves the impression of an historical chronicle in dialogue , and has a stunted and uninteresting effect . ''

		A third important play , also historical , comes from
Herr Ernst von Wildenbrach	PERSON	, and is called ''
Heinrich	PERSON	und Sein Geschlecht . ''

		It is a trilogy , and the performance requires two evenings .

		In it '' idealism in the sense of the classsic ancients , so much opposed to the ex - treme realism of the moderns , has won a tri - umph , '' says our writer .

		Turning to the sub - ject of poetry we read the following interesting statement : '' In the domain of epic poetry the appearance of a work of the extent , and , in spite of some excrescences , the profundity , of '
Robespierre	LOCATION	, ' by the youthful poet - ess
Marie Eugenie delle Grazie	PERSON	, which came out last 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, year , has driven all rivals out of the field for a long while to come .

		In the lyric domain also the publication of the same author 's collected poems secures for her the first place in the year 's literature . ''


Herr Martin Greif	PERSON	has begun an issue of his collected poems ; we read that as a lyric writer he '' occupies a foremost place , and though building on a loftier summit , he is akin to the unartificial comrades who , like
Hans Sachs	PERSON	,
spring	DATE	from the ranks of the people more closely akin to nature from the artisan , peasant , or even servant class . ''

		A word is also said of the sacred poetry of the peasant woman ,
Frau Johanna Ambrosius	PERSON	, and of the posthumous success of
F. W. Weber	PERSON	's ''
Dreizehn Linden	PERSON	, '' which is even compared with that of
Scheffel	PERSON	's famous '' Trompeter . ''

		The most noteworthy fiction of the year has been '' Im
Blauen Hecht	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	; '' Chlodovech , '' by
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	; ''
Ueber Allen Gipfeln	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Heyse	PERSON	; ''
Kittmeister Brandt	PERSON	, '' by
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	; and an unnamed novel by
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	.

		The novel of Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	'' takes its title from the name of the inn , ' Zum blauen
Hecht	PERSON	, ' at
Miltenberg	LOCATION	, in
Franconia	LOCATION	, whence sprang
Friedrich Weygand	PERSON	, the man who drew up for the peasants under the leader - ship of
Florian Geyer	PERSON	the future constitution of the German nation ...
Ebers	PERSON	is always suc - cessful in imparting local and temporal color - ing to his stories ; the stiffness tiresome at times so characteristic of his revenants from the ages of the Pharaohs and Ptolemies , is exchanged in this work , as in the previous one dealing with a German imperial city , for an attractive fluency of style and characterization . ''

		On the other hand , '' Chlodovech '' is said to be heavily ballasted with historic and archa3olog - ical learning .

		It is another story of the Volker - wanderung .

		The '' Mutter '' of
Frau Goswine von Berlepsch	PERSON	and the '' Seine Gottheit '' of
Frau Emilie Mataja	PERSON	are also novels deserving of mention .

		Weimar , once the literary metrop - olis , has now become the literary necropolis of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Owing to the establishment by the present Grand Duchess of the Goethe and
Schiller Archive	PERSON	, it has become the lasting treasure-house of the most precious heritage of German genius .

		The national undertaking , unique in its kind , of an absolutely complete collection of the works of the poet of '
Faust	PERSON	, ' at the head of which stands the Grand Duchess herself as heir to all the literary and artistic works left behind by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, assumes larger dimensions every year .

		The
Goethe Society	ORGANIZATION	, working with untiring energy , adds new treas - ures annually to the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Goethe literature , partly by means of its annual ' Jahrbuch , ' partly by original pub - lications . ''

		The latest volume of the great '' Sophia '' edition of Goethe -LRB- the eighteenth -RRB- '' contains a newly discovered fragment of a drama hitherto unknown , which was to bear the title '
Das Madchen von Oberkirch	PERSON	, ' the action being laid in
Alsace	LOCATION	at the time of the French Revolution ; but of this only a few scenes were written .

		This serves as a fresh proof of the care which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the ' unpolitical poet , ' de - voted to the poetical aspect of the greatest polit - ical event of his century . ''

		A new life of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, by
Herr Albert Bielschowsky	PERSON	, has been partly published , and '' comes forward with the de - clared intention of supplying a complete sub - stitute for the most vivid of Goethe biographies that by
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	, which has now become antiquated , in fact and driving it from the position it holds with general readers and Ger - man families . ''

		The '' Ausgewahlte Briefe '' of
Strauss	PERSON	is one of the books of the year . ''

		These letters , addressed for the most part to his friend
Vischer	PERSON	, extend from his twenty-second year -LRB- 1830 -RRB- to his death in
1874	DATE	, and thus include nearly the whole of his life .

		General readers will be specially interested in those which refer to the pugnacious schol - ar 's passionate affection for the opera singer
Agnes Schebest	PERSON	, Juno-like both inwardly and outwardly , and his marriage with her , which , happy at first , degenerated afterwards into tragedy .

		The mixture of harshness and softness so characteristic of the Swabian disposition ap - pears as an inherited racial characteristic in the writer the uncompromising intellect whose critical faculty knows no limits , and an over-tender heart which any un - wonted breath causes to withdraw , wounded , into itself .

		The latter then finds vent in appropriate poetic effu - sions , which are scattered throughout the letters , and reveal in the great stylist , whose prose is among the best of which the German language can boast , a poet who excels in feeling as much as in form . ''

		The letters of Count von
Roon	PERSON	to
Perthes	LOCATION	, and of Lassalle to
Herwegh	LOCATION	, have also been pub - lished , and are of much interest .

		It is also worth noting that
Herr B. von Simson	PERSON	has added a sixth volume to
Giesebrecht	ORGANIZATION	's great but incomplete ''
Geschichte der Deutschen Kaiserzeit	PERSON	, '' giving the history of
Friedrich Barbarossa	PERSON	as suggested by fragments left by Giesebrecht .

		The story of literary
Holland	LOCATION	is told this year by
Heer H. S. M. van Wickevoort Crommelin	PERSON	.

		In poetry , there is
Heer van Eeden	PERSON	's '' Lied van
Schijn en Wezen	PERSON	, '' a striking philosophical production , and volumes of lyrics by a number of writers .

		In philosophy there is
Heer Meins	PERSON	- ma 's monograph on
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, as well as two translations of the '' Ethica . ''

		There is also
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 Dr.
Jelgersma	PERSON	's '' De Ontkenning der Moraal , '' a defence of conventional morality against the theories of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most important novel of the year is the ''
Wereld	PERSON	- vrede '' of
Heer Couperus	PERSON	, a sequel to - '' Ma - jesteit . '' ''

		Othomar thinks he has found out what the world requires peace .

		This blessing he will bestow on his people , and he convokes a congress for international arbitration , which he opens under the enthusiastic ap - plause of the multitude .

		But Liparia is no Utopia , and as soon as the enthusiasm , in which a strong element of imitation and fashion plays its part , has died away , the people find that all the fine phrases uttered and all the words wasted have not lightened their burdens in the least .

		Instead of universal peace ensuing , an insurrec - tion breaks out in
Othomar	LOCATION	's dominions , and the em - peror has to extinguish his ideals in the blood of his own people . ''

		Other works of fiction are ''
Martha	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Aletrino	PERSON	; ''
Zijn Kind	PERSON	, '' by
Heer	PERSON	van Nouhuys ; '' De Vreemde Plant , '' by
Herr Phocius	PERSON	; and two historical novels in the period of the French Revolution , by Professor ten Brink .

		There seems to be nothing else in the report from
Holland	LOCATION	that is deserving of special mention .

		Passing to the Scandinavian countries , we notice with regret that
Sweden	LOCATION	is not included in the '' Athenaeum '' summaries of this year .


Denmark	LOCATION	, however , is dealt with by
Herr Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, and
Norway	LOCATION	by
Herr Christian Brinch	PERSON	- mann .

		Outside of belles-lettres ,
Denmark	LOCATION	has produced , few notable books .

		The most impor - tant , of course , is the great monograph on Shakespeare by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		As Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has translated this work into English , it is sure of finding a large public .

		Dr.
Alfred Lehmann	PERSON	's work '' On Superstition and Witch - craft '' is also of much importance . ''

		It is in many respects founded on the records of the English Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, without the aid of which the author could never have undertaken his task , though he has made a good many experiments on his own account .

		The author is devoting almost a whole volume to Spiritualism , which he considers partly as the result of self-suggestion , and partly as the outcome of tricks played by conscious impostors , although he ad - mits that there are phenomena which can not yet be explained from natural causes .

		He mentions the experi - ments of thought-transmission by Professor Sidgwick , but Dr.
Lehmann	PERSON	is a skeptic regarding the explanation of them . ''

		Coming to the subject of literature proper , the writer says : '' In general it must be said that the earlier form of realistic naturalism is slowly vanishing , or perhaps rather changing into something new .

		Even the leaders seem to feel that nothing more can be done that way .

		At the present moment there is less dogmatism in lit - erature than we have had for many a long year .

		Every - body may do what he likes , and if he is doing it well may expect to find an audience .

		There is a change of taste slowly going on , and much experimenting both in art and literature .

		Now and then the word symbolism is thrown into the discussion by one or other of the ex - perimenters , but there is no symbolistic school worth speaking of .

		There is no fixed line , indeed , between old and new , only a tendency . ''


Herr Jorgensen	PERSON	, a new writer who has recently become a convert to
Romanism	LOCATION	, `` has written a most beautiful book , ' Rejsebogen , ' in which he gives delicate pictures from old mediaeval Ger - man and Italian cities in a noble style , whose serenity recalls the painting of the old mas - ters . ''


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	, who is now living abroad , '' this year celebrates the completion of twenty-five years of authorship . ''

		He has pub - lished '' Kitzwalde , '' a mediaeval novel , and a volume of '' Melodramer . ''

		Other books are
Herr Pontoppidan	PERSON	's ''
Dommens Dag	PERSON	, ''
Herr Michaelis	PERSON	's '' ^ Ebelo , ''
Herr Peter Nansen	PERSON	's ''
Gud	ORGANIZATION	's Fred , '' and
Herr Carl Evald	PERSON	's '' Den
Gamle Stue	PERSON	, '' a story of emancipated woman . ''

		A young poet ,
Ludvig Holstein	PERSON	, has made a mark in literature with a beautiful volume of melodious verse , bright as the sunshine of
May	DATE	. ''


Norway	LOCATION	, it seems , has little but fiction to offer this year , although the greatest event chronicled is
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's play , the second part of '' Over JSvne . '' ''

		Twelve years ago appeared the first part .

		There he had forced us to realize the suffering involved in utter abandonment of self , over and beyond natural capacity , in the cause of religious enthusiasm .

		Now , in this sec - ond part , he leads us to feel with the political dreamers , themselves the offspring of those older martyrs who believed in miracles , their despair of any solution of the social questions , pointing , as they seem to do , to another fruitless martyrdom .


Bjornson	PERSON	has produced a drama of overwhelming force and effect , marked by varied delineation of human characteristics and clear analysis of social problems , and also full of genuine pathos and poetical touches .

		Weighed in a balance , it would turn the scale against most of our modern tragedies . ''

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	has published nothing , but his plays appear with biennial regularity , and one may be expected the coming winter .

		Herr Lie 's '' When the Sun Sets '' '' deals with the disas - trous influence on a home of the wife 's infi - delity , and shows at the end how the husband , at last suspecting his wife 's proceedings , ar - ranges matters in such a way that the next time she goes to meet her lover she can not fail to meet also certain death . ''

		Among works of scholarship , we may mention the '' Dictionary of Norwegian Dialects , '' by
Herr Ross	PERSON	, the late
Eivind Astrup	PERSON	's book on the
Peary Expedition	ORGANIZATION	,
Herr Olsvig	PERSON	's discussion of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's indebt - edness to English writers , and the essays of 82 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	,
Herr Nils Kjaer	PERSON	, which place the author in the forefront of Norwegian critics .

		The Hungarian books of the year seem to have been '' Fatum , '' a novel of Transylvanian life by Miss
Janka Horvath	PERSON	; '' The Lublo Ghost , and Other Stories , '' by Mr.
Kalman Mikszath	PERSON	; and ''
Honthy	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' a play by Mr.
Ferencz Herczeg	PERSON	, who brings out at least one new book every year .

		The Millenial Cele - bration has called forth '' Millenial Hungary , '' '' a highly interesting and splendidly got-up descriptive publication in four languages , En - glish among the rest . ''

		Four volumes of the great '' History of the
Magyar Nation	ORGANIZATION	'' have already appeared , and two or three more are to follow .


Herr Katscher	PERSON	says in a general way of modern Hungarian literature that it '' is characterized , not by the towering qualities of a single leading personality , but by what might be called a popular spirit approximating to general European forms , subjects , and styles .

		Young
Hungary	LOCATION	must be estimated by its total production , instead of by one or two names . ''

		The three Slavonic literatures remain to be considered , but we have space for only little con - cerning them .

		The Bohemian literature of the present day , writes Dr.
Tille	PERSON	, '' is characterized not so much by the actual works produced as by a movement which , although going on for some time , was never so marked as during the past year .

		This movement , which I should like to call ` youthful impulse , ' is not confined to any one class ; it is to be observed in all our literary circles , and varies in its principles and tendencies in different individualities and par - ties .

		Only one feature is common to all : the desire for a regeneration of literature , for re - formation , for new and better tendencies . ''

		The young men are trying to start a Theatre libre in
Prague	LOCATION	, and sustain several periodicals for the furtherance of their aims and theories . ''

		Vina , '' a drama by Mr.
Hilbert	PERSON	, a new writer , `` may be counted the best written in Bohemian . ''

		The most interesting news from
Poland	LOCATION	is that Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	has published a three - volume novel , '' Quo Vadis ? ''

		of which the '' first persecution of the Christians at
Rome	LOCATION	forms the background .

		Individual episodes , such as the burning of
Rome	LOCATION	, the gladiatorial combats , the martyr death of the Christians in the circus , etc. , are brilliant and described with wonderful plastic power , and the extremely numerous dramatis personce , mostly historical figures , are as notable for psychological truth as for fidelity to fact . ''


Madame Orzeszko	PERSON	, a writer of some thirty years ' standing , has added three books to her long list : '' An Australian , '' a novel ; '' Melancholy Beings , '' a collection of stories ; and '' The Interrupted Song , '' '' the prettiest tale '' she has ever written .

		The long list of other books given in Mr.
Belcikowski	PERSON	's enumeration contains nothing of noteworthy interest , and must be passed over .

		Mr.
Paul Milyoukov	PERSON	opens his article by saying : '' I can only liken the condition of Russian society this year to a river whose current has been suddenly stopped by some insuperable obstacle .

		The stream has not been sufficiently strong to break down the dam , nor so weak as to be stopped entirely , and thus by over - flowing the banks , to turn the surrounding country into a swamp . ''

		This is sufficiently discouraging , but seems to be borne out by the facts .

		What he says of the controversy raging between '' Populists '' and '' Marxites '' may be quoted : '' The first adhere to the old idea that the primitive collectivism of
Russia	LOCATION	is destined to become the founda - tion of the future structure of Russian industrialism ; while the others maintain that '
Russia	LOCATION	is no exception to other European countries , and must , like them , take leave of the period of natural cultivation , in which alone primitive forms of collective property-holding can be retained . ' ''

		In the field of pure literature , he says , '' this year has been one of the most barren .

		A large number of well-known authors have presented us with their works , but there is not a single remarkable production amongst them . ''

		Some remarks upon the writings of Mr.
Volynski	PERSON	are interesting for the light thrown upon criticism in
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		In his bulky volume on ' Russian Critics , '
Volynski	PERSON	endeavored in vain to turn public sympathy away from our veteran journalistic critics
Belinski	PERSON	,
Dobrolioubov	PERSON	, and Pissareff and to prove that these old favorites of the public had an inadequate philosophic equipment for their task .

		In reality Russian readers never valued highly any Russian critic who was the champion of any aesthetic theory , however philosophically grounded .

		Thanks to the melancholy conditions of Russian society , which still continue , the Russian critic , under cover of sestheticism , has always been a publicist , compelled to sail under a strange flag , and thus smuggle into print his contraband political and social opinions .

		Thus the very faults with which
Volynski	ORGANIZATION	reproaches our critics , and which would be serious defects in any society where a normal public opinion existed , are regarded as their principal merits by Russian readers . ''

		SIR
WILLIAM GROVE	PERSON	, who died on the
third of this month	DATE	, at the age of eighty-five , was a distinguished physicist , and one of the earliest writers to enunciate the doctrine of the correlation and conservation of the forces of nature .

		His name will always be associated with that of doctrine among students , and among labor - atory workers with the form of battery that bears his

		THE DIAL 83 Nefo TALES or TRAVEL , AND ADVENTURE .

		* No better book of sporting lore and reminis - cence has fallen in our way since the day when a happy chance buried us for an entire half - holiday afternoon in the breezy pages of old ''
Christopher	PERSON	in his Sporting Jacket '' than Mr.
W. A. Baillie-Grohman	PERSON	's finely illustrated '' Sport in the Alps , '' an account of the chase of the red-deer , chamois , bouquetin , roe-deer , capercaillie , and black-cock , in the Central ,
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	, and Italian Alps .

		Mr.
Baillie-Groh	PERSON	- man is a veteran hunter his acquaintance with the '' deadly tube '' dating from the time when as an urchin of seven he loaded a thimble -LRB- with touch-hole drilled in the bottom -RRB- with grains of '' villainous saltpetre '' pilfered from the paternal gun-room , and discharged the same , with delightful effect , against the glass panes of the nursery book-case .

		Copious as is the literary outcome of '' Alpinism , '' no consid - erable attempt has been made hitherto to write of the Alps strictly from the point of view of the sportsman ; and this void it was Mr.
Baillie	PERSON	-
Grohman	PERSON	's aim to supply .

		The Swiss Alps are left almost unnoticed , for the simple reason that but few chamois and no red-deer whatever are now to be found there .

		Republicanism and game-preserving assort ill together , constitu - tional regard for the Rights of Man securing to each free-born countryman of
Jean Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	, from landowner to landlouper , his natural and inalienable right to carry a gun and to shoot therewith what he pleases where he pleases a policy which , while soothing to democratic sensibilities , naturally resulted in the speedy extinction of game .

		To the Swiss '' proletarian , '' then , is left the dog-in - the-manger satisfaction of knowing that , if there is no game for him , neither is there any * SPORT IN THE ALPS , in the Past and Present .

		for his supposed social superiors .

		To some proud spirits this is doubtless true joy .

		Mr.
Baillie-Grohman	PERSON	-LRB- who has consorted much with
Grafs	ORGANIZATION	,
Herzogs	ORGANIZATION	, and so on -RRB- seems to be aristocratical enough in his notions to think it expedient that the killing of game in a country like
Switzerland	LOCATION	should be mainly the privi - lege of the class whose interests and instincts lead them to kill it in a rational and sports - manlike way , and to eschew the ruthless meth - ods of the vulgar pot-hunter but this smacks of heresy nowadays .

		Mr.
Baillie-Grohman	PERSON	's book is too diversified in matter to be fairly exhibited here ; but the following captions may help to indicate its general scope and trend : '' Chamois-hunting in the Old Days '' ; '' What the Chamois is Like '' ; '' Chamois-stalking in Peasants ' Shoots '' ; '' Stalking the Alpine Deer '' ; '' Stalking Red-Deer in
Hungary	LOCATION	'' ; '' The Bouquetin and its Chase , '' etc. .

		One of the best chapters contains some sporting rem - iniscences of the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg a mighty hunter , a just prince , a liberal Ma3 - cenas , and withal a true friend and father of his people , who rejoiced in his prowess and will long keep his memory green by the recital of his deeds and benefactions .

		The Duke was a superb shot ; and the ring of his favorite .450
Henry Express	ORGANIZATION	rifle was the sure knell of many and many a royal '' harte of grease '' and stag of ten .

		Once the author saw him bring down , with two double shots , four stags in full flight , the nearest of them over two hundred yards away .

		He died in
1893	DATE	perhaps a not alto - gether edifying example of the strength of the ruling passion ; for his last words were , '' Let the drive commence ! ''

		The good ''
Herr	PERSON	Her - zog '' was lamented far and wide by the hardy mountain people , whose rugged tastes and sin - ewy virtues of mind and body he had , and even embodied .

		Though above them , he was of them ; and they loved him accordingly .

		As the author was boarding the train , on his way to attend the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's funeral at
Coburg	LOCATION	, at a moun - tain station near the Hinter-Riss , a bare-legged little peasant girl , pale with fatigue , hurried up to him , pressed a bunch of toil-won Alpine gen - tians and rhododendrons into his hand , saying : '' ' They are the only ones I could find still in bloom , and I spent all day yesterday on the rocks to get them .

		Please put them on the .


Herr Herzog	PERSON	's coffin he was so fond of them ; and once he was so good to my mother , who died last month .

		I 've been walking pretty well all night to get here in time . '

		Among the multitude of gorgeous floral offerings from the crowned heads of
Europe	LOCATION	, which covered the coffin and the floor of the mortuary chapel where for the last time I saw the calm features of the great sportsman that little bunch 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, of half-withered Alpine flowers was certainly the hum - blest .

		But I know which would have pleased the dead prince most . ''

		An excellent publication is the handsome volume styled -LRB- not very luminously -RRB- `` From
North Pole	LOCATION	to Equator , '' being an English translation of the lectures , recently collected and published in
Germany	LOCATION	, of the lamented German naturalist-traveller ,
Alfred Edmund Brehm	PERSON	, author of '' Bird Life '' and the classic '' Tierleben . ''

		To the translation has been added an introductory essay on the author and his work , an extended table of contents , an ap - pendix containing some useful editorial notes , and a fair index .

		For range , charm , and va - riety , and as an example of picturesque pre - sentation of ordered scientific observations in natural history , the book seems to us unsur - passed by any work of its kind and scope .

		Comparing
Brehm	PERSON	with
Humboldt	PERSON	, the editor justly observes that we find in some of the latter 's Charakterbilder , for example in his '' Views of Nature , '' '' the prototype of those synthetic pictures which give
Brehm	PERSON	's popular lectures their peculiar value . ''

		Brehra 's de - scriptions of scenery , and of animal life and traits as seen in nature , are of the clear-cut order that imprint themselves durably on the mind as the seal stamps the wax .

		Once read , they are retained , and become part of one 's intellectual furniture .

		Brehm -LRB- 1829-1884 -RRB- was born at Unter - Renthendorf ,
Sachsen	LOCATION	-
Weimar	LOCATION	, where his father , an accomplished ornithologist , was pastor .

		Brought up in an atmosphere of bird-lore , and accustomed to at - tend his father on his specimen-hunting tramps in the Thuringian forest , young
Brehm	PERSON	insen - sibly and inevitably became a naturalist hap - pily not one of the mere Dryasdust sort , his inborn love of the poetic and the picturesque being nourished and kept alive by his mother , who used to enliven the evenings ' bird-stuff - ing and specimen-mounting operations at the JPfarr-haus by reading aloud from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	.

		In
1847	DATE	Brehm accompanied
Baron von Miiller	PERSON	on an ornithological expedition to
Africa	LOCATION	, returning in
1852	DATE	, rich in spoils and experience , if poor in coin , to spend several sessions at the universities of
Jena	ORGANIZATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		In
1855	DATE	he took his doctor 's degree , publishing in the same year his '' Relseskizzen aus Nor - dostafrika . ''

		Early in
1861	DATE	, after a zoological trip in
Spain	LOCATION	, he settled for a time at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, writing there for the '' Gartenlaube '' teaching , and composing his '' Bird Life . ''

		The monu - mental '' Tierleben '' was begun , after an expe - dition to
Abyssinia	LOCATION	, in
1863	DATE	, and completed in
1869	DATE	.

		Meanwhile ,
Brehm	PERSON	had served at Ham - burg as Director of the Zoological Gardens , and at
Berlin	LOCATION	in establishing the famous Aqua - rium which partly realized his pet project of '' a microcosmic living museum of nature .

		Ill - health , social friction , and strained business relations forced him to throw up his position , and he again took up the role of popular lec - turer , for which he was eminently qualified .

		His literary pursuits and lecturing were inter - rupted by his Siberian journeys and by occa - sional ornithological expeditions , notably those to
Spain	LOCATION	and
Hungary	LOCATION	, along with the Crown Prince
Rudolph	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	. ''

		But hard work , family sorrows , and finally , perhaps , the strain of a long lecturing tour in
America	LOCATION	, aged
Brehm	PERSON	before his time , and he died in
1884	DATE	.

		The fol - lowing passage from the characteristic chapter on '' Love and Courtship among Birds '' illus - trates
Brehm	PERSON	's manner , as well as his tendency , noted by the editor , to read the man perhaps unduly into the beast . ''

		All birds with a voice utter clear , articulate notes in their courtship , and their song is nothing more than a supplication of love ... He -LRB- the male bird -RRB- is a poet , who , within his own limits , invents , creates , and strug - gles for utterance ; and the motive throughout is love for the opposite sex .

		Dominated by this love , the jay sings , whistles , and murmurs , the magpie chatters , the croaking raven transforms its rough sounds into gentle , soft notes , the usually silent grebe lets its voice be heard , the diver sings its wild yet tuneful ocean-song , the bittern dips its bill under water that the only cry at its command may become a dull , far-sounding booming .

		... The bee-eater , whose voice is also unmelodious , sits for a long time on his perch , pressing closely to his mate , uttering scarcely a sound , but apparently content - ing himself with casting tender glances from his beau - tiful bright red eyes ; but he , too , takes fire , moves his wings abruptly , rises high into the air , describes a circle , utters a jubilant cry , and returns to his mate ... Tree-pipits and rock-pipits , white-throats , and garden - warblers behave exactly like the doves ; the wood - warblers precipitate themselves from their high perches without ceasing to sing , fly up again to another branch , where they finish their song , to begin it again a few minutes later , and bring it to a conclusion with a similar play of wings .

		Greenfinches , siskins , and common bunt - ings , in the enthusiasm of love , tumble in the air as if they had no control over their wings ; the larks soar to heaven singing their song of love ; the serin behaves as if it had taken lessons from a bat ... And such be - havior is only the movement of a machine obedient to some external guiding force ?

		All these expressions of a warm and living emotion which we have depicted occur without consciousness ?

		Believe that who can , maintain it who will .

		We believe and maintain the op - posite ; the conscious happiness of the love and wedded life of birds appears to us worthy of our envy . ''

		Other chapters treat of '' The Asiatic Steppes and their Fauna , '' '' The Steppes of Inner 1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85
Africa	LOCATION	, '' '' Migrations of Mammals , '' '' Apes and Monkeys , '' `` A Journey in
Siberia	LOCATION	, '' '' The Heathen Ostiaks , '' '' Family Life among the Kirghiz , '' etc. .

		The work contains a great num - ber of woodcuts from original drawings . ''

		The Downfall of Prempeh , '' consisting of the diary of Major
R. S. Baden-Powell	PERSON	, re - counts briefly the events of the recent British military expedition against the
King of the Ashantis	ORGANIZATION	.

		Major
Baden-Powell	PERSON	was in com - mand of the native levy ; and he prefaces his narrative with a pungent chapter , intended to make short work of the cavils of Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- berlain 's '' hecklers , '' setting forth the reasons for the undertaking , which were briefly these : '' To put a stop to human sacrifice .

		To put an end to slave-trading and raiding .

		To ensure peace and security for the neighboring tribes .

		To settle the country and protect the growth of trade .

		To get paid up the bal - ance of the war indemnity . ''

		That there were other and more vital reasons than these unimpeachable ones , some rather naive admissions in the Major 's amazing pre - face lead one to suspect .

		After quoting with approval the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	motto , '' Softly , softly , catchee monkey , '' he goes on to say , with an effrontery which is enough to send our Jingo statesmen into fresh spasms : '' By quietly taking possession of
Ashanti	ORGANIZATION	, it has prac - tically acquired the vast
Hinterland	LOCATION	beyond it has softly caught the monkey .

		And the principle is being carried out in all quarters of the world .

		In
Siam	LOCATION	, in
Venezuela	LOCATION	, and up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	goes softly , softly , catching her monkey . ''

		Thus do the worst suspicions of our Jingo friends meet confirmation assuming the au - thor to speak by the book .

		The
Ashanti	ORGANIZATION	expe - dition ended , as we know , prosperously in the abject submission of
King Prempeh	LOCATION	, who em - braced the knees of the envoy , and promised to abstain from slave-driving and his pet diver - sion of sacrificial slaughter for the future .

		There was no fight , much to the regret of the humane Major
Baden-Powell	PERSON	, who asserts that he was u spoiling '' for one throughout .

		How he might have felt about it had the delinquents marched against been
Oom Paul	PERSON	and his sharp - shooting boers , instead of
King Prempeh	PERSON	and his `` niggers , '' is a question ; for the
Transvaal	LOCATION	has fallen into some disrepute as a parade-ground for British valor of late .

		Reading the Major 's account of
Prempeh	LOCATION	, we ourselves rather regret that there was no fight ; for the
Ashanti	ORGANIZATION	chief seems to be a most faithless , bloody-minded rascal ; and it is clear that -LRB- as Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was once driven to say of a peculiarly pestilent rebel or was it place-hunter ? -RRB- ''

		a little shoot - ing might do him good . ''

		Kumassi -LRB- the '' death - place '' -RRB- ,
Prempeh	PERSON	's capital , was literally a
Golgotha	LOCATION	, possessing three places of execution , where the knife was seldom idle , and '' two blocks of houses occupied entirely by the exe - cutioners . ''

		Any public function served as the pretext for human sacrifices ; but if the king wanted some entertainment of the kind between - whiles , he did not look far for an excuse .

		De - siring on one occasion a richer color in the red stucco on the walls of his palace , he is said to have used as a vehicle the blood of four hundred virgins -LRB- presumably captives -RRB- for the purpose .

		At
Bantama	LOCATION	, a sacred village devoted to fetish sacrifices , was found the famous execution - bowl , described by Bowdich in his account of Kumassi in
1817	DATE	: '' It is a large brass basin some five feet in diameter .

		It is ornamented with four small lions , and a number of round knobs all round its rim , except at one part , where there is a space for the victim 's neck to rest on the edge .

		The blood of the victims was allowed to putrefy in the bowl , and leaves of certain herbs being added , it was considered a valuable fetish medicine . ''

		Inured thus to slaughter , it is no wonder that the
Ashantis	PERSON	became imbued with a consuming blood-lust , a wholesale execution being for them as alluring a spectacle as is a bull-fight to a Spaniard or a foot-ball match to an English - man .

		They were decidedly a people to be re - pressed , to be forced under the sway of the Pax Britannica whatever we may think of
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	's concurrent policy of '' softly , softly '' insinuating the germ of a claim to the '' vast
Hinterland	LOCATION	beyond . ''

		Prempeh 's overthrow was peaceably accomplished ; but Major
Baden	PERSON	-
Powell	PERSON	's account of him almost makes one wish there had been a little expiatory blood-letting .

		The book contains some striking illustrations .

		Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's compact volume on '' The Scenery of
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' is sure of its welcome among intelligent readers generally , and should prove a true boon to Alpine tour - ists .

		Swiss scenery has been duly described , sung , and apostrophized ; but it has not , we believe , heretofore been explained not , that is , for the direct behoof of the general reader .

		One 's enjoyment of it must needs be enhanced by a fair conception of the forces to which it is due , which have raised the mountains , hollowed out the lakes , and guided the rivers even if such knowledge bring with it a melancholy inkling of the inevitable outcome of the slow but potent counter-forces of denudation which must in time efface the rugged grandeur of the Alpine country , and pare down
Mont Blanc	PERSON	and the

		For the Alps themselves , the time - honored types of eternity , are ephemeral too though their day , measured with our brief span , seems a long one .

		They have already , says the author , '' undergone enormous denudation , and it has been shown that from the summit of Mont Blanc some ten to twelve thousand feet of strata have been already removed . ''

		The
summer of 1861	DATE	was spent by Sir
John	PERSON	in
Switzerland	LOCATION	with his friends Huxley and
Tyn	PERSON	- dall ; and since that date his vacation jaunts have usually been to the Alps .

		Thus he be - came interested in the problems offered by the physical geography of the country ; and it oc - curred to him that a book presenting in pop - ular style the latest conclusions of the best thinkers on those problems would be desirable .

		The present volume is the fruit of this idea ; and it should be in the hands of every Alpine tourist with a mind above
Baedeker	PERSON	mean - ing , of course , no slur on that excellent and indispensable finger-post .

		With
Baedeker	PERSON	as guide and Sir
John	PERSON	as philosopher and friend , the pilgrim to the land of Tell may cheerfully hope to make the most of his journey .

		The book is at once entertaining and instructive like other works of the author 's , a happy blend - ing of the popular and the technical .

		One of the finest works in our present group is Mr.
E. A. Fitzgerald	PERSON	's '' Climbs in the
New Zealand	LOCATION	Alps '' a superbly made book which inadequate space compels us to pass over much too briefly .

		It is a simple record of explora - tion and adventure , a tale of the privations , difficulties , hazards , and triumphs of moun - taineering , of the sort which the kindred ac - counts of Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	, Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	, and others have made us pretty familiar with .

		The author was accompanied by our old friend Mr.
Zurbriggen	PERSON	, the famous Swiss guide who so materially assisted Sir
M. Conway	PERSON	in the Kara - koram Himalayas .

		The most noteworthy climb was that of Mt.
Sefton	PERSON	, in the course of which the author narrowly missed falling down an abyss of some six thousand feet .

		A plate ac - companying the account of this lucky escape shows Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	dangling at the end of an alarmingly thin-looking rope over the gorge -LRB- down which his only hat is placidly sailing -RRB- , like the samphire-gatherer in ''
Lear	PERSON	, '' or a cap - tive cockchafer on a thread a most parlous predicament which ought to have cured him of the '' mountain-fever '' forever .

		Mts .

		Sealy ,
Tasman	ORGANIZATION	,
Haidinger	PERSON	, and the Silberhorn were also scaled .

		The story of the whole is admir - ably told , Mr.

Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, H. Gr .

		How PEOPLE LEARN TO COUNT .

		* Everyone who has read Tylor 's '' Primitive Culture '' must have been delighted with the chapter on the Art of Counting .

		In his work on '' The Number Concept , '' Dr.
Conant	PERSON	goes much more fully into the subject , and undoubt - edly brings together the greatest amount of illustrative material ever gathered .

		It appears quite certain that primitive man must have had extremely vague and meagre number concep - tions ; peoples even yet exist who have no words for numbers beyond two or three , indeed , it is asserted that the Bolivian Chiquitos have no real numerals at all , expressing simply the idea of unity by a word meaning alone , etama .

		It is quite possible that some animals have as clear a notion of number differences as have the De - mara , the Chiquito , and some Australians .

		From such poor beginnings of mathematical power man has moved onward .

		Many peoples , to keep their count straight and to focus atten - tion , have used their fingers and toes as tallies .

		While this has been and is common , curious differences exist in the exact method employed .

		After a discussion of counting in general , our author investigates the '' Limits of Number Systems . ''


South America	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and some
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	, show limits soon reached .

		Many peoples stop their count at two , some go to three , a multitude do not pass ten .

		Curiously , a considerable number of Australian tribes can count four , but do not go to the -LRB- to us -RRB- very natural five .

		Still some '' savage '' races -LRB- the word is Dr.
Conant	PERSON	's -RRB- go far in num - ber . ''

		In the great majority of cases '' they '' have the ability to count at least as high as ten . ''

		This limit is often extended to twenty , and not infrequently to one hundred .

		Again we find one thousand as the limit , or perhaps ten thousand ; and sometimes the savage car - ries his number system on into the hundreds of thousands or the millions .

		The origin of some number words can be * THE NUMBER CONCEPT .

		Its
Origin and Development	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Levi Leonard Conant	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL made out , but many of the names for small numbers do not tell their own story .

		This is particularly true for the numeral words of higher peoples : those of lower tribes are often quite transparent .

		High numbers are quite com - monly expressed by words compounded of the names of lower terms .

		This compounding may begin far down , and even three and four may be expressed by compounds , such as two-one , one-two , two-two , or second-two .

		Compounds may be produced too either by addition , as in our own language , where forty-two means two and forty ; or by subtraction , as in
Latin	LOCATION	, where duodeviginti means twenty minus two .

		Where finger-counting prevailed , it is natural that five should be called by the word for hand , and that its multiples should show evidence of finger counting , or of finger-and-toe tallying .

		So in Arawak -LRB-
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- dialects , we find dbbatek - habe = one hand = five ; biamanteMbbe = two hands = ten ; and abba - lulcku = hands = feet = twenty .

		In Kiriri -LRB-
South America	LOCATION	-RRB- twenty is expressed as mikriba misa idecho ibi sm = both hands together with the feet .

		Twenty is often the word man , showing that the whole natural counting-board has been gone over .

		Often mul - tiples of twenty are consistently expressed as so many men .

		Thus , in Maipure -LRB-
South America	LOCATION	-RRB- , they say papita camonee = one man = twenty ; forty is two men , sixty is three men , etc. .

		Some - times numeral words are simple descriptions of the act done with the finger on which they fall in the counting ; sometimes they are the names of the fingers themselves . ''

		Often some characteristic word , not of hand derivation , is found '' as a numeral .

		In Yoruba -LRB-
Africa	LOCATION	-RRB- ogodzi = a string = forty , be - cause forty cowry shells made '' a string '' in trade ; Maori e & cm = bunch = ten , because yams and fish were sold in bunches of ten .

		The words for one and two are sometimes simply '' this '' and '' that . ''

		A suggestion from nature often gives a numeral word ; things always occurring in pairs easily give '' two . ''

		The Abipone , for four , says '' toes of an ostrich '' ; for five he uses the name of a hide , which always presents a five - color pattern .

		After devoting two chapters to the origin of number words , Dr.
Conant	PERSON	gives the following suggestive table : 1 = existence , piece , group , beginning .

		2 = repetition , division , natural pair .

		3 = collection , many , two-one .

		4 = two-twos .

		5 = hand , group , division .

		6 = five-one , two-threes , second-one .

		7 = five-two , second-two , three from ten .

		8 = five - three , second-three , two from ten .

		9 = five-four , three-threes , one from ten .

		10 = one group , two hands , half-a-man , one-man .

		15 = ten-five , one-foot , three-fives .

		20 = two-tens , one-man , two-feet .

		To us , a decimal system seems so natural that we are likely to forget that other bases than ten for number systems may and do exist .

		A basis of some kind , a point in the count where we begin again with a higher order of numerals , is necessary if numbers are to be much developed .

		The number of bases either actually used or theoretically proposed for sys - tems is considerable .

		The great
Leibnitz	PERSON	de - sired to introduce a system of numeration where only the two figures , 1 and 0 , should be used .

		True binary systems are common enough , especially in
Australia	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	.

		Where developed so highly as to run up to six , the words in such a system will be on the plan one , two , two-one , two-two , two-two-one , two - two-two .

		Ternary and quaternary scales are less common .

		The assertion has been made that systems based upon four were once com - mon in
Central Asia	LOCATION	; very curious and com - plicated systems of the sort are found in
Hawaii	LOCATION	and the
Marquesas Islands	LOCATION	.

		Traces of a senary system are shown in our terms used in regard to dice ; and survivals of systems based on twelve and sixty duodecimal and sexigesimal systems are found in our selling by dozens and grosses , and in our time reckoning and circular measurement .

		From time to time a consistent return to twelve as a basis for a nu - meral system is urged by reformers among our - selves .

		But while systems based on two , three , four , six , eight , twelve , sixty may be found , and while they present much of interest , the com - mon systems of the world at large are the quin - ary , decimal , and vigesimal , based on five , ten , and twenty .

		This naturally results from finger-and-toe count . ''

		Whether or not the principal number base of any tribe is to be twenty seems to depend entirely upon a single consideration : are the fingers alone used as an aid to counting , or are both fingers and toes used ?

		If only the fingers are employed , the resulting scale must become decimal if sufficiently extended .

		If use is made of the toes in addition to the fingers , the outcome must inevitably be a vigesimal system .

		Subordinate to either one of these , the quinary may and often does appear .

		It is never the principal base in any extended system . '' ''

		A pure quinary or vigesimal system is ex - ceedingly rare . ''

		The Betoya scale is perhaps as good an example as any of a quinary sys - tem : Five = hand ; ten = two hands ; fifteen = three hands ; twenty = four hands .

		No European na - tion uses a true quinary system .

		Scales where numbers up to ten are made on a quinary base 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, and then present a combination of quinary and decimal are common , and the author presents examples from many peoples of almost all con - tinents .

		Vigesimal scales are known in
Europe	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The French and Danish are cases in point .

		We ourselves talk of scores , and man 's life is '' three score years and ten . ''

		In
Asia	LOCATION	such systems are far more common .

		Many languages of the
Caucasus	LOCATION	present such .

		Those of the
Tschukshi	PERSON	and the Ainu are nearly per - fect .

		Nowhere are there more perfect viges - imal systems , however , than in
America	LOCATION	.

		The languages of
Mexico	LOCATION	, Yucatan , and
New Gran	LOCATION	- ada present good specimens . ''

		The scale is just as regular by twenties in
Maya	LOCATION	as by tens in English . ''

		Thus : 20 = kal .

		20kal = bak = 400 .

		20 bak = pic = 8000 .

		20 pic = calab = 160000 .

		20 calab = kincb.il = 3200000 .

		20 kinchil = alau = 64000000 .

		A brief review can give little idea of the interest of Dr.
Conant	PERSON	's book .

		We have only indicated the treatment .

		The author 's style is simple , lucid , attractive .

		Although in subject somewhat technical , in method scholarly , and with much tabular material , the book will in - terest even the ordinary reader .

		To mathe - matics it is an important contribution ; to eth - nography and culture history it is a mine of valuable information .

		complete and absolute , we not only rule out religion , we rule out rational life as well .

		If we give an uncritical form and ready admission to the super - natural , our faith takes on constantly a supersti - tious , irrational , and unproductive cast .

		To com - pletely maintain the laws of action implanted in our physical and our intellectual constitution , and yet to maintain in the world and in ourselves that true personal and spiritual power which alone makes these laws significant for us , is the summation of sound philosophy . ''

		Old Faiths and New Facts , '' by Dr.
W. W. Kinsley	PERSON	, is a book of marked ability .

		It considers the relation of these two elements of our lives the natural and the supernatural in connection with prayer , with the personality of Christ , and with immortality .

		It is addressed to the intelligent be - liever , with the purpose of making his belief at once more reposeful and more exhilarating .

		We should say of it that the lines of thought offered are sound rather than critical .

		The author feels more dis - criminatingly the reasons which make for his posi - tions than those present in comparatively few minds which make against them .

		He does not at least so it seems to us sufficiently curb the supernatural to bring it into the full service of reason .

		As that is the task which the bolder thinking of our time has undertaken , any failure to feel its need very much weakens even the soundest defence of this essential term of our spiritual life .

		The author finds himself committed apparently to every alleged miracle of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and so unduly burdened in the discussion .

		Our faith needs to be purged and puri - fied on the side of the supernatural , and widely strengthened and sustained on the side of the natu - ral , before it can be that rational power which spreads a world of noble activities before us , and fully kindles the inner courage essential for their enjoyment .

		There is much in the volume to be com - mended .

		Mr.
Brownson	PERSON	's '' Faith and Science '' follows another vein running in the same direction .

		It is an effort toward the reconciliation of faith and sci - ence , religion and philosophy , by rendering the common grounds of all knowledge .

		This the author does with the zest of a metaphysician .

		He shows the confidence and strength of one who feels sure of the most general and permanent relations of truth .

		The book is refreshing , indicating as it does that not quite all have lost confidence in the mind itself , or confidence in the product of thought as accumu - lated by the past centuries .

		The race has not passed through a growth of vagaries , and then at length , with a sudden burst of power , planted its feet on firm ground .

		If there is any one thing for which we remain indebted to the Catholic faith , it is this hold on the past this tap-root of an historic sense of the continuity of the divine mind and methods .

		The counterpart of this truth , that the past must flow freely with ready change into the present and future , is not so well rendered .

		THE DIAL 89 the volume is penetrative , discursive , and historic , but is not likely to interest those who have drawn away from this form of thought .

		The intuitionalist , though he may find some difficulty with the exact way in which the power of the mind to seize and understand its own is presented , will certainly take pleasure in the fundamental idea .

		The author is appreciative of the contribution to knowledge of our time . ''

		Though our men of science , both by precept and ex ?

		tuple , have done their best to prove science impos - sible ai : < i to efface all radical distinction between man and the br ^ te , and really have proved that rationalism left to itself soon ceases to be rational , their labors have not been in vain , and by their unwearied industry they have amassed abundant and invaluable materials for the construction of the sciences which the philosopher has hitherto lacked '' -LRB- pag ^ 111 -RRB- . ''

		The Expansion of Religion '' a volume of
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	is admirable in purpose and thoroughly well executed .

		The title clearly ex - presses the object of the author to indicate the growing ways in whicu a truly religious feeling is taking posession of the woild for its guidance and correction .

		This assertion of expansion is not true of any single dogmatic faith , but is preeminently true of that spiritual frame of mind which underlies all religious life .

		The book widens out its discus - sion in the direction of spiritual belief ?

		, personal character , social structure , and organized religious action .

		Its temper is a wise , sober , progressive one , which we can heartily commend .

		The dominant thoughts of the lectures are : the prosperity of the individual as wrapped up in that of the community , and personal life as the power of religious truth .

		These are brought out everywhere with clearness and firmness . ''

		Christ 's Trumpet-Call to the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
D. S. Gregory	PERSON	, is a very full and forcible putting of the case as to the importance and authority of the ministry in proclaiming Christianity . ''

		Direct and effective Gospel preaching '' is with it '' the imme - diate salvation of the world . ''

		The volume rests on the supernatural character of Christian faith .

		Natu - ral agents and methods receive but meagre recog - nition .

		Indeed , the hortatory temper in religion almost always implies supernatural terms of action , supernatural aids to such action , and divine re - sponses under it .

		The author and men of a kindred outlook , thoroughly as they may be in earnest in a renovating work , seem to forget that the best of preaching has issued in only qualified success ; that the obstacles to progress lie as deeply imbedded in
Christendom	LOCATION	as in heathendom , and that if we were to select any , the best body of believers , we should still find in them only the germs of the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		The supernatural , separating itself from a wide discussion of the natural conditions and methods of growth in society , leaves society in a very inadequate , fitful , and uneven response to the duties which organize men in the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		A preacher may say admirable things in an emphatic way , and still find his audience but partially responsive .

		The remedy is not found in a more stentorian tone .

		Dr.
Gregory	PERSON	's presentation , though carefully wrought out , is weakened by this underlying assumption . ''

		The Mind of the Master , '' by the Rev.
John Watson	PERSON	-LRB-
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	-RRB- , is designed to draw pre - eminent attention to the words of Christ as the very substance of the Gospel message , and to put some - what in the background the teachings that accom - pany them and the dogmas that have arisen in con - nection with them .

		This is virtually a return toward the natural .

		If we meet Christ simply as a medium of truth , a higher form of life , we are at once at work under the laws of our own spiritual constitu - tion ; the natural and the supernatural , the deter - minate methods of growth and that insight and lib - erty which enable us to employ them , begin to flow together in a product of conduct and character , as firm as the physical and as free as the spiritual world .

		The volume is made up of a series of phases of truth associated with Christ , such as : '' The Sov - ereignty of Character , '' '' Devotion to a Person the Dynamic of Religion , '' '' Optimism the Attitude of Faith . ''

		The work is done with fine insight , a subtle spiritual temper , and decided literary excellence .

		The volume is one to which the reader may return in many moods of mind , with much pleasure .

		The last two of the volumes on our present list are closely associated .

		The first of them , '' The Religious Forces of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
H. K. Carroll	PERSON	, is a very full and carefully analytic statement of the various forms of religious faith in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Carroll	PERSON	had charge , in the eleventh census , of the statistics of churches .

		Not only are the general facts given , they are made clear and forceful by tracing their precise form and productive causes . ''

		Classification of the Churches , '' '' The Causes of Division , '' '' The Distribution of the Several Forms of Faith , '' `` The Evangelical and Non-Evangelical Elements , '' `` The Negro in his Relations to the Church , '' are a portion of the explanatory topics .

		The work is a complete pre - sentation of the familiar but confused fact of the manifold forms of religious belief in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The last volume , '' Church Unity , '' is a plea in correction of a widespread and obvious evil .

		It is made up of five discourses delivered in
Union Theo	LOCATION	- logical Seminary , by as many members of leading churches , all of them representative men : Dr.
Charles W. Shields	PERSON	, Dr.
E. Benjamin Andrews	PERSON	, Dr.
John F. Hurst	PERSON	, Dr.
Henry C. Potter	PERSON	, Dr.
Armory H. Bradford	PERSON	.

		The preface lays emphasis on the '' concord of opinion '' between these divines , each pursuing his own line of thought .

		The division of the natural and the supernatural is involved in this topic , as in the previous ones .

		Only on the supposition of an adequate and author - itative dogma given by revelation can we expect to return to church unity in connection with a creed .

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, We should deem it preposterous to push for unity in matters of science or philosophy , by accepting as ultimate certain primary principles .

		The intellect is necessarily analytic and divisive in its action .

		Whatever unity is possible to it can only be reached by pushing onward in endless activity through and beyond the more partial and more variable aspects of truth .

		Activity means , and must always mean , diversity .

		This diversity is natural , is inevitable , is desirable ; it lies in the breadth of the topic and the diffusion of thought .

		The unity of the churches under natural law is not the unity of a creed , but the unity of an end pursued by all paths , through all creeds , and with the aid of every rite .

		The Kingdom of Heaven can not be anticipated by a formal construction .

		It must have the diversity and vitality in every part of it of a free living organism .

		In spite of the preface , the '' concord of opinion '' is not apparent in these lectures , or in their several parts .

		The undeniable fact , the need of unity among Christians , and the very disputable idea that the
Chicago	LOCATION	Lambeth articles are an open means to this end , are not reconciled in the discussions .

		Unity , growing out of concurrent action for the coming of the Kingdom , is one thing ; and a formal unity , less or greater , under the articles of a creed , is another and very different thing .

		The relation of the two is not thoroughly elucidated .

		Some of the lectures have the one chiefly in view , and some the other .

		The two things seem to us incapable of being united .

		The one form of unity relegates the creed to a secondary position ; the other conspicuously retains it as a primary factor .

		The presentation of Dr.
Shields	PERSON	is not easily harmonized with that of Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	, while the intermediate lecturers are not careful to reconcile the two fundamental methods .

		The several lectures of which the volume is com - posed are of the best .

		Against the spirit of the discussion we have not a word to say .

		Our only difficulty with it lies in the feeling that the result implicitly involved in it must be perfectly formal .

		So far as it should prove efficacious , it would be likely also to prove hurtful by deadening that ac - tivity of thought which is , after all , genetic in the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		These discourses , however , have much of that temper which subordinates belief to action , and here we most heartily agree with them .

		The unity which is coming to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	must be found by picking up its hopes , and casting them , with one mighty fling , forward into the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 considerable , that the '' Saracinesca '' books are in most respects easily distanced .

		One finds in ''
Rome	LOCATION	'' the evidence of wide reading , supplemented by enough direct observation to give vitality to the narrative .

		A guide-book to the topography , ancient and modern , of the city , a summary of its history and its art , a study of its economic and social con - ditions , and , above all else , a searching analysis of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in its latter-day workings and signifi - cance , are all embraced in
M. Zola	LOCATION	's magnificent scheme .

		To these features the private and personal interest of the characters are strictly subordinated ; the story of ecclesiastical intrigue and wire-pulling has the first place , and the tragic love-story is of only subsidiary importance .

		The chief figure is that of the Abbe '' Froment , whom we learned to know in '' Lourdes . ''

		Shaken in his faith and utterly dis - heartened by contact with the display of gross super - stition witnessed at the
Grotto	LOCATION	, he returns to
Paris	LOCATION	in search of a new religious ideal .

		This he soon finds in a somewhat nebulous sort of Christian so - cialism , and he pictures to himself a regenerated Church in harmony with the teachings and practice of primitive Christianity .

		His ideal presently pro- jects itself into a book , ''
Rome Nouvelle	PERSON	, '' which embodies all the ardent aspiration of his youthful and deeply religious soul .

		But the book finds slight favor with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and he learns , to his dismay , that it is about to be placed in the Index .

		He hastens to
Rome	LOCATION	to plead his cause , and the whole novel is the story of his efforts to gain a hearing .

		As the weeks lengthen into months , while he is put off on one pretext after another , and sent from dig - nitary to dignitary in his quest , his spirits fail him , and a sort of moral disintegration sets in , which is furthered by his ever-deepening sense of the con - trast between the ideal Church of which he has dreamed and the real Church which he gradually comes to know in its chief stronghold and in the per - sons of its chief representatives .

		The situation is that of a nineteenth-century Luther , but a Luther who in the end submits , as far as the externals go , and reprobates his own work .

		We leave him seemingly crushed by the machinery that has been brought to bear upon his will , yet not without signs of an inward
spring	DATE	that is likely in the future to shape his life to a deeper and more lasting revolt than the one now in appearance subdued .

		M. Zola has often shown himself a master of irony , but never before so triumphantly as in the scene of the long-sought audience with the Holy Father , when the priest makes his submission , seemingly persuaded of the error of his ways , but in reality more deeply than ever before in antagonism with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		As he utters the formula of self-reprobation , there is shap - ing itself deep in his heart the feeling that his dream of a regenerated Church was indeed an idle one , that the old vessel would crack were the new wine poured into it . ''

		Rome '' is a book calculated to cause much controversy .

		Its weight seems , on the whole , to be thrown against the Church ; yet the argument for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is stated with great force , and the author , although he must be taken as the champion of positivism , has enough of the historic sense to write a book as widely as possible separated from anti-religious polemics of the shallow Vol - tairean type .

		The author has set himself as a task to see the whole of his subject , and to see it as steadily as possible ; when we consider what that subject is , it may fairly be said that he has achieved a reasonable degree of success .

		It should be added that there is little of what we commonly think of as '' Zolaism '' in the book ; with the exception of a single scene that , in spite of its power , good taste must condemn , there is nothing to give serious offense .

		The book is a far finer production than '' Lourdes , '' for which fact the subject-matter is not alone responsible .

		We see the French Revolution from a new point of view in '' The Reds of the Midi , '' a novel trans - lated from the
Provencal of M. Felix Gras	ORGANIZATION	by Mrs.
Janvier	PERSON	.

		M. Gras tells the story of the famous
Marseilles	LOCATION	battalion that marched to
Paris	LOCATION	with its new war-song , filled the hearts of the revolutionists with fresh courage , and took part in the attack on the Tuileries on the Tenth of
August	DATE	.

		The story is placed upon the lips of a peasant , a participant in the march , who in his old age relates it to a circle of eager listeners .

		History has treated these Mar - seilles patriots very unfairly , representing them as cutthroats and escaped galeriens .

		It has been a leading motive with the author to rehabilitate their fame , and recent historical investigations justify his partisanship .

		M. Gras himself is an exceedingly interesting character , and no part of the book is more readable than the biographical introduction contributed by Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	.

		He tells us that
M. Gras	PERSON	was born a little over half a century ago , that he attempted law and abandoned it for literature , that he became associated with the Felibrige , and is now its capouliS , or head , the successor of Rou - manille , who succeeded Mistral .

		He has published epic and other poems , and stories of old-time Avig - non , and has written -LRB- but not yet published in the original Provencal -RRB- the romance now translated , which is thus given to the world for the first time in English dress .

		It is a noteworthy piece of story - telling , and Mrs.
Janvier	PERSON	's English is so good as to make it difficult to believe the work to be other than an original .

		One of the most remarkable French novelists now living ,
M. Edouard Rod	PERSON	, is introduced to the Amer - ican public by '' The White Rocks , '' a translation of one of his most charming stories .

		M. Rod is a Swiss writer , which brings him into comparison with the veteran novelist ,
M. Cherbuliez	PERSON	; and his work will bear the comparison fairly well , for it is deeper and more convincing , although less animated and inventive .

		M. Rod 's closest affinity is , however , with
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	, for both have the same psy - chological method , the same critical faculty , and the same seriousness of purpose . ''

		The White Rocks '' is a study of Swiss provincial life , and its leading figure is a young Protestant pastor , whose peasant 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, origin makes it impossible for him fully to acquire the manner of men delicately bred , but whose essen - tial nobility of character wins the admiration of those who look beneath the surface of a man 's per - sonality .

		Temptation comes to him in the shape familiar to French novels , but he conquers it man - fully , although the act of renunciation costs him the bitterest struggle of his life , and his horizon at the close of the book is left well nigh cheerless .

		As a study of the pettiness of provincial manners and ideals the book is full of subtle touches , and will repay a close examination .

		Even the lesser char - acters , of whom there are many , are distinctly indi - vidualized , and their delineation bears all the im - press of truth .

		With the three translations from the French just passed in review , we may discuss three rather im - portant translations from the recent fiction of the Scandinavian North ; and it is something of a co - incidence that the first of the three to be taken up ,
Herr Pontoppidan	PERSON	's ''
Emanuel	PERSON	; or , Children of the Soil , '' should be like M. Rod 's novel in dealing with the experiences of a young and diffident pastor in a small provincial parish .


Herr Pontoppidan	PERSON	's '' Emanuel '' is the first part of a sort of novel - trilogy , in which the author has sought to exhibit the after-effects of the Grundtvigian movement that stirred Danish society to its foundations in the fifties and sixties .

		It is to be hoped that '' The Promised Land '' and '' The Day of Judgment , '' the two re - maining sections of the trilogy , will also soon be put into English .

		The movement which will always be known by the name of
Bishop Grundtvig	PERSON	was a religious revival and something more .

		It aimed to substitute a living Christianity for the dull formal - ism that had taken hold of the church in
Denmark	LOCATION	, and at the same time to awaken the historical con - sciousness of the Scandinavian people by reviving an interest in their magnificent inheritance of myth and tradition .

		It also aimed to exalt the peasant as the finest , because the least sophisticated , element of the Scandinavian character .

		We say Scandinavian rather than Danish of set purpose , because
Grundt	PERSON	- vig 's influence was felt throughout the three countries , and because he never ceased to urge their union .

		The novel now under discussion deals with the seventies , when
Grundtvig	PERSON	was no more , although his spirit was still abroad and pictures for us the life of a small peasant community hopelessly estranged from the
State Church	ORGANIZATION	, yet eager for spiritual guidance .

		The generous soul of the pastor soon brings him into sympathy with the aspirations of his people ; he marries a girl of peasant extraction , and breaks with his ecclesiastical superior .

		At the last moment , the intervention of
Bishop Monrad	PERSON	, who is wise enough to see and correctly interpret the signs of the times , persuades the hero to remain in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, leaving him free to work out his ideals under the protection of the organization .

		This hasty outline can give but an imperfect notion of what the reader will find to be a very genuine and charming book , fresh in its interest and valuable as a means of acquaintance with the intimate life of one of the most interesting of European peoples .

		One is a little puzzled to learn from the title-page of `` Camilla '' that the novel is translated `` from the Swedish and Danish of
Richert	PERSON	von Koch . ''

		A prefatory note explains the mystery , however , tell - ing us that the original is Swedish , but that the heroine , a Danish young woman on a visit to Stock - holm , speaks in her own tongue throughout the book .

		`` At first , '' says the author , '' I let her talk Swedish , but she was thereby changed into a wholly different person .

		Such mighty influence has language not only over thought , but also over the whole person - ality . ''

		The novel is a pretty sort of love-story , with a strong pietistic flavor which keeps it from being very good art .

		There are many pages of rather puerile religious discussion , and even the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	is taken seriously .

		The name of the translator is not given , but the initials
N. H. D.	PERSON	, affixed both to the preface and the occasional notes , warrant us in making a good guess .

		We are not informed in what language `` Vera Vorontzoff '' was originally written , but we assume it to have been the Swedish , since the translation is made by a lady of that nationality .

		The book is a straightforward intense narrative of the revolution - ary propaganda in
Russia	LOCATION	, sketching for us the sit - uation that is presented in far greater elaboration by Tourgue ` nieff 's '' Virgin Soil , '' and written with marked sympathy and sincerity of purpose .

		There can be little doubt that
Madame Kovalevsky	PERSON	put a good deal of her own life into these pages , with such marvellous skill has she interpreted the emo - tions and the high-strung aspirations of the young girl who is the heroine .

		In many ways this story of a fictitious heroine is the story of the famous mathematician 's own girlhood , as she embodied it in the wonderfully vivid autobiographical fragment published a year or two ago .

		We do not find here the art of the novelist so much as the frank self - revelation of the woman of genius who can not escape , nor wishes to , from the trammels of her sub - jectivity .

		We may smile at the ill-balanced enthu - siasm that impels the heroine of this tale to self - immolation in her chosen cause , but we can not escape the impression that this is one of the most genuine books ever written , or refrain from paying tribute to the high qualities of mind and heart that it reveals .

		Some of the pages , particularly those relating to the Emancipation , are worthy of Tour - gue ` nieff himself , which is about the highest praise that it is possible to bestow .

		In '' The Master Craftsman , '' Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has given us an unusually good story , one that sus - tains its interest to the last and leaves a pleasant impression upon the memory .

		Two young men , distantly related , and reared under entirely different circumstances , are the chief characters .

		One is a man of leisure and of the world , suddenly confronted with the problem of earning a living ; the other is a master boat-builder who plies his craft at Wap - ping where the Old Stairs were .

		The latter wants
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 to get into
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, while the former has no ambitions in that direction .

		To put the matter briefly , they agree to change places , each instruct - ing the other in the ways of the world which he desires to enter .

		So the man of society becomes a boat-builder , and the boat-builder learns how to conduct himself in polite circles , achieves his polit - ical ambitions , and becomes a power in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Incidentally , each of the men marries the woman whom nature seems to have destined for the other .

		The book has also a hidden treasure that comes to light just when it should , and a great deal of curi - ous information about Wapping and the older part of
London	LOCATION	generally .

		It has the breeziness , the wholesome quality , and the entertaining improb - ability of all Sir
Walter	PERSON	's work , and needs no better commendation .

		By '' A
First Fleet Family	ORGANIZATION	'' we are to understand a family included in the first shipment of convicts and their guard to
Botany Bay	LOCATION	in
New South Wales	LOCATION	.

		The authors of the book -LRB- for it is a collaborative work -RRB- have given us quite as much fact as fiction , and told perhaps for the first time in readable literary form the story of the famous penal settlement in its beginnings .

		The element of historical justification enters quite considerably into this book , which may , nevertheless , be read for entertainment alone with - out any great disappointment , although judged as a work of fiction pure and simple it has many short - comings .

		If we are not greatly mistaken , Mr.
S. R. Keight	PERSON	- ley is a new novelist who will have to be reckoned with .

		His two works , '' The Crimson Sign '' and '' The Cavaliers , '' are as good historical fiction as has been published in many a day , quite as good as the early books of Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	and Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	.

		Of course , they are the same sort of thing over again , just as ''
Micah Clarke	PERSON	'' and '' A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	'' were
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	over again , and equally of course , the man whose genius originates a style and a manner stands on a pedestal far above the heads of the men who merely imitate him .

		This reservation being made , we may give very high praise to Mr.
Keightley	PERSON	's novels . ''

		The Crimson Sign , '' which is the less finished and effective of the two , deals with the famous siege of
Londonderry	LOCATION	; '' The Cavaliers '' has for its subject the Civil War in
England	LOCATION	, the victories of
Cromwell	PERSON	, and the trials of the King at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Carisbrooke Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the latter book , as the title would indicate , our sym - pathies are enlisted in the royalist cause , although justice is not withheld from
Cromwell	LOCATION	in the strik - ing portrayal of his character that the tale affords .


E. Livingston Frescott	PERSON	is a new name to us , and appears at about the same time upon the title-pages of two novels .

		Both stories are of the most improb - able sort , so irresponsible in their dealings with human character that they hold the attention only by their appeal to curiosity .

		We wonder at every step what fantastic twist of invention will be the next to be displayed by the writer .

		In `` The Apotheosis of Mr.
Tyrawley	PERSON	'' we have for hero a card-sharper and chevalier d'industrie , who falls sentimentally in love with a schoolgirl , and deter - mines to lead '' a better life . ''

		He has a hard time of it , but comes out all right at last , and finds a benevolent old uncle added to the other rewards of virtue .

		In `` A Mask and a Martyr '' we have for hero a man who seems to be a coward , a drunkard , and a thief .

		After we have tried to become rec - onciled to the various forms of blackguardism to which he appears addicted , we find out to our amazement that he has only pretended to be a scoundrel , that his wife is a dipsomaniac , and that he has thus shaped appearances against his own character for the sole purpose of shielding her , and avoiding the exposure of her infirmity .

		Both of these books do violence to every principle of good novel-writing , and their ingenuity of invention does little to save them from condemnation .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	, after essaying several other varieties of fiction with more or less success , has made an experiment in the picaresque , choosing , however , to set his rascally hero in a nineteenth - century environment , instead of removing him to the comfortable distance of the seventeenth century .

		Piquancy is certainly lent to the story by the con - trast thus offered between the modern setting , on the one hand , and the old-fashioned sort of motive , intrigue , and literary manner , on the other .

		The story is told by a valet the '' Gentleman 's Gentle - man '' of the title and a precious rascal he makes his master out to be .

		True to the picaresque model , the tale has but slight unity as a whole , and relies for its interest upon the episodes that it loosely links together .

		u The Second Opportunity of Mr.
Staplehurst	PERSON	'' is a whimsical narrative of the sort that we associate with the writer who calls himself
F. Anstey	PERSON	.

		A successful man of letters , who has reached middle life , expresses the wish to begin his career over again , retaining the benefit of his already acquired expe - rience .

		Greatly to his surprise the wish is granted , and he finds his youth renewed , although he still remembers all about his former existence .

		But he uses his '' second opportunity '' only to make a mess of things , and ends by wishing himself back into his previous life .

		The story is extremely amusing , although the conception is worked out in a rather reckless way , and a good many tag-ends are left for the imagination of the reader to adjust . ''

		The X Jewel '' is an interesting romance , dis - appointing only because it is left in an unfinished state .

		This was doubtless intentional with the writer , but we really have a right to know more than he tells us of the mystery concerned , and to enjoy at greater length the reunion of the happy lovers .

		The story deals with the turbulent Scotch court during the early manhood of the son of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, and affords us the novelty of reading about
Elizabeth	PERSON	in the character of an '' old termagant . ''

		The delineation of James would be masterly if it did not clothe him as a boy with all the shrewdness and pedantry of his later years .

		It is impossible to 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, accept this sketch of the King in
1585	DATE	, although it would pass without question twenty or thirty years later .

		The tale is compactly told , and almost
Stev	PERSON	- ensonian in the finish of its best pages .

		The anonymous novel called '' A Stumhler in Wide Shoes '' deserves a better title .

		It is the very readable story of a young Dutch artist who marries an English girl , does not appreciate her simple devotion and strength of character , becomes en - tangled with a beautiful Jewess , gets into desperate financial straits , and in trying to extricate himself becomes a thief .

		His character is so utterly worth - less that we are hardly prepared for his final apoth - eosis .

		When he has realized the depth of his hu - miliation , he goes to
Paris	LOCATION	, starts a new life under an assumed name , becomes a great artist , and re - ceives forgiveness from bis injured wife .

		It is true that he was not only sinning , but sinned against as well , yet the rehabilitation of his character seems to be beyond the limits of the possible .

		The scene of the story is laid , for the most part , in
Amster	LOCATION	- dam , and one gets a vivid and faithful reproduction of the life of that interesting city .

		Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	is a novelist of grow - ing power , and the two books recently published by him exhibit a distinct advance over his earlier work .

		One of them , '' The
Sowers	PERSON	, '' is essentially a study of the Russian revolutionary propaganda in its phase of pacific philanthropical endeavor .

		There is an interesting plot , carefully constructed , a great deal of crisp and effective dialogue , and a fine ideal of human conduct .

		The characters are well differentiated , and each of the more im - portant figures is a study by itself .

		`` Flotsam '' shifts the scene from
Russia	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, and its inter - est centres about the Mutiny , although but one im - portant episode of that struggle the siege of
Delhi	LOCATION	is described at length .

		The leading character is a man in many ways prepossessing , but fatally weak , and led by his lack of will to the disaster that wrecks his life .

		It is evident that Mr.
Merriman	PERSON	has writ - ten neither of these books from hearsay , but has visited the countries concerned , and made faithful studies of the local coloring .

		The conscience thus displayed , together with a brilliant gift for charac - terization and dramatic effect , put his novels among the best of the season for entertainment , and , to no small extent , for instruction .

		Mrs.
Cotes	PERSON	, also , has an Indian story for us in `` His Honour , and a Lady . ''

		It deals with the social life of modern
India	LOCATION	, which the writer knows well , but displays , besides , no little insight into the native character .

		It can not be compared in this respect with the work of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	, but their example has made it henceforth impossible for a novelist of
India	LOCATION	to give us the merely conventionalized background of native life as we used to have it in Anglo-Indian fiction .

		Our eyes have been opened , and even so superficial a writer as Mrs.
Cotes	PERSON	is forced to furnish something better than the old pretence of characterization .

		The story is essentially that of an earnest and incor - ruptible , but unimaginative and philistine , English official , who tries to do his duty in his own stubborn way .

		We can not sympathize very much with the particular thing he tries to do , and which in the end leads to his overthrow and death , but we can heartily applaud the spirit in which he sets about what he conceives to be his duty .

		Mrs.
Cotes	PERSON	, like most other people who have lived for any length of time in
India	LOCATION	, understands very clearly how ill-advised is much of the meddlesome legislation for the Em - pire that emanates from Westminster , and how nec - essary it is that the colonial administrator should have a free hand in matters that do not affect for - eign relations .

		This phase of the subject receives sharp and effective satire at her hands .

		For the rest , her story is lively and agreeable , and of the sort that is as easily read as forgotten .

		In '' The Madonna of a Day '' we hardly recog - nize Miss DougalPs hand until we have got well into the book .

		It begins in so animated a fashion , and holds out such promise of real excitement , that the author seems to have taken a wholly new de - parture .

		The dull and heavy earnestness to which readers of her other books have become so accus - tomed appears after a while , but not before the story , as a mere piece of picturesque adventure , has acquired momentum sufficient to carry its interest on to the end .

		Miss
Dougall	PERSON	's work is always orig - inal , and the present story is peculiarly so .

		We are tempted to call it the best that she has yet written .

		Miss
Wilkins	PERSON	gives us in her new story some - thing more of passion and the play of the primitive instincts of humanity than she has been wont to deal with , and the result , it must be admitted , is art of a less finished and convincing sort than that to which her books have hitherto accustomed us .

		The figure of
Madelon	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who gives her name to the novel -RRB- is a little unreal and theatrical , and the other leading figures are even more difficult to live with as actual human beings .

		It is in its minor de - scriptions and delineations that the book is most successful , for it is in them that the writer is per - mitted to exhibit the delicacy of touch that has given her so distinguished a place in our fiction .

		The style of the book , in the non-dramatic portions , is admirable for restraint and poetic feeling , and in part compensates the reader for what he feels to be the defects of the novel in its vital aspect .

		Miss
Bell	ORGANIZATION	's third novel , `` The Under Side of Things , '' is an improvement on her second , but we should hesitate to describe it as better than her first .

		Viewed as a whole , it offers a pleasant picture of life in an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	country town , with glimpses of West Point and one or two army posts .

		The characters are agreeably diversified , and two of them Mrs.
Copeland	PERSON	and
Kate Vandevoort	PERSON	are triumphs of delineation .

		It is , however , in its care - ful working out of details that the book scores its chief success , and one has not read many pages be - fore he comes distinctly to understand that this is not a book to be skimmed over , that every line of it has been studied and will repay perusal .

		This
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL evidence of the artistic conscience is very gratifying in our age of hasty novel-writing , and special atten - tion should be called to it .

		There are many '' smart '' sayings in the book , but the mere cleverness which it might derive from them alone is overshadowed by the delicate and tender sentiment that informs the story throughout , and provides its chief charm .

		Once or twice , indeed , this sentiment comes dan - gerously near to being '' gush , '' and we fear lest the limit should be overstepped .

		But the good sense of the writer stands her in stead at these critical junctures , and the situation is saved .

		No one but a woman could possibly have written this book or any page of it ; the feminine touch is everywhere manifest , with its many pleasant implications , and , we must add , its inevitable limitations .

		One starts to read '' A Fool of Nature '' with some misgivings , for it was awarded the first prize in a newspaper competition , and the realization proves worse than the anticipation .

		If this story was the best of the hundreds entered , what must the others have been ?

		The pity of it is that Mr.
Haw	PERSON	- thorne , who , although a third-rate novelist , is capa - ble of far better work than this , should have so deliberately written down to the level of the intelli - gence that he surmised would be brought to bear upon the awarding of the prizes .

		From first to last the book is unreal and unconvincing , written in a sort of slapdash journalese , and without any other adornment than the '' smartness '' of self-conscious - ness and the glitter of a tinsel rhetoric .

		Chicago is the scene of ''
Jerry	PERSON	the Dreamer , '' and the story is from the pen of a new writer .

		It tells of a young man who leaves his home in central
Illinois	LOCATION	to seek his fortunes in the great city , of his trials and successes , and of the weakness of char - acter that proves nearly , if not quite , fatal to his ambition .

		The author leaves us in some perplexity as to the future of his hero , with the impression of having got him into a fix and not knowing how to get him out again .

		The book shows many marks of inexperience , but is made attractive by a certain freshness and genuineness of treatment , together with a direct simplicity that is distinctly engaging .

		The heroine is a very commonplace sort of girl , and may hardly be given the sympathy that the writer evidently expects for her .

		But the book is , on the whole , a promising first effort , and we shall hope to find its author 's name upon another title-page before very long .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		M. COFFEE 'S '' Le Pater , '' which made such a stir in
Paris	LOCATION	a few years ago , is admirably fitted for use as a French text , and we are glad to see that it has been edited for college use by Prof essor de
Sumichrast	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		But we can not commend the work done by this editor in abridging '' Les Misdrables '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- for similar uses .

		We must call all such work vandalism there is no other name for it .

		The ''
Perdue	PERSON	'' of Henry Greville '' -LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- , with notes by Professor
G. M. Harper	PERSON	, is a volume in the '' Romans Choisis '' series .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Clearly , one of the greatest economic !

		.

		questions of the day is that which involves the governmental control or supervision state or national , or both of the rail - roads of this country .

		The vast and recent growth of the material , and especially of the agricultural , interests of the
United States	LOCATION	makes the question ` of internal transportation one that vitally concerns a very large majority of the people , and an ade - quate solution of the problem a matter of the very first importance .

		The railroad problem of to-day is not the one that existed in the earlier history of our government .

		The conditions which then ex - isted did not require extensive internal communica - tions , nor was there much demand for assistance from the public or the government .

		A study of this vital question , in some of its essentially modern fea - tures , is presented by Professor
F. H. Dixon	PERSON	, in his treatise on `` State Railroad Control '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He chooses to give a history of this control as illus - trated in the experience of
Iowa	LOCATION	, because that state was the centre of the
Granger	PERSON	movement , the move - ment by which the questions of railroad manage - ment were most bitterly fought out and settled ; and also because
Iowa	LOCATION	's experience includes nearly every phase of the question of railroad control , and the
Iowa Commission	ORGANIZATION	has been one of the best managed and most successful in the country .

		While the law of
1888	DATE	gave the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	the right to prevent and punish extortion and unjust discrimination in the rates charged for transportation of passengers and freights on the railroads of
Iowa	LOCATION	, it had no jurisdiction over a large portion of the railroad busi - ness on account of its inter-state character .

		The author concludes that , '' For adequate control of the inter-state business , we must look to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; and the solution of this entire question of control must come through a combination of national and state control , and a judicious division of powers ... The state commission should have authority to inves - tigate local complaints of unjust discrimination , with the right to certify to the courts refusals to obey their orders ... To the national commission should be given full power of prescribing a general classifica - tion and a schedule of maximum rates for inter-state business .

		If such a schedule were enforced , and the rates made stable , there could be no inducement to discrimination and rate-cutting within a state , and the local rates could be left to the railroads . ''

		Pro- fessor
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	, who writes the introduction to this book , gives a graphic historical description of the relation of the Government to inland trans - portation , and among other things , says : `` The industry of transportation is fundamental in the industrial organization of a community .

		He who controls the means of communication has it in his power to arbitrarily make or destroy the business of any place or any person ; and it was because the public recognized this great power , which from its nature is dangerous when employed with a view to 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, the private interest of corporations , that appeal was made to government for protection . ''

		The publica - tion of this treatise is a real service to those who are seeking some honest and sufficient solution of the questions with which it ably deals .

		international It ; was seemingly a piece of good relations and fortune that the three essays and arbitration .

		addresses collected under the title ''
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and added to the series of volumes on `` Questions of the Day '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , should appear almost simultaneously with the pub - lication of the recent correspondence between
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary
Olney	PERSON	and Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	on the
Venezuela	LOCATION	boundary dispute and the problem of international arbitration .

		And yet , the attention of the American people is too closely fixed upon the opening skir - mishes of a momentous presidential battle to more than glance at the weighty utterances of even men like Mr.
David A. Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward J. Phelps	PERSON	, and Mr.
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, upon political questions which , though vitally important , have no light to throw on '' 16 to 1 . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, in the first paper , attempts to dissipate the prejudice in many American minds against the British method of building empire .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	discusses the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	in relation to the
Venezuela	LOCATION	difficulty .

		He finds even less justifi - cation for the intervention of the
United States	LOCATION	than Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	in his later correspondence appears to concede .

		He says : '' Till some man can stand forth and inform us how we are to be injured by the adjustment of that
Venezuela	LOCATION	boundary line , I shall venture respectfully to assert that it is a con - troversy we have no right to meddle with . ''

		The third paper is upon Arbitration in
International Disputes	ORGANIZATION	.

		After celebrating the praises of arbitra - tion , Mr.
Schurz	PERSON	acknowledges there may be ques - tions of national honor which can not be submitted to any tribunal , but he thinks that '' It is time for modern civilization to leave behind it those mediae - val notions according to which personal honor found its best protection in the duelling pistol , and national honor could be vindicated only by slaughter and de - vastation . ''

		He does not attempt to discuss the prac - tical questions concerning the wisest composition of an international court of arbitration .

		These , how - ever , need more attention just now than the princi - ple of arbitration itself , if the present negotiations are to be pushed to a successful conclusion .

		More Jewish literature .

		`` Studies in Judaism '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the collective title of a series of papers , by Professor
S. Schechter	PERSON	, Reader in Talmudic in the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, reprinted in a revised form from '' The Jewish Quarterly '' and '' The Jewish Chronicle . ''

		The essays , while possessing a certain generic unity , are rather diversified in theme a distinct unity of purpose being traceable only in the three opening ones , on Chassidim ,
Krochmal	PERSON	, and the Gaon , which were written with a view of bringing under the notice of the English public a type of men evolved by the Synagogue of the
Eastern Jews	ORGANIZATION	.

		That Synagogue is , the author observes , widely different from the more practical , and certainly more presentable , Synagogue of the West . ''

		Its places of worship have no claims to ' beauty of holiness , ' being in their outward appearance rather bare and bald , if not repulsive ; whilst those who frequent them are a noisy , excitable people , who actually dance on the ' Season of Rejoicing ' and cry bitterly on the ' Days of Mourning . '

		But among all these vagaries or perhaps because of them this Synagogue has had its moments of grace , when enthusiasm wedded to inspiration gave birth to such beautiful souls as
Baalshem	LOCATION	, such fine skeptics as
Krochmal	PERSON	, and such saintly scholars as
Elijah Wilna	PERSON	. ''

		Other notable essays are : '' A
Jewish Boswell	PERSON	, '' '' The Dogmas of Judaism , '' `` The History of Jewish Tradition , '' '' The Law and Recent Criticism , '' '' The Child in Jewish Literature , '' `` Woman in
Temple	ORGANIZATION	and
Syna	PERSON	- gogue , '' etc. .

		The papers are marked throughout by scholarship , and should fulfil the purpose of their more serious side to attract the attention of stu - dents to the neglected and potentially fruitful field of Jewish mysticism and Rabbinic theology .

		j ^ ish women Miss
Louise Mannheimer	PERSON	's scholarly in ancient and translation of
Nahida Remy	ORGANIZATION	's search - modem times .

		m g an -LRB- j at ti me8 eloquent study of '' The Jewish Woman '' -LRB-
C. J. Krehbiel & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cin	PERSON	- cinnati -RRB- merits the attention of those interested in the general theme a phase of which it discusses .

		The work represents an effort made by a thoughtful Christian woman to present a true , though broadly - treated , picture of the idiosyncrasies of the Jewish woman .

		The work is not , like most of its class , a polemic for or against , the author seeking mainly broad and essential truth of portraiture , and with - holding neither praise nor censure where either is due .

		As Dr.
Lazarus	PERSON	observes in his preface : '' Her judgment of Jewish woman is candid and without bias , and if her growing admiration finds its climax in contemplation of their virtues in the olden times , her keen criticism is aroused by the observation of their failings in our own period . ''

		We cordially echo Dr.
Lazarus	PERSON	's wish that Mme.
Remy	PERSON	's book '' will be largely read by Jewish women , '' who will not fail to find therein a high incentive to self - culture and elevation .

		The volume contains a por - trait of the author .

		Local rales in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Edwin Cannan	PERSON	's work on '' The History of Local Rates in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- consists of five lectures dealing with a phase of local taxation in
England	LOCATION	which is alike new and instructive .

		The author sub - mits a vast amount of historical data and dry detail .

		Yet , in the very first page of the book he admirably prepares us for the investigations which follow .

		He says : '' A great deal that is true is not worth know - ing .

		The most inveterate bore is often the most truthful of men .

		All history should , I think , have some practical aim .

		Some moral , some lesson or
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 guidance , should be afforded by it .

		Even if tbis is not true of all history , it is surely true with regard to economic history .

		It would be absurd to study a subject so dry , not to say so odious , as local rates , except with a view to practical aims .

		We do not study such subjects from a love of truth in the ab - stract ... but because there are practical contro - versies about them , and we hope that we may learn something which may be of assistance in these con - troversies . ''

		It is the purpose of this work to mass the facts explaining the origin and progress of the two great characteristics of the rating system which give rise to most complaint , namely , that rates are paid only in respect of certain kinds of property , and levied from the occupiers and not the owners of that property .

		The author has made extended research into the English statutes and the decisions bearing upon the questions with which he treats , and has added a deal of unique information upon a compar - atively obscure subject .

		Types and symbol * Professor
E. P. Evans	PERSON	has found in in Mediaeval `` Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical Architecture '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- the subject for a very interesting book , and a very amusing one too , despite the somewhat scholastic character of its title .

		It is an attempt -LRB- p. 16 -RRB- to indicate the origin and signification of the most prominent types and symbols in the curious and apocryphal natural his - tory of mediaeval Christianity , which comes to its most obvious presentation in ecclesiastical architec - ture .

		The standpoint of architecture was happily chosen , for we may see examples of animal sym - bolism in any mediaeval building we look at , either actually or in illustration ; whereas other manifes - tations of the tendency are , as a rule , to be observed only by the student .

		The subject is wide and often obscure , and Professor
Evans	PERSON	would not assert that he has said the last word upon it .

		The book , how - ever , has an immense amount of example and illus - tration which will be useful to the scholar , while it is a perfect mine of entertainment to the more cur - sory reader .

		We can not begin to give an idea of the variety of quaint interpretation and singular allegory to be found in the work .

		It is an extremely entertaining volume , besides being valuable , and will doubtless open to many entirely new sources of interest .

		Essays on the Sonnet and other things .

		If temperance in judgment , pliancy of style , and a knack of fresh and sympathetic presentation , are rea - sons enough for conferring success upon a volume of critical papers , they are not far to seek in Mr.
James Ashcroft Noble	PERSON	's '' The Sonnet in
England	LOCATION	, and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A re - perusal of this book in a well-made second edition , printed , presumably without change , from the edi - tion of
1892	DATE	, is a pleasure to which one can testify with no very great reservations as to major matters .

		The initial paper , one of the more noticeable of the reviews written hpropos of the appearance in
1880	DATE	of Mr.
Main	PERSON	's '' Treasury of English Sonnets , '' is still -LRB- where other commentators have lost themselves in questions of origins and devious rulings about form -RRB- sensible and suggestive , and , for the survey which it purports to be of the sonnet in this special field , unusually practical .

		On the subject of the sonnets of
Rossetti	PERSON	also , and of '' The Germ '' -LRB- the pre-Raphaelite magazine which is the subject of the second paper -RRB- , Mr.
Noble	PERSON	shows something more than the mere timeliness of periodical writing .

		Other numbers are on
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	's poetry ; a kind of defence of unlucky
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	; and a monograph of Hawker of Morwenstow , the pictur - esque poet-priest of
Cornwall	LOCATION	, who is himself enough to give a book a second edition .

		A record of '' To renew our fondness for the some literary motherland by thumbing over the pilgrimages .

		pageg Q f hep gtory \ ^ obviously enough , the motive of Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	's '' By
Oak	PERSON	and
Thorn	PERSON	: A Record of English Days '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		If the record is a good deal mixed with fic - tion , it is because '' the dwelling-places of great and beloved souls , '' for her , include both the actual and the imaginary , and '' Here stood , '' or '' Here might have stood '' is as potent as '' Here stands . ''

		A pil - grimage into
Devon	PERSON	, ' The Haunt of the Doones , '' '' The Land of
Arthur	PERSON	, '' Eastcheap for Falstaff 's sake , and Knutsford or
Cranford	LOCATION	for Mrs.
Gaskill	PERSON	's , among the journeyings undertaken , have something significant in their added and somewhat naive testi - mony to the power of
England	LOCATION	over certain phases of the American literary mind .

		The style , with its drollities of phrase , its allusions , quotations , rhythms , apostrophes , shows more than ever the results of eager reading .

		Perhaps the best paper is that on '' The BrontS Country , '' where subject and treatment and actual circumstance are most clearly in accord .

		Knowing trees by their leaves .

		Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	, in his '' Familiar Trees and their Leaves '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , explains the character - istic differences between the members of the great tree families in a way to be easily understood .

		The appreciative reader will soon find himself plucking branches from the wayside trees and identifying them by means of the fine illustrations and admir - able descriptions here presented .

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	classifies the trees according to the shapes and posi - tions of the leaves , as simple or compound , oppo - site or alternate , toothed or untoothed ; but adds also , for the benefit of the novice , descriptions of bark , fruit , contour of the tree , habits , and minor items .

		The book is a study of the trees from the view-point not only of science , but of beauty .

		The illustrations , over two hundred in number , are de - serving of special note ; they were drawn by the author from nature , and preserve wonderfully the grace and charm of the originals .

		The book is one to read , and then to keep at hand for continual reference .

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
A. E. H. Swaen	PERSON	has edited the best plays of Van - brugh for the '' Mermaid '' series -LRB- imported by Seribner -RRB- , giving us texts of `` The Relapse , '' `` The Provok 'd Wife , '' '' The Confederacy , '' and `` A Journey to
London	LOCATION	. ''

		The apparatus of the volume includes a bibliography , a gen - ealogical table , a biographical notice , and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's essay , copiously annotated .

		There is also a fine etched frontispiece from
Kneller	PERSON	's portrait .

		The editor 's opin - ion of
Vanbrugh	PERSON	is that , '' though less witty than Con - greve , he surpasses him in humor , '' and that '' as a man he decidedly takes the foremost place `` among the Restoration dramatists , '' for , besides being a clever writer , he was an eminent architect , possessed noble qualities , and led an active life . ''

		The classical instructors of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	have just issued another -LRB- the sixth -RRB- of those volumes of '' Studies '' which that austere censor , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, has recently used to point a rebuke to the levity of his countrymen .

		Professor
John Williams	PERSON	White repub - lishes his convincing argument that the Opisthodomus was a detached building , and not a part of the Parthenon temple .

		Professor
J. H. Wright	PERSON	discusses a Votive tablet to

Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts .

		Mr.
William N. Bates	PERSON	endeavors to fix the date of that Lycophron the Obscure whom '' every schoolboy knows '' to have been
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's pocket companion .

		Mr.

Mather	ORGANIZATION	writes in Latin on verbs compounded with jacio , and Mr.
George Edwin Howes	PERSON	presents a useful and interesting compilation and discussion of all the Homeric quotations in
Plato	LOCATION	and
Aristotle	LOCATION	.


David Baptie	PERSON	's small volume , '' Sketches of the Glee Composers '' -LRB- imported by Seribner -RRB- gives brief biog - raphies of the principal glee composers between the years
1735	DATE	and
1866	DATE	.

		In every case are given the number of each writer 's glees , an ample list of his best pieces , and a statement of the kinds of voices for which each is written , thus forming a useful handbook and guide for directors of glee clubs and choral societies .

		We have frequently had occasion to praise '' The University Series '' of handbooks for the use of
Exten	ORGANIZATION	- sion students .

		A thoroughly admirable book on ''
Shak	PERSON	- spere and His Predecessors '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- , by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	-
erick S. Boas	PERSON	, is the latest issue in this series , and our only complaint is that it attempts to do too much for a single volume .

		Of the 555 pages , all but 88 are de - voted to Shakespeare himself , and the introductory chapters on the mediaeval drama ,
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Kyd	PERSON	, Lyly ,
Peele	PERSON	, and
Greene	PERSON	, are necessarily out of perspective .

		Mr.
Boas	PERSON	has evidently worked through the whole mass of modern Shakespearian criticism , and his selection of material shows discriminating judgment and rare schol - arship .

		A better guide to the study of the dramatist has never been written .

		Professor
R. G. Moulton	PERSON	's big book on '' The Literary Study of the Bible '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made somewhat for - bidding by its pedantic analytical schemes and classifi - cation , yet will repay examination .

		Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	has a fine sense of the literary qualities of the scriptural writ - ings , and the special object of his work is to awaken this sense in its readers .

		He accepts the results of the '' higher criticism , '' although they do not enter very con - siderably into a work the chief purpose of which is lit - erary rather than historical analysis .

		He uses the text of the Revised Version , and treats the Apocrypha as an essential part of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henry S. Salt	PERSON	, socialist , vegetarian , anti-vivi - sectionist , and philosophical radical , has always been one of the stoutest champions of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's memory against the many attacks that have been directed against it on personal and critical grounds .

		He made the poet the subject of two monographs some years ago , and now adds a third to the list . ''


Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	, Poet and Pioneer '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the title of the new volume , which is not content with the apologetic attitude assumed by most of
Shelley	PERSON	's admirers , but is boldly aggressive , defending both the poet 's character and principles in the most positive way .

		The thing is perhaps a little over - done , but on the whole we think Mr.
Salt	PERSON	more nearly right than wrong , and commend his work as a brilliant and well-nigh convincing piece of special pleading .

		AN IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENT .

		Mr.
D. R. Cameron	PERSON	, for many years a mem - ber of the
Chicago Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	and for the past two years its President , has just retired from his office in connection with that body , and has made his final report the occa - sion for a number of suggestions concerning the future policy of the city schools .

		This re - port is a weighty document , the product of much reflection and experience , and is charac - terized throughout by good clear sense and a recognition of the leading principles for which public educators are everywhere contending .

		The suggestions made by Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	are so well stated , and follow so closely in the line of the best educational thought as far as that thought deals with the problem of the large city school system that we make no apology for bringing the essential contents of the report before a wider audience than can be secured for them by fragmentary publication in the daily newspapers of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The management of the public schools in a large municipality is a serious matter , calling for the best appliances and the most careful consideration .

		How large a concern it is in this particular instance may best be illustrated by a few figures taken from the statistics of the year that ended with last
June	DATE	.

		The enrollment of pupils for the year was 215,784 , the number of schools was 224 , and the total expenditure
$ 7,328,531	MONEY	.

		The two chief problems presented are the management of this enormous sum of money , and the direction of the educational forces brought to bear upon the training of this large army of youthful citizens .

		With these two problems Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	's report is chiefly concerned , and both are dealt with in a preeminently enlightened way .

		As to the first of these questions , the recom - mendation is thus stated : '' It is my belief that a competent man of affairs , with large executive powers , conversant with men and values , informed as to the mutual interest of all parties con - cerned in financial transactions of the board , inflexible in demanding and dispensing justice in all matters of reciprocal interests , if chosen to act in the capacity of , let me suggest , a business directory of all its business affairs , subject always to review of the board , at a lib - eral salary , would by the introduction of business meth - ods into the administration of our affairs so effect a sav - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ing in our expenditures as would compensate for his salary many times over , and bring about a more rational system of procedure in all our business relations . ''

		Such a statement almost carries conviction in its train .

		In the management of large concerns , public or private , all experience goes to show that the best results are obtained when exec - utive powers are concentrated and responsi - bilities enlarged .

		The business of a board of education that expends seven or eight millions annually can not be effectively and economically controlled by committees and < ^ cm-independ - ent departments .

		It demands the same sort of ability that is required of the president of a great banking or railway corporation .

		Such ability commands a high price , but it is to be found in the market , and its employment would be a real economy .

		It is , moreover , unfair to expect from the members of a board of educa - tion , whose services are entirely gratuitous , the sort of devotion that is needed for this work of business superintendence .

		Men who have oc - cupations of their own can not be expected to this extent to neglect their own interests , and many of the most capable members of the Chi - cago
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	have found them - selves forced to resign because they simply could not , in justice to themselves , meet the multifarious demands made upon them by their office , yet were too conscientious to be willing to neglect them .

		Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	's proposal offers a way out of this difficulty , and its adoption would make it possible to enlist the services of the best men in the community without exact - ing from them an unreasonable portion of their time and energy .

		On the subject of the strictly educational work of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	the report is equally out - spoken , and equally in line with the most com - petent educational thought .

		We read : `` Especially should the educational department be left free from non-professional interference and restric - tion , and the legal power of the appointment and removal of teachers in the largest measure consonant with the right of review by the board be cheerfully committed to the Superintendent of Schools and his assistants .

		It scarcely needs an argument to convince any member of this board that the outlook of these executive officers over the educational field , their knowledge of school affairs at home and abroad , their acquaintance with the trend and scope of educational thought , their familiar associations with questions pertaining to school manage - ment and discipline , their experience with school life , their trained judgment as to professional merit in teach - ing , their professional pride , all unite to justify the commission to their hands , unrestricted by individual members of the board , or by non-professional parties , the selection , appointment , assignment , and transfer of teachers , the removal of incompetents , and the promo - tion of teachers to fill vacancies occurring in the more important positions . ''

		This is admirably concise and logical ; what the writer calls his own '' solemn conviction '' on the subject is also the conviction of every serious educator in the country .

		There is no question , either in this proposition or in the preceding one relating to business manage - ment , of any abdication of authority on the part of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is sim - ply the question of a voluntary limitation of the action of that body to the larger aspects of the public school policy , leaving all the de - tails to the decision of competent executive agents .

		Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	refers in pointed terms to the action taken last
spring	DATE	by the
Chicago Council	ORGANIZATION	whereby the school appropriation for
1897	DATE	was made two millions short of what is obviously needed .

		On this subject he says : '' In view of the almost unprecedented growth of the population of the city and the corresponding increase of school membership , the reduction of financial resources beyond those of the last preceding year seems like a suicidal act , an act at least without the sanction or sug - gestion of an enlightened policy .

		The whole policy of a government is summed up in the requirement edu - cate or punish .

		To neglect the former is to render the latter obligatory .

		The wisdom of the one is set over against the folly of the other .

		To cheapen the one is to multiply the cost of the other by a large ratio .

		In the face of this fact , the board is unhappily urged , nay forced , to a most rigid line of economy and retrench - ment , whereby the possibility of financial embarrassment may be avoided .

		It is not a condition to be viewed with any feeling of complacency , that of a retrograde move - ment in the management of the schools because of the fact that the board is shorn of the legitimate and neces - sary means for carrying to a successful issue the legal requirements of its department . ''

		It is shown that during 1895-6 , for the first time in years , new schools were built fast enough to keep pace with the growth of the school pop - ulation .

		The reduction for the coming year means simply that building must stop alto - gether for a time , making it much harder than before to '' catch up '' when it is made possible again to go on with the work .

		One more recommendation of importance re - mains to be noticed .

		The success of the exper - imental vacation school carried on in
Chicago	LOCATION	this
summer	DATE	by private subscription has been so marked that a real educational need is indi - cated .

		Such schools should , of course , be very different in plan and method from those of the regular school year , and the slight experience already had with them shows how successful they might be made .

		Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	, at all events , has taken to heart the lesson of this
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL
summer	DATE	's experiment , for he urges the organ - ization of a large number of such vacation schools , and , at the same time , suggests that the regular school year should be shortened one month .

		If the latter suggestion were made by itself , its wisdom might be doubtful , but coupled as it is with the plan for vacation schools , it commends itself to the intelligence .

		There is no doubt that the
summer	DATE	climate of
Chicago	LOCATION	is too tropical for the year of forty weeks that has hitherto been maintained .

		A school term that runs from the beginning of
September	DATE	to the close of
June	DATE	is sure to en - counter some unendurably hot weather at both ends .

		During such weather almost nothing of value is accomplished , and it is extremely prob - able that a curtailment of the term would result in no real loss to the work of the year .

		For the value of that work is not to be decided by any rule of thumb , but results from a complex of forces in which the tone and vitality of teach - ers and students is probably the most impor - tant factor .

		This is particularly true in the higher grades of the work , while any loss that might be felt in the lower grades would be more than compensated by the attractive and wholesome training of the vacation schools , should both features of Mr.
Cameron	PERSON	's sugges - tion commend themselves to the wisdom of the authorities .

		All the suggestions made in his report are richly deserving of consideration , and it is a good omen for public education in
Chicago	LOCATION	that so ripe and thoughtful a docu - ment should have been presented to the atten - tion of the body in whose hands the interests of the schools are placed .

		CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH .

		Is conversation becoming with us a lost art , and the correct use of its medium a thing of the past ?

		This is a question calling for the serious considera - tion of educators of the young .

		Spelling and com - position receive attention perhaps out of proportion to their relative importance ; some of the methods of teaching the former as , for example , the sing - ing of the letters being very peculiar , and demand - ing an undue share of the pupil 's time .

		But neither in school nor at home are correct habits of speech inculcated .

		In no country in the world do the ed - ucated classes pay so little attention to correctness of accent , clearness of enunciation , and the observ - ance of grammatical rules , as in our own .

		Even in
New England	LOCATION	, where , during the first half of the century , taking the whole population together , per - haps the best English in the world was spoken , there has been a sad degeneration .

		The pulpit makes some pretence to the correct use of English , but even here colloquialisms are not rare .

		The writer recently heard a clergyman of some claims to culture and refinement , in the course of a sermon on the indwelling of the
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, exclaim with much fervor : '' Oh , my brethren , what a blessed world this would be if only we were all plumb full of God ! ''

		Another preacher whom he frequently hears is addicted to deploring , in his exhortations to spiritual-mindedness , a too great desire to `` keep up with the procession . ''

		The bar has long ago given up the attempt to furnish a model in the use of English .

		Not a few lawyers purposely make use of slang and faulty grammar in court , thinking thus more surely to hold the atten - tion of the jury .

		As has often been observed , Europeans pay more attention to their speech than we do , because in all leading European countries correct and refined utterance is an indispensable requisite for attaining good social position .

		Irish and Scotch barristers , seeking to make their mark at the English bar , take incredible pains to get rid of their native accent .

		Lord
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	succeeded so far in this endeavor that he said his Scotch origin was finally discover - able only through two or three words which were always more than he could master ; one of them was solicitor , which he always made soleeeitor .

		In
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, as well as in
England	LOCATION	, among the educated classes the child 's speech is watched as carefully as are his manners and morals .

		To the upper classes of society is assigned the care of their native tongue , and neglect in this matter is punished by loss of social consideration .

		A little experience abroad will make an American painfully conscious of his national defect .

		In the very act of introducing himself to a German as an Ameri - kaner , he will almost certainly slur the unaccented vowels , and , if he be from
New England	LOCATION	, fail to give due value to the letter r .

		It is then that he will begin to deplore the birthright of the modern Amer - ican , the liberty to talk in any way he pleases , and to produce a jargon of slovenly pronunciation and street slang , uttered with a harsh nasal twang .

		Let us beware of reaching the condition of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	of old , and of
Turkey	LOCATION	and parts of
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and other European countries of to-day , where the literary and the spoken languages are entirely distinct , and the uneducated man is obliged to study a book in his own tongue as he would a foreign language .

		Of course , the most assiduous attention to the rules of good talking will not produce conversation ; for , as the '' Poet at the Breakfast-table '' says : '' Good talk is not a matter of will at all ; it depends you know we are all half-materialists nowadays on a certain amount of active congestion of the brain , and that comes when it is ready , and not before . ''

		As in producing fire with tinder , flint , and steel , so in conversation , '' after hammering away with mere words , the spark of a happy expression takes somewhere among the mental combustibles , 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and then we have a pretty , wandering , scintillating play of eloquent thought that enlivens , if it does not kindle , all around it . ''

		And then we are told that the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the fact that a '' chance thought or expression strikes the nervous centre of consciousness , as the rowel of a spur stings the flank of a racer .

		Away through all the telegraphic radiations of the nervous cords flashes the intelligence that the brain is kindling , and must be fed with something or other , or burn to ashes .

		And all the great hydraulic engines pour in their scarlet blood a stream like burning rock - oil .

		You can ' t order these organic processes any more than a milliner can make a rose . ''

		Too great an effort to make conversation is dis - astrous to its spontaneity and charm .

		All have had experience of those men of esprit who , in the words of the '' Autocrat , '' '' have what may be called jerky minds .

		Their thoughts do not run in the natural order of sequence .

		They say bright things on all possible subjects , but their zigzags rack you to death .

		After a jolting half-hour with one of these jerky companions , talking with a dull friend affords great relief .

		It is like taking the cat in your lap after holding a squirrel . ''

		Equally wearisome is the man with whom con - versation is impossible because he talks always in monologue .

		Coleridge would pump his listeners full on the slightest provocation . ''

		Zounds !

		I was never so bethumped with words , '' exclaimed Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, in describing a dinner-party at which he was forced to listen to a long and learned ha - rangue from the
Highgate	LOCATION	sage , on Homer and the Samothracian mysteries and the Wolfian hypothesis .

		Theodore Hook , after enduring a three-hours dis - course from '' the rapt one with the god-like fore - head '' a monologue suggested by the sight of two soldiers sitting by the roadside exclaimed : '' Thank heaven !

		you did not see a regiment ,
Coleridge	PERSON	, for in that case you would never have stopped . ''

		The true master of the ready give-and-take of conversa - tion , as distinguished from monologue , is like Mr.
Bagehot	PERSON	's subtle reader in the essay on Gibbon : he pursues with a fine attention the most delicate and imperceptible ramifications of a topic , '' marks slight traits , notes changing manners , is minutely atten - tive to every prejudice and awake to every passion , watches syllables and waits on words , is alive to the light airs of nice association which float about every subject the motes in the bright sunbeam the delicate gradations of the passing shadows . ''

		A common trick of the man who would converse fluently is to guide the conversation into some path - way already many times trodden by him into one of those ruts or grooves into which , especially if he be a professor or lecturer or schoolmaster or clergy - man , his conversation is perpetually sliding .

		This is not a practice to be followed .

		We like rather to converse with such men as
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, who talked not for display , but because his mind was a
spring	DATE	bubbling over with ideas , and , as he said , he must speak or burst .

		He talked on any subject that was started , rarely starting anything of his own , and making it a rule to take as many half-minutes as he could get , but never to talk more than a half - minute without pausing , in order that others might have an opportunity to strike in .

		In this he was quite unlike the Frenchman who observed the con - trary principle , and caused an envious and impa - tient rival , watching for an opening , to murmur : '' S'il crache ou tousse , il est perdu ! ''

		In general company , the conversational style should be light and constantly passing from theme to theme .

		If , as Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	has said , solid con - versation be indulged in , '' people differ in opinion , and get into bad humor , or some of the company , who are not capable of such conversation , are left out , and feel themselves uneasy . ''

		For this reason Sir
Robert Walpole	PERSON	said he always talked gossip and scandal at his table , because in that none were too shallow-brained to join .

		Whatever be the theme of conversation , whether weighty or light , much depends , for its ready flow and entire success , on how much is taken '' for granted and how much is left unsaid .

		Conversationalists should beware of insisting on nothing but absolute truths rigidly stated in the form of propositions .

		Conversation , like the other fine arts , aims at the ideal , and must be allowed to state its truths with embellishment , with modification , or even with exaggeration .

		One man who persists in being literal can spoil the talk of a whole company of wits ; like the production of a well-trained orchestra , '' its fluent harmonies may be spoiled by the intrusion of a single harsh note . ''

		Bacon has a word to say on the mode of delivery in his '' Short Notes for Civil Conversation '' which may be of interest . ''

		In all kinds of speech , '' he says , '' either pleasant , grave , severe , or ordinary , it is convenient to speak leisurely , and rather drawl - ingly , than hastily : because hasty speech confounds the memory , and oftentimes , besides the unseemli - ness , drives the man either to stammering , a non-plus , or harping on that which should follow ; whereas a slow speech confirmeth the memory , addeth a conceit of wisdom to the hearers , besides a seemliness of speech and countenance .

		THE DIAL 109 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		DOGMATIC PHILOLOGY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		A specimen of false philology , even more remarkable than the one pointed out by a correspondent in your issue of
August 1	DATE	, appears in the following paragraph on p. 212 of the new '' Practical Rhetoric '' referred to in your correspondent 's communication : '' Pure sentences are grammatically accurate , and true to the genius of the English tongue ; that is , idiomatic -LRB- from a Greek word meaning one 's own -RRB- .

		To write in the idiom of a language is to employ its characteristic modes of expression .

		A man may use correct , hut not idiomatic , English ... So , by the English idiom , only transitive verbs can take a genu - ine passive .

		` He is gone ' -LRB- elegant French -RRB- ; ` He was now advanced within ten miles of the
Sambre	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- a translator 's ren - dering of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's elegant Latin -RRB- , are not regarded as idiom - atic by the best English writers .

		He has gone is the elegant English equivalent of i7 est parti . ''

		The author of the above evidently mistakes is gone , a genuine perfect active , for a present passive .

		But the most surprising thing is that he should regard is gone as a Gallicism , and hence unidiomatic .

		A glance into an Anglo-Saxon grammar , or comparison with similar forms in modern German , would have revealed that the perfect and pluperfect tenses of intransitive verbs are regularly formed with be , of transitive verbs with have .

		Has gone is therefore originally a blunder , now ratified by usage , just as hat gegangen would be a blunder in German .

		Compare the lines in `` Lycidas '' : '' And now the sun had stretched out all the hills , And now was dropt into the western hay . ''

		The tense is the same in both ; there is certainly no passive in sight .

		Other examples in the same poem are : '' Now thou art gone , and never must return . '' ''

		That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed . ''

		Under such instruction as the foregoing paragraph conveys , how would the student come to regard
Burke	PERSON	's famous passage , `` But the age of chivalry is gone , '' or many well remembered passages of the English Bible , such as '' Babylon is fallen , '' '' Think not that I am come , '' etc. ?

		In these days when Anglo-Saxon grammars are lying around in every English lecture-room , that a college teacher of English , of '' twenty years ' experience , '' should have escaped the contagion , is simply astounding .

		But our author 's dogma in no way invalidates the soundness of his doctrine in another paragraph : '' With writers who pretend to instruct others , but are them - selves destitute of the first great essential to success , clear vision of the subject taught , obscurity is inevitable . ''

		After reading in the Preface , '' An invaluable aid to such as desire to speak with propriety and elegance will be found in Lessons XXI .

		and XXII .

		on common mis - usages , '' one turns to these chapters with some degree of interest .

		Much that is useful and necessary to the young student is found there , along with much that tends to purism , rather than to purity , of speech .

		One is reminded at every turn of the stock of inhibited phrases that were going the rounds of the newspapers a few years ago .

		Thus , we read : '' Try should be followed by a verb in the infinitive : ' Try to exert yourself . '

		Avoid the colloquialisms , ' Try and do it , ' ` come and see me , ' imitations of classical usage . ''

		Having occasion , the other day , to read over
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Essay on Celtic Literature , '' I noted four examples of this construction , which was evidently good enough for him , one of the greatest of modern stylists : '' I have no pretension to do more than to try and awaken interest . '' ''

		But before we go on to try and verify , in our life and lit - erature , the alleged fact of this commingling , '' etc. . ''

		And now to try and trace these in the composite English genius . '' ''

		seeing our American brothers themselves have rather , like us , to try and moderate the flame of Anglo-Saxonism in their breasts . ''

		-LRB- See also the '' International Dictionary '' under and . -RRB-

		We are informed , further , that '' Adjectives follow verbs of existing , seeming , and feeling ; as , to feel bad , never badly , unless the reference is to a blind man beginning to depend on his fingers . ''

		Is one , then , always to feel bad , never badly , to feel poor always , never poorly , to look sick , never sickly , kind , and never kindly ?

		Who says that sickly , poorly , kindly , goodly , badly -LRB- in this use -RRB- , are not adjectives as well as lovely , friendly , daily , etc. ?

		But it is not a ques - tion of '' intuitive philology '' ; is it then a fact of lan - guage ?

		Here are a few examples , selected at random : '' I do not mean American coins , for those look less badly , the more they lose of their original ugliness . ''

		Lowell , Big - low Papers , Introduction .

		In `` The Foundations of Rhetoric , '' by Professor
A. S. Hill	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, '' I came in late , and I felt bad when I wrote this theme '' is corrected into '' I came in late , and I felt badly when I wrote this theme , '' with the remark : `` In this exam - ple , bad might , according to the rule just stated , seem to be the proper word .

		The reason for preferring badly is that bad is ambiguous , ' bad ' being used in two senses . ''

		The only sensible rule would seem to be , when you feel bad , say so ; and when you feel badly , say so , if you want to .

		Our Practical Rhetorician further says : '' In our midst , for in the midst of us , is severely criticised on the ground that we can not possess a midst ; the English possessive , in its modern use , being almost exclusively limited to the notion of property -LRB- usage approves ' a week 's pay ' -RRB- .

		Old English writers used in the midst . '

		1 ' 1 Possess a midst !

		Must we , then , give up '' in our be - half , '' '' for our sake , '' '' in our rear , '' etc. , because we do not possess a behalf , a sake , a rear ?

		The use of the possessive adjective in the sense of an objective geni - tive is not uncommon in any language .

		THE `` PASSIVE VOICE WITH OBJECT '' IN JAPANESE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It may interest those readers who followed the dis - cussion of '' The Passive Voice with an Object '' in your columns , to learn that this is a common construction in the Japanese language .

		Indeed , it may be said , with reference to the vernacular of this country , that from one point of view it has no passive , but from another point of view its passive is a real one .

		Professor
B. H. Chamberlain	PERSON	, late Professor of Japanese Literature in the
Imperial University of Japan	ORGANIZATION	, who has no superior , perhaps no equal , as an authority on the language and literature of this nation , says in his '' Handbook of Col - loquial Japanese '' : '' Properly speaking , the so-called passive is not a passive at all , but an active in disguise .

		Such a form as utareru , for instance , is etymologically itchi * an ' 2 erw 3 , as literally as possible , ` to get 3 being 2 beating 1 , ' i. e. , ' to get a beating , ' ' to get beaten , ' hence ` to be beaten . '

		... Intransitive verbs -LSB- also -RSB- are sus - ceptible of passive forms , such as furareru , ` to get rained upon , ' ' to have it rain , ' from furu , ' to rain . ' ''

		And yet , though in form the Japanese passive is '' an active in disguise , '' yet in meaning it seems to be a true passive , inasmuch as it represents the suffering or the receiving of an action .

		With reference to the use of an object with a passive verb in Japanese , let me quote one or two illustrations from the above - mentioned Handbook . ''

		Kubi wo hanerareta '' -LRB- in which '' wo '' is the accusative postposi - tion -RRB- means literally , '' Head got-struck-off , '' i. e. '' -LSB- He -RSB- got -LSB- his -RSB- head cut off , '' or loosely , '' -LSB- His -RSB- head was cut off . ''

		`` Ashi wo inu ni kuitsukaremashita '' means lit - erally , '' Leg dog by -LSB- I -RSB- have-got-bitten , '' i. e. , '' -LSB- I -RSB- have had -LSB- my -RSB- leg bitten by a dog , '' or , '' -LSB- I -RSB- have been bitten in the leg by a dog . ''

		The expression , `` A dog has bitten -LSB- my -RSB- leg , '' would be , '' Inu ga ashi wo kuitsukimashita . ''

		The examples quoted by ''
W. H. J.	PERSON	'' will take the same construction when translated into Japanese .

		For instance , '' He was asked a question '' becomes ''
Kare	PERSON	wa toi wo kakerareta '' / and '' I was taught to sing -LSB- sing - ing -RSB- '' becomes '' Watakushi wa shoka wo oshierareta . ''

		It will thus be seen that '' this logical and well - accredited form of speech , '' of using an accusative with a passive -LRB- transitive -RRB- verb , is perhaps even more com - mon in Japanese than in English .

		And this is not the only instance where the Japanese language is more log - ical than the English language .

		THE JOURNALISM OF PARTS OF SPEECH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Parts of speech are generally classed amongst small matters by those who fail to realize that they are no smaller to know than to be ignorant of , and that when small matters are pertinent at all , they are as large as the largest matters .

		The editor of '' The Bookman , '' in answer to the criticism that '' none but he could have written '' should be '' none but him '' etc. , says that but here would be explained , '' not as a preposition , but as an adverb , equivalent to ' only ' a common enough usage . ''

		As there is no such equivalence and no such usage , the conclusion is irresistible that the editor , though a college professor of Latin , not only can not tell the parts of speech in English , but does not even know the principle of their classification .

		There is an adverbial use of but in such cases as '' If I had but known '' ; and there is a vulgar colloquialism , not of but for only , but of only for but , as in `` I never sleep , only at night '' ; but neither of these cases is analagous to the phrase in question , to which the editor 's explanation does not apply .

		However , assuming that his explanation does apply , the inquiry obtrudes itself , What is the construction of he ?

		Being in the nominative case , it can not fill any of the functions of that case appropriate to the preceding words , and its force must be sought in connection with what follows in sense .

		Thus tested , he is found to be the subject of could have written , that verb being read twice , once with none ; and but is proved to be a conjunc - tion , a classification as common as is its prepositional use .

		An adverb , taking a case , becomes a preposition , and , taking a clause , becomes a conjunction ; but here takes a clause , and can be explained only as a conjunction : if it were an adverb , it could modify nothing , he not being subject to adverbial modification .

		The same blunder has been made by the editors of '' Latin Readings , '' published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		On prceter ille Papirius , they first called prceter an ad - verb .

		Criticism privately offered was resented , and their position defended by various citations ; but , in the second issue of the book , the note was changed to read '' adverb , used as conjunction . ''

		THE DIAL ill THE DISCOVERY AND NAMING or
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The apparent motive in the preparation and publication of Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's volume on '' The Continent of
America	LOCATION	'' is not difficult to dis - cover .

		Its author had an ambition to relate the story of the discovery and naming of
America	LOCATION	on more sumptuous folio pages , set off by a greater wealth of illustration , than any of his predecessors .

		This can not be called an un - worthy ambition ; and , so far as we are ac - quainted with competing works , it has been gratified .

		Indeed , in what we regard as its dis - tinguishing feature we do not know that the book has any real competitors .

		Some of the later historical writers have used a profusion of map reproductions and other illustrations with great advantage in their works ; but we recall nothing in its own sphere that can compete with the present work .

		In these respects , Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	bears off the palm .

		We by no means deny other merits to his book , but the word of praise that has now been spoken is the highest word that can be accorded it .

		The author first deals , in three short chap - ters , with the gradual growth of cosmography and the nomenclature of the old continents .

		The familiar information about the first topic is illustrated with admirable reproductions of the familiar maps , '' The World According to Homer , '' `` The World of HecataBus , '' etc. .

		Regarding the names of the continents , he has brought together an interesting collection of theories , with a view , apparently , of preparing the way for the congratulatory remark , that Americans not only know for whom their world is called , but the very day and hour of its bap - tismal ceremony .

		The vestibule passed , we find ourselves face to face with one of the two main theses of the book .

		This is , that
Watling Island	LOCATION	is the same island that the natives called Guanahani and
Columbus	LOCATION	renamed
San Salvador	LOCATION	; or , in other words , that it was the scene of the landfall of
October 12 , 1492	DATE	.

		From a modern point of view , it might seem strange that Guanahani * THE CONTINENT OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	: ITS DISCOVERY AND ITS BAPTISM .

		An Essay on the Nomenclature of the Old
Conti	PERSON	- nents .

		A
Bibliographical Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	into the Naming of

Americus Vespucius	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Boyd Thacher	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
William Evarts Benjamin	PERSON	.

		was ever lost sight of , or that its identity could become doubtful .

		Such , however , is the fact .

		The islands that contend for the honor of hav - ing been pressed by the Admiral 's foot on that memorable morning is not smaller than the number of cities that contended for Homer .

		But we should not look at the matter from a modern point of view .

		The discovery of Amer - ica was an accident , and many subsequent dis - coveries made in the course of laying it open to the world were also accidents .

		The discoverers were not self-conscious ; often they did not know what they were doing , either because they read what they saw in the light of preconceived ideas , or for some other reason .

		Columbus and
Cabot	PERSON	were both looking for Cathay ; their fol - lowers on the westward paths were frequently looking for what they did not find gold , or a passage to
Asia	LOCATION	, or a favorable seat for a plan - tation , or a native kingdom to conquer ; and why should it be thought strange that they sometimes disregarded , or did not plainly mark , what did not for the time being meet their expec - tations ?

		Then what havoc time has wrought with the literary memorials of that great period in history !

		To-day the scientific spirit is first in the mind of the scholar who seeks to follow those paths , but it was commonly last in the minds of those who discovered the paths .

		The two letters that he wrote to
Santangel	PERSON	and
Sanchez	PERSON	, as he neared
Spain	LOCATION	on his return voyage , are the only contemporary printed ac - counts , our author tells us , of what
Colum	PERSON	- bus had found in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately , they throw no light on the spot of the landfall .

		We know that the Admiral kept a journal of his voyage , and that it was in existence for many years after his death ; but it has long been numbered among the lost historical treas - ures of the world .

		He wrote to the Catholic Princes that , besides the journal , he should draw up a nautical chart , which would include the several parts of the ocean and land that he visited in their proper situations , and a book to represent the whole by pictures with latitudes and longitudes ; but if he executed these works , they also are lost .

		But , fortunately ,
Ferdinand Columbus	PERSON	, who had in his possession his father 's books and papers , wrote a biography of him -LRB- sometimes called the '' Historic '' -RRB- , and this book contains an account of the landfall and of the subsequent voyage to
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Again ,
Las Casas	LOCATION	, who knew
Columbus	LOCATION	personally , and who at one time had the Navigator 's manuscript journal in his possession , wrote an account of the first voyage , and this contains a still fuller 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, account of the landfall and connected transac - tions .

		Still , there are unpleasant questions hanging around these documents , or rather the first one : Ferdinand 's '' Historie '' was not pub - lished until
1571	DATE	, and
Las Casas	ORGANIZATION	's abridgment of the journal not until
1825	DATE	.

		How , then , shall the inquirer proceed in his effort to identify Guanahani ?

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	lays down three methods .

		One is to apply to the
Bahama Islands	LOCATION	the physical descriptions of Guanahani found in
Ferdinand Columbus	LOCATION	and
Las Casas	LOCATION	; another is to trace the course of the fleet backward from
Cuba	LOCATION	by means of the sailing memoranda found in the same works ; the third is to follow the history of the voyage from the Canaries to
Cuba	LOCATION	and note the distances sailed .

		The third method might seem to be the best one , but it fails completely . ''

		At whatever island in the
Bahama	LOCATION	group we attempt to land by this reckoning , we find his log has overrun it by many miles ''
Watling Island	LOCATION	by 317 miles .

		According to the method of his time ,
Columbus	LOCATION	estimated his distances , and , like most other estimators , fell into exag - geration .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	holds that both the first and second methods of identification point con - clusively to
Watling Island	LOCATION	; and , to give the reader an opportunity to judge of the argument for himself , he gives many pages of
Ferdi	LOCATION	- nando 's history and
Las Casas	ORGANIZATION	's abridgment of the journal , first the Spanish originals and then translations .

		Great names can be quoted in favor of other identifications ; but Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	errs , if he errs , with a majority of the best later authorities .

		To most readers ,
Guanahani	ORGANIZATION	is but a name .

		This short quotation will help to make it a reality , provided always the identification is correct . ''


Watling Island	LOCATION	has a political existence .

		Its pop - ulation of 673 souls unite with the 367 inhabitants of
Rum Cay	LOCATION	to form a constituency which sends one mem - ber to the
House of Assembly	ORGANIZATION	for the
Bahama Islands	LOCATION	.

		The seat of local government is in the island of
New Providence	LOCATION	.

		It is said that at one time the island was celebrated for its live stock , and in particular horses , cargoes of these being sent annually to
Jamaica	LOCATION	.

		The principal settlement in the island is
Cockburn Town	LOCATION	, at the point where we find the landfall .

		It has a sea ap - proach , with a good and easy anchorage .

		On
Dixon Hill	PERSON	, on the northeast end , is a lighthouse with the most pow - erful light in the
Bahamas	LOCATION	.

		It is situated in latitude 24 6 ' and in longitude 74 26 ' '' -LRB- p. 58 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	next takes up a question that is more difficult , and historically more impor - tant , than the identification of
Guanahani	LOCATION	.

		It is one of the vexed questions of early Ameri - can history , and starts up at once at mention of
Americus Vespucius	ORGANIZATION	.

		This navigator has been most unfortunate .

		No one who reads the later books for a moment accepts the old tra - dition , to the effect that Vespucius attempted to rob
Columbus	LOCATION	of the glory of discovering
America	LOCATION	; still , there is a Vespucian contro - versy , and a very strenuous one .

		The question is whether or not Vespucius first discovered the American continent .

		The competition does not lie between him and
Columbus	LOCATION	, but between him and
John Cabot	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	sets Cabot aside in the following summary fashion : '' If the voyage of
John Cabot	PERSON	, alleged to have been made in the
spring of 1497	DATE	, to what is now the coast of the
United States	LOCATION	was worthy of credence , the ten days between
May 10	DATE	, as given in the primitive text , and
May 20	DATE	, as in the Latin translation of the St.-Die * edi - tion , would be of the first importance in order to land our
Americus	LOCATION	on the continent of
America	LOCATION	in advance of the Genoese-Bristol sailor .


Henry Harrisse	PERSON	has so effectually disposed of the claims of the Cabots that no scholar to-day seriously contends for English priority in continental discoveries '' -LRB- p. 70 -RRB- .

		The old story is that
Cabot	PERSON	made his land -
fall	DATE	on
June 24 , 1497	DATE	.

		The 10th and
20th of May	DATE	are the days on which , according to dif - ferent texts , Vespucius sailed from
Cadiz	LOCATION	on the so-called Vespucian voyage of that year ; and when we reflect on the distance from
Cadiz	LOCATION	to the coast of Hondurus , we see the import - ance of the discrepancy in the dates .

		If Ves - pucius is to be brought to Hondurus before
the 24th of June	DATE	, the ten days will be found ex - tremely convenient .

		But Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	says that Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	has so discredited the Cabot voyage that no scholar now thinks of regard - ing it .

		Now what is the fact ?

		Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	's last word on the subject is found in his work entitled ''
John Cabot	PERSON	the Discoverer of
North America	LOCATION	, and Sebastian his Son '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1896	DATE	-RRB- .

		If the title of this work be not suffi - cient , then the first sentence of the preface will certainly answer the purpose : '' In the
year 1497	DATE	, a Venetian citizen called Giovanni Ca - boto , having obtained letters patent from Henry the Seventh the year previous for a voyage of discovery , crossed the
Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	, and , under the British flag , discovered the continent of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	subjects the
Cabot	PERSON	documents to the most searching criticism and corrects many things that he holds to be false in the
Cabot	LOCATION	tradition .

		He attacks both the moral and professional character of Sebas - tian Cabot with unsparing severity .

		He does not , however , attack
John Cabot	PERSON	, but rather accords to him , fully and without reservation , the honor of being the discoverer of
North 1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113
America	LOCATION	.

		He seeks to show that
Cabot	PERSON	made his landfall on the coast of Labrador , and not on
Cape Breton Island	LOCATION	.

		He contends that he made it earlier than
June 24	DATE	.

		Still , he holds expressly , not only that
Cabot	PERSON	discovered the continent , but that on his two voyages ,
1497	DATE	and
1498	DATE	, he sailed along its front from
Cape Chudley	LOCATION	in the North to
Florida	LOCATION	in the South -LRB- see the two maps , pp. 110-111 , 140-41 -RRB- .

		What shall we say , then ?

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	says that Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	has made it impossible for a scholar to take Cabot seriously .

		If this be so , then Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	has indeed discredited him - self , for he certainly takes Cabot seriously .

		It is therefore clear , either that Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	is ignorant of Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	's last work on the Ca - bots , or that he allows his zeal , to put it mildly , to outrun his judgment .

		Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	arranges in order the voyages to
America	LOCATION	previous to the publication of
Juan de La Cosa	ORGANIZATION	's famous map of
1500	DATE	.

		He puts at the head of his list , of course , the first and second voyages of
Columbus	LOCATION	,
1492	DATE	,
1493	DATE	; then comes the first so-called Vespucian voyage ,
1497	DATE	; next the two Cabot voyages ,
1497	DATE	,
1498	DATE	; then follow the third of
Columbus	LOCATION	,
1498	DATE	, and the second of Vespucius ,
1499	DATE	.

		He then makes the following claim for his hero : '' The first voyage of Vespucius began
May 10 , 1497	DATE	.

		The door of the continent was thus opened by the Flor - entine adventurer for the first time .

		On this voyage
Americus	LOCATION	landed on the
Bay of Honduras	LOCATION	, having passed to the south of
Cuba	LOCATION	, thus proving to himself and La Cosa , the pilot of
Columbus	LOCATION	on the first two voyages , that it was an island ; skirted the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, rounded
Florida	LOCATION	, and skirted the coast as far as
Cape Hatteras	LOCATION	in 36 of north latitude '' -LRB- p. 200 -RRB- .

		This is a controverted matter .

		The question is not merely whether Yespucius landed on the coast of Hondurus a few days before
Cabot	PERSON	landed on the coast of Labrador , but whether Vespucius visited the new world at all that year .

		The subject is involved in numerous difficulties , involving the genuineness , authenticity , and integrity of documents , and perhaps also the veracity of the explorer .

		The two foremost American writers who have recently dealt with the subject are Dr.
Justin Winsor	PERSON	and Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	does not allow the
Florentine	ORGANIZATION	's claim .

		He says it is '' at the best but an enforced method of clarifying the pub - lished texts concerning the voyages , in the hopes of finding something like consistency in their dates .

		Any commentator who undertakes to get at the truth must necessarily give him - self up to some sort of conjecture , not only as respects the varied inconsistencies of the nar - rative , but also as regards the manifold blun - ders of the printer of the little book which re - cords the voyages . ''

		And again he writes that it was in
1499	DATE	that Vespucius '' seemingly '' embarked for the first time to the new world , '' since it is likely that out of this expedition the alleged voyage of his in
1497	DATE	has been made to appear by some perversion of chro - nology '' -LRB- ''
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, '' pp. 337 , 341 , 373 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, on the other hand , con - tends stoutly for the genuineness of the voyage .

		He brings Vespucius to
Cape Hondurus	LOCATION	on
June 21	DATE	, and into the Bay on the 24th .

		Re - ferring to
Cabot	LOCATION	, he says that Vespucius prob - ably saw the continent two or three days before him . ''

		The question may have interest for readers fond of such trifles '' -LRB- '' The Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, '' Vol .

		II. , p. 87 , note -RRB- .

		The ques - tion is indeed a '' trifle '' in itself , but when writers occupy themselves with it they should try to be accurate .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	is inconsistent with himself , for he says , in another place -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 23 -RRB- : ''
John Cabot	PERSON	was probably the first commander since the days of the vik - ings to set foot upon the continent of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		Into the real merits of the case we can not enter .

		It will be for the specialists to say whether Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	has relieved a diffi - cult subject of any of its difficulties .

		He has certainly made a bad beginning in his misrep - resentation of the view of Mr.
Harrisse	PERSON	.

		The breadth of the author 's treatment can be readily shown .

		He has dealt '' with the life of Vespucius , with an account of his voyages , and an attempt to establish the landfall on the continent of
North America	LOCATION	'' ; '' the first voy - age of Vespucius , its published narration with the Italian , Latin , and English texts of the first part of the famous letter '' -LSB- to Lorenzo de Medici -RSB- ; '' the baptismal font of
America	LOCATION	, St. Die , the little town in the
Vosges	LOCATION	mountains where the new world was christened '' ; '' the * Cosmographiae Introductios , ' the book which conferred the name
America	LOCATION	, with a review of the four alleged editions printed at St. Die in
1507	DATE	. ''

		Then follow parts VII .

		and VIII. , '' Scientific Geography '' and the ''
Charto	PERSON	- graphy of the New World . ''

		It remains only to add that Mr.
Thacher	PERSON	's reproductions of documents and of maps , many of them in ^ ac simile , give a substantial value to his volume quite apart from the value of his conclusions as to
Watling Island	LOCATION	and the priority of the discovery of
North America	LOCATION	.

Sept. 1	DATE	, A SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER AND AMERICAN COLLEGE PRESIDENT .

		* Although Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's '' Life of
James McCosh	PERSON	'' is chiefly autobiographical , as its title-page announces , the editor has shown both taste and skill in the admirable manner in which he has arranged and woven together his material .

		He writes sympathetically , but his praise is never extravagant , and one lays down the book with regret that so charming a story is not longer .

		Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	's ancestors were farmers in southwestern
Scotland	LOCATION	, with the picturesque and rugged virtues made familiar to us in the writings of Barrie and
Maclaren	PERSON	.

		He was born near the river Doon , in
April , 1811	DATE	, and he thought that the wild mountain scenery , the romantic glens , lakes , and meadows of his na - tive place were responsible for his intense love of out-door life and nature .

		His picture of the Scotch people , given in the second chapter , is well drawn . ''

		Of all the people I have met with , the Scotch have the least of what we call ' manners ' in their intercourse with the members of their family , with their neighbors , and with the world generally .

		The
Scot	PERSON	loves his wife and family , and would make any sacrifice for them , but he seldom or never utters a word of compliment to them .

		He doubts the sincerity of such words and acts , and is apt to regard them as hypocrisy , having some selfish end in view , and speaks of them as Frenchified and unworthy of an honest Scotchman .

		I confess I have often been repelled by the cool manner in which Scotch people , after long absences or in critical emergencies , often meet with each other .

		I remember going up to a most excellent man to comfort him when he was trying to restrain his tears as he hung over the body of his son , just deceased .

		I was chilled when all that he could utter was , ' This is a fine day , sir . '

		We can thus ac - count for some of the oddities of
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	speaks of the high degree of intelligence among the common people of
Scot	PERSON	- land , and attributes it to the work and influ - ence of
John Knox	PERSON	. ''

		He insisted on having a school in every parish , an academy in every burgh town , and a university in every large city .

		In every school the
Bible	LOCATION	was taught ; in some districts it was the Book of Proverbs that was used as a text-book , and helped to give the people their shrewdness .

		This education did not and could not pro- duce the genius of
Burns	LOCATION	, of
Scott	LOCATION	, or
Carlyle	LOCATION	, but it came out in the massive sense by which they were distin - guished among literary people . ''

		He dwells upon the prevalence of the drinking habit at that time , to which even the minister was often addicted , and of immorality among young men and women ; remarking that `` it is * THE LIFE OF

		The boy himself seems not to have had any very strong and impelling motive in this direction .

		He says he did not care much for farming , nor for mixing drugs and visiting the sick , nor for the law , as he '' disliked wrang - ling . ''

		But he was always fond of books and of acquiring knowledge on all sorts of subjects , and he looked to the ministry as a means of gratifying these tastes . ''

		I felt all the while that if I was to be a minister , I must be pious .

		Often , therefore , did I dedicate myself to God , praying earnestly , but not regularly or sys - tematically . ''

		His father died when the boy was nine years old , and at thirteen he was sent to
Glasgow University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The five years spent there are chiefly remarkable because it was during this period that his taste for philosophy asserted itself and the ambition was formed to win fame in this field .

		He made few acquaint - ances at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, devoting himself exclusively to books , and reading with avidity everything that appeared from the pens of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		In his philosophical investigations he took up
Hume	PERSON	and
Combe	LOCATION	; and it is inter - esting to note that it was after perusing these authors that this lad , not yet sixteen years old , formed the plan of his life work . ''

		Thoughts on the Method of the
Divine Government	ORGANIZATION	were already floating in his mind , '' his biographer tells us .

		He was also making observations that were to be of great use to him in his future relations with students and colleges .

		Although the instruction at
Glasgow	LOCATION	was not above me - diocrity in some respects , a great many original written exercises were positively required from each student , and Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	was so impressed with the value of this literary training that he laid great stress on it years afterwards at
Bel	ORGANIZATION	- fast and
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		He learned another thing that was helpful to him in his relations with young men .

		During his five years at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, although he was an able and conscientious stu - dent , not one of the professors ever showed him any attention ; and his case was not unique .

		He felt that this isolated life of the young men was abnormal and dangerous , and at
Princeton	LOCATION	it was one of his chief aims to know personally all the students , and to have them all feel his interest in them .

		Says his biographer : '' The notion that a professor 's duty began and ended
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 with the instruction of his class-room was abhorrent to him .

		He thought it the most serious prohlem of the higher education to secure the oversight and unremit - ting care of students , without espionage or any injudi - cious interference with the liberty of the young men . ''

		The years from
1829	DATE	to
1834	DATE	were spent at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and we are told that the magnet which drew him thither was the teaching of Dr.
Thomas Chalmers	PERSON	, then professor of theol - ogy in the most famous of the Scotch universi - ties .

		Other attractions were the beautiful sur - roundings of the city , the numerous historic associations , and the fact that it was then the home of many eminent men , chief among them being the '' Great Unknown , '' as
Scott	PERSON	was called .

		`` I was never introduced to him , but I could get quite a near view of him when he occupied his place as
Clerk of the Court of Session	ORGANIZATION	.

		As be sat there he had at times little or nothing to do , and his countenance , though pleasant , was then somewhat heavy and dull .

		But the young barristers were proud to have a brief talk with him , and to hear a story from him .

		He was always willing to gratify them , and as he roused him - self his countenance was lighted up like the morning sky . ''

		There are also fine sketches of
Francis Jeffrey	PERSON	, ''
Christopher North	PERSON	, '' Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	, and others .

		Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	regarded
Chalmers	PERSON	as , upon the whole , the greatest man he ever met , and expressed the opinion that he exer - cised a greater influence for good on his coun - trymen than any minister since
John Knox	PERSON	. ''

		He made the old Calvinistic creed of
Scot	PERSON	- land look reasonable and philosophic , generous and loveable . ''

		The atmosphere of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	was literary and philosophical , and the young man had many advantages that
Glasgow	LOCATION	had not af - forded .

		The professors invited him to their homes , and on
Friday	DATE	evenings he had a stand - ing invitation to take tea with the great Chal - mers .

		His studies in philosophy were prose - cuted with renewed zeal , and he prepared '' the ribs of what , in after years , when clothed in flesh and blood , '' became his work on '' The Method of the Divine Government . ''

		The stu - dents had meetings , too , where they discussed all sorts of subjects . ''

		But , '' adds this always thoughtful and rigidly self-examining young man , '' some of us did not inquire into our spir - itual state before God as we should have done .

		Yet there were times when we did so . ''

		The experiences of the young minister in his first two pastoral charges are related with de - lightful freedom and simplicity , and a full ac - count is given of the great Disruption of the Church of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	was one of the organizers of the Free Church , and he re - garded this as the greatest event of his life .

		Perhaps his most distinguishing characteristic was an absolute devotion to truth .

		In its ser - vice he was utterly unselfish , and the straight - forward way in which he describes his labors in aid of the new movement is very impressive .

		During these exciting scenes he yet found time to pursue his favorite studies , and in
1850	DATE	appeared his long-dreamed-of '' Method of the
Divine Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' which attracted wide - spread attention , and procured for its author a call to the chair of Logic and Metaphysics in Queen 's College ,
Belfast	LOCATION	.

		He was loth , how - ever , to leave his ministerial office , which was agreeable to him , and in which he knew he was doing a good work ; but the opportunity to fol - low his natural bent , and to appeal to and im - press young men , was too tempting to be re - fused .

		His labors in the slums of
Belfast	LOCATION	, his active interest in the workingmen , his careful study of educational systems , and his outspoken sympathy with the North in our late war , show that his time outside of the class-room was fully occupied .

		Four chapters of the work are given to
Princeton	LOCATION	, where Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	took the Presi - dent 's chair in
1868	DATE	.

		It is inspiring to read the account of his life and work in this univer - sity .

		In conversation with
Princeton	LOCATION	men , one is always struck with the tone of veneration and real affection in which they speak of '' the Doctor , '' and after reading this book one does not wonder at it .

		It was a great work that he did , as president , author , teacher , leader in church discussions , and citizen , interested in all the things that make for the bettering of humanity .

		A very striking trait was his open - mindedness .

		He always turned his face to - ward the light , kept watch of the signs of the times , and was ready to take up his stakes and set them farther along .

		He had the courage of his convictions .

		He had the highest regard for
Augustine	PERSON	as a great thinker , but deplored his '' superstitions . ''

		He was unwilling to be classed as an Augustinian or a Calvinist , and freely criticised both
Calvin	PERSON	and
Jonathan Ed	PERSON	- wards .

		In his later life he favored a revision of the Westminster confession of faith , referring to some passages in it as '' knotty , crabbed , and hard to digest . ''

		There was a vein of senti - ment in his nature , and his sighs over a young man hardened in vice were those of a father , and tears of joy sprang unbidden to his eyes on the return of a prodigal .

		When the fight of the churches against Evolution was at its 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, height , Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	had the courage to defend the latter , and became a peacemaker by show - ing that it was not irreconcilable with
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		In
1888	DATE	, at the age of seventy-seven , he re - signed his Presidency , not because of physical or mental infirmities , or because he felt the responsibilities of his position burdensome , but because , says Professor
Sloane	PERSON	, '' he feared lest the infirmities of old age might gradually cloud his judgment , lest the advancement of Prince - ton might thus suffer a check , lest the dignity and influence of a long life might be impaired by feebleness at its close . ''

		He delivered nu - merous public addresses after that time , and during the last three years of his life jotted down the notes which form the basis of the present volume .

		He passed away
November 16 , 1894	DATE	.

		His was a life inwrought in the lives of many , '' like a fine gold thread in an endless tapestry . ''

		That it was singularly pure and noble and earnest , means that these qual - ities were sown by him wherever he went ; for he influenced others to an uncommon degree .

		It is wholesome to read such a biography as this , and it will undoubtedly have a large cir - culation on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The work is beautifully executed from a mechan - ical point of view , and the five pictures add greatly to its interest and attractiveness .

		The last of the portraits , taken at the age of eighty - one , is the best of them all , and one turns to it again and again as to the face of a venerated father and friend .

		CHILD-STUDY IN EDUCATIONAL , WORK .

		* Teaching is an art ; teachers are artists , and those who would enter the '' profession '' should recognize the necessity of special training for the work .

		The American public is slowly coming to see that education is not simply a formal process ; that a teacher needs something more than the capacity to read a text-book pre - scribed by an unscientific board , and to hear the children '' recite '' their lessons ; that the education of young children is one of the most important subjects that can occupy the public mind , that it should be in the hands of experts , and that it is worth paying for .

		THE CHILD AND CHILDHOOD IN FOLK - THOUGHT .

		By
Alexander Francis Chamberlain	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Ph.D. .


New York	LOCATION	: The
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		true that the ideal teacher , like the poet , is born , not made ; but it is equally true , as Mr.
C. D. Warner	PERSON	recently remarked , that industry , training , and the right method will do wonders in the education of a teacher . ''

		Under our present way of running the educational machine , tens of thousands of ' hands ' are employed , at low wages , who would be much more appropri - ately placed if they were tending spinning - jennies . ''

		Perhaps nothing in our modern life is hav - ing a stronger influence in turning the work of school education , particularly of the younger children , into the hands of experts , than the movement for child-study ; certainly nothing tends so directly to strengthen the esprit de corps among teachers , and to raise the profes - sion to a dignity like that enjoyed by law , med - icine , and theology .

		On the other hand , few '' movements '' are fraught with more serious immediate dangers from unscientific work .

		It is primarily to meet these dangers that Profes - sor Sully has written his '' Studies of Child - hood . ''

		He pleads in the preface that the book is not a complete treatise on child-psychology , but merely deals with certain aspects of chil - dren 's minds which happen to have come under his notice and to have had a special interest for him .

		He nevertheless proceeds in succes - sive chapters to cover systematically the entire field of child life , from the time of the earliest imaginings , through the dawn of reason and the age of questioning , until definite products of child-thought are reached thoughts of na - ture , of self , of God , of mind , matter , and mor - ality .

		Through it all , Professor Sully is calling attention repeatedly to our present inaccurate or incomplete notions of the child 's way of thinking of men and things its doll , the colors of things , number , etc. ; and of the difficulty of acquiring the desired knowledge .

		The author confesses that , in spite of some recently pub - lished highly hopeful forecasts of what child - psychology is going to do for us , he thinks we are a long way off from a perfectly scientific account of it .

		Our so-called theories of chil - dren 's mental activity have often been hasty generalizations from imperfect observation .

		The sentimental adoration of infant ways , amounting almost to baby-worship , is highly inimical to the carrying out of a perfectly cool and impartial process of scientific observation .

		Moreover , a child is very quick in spying whether he is observed , and as soon as he sus - pects that you are specially interested in his talk the chances are he will try to produce an
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 effect , and it becomes difficult to measure the result of the outside influence thus brought to bear on his mind .

		Similarly , it wants much fine judgment to say whether an infant is merely stumbling accidentally on an articulate sound , or is imitating you .

		Again , children are by no means so open to view as is often supposed .

		All kinds of shy reticences hamper them ; they feel unskilled in using our cum - brous language ; they soon find out that their thoughts are not as ours , but often make us laugh .

		For these and other similar reasons resulting from the nature of the observed , or of those who are in the best position to make observa - tions , the mothers , Professor Sully is in - clined to be somewhat pessimistic regarding the results of the study of child-psychology .

		A third of his book , however , is devoted to an effort at understanding the child 's method of expressing his thought with tongue and pencil ; and nearly a hundred pages of fine print are given to extracts from a diary in which some loving father has chronicled the doings and say - ings of his small boy , covering a period of six years , the boy being , according to Mr.
Sully	PERSON	, apparently a normal and satisfactory specimen of his class , healthy , good-natured , and given to that infantile way of relieving his animal spirits known as '' crowing . ''

		That there is good reason for hopefulness on the part of students of childhood is also shown by Professor Sully 's account of
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	's childhood , with which he closes the volume .

		If anyone is disposed still to doubt the im - portance of a scientific study of children , he need but glance at the table of contents of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's book on '' The Child and Child - hood in Folk-Thought . ''

		The work is a most scholarly treatise , the author having searched all literature , and gathered from every people the evidences of the child 's activity in primi - tive society , and the survival of that activity in the social institutions and culture-movements of to-day .

		His object is to treat of the child from a point of view hitherto entirely neglected , to exhibit what the world owes to childhood and to the motherhood and the fatherhood which it occasions , to indicate the position of the child in the march of civilization among the various races of men , and to estimate the influence which the child-idea and its accom - paniments have had upon sociology , mythology , religion , language ; for the touch of the child is upon them all , and the debt of humanity to the little children has not yet been told .

		They have figured in the world 's history and its folk - lore as '' magi '' and '' medicine-men , '' as priests and oracle-keepers , as physicians and healers , as teachers and judges , as saints , heroes , dis - coverers , and inventors , as musicians and poets , actors and laborers in many fields of human activity ; have been compared to the foolish and to the most wise , have been looked upon as fetiches and as gods , as the fit sacrifice to offended Heaven , and as the saviors and regen - erators of mankind -LRB- page 6 -RRB- .

		A chapter at once interesting and instructive is devoted to the child in each one of this curious medley of characters as member and builder of society , as judge , hero , and divinity ; the excellence of the matter presented being surpassed only by the manner in which the author has offered it for the use both of the advanced student and the general reader .

		The work closes with half a dozen chapters of proverbs from every tongue for the one , and a bibliography of over five hun - dred titles for the other ; not the least valuable feature of the book for either being the three indexes , which cover thirty pages .

		Child - study is certainly profitable and scientific if it leads to presenting a fund of information in such serviceable form .

		THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN .

		* It has been the ill-luck of women in the past to be credited with qualities that placed them on a plane apart : at one time , as by the early Church , they have been endowed with a sub - human wickedness ; at another , as by the age of Chivalry , they have been invested with a super - human virtue .

		St.
Chrysostom	PERSON	pronounced woman to be '' a necessary evil , a natural temp - tation , a desirable calamity , a domestic peril , a deadly fascination , and a painted ill . ''

		Chivalry arose , creating an ideal womanhood that stirred the imagination and the poetic fancy , and then raised it to a pinnacle where it was impossible for the actual woman to remain .

		Thus , both priest and knight did woman a great wrong .

		Whether as the '' painted ill '' of the Father 's imagination , or as the immaculate star of the romanticist , she was equally cut off from all chance of development .

		Whatever the faults of the present age , it is under no delusions with regard to the humanity * WOMEN IN ENGLISH LIFE , FROM MEDIEVAL TO MODERN TIMES .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, of woman .

		There are few trials , difficulties , or unpleasantnesses that she escapes on the score of sex .

		She is not considered incapable of bearing a part in the common life of the world on account of any ethereal qualities , nor is she held up before men 's eyes as a temptation to be made war upon .

		In the place of mere gallantry on the part of men , and coquetry on the part of women , there is now the simpler and healthier relation of comradeship .

		Except in the case of the sovereigns and a few heads of great families , English historians have given little attention to the place held by women as factors in the life of the nation .

		Accordingly the new book on '' Women in En - glish Life , '' by Miss
Georgiana Hill	PERSON	, covers an almost new field .

		In it are depicted the chief causes and consequences of changes in the status of women , prominence being given to domestic life , as embracing the larger number and as not having been summed up in the nu - merous accounts of noteworthy women .

		The position of women in
England	LOCATION	can not be regarded as an orderly evolution .

		It does not show unvarying progress from age to age .

		There have been breaks and gaps in the gen - eral advance , so that certain periods appear at a disadvantage in comparison with their pre - decessors .

		For example , in the old days of feudalism , it is evident that in the eye of the law women ranked on an equality with men .

		Narrow as was the view taken by legislators of their industrial life , and absurd as many of their enactments seem now , it was reserved for modern times to set up an artificial barrier be - tween the sexes , to push the working woman down a step , and rank her with children and '' young persons . ''

		The ancient guilds knew no distinctions of sex .

		They were formed in the interest of the trading community , for purposes of mutual help , and were as much for the ben - efit of the '' sisteren '' as the '' bretheren . ''

		The attitude of these early guilds toward women was essentially different from that of the mod - ern trade unions , and more liberal .

		In their ordinances relating to labor , everywhere the principle of equality is apparent .

		Not until later did the theory arise that women are com - petitors , not co-workers with men , and that it is better for women to be dependent upon their male relatives than to make their own way in the world a theory which still has its sup - porters , but is having much trouble to hold its own in the face of a surplus female population , and certain other insistent facts .

		Another curious variation in public senti - ment appears in regard to learning .

		In the
sixteenth century	DATE	, learning among women was held in high esteem ; in the eighteenth , it was counted something to be ashamed of ; in the nineteenth , it again finds favor .

		During En - gland 's great literary renaissance of the six - teenth century , women stand out prominently among the ranks of scholars .

		It was not thought unfeminine to speak good Latin , write correct Greek , or translate from the Hebrew .

		To be sure , they had the advantage of having their attention concentrated on a few subjects .

		There was less arithmetic and history and geography taught than is now imparted in the district schoolhouse .

		The curriculum of a lady of rank did not include many things that have now be - come matters of common knowledge among the children of the working-class .

		On the other hand , the education , if narrow according to modern ideas , was thorough ; without the stim - ulus of college life , competitive examinations , or the prospect of rewards and honors in the shape of degrees , the attainments of women in the sixteenth century , in the subjects to which they had access , were of a high order ; and their knowledge of the classics was more inti - mate and exact than that produced by the higher education of the present day .

		After the rigorous and healthy awakening in the time of the Tudors , a period of reaction set in .

		The seventeenth century combined all the faults of all the ages laxity of morals , indifference to high aims , together with relig - ious fanaticism and a lack of appreciation of knowledge and learning .

		By that time , Shake - speare was considered out of date and vulgar by an age of fops and elegantes who could read
Wycherley	PERSON	without blushing .


James I.	PERSON	, though a professed pedant , was adverse in every way to the progress of women .

		He treated them as inferiors , with ponderous levity , and nothing was further from his mind than the giving of any encouragement to the cultivation of learn - ing among the ladies of his court .

		One scholar , writing to the
Duchess of Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, speaks of authorship as an '' inferior employment , '' un - meet for the rank and qualities of a lady like her Grace .

		The Puritan movement served to retard the intellectual advance of women .

		Under the sway of Puritanism , women were taught that all na - ture 's gifts to mind or body were so many snares , and that true life consisted in crushing out all aims and desires not connected with the saving of the soul .

		A catch , a song , a dance , were looked upon as destructive of modesty , and only
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 fitted '' for them that live in the lusts of the world . ''

		It was little wonder that , with learn - ing at a discount , and accomplishments de - nounced as sinful , women became frivolous and narrow .

		The light-hearted , in rebellion against the austerities of their Puritan neighbors , plunged into excesses , and the more serious subsided into a round of domestic drudgery .

		Far back in the days of the Lancastrians may be traced the progenitors of the political woman .

		They did not shrink from '' memo - rials '' and `` petitions , '' even when these in - volved a good deal of publicity .

		Everything that concerned their families or the common - weal they felt to be within their '' sphere , '' and the idea that politics was the concern of one sex alone had no place in their minds .

		That complex creature known as `` the New Woman , '' to whom is ascribed , among other things , an unfeminine taste for politics , is not so modern after all .

		Arriving at a view of women in the
Victo	LOCATION	- rian Era , we are shown what English women have done and are doing as travellers and ex - plorers , in literature , art , trade , business , as factory hands , domestic servants , nurses , doc - tors , and in public and political life .

		Plainly , the Victorian age resembles the Elizabethan in being a time when the nation has cast its intel - lectual shell and become a new creature .

		Fam - ily and social life are affected as much as intel - lectual progress .

		The conception of woman 's place in society has undergone a process of re - making in this century .

		Domestic life has so changed that the old role of the wife as the home-keeper must be modified .

		To spend the best hours of the day in * what is called '' look - ing after the house '' is an anomaly in the pres - ent stage of civilization .

		In olden times , women had to superintend and take part in a dozen operations that are now performed in factories and workshops , and of which the modern house - wife sees only the results .

		Many women who are not compelled to earn a living prefer to assume some daily outside occupation that en - ables them to keep up a more luxurious home and releases them from the monotony of sewing and household work , and gives them also some definite purpose and interest .

		The many ex - cellent folk who tremble lest the world shall suffer from the adoption by women of modes of life unsanctioned by tradition may be consoled by the reflection that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is stronger than fashion or opinion , and will at once make her voice heard whenever the lightest of her laws is transgressed .

		RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY .

		* In reviewing the poetical product of a few weeks or months , it is often difficult to determine what name should be honored with the first place among those that call for mention .

		There are so many minor poets who write about as well as one another and all upon the same dead level of mediocrity that to prefer one of them to his fellows seems invidious .

		Happily , no such perplexity assails us upon the present occasion , for the greatest name among all those of poets now living stands upon our list , and must stand in the forefront of this sur - vey .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, work and the substance of his book .

		Unlike Ten - nyson , who in his supplementary idyl of ''
Balin	PERSON	and
Balan	PERSON	, '' used the text of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	in a merely sugges - tive way , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has kept close to his model , and in many passages gives us the words of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	with only the most trifling changes .

		For example , we read in the '' Morte Darthur '' : `` And
Balen	PERSON	smote him with such a might that it went through his shield , and perished the hawberke , and so pearced through his body and the horse croupe , and
Balin	PERSON	anone turned his horse fiersly , and drew out his sword , and wist not that he had slaine him , and then he saw him lye as a dead corps . ''

		In The Tale of Balen '' this becomes : `` But
Balen	PERSON	's spear through
Launceor	PERSON	's shield Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled , That horse with horseman stricken reeled , And as a storm-breached rock falls , fell .

		And
Balen	PERSON	turned his horse again And wist not yet his foe lay slain , And saw him dead that sought his bane And wrought and fared not well . ''

		In many passages , of course , the author gives him - self a freer hand than this , and paraphrase almost melts into original poetry .

		We quote once more : '' For in that place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ that
Joseph	PERSON	of Arimathy brought into this land ; and there himselfe lay in that rich bed . ''

		Transmuted into the gold of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's song , this becomes : '' For in that chamber 's wondrous shrine Was part of Christ 's own blood , the wine Shed of the true triumphal vine Whose growth bids earth 's deep darkness shine As heaven 's deep light through the air and sea ; That mystery toward our northern shore
Arimathean Joseph	PERSON	bore For healing of our sins of yore That grace even there might be . ''

		The poet becomes strictly himself only in a few stanzas introductory to the several sections of the work .

		He gives us in this way a new '' Song of Four Seasons , '' more beautiful , if that be possible , than the old .

		This is the stanza that sings of winter : '' In
winter	DATE	, when the year burns low As fire wherein no firebrands glow , And winds dishevel as they blow The lovely stormy wings of snow , The hearts of northern men burn bright With joy that mocks the joy of
spring	DATE	To hear all heaven 's keen clarions ring Music that bids the spirit sing And day give thanks for night . ''

		Enough has been quoted to illustrate the extraor - dinary beauty of this noble poem , as well as its tech - nical mastery of a difficult stanzaic form .

		A word should be said of the tragic atmosphere in which the work is bathed , of the solemn sense of impend - ing doom that deepens as we follow the fortunes of the fated knight , of the pity and chastened pathos of the tale .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has done no deeper work than this , and hardly any work more infused with sheer loveliness of conception and performance .

		It asserts once more his now indisputable title to the supreme place among living singers , not only of his own country , but of the whole world .

		There is a fine rhetoric albeit somewhat touched with hysteria in Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's Armenian sonnets , '' The Purple East '' ; whether there is in them poe - try of a high order is questionable .

		They are also very uneven ; '' The Turk in
Armenia	LOCATION	, '' for exam - ple , and ''
England	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	'' are of a far finer inspiration than most of the others .

		We quote the former of these two : '' What profits it , O
England	LOCATION	, to prevail In camp and mart and council , to bestrew With argosies thy oceans , and renew With tribute levied on each golden gale Thy treasuries , if thou canst hear the wail Of women martyred by the turbaned crew Whose tenderest mercy was the sword that slew , And left no hand to wield the purging flail ?

		We deemed of old thon held ` st a charge from Him Who watches girdled by this seraphim , To smite the wronger with thy destined rod .

		Wait ` st thou His sign ?

		Enough , the unanswered cry Of virgin souls for vengeance , and on high The gathering blackness of the frown of God ! ''

		.

		Of course , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's view of the whole Ar - menian situation is the product of emotion unbal - anced by calm consideration of the facts .

		A very noble poem , ''
Natura Naturans	PERSON	, '' and a dozen shorter pieces , make up the contents of
Roden Noel	ORGANIZATION	's posthumous volume .

		Among the minor poets of the recent period ,
Noel	PERSON	had a distinct place , and the quality of his utterance was individual , although his affinities with the Wordsworthian school were obvious enough .

		The friend who writes the intro - ductory note for this modest collection claims more than may reasonably be allowed for his poet in rank - ing him '' with the greatest of his contemporaries , '' yet his analysis of
Noel	PERSON	's delicate poetic endow - ment is sympathetic and helpful .

		In ''
Natura Naturans	PERSON	, '' he says with justice , '' we find a fine philosophical veneration for nature -LRB- so far removed from a mere sensuous appreciation of her beauty -RRB- fully exemplified .

		And we may note in passing bow the poet does not hesitate , in this poem , and in many others , to touch upon much that may seem ironical or cruel in nature , or even to explore the darker shadows of life . ''

		The passage which speaks of the maiden driven to suicide by despair may be quoted in illustration of the above dictum , as well as of the rich quality of the poet 's diction . ''

		` Mid gorgeous autumn gold she creeps to die ; All the deep forest burns with wondrous fires ; The low red sun glares like God 's angry eye , Through black contorted boughs , whose leafy lyres Are muttering veiled oracles on high , While she flits haggard through rain-sodden mires , Her heart a-flame ; wild-eyed and pale she fares ; The branches pluck at her the while she goes ; Few songsters warble where the hectic flares , But on a wine-dark bramble the wind blows Some soft gray down blood-reddened ; an owl scares Her hooting from the hollow oak ; she knows That place too well ; the lake is at her feet , Where she and he lay lapped in heaven 's bliss ! ''

		A calmer and perhaps a deeper mood of the poet is revealed in the following verses from '' Midnight '' :
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL '' Young Love , who leaps to life like
Rhine	LOCATION	, Child of the hills , reverberates morn , With laughter and with joy divine , Exulting only to be born , He crowned , abounding , feeds with corn The races , warms their hearts with wine , Yet the life that blest the lands Dies dwindled in ignoble sands . ''

		Noel 's technique is imperfect , as the editor admits and these lines witness ; but the subtlety of his thought atones in part for this defect , although not to the extent claimed .

		And it is a poor and disin - genuous apology to assert that '' sustained perfec - tion '' is '' more often the result of artifice than art . ''

		Those who require '' sustained perfection '' in poe - try do not mean the perfection of artifice , and are not to be deceived by it .

		The next book calling for notice upon our list is Mr.
C. W. Dalmon	PERSON	's '' Song Favours , '' and we must quote , for its very appositeness , the lines written in memory of
Roden Noel	PERSON	, and called '' The Flight of the White Bird . '' ''

		The golden bowl lies broken on the floor .

		The silver cord is loos 'd : earthbound no more , Our White Bird flies out seaward from the shore .

		`` Knew you the
Blessed Island	LOCATION	, fisherman ?

		Its cliffs are hung with harps ^ Eolian .

		Onr White Bird seeks it at the call of Pan . ''

		The silver cord is loos 'd if daylight fail ?

		Our White Bird needs no guiding mast or sail ; He knows the secret of the nightingale . ''

		His sad mates settle round the temple door To coo among the lilies on the floor .

		Our White Bird flies out seaward from the shore . ''

		This is , however , less characteristic of Mr.
Dal	PERSON	- mon 's work than such a song as ''
Parson Herrick	PERSON	's Muse , '' which ends thus : '' The landlord shall our parson be ; The tavern door our churchyard gate ; And we will fill the landlord 's till Before we fill the parson 's plate ! ''

		But here 's to
Parson Herrick	ORGANIZATION	's Muse !

		Drink to it , dear old comrades , please !

		And , prithee , for my tombstone choose A verse from his Hesperides . ''

		Graceful fancies , embodied in tripping measures , with here and there a serious note by way of vari - ety , are the gifts chiefly brought us by this pleasant little book .

		In the first of his songs , ''
Leviore Plectro	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Alfred Cochrane	PERSON	classes himself frankly among the minor poets , and expects that his '' pensive caroll - ings '' will , '' Unseen of any eye , Disport themselves in print and die , Like some midsummer butterfly , Without his gorgeous wings . ''

		This is really too modest ; for the writer , although undoubtedly a minor poet , is a deft weaver of vers de societ6 , and has little to fear from compari - son with his rivals in the field that he has chosen for his verses vain .

		Witness the close of his apos - trophe '' To My Lady '' -LRB- who has beaten him at croquet -RRB- : '' In cooler blood I sympathise With all New Woman 's aims , Her hansom cabs , and sailor ties , Her latch-key 's burning claims .

		But now I doubt if she be wise To vanquish us at games . ''

		Here are a couple of pretty stanzas from '' The Blackbird 's Song '' : '' What was it that the blackbird sang , Who whistled in the hedge A jovial note that rose and rang Along the spinney 's edge ? ''

		He sang that in a sheltered spot That morning he had seen A budding snowdrop , and a knot Of primrose breaking green . ''

		We commend '' The Golfer 's Dream '' -LRB- too long for quotation -RRB- to fanatics of the game .

		Mr.
Nimmo Christie	PERSON	is also a minor poet who does not pretend to be anything else , and this is his modest confession : '' The mad wind blows a little space , Then sinks into a breath and dies ; In meadows where its path we trace , And ` mid the corn , the poppies rise . ''

		A little space the sunbeam falls , And warms and brightens ere the
night	TIME	; And apples glow on orchard walls , And roses bloom where it was light .

		`` So , when we pass into the dark , And think to leave no record here , Some friend unknown , perchance , may mark The blank , and hold our memory dear Some one may hear with radiant face The song we sang a little space . ''

		Mr.
Christie	PERSON	's poems include a series of Scotch songs , some very acceptable sonnets , and a number of simple , smooth , and heartfelt lyrics .

		Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	is well-known to students of poetry as the author of several volumes , the most noteworthy of which is a collection of re - markably powerful sonnets , a collection unsurpassed for poetic energy by any American writer .

		He now appears as a singer of strong-voiced '' Odes , '' the best passages of which challenge comparison with the great writers , now with
Lowell	PERSON	, now with
Keats	PERSON	. ''

		What fervent and funereal pipes are set To shape one ditty from the shifting air ?

		What notes of wild reluctance , what regret Sobs through the tree - trunks bare ? ''

		This opening of the '' Dirge for
Summer	DATE	'' will jus - tify our mention of
Keats	PERSON	, and the reference to
Lowell	LOCATION	derives even ampler warrant from the ode '' To
America	LOCATION	, '' in which we find such verse as this : '' Thou art the peer of
Greece	LOCATION	in those proud stories Where battles bear out dreams ; For twice , idea-urged , hast thou arisen , Not moved by passion or a prince 's halter , And burst her bonds who half-time sits in prison , And poured thy best lives out on Freedom 's altar : And where Fate called thee thou hast spurned fatigues , So ever on thy marches ' westward border Ban a thin line of blood four hundred leagues , Chaos before behind a world of order : Dispatched such deeds : And now for what comes next Thou waitest in thine invulnerable West , Blazoning more large thy living-lettered text , ' Chance and the tools to those who use them best . ' ''

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, We must make one more extract a section of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's superb '' Ode of the Vision . '' ''

		Ah see , the moon from yonder hill swings clear , With mellow lamp searching her crystal sphere ; But in our realm below Her ineffectual torches dimly go ; Landmarks effaced , all things habitual , lose Their surety of use ; The world grows foreign and all out of doors ; Masked revellers bear abroad the Bacchic laws : Not in this moon tide jungle can the Soul Keep its clear purposed paths to ends foreknown , Shadows o'ertake it and upon it roll Reiterate gales from magic gardens blown ; Tired sentinel , its fires grow dim , White arms are near , frank eyes dissolving swim , And the wine-cups o'erbrim . ''

		We should like also to quote from the '' Idola The - atri , '' and the elegy on Poe ; but space does not permit .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, it must be confessed , is an uneven poet , and some of his pages are both turgid and obscure .

		But he has at his best the large utter - ance , the vision. , and the power of harmonious ex - pression that characterize poetry of the higher class ; and our literature has cause to be proud of such work as may be found in this volume .

		A long silence has been broken by the publica - tion of '' Joaquin ''
Miller	PERSON	's '' Songs of the Soul , '' a volume which contains three long poems , and four short ones .

		They will not add noticeably to Mr.
Miller	PERSON	's reputation , for his imagination , although it seems to have lost little of its glow , is as ill-regulated as ever , and all that he says now he seems to have said before in similar and better terms .

		Let us copy a stanza from '' Mother
Egypt	LOCATION	'' : '' Dark-browed , she broods with weary lids Beside her Sphynx and Pyramids , With low and never-lifted head .

		If she be dead , respect the dead ; If she be weeping , let her weep ; If she be sleeping , let her sleep ; For lo , this woman named the stars !

		She suckled at her tawny dugs Your Moses while yon reeked in wars And prowled your woods , nude , painted thugs . ''

		After a while , we learn that the poem is a plea for
England	LOCATION	to evacuate
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Now this stanza illus - trates , as well as a hundred would , the strength and weakness of Mr.
Miller	PERSON	's genius .

		In the first place , it is diffuse ; a truer poet would somehow have put the thought of the first six verses into two or three .

		All at once we are startled by the fine seventh verse , which almost any poet might be proud to own .

		Then comes the bald diction of the three fol - lowing verses , and the unspeakable incongruity of the closing epithet .

		There is hardly a page of all Mr.
Miller	PERSON	's verse that would not thus exemplify his uncertainty of aim , his nebulosity of expression , his ill-chosen language , his monotony of rhythmical movement ; and , with all these defects , his occa - sional flashes of the higher sort of poetic vision .

		What a pity that he could not have imparted the vision alone , with the other things pruned away !

		Two more volumes of the pretty '' Oaten Stop '' series of booklets have just been published .

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's '' Undertones '' reproduces the sensuous mood of his earlier volumes , their romantic feeling , their passion , and their tinge of melancholy .

		There is a fine large utterance in such a stanza as this from '' The Wind of Spring '' : '' The wind has summoned , and I go , To con God 's meaning in each line The flowers write , and , walking slow , God 's purpose , of which song is sign , The wind 's great , gusty hand in mine . '' ''

		Gusty hand '' is forced , and typical of the lack of finish that so often disappoints us in Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's work .

		The restraint so needed by him seems to have been cultivated to some purpose in this newest collection .

		Miss
Kimball	PERSON	's '' Soul and Sense '' is simpler and less sensuous verse than Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's , with an added touch of the spirit , and a note of mysticism . ''

		Contrast '' illustrates the gift as well as the limitations of this writer . ''

		Rout and defeat on every hand , On every hand defeat and rout ; Yet through the rent clouds ' hurrying rack The stars look out . ''

		Decay supreme from west to east , From south to north supreme decay ; Yet still the withered fields and hills Grow green with
May	DATE	. ''

		In clod and man unending strife , Unending strife in man and clod ; Yet burning in the heart of man The fire of God . ''

		Mention of '' An Oaten Pipe '' may fitly follow our comment upon the '' Oaten Stop '' volumes .

		Mr.
James B. Kenyon	PERSON	, the author , has mastered many of the simpler forms of verse , and his work is infused with genuine feeling and a true instinct for the beautiful in nature and life .

		Most of his pieces skim the surface of emotion in their rather airy flight , but of a few of them something more than this may justly be said .

		The '' Sappho '' sonnet is a favorable example of his best wor-k . ''

		Where is that bay-crowned head supreme in song ?

		The tides that darkle round the Leucadian steep Lap her forever into deeper sleep ; About her heart of fire the cool waves long Like cerements have been wound , and voices strong Of winds and waters o'er her pillow keep Their boisterous lullaby .

		That frenzied leap From the hoar height , when sense of sharpest wrong Ran in her blood like flame the fears that strove Within her stormy soul the lyric tongue Whose last high music rang through realms of love , Till hushed by that sea-weird which o'er her flung Its sudden doom , ah , all the dole thereof No equal tears have wept , no lips have sung . ''

		Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	's verse is always pleasing and in good taste , but we may hardly call it strong .

		The prayer of one of
Edward Rowland Sill	ORGANIZATION	's most subjective and striking poems , '' Lord , be merciful to me , a fool , '' has been taken by Miss
Geraldine Meyrick	PERSON	for the text of the slender sheaf of verses that she has entitled ' < Songs of a Fool . ''

		One of them , '' Dawn , '' may be quoted :
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 '' It will not last alway .

		A change will come ; This weary soul will fall asleep one night , These stamm ` ring lips will some short while be dumb , Then wake to utter truth ; a holy light Will brighten these dull , foolish eyes of mine , And I shall stand erect , a soul divine . ''

		A soul divine !

		A feeble Fool no more , But one of God 's own angels .

		Ah , that day Is long in coming ; distant is the shore I long so much to reach , and hard the way I needs must travel ; yet I will not fear ; A Fool , I know but this , that God is near . ''

		There are only a few pieces in this thin pamphlet , but they deserve attention for their depth of feeling and their sincerity .

		There are scarcely more than a dozen numbers in Miss
Plummer	PERSON	's volume of '' Verses , '' but they are compact with thought , and will outweigh many a more bulky and pretentious collection .

		They are inspired by no facile muse , and strenuous effort is impressed upon every page .

		They make their appeal to the intellect primarily , and their plum - met sinks into the deeper recesses of the soul .

		The irregular sonnet on `` Old Age '' is perhaps the finest of these pieces , and , like the verses of
Miss Meyrick	LOCATION	, suggests the work of
Sill	ORGANIZATION	at its gravest and best .

		`` Now is he come unto that countryside Past the last outpost .

		Here Life loosely reigns , Asking no tribute from the deadened plains Where stealthy mists creep from the rising tides .

		If there be fellow-travelers in this vast , Scarcely he knoweth .

		Voices that he hears Sound far away and strange unto his ears , Commingled with the echoes from the past .

		He hath outstripped the mirage of his prime Long since ; and journeying on to dip his hand Into Truth 's fountain , he hath come to know Truth for the chiefest mirage .

		On the sand Lappeth the river at the bounds of
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		His dull ear listens ; must it , then , be so ? ''

		The audience found by verse like this is naturally a small one , but it is well worth speaking to .

		The lilt of the minor lyrist pleases for the moment and is forgotten ; while the more serious note of such a poem as we have just quoted , if it succeeds in reaching the consciousness at all , sets up vibra - tions that are not for the moment only , but of last - ing intensity .

		Mr.
Robert H. Vickers	PERSON	has taken advantage of our newly-aroused interest in Cuban and Spanish American affairs to write '' America Liberata , '' a poem which we may describe as the epic of free - dom in the Latin countries of the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The whole history of the South and Central American republics is summarized in this production , with the chief stress laid upon the various wars of independ - ence that have been waged against Spanish mis - rule .

		Mr.
Vickers	PERSON	is a good hater as far as Span - iards are concerned , and his hatred , far from being mere vaporing , is based upon a remarkably minute knowledge of Spanish American history .

		A speci - men stanza will illustrate the form of this poem . ''

		Caracas ' sons soon hear the longed-for sound And deck her streets with banners as they wait ; Strew verdant palms along the holy ground And cheer her favored son before her gate ; While white-robed maidens , all of spotless fame , Drag the triumphal car where smiles in state The Liberator ; high and potent name That yields a lordly rank his merit could not claim . ''

		Bolivar is the hero of this stanza , and one of the chief heroes of the poem .

		While Mr.
Vickers	PERSON	is not exactly inspired in his verse , he is interesting , and his enthusiasm carries the reader well along with him .

		There is a certain solidity and seriousness about the work that place it in agreeable contrast with the metrical confectionery most in fashion at present . ''

		The Lamp of Gold '' is a sort of spiritual auto - biography , cast in the form of fourteen-line poems , seven groups of seven poems each .

		The confession is full of tenderness , resignation , and religious sen - timent , falling upon the ear in simple and pleasing measures , and affording a personal revelation that seems at times almost too intimate for the printed page .

		We quote one of the more objective of these sonnets : '' How sweet the shadows are that softly close Upon the shining boundaries of the world Against the gonfalons of gold and rose Through all the sky so wondrously unfurled !

		How fair and free the countless banners float , Borne onward in their royal pageantry , Till every hill and plain , howe'er remote , Thrills back the sense of some new harmony !

		And when the glory fades amid the hush That deepens downward with the deepening mist , The dreams of men take on the
morning	TIME	flush That shimmers through the evening amethyst .

		Only the blessed child may enter in The kingdoms where the heavenly powers begin . ''

		The aim of Miss
Sophie Jewett	PERSON	, in '' The Pilgrim and Other Poems , '' has been to attempt only simple tasks , but to perform them perfectly .

		The rare dis - tinction of style that is found in the opening poem does not desert her pages as they follow one an - other , and there is almost nothing in the entire book at which the most searching criticism may cavil .

		The author relies for her effect upon no rhetorical devices , but upon her absolute sincerity , and her well-nigh faultless instinct for the right phrase and the appropriate rhythm .

		If such a sonnet as '' The Soldier , '' for example , does not deserve a high place in American poetry , then our whole theory of the poetic art is wrong .

		u The soldier fought his battle silently .

		Not his the strife that stays for set of sun ; It seemed this warfare never might be done ; Through glaring day and blinding night fought he .

		There came no hand to help , no eye to see ; No herald 's voice proclaimed the fight begun ; No trumpet , when the better field was won , Sounded abroad the soldier 's victory .

		As if the struggle had been light , he went ,
Gladly	LOCATION	, life 's common road a little space ; Nor any knew how his heart 's blood was spent ; Yet there were some who after testified They saw a glory grow upon his face ; And all men praised the soldier when he died . ''

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's verse , `` Non vi si pensa quanto sangue costa , '' is the fitting motto attached to this grave and perfect poem , which is worthy of the text .

		Dar - ing the course of this article we have twice had oc - casion to refer to the work of
E. R. Sill	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again that thoughtful and harmonious singer is suggested by this sonnet , which also recalls Arnold in his most elevated ethical mood .

		A dozen extracts taken at random from this volume would not weaken but strengthen the impression made by this piece .

		One more may be given here , a nature-picture in which every word is effective .

		`` The lichen rustles against my cheek , But the heart of the rock is still ; With chattering voice the cedars speak , Crouched gray on the barren hill . ''

		A land-wind snarls on the cliff 's sheer edge ; Below , the smitten sea Comes fawning over a sunken ledge And cowers whimperingly . ''

		In the sultry wood lies a restless hush , Not a twitter falls from the sky ; Hidden are swallow , sparrow , and thrush , And the sea-birds only cry . ''

		A correction of the last line , making it read '' And only the sea-birds cry , '' would leave this poem with - out a defect .

		As it is , both these verses and many of their fellows need but to be read to be taken at once to the heart .

		Their delicate spirituality is a thing to be deeply grateful for , and Miss
Jewett	PERSON	need have no fear that they will fall unheeded by the wayside . ''

		The Road to Castaly , '' if we follow it in Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	's footsteps , leads through many charm - ing woodland and mountain haunts , and the spirit pauses to take refreshment by the way from many a deep pool of emotion .

		A love of nature , and a share of the fancy that informs natural objects with the life that we feel to be our own , are predominant notes in this volume .

		Here is some good blank verse from a poem called '' Sunrise on
Mansfield Mountain	ORGANIZATION	'' : `` Too still for dreaming , too divine for sleep , So range the firs , the constant , fearless ones .

		Warders of mountain secrets , there they wait , Each with his cloak about him , breathless , calm , And yet expectant , as who knows the dawn , And all night thrills with memory and desire , Searching in what has been for what shall be : The marvel of the ne'er familiar day , Sacred investiture of life renewed , The chrism of dew , the coronal of flame . ''

		The `` Stanford Rhymes '' of ''
Carolus Ager	PERSON	, '' whose real name is Mr.
Charles K. Field	PERSON	, are rather better than the average of college verse , and make a good showing brought together in a volume .

		They are alternately humorous and pathetic , with a good deal to say about '' co-eds '' and '' profs '' and love and wine .

		President
Jordan	PERSON	, however , takes pains to inform us that '' love and wine in youth are met - aphors only '' ; that the wine of these rhymes '' con - tains no alcohol , '' and that the love '' is not the serious fateful thing it seems . ''

		Whereat , we fancy , many a college youth will smile in wonder at the strange notions of the Olympians .

		There is a gleam of practical wisdom in Mr.
Field	PERSON	's verses here and there , as when , for example , the senior thus gives advice to the freshman : '' Study your head professor More than the books you buy ; The proper study of mankind Is man , you know , so try .

		Fathom his favorite hobby , Some hidden crank unearth , Whether it 's books or babies , just Work it for all it 's worth . ''

		Coming back again to serious poetry , after this momentary interlude , we find a welcome gift in Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's '' Hills of Song . '' ''

		Lo !

		I have fared and fared again Far up and down the ways of men , And found no path I strayed along As happy as the hills of song . ''

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	is at his best in verse that embodies some historical incident or reminiscence of travel .

		Here are some '' Memories of Como '' : ''
Triumphant Autumn	ORGANIZATION	sweeps from shore to shore , And works swift magic with her wand of fire ; She fills the hollows of the hills once more With amethyst , and like a golden lyre The woodlands gleam , and quiver , and suspire . ''

		I listen , and the low harmonic sound Quickens the happy past within my brain ; My spirit crosses with an ardent bound The severing ocean , and 1 float again On Como 's tranquil breast that bears no stain . ''

		The song of '' Taillefer the Trouvere , '' with which Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's volume opens , is a noteworthy poem in a fine swinging measure .

		A word concerning Mr.
Archibald Lampman	PERSON	's '' Lyrics of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' and we will end this lengthy review of the poetical product of the last few months .

		Mr.
Lampman	PERSON	is one of the truest and sweetest of the group of Canadian poets who have made them - selves heard of late , and he sings of nature because he knows her , not because he takes it to be the lit - erary fashion .

		It is only faithful and loving ob - servation that can help a man to such a stanza as the following : '' I see the broad rough meadow stretched away Into the crystal sunshine , wastes of sod , Acres of withered vervain , purple-gray , Branches of aster , groves of goldenrod ; And yonder , toward the sunlit summit , strewn With shadowy boulders , crowned and swathed with weed , Stand ranks of silken thistle , blown to seed , Long silver fleeces shining like the noon . ''

		Mr.
Lampman	PERSON	's verse combines this fidelity to the facts of nature with high qualities of imagination and passion ; it will both bear and repay a close examination .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		THE library of the late
Ernst Curtins	ORGANIZATION	is for sale .

		It includes about 3500 bound volumes and at least as many pamphlets .

		The collection is made especially valuable by the author 's numerous marginal annotations , and we should welcome its purchase by one of our American universities .

		THE DIAL 125 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Memoirs of Mr ' Fulton 's '' Memoirs of Freder - Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	, ick A. P. Barnard '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		trace the career of a man whose chief - est labors were spent in educational reform .

		In the main they show the man in his public capacity , where he seems to have possessed very great intel - lectual energy , and to have been as unfaltering as he was uncompromising in the pursuit of prin - ciple ; but in the first three chapters we get an idea of his remarkable personality .

		Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	, when nearly eighty years of age , still remembered and described with vididness the early associations of his childhood , the village school , with its plank benches of unpainted pine , the old meeting house , with its high-backed pews , its great pulpit , and the long ser - mon in which he took as little interest as did the or - dinary boy of the time .

		Although he enjoyed what were then considered good educational advantages , and won much distinction as a scholar at both Stock - bridge Academy and
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, he spoke depre - ciatingly of them in later life .

		His course at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, he said , was a process of self-education .

		Like many another student , he found that the best part of his education began after he received his bachelor 's de - gree .

		Graduating from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1828	DATE	, Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	began his pedagogical career as an assistant in the
Hartford Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	.

		He then became a tu - tor in mathematics in
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	; but at the end of a year his increasing deafness forced him back to
Hartford	LOCATION	, where he accepted an instructorship in the
American Institute	ORGANIZATION	for the Deaf and Dumb .

		He entered so earnestly into this work at
Hartford	LOCATION	, and later at
New York	LOCATION	, that he soon became a mas - ter in the principles and practice of deaf-mute instruction .

		From
1838	DATE	to
1854	DATE	he was connected with the
University of Alabama	ORGANIZATION	, where his skill as a teacher and organizer was a potent influence in bringing order out of the disorganized state into which that institution had been brought by the insub - ordination of its students .

		It was here that he wrote those important letters on College Govern - ment which centred upon him the attention of the prominent educators of the country .

		He next went to
Mississippi	LOCATION	, where his reputation as an educator and his power as an executive soon secured for him the Presidency of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He now inaugurated many important reforms , some of which were just reaching their consummation when the out - break of the Civil War brought to a sudden close these , as well as other , enterprises of peace .

		Al - though Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	, in his long residence at the South , had become a slaveholder , he at no time wavered in his opposition to secession .

		In
1864	DATE	he was elected to the Presidency of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, and from that time until his death , in
1889	DATE	, his life is the history of the important educational matters connected with that institution .

		As much of Mr.
Fulton	PERSON	's book is devoted to the exposition of Dr.
Barnard	PERSON	's opinions , the work is certain of a kind reception from all interested in higher education .

		Mr.
Roy Devereux	PERSON	's '' The Ascent of Woman '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is a clever little book wherein members of the '' ruder sex , '' as some innovating spirit impolitely styles it , may find themselves and their current interests pun - gently and thoughtfully discussed .

		Since
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer dismissed her with the curt definition , '' Women are grown-up children , '' woman has de - veloped capacities and advanced claims undreamed of in his philosophy .

		The worm -LRB- if we may ven - ture on the expression here -RRB- has turned ; the once bond are free ; the chrysalis has become the winged Psyche and , in fine , the poor-spirited creature of the primitive Hausfrau type contemplated by the German philosopher shows as a mere protoplasmic polyp , or mollusc , when compared with her highly evolved successor of to-day .

		It is the woman of to-day , rather than woman in the abstract , that our author discusses ; and he discusses her shrewdly , critically , sympathetically , and even comprehen - sively , in so far , at least , as a theme so complex can be viewed comprehensively by a single intellect .

		It is fair to Mr.
Devereux	PERSON	to say that he does not pre - tend to explain woman .

		Perhaps a genius may arise some day who will achieve this , and then turn his attention to the Hegelian philosophy .

		The intro - ductory chapter deals with '' The Criticism of Wo - man , '' after which the author goes on to discuss , under the main heads '' Of her Life '' and '' Of her Looks , '' such topics as : '' The Value of Love , '' '' The Practice of Marriage , '' `` The Sisterhood of Wo - man , '' '' The Progress of Fashion , '' '' On Color in Costume , '' '' The Superfluous , '' '' The Ideal , '' etc. .

		The author 's style savors of sound reading , his ideas are usually fresh and worth weighing , and his book altogether forms a refreshing contrast to the aver - age dissertation on its subject .

		If the '' new woman '' be half she claims to be , and what her judicious friends would fain believe her to be , it is surely high time to write of her and for her as if she were something more than
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's '' grown-up child , '' something more than the trifler whose mind is formed on the study of the '' Society Column '' and the contemplation of the '' fashion plate . ''

		Every woman of sense and spirit must resent the assumption , still common on the part of publishers of the hundred-and-one more or less trashy and inane journals gotten up for the express use and delecta - tion of her sex , that only the mildest sort of literary pap is congenial to the female palate and digestion .

		Mr.
Devereux	PERSON	pays his fair readers the compliment of assuming at the outset that their latter-day inter - est in serious things is not all a sham and fad of the hour .

		Most readers of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	will be & la .

		d to see a book .

		n
Browning	PERSON	's attitude toward Christianity ; or , more accurately speaking , of
Browning	PERSON	's presenta - tion of Christian doctrine .

		And
Browning	PERSON	students will naturally recognize in Dr.
Berdoe	PERSON	one singu - larly fitted for the task , by the knowledge of the poet 's works , and the appreciation , shown in pre - 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, vious books .

		Dr.
Berdoe	PERSON	himself gives further reason in an introductory note :
Browning	PERSON	has been to him a real apostle , whose work has been of the greatest success . ''


Browning	PERSON	and the Christian Faith '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comes , then , with good spon - sors : we think the volume will not be found to fall short of expectation .

		It is , as is indicated on the title-page , a systematized view of '' the evidences of Christianity from
Browning	PERSON	's point of view . ''

		We should not think of offering particular criticism upon such a book in the space at our command ; it must be sufficient to indicate the plan of the work and the success of the author in carrying out his plan .

		With regard to any such study , there would seem to be two questions which must be answered before we can estimate its value .

		First , can we be sure , in dealing with so dramatic a poet as
Brown	PERSON	- ing , that we have his own opinion in this or that quotation ?

		and , second , can we rightly make a system based upon quotations from the work of fifty years , without considering the chronology of the matter ?

		In other words , do we want a system of truth expressed in
Browning	PERSON	's words , or a statement of
Browning	PERSON	's own religious beliefs ?

		We do not think that Dr.
Berdoe	PERSON	is quite definite on these points .

		As to dramatic utterance , he points out that he seeks
Browning	PERSON	's own opinions : we think that although here and there he mistakes the sayings of the char - acter for the beliefs of the writer , he is generally in the right .

		But as to the second question , he has nothing to say .

		His quotations come from all parts of
Browning	PERSON	's works , and he leaves us in this dilemma : either
Browning	PERSON	never held this system in its entirety , or there was no development in his religious thought for half a century .

		Possibly this objection is that of the literary historian , who always desires to know what was the actual fact ; many lovers of
Browning	PERSON	will desire , rather , to know what was
Browning	PERSON	's testimony through life to a system of universal truth .

		In the '' Life , Letters , and Journal of
Maria Mitchell	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we get a view of one of the ablest women and most interesting characters of the present generation .

		Showing a decided taste for astronomy at a period when there was no school in the world where she could be taught either this or the higher mathematics , when even
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	had no better telescope than the home instrument belonging to Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, when astronomy was regarded as akin to alchemy , the contributions of Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	to astronomical science are fully entitled to be con - sidered independent , if not original .

		Her services as an educator are scarcely less distinguished .

		Her method was through stimulus and not through drill ; she held the marking system in contempt , but hun - dreds of Vassar alumnae and students testify to her immense force on their lives .

		Her influence upon the pupils who were her daily companions was per - manent , character-moulding , and unceasingly pro- gressive .

		Her study in the observatory of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, surrounded by the evidences of her honor - able professional career , came to be regarded by many as a pilgrim-shrine of life , and her personality was so strong that it gave astronomy a prominence at
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	such as it has had in few colleges either for men or women .

		The narrative of this life is told with reserve and dignity , but with sufficient fulness , by a sister , Mrs.
Phebe Mitchell Kendall	PERSON	.

		Mr.
H. S. Salt	PERSON	, who is known as an
Thoreau	PERSON	as a j , , .

		.

		.

		mi t i Great Writer .

		editor of a portion of Thoreau s col - lected works , and as a writer about
Thoreau	PERSON	from a very appreciative and even eulo - gistic point of view , has given , in his life of Tho - reau for Mr.
Walter Scott	PERSON	's series of '' Great Writ - ers '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- an abridged and revised edition of his earlier work , published in
1890	DATE	.

		In the case of Thoreau there is less material for a biography than in that of almost any other figure in literature .

		His was neither a life of the family , nor of the community , nor of the nation , nor even of the republic of letters ; it had no events , no career ; there was only the set inwardness of growth of a life hid with nature .

		So , the very little material the biographer finds must be made much of , even in so small a work as this .

		Still , this is a sufficiently readable and accurate account .

		The three last chapters discuss
Thoreau	PERSON	as man and writer .

		Mr.
Salt	PERSON	regards him as most akin to Rich - ard Jefferies ; but he is certainly wide of the mark in supposing that
Thoreau	PERSON	could have written the sentence quoted on page 189 .

		Thoreau never '' fan - cied '' anything ; his method of expression was ab - solutely direct .

		Mr.
Salt	PERSON	thinks the future will rank Thoreau as '' no mere Emersonian disciple , '' but as a '' master-mind , '' '' by far the most inspired , stimulating , and vital personality of all the
Concord	LOCATION	group . ''

		- To consider the Anglo-Saxon para - .

		Caedmon as a separate and original epic , and read it in comparison with
Milton	LOCATION	, is to commit one 's self to appreciative , rather than scho - lastic and elucidative , endeavor .

		This is chiefly what the Rev.
S. Humphreys Gurteen	PERSON	, in his '' Epic of the Fall of Man : A Comparative Study of Caed - mon ,
Dante	PERSON	, and Milton '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has , as he avows himself , attempted .

		Dante is brought in only for the chapter on the torture-house of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	version and the hell of '' Paradise Lost , '' and the Caedmonian poem is treated frankly as the homo - geneous product of the bard of
Whitby	LOCATION	; so that a perusal of the book resolves itself into a purely aesthetic weighing of the Old-English work with the performance of the great Puritan .

		Here , since '' Paradise Lost '' is notoriously the most artificial poem in the language , it is not hard to agree with Mr.
Gurteen	PERSON	in finding many places where Caedmon is the more freshly pleasing .

		The conception of Eve , notably and perhaps not unaccountably , is a case in point .

		Probably one of the results of the Anglo-Saxon revival in this century is destined to be
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 a still more frequent turning back to the undulled pages of Old-English literature .

		Mr.
Gurteen	PERSON	uses his own careful translation of the paraphrase , and the volume further embodies reduced facsimiles of the curious and interesting illuminations of the Jun - ian manuscript , taken from the facsimiles originally published by the
London	LOCATION
Society of Antiquaries	ORGANIZATION	.

		A reference book Mr - F - J -
Stimson	PERSON	assures us that his for labor laws in '' Hand-Book to the Labor Law of the
United	ORGANIZATION	states .

		the United States '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the result of an attempt to set forth , as it exists in the
United States	LOCATION	to-day , that law of labor disputes and the regulation of industrial affairs and the pro- tection of employees , which has had its greatest de - velopment in the last few years . ''

		There is no attempt at exhaustive treatment , and the volume is not even dignified with the claim of being a law text-book .

		It is intended for general use , and has the undoubted merit of dealing with a thoroughly live public question in a most interesting and intelli - gent manner .

		Just now there are perhaps no ques - tions of more vital concern to the vast army of wage-earners than those which are considered in this hand-book .

		The chapter on strikes , boycotts , and lockouts is one of the fullest , both in its statement of the law as it is found on the statute-books of the various States and of the views of courts upon the various phases of the labor question , which have been brought before them for adjudication .

		The comments of the author are generally fair , and his judgments seem to be sustained by the better rea - son .

		The citation of cases is numerous enough to fulfil the purpose of the book , and the copious foot - notes add to its value .

		The book well supplies a need with that class who do not care for an exhaus - tive or very technical treatment of the subject .

		Readers who think they have got True realism gome notion of warfare from an emo - tional and illiterate book like '' The Red Badge of Courage '' may be commended to such a work as
Colonel Edward Anderson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Camp Fire Stories '' -LRB-
Star Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as a corrective .

		Colonel
Anderson	PERSON	served as a cavalry officer in the
Southwest	LOCATION	during the greater part of our Civil War , and had his full share of the soldier 's experience .

		A clergyman before and after , the fighting instinct was too strong to be resisted during those four event - ful years , and he fought Southerners in the field as vigorously as he had been wont to fight Satan in the pulpit .

		The stories that he tells us are not so much of battles , however , as of the incidental phases of army life ; they are in turn pathetic and shrewdly humorous , and give us many glimpses of the day - by-day life of camp , bivouac , and hospital .

		They are , moreover , happily mellowed in the retrospect of riper years , infused with the kindliest feeling , and far more effective in their unpretentious way than many a more ambitious portrayal of army life .

		The au - thor expresses a hope that his book '' may make many an eye that grows rheumy with age flash out again the old fires of years ago , and many a young face light up with a new-born patriotism , '' and we do not doubt that it will produce both the one effect and the other .

		Mr.
W. G. Wood-Martin	PERSON	presents a Antiquities of summary of the knowledge concern -

		J ... - , - , / - , , .

		.

		ing the antiquities oi Pre-Christian
Ireland	LOCATION	, in a work entitled '' Pagan
Ireland	LOCATION	, an Archaeological Sketch '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		There are few richer fields for the student in archaeology .

		The field has been diligently worked , but the results are to be found only by a prodigious ransacking of jour - nals , transactions , and proceedings , not easily ac - cessible .

		Our author is an authority ; both as field - worker and writer , he is well-known ; his studies of Irish Lake Dwellings and Rude Stone Mon - ments are classic .

		He is , then , eminently qualified for the task he undertakes in this book .

		He has accomplished it well .

		The whole field is traversed , and the six hundred pages of close print , with more than four hundred illustrations , make the work what the author claims a handbook of Irish Pre -
Christian Antiquities	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is an excellent index , and a classified bibliography of six hundred and more numbers , some of which comprise several ref - erences .

		The general reader will find the book interesting ; the archaeologist will find it indispens - able .

		The portions dealing with '' traces of the elder faiths , '' superstitions connected with stones , and the use of stones in divination and cursing , will particularly please most readers .

London	LOCATION	.

		j o investigating the origin , meaning , and historic value of ''
London	LOCATION	Street Names '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Visitors to
London	LOCATION	have time out of mind been used to puzzle over such seeming freaks of municipal nomenclature as ''
Petticoat Lane	PERSON	, '' `` Pudding Lane , '' `` Mincing Lane , '' '' Bull-and - Mouth St. , '' '' Camomile St. , '' '' St.
Margaret Pat	PERSON	- tens , '' and so on ; and these mysteries Mr.
Habben	PERSON	elucidates briefly and for the most part conclusively .

		Much of
London	LOCATION	history is epitomized in these quaint names of old streets and courts , which have endured like monumenta cere perenniora of a buried past ; and therefore the author has in some cases not hesitated to be rather discursive .

		Usually , how - ever , the names are dismissed with a brief state - ment of their origin .

		The reader will find the book a useful supplement to the excellent works on Lon - don of Mr.
Lof	PERSON	tie and Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		The English Cathedrals .

		Mrs.
Julia C. R. Dorr	PERSON	is one of the latest travellers to write a book about the English cathedrals , which , though they may be less perfect than their fellows across the channel , are demonstrably perennial in their charm .

		`` A Cathedral Pilgrimage '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives an account , in readable woman 's English , of visits to
Wells	LOCATION	,
Salisbury	LOCATION	,
Ely	PERSON	,
Peterborough	LOCATION	, Lin - coln ,
Durham	LOCATION	,
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, and
Exeter	LOCATION	.

		There is 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, a bit of historiography now and then , some of the anecdote of travel , and some frank , if rather ex - alted , impression .

		The papers , which are partic - ularly designed to bring to '' true cathedral lovers '' at home '' the delight of personal knowledge and intimacy , '' make also a volume which will take little room , and probably not come amiss , in the tourist 's knapsack .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Lorenzo de '
Medici	PERSON	is the subject of the last volume introduced , somewhat equivocally perhaps , into the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , of which some seventeen have already appeared under the gen - eral editorship of Mr.
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	.

		The book may be thought to derive a kind of fanciful timeliness since the discovery
last year	DATE	of the bodies of the great despot and his brother in the
New Sacristy of San Lorenzo	LOCATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Lorenzo 's latest biographer , Mr.
E. Arm	PERSON	- strong , does not pretend to be definitive , and many per - sons may find his interpretation a bit ideal , yet the ques - tions in dispute are for the most part freshly and sanely put . ''

		A Text-Book of the History of Architecture '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
A. D. F. Hainlin	PERSON	, and `` A History of Architecture for the Student , Craftsman , and

Banister Fletcher	PERSON	and Mr.
Banister F. Fletcher	PERSON	, are single-volume treat - ises for the student and the general reader .

		Both are abundantly illustrated , but the work of the Messrs.
Fletcher	PERSON	has the more attractive plates , and is the more extensive treatise of the two . ''

		Macaulay 's and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's Essays on
Samuel John	PERSON	- son , '' edited by Mr.
William Strunk , Jr.	PERSON	, are published in a neat volume by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
John Murphy & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a little booklet entitled '' How to Speak Latin , a Series of
Latin Dia	LOCATION	- logues with English Translation . ''

		The book is by Mr.
Stephen W. Wilby	PERSON	, and is divided into four depart - ments : Forms of Speaking , Dialogues , Readings , and Wisdom of the Ages , the last being a collection of more or less familiar Latin aphorisms . ''

		The
Oxford Manuals	ORGANIZATION	of English History '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- are designed to provide students with elementary text-books dealing with special periods in the spirit of the most recent scholarship , yet affording , when taken together , a resume of the entire history of
England	LOCATION	.

		The books are to be six in number , under the editorship of Mr.
C. W. C. Oman	PERSON	, and three of them have been received by us . ''

		The Making of the English Nation , '' by Mr.
C. G. Robertson	PERSON	; '' King and Baronage , '' by Mr.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	; and `` King and Parliament , '' by Mr.
G. H. Wakeling	PERSON	, are the titles .

		These volumes are one , two , and five , of the projected series , leaving '' The Hundred Years ' War , '' `` England and the Reforma - tion , '' and '' The Making of the British Empire '' yet to be supplied .

		The work appears to be very well done , is uniform in scale and method , and may be warmly recommended to teachers of English history .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Briimmer 's '' Lexicon of German Authors '' contains about five thousand names .

		It is stated that the Norwegian government has re - cently done away with the study of Latin and Greek in the higher schools of that country .


Herr Bjornson	PERSON	announces that he will hereafter live in

		Dr.
Newton Bateman	PERSON	and Mr.
Paul Selby	PERSON	are en - gaged in the preparation of a '' Historical Encyclopedia of
Illinois	LOCATION	, '' which promises to be an interesting and valuable work .

		Dr.
Charles Lotin Hildreth	PERSON	died in
New York	LOCATION	a few days ago , from nervous prostration brought on by the terrific heat of
August	DATE	.

		He was forty years of age , and will be remembered as the author of '' The Masque of Death , and Other Poems , '' a volume of considerable value .

		Mr.
J. E. C. Bodley	PERSON	, an English scholar , has been at work for the past six years upon a book which will do for modern
France	LOCATION	about what Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has done for the United States in his '' American Commonwealth . ''

		The first volume will be published this fall by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a new edition , in three volumes , of Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	's '' History of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, '' with a lengthy additional chapter on '' The Externals of the Modern City , '' prepared by Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	.

		Those having the old editions of Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	's work may obtain Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's edition in a volume by itself .

		Professor
Josiah D wight Whitney	PERSON	, of
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , died on the nineteenth of
August	DATE	, at the age of seventy-six .

		He was an elder brother of the late
W. D. Whitney	PERSON	, and the highest mountain in the
United States	LOCATION	bears his name , a deserved tribute to his high rank as a geologist .

		His name is associated with that of the late Dr.
J. W. Foster	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, in the well-known Foster and
Whitney	LOCATION	's Report on the Geology of the Lake Su - perior Region .

		We learn that work has actually begun on the impor - tant enterprise of reprinting , in French and English , the extended series of '' Jesuit Relations , '' projected by Messrs.
Burrows Brothers of Cleveland	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sixty volumes of three hundred pages each , and five years of time , will be required ; the volumes appearing at the rate of one a month .

		The work is all to be done in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, at the Imperial Press ; and the type is to be set by ma - chinery .

		Mr.
R. G. Thwaites	PERSON	is the editor of the series .

		We find the following interesting note in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail , '' the leading English-printed journal of
Japan	LOCATION	: '' We understand that the chair of English Literature in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	is to be filled by Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	; Professor Wood , its hitherto occupant , being about to return to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	is very fortunate in obtaining the services of a literary star like Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	.

		Our readers may not be aware that Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	is a naturalized Japanese , and that , in the country of his adoption , he is known as Mr.
Iwai	PERSON	- zumi Yakumo .

		It will , perhaps , be referred to by and by as a singular fact that whereas the chair of Japanese Literature in the
University	ORGANIZATION	was , until recently , filled by a British subject , Mr.
Basil Hall Chamberlain	PERSON	, the chair of English Literature is now to be occupied by a Japanese subject . ''

		The papers outside the descriptive and the critical are little ser - mons , ideal sermons let no one uninstructed by them take fright at the title ; they are not preachments ; they are of the sermon 's right length , of about as long to read as the passage of a cathedral chant in the ear , and keeping throughout to the plain step of daily speech , they leave a sense of stilled singing on the mind they fill ... Lessons in composition of sound and vibrant English . ''

		I believe that this is the first time that any attempt has been made to study the marking of animals in detail , with the view of reaching what seems to be the real , or at all events the proximate , cause of their exist - ence .

		Mr.
Tylor	PERSON	and Mr.
Poulton	PERSON	, Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	and Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	have studied the coloration of animals ; but , as far as I am aware , no attempt has been hitherto made to account for certain markings which occur , as one might say , in a sort of plan , and in so many different animals .

		BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		The announcements of forthcoming books , collected by us from the publishing houses of the
United States	LOCATION	, and classified for reference and comparison in the present issue of THE DIAL , indicate that the production of literature is not seriously interfered with by the business depression of the country .

		The returns show an increase in the activities that cooperate in the making of books , and it would seem that whatever region or locality is the modern and American equivalent of
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	is in greater danger of over-population than it has been in the past .

		Following our established custom at this season of the year , we not only publish what is practically a full list of the an - nouncements thus far made , but select also for the convenience of the hurried reader.what seem to be the most important of the many hundreds of titles given under the several categories .

		In the department of History , one undertak - ing is so large that all the others are dwarfed by comparison .

		We refer of course to the sixty - volume edition of the '' Jesuit Relations , '' un - der the direction of Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, of which monthly volumes are promised to begin at an early date . ''

		A Political History of
England	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	; '' The Rise and Growth of the
English Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
W. H. S. Aubrey	PERSON	; and the second volume of the '' Constitutional History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by
George Ticknor Curtis	PERSON	, are among the most important remaining announcements .

		We also note four new volumes in the useful series called '' Periods of European History '' ; the slapdash magazine '' History of the
Last Quarter Century	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by President
E. B. Andrews	PERSON	; ''
Europe	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages , '' by Messrs.
Thatcher	PERSON	and
Schwill	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	; the '' Journals '' of
Alexander Henry	PERSON	of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	Com - pany , edited by Dr.

Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by General
T. F. Rodenbough	PERSON	and
Major W. L. Haskin	PERSON	; '' The Puritan in
England	LOCATION	and

E. H. Byington	PERSON	; a '' History of the German Struggle for Liberty , '' by Mr.

Eire	ORGANIZATION	's '' Diary of a Citizen of
Paris	LOCATION	during the Terror , '' and of the impor - tant work of Dr.
Crestos Tsountas	PERSON	on '' The Mycenaean Age . ''

		The biographical list includes several num - bers that will be eagerly awaited ; as , for ex - ample , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's life of
J. G. Lock	PERSON	- hart ; the autobiography and memoir -LRB- the latter by his widow -RRB- of
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	; and the autobiography of Mrs.
Mary Cowden Clarke	PERSON	.

		Other biographies that are sure to be found interesting are Mr.
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's
George Washington	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Lynn Linton	PERSON	's '' My Literary Life , '' Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	's
John Wellborn Koot	PERSON	, Mr.
T. K. Lothrop	PERSON	's
W. H. Seward	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Lathrop	PERSON	's memories of her father ,
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	.

		Two studies of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, one by Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	and the other by Mr.
Thomas Donaldson	PERSON	, will find their special circle of readers .

		Interesting also will be '' The Brontes and their Circle , '' edited by Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	and Dr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, and '' The Story of My Life , '' by Mr.
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	.

		The long-promised letters of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, edited by
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	, will appear soon in an English translation , and will add an important document to French literary history .

		Among other very important works in the de - partment of literary history and criticism , we have to chronicle the extensive study of Shake - speare , by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	; an eight - volume series of '' Periods of European Litera - ture , '' edited by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	; and the third volume of the '' History of English Literature , '' by the late Professor ten Brink .

		The follow - ing titles also catch the eye and the imagina - tion of the student of literature : '' Mere Liter - ature and Other Essays , '' by Mr.
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	; '' Talks about Autographs , '' by Mr.
George Birkbeck	PERSON	Hill ; '' Victorian Influ - ences , '' by Mr.
Frederick Harrison	PERSON	; '' The Bible in Old English Writers , '' by Dr.

H. W. Mabie	PERSON	; '' Modern French Litera - ture , '' by Mr.
Benjamin W. Wells	PERSON	; and '' The Literature of Music , '' by Mr.
J. E. Matthew	PERSON	.

		Poetry , new and old , offers several attractive announcements .

		Of new poetry , for example , we shall have '' The Seven Seas , '' by Mr.
Hud	PERSON	- yard Kipling ; ''
Judith	PERSON	and Holofernes , '' by Mr.
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	; and a third volume of the poems of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	.

		Among new edi - tions of the older poets none will be , perhaps , more welcome than
Miss Guiney	PERSON	's edition of
Henry Vaughan	PERSON	, which we know beforehand will be a work of the fullest love and sympathy .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	announces eight new reprints , including
Rossetti	PERSON	's translation of '' La
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, '' '' Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; and a book of lyrics from Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	has prepared '' A New Anthology '' of poems '' chosen from the minor and less familiar English poets . ''

		There will be a ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	in one volume ; an edition of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	, prepared by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	; and a complete
Browning	PERSON	, in two volumes , edited by Mr. Au - gustine
Birrell	PERSON	.

		In fiction , the most interesting announcement is probably that of '' Quo Vadis , '' by Mr.
Sien	PERSON	- kiewicz .

		It is hardly too much to say that this Polish novelist is the greatest figure that has appeared in European literature during the past decade .

		A few of the more promising titles in this department are Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Sir
George Tressady	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's ''
Taqui	PERSON	- sara , '' Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's '' The Other House '' and '' The Spoils of Poynton , '' Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	's `` A Convert of the Mission , '' Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's ''
Rodney Stone	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's '' The Maker of Moons , '' Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's '' A Puri - tan 's Wife , '' Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's `` The City of Refuge , '' and Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	's `` The
Herb Moon	PERSON	. ''

		Among new editions , we find such noteworthy enterprises as the '' Riverside ''
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, in sixteen volumes ; '' The Writings of
Bret Harte	PERSON	, '' in fourteen volumes ; twenty-eight more volumes of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's edition of
Balzac	LOCATION	; a six - volume edition of Lane 's '' Arabian Nights , '' a dozen more volumes of Captain Marryat in their beautiful new garb ; and an edition de luxe , in thirty-four volumes , of the '' Complete Works of
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' reedited by their author .

		The literature of travel and description has assumed unusually large proportions during the past few years , and the new books promised indicate a continuous demand for new informa - tion about the round world and its peoples .

		We note as of especial interest , '' The Near East , '' by Mr.
Henry Norman	PERSON	; '' In the South Seas , '' by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	; '' Sketches from the
United States of North America	LOCATION	, '' from the Russian of Mr.
A. P. Tverskoy	PERSON	; '' Impressions of
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.

		From the other departments of book produc - tion , important as they are , we have space to glean but a few prominent examples .

		A mag - nificent edition of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's drawings for the '' Inferno '' is in course of preparation .

		Two other large undertakings are '' A System of Medicine , '' in seven volumes , edited by Mr.
T. C. Allbutt	PERSON	; and ''
Harper	PERSON	's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities , '' edited by Mr.
H. T. Peck	PERSON	.

		We must also mention the fact that a new edition of Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	's
Shakespeare Concordance	ORGANIZATION	is offered at about half the price of the earlier one .

		A few more attractive titles are these : '' The Music of the Modern World , '' edited by Mr.
Anton Seidl	PERSON	and
Miss Fanny M. Smith	PERSON	; '' Problems of Modern Democracy , '' by Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	; * ' Governments and Parties of

John Ruskin	PERSON	; '' The Old Testament and Modern Life , '' by the Rev.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	; '' Christianity and Patriotism , '' by Count Tolstoy ; and the important series en - titled '' Philosophy in its National Develop - ments , '' of which the first volumes will be ''
Phil	PERSON	- osophy of
India	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	, '' Philosophy of
America	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	; and '' Philosophy of Buddhism , '' by Professor
Rhys Davids	PERSON	and Mrs.
Davids	PERSON	.

		Of books prepared especially for the holiday season we make no mention at present , partly because the lists are as yet very incomplete , and partly because our limits forbid .

		Enough has been said to indicate that the '' general reader , '' and even the specialist in most directions , will find it quite as hard as ever , if not even harder , to keep abreast of the current of new thought and new literary expression during the coming year .

		The list of forthcoming books , viewed as a whole , is not only considerably larger than any we have heretofore published , but seems also a richer and weightier one than any of its predecessors .

		THE LATEST CRITIC OF DEMOCRACY .

		* The familiar name of the English historian Lecky awakens eager expectations and quick - ens curiosity .

		His previous studies of past pe - riods , as he himself modestly suggests , '' brings with it kinds of knowledge and methods of rea - soning that may be of some use in the discussion of contemporary questions . ''

		The main pur - pose of his latest work is to show the growth of modern democracy and its effects upon lib - erty of thought and action , and upon character .

		The merely negative word '' liberty '' does not really express the scope of the field traversed , and the writer shows that it is the influence of popular government on life , morality , culture , and happiness , which he has in mind .

		His standpoint is avowedly and manifestly that of one who believes in liberalism and individual - ism , and whose class sympathies are with the heirs of wealth and culture .

		He sees with absolute clearness that political power has passed finally and irrevocably into the hands of a majority whose capacity is not yet fully known , and that the descendants of the former ruling classes must struggle for a hearing and a place .

		He sees that this newly acquired possession of political power gives the control of army ,
navy	ORGANIZATION	, taxing machinery , legislation , administration , judiciary , and the organs of instruction , to those who have thus far been deprived of a dominant place in the government under which they live .

		He thinks that this new majority is and must long remain , for the most part , ignorant and coarse , and that their government must place liberty and culture in constant peril .

		He says : '' One of the great divisions of politics in our day is coming to be whether , at the last resort , the world should he governed by its ignorance or by its intelligence .

		According to one party , the preponderating power should be with education and property .

		According to the other , the ultimate source of power , the supreme right of ap - peal and of control , belongs legitimately to the majority of the nation told by the head , or , in other words , to the poorest , the most ignorant , the most incapable , who are necessarily the most numerous . ''

		But does it follow , a democrat may reply , that it is so necessary that the majority must be without property and without intelligence ?

		According to his own showing , later in the work , the working classes have made immense advance in securing property and intelligence .

		Pestalozzi selected wayward chil - dren for the test of his pedagogic philosophy .


Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	appealed to a rude audience , but no statesman ever appealed to nobler senti - ments when he addressed the lords and bishops or the dons of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is strange that so learned and liberal a man should not see that the very illiteracy which alarms him is a pro- duct of the malfeasance in office of the classes he praises ; not a product of nature , but of un - holy neglect on the part of the privileged nobility and clergy .

		They who possessed the national wealth failed to educate the nation 's children , and now despise them for being ignorant .

		Partial as these main contentions are , there is much which democrats may well ponder .

		An easy optimism may expect large harvest with - out fertilization , tillage , and seeding .

		If democ - racy fails now it will be the fault of its leaders , and these leaders may learn more of their ene - mies than of their friends .

		The book before us can hardly be called inductive in method .

		It is more like a polit - ical argument .

		From the start there is a posi - tion to be maintained , a thesis to be proved .

		The past reign of aristocracy is praised , its virtues are exalted , its services estimated at their highest value , its sins and follies either passed over in silence or gently extenuated .

		Democracy is hunted down in all modern lands and searched for flaw and weakness ; its faults of passion and inexperience , of raw youth and impetuous revolt , are exposed to the most pow - erful light , and made to appear in their most frightful forms .

		But even these exaggerations have a basis in history , and are untrue only because the facts are drawn out of proportion .

		Even a photograph will magnify the nearer objects beyond their relative right .

		Democracy and liberty are two large words , and they invite us into almost every field of current interest .

		Our guide is one of the most accomplished and instructed of his age .

		A great and industrious author has ransacked the history of the century for his materials .

		Of the simple direct style , it is needless to speak ; it is so good that you never think about it , but only of the subject in hand .

		The book begins with an account of English representative government in the eighteenth century .

		One can see the author looking back over his shoulder with regret at the stately forms of nobles who fade ghostlike on the threshhold of our century .

		If only we could bring back the day that is dead , and awake the voice that is still , how happy we might be !

		Each great interest was represented by people who had '' a stake in the country , '' and the rabble had no organ of speech .

		But
Kousseau	PERSON	's doctrine of equal manhood suffrage was revolu - tionary .

		Modern politicians must pander to a less gentlemanly constituency , and it is only nat - ural that they should fall into sycophancy and employ bribery ; that they should use the taxing power to purchase the favor of ignorant and im - poverished voters at the cost of men of wealth .

		French and American life furnish illustra - tions of the defects of popular rule .

		We are nowhere reminded of the story told by Mr.
D. B. Eaton	PERSON	about the fight for civil service reform in
Great Britain	LOCATION	; nor are we told that the same great democratic movement which gave hope to the multitude brought a higher purity to the servants of the crown .

		Our ''
Molly Maguires	PERSON	, '' our spoils system , our lax natural - ization customs , and our municipal corruption , are held up for deserved castigation , and are treated as natural fruits of democracy .

		Turning to the effects of the extended fran - chise upon
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the author tells the painful story of the Irish Land Question , and of the attacks on property recommended by
Henry George	PERSON	; calls attention to the growth of taxation in all modern countries ; excites dread of the financial burden of popular education ; and objects to the tendency to throw all taxation upon one class .

		And a remedy for all this abuse of popular power ?

		More of the same kind in its most democratic form , the Referendum .

		He is pleased with the Referendum because it seems to wear out the patience of the multitude and make them tired of going to the polls .

		A valuable chapter is devoted to
Upper Chambers	ORGANIZATION	in various legislatures .

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	admits that the spectacle of a yawning bench of noble lords dawdling over the affairs of an empire is not altogether edifying .

		He sug - gests measures which may render that body more truly representative of the higher classes and of conservative influences .

		The effects of democracy on the liberty of the world are to be traced in the changes of feelings about nationality and international relations .

		Great peoples have discerned that secession can not be tolerated .

		The
United States	LOCATION	was compelled to maintain national unity by a war of coercion .

		Italy could never defend itself from foreign aggression so long as the states were separate .

		Religious liberty has been extended with democracy , and '' the religious sentiment has
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		DIAL not decayed , and it is certainly not less genuine because it is no longer fortified by privilege , or connected with interested and hypocritical as - sents . ''

		The universities have ^ ppened their doors to Dissenters .

		But , the author holds , the restraint of anti-social conduct which wears a mask of religion is always justifiable .

		The suttee was rightly abolished in
India	LOCATION	, and poly - gamy made a crime in
Utah	LOCATION	.

		When democracy does conclude to use repression it is less will - ing to compromise than is a monarchy or an aristocracy , and there is a tendency to regulate conduct in all directions .

		The working classes , now risen to power , are indifferent to dogma .

		Religion promotes social welfare , and is less busy with distinctions of creed or ritual .

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	is not altogether pessimistic .

		English character , in spite of democracy , has improved .

		Philanthropy has diminished the chief sources of crime .

		There has been a marked improvement in the decorum and hu - manity of the bulk of the poor .

		The skilled artisans have become '' not only the most ener - getic , but also one of the most intelligent and orderly elements , in English life . ''

		Some good things are said even of
America	LOCATION	; of our cour - age in war , our generosity to the vanquished , our payment of the national debt , and much of our penal and civil legislation .

		The private character of our citizens must not be judged by the state of our municipal governments .

		It was impossible to avoid a discussion of the influence of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	on democracy .

		To Englishmen the Irish priests are objects of keenest interest .

		The Catholic clergy have come to be a class apart from the best elements of society .

		Skepticism has detached the most intelligent layman , the '' chief moderating and restraining influence in the church , and it has thrown the direction of that great organization more and more into the hands of priests and fanatics . ''

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	recommends two laws : one to make '' the introduction of politics into chapels , and the actual or threatened depriva - tion of religious rites on account of a political vote , a criminal offense punishable by severe penalties '' ; the other '' a law putting an end to all personal interference or participation of priests at elections , except as simple voters . ''

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	charges the priests with employing the confessional and the pulpit as agencies of political control , and declares that they are guilty of numerous acts of complicity with crime .

		In general , the author thinks , clerical influence over politics has diminished .

		Full religious liberty , civil marriage , national educa - tion , have advanced everywhere , even in coun : tries under papal influence .

		The tendency of democracy to meddle and regulate is illustrated by the modern Sjun , day laws , restrictions upon gambling an $ drinking habits , and the statutes on marriage and di - vorce .

		He places a high value .

		.

		on a compul - sory rest day , but criticizes the tendency to sup - press wholesome
Sunday	DATE	recreations . ''

		Those have , indeed , much to answe.r for who have for generations deprived the , -LRB- poor of all means of innocent recreation and mental improvement on their only holiday . ''

		Democracy and Socialism are closely con - nected .

		A brief , sketch of Utopias introduces an account of the rmo ^ ern socialistic theories and movements .

		, The economic analysis and i .

		The conclusion reached is : '' The sense of right and wrong ; the feeling x of family affection ; the essential difference of men in aptitudes , capacities , and character , are things that can never be changed , and all schemes and policies that ignore them are doomed to ultimate fail - ure . ''

		The treatment of the question of usury in the canon law ignores the recent work of the German students and of Professor
Ashley	PERSON	.

		In touching the history of charities , the great work of
Ratzinger	PERSON	is not mentioned .

		Apparently Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	is more familiar with , French than he is with German writers .

		A very readable account is given of modern factory legislation , trades unions , and patronage .

		Mr.
GUman	PERSON	's work and argument on profit-sharing , and , Mr.
Schloss	PERSON	's criticism , are not noticed .

		One of the most valu - able chapters is that which treats of the industrial and political movements on behalf of women .

		A gleam of light relieves the later pages , and a way out of the perils of democracy is indi - cated . ''

		The great hope of our industrial future is that the working classes will master these principles , and abstain from seeking , proximate benefits at the cost pf ultimate disaster . ''

		The dangers of a corrupt and ostentatious plutoc - racy are faithfully depicted . ''

		Merrie En - gland '' furnishes an expressive quotation : ''

C. R. HENDERSON	PERSON	, , 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, THE WARFARE OF SCIENCE .

		* The nervous system of the animal kingdom is primarily a device for making locomotion safe .

		The mind , using the word in the broadest sense , is the function of the nervous system .

		The reflex action of the ganglion is the type of all mind processes .

		Through the sensory nerves , impressions of the external world are received by the brain or central ganglion .

		The brain has no source of knowledge other than this .

		All human knowledge comes through human experience .

		The function of the brain is , sit - ting in darkness , to convert sensory impres - sions into impulses of action .

		To this end are developed the motor nerves which pass from the brain and other ganglia outward to the muscles .

		The sensory organs are the brain 's sole teachers , the muscles are its sole servants .

		The essence of the intellect , as distinguished from reflex or instinctive action , is the prep - aration for motor responses to external stim - ulus .

		As the conditions of life grow more complicated , the possible ways in which sen - sation may go over into action grow more nu - merous .

		It is the function of the intellect to consider these , and of the will to choose .

		The condition of safety in life is to choose the right response .

		Wrong choice leads to failure and death .

		From this , by the process of natural selec - tion , comes the intense practicality of the senses .

		They tell us the truth as to external things , in so far as this truth has been necessary to the right action of our ancestors .

		Those of our predecessors who did not '' see things as they really are , '' to the degree that their life pro- cesses demanded , have died leaving no descend - ants .

		Our own ancestors , through all the generations , have been creatures of adequate sensations .

		Were it not so , they would have been inadequate to cope with their environment .

		In other words , the sensations their brains translated into action were truthful enough to make action safe .

		That our ordinary sensa - tions and our deductions from them are truth - ful so far as they go , is shown by the safety found in trusting them .

		This is shown also by the instruments of precision which are the tools of science .

		That instruments of precision like - wise tell the truth , is shown by the fact that we can trust our lives to them .

		That they are * A HISTORY OF THE WARFARE OF SCIENCE WITH THE - OLOGY IN

		more trustworthy than the unaided senses , is shown by their greater safety .

		But while our senses tell the truth as to familiar things , as rocks and trees , foods and shelter , friends and enemies , they do not tell the whole truth .

		They go only as far as safety in life has compelled them to go .

		Chemical composition they do not show .

		Objects too small to be handled are too small to be seen .

		Bodies too distant to be reached are never cor - rectly apprehended .

		Accuracy of sense grows less as the square of the distance increases ; and sun and stars , clouds and sky , are in fact very different from what they seem .

		Other mental processes arise to produce con - fusion .

		Memory pictures readily blend them - selves with realities .

		The nervous system of the one individual is readily affected by the conditions existing in another .

		Men are gre - garious creatures , and their speech gives them the power to add to their own ideas and expe - riences the ideas and experiences of others .

		Thus , many actions are based , not on our own sensations , but on the sensations of others .

		Readiness of suggestion and the instinct of con - ventionality are elements of great importance in insuring the safety of gregarious creatures .

		Thousands of men are saved daily through con - ventionality .

		These leave descendants with like instincts and impulses .

		With all this , the growth of each individual must be determined by his own experience . ''

		My mind to me a kingdom is . ''

		About the sense impressions formed in my own brain , I must build up my own universe .

		Thus it comes that each accretion of human knowledge must be thrown into terms of our previous experi - ence .

		Stated in these terms , it is always imper - fectly stated .

		By processes of suggestion and conventionality , the ideas of the individual become assimilated to those of the multitude .

		Thus tradition and myths arise to account for phenomena not clearly related to the ordinary experiences of life .

		It has been evident to man in all ages that there lie about him forces stronger than he , invisible and intangible , inscrutable as to their real nature , but none the less potent to bring about results .

		He can not easily trace cause and effect in dealing with these forces , and it is natural that he should doubt the existence of causality in the phenomena they produce .

		All races of men capable of continued thought have come to believe in the existence of something outside themselves , whose power is without hu - man limitations .

		Through the imagination of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 great poets , these forces become personified .

		Anthropomorphism is inevitable , because each man , in his thought , must bring all forces to his own measure .

		Into his own universe all that he knows must come .

		It is perfectly safe , in the ordinary affairs of life , to believe in gods and fates , imps and elves , norns and demons .

		It is quite as con - sistent with ordinary virtue and effectiveness to believe in these as it is to have the vague faith in microbes and molecules , mahatmas and pro- toplasm , which form part of the mental outfit of the man of our day .

		Unless these ideas are brought to '' the measure of a man , '' they can - not be wrought into human action .

		If they are so brought , they diverge very widely from the actual facts in nature which they represent .

		Recognition of the hidden but gigantic forces in nature leads men to fear them or to worship them .

		To think of them , either in fear or wor - ship , is to give them human forms .

		To grant them the form of man is to give them '' a local habitation and a name , '' and in every age and in every race men have been chosen and set apart as representatives of these forces .

		In every nation there are men who are commis - sioned to speak in the name of each god that is worshipped or each demon that the people dread .

		The existence of each cult of priests is bound up in the perpetuation of the mysteries and traditions they visibly represent .

		These tradi - tions are associated with other traditions of other powers , with other conventional explana - tions of uncomprehended phenomena .

		While human theories of the earth , the stars and the clouds , of earthquakes , storms , comets , and disease , have no direct relation to the feeling of worship , yet of necessity they become entangled with it .

		History shows that the human mind can not separate one set of traditional preju - dices from another .

		We come to attach sacredness to the ideas acquired in our youth , whether derived from our own experience or the teachings of our fathers .

		Against this feeling , new ideas , what - ever the nature of their source , must struggle for acceptance .

		Much that we call our religion to-day is simply the debris of our grandfathers ' science .

		To this debris we cling with special persistence .

		We would save the little that is left of the mental universe we built around us in our youth .

		It is the work of science to find the real na - ture of the universe .

		Its function is to elim - inate , as far as may be , the human equation in every statement .

		By methods of precision of thought and instruments of precision of obser - vation it seeks to make our knowledge of the small , the distant , the invisible , the mysterious , as accurate as our knowledge of the common things with which man has dealt for ages .

		It seeks to make our knowledge of common things accurate and precise , that this accuracy and precision may be translated into action .

		For the ultimate end of science , as well as its ini - tial impulse , is the regulation of human con - duct .

		Seeing true means thinking right .

		Right thinking means right action .

		To bring about right action is the end of science .

		Greater pre - cision of thought and action makes higher civi - lization possible .

		Lack of precision in action is the great cause of human misery , for misery is Nature 's protest against the results of wrong conduct .

		The message of science to man is expressed in
Huxley	LOCATION	's words : '' There can be no alleviation of the woes of mankind except in absolute veracity of thought and action and the absolute facing of the world as it is . '' ''

		The world as it is '' is the province of science .

		As the '' world as it is , '' to the sane man , is glori - ous , beautiful , noble , and divine , so will science be the inspiration of art , poetry , and religion .

		The intellectual growth of man has been one long struggle between the ideas of the universe derived directly from realities and the ideas derived from tradition and suggestion .

		The record of this struggle is the most valuable part of history .

		It is the culmination of evolution .

		In his notable record of this struggle , Dr.
John W. Draper	PERSON	has called it '' The Conflict between Science and Religion . ''

		But the inadequacy of this definition has been generally recognized .

		Any feeling , condition , or aspiration , worthy the name of religion , must be individual and not collective .

		Religion can have no such interest in such a struggle , other than this : the triumph of truth breaks the shackles of the individual mind .

		In free minds religion finds her natural abode .

		President White calls it '' the struggle be - tween Science and Dogmatic Theology , ... the conflict between two epochs in the evolu - tion of human thought the theological and the scientific . ''

		This idea was years ago crys - tallized by him in these memorable words : '' In all modern history , interference with science in the supposed interest of religion , no matter how con - scientious such interference may have been , has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science , and invariably ; and , on the other hand , all untrammelled scientific investigation , no matter how dangerous to re - ligion some of its stages may have seemed for the time 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, to be , has invariably resulted in the highest good both of religion and of science . ''

		From the standpoint of history , this struggle has actually been between organized theology and unorganized science .

		Preconceived notions of theological science became entangled with crude notions of all other sciences .

		In the experience of a single human life there is little to correct even the crudest theology .

		From the supposed greater importance of theology in de - termining the fate of the individual man , theo - logical conceptions have dominated all others .

		Throughout the ages the great churches have been the stronghold of conservatism ; religious bodies have formed the great organized army against which the separated bands of science hurled themselves apparently in vain .

		But it seems to me that the real essence of conservatism lies not in theology .

		The whole conflict is a struggle in the mind of man .

		It exists in human pyschology before it is wrought out in human history .

		It is the struggle of realities against tradition and suggestion .

		The progress of civilization would still have been just such a struggle , had religion or theology or churches or worship never existed .

		Intol - erance and prejudice are not confined to relig - ious organizations .

		The same spirit that burned Servetus and
Giordano Bruno	PERSON	, led the atheist * ' liberal '' mob of
Paris	LOCATION	to send to the scaffold the great chemist Lavoisier , '' with the sneer that the republic has no need of savants . ''

		The same spirit that leads the orthodox
Gladstone	PERSON	to reject natural selection because it '' relieves God of the labor of Creation , '' causes the heretic Hseckel to condemn
Weismann	PERSON	's theories of heredity because such questions are settled once for all by the great philosophic dictum of Monism .

		Of President White 's monumental work on '' The Warfare of Science with Theology , '' we have only words of praise .

		In the two ample volumes before us , he has treated almost every phase of this great struggle .

		So far as we can see , he has everywhere written in a spirit of perfect fairness .

		His pages are filled with a wealth of quotations that would tell for them - selves the story of the '' Warfare of Science , '' even if the author had not added a word of his own .

		And these quotations are reinforced by the fullest references to authorities , which will guide students to the original documents used by the author .

		With all this , President White is a master of English prose .

		His style is stately and lucid , rising at times to noble elo - quence .

		It is nowhere dull , or obscure , or undignified .

		His work is one of the great works of our century .

		It should find a place at every scholar 's desk , in every library , in the mind of every thinking man .

		Religious men will be led to avoid the mistakes of intolerance by a knowl - edge of the dire evils to which intolerance has O led in the past .

		Scientific men will be spurred to better work by the record that through all the ages ideas have been tested by their rela - tion to realities .

		Only that which is true sur - vives .

		All men will be more sane and more effective in proportion as they realize that no good can come from '' wishing to please God with a lie . ''

		This work deals mainly with the struggle of dogmatism to limit knowledge .

		But another phase of the same struggle is the desire of or - ganized conservatism to limit action .

		Just as science goes over into action , so does dogma - tism pass over into suppression .

		The struggle for democracy , the rise of the common man , is therefore part of the same great conflict .

		One phase of this struggle , in some regards the most important of all , is the movement towards secularization of education .

		This is the most important because in the schools of to-day the history of to-morrow is already writ - ten .

		In the long run , educational reforms are the most important of all reforms .

		In the preface to these volumes , President White gives us a modest glimpse at the great achievement of his own life , his struggles for the rescue of
Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	from the grasp of medievalism and of secta - rianism .

		Among the basal ideas in the estab - lishment of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	was this , as formulated by President White himself : '' We had especially determined that the institution should be under the control of no political party and of no single religious sect . ''

		The single - ness of purpose of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, its devo - tion wholly to its work of the investigation and dissemination of truth , with '' no other mark or brand upon it , '' stirred up the bigots in all sects alike .

		It was the persistent attacks of belated theologians and philosophers which first led Mr.
White	PERSON	to investigate the records of the '' warfare of science '' in the past .

		The for - gotten obscurantists of twenty-five years ago did not live in vain .

		It is to them that we are indebted for the volumes before us , presented as an offering of honor to
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, by her first President , at the
end of her first quarter-century	DATE	of growth .

		THE DIAL 149 `` THE RENASCENCE OF THE ENGLISH DRAMA . ''

		* A good deal that is harsh has been said of the English drama of the present day , and a good deal of eulogy has been poured out upon contemporary dramatists of other countries .

		In each case a good deal has been said that is ill-considered , and a good deal that is well - deserved .

		One could hardly ask for a better chance to form a judgment than is offered by the recent publication of a translation of
Suder	PERSON	- mann 's '' Heimat , '' and of ''
Michael	PERSON	and his Lost Angel '' by
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	.

		Both authors are well known , both plays are consid - ered excellent examples of their work ; and , fur - ther , the plays are not so very difficult of com - parison , for both are tragedies of domestic life .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	is , I understand , one of the first of contemporary English playwrights .

		He has written a number of successful plays , and has published some of them ; he has written on the drama for the reviews , and has , indeed , pub - lished a good deal in one way or another , with the idea of giving dramatic matters the right turn ; he may very well be taken as represent - ative of actual tendencies in English play - writing .

		He is certainly and sincerely desirous of doing good work , work that shall make the current English drama really worthy of its past .

		This particular play , ''
Michael	PERSON	and his Lost Angel , '' it is true , was not successful on the stage .

		It ran only ten nights at the
Lyceum	LOCATION	, and although the takings were about X1500 , as Mr.
Jones	PERSON	informs us , it seems to have been regarded as a failure and rather suddenly with - drawn .

		But Mr.
Joseph Knight	PERSON	, who contri - butes an introduction to the play , thinks it a fine piece of work in many respects a tri - umph , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's masterpiece , the best play he has given the stage .

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	believes that '' in some respects the loves of
Michael Feversham	PERSON	and
Audrie Lesden	PERSON	seem to take rank with the masterpieces of human passion , if not with
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, with Cupid and Psyche , with
Paul	PERSON	and

Lucy Ash	PERSON	- ton , at least with
Helen	PERSON	and
Paris	LOCATION	,
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra , and
Manon Lescaut	PERSON	and the

		is one of the best-known of the Tudor dramat - ists ; but , whatever his knowledge of literature , Mr.
Knight	PERSON	has evidently read Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's plays which is more than some of us have ione , and we shall not run into error by tak - ing this play as a fair representative of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's work and of the '' renascent '' English drama of our time .

		What , then , is this play ?

		Our readers may be surprised to learn that they can obtain an excellent idea of it from the first act alone .

		The Reverend
Michael Feversham	PERSON	, about forty , with a pale , strong , calm , ascetic , scholarly face , and other proper accompaniments , has discov - ered that one of his parishioners has been se - duced .

		He forces her to make a public con - fession in church , and sends her to a sisterhood in
London	LOCATION	.

		Another of his parishioners , a recent one , is a rich , worldly , presumable widow , whom the clergyman dislikes because he thinks her frivolous and insincere , although she has been fascinated by his book , '' The Hidden Life , '' and contributes largely to his effort to restore the minster .

		Could we have better materials for a stagy and conventional adaptation of '' The Scarlet Letter '' ?

		When
Hawthorne	PERSON	handled this idea , he handled it with a very different view and in a very different way ; and by narrating merely the expiation and not the guilt , and that even under the influence of a powerfully moulding moral force , succeeded in developing a painful but splendid climax .

		But Mr.
Jones	PERSON	would seem to have no moral force ; and , on the other hand , he has the very modern interest in temp - tation .

		He therefore presents to us his ascetic converted by propitious circumstances into an animal , and then reconverted into the ascetic , who , although he acts galvanically in the old ways , always remembers with regret the fierce - ness of the one moment of evil .

		He offers his pair of lovers an opportunity in which even Mr.
Knight	PERSON	thinks
Michael	PERSON	might have be - haved with more delicacy , and so puts one in quite the humor to enjoy the subsequent fool - ing about in the chancel of the rebuilt min - ster , the open confession of the clergyman , the final death of the lady , and the immediately consequent reception of the gentleman into the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the kind of thing that has been considered the masterpiece of one of the first playwrights of a great dramatic era .

		Of
Sudermann	ORGANIZATION	's `` Heimat '' we need not speak at length ; many of our readers will have seen it on the stage , or read it in the original .

		Those who have not the German at hand will 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, find in this translation a good substitute .

		Whether it be or be not
Sudermann	PERSON	's master - piece , it has his strong points , and has been received in
Germany	LOCATION	with an attention that is as creditable to the German audiences as the disfavor shown to ''
Michael	PERSON	and his Lost An - gel '' is creditable to the audiences of
London	LOCATION	.

		We have all heard , at least , of the Prodigal Son ; and we may have known prodigal sons ourselves , for certainly the tale is not an old - fashioned one .

		But there is this turn which it may take : suppose the Prodigal do not squan - der his heritage and become a pig-keeper ; sup - pose , instead , he works hard , achieves success , and becomes great and honored .

		What chance , then , has the simplicity , the honor , the small narrowness of Home in comparison with the freedom of individuality and the ever-changing splendor of worldly success ?

		This play of
Sudermann	ORGANIZATION	's presents to us the conventional , bigoted , cramped life of a little German town , and the return home of a successful , glorious singer , who was born there .

		The point is focus for unending lines of life : old ideas and young blood , the power of home and the power of the world , duty and freedom , conventionality and individualism , here a great dramatist will find freedom of movement .

		So , in such a sit - uation Sudermann places his characters and produces a real tragedy , something which we read to the end and then put away with a sub - dued feeling of relief .

		Character , humor , pa - thos , the drama has ; but , chief of all , that classic quality , the power of chilling and calm - ing the moral temper by the pity and awe called up by the imagination of the playwright .

		All this does not seem to give a complete account of this play .

		It would be more fitting , perhaps , in a critical journal , to comment on the strength of the character-drawing , the fine - ness of the humor , or to compare Sudermann with
Ibsen	PERSON	on the one hand or Echegaray on the other .

		These things must be left to the several readers ; the main point here is to note the difference between the English drama of our own day , and well , any other drama where there are really strong men at work .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	is undoubtedly well-meaning ; no one who reads his non-dramatic work will doubt that he desires earnestly that the English drama should be a real field for a man of genius .

		It is only when one comes to read one of his plays that one begins to doubt ; or , if not to doubt his intention , at least to see that good intentions only do not make great works of art .

		EDWARD
E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		AMERICAN The peculiar features of American money , as seen by the European traveller , are the dirty dollar bills and the bronze pennies ; while in the mind of the average American the prominent fact , probably , is the existence of national banks which enjoy the monopoly of the right to issue notes for circulation '' as money . ''

		Yet neither of these characteristics is in any way fundamental : they play no important part in the discussion of a '' sound '' or an '' honest '' monetary system .

		The soiled bills could easily be withdrawn from circulation , and public health , as well as morals and aesthetics , would be greatly im - proved ; all that is necessary is that the government should keep the post-offices of the country supplied with freshly-printed notes , and authorize them to forward worn and torn bills to the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	depart - ment by mail : the cost would be trifling .

		Our cur - rency would not be changed in principle , but im - proved in practice , if pennies were made of alum - inum , or of some metalic mixture other than bronze ; they are manufactured for sale just as any other commodity is , except that a government monopoly has been established , like that of tobacco and cigars , or matches , in several European governments .

		Finally , the national bank-notes are secured by gov - ernment bonds deposited with the Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, so that they are in reality government paper currency and not bank currency : their value depends in no way upon the continued solvency of the bank which issued them ; for , whether the bank fail or not , they are redeemed by the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	de - partment through the sale of the bonds deposited for them when the individual bank began business .

		The real reform of American currency involves other considerations than these which appear on the surface .

		Unfortunately , the problem is an exceedingly complicated one .

		Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	, in his work on `` Con - gressional Currency , '' is not far wrong when he characterizes our national currency as the inconse - quential , incongruous , and unscientific result of ex - travagant and hazardous legislative experiments , a jumble of incoherent and uncorrelated acts of * CONGRESSIONAL CURRENCY .

		THE
DIAL Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a Congressional currency , with many anomalous and unique features .

		The question at issue in the present campaign is consequently not a clearly defined and simple one .

		Even if we limit our consideration to the question of the free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one , the situation is far from plain ; there are at least four separate problems involved , of industrial history , of eco - nomic theory , of ethical principle , and of political policy ; namely : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Has the price of gold risen appreciably in recent years , either from industrial or legislative influences ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Is it possible to maintain a permanent ratio of exchange between two commodities , like gold and silver , under conditions of free production ?

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Will the right to have 371 ^ grains of silver coined in the same way that multiples of 23.22 grains of gold are now coined at the mint , insure an honest dollar ?

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Is it wise for the
United States	LOCATION	alone to undertake the free coinage of these metals at the ratio of sixteen to one ?

		There seems to be room for honest differences of opinion on each of these questions ; but they do not by any means exhaust the problems involved in the money question and in a revision of the system of American currency .

		On the one hand , the private control of gold by the international syndicates that are so easily formed has driven various governments , as well as our own , to undertake the issue business as well as the deposit business of banks .

		On the other hand , the failure of our government in the last thirty years to provide a paper currency of suitable proportions to accommodate business men in their ordinary commercial transactions has led to the use of private or personal money in the shape of certified checks , drafts , bills of exchange , clear - ing-house certificates , etc. .

		Two questions thus stand opposed one to another : Shall the government go out of the banking business ?

		or , shall the ten per cent tax on circulation other than that of national banks be abolished , and a system of bank currency made possible ?

		In the confused state of the currency , as well as the still more confused condition of the public mind upon the nature , origin , and function of money in general and the reform of American currency in particular , we are doubly indebted for such a clear and simple , straightforward statement of the exist - ing facts as Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	gives in his '' Congressional Currency , '' and for such a rational , fair-minded , and scholarly defense of the proposed plan for re - form as President
Walker	PERSON	offers in his ''
Interna	PERSON	- tional Bimetallism . ''

		Each of these little books should be issued in an inexpensive form and dis - tributed as a campaign document in this campaign of education , for they throw light on both national and international politics , as well as on the disputed questions of monetary science .

		Three things are essential to any radical improve - ment of the currency : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A logical criticism of what is ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- broad philosophical grounds for what should be ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a practical programme for passing from the present good to the future better .

		Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	's criticism is political rather than economic , and is along the line of attack suggested in Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's '' Congressional Government '' on the one hand , and of Professor
Kinley	PERSON	's '' Independent Treasury of the
United States	LOCATION	'' on the other .

		By way of resume , the au - thor quotes a statement from the latter work to the effect that in addition to the duties for which the independent treasury was organized , of receiving and disbursing the money of the government , it now discharges the functions , first , of a bank of issue , with the usual reserve ; second , of a bank of deposit , general and special ; third , of a redemption agent for the national banks as well as the government ; fourth , of a transfer agent for carrying money to different parts of the country , either free of charge or at lower rates than is charged by banks ; and lastly , of a silver bullion broker , from
July 14 , 1890	DATE	, to
November 1 , 1893	DATE	.

		Against all this increase of Congressional activity , Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	strongly inveighs , and pleads for the return to our system of fifty years ago , when '' the heavy and unsteady hand '' of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was withdrawn from the absolute control of currency .

		Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's elaborate '' History of Modern Banks of Issue '' may be regarded as in a sense sup - plementary to the short essay of Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	.

		It shows us the way in which Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	's hope may be realized , and the government can fulfil all its protective duties and still let the money market take care of itself .

		The purpose of his book is to set forth the principles and uses of a banking currency the essential feature of which is the circulation of notes payable to bearer and redeemable in coin , but only partly covered by a coin reserve .

		To show how this result may be accomplished , he gives a detailed history of the leading banks of issue in the world and an account of their methods of doing business .

		The failures and experiments of the last hundred years have brought the bank of issue into a practi - cable and easily workable system .

		It only remains for the law to enforce the lessons learned in that period , and remove the confusion that has arisen in the public mind and separated bank notes from other forms of credit , other evidences of debt , which differ from them only in degree of negotiability . ''

		A bank of issue simply takes the titles to capital which have been transferred to its custody and loans them to its customers in the form of negotiable paper -LRB- page 10 -RRB- .

		Its business is simply to transform the bill of exchange , which is itself a negotiable security , into another sort of negotiable security .

		In promising to pay at sight , the difficulty is avoided of maturity at a fixed term and the bearer is relieved of the limitations which result from it .

		By the promise to pay to bearer , one gets rid of the embarrassment of endorsements , pro- tests , recourse , etc. .

		One obtains by this means a secur - ity always negotiable '' -LRB- page 5 -RRB- .

		No new capital is created , but the mobility of that 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, which exists is greatly increased .

		When a note is discounted at the bank , the officers are not lending the merchant their money , but are buying from him a debt due to him . ''

		In individual cases , the creator of a paper credit may obtain the use of more capital than he possesses , but in every such case he simply obtains the use of the capital of some other person or body of persons .

		The bank note simply assists in the movement of capital '' -LRB- page 9 -RRB- .

		The common argument against the issue of paper money is that it paves the way for panic and indus - trial depression , by piling up a vast credit structure on a slender basis of coin , the favorite metaphor being an inverted pyramid , supported in unstable equilibrium upon a golden apex . ''

		A better image than that of the inverted pyramid would be that of the railway or canal , which by a single route permits the happy interchange of all commodities .

		Proper facilities for transportation do not require a car for every carload of wheat which exists , nor a canal broad enough for all vessels to pass abreast .

		The possi - bility of having the car when it is needed , the promise of the use of the canal for a brief time , serve every purpose ; and no one thinks of charging that the trans - portation system is a vast structure of credit resting upon a few real cars or upon abnormally narrow tracks '' -LRB- page 465 -RRB- .

		That modern industry and commerce require paper money is hardly a debatable question .

		Notes of the bank or the government are merely the small-change of commercial transactions .

		A metallic currency of the volume of the money at present in use in the
United States	LOCATION	about
$ 1,600,000,000	MONEY	would cost
$ 45,000,000	MONEY	annually .

		Over ninety per cent of bank exchanges , and probably over eighty per cent of retail trade , even in country districts , is done by paper money and book credits .

		The issue is between private or individual money and a currency regu - lated by law and issued either by the government or the banks .

		The object of Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's book is to '' convince thinking Americans of the axiomatic truth that the currency of a commercial country should be regulated by commercial conditions , and not by the whims of politicians '' The modern use of credit instruments is as great a marvel in its way as the development of the power of steam or elec - tricity ; and , like them , it has its dangers .

		The touchstone of sound banking currency is redemption in standard coin on demand ; but a bank may put too large a portion of its assets into forms which can not be quickly turned into cash loans on doubt - ful paper , or on real estate , or in industrial enter - prises that tie money up for a long period .

		This is no argument against banking currency in itself , but against an abuse of credit in sinking capital in un - productive enterprises and taking speculative risks .

		The true business of banking consists in dealing in short-time commercial paper .

		A bank-note thus represents the value of commodities that are in pro- cess of .

		production and exchange .

		It becomes what
Adam Smith	PERSON	called a wagon-way through the air .

		But '' governments seldom resort to the issue of paper money until their lack of credit impairs their other resources '' -LRB- page 572 -RRB- .

		Fiat money thus not only does not represent wealth , but it can not be readily exchanged for wealth .

		It is a wagon-way through the air , which has connection with the clouds and not with the earth . ''

		Governments have no quick assets .

		The advocates of government paper money are fond of declaring that a national currency is based on the aggregate wealth and credit of the entire nation .

		But they miss the purpose of currency and banks of issue .

		It is not wealth in the abstract which currency must represent , but quickly negotiable wealth ... Custom houses and highways , npld guns and ironclads , are not the sort of assets which can be quickly marketed or put in pawn to borrow money , and the power of taxation is even less efficient as secur - ity for a banking business .

		It is in the nature of an assessment upon the stockholders , which is a worthless resource during solvency and is resorted to only for liquidation after suspension of payments -LRB- page 574 -RRB- .

		The state is not a money lender nor a receiver of de - posits payable on demand '' -LRB- page 566 -RRB- .

		Moreover , the volume of a government paper cur - rency always tends to conform to the needs of the government itself ; but a banking currency arises out of the needs of commerce , and tends to adapt itself to the necessities of trade , foreign as well as domestic .

		A slight redundancy of the currency leads merchants and bankers to send home notes for redemption .

		When redeemed , they are not re - issued ; whereas , a law of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	requires that the government shall pay out legal tenders again as soon as they have been presented and exchanged for gold .

		The bank , by raising the rate of discount , holds money in the country and prevents its being sunk in doubtful industry .

		A banking currency is thus the hand-maid of commerce , as it should be , and not the instrument of political power .

		Another , and for Americans perhaps the most important , advantage of a banking currency , is the fact that it paves the way for deposit banking and promotes the banking facilities and the use of credit instruments in the community .

		The poverty of this means of carrying on business is a striking fea - ture of many parts of the
South and West	LOCATION	.

		The remedy lies , not in the free coinage of silver , but in a system of banking that shall be supervised by the national government , and will secure uniformity and constant convertibility of bank-notes into coin , but shall also afford the banking facilities which a government paper money is powerless to offer .

		Mr.
Conant	PERSON	of course assumes that there is a standard money of redemption , and says that it is of prime importance that there should be a fixed metallic standard of value .

		Since
1834	DATE	this stand - ard has been 23.22 grains of fine gold ; but Mr.
Del Mar	PERSON	, in his '' Science of Money , '' maintains that it has not been and can not be '' fixed '' so long as private coinage is allowed and the money-changers are thus able to determine the number of coins that shall be issued and put in circulation in the world 's currency .

		The policy is both senseless and mis - chievous ; one more so was never procured -LRB- page x. -RRB- .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 153 Mr. Del Mar urges that money is a mechanism designed to measure value with precision , and that the unit of money is all money ; that the efficiency of all measures , money included , depends upon the exactness of their limits ; that the limitation of the supply of money was anciently a prerogative of the state , and that it should be so again . ''

		The essential point is not what the coins are made of , nor what the notes promise , but how many of them there are , and what assurance there is that this number will remain constant -LRB- page 47 -RRB- .

		The important matter is that gold has been ' cornered ' ; that commerce trem - bles when a million of yellow pieces are shipped abroad ; and that your present monetary policy is pinning down the future to wholly impossible and ruinous conditions , opposed to prosperity and fatal to liberty '' -LRB- page 56 -RRB- .

		The author presents much that is interesting but hardly scientific , and offers but a scant page and a half out of two hundred pages to a consideration of the grave difficulties as to the manner in which we are to determine how the '' sum of money may best be regulated . ''

		He deems it necessary to business prosperity that this be left to '' the representatives of the people , whose patriotism , conservatism , and societary instinct furnish a far more reliable basis for the stability of money , than the doctrines , the prejudices , or the selfishness of the new plutocracy '' -LRB- page 84 -RRB- .

		The value of the dollar of account certainly ought not to depend upon an accidental majority ; but to say , on the other hand , that it should represent invariably a certain weight and fineness of the pre - cious metals , is putting the cart before the horse : it is the metal which represents the dollar .

		The purpose is to find something which shall invariably represent the mental estimate which is our unit of value .

		Shall this be a particular amount of gold , or silver , or both ?

		President
Walker	PERSON	, in his '' Inter - national Bimetallism , '' suggests : '' It can not be considered unfair to call the attention of those who have been fond of speaking of silver as something that may become too cheap for the principal monetary uses of civilized and progressive nations , to the fact that , within our own time , the continued monetary use of gold was seriously endangered by its cheapness ; and that it was silver which enjoyed the preference '' -LRB- page 137 -RRB- .

		The real question is not whether silver is more stable in value than gold , or gold than silver , and as to which of them should therefore be chosen to represent the unit of value ; but whether the free coinage of both metals at a given ratio as to the weight of coins will not so affect the demand for either at different times as to keep the price from fluctuating beyond an appreciable limit which would be economically so small as to prevent either from driving the other out of use as money , and thus se - cure a more stable representative of the unit of value . ''

		The only question that can possibly arise is as to the degree of the effect prodviced .

		On this point , diver - gence is to be expected and to be tolerated ... Men will take positions on the subject according to their pre - dilections , according to the amount of their information , according to their temperament and habit of mind .

		This is simply to say that the question of bimetallism , like the question of protection , and , indeed , like most other questions in economics , is purely a question of degree .

		The quality of the effect is conceded .

		The quantity of the effect is in dispute '' -LRB- page 97 -RRB- .

		President
Walker	PERSON	's opinion is that '' the efforts made by this country , for itself alone , to rehabilitate sil - ver are prejudicial to our own national interests and to the cause of true international bimetallism '' -LRB- page iv . -RRB-

		.

		He is a bimetallist of the international type , believing that , '' Should international bimetallism ever be estab - lished , it will be through diplomatic negotiations quietly conducted , without speech-making or ceremony , between the four nations ,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, any three of which can , at any time , bring about the result .

		If those four nations , or any three of them , shall ever agree to act together in this matter , the programme thus formed would secure the immediate and unquestioning assent of a sufficient number of the less important states to carry it to a triumphant issue ' * -LRB- page 230 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Walker	PERSON	does not state what he thinks this pro- gramme should be , declining to discuss the question of the actual ratio to be taken in any attempt to restore international bimetallism .

		AH talk about the existing ratio of thirty to one , however , he regards as silly , as the present condition of the market is the necessary result of the demonetization of silver by the various countries of
Europe	LOCATION	in the period from
1871	DATE	to
1879	DATE	.

		What the ratio would have to be under a remonetization of silver , in order to maintain '' a real and reasonably permanent bimetallism '' -LRB- page 65 -RRB- can only be determined properly and logically when the question is settled whether a strong and serious effort shall be made to reestablish international bimetallism .

		His de - fense of the general principle is based primarily on the testimony of history , and secondarily on the theories of economic science .

		Beginning with the enormous production of the precious metals by slave labor in early times , when everything belonged to the princes and the metals were distributed by war and not by trade , the story is told in succeeding chapters -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the waste of gold and silver from the time of Augustus to that of
Columbus	LOCATION	; -LRB- 2 -RRB- of '' the period of tumultuous , overwhelming , revolutionary inflation '' that followed the discoveries in
Mexico	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	, when silver fell from a ratio of eleven to one of gold to a ratio of fifteen to one ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- of bimetallism in
England	LOCATION	,
1666	DATE	to
1816	DATE	; -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the increasing demand for gold early in this century , and its enormous production after
1848	DATE	, when only the barrier of bimetallism in
France	LOCATION	prevented gold from falling , '' in a succession of plunges , from crag to crag , down to a level which would mean nothing less than universal bankruptcy '' -LRB- page 123 -RRB- ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the impossibility of making a fair trial of bimetal - lism in this country prior to
1873	DATE	; -LRB- 6 -RRB- of demon - etization ; and -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the great debate , in the series of international monetary conferences .

		From begin - ning to end , the story is told in an eminently fair - 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	> minded way , with the light touches of a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	lecture-course which will entertain as well as instruct an audience , and in the scholarly style of a master who has heard all the opponents have to offer , and finds it wanting when subjected to rational criti - cism .

		His argument from economic theory , unfor - tunately , is not calculated to convince the mono - metallist , so much of the matter in controversy is assumed in each case argued , under the phraseology of '' other things being equal . ''

		The trouble lies in the fact , to which Mr.
Walker	PERSON	frequently refers in the historical outline given , that other things are very likely not to be equal .

		When one of the vari - ables in an economic problem is changed , one or more of the others will probably change also .

		Mr.
McPherson	PERSON	, in treating '' The Monetary and Banking Problem , '' does not condescend to argue the case .

		He simply quotes Mr.
W. A. Shaw	PERSON	to the effect that the bimetallic idea '' is not borne out by a single instance in history '' -LRB- page 71 -RRB- , and goes on to show what a poor unit of value gold has been . ''

		A debt of one hundred dollars incurred twenty-five years ago , if paid to-day in gold , would inure to the creditor double the amount of benefit that the borrower obtained at the time the debt was incurred ; because prices , measured by the gold standard , of nearly all the staple products clothing , shoes , furniture , grain , nails , tools , watches , drugs , glass , carpets have in the last generation fallen in about the same degree that the price of silver has fallen '' -LRB- page 84 -RRB- .

		In the future , he insists , gold will be even less fitted to serve as a standard of value which may measure justice to all and injustice to none , in measuring and rewarding human effort , and that the medium of exchange and measure of value should be based directly upon the results of human effort .

		He admits that this is an ideal standard which can only be attained through slow and painful development , but believes that the increasing use of paper representa - tives of commodities in general and property of all kinds , which form the real basis of bank currency , tends to develope an ultimate standard independent of both coin and bullion , gold or silver , which con - sists of a unit of force or human energy .

		He urges that it is high time that we should dethrone Money from the pedestal of vain mythological meaning , and learn that money is but the hand-maid of human effort .

		The first step toward the ideal standard lies in an improvement of our lax and disjointed banking system , by which shrewd , plausible , and unscrupulous men can put the whole system of indus - try in a hazardous condition by a little juggling with exchanged notes discounted at separate and officially separated banks .

		The successful features of Scotch and Canadian banking , if incorporated into the American system , would tend directly toward that fluctuating supply of currency which is the requisite of progressive industry .

		Under our present system , the question of money is as inextricably bound up with the subject of taxa - tion on the one hand as it is with banking on the other .

		The question of '' honest '' money has to do with the value of the unit chosen to represent the dollar .

		It is fixed by law , and varies by reason of changes in natural conditions affecting the supply of the metal chosen , or by reason of changes in industrial and commercial conditions affecting demand . ''

		Sound '' money has reference only to the certainty of re - demption in coin of the promises to pay dollars .

		During the Civil War the government of the
United States	LOCATION	issued some hundreds of millions of promises to pay on demand , without interest , and made these notes legal tender .

		Their redemption was stopped by law in
1868	DATE	, and nearly
$ 350,000,000	MONEY	remains to be paid .

		Under the law of
1890	DATE	, which was re - pealed
November 1 , 1893	DATE	, the government bought about 150,000,000 ounces of silver , and paid for it in treasury notes which promise to pay '' coin '' on demand .

		This silver , and such gold as is not held to redeem the gold certificates outstanding , is kept in the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	as a reserve to pay these notes when presented .

		They do not differ in character from any other promissory notes , and , like all other notes , are presented whenever there arises a reasonable doubt of the ability of the issuer to pay on demand .

		This , in the case of the government , is whenever taxes fail to yield the amount necessary to meet current expenses .

		Aside from all other disturb - ances , that has been the situation of the
United States	LOCATION	government for the last three years .

		It is this critical condition of the national finances which makes Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's excellent account of '' Taxation and Taxes in the
United States	LOCATION	under the Internal Revenue System '' peculiarly timely .

		The experi - ences he records '' indicate most clearly how almost inexhaustible are the sources of taxation as yet un - touched , of which the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	may avail itself in case of need , and show an array of unused taxes and unopened resources unparalleled in contemporary budgetary history '' -LRB- page v. -RRB- .

		He shows that inter - nal taxes should never be wholly relinquished , but '' that in time of peace the machinery for immedi - ately realizing upon the currently created wealth of the country should never be permitted to get out of running order '' -LRB- page 70 -RRB- ; that '' with the pos - sible exception of the taxes on distilled and fer - mented liquors , there are probably no subjects bet - ter fitted for taxation by the Federal government than certain corporations whose business is of an inter-state character '' -LRB- pages 102-103 -RRB- , the tax being levied on the gross receipts of the transporta - tion company ; that taxes on the assessed valuation of property are especially objectionable in a federal system , '' indefinite in their productivity and inelas - tic in character , ... combining almost all the de - fects of the excise with those of the income and direct land tax '' -LRB- page 111 -RRB- ; that the income tax stands as a sort of equalizer to such taxes as those on liquors and tobacco , which are in effect exagger - ated poll taxes -LRB- page 238 -RRB- ; and that time is a most essential requisite to efficiency in an excise system ; and '' that a moderate rate of taxation will in the long run prove more productive , and less prejudi - cial to the moral , social , and industrial interests of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 a nation , than one so excessive in amount as to en - courage evasion , speculation , and fraud '' -LRB- page 81 -RRB- . ''

		Experience has demonstrated that the best fiscal policy always advises that taxation should be so devised as to allow the largest possible freedom to the individ - ual and the greatest liberty to industry , and that this is best attained by a concentration of the excise upon the smallest number of objects consistent with efficiency of administration '' -LRB- page 229 -RRB- .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	, in a volume of collected `` Essays on Taxation , '' presents both the history and the theory of taxation , particularly that of cor - porations .

		The inheritance tax , he says , scarcely needs defence to-day : but he holds that the single tax is defective fiscally , politically , morally , and economically ; he refuses to discuss it as a scheme for introducing the social millennium .

		He condemns the general property tax from the triple standpoint of history , theory , and practice , and believes it , as actually administered , to be beyond all doubt one of the worst taxes known in the civilized world . ''

		Because of its attempt to tax intangible as well as tangible things , it sins against the cardinal rules of uni - formity , of equality , and of universality of taxation .

		It puts a premium on dishonesty and debauches the public conscience ; it reduces deception to a system , and makes a science of knavery ; it presses hardest on those least able to pay ; it imposes double taxation on one man , and grants entire immunity to the next .

		In short , the gen - eral property tax is so flagrantly inequitable , that its retention can be explained only through ignorance or inertia .

		It is the cause of such crying injustice that its alteration or its abolition must become the battle-cry of every statesman and reformer '' -LRB- page 61 -RRB- .

		From the brief survey of the development of taxa - tion with which Professor
Seligman	PERSON	's volume opens , however , one fact stands out prominently , `` the slow and laborious growth of standards of justice in taxation , and the attempt on the part of the com - munity as a whole to realize this justice . ''

		We are endeavoring to put into practice the principle that each individual should be held to help the state in proportion to his ability to help himself .

		It may be doubted whether this will long remain our concep - tion of justice .

BURNHAM WOODFORD	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Curiotities of the
Miltonian Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Orchard	PERSON	's `` Astronomy of Mil - ton 's Paradise Lost '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is in some respects a disappointing book .

		The title itself is almost a misnomer , since more than half of the 338 pages that make up the book are devoted to historical and descriptive as - tronomy , and are only distantly related to the author 's real subject .

		There are also many trifling inaccuracies of expression ; some of these the au - thor could doubtless explain away , because they are in the main of no great importance , but the fre - quency with which they occur disturbs one 's con - fidence in the accuracy of the author 's scholarship .

		Here are two examples : on page 165 , the method by parallax is alluded to as '' a method called -LRB- Par - allax ' '' ; on page 34 the word '' observation , '' used in connection with the labors of
Kepler	PERSON	, might give the reader a wrong notion of what
Kepler	PERSON	really did for astronomy .

		On page 102 ,
Milton	PERSON	's '' to save ap - pearances '' is quoted and used in just the same way as one would use the modern idiom , without a sug - gestion of the technical meaning which the phrase in this instance has .

		On page 165 , the author accepts
Proctor	PERSON	's statement that the diameter of the earth 's orbit is 183 millions of miles , whereas it has been shown to be nearly 186 millions of miles .

		In many cases
Milton	PERSON	's allusions are only partially explained ; these slips are sometimes the result of carelessness as when it is stated , on page 149 , that '' The Sun is in the constellation Taurus in
April	DATE	, '' a statement that is correct as far as it goes , but as often the result of a lack of knowledge , as when it is stated that
Milton	PERSON	's allusion to '' other suns '' is a refer - ence to
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	and
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this instance a knowledge of
Verity	ORGANIZATION	's very plausible explanation would have bound the author to a fair discussion of the two interpretations , even though he were still to retain his present explanation .

		In dealing with the discussion which takes place between
Adam	PERSON	and the
Angel	LOCATION	, in Book VIII. , Mr.
Orchard	PERSON	is neither as clear nor as precise as might be desired .

		We are by no means sure that we may '' regard the views expressed by
Adam	PERSON	as representing
Milton	PERSON	's own opinions '' ; at any rate , it is hardly correct to say , with Mr.
Orchard	PERSON	, that the views expressed by Adam '' were in conformity with the Copernican theory , '' or , with Mr.
Masson	PERSON	, that ''
Adam	PERSON	is represented as arriving by intuition at the Copernican theory . ''

		Putting aside our anxiety to prove that
Milton	PERSON	inclined toward the Copernican theory , the lines are simply an expression of
Adam	PERSON	's doubt in the truth of the Ptolemaic theory ; they are neither '' in con - formity with , '' nor do they represent
Adam	PERSON	as `` ar - riving by intuition at , '' the Copernican theory .

		Mil - ton , like many men of his time , although familiar with the arguments presented in favor of the Co - pernican theory , accepted the Ptolemaic theory , not merely for poetical purposes , as
Masson	PERSON	suggests , because the former theory would have suited these purposes quite as well as the latter , but because he was conservative enough to prefer a theory in the knowledge of which he had been versed from his childhood .

		The truth of this theory he at times doubted , but there is nothing in the '' Paradise Lost '' to indicate that
Milton	PERSON	ever thought the Copernican theory more than a possible alternative .

		On the whole , then , it can not be said that Mr.
Orchard	PERSON	has added anything of importance to our knowledge of
Milton	LOCATION	, while in not a few instances he has failed to use all the material at his command .

		This is to be regretted , because the book is in other respects a well-written and interesting work .

		It needs an index , however , to make it serviceable for reference .

		156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, A relic of yesterday .

		When '' The Yellow Book '' first ap - peared , an article called `` A
Defense of Cosmetics	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Max Beer	PERSON	- bohm , excited rage in some hearts .

		It was regarded as an insult , if not to the intelligence of the whole human race , at least to that part of it which was cog - nizant of '' The Yellow Book . ''

		In the second num - ber Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	explained that such was an unwar - ranted idea ; the article had not been intended as an insult to intelligence , but rather as a travesty upon certain contemporary tendencies .

		Now that the essay is given its due place in the '' Works '' of its gifted author -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , it does not appear to be a trav - esty , unless all of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	's work is to be re - garded as a travesty .

		It is in tone not very differ - ent from the other essays in the book .

		It is not , however , the best of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	's works .

		That proud honor we unhesitatingly award to the review of English Society of sixteen years ago .

		This little essay is a masterpiece , not only of superficial re - search , but of flippant seriousness .

		The reminis - cence of mashers and professional beauties , Mrs.
Langtry	PERSON	and
Connie Gilchrist	PERSON	, the Manola waltz , and sestheticism , is manipulated with a delicacy of satire that is excellent .

		Next in merit is the sketch of '' A Good Prince '' ; although rather an ordinary deception , it is very charming in its developments . ''

		Diminuendo '' is also pleasant , although it has the contemporary curse of autobiography .

		The thor - ough and careful paper on '' Dandies and Dandies '' will give one ideas , even if it do not amuse .

		Less tempting are the article already mentioned and the biographical studies of
George IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- we are happily spared the awful picture which appeared in '' The Yellow Book '' -RRB- and of
Romeo Coates	PERSON	.

		We think that if one will make up his mind not to be insulted by Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	's impertinence , condescension , solemn absurdity , and naive artificialities , he will find this book delightfully funny .

		He may also be instructed ; for Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	is a representative man not representative of the century , or even of the decade , but of the time being , of the instant which , as
Taine	PERSON	says , changes while one is off on a journey .

		In temper he shows the sort of affecta - tion which we have seen in many young men in the last few years .

		In style he gives us the manner - isms of half a dozen contemporaries , from
Walter Pater	PERSON	and Oscar Wilde to Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	and Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	.

		It may be that it is all a conscious travesty ; but it is surely not a very important mat - ter to decide whether it is or not .

		It is amusing , and what more should we ask ?

		The Chautauqua books for the com - New books for fi num b er have just Chaulauquans .

		J ' J been published , and form perhaps the most valuable collection of required reading that has yet been provided for students under the Chau - tauqua system .

		One of the books is Mr.
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	's '' French Traits , '' published in a new edition for this purpose , and too well and favorably known to need any comment .

		To go with this ad - mirably acute study of contemporary French civili - zation , Professor
George B. Adams	PERSON	has been called upon to prepare a treatise on '' The Growth of the
French Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' and has acquitted himself of this difficult task in a highly satisfactory manner .


Greece	LOCATION	joins with
France	LOCATION	in claiming the attention of this year 's circle of Chautauqua readers , for two of the required volumes are '' A Survey of Greek Civili - zation , '' by Professor
J. P. Mahaffy	PERSON	, and '' A His - tory of Greek Art , '' by Professor
F. B. Tarbell	PERSON	.

		Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's work is , of course , both com - petent and interesting , and just such a '' Survey '' as he has written will suit the needs of many read - ers who are not Chautauquans ; but we can not help regretting the rather obtrusive and unpleasant reli - giosity of the preface with which he has seen fit to commend his book to its special American public .

		Professor
Tarbell	PERSON	's book on Greek art has taken advantage of the latest achievements in classical archaeology , and is particularly noteworthy for the judicious selection of its illustrations .

		It '' has been written in the conviction that the greatest of all mo - tives for studying art , the motive which is and ought to be strongest in most people , is the desire to be - come acquainted with beautiful and noble things . ''

		It need hardly be added that the text of this trea - tise displays both grace and accurate scholarship .

		The last of these five books is devoted to popular astronomy , and is called '' A Study of the Sky . ''

		Dr.
Herbert A. Howe	PERSON	, of
Denver	LOCATION	, is the author , and he has made an extremely readable book , avoiding mathematics and technicalities as far as possible without sacrifice of the real objects of such a manual .

		We do not think that the Rev.
F. L. Evolution	PERSON	of Humphrevs 's '' Evolution of Church church music .

		, * A , .

		.

		, Music -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will satisfy any serious reader who desires a reliable history and a plausible theory of religious music , both of which we might suppose would be provided for us .

		The author 's habit of presenting us with quotations , often of some length , from unmentioned authors -LRB- despite his idea that he gives '' due credit '' -RRB- , will not impress his readers favorably , and his discursive way of thinking seems to have prevented him from reach - ing any sound and useful bases for discussion .

		His book , however , will doubtless give desired informa - tion on the subject to not a few ; and if it succeeds also in impressing on the public mind some of its ideas on contemporary church music , it will not have been published in vain .

		For whatever may be the author 's character as a historian or a theorist , he is a musician of cultivated taste and religious feeling .

		For our part , we willingly dispense with many things for the sake of his eminently sane opinions on boy choirs , church quartettes , gospel songs , hymns of silly or wicked wording , opera music slightly disguised or openly borrowed , and other matters which too often make our religious music to-day a sufficient reason for going anywhere on
Sunday	DATE	but to church .

		Nor is his criticism wholly destructive ; the choir leader will find interest also
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 in his positive suggestion .

		In fact , if readers will appreciate what they find , and not be disappointed at not finding what they may be right in expecting , they will be glad to have read the book .

		`` TheMott - ^ r - J'
Fitzgerald Molloy	PERSON	's two - Gorgeous Lady volume life of '' The Most Gorgeous
Blessington	PERSON	. ''

		Lady Blessington '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , a fourth edition of which is now issued , does full justice to her ladyship 's dazzling and rather erratic career .

		The life-story of this daughter of a
Tipperary	LOCATION	squireen , and queen regnant of the fam - ous
Gore House	ORGANIZATION	coterie , has in it all the essentials of a full-blown romance , and it loses nothing in the sympathetic hands of Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	.

		The book teems , of course , with stories and pen-portraits of literary people
Byron	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Disraeli	LOCATION	,
Bulwer	PERSON	,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	, and the rest ; and these elements con - stitute its chief interest for most readers .

		For Lady
Blessington	PERSON	now shines -LRB- despite her one time '' gor - geousness '' and prodigious , if fleeting , literary vogue -RRB- mainly with a borrowed light , and sinks to the rank of those meeker literary luminaries who are remembered for their friendships rather than their performances .

		Yet one would gladly have seen Lady
Blessington	PERSON	in all her glory ; and there is no doubt that she was in life vastly better company , and to all appearances vastly cleverer , than many of her friends who wrote vastly better books .

		Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	's account of her will be found very enter - taining far more so than the average novel .

		It contains a charming portrait , after
Lawrence	PERSON	, of her ladyship , which bears out Dr.
Parr	PERSON	's '' liquorish epithet . ''

		Autobiographical The extrinsic interest that attaches reminiscences of to the personality of celebrities will a musician .

		probably suffice for most people who read the autobiographical reminiscences of
Charles Gounod	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The contents of the book , gathered , beside the autobiographical sketch , from family letters and a few random papers , are duly personal and chatty ; and it is interesting also to note the artistic persuasions of the composer of one of the most popular operas ever written .

		Whether
Faust	PERSON	was
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's own favorite or not , he seems to have judged it , like his other works , dispassion - ately .

		He says nothing , for instance , of the storm of controversy which the score raised in its day among the musical critics .

		That it seemed advanced to them was perhaps because he himself had been trained in so good and catholic a school .

		Palestrina ,
Bach	PERSON	,
Cherubini	LOCATION	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Beethoven	PERSON	were among his early favorites ; he recognized the genius of
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, and says a contemporary good word for Saint-Saens .

		He appears to have had , on the whole , more than most musicians , a definite and intellect - ual notion of what art is .

		His letters from
Italy	LOCATION	show genuine appreciation of its painters and musi - cians , and we find him , later , intelligently defend - ing the
Ecole de Rome	ORGANIZATION	from the attacks of modern naturalism and realism .

		The translation from the French is the work of the Hon.
W. Hely Hutchinson	PERSON	.

		Philosophy The popularity of Professor
Henry	PERSON	and religion
Jones	PERSON	's book on ``
Browning	PERSON	as a Phi - in
Browning	LOCATION	.

		l O8Op hical and Religious Teacher '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is evident from the fact that a third edition is now issued , in less than five years after the publication of the first .

		The method of the book is to marshal numerous passages from the poet , and from them to deduce a connected account of his ideas on religion and morality , and to discuss their philosophical validity .

		The great defect of such a method , as applied to
Browning	PERSON	, is that , being a dramatic poet , a large part of such utterances belong to the characters he creates .

		Jew ,
Greek	LOCATION	, Christian , or Persian and are not , in any sense , expressions of the poet 's own personal opinions .

		It is no wonder , then , that Professor Jones finds
Browning	PERSON	's philosophy '' inconsistent '' at many points , and that the reader , like the unlettered men after reading the annotated edition of
Bunyan	PERSON	's '' Pilgrim 's Progress , '' finds the explanations more obscure than the text .

		Still , the book is one to stimulate thought , and will prove congenial to those fond of the phraseology of metaphysics .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		From the Roycrof t Printing Shop in
East Aurora	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, we have received two beautifully-printed books that must take a high rank among examples of the best modern workmanship in the craft which they exemplify .

		They are editions of the `` Song of Songs '' and the '' Book of
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, '' each having an introductory essay by Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	.

		The books are hand - printed from a special font of Romanesque type , and are a delight to the eye .

		Both editions are limited . ''

		Lyra Celtica '' is the title of a beautifully-printed volume of representative Celtic poetry , edited by Mrs.
Elizabeth A. Sharp	PERSON	, and provided by Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	with notes and an elaborate introduction .

		Besides the host of modern poets represented , the ancient bards of
Cornwall	LOCATION	,
Armorica	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
Scotland	LOCATION	are illus - trated in translations that have been made with excep - tional skill for the purpose .

		-LRB- Imported by Scribner . -RRB- ''

		Jersey Street and Jersey Lane '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the title of a pretty volume containing a half-dozen clever urban and suburban sketches by the late
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	.

		The titles are : `` Jersey and Mulberry , '' ``
Tiemann	PERSON	's to Tubby Hook , '' `` The Bowery and
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' `` The Story of a Patch , '' The Lost Child , '' '' A Letter to Town . ''

		The papers abound in characteristic touches , whimsical and pathetic , and fairly illustrate the quali - ties which justly endeared Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	to his readers .

		The book is acceptably illustrated .


Baron Ferdinand Rothschild	PERSON	's '' Personal Character - istics from French History '' -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a rather promiscuous assortment of French bon mots culled from many sources and strung together on a thin thread of not very searching or felicitous comment and apprecia - tion , with a view of helping the reader to '' an idea , however superficial , of some of the salient characteris - tics of certain notable actors in the drama of French history . ''

		The Baron 's list begins with
Hugues Capet	PERSON	, and ends with the Abb3 Sie ` yes .

		The work has a cer - tain scrap-book value , and has seventeen portraits .

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ANNOUNCEMENTS or FALL , BOOKS .

		THE DIAL 'S list of books announced for Fall issue by American publishers , which has become an important annual feature of the paper , is this year the largest ever given .

		It contains about 900 titles , against 700 last year ; and represents fifty-one publishers , nine more than last year .

		The average of books to a publisher is also increased , eighteen this year , and seventeen last year .

		The greatest number of entries for one house -LRB- that of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an even hundred titles .

		The classification of , the books into departments adds greatly to the interest of the list , and furnishes the basis of some suggestive analysis and comment in the leading editorial article of this issue .

		The great length of the list makes it necessary to defer the department of Juveniles until our next number .

		All the books in this list are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		He will be in

		The Athenaeum '' is the source of the following note : '' The death is announced of the German lady who was known under the name of '
Camilla Selden	PERSON	, ' and who so tenderly nursed
Heine	PERSON	during the last months of his painful illness .

		The poet , who gave her the name of ' Mouche , ' addressed to her his last poem , and the letters he wrQte to her were most pathetic . '


Camilla Selden	PERSON	, ' whose real name was
Elise von Krienitz	PERSON	, pub - lished in
1884	DATE	a book entitled
Les Derniers Jours de Henri Heine	ORGANIZATION	. '

		She latterly resided at

		We learn from the
London	LOCATION	'' Literary World '' that Mr.
R.

		Such authors from over the

Emerson	LOCATION	,

Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Eight new '' Old South Leaflets '' have just been issued .

		The first of these leaflets , No. 66 , is a reprint of Win - throp 's famous '' Little Speech '' on Liberty , as given in the old Governor 's Journal ; No. 67 is
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	's `` Bostonian Ebenezer , '' from the `` Magnalia '' ; No. 68 , Governor

		The last five of these eight leaflets illustrate the original mate - rial in which Irving ,
Bancroft	LOCATION	,
Prescott	PERSON	,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, and
Parkman	PERSON	worked in the preparation of their histories .

		Every student of English literature , whether in this country or elsewhere , will mourn the death of
Francis James Child	PERSON	, which occurred on the eleventh of this month .

		As an authority upon his chosen subject he was easily the first among American scholars , and as a teacher and scholar in the department of English studies his influence was probably greater than that of any other American specialist of his generation .

		His professorial connection with
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, his alma mater , dates from
1851	DATE	, and was continued unbroken for forty-five years .

		If we reckon from the time of the tutorship which immediately followed upon his gradua - tion , we may credit him with an even half-century of educational work in the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was seventy - one years old at the time of his death .

		His greatest work is the monumental '' English and Scottish Popular Ballads , '' of which the first volume appeared in
1883	DATE	, and which has been continued down to the present time , eight or nine volumes altogether being produced .

		Whenever an Englishman of any prominence dies ,
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	is promptly on hand with an obituary poem , usually a sonnet .

		The tribute to the late Lady
Tennyson	PERSON	, in '' The Academy , '' derives a peculiar interest from the fact that it was in the vicarage of
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	's father that the poet was wedded to Miss
Emily Selwood	PERSON	.

		Here are the verses : '' The Poet went his Pilot at the bar Gave him God - speed and turned toward the land Where lone upon the shore , with waving hand , Stood one who followed still her guiding star And watched it mount to heaven .

		Tho ' sundered far , Its glory sent such gladness to the strand She waited patient , till the great command Came calling her to where the immortals are .

		`` Oh !

		sweet the memory of the Lincoln lane , And sweet the joy of
Shiplake	ORGANIZATION	's marriage-bell , Sweet , happy hours in
Aldworth	PERSON	's glade of pine , Or that loose - ordered garden known so well , But sweeter far , beyond all touch of pain , To feel thy love indissolubly thine ! ''

		GENIUS AND DEGENERATION .

		A Study in Psychology .

		By Dr.
WILLIAM HIBSCH	PERSON	.

		With a Preface by Prof. Dr.
E. MENDEL	PERSON	.

		Translated from the second edition of the German work .

		Uniform with '' De - generation . ''

		Large 8vo , cloth ,
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		In his now famous book , Dr.
Nordau	PERSON	startled the reading world by his cry of '' Degeneration '' ; Dr.
Hirsch	PERSON	opposes his conclusions by demon - strating the difference between `` Genius '' and '' Degeneration , '' and analyzing the social , literary , and artistic manifestations of the day dis - passionately and with a wealth of suggestive illustrations .

		In a brilliant explanation of the psychology of genius he shows that
Lombroso	PERSON	and Nordau make no distinction between scientific genius based upon hard work and artistic genius ; nor between genius and talent .

		He points to Goethe as an example of a perfectly developed genius .

		He answers spe - cifically
Nordau	ORGANIZATION	's claim that this is an age of hysterical disorder , and after an extended , brilliant , and informing discussion of Art and
Insan	PERSON	- ity , in which he shows himself a confirmed Wagnerian , he summarizes his conclusions by absolutely declining to accept
Nordau	ORGANIZATION	's point of view .

		The field which he traverses is too broad to be measured in this note , but it is safe to say that the book is one which must be read by every reader of Nordau , and should be read by every intelligent person who wishes to understand the spirit of his time and the lessons which history teaches the psychologist .

		In this entertaining volume of social and political history and per - sonal anecdotes Mr.

		Like a modern

		Professor
Trowbridge	PERSON	's long experience both as an original investigator and as a teacher imparts a peculiar value to this important work .

		Find - ing that no treatise could be recommended which answers the question , '' What is Electricity ? ''

		satisfactorily , he has explained in a popular way the electro-magnetic theory of light and heat , and the subject of periodic currents and electric waves , seeking an answer for his titular question in the study of the transformations of energy and a considera - tion of the hypotheses of movements in the ether .

		As modern applica - tions of electricity illustrate the great subject of the transformation of energy , the author has simplified forms of apparatus and methods of exhibiting new phenomena .

		200 THE EXTENSIONS OF LITERARY ACTIVITY .

		In spite of all that has of late been written upon the subject , it is still a difficult matter for the occidental to realize the immense transfor - mation that recent years have wrought in the realm of the
Mikado	LOCATION	.

		The old prepossessions are so strong upon us that we still instinctively class the Japanese with the other orientals , and are slow to recognize the fact that their newly - acquired culture and civilization have at last fairly brought them within the limits of the Western world and its intellectual comity .

		These reflections have often been suggested to us of late , and are suggested anew by the read - ing of a '' Summary of Current Japanese Lit - erature '' published in a recent issue of '' The
Japan	LOCATION	Daily Mail . ''

		We can not read such a summary without a deepening of the feeling that the modern Japanese are indeed '' men and brothers , '' that our intellectual problems are also theirs , and that we may enjoy an intelligent and sympathetic share in their struggle for de - velopment .

		When we read , for example , that a list of recent translations into Japanese in - cludes Professor
Westermark	PERSON	's '' Evolution of Marriage , '' '' The Origin of Species , '' and the '' Kritik der Reinen Vernunft , '' we may won - der at the process of reproducing , say , the transcendental a3sthetic of
Kant	PERSON	in a language of agglutinative type , but we must accept the fact that a people who can translate and read such books is one that can not be classed with the inferior races of mankind .

		It was , of course , through translations that the Japanese of the new era had to get the begin - nings of modern culture .

		Among many work - ers in this field ,
Nakamura Keiu	ORGANIZATION	and
Fuku	ORGANIZATION	- zawa
Yukichi	PERSON	are named as pioneers .

		For the first fifteen years or so of the Meiji period , `` translations good and bad , of well-known foreign works in all the principal book - shops crowded out the old Japanese and Chinese works hitherto in such request . ''

		Then came a sort of national reaction , and a number of men set to producing original literature of a lighter sort .

		A single book by
Yano Fumio	PERSON	is said to have '' brought him in a small fortune , ''
Tsubouchi Shoyo	PERSON	was the '' father of modern novelists , '' and wrote books with such titles as 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' A Conjugal Mirror , '' '' A Dream about the Future , '' and `` Incidents in the Life of Caesar . ''

		One novelist of this earlier period is described as '' noted for his polished style and powerful grouping of incidents '' ; another is said to have `` discussed the relation of the sexes and blended the elements of romance found in foreign works of fiction so as to suit Japanese readers '' ; while a third , '' an ardent admirer of Zola , '' was dis - tinguished by `` his earnest advocacy of the amalgamation of the colloquial and the written styles . ''

		Just such things as these might be said of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, and
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	. ''

		The demand for novels was so great that new editions of numbers of almost forgotten works were published , and there sprang into existence a ' Novel Publishing Company , ' which , while the rage lasted , drove a roaring trade , and a novel publishing magazine , which obtained a wide cir - culation . ''

		How exactly these statements would apply to recent aspects of book production in
London	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	; with what fellow-feeling do we read how , after '' a certain amount of satiety on the part of readers , the ordinary love - story gave place to the detective story , which was rendered popular by
Kuroiwa Ruiko	PERSON	! ''

		Read for this strange name Gaboriau or
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, and the parallel is obvious .

		The present era in Japanese letters , we are told , '' is the age of newspapers and magazines . ''

		In this periodical literature , we find discussions of such subjects as the translations of technical terms , the incompetency of translators in gen - eral , the practice of composing verses in the Chinese language , the degradation of literature by the commercial spirit , the excessive preva - lence of fiction in the periodicals , and the rash but amusing cocksureness of youthful critics of literature .

		A writer on the last of these subjects is particularly severe . ''

		With no ad - equate knowledge of English , men compose treatises on the comparative merits of English poets ; raw students of German express a pref - erence for one German poet rather than an - other .

		These things are a disgrace to the whole Japanese literary world . ''

		Another writer in - veighs in hearty fashion against magazine poetry .

		One of his remarks leads us to suspect that Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	has his Japanese ana - logue . ''

		As for the verses known as Icyoshi -LRB- crazy verses -RRB- they are like the squibs let off by children .

		They create a momentary sensa - tion , but they will sink into lasting oblivion . ''

		Still another writer complains that since the conclusion of the war there has been a '' want of ardor in literary matters . '' ''

		It shows itself in the world of romance , the modern novelist expecting to effect with his forty or fifty pages what in former days it took five or six times that number to accomplish . ''

		The book-weariness of the modern world appears to be felt in
Japan	LOCATION	, as it is elsewhere ; and those among us who in their more gloomy moods are inclined to think the invention of printing an evil will read with approval the following summary of a Japanese discussion of this subject : '' Facilities for publishing books are now so great that literary tyros are encouraged to inflict their crude ideas on the reading world .

		The methods used for self - advertisement in recent times are of a most objection - able kind .

		Authors entirely unknown to fame publish books containing their own photographs .

		Little children are encouraged to send literary contributions to such papers as the '
Shonen Zasshi	PERSON	, ' and then the photograph of the person considered the best youthful composer is supplied to the subscribers .

		The bad effects of all this fuss on the minds of young people must be patent to everybody .

		In the old days when every character that a book contained had to be carved , only those that had something important to say ventured to publish a book , and booksellers took no leaps in the dark . ''

		Some interesting statistics are devoted to the periodical press of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		During the past five years , the country had an average of nearly eight hundred newspapers and magazines .

		Of these the average circulation has varied from about 250 copies in
1890	DATE	to about 450 in
1894	DATE	.

		But the most surprising thing about these sta - tistics is the revelation they afford of the brevity of the life enjoyed by a Japanese magazine or newspaper .

		Over half the entire number for any given year give up the unequal struggle -LRB- which is not surprising when we look at the circulation statistics -RRB- and are replaced by am - bitious new ventures , for the most part destined , no doubt , to an equally ephemeral life .

		For example , 802 periodicals are reported at the close of
1893	DATE	.

		During
1894	DATE	, no less than 506 of them were discontinued , yet no fewer than 518 new periodicals sprang up to fill their places , making the total 814 , and once more vindicating the poet who tells us that '' hope springs eternal in the human breast . ''

		Japanese periodical literature is evidently in the '' Chap Book '' and '' Philistine '' stage of its develop - ment , and might give points to the hopeful youths who are now engaged in swelling the list of American periodicals .

		This record of aimless and unsuccessful ex - periment does not , however , tell the whole story of contemporary Japanese literature .

		We get a very different view of the matter from such
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 announcements as the two that follow .

		A his - tory of the late war with
China	LOCATION	has been planned under government auspices , and is expected to require five years of work and fifty thousand yen of money .

		The
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken the still greater task of preparing an exhaustive history of
Japan	LOCATION	, and a committee of sixteen scholars is now at work collecting , classifying , and editing the voluminous mate - rials needed for such a work .

		The writer of our summary notes also the urgent need of a comprehensive dictionary or encyclopaedia of Japanese literature .

		Works of this class already in existence are little more than cata - logues of titles , and '' there is no country in the world where the names of books are more mis - leading than they are in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Other mat - ters are touched upon in the highly interesting article which has served us as a text upon the present occasion , but enough has already been reproduced to convey a distinct idea of the con - dition of literary endeavor in our neighbor - empire of the West , and to show that men meet with the same intellectual problems everywhere , whatever the skies above their heads .

		TWO POETS .

		ROSSETTI .

		A strange life and a dreamful life he led , Strange in its methods , dreamful in its moods ; He seeks occult and vissionary woods , By vague elusive things inhabited ; His Orphic soul , imagination-sped , Betakes itself to voiceful solitudes , Where emulous love imperially broods , Fond , ardor-flushed , superb , and passion-fed .

		Song-sound uniquely volumed he obtains From sources alien to his native speech ; Masterful quivering cadences he gains , Like thrill and throb of billows on the beach ; The splendor of his rhythmic sweep remains Within and yet beyond our dazzled reach .

		POE .

		He is the poet of the weird and drear : For things uncanny he awakes and calls ; He sits with midnight in deserted halls , Amid the hush and imminence of fear ; He walks where foul shapes hover hugely near , Where death 's chill step his shuddering soul appalls ; He sees in caves , round hollow waterfalls , Slim serpents their hot hissing crests uprear .

		In visions vague , disconsolate , and grim , He roams lone lands where wailing winds blow shrill , And the gaunt ghost of desolation dwells ; With ebon croak the
Raven	ORGANIZATION	comes to him ; Then , music-tranced , he hears the throb , the thrill , The revel and the rapture of the Bells .


A. T. SCHUMAN	PERSON	.

		THOSE A U AS PROSE WRITER .

		Thoreau 's prose writings , as published in com - plete form in eleven volumes , make it for the first time possible to come to any clear and full judg - ment concerning his character and place as a writer of artistic prose .

		What is
Thoreau	LOCATION	's best work ?

		What is his rank among artists ?

		If his life had been prolonged , would he have done better work than he actually accomplished ?

		To these and the like interesting questions it is now possible to give some definite answer .

		Let us begin with the first , and consider what is
Thoreau	LOCATION	's best and most char - acteristic expression of himself . ''

		Walden '' is usually pointed out as
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece .

		But while this is certainly a very brilliant piece of writing , and has a unity too often lacking in his other works , it yet affords but a slight clue to the real
Thoreau	LOCATION	; for here he addresses an inquiring public desirous of knowing in detail his hut-life by
Walden	PERSON	pond , and in the whole course of the book he keeps this audience in mind , goes out to meet it , and by a most conspicuously popu - lar style adapts himself to it .

		In lightsome mood , and with many a satirical stroke and humorous touch , he tells this
Walden	PERSON	story .

		What can be finer , as a playful image , than his complaint that the `` Iron Horse , '' `` whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town , has muddied the Boiling
Spring	DATE	with his foot , and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore . ''

		But with all its excellence of style , `` Walden '' is comparatively superficial in both matter and manner .

		If we would find
Tboreau	ORGANIZATION	's deeper self , we must search elsewhere .

		Let us look then to the Journals , as printed in the four volumes entitled `` Spring , '' `` Summer , '' `` Autumn , '' and '' Winter . ''

		Here
Thoreau	PERSON	writes merely for himself and to please himself , and so re - veals his true self .

		The '' journalizing , '' he says , is '' an effort to expose my innermost and richest wares to light . ''

		The Journals are then , I take it , most im - portant documents to help us in fully understanding and appreciating the real
Thoreau	PERSON	and his art .

		Here we find , indeed , much treasure , both silver and gold ; but also some base metal , both brass and pewter .

		As a specimen of his basest metal , we extract a few lines from his profuse and foolish musings on a big toadstool : '' Such growths ally our age to those earlier periods which geology reveals .

		I wondered if it had not some relation to the skunk , though not in odor , yet in its color and the general impression it made .

		It suggests a veg - etative force which may almost make man tremble for his dominion .

		It carries me back to the era of the for - mation of the coal measures , the age of the Saurus and the Pliosaurus , and when bull-frogs were as big as bulls .

		... Is it not a giant mildew or mold ?

		In the warm , muggy night the surface of the earth is mildewed .

		The mold is the flower of humid darkness and ignorance .

		The pyramids and other monuments of
Egypt	LOCATION	are a vast mildew or toad-stool which have met with no light of day sufficient to waste them away . ''

		This is mere sophomoric crudeness and callow maun - 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, dering .

		And such slipshod thought is not infrequent in the Journals , though often in a measure redeemed hy accuracy and purity of style .

		We have met with but one bad error in style , and this is so ludicrously bad that it is worth quoting .

		Describing the win - tergreen blossom ,
Thoreau	PERSON	says , '' It is a very pretty little chandelier of a flower , fit to adorn the forest floor . ''

		Possibly
Thoreau	PERSON	's slight acquaintance with ball-rooms made him overlook the fact that chan - deliers do not usually adorn floors .

		But it is very pleasant to the patient searcher among the Journals to find amid the baser metals nuggets of purest gold ; here and there he comes upon passages of descriptive literature of the high - est order .

		Take , for instance , the description of the felling and dismembering of a giant pine by the lumberman .

		We can quote only the conclusion of this woodland tragedy .

		The tree felled , the chopper '' Has measured it with his ax and marked off the small logs it will make .

		It is lumber ... When the fish-hawk in the
spring	DATE	revisits the banks of the Mus - ketaquid , he will circle in vain to find his accustomed perch , and the hen-hawk will mourn for the pines lofty enough to protect her brood ... I hear no knell tolled , I see no procession of mourners in the streets or the woodland aisles .

		The squirrel has leaped to another tree , the hawk has circled farther off , and has now set - tled upon a new eyrie , but the woodman is preparing to lay his ax at the root of that also . ''

		This has genuine quality , as has also the following description of a bobolink 's song : '' I hear the note of a bobolink concealed in the top of an apple-tree behind me .

		Though this bird 's full strain is ordinarily somewhat trivial , this one appears to be meditating a strain as yet .

		unheard in meadow or orchard .

		Paulo majora canamus .

		He is just touching the strings of his theorbo , his glassichord , his water organ , and one or two notes globe themselves and fall in liquid bubbles from his harp within a vase of liquid melody , and when he lifted it out the notes fell like bubbles from the trembling strings .

		Methinks they are the most liquidly sweet and melodious sounds I ever heard .

		They are as refreshing to my ear as the first dis - tant tinkling and gurgling of a rill to a thirsty man .

		Oh , never advance farther in your art ; never let us hear your full strain , sir !

		But away he launches , and the meadow is all bespattered with melody .

		... It is the foretaste of such strains as never fell on mortal ears , to hear which we should rush to our doors and contribute all that we possess and are . ''

		Where will you find anything finer in its way than this ?

		It is truly , like the bobolink 's , a large and noble strain .

		And many of
Thoreau	PERSON	's descriptions of notes of birds and animals have a very rare qual - ity , as when he writes of the cock 's clarion , the blackbird 's song , and the bullfrog 's trump .

		To show once more what
Thoreau	PERSON	in his best mood can do , look at this little landscape sketch : '' The air is clear as if a cool , dewy brush had swept the meadows of all haze .

		A liquid coolness invests them , as if their midnight aspect were suddenly revealed to midday .

		The mountain outline is remarkably distinct , and the intermediate earth appears more than usually scooped out like a vast saucer sloping upwards to its sharp mountain rim .

		The mountains are washed in air . ''

		This picture of pellucid air is remarkably artistic .

		Nought is florid or forced , but the expression is sin - gularly close , clear , and grand .

		The phrase , '' The mountains are washed in air , '' touches the sublime ; it strikes the keynote of a Nature hymn .

		For the moment
Thoreau	PERSON	soars the empyrean with eagle sweep .

		We confess to enjoying such slight but exquisite sketches as these from the Journals far more than the elaborate and conscious efforts in ''
Walden	PERSON	. '' ''

		Walden '' is exoteric , the Journals are esoteric . ''

		Walden '' has not the deep seriousness , the solemn rapture , which pervades these records of daily life .

		Here we see more clearly than elsewhere how strongly
Thoreau	PERSON	is thrilled and uplifted by nature 's beauty .

		This '' vision '' affects him more '' deeply and powerfully '' than aught else .

		Hence he is a haunter of fields and rivers , of woods and hills ; and , far withdrawing from the roar of modern me - chanic life , he would '' lurk , '' he says , '' in crystal - line thought , like the trout under verdurous banks , where stray mankind should only see my bubble coming to the surface . ''

		But though
Thoreau	PERSON	often rises to rapture in his marvellously sensitive response to nature , he yet never attains real poetic expression .

		He has the raw material in plenty ; but , as
Emerson	PERSON	says , '' thyme and marjoram are not yet honey . ''

		Thoreau regards the art of metre , rhyme , and rhythm as too much akin to artifice .

		He thinks that the '' very scheme and form '' of poetry is adopted at '' a sac - rifice of vital truth and poetry , '' and he refuses to make this sacrifice .

		Thoreau has been called the '' poet-naturalist . ''

		We have seen that he is not a poet , and it is equally plain that he is not a naturalist .

		Throughout his Journals ,
Thoreau	PERSON	iterates and reiterates that he is not a scientist , and that science has no vital interest for him .

		Indeed , the spirit of science is in the directest opposition to
Thoreau	LOCATION	's ; for while science does away with the personal equation ,
Thoreau	PERSON	mag - nifies it .

		He values nature not as a source of mere knowledge for its own sake , but as a fount of de - light and inspiration which pours through his whole being .

		In all his close observation of nature , he seeks , not information , but beauty and sympathy . ''

		In what book , '' he asks , '' is this world and its beauty described ?

		Who has plotted the steps toward the discovery of beauty ?

		You must be in a different state from common .

		Your greatest success will be simply to conceive that such things are , and you will have no communication to make to the Royal Society . ''

		Thoreau thus shows an artist 's dislike of cold , unimpressionable science .

		He desires above all things to feel deeply the supernal beauty of na - ture , and to give large expression of this emotion in living prose ; in short ,
Thoreau	PERSON	is preeminently an artist , and in particular an impressionist of the open - air school .

		Out-of-doors is the subject of his art ; there is his studio , and , indeed , also his home , his theatre , his university , and his church .

		But
Thoreau	PERSON	is not equally open to all sides of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 nature .

		He lived for some time by the sea , and often visited its shore ; yet , so far as we may judge from his writings , he was not much affected by the wondrous beauty and majesty of old ocean .

		He wandered over
Cape Cod	LOCATION	; he made excursions to the
White Mountains	LOCATION	, to the
Maine	LOCATION	woods , and to
Canada	LOCATION	; but his writings thereabout and
Thoreau	PERSON	is very faithful to himself in all his writing are quite juiceless and uninspired .

		But let
Thoreau	PERSON	once set foot on the well-beloved fields of
Concord	LOCATION	, walk in its forests , glide along its smooth-flowing river , and he at once utters a fresh , deep , and strong note .

		Even Monadnock and Wachusett thrill him chiefly as seen from
Concord	LOCATION	.

		All that is best in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's life and art centres in rural
Concord	LOCATION	; he is its lit - erary Genius loci ; he broods over its every phase , and voices his observation and meditation in sen - tences full of rarest insight and clearest beauty .

		Away from
Concord	LOCATION	he is ill at ease , and only par - tially receptive of the divine message of nature . ''

		I am afraid , '' he says , '' to travel much , or to famous places , lest it might completely dissipate the mind .

		Then I am sure that what we observe at home , if we observe anything , is of more importance than what we observe abroad .

		The far-fetched is of the least value . ''

		Thoreau 's writings show several styles .

		We dis - tinguish five .

		First is the adolescent , diffuse , ro - mantic style of '' The Week . ''

		This work we find intensely wearisome in its smooth discursiveness and sophomoric sententiousness .

		Second , there is the dry , matter-of-fact style of the ''
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, '' ''
Maine Woods	PERSON	, '' and '' Yankee in
Canada	LOCATION	'' narra - tives .

		Here he is objective and reportorial .

		Thoreau himself speaks of the ''
Canada	LOCATION	story '' as simply a '' report '' of what he saw , and as '' not worth the time I took to tell it . ''

		This is , perhaps , too harsh a judgment ; but still , all his stories of travel , though touched with a lucid simplicity , are yet on the whole quite meagre and commonplace .

		Again , we have the style of ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' brilliant , sketchy , charming , but never satisfying , because it both reveals and conceals .

		And again , we have the frank , plain , but often noble style of the best parts of the Journals and Letters .

		This writing is very concise and clear , often limpid , and generally slow of movement .

		However , the pine-tree episode , from which we have quoted , has much the swing of '' Walden '' ; and in the Journals we find also the adolescent style , and even the dry narrative style , as in the account of the
White Mountain	ORGANIZATION	trip .

		Lastly , we have the per - fectly sound , sensible , sober style of the essay on '' Wild Apples . ''

		This is a very delightful bit of prose , and , I think , quite the best complete work that
Thoreau	PERSON	has left us .

		It shows that he could in his latter days give a unity of development and a mature expression , mellowed , withal , by a thor - oughly genial humor a humor wholly free from that satiric acidity which gives a bad taste to so much of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's production .

		The catalogue of the kinds of wild apples reminds one of
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	.

		With whom shall we compare
Thoreau	PERSON	as a painter of nature ?

		Not with White of
Selborne	LOCATION	, for
White	ORGANIZATION	is primarily a scientist , while
Thoreau	PERSON	is above all and before all an artist .

		Not with
Ruskin	PERSON	, for though both are artists , they are very diverse ;
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	sees nature through the medium of the
Bible	LOCATION	and
Turner	PERSON	, but
Thoreau	PERSON	could allow neither priest nor painter to be his interpreter , and so he felt him - self radically out of tune with the great art critic .

		And further , the rich and cloying style of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	is altogether unlike the crystalline simplicity of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's best work .

		In his mind and art ,
Thoreau	PERSON	is much nearer to
Wordsworth	PERSON	than to either White or
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		Both
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	are entirely individual and direct in their approach to nature , seeking at all times an unprepossessed impression , which they would express in the sim - plest and freest art ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in prosaic poe - try ;
Thoreau	LOCATION	, in poetic prose .

		For both , nature is a source not merely of aesthetic but also of ethical inspiration , though
Wordsworth	PERSON	has a mature strength and poise , an abiding rock-like solidity , quite foreign to
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Both are local in their sentiment , the
Lake	LOCATION	country being to
Wordsworth	PERSON	what
Concord	LOCATION	was to
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		For a particular comparison of work , read the description of the bob - olink 's song , before mentioned , and then read these lines of
Wordsworth	PERSON	on a nightingale 's song : '' O Nightingale !

		thou surely art A creature of a fiery heart ; These notes of thine they pierce and pierce ; Tumultuous harmony and fierce !

		Thou sing ` st as if the God of wine Had helped thee to a
Valentine	LOCATION	; A song in mockery and despite Of shades , and dews , and silent Night ; And steady bliss , and all the loves Now sleeping in these peaceful Groves . ''

		The art of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is here more perfect and eloquent than
Thoreau	PERSON	's , but
Thoreau	PERSON	excels in inti - macy with nature and in fulness and closeness of expression .

		Thoreau is the more intense and thor - ough student of nature , and if he could have put his impression of the bobolink 's song into adequate poetic form it would have been a nobler piece than
Wordsworth	PERSON	's lines to a nightingale .

		Thoreau 's matter is superior , but his manner is inferior .

		What , then , is
Thoreau	LOCATION	's rank as literary artist ?

		And has he , indeed , any permanent place in litera - ture ?

		We can with all safety predict that the greater part is perishable .

		It is plain enough that '' The Week , '' the stories of the
Cape Cod	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, and
Canada	LOCATION	excursions , and most of the `` Miscellanies , '' are perishable third-rate work . ''

		Walden '' is cer - tainly a brilliant piece of its kind , but that not the highest ; and in the Journals we have a sketch-book containing some very beautiful studies , but no finished work .

		However , in my judgment the essay on '' Wild Apples '' shows
Thoreau	PERSON	at his best , and in his true function ; but even this needs pruning , and the theme is rather small and narrow .

		What an essay Thoreau could have given us on Bird-song !

		It would have been a classic .

		If
Thoreau	PERSON	had lived 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, his allotted span , he might have produced some won - derfully fine work on such lines ; but as it is , we can only lament the unfulfilled promise of an artist uniquely great in animal and landscape word paint - ing .

		Thoreau was undoubtedly one of those rarest visitors to our planet a genius ; and , what is more , a genius true to himself , who never swerved to the right or left in following out his bent .

		AN
AMERICAN ENDOWED THEATRE	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The arguments that favor a theatre subsidized and controlled by the State can , I suppose , all be used in favor of an endowed theatre ; and of course an endowed theatre is the only one of the two which at present seems in any way possible in
America	LOCATION	.

		To the sojourner on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	the subsidized national theatre seems to be one of the most effective instruments of popular aesthetic education which could be devised , and the total lack of anything equivalent to it in
America	LOCATION	to be one of the most distressing and humiliating de - fects in our civilization .

		The good that such establish - ments do here is almost in every respect as patent and appreciable as the good accomplished in
America	LOCATION	by endowed libraries and universities , and it is difficult to conjure up objections of any weight to the proposition that an endowed theatre in any large American city , which should set itself to follow strictly the lines of policy adopted by such an institution as the Theatre Franc.ais in
Paris	LOCATION	, or the three national theatres in the city of
Munich	LOCATION	, would be there just as beneficent and effective an instrument of culture as here .

		These reflec - tions occur to me after having witnessed recently in the Hof Theater in
Munich	LOCATION	as impressive and adequate a performance of '' Lear '' as is likely to be heard by any American in a generation which so rarely hears such masterpieces of tragedy as '' Lear '' and '' Macbeth . ''

		Not that the
King Lear	PERSON	of
Herr Schneider	PERSON	and the Cordelia of
Fraulein Dandier	PERSON	were masterpieces of tragic acting , but that the entire performance from the highest part to the lowest was an example of sincere and earnest art , such as could be possible only where the influence of the box-office is practically eliminated , and where the ambitions and jealousies of '' stars , '' the silly centring of interest upon the personality of the actors and actresses , and the clamor of the galleries , are all alike considerations that can safely be disregarded .

		A national theatre which in the course of a fortnight can offer some six or seven operas , mostly by
Wagner	PERSON	,
Beethoven	PERSON	, and
Mozart	PERSON	, '' Lear '' and '' Hamlet , '' and Goethe 's '' Tasso , '' besides comedies and lighter pieces , as an average repertory , might well claim to serve as a model for our American endowed theatre when we have it !

		WHAT CONSTITUTES PROOF ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The facts pointed out under the heading '' Dogmatic Philology '' by a correspondent in your issue of
Sept. 1	DATE	are worthy of emphasis .

		They warn us against absolute dicta unless we are safely within the confines of careful definition , a warning that to my mind your correspondent might well have heeded .

		The sentences quoted by him in defense of his criticism range from Homer to Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	, and prove , as I think , either too much or too tittle .

		Does not the writer assume that rhetoric never changes ?

		Does he not accept an idiom in one language as evidence of acceptable usage in another tongue ?

		What pertinency is there otherwise to his quotations from Sophocles ,
Chauteaubriand	LOCATION	, or even from Spenser and
Milton	PERSON	?

		Words become obsolete .

		May not usages of phrase ?

		Is the rhetoric of a given epoch other than the usage of the best writers of that period ?

		In many respects we may not write as did Spenser or even Mil - ton .

		Historical rhetoric is an instructive and fascinat - ing study , but we can not use its data unquestioned in our assaults upon the rulings of rhetoricians .

		If the text-books give instructions contrary to present usage , the evidence is ready to our hand and any critic may collect it .

		There is great need that someone should set forth convincing evidence in regard to many points of rhetorical usage .

		But arguments that muster the data of past centuries as proof of present usage are not so disappointing as those that rely upon unsupported data , the merest chances of composition , for the justification of destruc - tive criticism .

		What can we not prove if we cull an expression here and there from the books of accepted authors !

		In one instance , at least ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	has used whomsoever as subject of a finite verb because of the malign influence of a neighboring preposition .

		Addison and
Irving	PERSON	wrote phrasings that authors of to-day avoid .

		The evidence of acceptable usage must come from the works of such writers , but the laws of evidence obtain here as elsewhere .

		Our text-books of rhetoric need searching criticism probably no other text-books are so unsatisfactory ; but neither the evidence of historical usage nor that drawn from occasional usage by present writers much less the usage of foreign tongues is adequate for the determination of disputed points .

Alaska	LOCATION	situated about six miles from the mouth of the
Stikine River	LOCATION	, to the
Pelly Lakes	ORGANIZATION	and down the
Yukon River	LOCATION	to the
Behring Sea	LOCATION	, forms the subject of a very read - able volume entitled '' Through the Subarctic Forest , '' by Mr.
Warburton Pike	PERSON	.

		The first part of the journey lies chiefly along the route followed by the party sent out in
1887	DATE	by the
Geological Survey Party	ORGANIZATION	of
Canada	LOCATION	; but the country lying to the northeast of a line drawn from the north end of
Frances Lake	PERSON	to the site of the
Old Pelly Banks	ORGANIZATION	trading-post , partially traversed by Mr.
Pike	PERSON	, may be said to have been hitherto absolutely new ground .

		Of this tract , which he was the first to explore , the author gives a rough sketch-map , probably of approximate accuracy .

		The only geographical discovery of any importance made by Mr.
Pike	PERSON	was the rather negative one that the river drain - ing the
Pelly Lakes	ORGANIZATION	, and marked as the
Pelly	LOCATION	on the maps drawn up from Indian reports , is not really entitled to be so considered , but is only a small tributary of a large river heading towards the northeast , and rising probably on the western slope of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		This latter stream Mr.
Pike	PERSON	thinks is the Pelly proper .

		He dwells chiefly in his narrative on the
Pelly	LOCATION	and Liard district , which , though less remote , is far less known than the often-described coun - try of the Yukon and the
Behring Sea	LOCATION	.

		The craft in which Mr.
Pike	PERSON	's journey was mainly made was a canoe built of light spruce on the
Peterboro	LOCATION	' model .

		Her dimensions were : 18 feet length , 3 feet 6 inches beam , and 20 inches depth , with a total weight of 130 Ibs. ; and being a decided departure from local models , she was the subject of much ominous head-shaking and comment monitory and sar - castic on the part of canoeing wiseacres at
Fort Wrangel	LOCATION	.

		Her makers , however , as it proved , had builded even better than they knew ; for the little boat surpassed expectations .

		The start from

		Here the first fall of snow warned the voyageurs that their progress proper must soon be barred by the ice , and they pushed on to the
Upper Post	ORGANIZATION	, where it was proposed to winter , arriving on the
18th of October	DATE	.

		The winter months were passed in moose-hunting in the country to the west of the
Dease	PERSON	and south of the Liard , in a mining or prospecting expedition -LRB- which does not seem to have '' panned out '' very favorably -RRB- , and in hauling supplies and the canoe overland to
Frances Lake	PERSON	.

		On the
18th of April	DATE	the final start for the north and the
Pelly River	LOCATION	was made .

		The author 's account of the remainder of the journey down the
Pelly	PERSON	and the Yukon to
Ikosmut	LOCATION	, thence overland to the
Kuskokvim River	LOCATION	, down the Kuskokvim to the coast , along the coast -LRB- by canoe -RRB- to
Nushagak	LOCATION	, and thence by schooner to
Unalaska	LOCATION	is graphic and full of incident .

		One learns a good deal from him as to the condition of the Indians -LRB- of such , at least , as have come in pretty frequent contact with the Whites -RRB- of the far Northwest ; and the facts he offers do not , to put it mildly , re - dound to the credit of our civilization .

		It is mainly the old story of the red-man giving way to the white , acquiring and sinking under his vices , and falling through the various stages of disease and degradation into extinction .

		For him the white man 's touch is too often as a leper 's .

		Says the author : '' I do n't believe the Indian was ever the noble crea - ture he has often been painted .

		We can only suppose that in time past he led a harmless existence , and un - consciously did his duty in the particular station of life to which he had been called ; but , dress him up in the white man 's clothes , feed him on bacon and flour , canned peaches and molasses , give him a few drinks of whiskey , and he becomes a despicable brute .

		He does not like being taken away from all these good things , and has a 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, profound contempt for the few true Indians who still make a living in the woods by trapping the precious fur . ''

		While hunting in the Liard and
Dease	PERSON	re - gion , Mr.
Pike	PERSON	encountered a band of Liard Indians typical semi-degenerates , who were in pitiful case : '' Sickness was prevalent in the camp very few of the men were well enough to hunt moose , and they had come to the lake to be sure of making a living .

		A mel - ancholy spectacle the camp presented ; half a dozen pits in the snow lined with pine brush , a little more pine brush stuck up as a wind-break , and no other shelter from the weather .

		Lying in their blankets were the sick men , some of them evidently never to get up again dying among the moose hair and fish guts that were liberally scattered over everything ; and outside the filth of the camp the ice-bound lake sparkled in the winter sunshine that always seems so full of health and strength .

		What was the matter with them all ?

		< Oh !

		we 're always like this , ' the chief explained , ' since the white men came into the country .

		In the old time my tribe was powerful ; but now many of my people die every winter .

		Some children are born , but they are no good they die soon . ' ''

		Mr.
Pike	PERSON	suggests that as a good deal of money is spent annually by
Government	ORGANIZATION	on the Canadian Indians , it might be well to spare some of that money for this outlying district .

		A qualified doctor might at all events be sent thither '' to patch up as best he might the rem - nants of the tribes of the
Casca	LOCATION	and Liard Indians , and prevent the spread of contagion . ''

		Above all things , urges Mr.
Pike	PERSON	, let the man whose salary is paid be a doctor and not an Indian agent .

		Under present conditions , the end of these unfortunates seems near : '' No surveys are wanted ; no reservations need be staked off ; for , if the present state of affairs continues but a few more years , extinction will put every Indian beyond the limitation of the agent 's reserve . ''

		Touching the natives on the Behring Sea coast , Mr.
Pike	PERSON	observes that the damage done among them by the visits of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	whalers is already noticeable .

		A most flagrant case in point , that occurred a few years ago , caused a stir in the newspapers , but there was no official inquiry Government being appar - ently too busy looking after the fur seals to bother about the Innuits .

		It seems that a homeward-bound whaler put in at an island village off the coast , and succeeded in driving a lively trade with the natives , who were anx - ious to go in pursuit of the walrus which were then passing , and upon which they are depend - ent for their winter 's supply of food .

		The bar - gains were struck quickly , and the schooner sailed away with the wealth of the village under her hatches leaving behind her , unfortu - nately , a couple of kegs of strong rum in part payment .

		The issue was natural : '' By the time the natives had finished the rum and got over its effects , the walrus had passed , there was no supply of food put up for the winter , and ice was be - ginning to drift in the sea ... The next whaler that called at the island was able to take home an interesting collection of bones and skulls of the Esquimaux type to an ethnological institution ; but there was no man , wo - man , or child , left alive on the rum-stricken island to tell the story of starvation and death . ''

		Mr.
Pike	PERSON	appends to his narrative a chapter descriptive of the botanical and geological col - lections made in the course of his journey .

		The volume is acceptably illustrated , and there are two maps .

		Mr.
Walter Dwight Wilcox	PERSON	's finely illus - trated volume , '' Camping in the Canadian Rockies , '' contains some capital and timely de - scription of a magnificent region which , though still relatively unexplored and unmapped , must soon attract a large share of
summer	DATE	travel .

		Indeed , the tide is already setting somewhat strongly thitherward .

		During a period of four years the author has made camping and moun - taineering excursions into many of the wilder parts of the Rockies and the Selkirks , mak - ing a number of ascents notably of
Mount Temple	ORGANIZATION	, the highest peak yet climbed , his chief local points of departure being Banff -LRB- the focal point of the
Canadian National Park	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Lake Louise	PERSON	, and the
Glacier House	ORGANIZATION	, one of the two new hotels in the heart of the
Selkirk Range	ORGANIZATION	.

		One needs only to skim the narratives -LRB- as abridged by our author -RRB- of the pioneers ,
Mackenzie	PERSON	, Hector ,
Milton	LOCATION	, etc. , to judge how the modern camper and mountaineer must appreciate , in the intervals of his arduous holiday relaxations , the comforts of these well - appointed hostelries .

		Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	has a very good descriptive style , easily surpassing his predecessors in this respect .

		A fair example is his picture of a falling avalanche on
Mount Lefroy	LOCATION	a peak which , it may be remembered , was the scene
last summer	DATE	of the tragic death of Mr.
Philip Abbott	PERSON	, an estimable and prom - ising young man , whose Alpine experiences failed to ensure him against the perils of the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		Says Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	: '' I was standing at a point some two miles distant looking at this imposing mountain , when from the ver - tical ice wall a great fragment of the glacier , some three hundred feet thick and several times as long , broke away , and , turning slowly in mid-air , began to fall through the abyss .

		In a few seconds , amid continued silence , for the sound had not yet reached me , the great mass struck a projecting ledge of rock after a fall of some half thousand feet , and at the shock , as if by some inward explosion , the block was shivered into thousands of smaller fragments and clouds of white powdery ice .

		Simultaneously came the first thunder of the avalanche .

		The larger pieces led the way , some whirling around
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 in mid-air , others gliding down like meteors with long trains of snowy ice - dust trailing behind .

		The finer powered debris followed after , in a long succession of white streamers and curtains resembling cascades and waterfalls .

		The loud crash at the first great shock now developed into a prolonged thunder wherein were count - less lesser sounds of the smaller pieces of ice .

		It was like the sound of a great battle in which the sharp crack of rifles mingles with the roar of artillery .

		Leaping from ledge to ledge with ever increasing velocity , the large fragments at length reached the bottom of the precipice , while a long white train extended nearly the whole height of the grand mountain wall 2500 feet from base to top . ''

		While Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	was , during his several expeditions , chiefly '' on pleasure bent , '' camp - ing , climbing , and photography being his espe - cial hobbies , he did a fair amount of actual exploring of the arduous pioneering kind ; and his book adds materially to our knowledge of the topography of the region visited .

		There are two historical chapters on the work of early explorers , and the volume concludes with some general observations of a scientific tenor , touch - ing the '' pleasures of the natural sciences , '' the origin , age , and growth of mountains , nature of the forests , mountain lakes , etc. .

		But the burden of the book is the author 's graphic and enthusiastic account of his experiences in camp and on the mountain-side , and of the glorious scenery of the Rockies and the Selkirks .

		The volume contains twenty-five full-page photo - gravures and many vignettes after photographs that amply attest Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	's rare skill in managing and taste in placing his camera .

		There is no map , an omission which the author explains by saying that there are '' no detailed maps covering this region that are entirely satisfactory . ''

		This want seriously impairs the usefulness of a generally satisfactory book ; and we trust it will be supplied in a subsequent edition of it .

		Sabine 's '' Loyalists of the American Revolu - tion '' was for a long time a voice crying in the wilderness of national prejudice , and awaken - ing no response of sympathy or belief in minds fed on the mytho-historical literature which until just now satisfied the American historical instinct .

		But the new spirit that has at last produced an '' American Historical Review '' is modifying our estimate of every portion of our history .

		It would seem that men are only just beginning to read with discernment the vol - uminous original material , in the way of letters and diaries , that reveal to us the true mind and purpose of that age .

		And as we re-read , we are at last giving recognition to a body of worthy but unfortunate men , some of whom did large service for the republic in their earlier and happier days .

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	in his history , and Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	last year in the '' Historical Review , '' only voice a growing sentiment among thoughtful Ameri - cans a sentiment which can go back , how - ever , to so great a patriot as Alexander Ham - ilton for its vindication .

		We are now saying simply that the men who , with
Thomas Hutch	PERSON	- inson in the lead , stood by the mother country until they went down with her cause in per - sonal shipwreck and ruin , were many of them noble souls , ardent patriots , and devoted public servants ; and that their choice of the losing side in a great fight should not obliterate the knowlege of their high and disinterested pur - pose .

		Conservatives all of them , the stars in their courses fought against them , and they fell grandly .

		At the time of the outbreak of the troubles between
England	LOCATION	and the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, no man in
America	LOCATION	had deserved more of his fellow-men than
Thomas Hutchinson	PERSON	.

		As far back as
1749	DATE	, by his firm stand in the
Assem	LOCATION	- bly he had delivered the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	from the evils of an irredeemable paper currency .

		As a mem - ber of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, as Judge of Probate and of the Common Pleas , as
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, as Lieu - tenant Governor , and finally as Governor , he had for many years been the most conspicuous and the ablest man in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Born of a long line of ancestors devoted to the interests of that
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, well educated and highly placed by wealth and social standing , he filled the political horizon of the men of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	even more than
Washington	LOCATION	did that of the Virginians .

		Large-minded , public - spirited , and devoted to the public service , he seemed naturally fitted to take the patriot leadership in his province and in
New England	LOCATION	.

		But the 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, whole habit of his mind and of his life was essentially conservative .

		He believed thor - oughly that union with the mother country was for the best interests of both countries , and that the evils of independence would be far greater than any that the Colonies experienced from imperial misgovernment .

		In this faith he lived and ruled ; in this faith , when ruling was no longer possible , and merely living in the prov - ince had become to him dangerous , he went into exile , and died , a broken-hearted and pre - maturely old man .

		His career is one of the most pathetic in his - tory ; and Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	, the latest delineator of his life , has handled the lights and shades of the picture with much skill .

		Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	was well fitted by his past work to treat this diffi - cult subject with discernment and fairness .

		His well-known life of
Samuel Adams	PERSON	had been the result of much careful study of the conflict in which
Adams	PERSON	and
Hutchinson	PERSON	were the leaders .

		He says himself : '' It was while writing the life of that sturdiest and trustiest of the Sons of Liberty , that the worth and greatness of his opponent became plain to me .

		To draw one without drawing the other is as impossible as it would be to photograph a wrestler in action without catching at the same time the cham - pion with whom he was locked . ''

		In the book before us Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	has been most success - ful in the middle course which the truth com - pels him to take amid conflicting opinion .

		He is just to the patriots and the patriot cause , yet has redeemed his subject from the obloquy which for a century and more has rested on him .

		Mr.
J. J. Boudinot	PERSON	's work is not equal in excellence to that of Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	.

		He entitles his book '' The Life of
Elias Boudinot	PERSON	, '' and says in his preface : '' The purpose of this vol - ume is to place before the reader the services , speeches , and letters of
Elias Boudinot	PERSON	, in such chronological sequence that they shall for them - selves tell the history of his life . ''

		But the ed - itorial conception of the editor is so inadequate that the two volumes are merely a collection of miscellaneous material , not at all digested into any form adequate to present the life of
Elias Boudinot	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book contrasts poorly with such a work as
Kate Mason Rowland	PERSON	's '' Life , Cor - respondence , and Speeches of
George Mason	PERSON	, '' in which the individuality and personality of her great ancestor form a continuous back - ground to the array of documentary material edited .

		One gets herein little conception of
Elias Boudinot	LOCATION	; and yet he was a man of as persistent and consistent character as
Hutch	ORGANIZATION	- inson .

		A conservative also , in many respects , he yet took the patriot side from deep convic - tion , and served it actively , first as a member of the
New Jersey Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	, then as
Commissary-General of Prisoners	ORGANIZATION	through the nomination of General
Washington	LOCATION	, and finally as President of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In all these positions the Huguenot puritanism of his ancestors crops out , yet the conscientious and somewhat pietistic protestant is saved from narrowness by a catholic toleration of other men 's opinions far in advance of the religious mind of his day .

		These volumes are full of his simple Doric character , but one must gather it out bit by bit for himself .

		It is a pity that a running narrative has not threaded these iso - lated letters and speeches ; for all along is found the wisdom and fair-mindedness of one of the best of '' the fathers '' of the Constitution , both in the great mass of letters and in the appended speeches .

		A fine portrait of Boudinot at the age of fifty-eight , from the steel engraving by
St. Memin	ORGANIZATION	, faces the title-page to the first vol - ume , and a grand one at the age of seventy - seven from the painting by Sully is found in the second volume .

		In this respect the editor has been more fortunate than Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	, who has given us in truth a beautiful portrait of
Hutchinson	PERSON	from the painting by
Copley	LOCATION	, but it is the face of a youth , and does not in the least suggest the stern and stately old Governor whom men remember .

		THE ELIZABETHAN SONNETTEERS .

		* Mrs.
Martha Foote Crow	PERSON	is rendering a note - worthy service to students and readers in bring - ing together in accessible modern form , in her `` Elizabethan Sonnet - Cycles , '' the chief pro- ductions of the first English sonnetteers .

		The sonnet is a definite literary kind in
England	LOCATION	, having important and interesting historical connections with the earlier poetry of
Italy	LOCATION	, and a long and honorable history in English verse ; and it therefore may conveniently be isolated for study .

		The greatest Elizabethan exemplars of the sonnet ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Sidney	PERSON	, are of course easily accessible ; but the others ,
Daniel	PERSON	, Constable , Lodge ,
Giles Fletcher	PERSON	,
Drayton	PERSON	,

		THE DIAL 187 not easily accessible .

		This collection will make possible for all a study of the complete species of the English sonnet-sequence in its earliest development and a comparison of its earliest with its latest forms and motives .

		And it is no doubt true , as has often been said , that a lit - erary kind or a literary period can be most faithfully studied in its minor examples , where the type is undisturbed by the abnormalities and the adventitious gifts of genius .

		Not that something of the note of genius does not appear now and then even in the humblest of the Eliz - abethan lyrists , something of that peculiar magic of utterance , and of that vivida vis animi which Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	singles out as the leading characteristic of the age , but that in the minor sonnetteers this note is at best but sporadic , and that , although their work to the trained lover of poetry is readable throughout , still the interest of it after all is chiefly historical .

		Not infrequently indeed one comes upon a sonnet-octave such as the follow - ing , half-Shakespearian in diction and foreshad - owing the manner of the Shakespeare of the sonnets : '' Fair eyes , whilst fearful I your fair admire , By unexpressed sweetness that I gain , My memory of sorrow doth expire , And falcon-like I tower joy 's heaven amain .

		But when your suns in oceans of their glory Shut up their day-bright shine , I die for thought ; So pass my joys as doth a new-played story , And one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught . ''

		But it is not the sonnet-sequence of Lodge , or of
Daniel	PERSON	, or of Constable , that we should choose as the Elizabethan representative to put into comparison with a representative modern sonnet-sequence , such as
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' House of Life . ''

		No ; if we are debarred from Shake - speare 's , it would rather be
Sidney	PERSON	's or Spen - ser 's .

		But to render such a comparison fair and of any profit , aside from the comparison of gift with gift and genius with genius , we should first of all recognize that the convention of the Elizabethan sonnet-sequence is different from that of the modern , that it stands nearer the Petrarchan tradition -LRB- only very lately aban - doned in poetry -RRB- , that it has a different artistic aim , and that consequently it developed a dis - tinctive form and laws of its own .

		He who does this will recognize also that the form of the Elizabethan sonnet is entirely consonant with its spirit and aim , and he will be very cautious about dogmatizing concerning the superiority of the more '' orthodox '' modern sonnet structure .

		But in order to recognize all this , a study of the minor Elizabethan sonnet - cycles is pre-requisite .

		The natural Elizabethan impulse was more freely and fluently lyrical than suited altogether with the fixed canons of the sonnet , and espe - cially of the so-called '' orthodox '' sonnet .

		So strong was this impulse that the sonnetteering fashion in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day disdained the more regular restraints of the sonnet quatorzain and connected with the sonnet-motive a great vari - ety of lyric forms .

		Hence , among the minor sonnetteers , the mixed series , like Lodge 's '' Phillis '' and
J. C.	PERSON	's '' Alcilia , '' where lyric and canzon and ode are intermingled with qua - torzains , impress the reader as a less conven - tional and a more natural and taking develop - ment of the idea of a poetic-sequence than the more regular and artificial cycles of
Daniel	PERSON	and of
Giles Fletcher	PERSON	.

		The Elizabethan sonnet , in short , is to be studied in connection with the other lyric poetry of the period , and when a comparison is instituted between the modern sonnet and the Elizabethan , the differing char - acteristics of the entire lyric inspiration of both periods , as well as the differing laws of sonnet - structure in each , must be duly regarded .

		It is to aid us in such comparisons and such general - izations , not to mention the undistraught pleas - ure of the lover and reader of the choice old poetry of
England	LOCATION	, that such collections as the present , representing a definite literary kind in a definite literary period , are of especial value .

		In addition to a short but highly sympathetic and graceful
General Introduction	ORGANIZATION	, the editor has prefixed to each sequence a separate Intro - duction , all conceived in admirable spirit , and supplying in compact form such apparatus and commentary as is indispensable to the modern reader .

		THE GROWTH OF BRITISH POLICY .

		* Four of the prominent historians who have died within the past two years were distinc - tively patriotic writers .

		Whether it was von Treitschke or von Sybel describing the origin of Prussian hegemony , or
Froude	PERSON	defending the uprising of the English against Papal control , or
Seeley	PERSON	explaining the growth of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	, the work was national in its informing purpose .

		Doubtless the Prussians were truer lovers of their science than the Englishmen , but when they wrote they wrote as Prussians .

		THE HISTORY OF THE FOREIGN POLICY OF GREAT BRIT - .

		AIN .

		By
Montagu Burrows	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, As for
Seeley	PERSON	, Professor
Prothero	PERSON	, in a memoir prefixed to his essay on '' The Growth of Brit - ish Policy , '' says '' he was a good citizen , with a high sense of political responsibility , '' and that his aim in his lectures and addresses was '' to foster an enthusiasm for the British state . ''

		This constant aim may heighten the interest of his books ; and under the control of so broad a thinker as
Seeley	PERSON	was , it may not de - tract from the value of the work .

		But how dangerous it is to less clear heads may be observed in the pages of Professor
Burrows	PERSON	, author of '' The History of the Foreign Policy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' whose purely British and insular view of the world 's affairs would be irritating were it not so naive and childlike .

		Professor
Seeley	PERSON	calls his work an essay and not a history .

		In it he has sought to discuss British policy in its formative period , believing that as the policy of a modern Great Power it arrived at maturity about the close of the seven - teenth century .

		He has chosen the accession of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	as the point of departure , for dur - ing
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign , by a combination of happy chances , the foundations of a
Great Britain	LOCATION	were laid .

		As one reads chapter after chapter of this work , one is impressed with the unity of thought which is maintained , the com - prehensive grasp in which the varying threads of European diplomatic affairs are held .

		There is only a single fault to be found with the method , and that is the somewhat tedious itera - tion of the same statement .

		Had this been avoided , many pages might have been gained for a fuller presentation of the underlying eco - nomic causes .

		The importance of these causes Professor
Seeley	PERSON	himself acknowledges when , in speaking of the Revolution of
1688	DATE	, he re - marks : '' In whichever direction we look we find ourselves in the midst of economic phe - nomena . ''

		And if one compares his work with that of Professor
Burrows	PERSON	, one observes how much more complete it is than the latter in this respect .

		Professor
Burrows	PERSON	fails to mention even the Navigation Acts .

		Professor
Seeley	PERSON	does not seek to bring to light new facts : he attempts to place familiar facts in more intelligible relations to one an - other .

		His treatment of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's reign is unusually enlightening .

		The capital fact of her earlier years as queen was the triumph of the Counter-Reformation between
1564	DATE	and
1585	DATE	.

		Had not
Elizabeth	PERSON	strenuously adhered to her policy of peace , of leaving all questions unde - cided , and had she put herself at the head of a Protestant League , she would , thinks Professor
Seeley	PERSON	, have been defeated .

		Meanwhile the danger from the North steadily decreased as
Scotland	LOCATION	became more Protestant , and at the same time more jealous of French interference .

		A union of sympathies grew up which was the prophecy of the closer political union of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .

		And on the side of the continent the outlook was not so dark as it might appear , because while Philip II .

		remained
Duke of Burgundy	ORGANIZATION	there could be no true love in the hearts of patriotic Frenchmen for
Spain	LOCATION	, and the peace of
Cateau	LOCATION	- Cambresis could not seriously threaten Protes - tantism .

		Moreover , as
England	LOCATION	had lost her continental frontier during
Mary	PERSON	's reign , and as
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, not being herself of the royal caste , refused to marry or to pursue a narrow dynastic policy , the new
Great Britain	LOCATION	had a period of quiet , healthful growth , compara - tively free from foreign entanglements .

		Since her enemy was
Spain	LOCATION	, she also received that impulse toward ihe sea which with her island position determined her future greatness .

		By the time when
James I.	PERSON	mounted the throne she was strong enough safely to hold aloof from European struggles .

		Professor
Seeley	PERSON	regards the Counter-Refor - mation not as a reaction predominantly , but as a distinct reform movement , to be placed side by side with the others which began at
Pisa	LOCATION	in
1409	DATE	.

		When the last session of the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	had been held , and the church had been reformed , the historical continuity was all on the side of the old church .

		The reformed churches had henceforth to justify their seces - sion .

		They had appealed to a council , and a council had been given them : what more could they claim ?

		Is not Professor
Seeley	PERSON	wrong , however , when he declares '' never since has the Reformation recovered the ground it lost so unexpectedly in those years '' -LRB- from
1564	DATE	to 1585 -RRB- ?

		Consid - ering the matter strictly on its religious side , perhaps this may be true ; but politically the rise of
Prussia	LOCATION	to the leadership of the
German Empire	ORGANIZATION	has given Protestantism a strength it did not possess at any time in the sixteenth cen - tury .

		One of the most interesting of Professor
Seeley	PERSON	's lines of thought relates to the Haps - burg marriage policy , adopted because of the immense success consequent upon the marriage of Maximilian of
Austria	LOCATION	to
Mary of Burgundy	ORGANIZATION	, and the marriage of their heir
Philip	LOCATION	to
Joan	PERSON	, heiress of the dominions of Ferdinand and Isa - bella .

		He regards
Philip Second	ORGANIZATION	's marriage
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 to
Mary Tudor	PERSON	as not merely
Charles Fifth	PERSON	's revenge for the divorce , but as a Hapsburg con - quest of
England	LOCATION	, a conquest which reconciled
Charles	PERSON	to the abandonment of the empire to Ferdinand in
1555	DATE	.

		The Revolution of
1688	DATE	Professor
Seeley	PERSON	considers not as a mere incident in the consti - tutional and dynastic history of
England	LOCATION	, but as an event of European significance , a piece of grand strategy in
William	LOCATION	's historic struggle against
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		He believes it may prop - erly be said to have begun in
1670	DATE	with the Treaty of
Dover	LOCATION	, and to have been concluded with the
Peace of Ryswick	ORGANIZATION	in
1697	DATE	.

		Further , he thinks the
Stuart James	PERSON	was expelled quite as much because he was French in education and policy as because he was Catholic , an un - happy consequence of the marriage of
Charles I.	PERSON	and
Henrietta Maria	PERSON	.

		It is curious to find the English taken to task in those days , as the French are now , for polit - ical fickleness .

		Professor
Seeley	PERSON	recalls the saying of Torci : '' The English are a nation dont la legerete est connue ; Us changent sou - vent d'idees . ''

		A few words must be given to the work of Professor
Burrows	PERSON	, who , as has been intimated already , is a convinced believer in the right - eousness of all British deeds .

		To him ,
England	LOCATION	has been `` the visible champion of International Law , '' who '' found her duties to her own sub - jects correspond with her duties to her neigh - bors . ''

		The beautiful way in which the British spirit of entire self-abnegation was chastened by glimpses of the main chance is elucidated by our author when he comes to the French Revolution .

		He says : '' It fell once more to the lot of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to be summoned , unwillingly summoned , to the front for the purpose of administering the
International Law of Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope .

		The call was explicit ; but it none the less rep - resented the vital interests of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It was not only that the vast majority of the people felt a gen - uine disgust at the principles which issued in the hor - rors of the French Revolution , and a profound sympa - thy for the oppressed nations which fell under the French yoke ; they were convinced that in fighting for others the British were also fighting for themselves .

		This con - viction nerved every arm and inspired every sacrifice . ''

		Professor
Burrows	PERSON	does not tell us how long it took the British after the war had begun to introduce the notion into their heads that they were fighting for themselves .

		Perhaps it was only after they seized
South Africa	LOCATION	to hold in trust for the Dutch , or after they had succeeded in monopolizing the commerce of the seas .

		Occasionally he seems to suspect that there may have been on the irrational continent , or in
America	LOCATION	, a different view of the situation ; but he covers these lapses from perspicacity with a mantle of sweet charity .

		Professor
Burrows	PERSON	finds the bombardment of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	by the British fleet in
1807	DATE	, and the slaughter of two thousand unoffending citi - zens for the purpose of seizing the Danish fleet , '' a most dextrous stroke , '' and further defends it by reference to a legendary secret article of the
Treaty of Tilsit	ORGANIZATION	.

		The British Orders in
Council	ORGANIZATION	, too , which enabled them '' to concen - trate the trade of the world in their own hands , '' were quite right , because '' those who were the universal paymasters , and were drawing by hundreds of millions on posterity for this pur - pose , should at least have the power of paying interest to the national creditors . ''

		Professor
Burrows	PERSON	quotes in support of his view Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's admission that this policy toward neu - trals was necessary , and is a little surprised that the gallant Captain at the same time blames the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	for hav - ing tamely submitted for so many years to such reasonable requirements .

		He perhaps does not understand martial ethics and logic , according to which all parties are simultaneously and gloriously justified in punching one another 's heads .

		No fault can be found with Professor
Bur	PERSON	- rows 's sense of humor when he can speak of the
Irish Union	LOCATION	as brought to pass '' by the re - sources of genius at the hands of
Chatham	LOCATION	. ''

		This remark is delicious when we call to mind the means by which an Irish Parliamentary majority was gained , and which Lord Corn - wallis , one of the principal actors , called `` this dirty business '' and '' the shocking task im - posed on me . ''

		There are certain errors and omissions in this book which seem to argue haste at the least .

		For example , this is the description of the out - break of war between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in
1793	DATE	: '' To put it shortly they -LSB- the French -RSB- overran and annexed
Holland	LOCATION	, and on the re - monstrance of the British minister , declared war . ''

		Again , Professor
Burrows	PERSON	says that '' Prussian troops had been beaten at
Auster	PERSON	- litz when combined with those of
Austria	LOCATION	. ''

Oct. 1	DATE	, ORIGINS AND MEANINGS OF DECORATIVE ART .

		* '' To show that delineations have an individ - uality and a life-history which can be studied quite irrespectively of their artistic merit , '' is one of Professor
Haddon	PERSON	's objects in writing '' Evolution in Art '' ; to show by specific cases the method to be pursued in such study , is an - other .

		The book bristles with suggestive points .

		That artistic patterns or decorations have a '' life-history , '' that they are born , develop , pass through senility , and die , is a startling but true thought .

		The infancy and the senility of a given pattern often vary so profoundly as to be hardly recognized for one and the same .

		Who , uninstructed , sees at once the crocodile pattern worked out in detail on the curious arrows from
Torres Strait	LOCATION	?

		Who , unless he makes a comparison of specimens , recognizes the frigate-bird head in the pretty running spirals on the handles of the lime-spatulas , or the human faces on the wooden belts from
British New Guinea	LOCATION	?

		Decorative art , to be understood , must be studied as faunas are studied geographically .

		The same decorative design may come about in different ways in different regions .

		It is only when we study it in all its relations to climate , products , materials , tools , technique , life condi - tions , that we may be sure of its origin and of its development .

		Man has been constrained to artistic effort by four needs : Art , Information , Wealth , Re - ligion .

		Each gives rise to art forms .

		Upon any art form , once born , two forces operate : suggestion , which dynamically initiates and modifies ; and expectancy , which tends to con - serve unchanged what already exists .

		Mr.
Haddon	PERSON	illustrates the results of these needs as acted upon by these forces .

		Taking first the art products of a limited field British
New Guinea	LOCATION	, he sketches its main features in elu - cidation of his proposition .

		He then selects examples from every clime .

		These he studies first , to indicate the material out of which man makes designs and patterns ; and second , to illustrate the fact that transformation of objective originals into aesthetic conceptions is not confined to one people , but is common to mankind .

		designs , our author makes use of a series of recent terms in part of his own suggestion which are convenient .

		Decorative designs are either skenomorphs , physicomorphs , or bio - morphs .

		/ Skenomorphs are decorative trans - formation and transference of originally neces - sary and non-ornamental technic characters .

		Thus , a late bronze axe may bear ornamental lines , which imitate the cord fastenings by which it was previously joined to its handle ; decorations on pottery may be the reproduction of the appearance of the basket-work , which preceded earthen vessels .

		PhysicomorpTis are decorative designs representing objects or oper - ations in the physical world .

		The rain-cloud of the
Moki	ORGANIZATION	, the zigzag lightning symbol of many peoples , are examples .

		BiomorpTis are decorative patterns drawn from living things , and ma.yloephyllom.orpks -LRB- vegetal -RRB- , zoomorp hs -LRB- animal -RRB- , or anthropomorphs -LRB- human -RRB- , in their origin .

		When such decorative designs are not simple and pure , they may be called heteromorphs , and these may be either hetero - morphs of skenomorphs , of biomorphs , or of skeno-biomorphs .

		After a study of the reasons for which ob - jects are decorated , in which weight is given to each of the needs to be satisfied Art ,
Infor	ORGANIZATION	- mation , Wealth , Religion , Professor Had - don gives some practical suggestions upon the scientific method of studying decorative art .

		Recognizing that patterns are not freely evolved by savage peoples , but that they are suggested by some object , the student must first seek for the source of the suggestion ; he must then trace the development which may be upward specialization , degeneration , or selection .

		Orig - inated and developed , the design must be traced in its geographical wanderings a task of great delicacy , requiring much judgment .

		In such study , direct information from the maker or user of the object is vastly important , but not always accessible ; often induction and inter - pretation alone can be used .

		The author 's material is drawn from many authorities , of varying value .

		Most of his facts are already known to the ethnographer .

		But he presents them suggestively so as to arouse much new thought ; he brings out a useful no - menclature ; he displays such earnestness as to kindle enthusiasm and raise up workers in a field where workers are much needed ; he also suggests the safe and useful method to be fol - lowed if real advance in the subject is to be S ained -

		THE DIAL 191 STUDIES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A writer in a recent number of THE DIAL -LRB- Pro- fessor
J. J. Halsey	PERSON	,
May 1 , 1896	DATE	, p. 268 -RRB- , says : '' American national history can not be finally writ - ten until the field of the local life be thoroughly investigated and the material classified . ''

		To the truth of this dictum , American historical students will generally testify .

		One of the most satisfactory phases of the activity in historical studies , now evi - dent among us , is the tendency to systematically develop this local field .

		Sectional , state , and local historical societies are busy searching the uttermost corners of their several domains , and pouring out upon us a mass of original material hitherto exist - ing only in manuscript form , and for the most part wholly inaccessible to students .

		The patriotic - hereditary societies , having emerged from the mildly - exciting stage of organization , are now proving themselves useful factors in civilization by editing and publishing historical documents , often of con - siderable importance .

		Several of the racial organ - izations are doing most admirable special work of this character , prominent among them , the na - tional Scotch-Irish , Huguenot , and Jewish Publica - tion societies , the
Holland Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, and the Pennsylvania-German Society .

		The county and town historians are unusually busy , these days ; and the often valuable newspaper '' annuals '' and '' anniversary numbers '' are not to be ignored , for many of them contain most excellent historical ma - terial , collected by competent hands .

		Last , but not least , the genealogists , who have of late become so numerous among us as to form a considerable per - centage of the daily patrons of reference libraries the country over , are doing their part in shedding light upon dark places , firmly convinced , with Mac - aulay , that the study of a nation 's life is but the sum of the stories of individual careers .

		Now and then the story of an individual career is of prime importance to the general historian .

		Parkman and
Fiske	PERSON	, for instance , have been partic - ularly skilful in their use of such .

		Warmly would Parkman have welcomed ''
Pote	PERSON	's Journal , '' which has just been given to the world ; and what a wealth of illustration he would have found in it for his Half Century of Conflict . ''

		Of the inner history of
King George	ORGANIZATION	's War -LRB- 1744-48 -RRB- , we have had an insufficiency of records .

		colonies contributed to the army chest , but it was , in
North America	LOCATION	, essentially a war of New En - glanders against the Canadian French , for the ob - jective points were
Cape Breton	LOCATION	,
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and northern
New England	LOCATION	.

		The French garrison at
Louisbourg	LOCATION	had news of the declaration of war -LRB-
March 15 , 1744	DATE	-RRB- a full month before
Boston	LOCATION	re - ceived its information by a
Glasgow	LOCATION	ship .

		It was easy , therefore , for the French to surprise and cap - ture the English post of Canso , and send its garri - son as prisoners to
Louisbourg	LOCATION	.

		Annapolis Royal , the only English fortification now left in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, was sharply beset by the enemy , who was aided by Indians and rebellious Acadians .


New England	LOCATION	soon sent reinforcements thither ; but when supplies were forwarded to them in
May , 1745	DATE	, in the schooners `` Montague '' and `` Sunflower , '' a French marauding party captured the vessels and their crews , at their anchorage in
Annapolis Basin	LOCATION	, sold or divided the cargoes , and sent the prisoners overland to
Quebec	LOCATION	.


William Pote , Jr.	PERSON	, a man of spirit and enterprise , was master of the '' Mon - tague , '' and during his captivity of over two years -LRB- he was captured
May 17 , 1745	DATE	, and released
July 30 , 1747	DATE	-RRB- kept an elaborate journal of his daily experiences .

		Smuggling this treasure through the lines , when finally exchanged ,
Pote	PERSON	appears to have given the journal to his superior officer ,
John Henry Bastide	PERSON	, chief-engineer of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	; and the plump little manuscript book remained in the pos - session of the latter 's family for many years .

		Later , it drifted to the English colony at
Geneva	LOCATION	,
Switzer	PERSON	- land , and in
August , 1890	DATE	, was there acquired by
John Fletcher Hurst	PERSON	, to whom we owe its resurrec - tion and present sumptuous publication .

		The importance of the narrative will be appre - ciated when it is remembered that but two other accounts of this notable captivity have before seen print , and they but brief tracts by fellow-prisoners , which do not cover so long a period or give such full and interesting details .

		The editor , Mr.
Hurst	PERSON	, does not overstate the case in saying : '' While some accounts of the war make mention of
Pote	PERSON	as a participant , and finally a captive , it is now first known , through the discovery of his complete Jour - nal , that he kept a minute record of his experiences , and of the important events of the war .

		It supplies many missing links , and reconciles contradictions which had hitherto defied the student of American Colonial His - tory .

		In addition , it throws full light on entire depart - ments of that important struggle between the French and the English for the possession , not of
Canada	LOCATION	alone , but of
North America	LOCATION	in general .

		It records incursions related to Pote by the captives themselves ; gives mem - oranda of marriages , illnesses , deaths , and many other minute facts relating to the captives ; and contains the best and fullest account of
Donahew	ORGANIZATION	's exploit in
Tat	ORGANIZATION	- megouche Bay .

		There is a strong genealogical element pervading the whole narrative .

		Indeed , the latter part of the Journal is occupied with a list of the persons who died during the two years of the captivity .

		This hitherto unknown treasury of genealogy is of absorbing interest and value to
New England	LOCATION	families , so many of which were represented in this large band of captives . ''

		192 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Hurst	PERSON	supplies an introductory Account of the Journal itself ;
Victor H. Paltsits	PERSON	, of
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	, furnishes an Historical Introduction , with copious foot-notes and genealogical appendices ; and several old manuscripts , maps , views , and portraits are effectively reproduced for the volume .

		A fine large map of '' The Northern English Colonies , together with the French neighbouring Settle - ments , '' drawn by
Charles Morris	PERSON	for the use of Governor
Shirly	PERSON	in the subsequent French and In - dian War , and dated
August 16 , 1749	DATE	, has been rendered in facsimile from the original in
Lenox Library	LOCATION	, and is folded within separate covers .

		Editor , contributors , and publishers have severally well performed their parts , the result being an important contribution to American colonial history , which is at the same time an admirable specimen of bookmaking .

		It is unfortunate , however , that the editor should have adopted upon his title-page a term for the hostilities of 1744-48 which is now discarded by historians .

		To avoid confusion it has been found necessary by them to designate this affair as
King George	LOCATION	's War , reserving for the ulti - mate struggle of 1754-63 the title , French and Indian War .

		This neglect to properly designate the earlier campaign will lead to confusion among bibliographers and historical students .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's great sectional history , '' The Winning of the West , '' is progressing apace .

		In the fourth volume , now before us , he carries forward the story from
1791	DATE	to
1807	DATE	; beginning with the uprising of the
Northwestern Indians	ORGANIZATION	, who at first defeated
St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	and Harmar , and were in turn effectually quelled by
Anthony Wayne	PERSON	, the volume closes '' with the acquisition and exploration of the vast region that lay beyond the
Mississippi	LOCATION	. ''

		In former volumes , the author dealt with the explora - tion and first settlement of the trans-Alleghany region , the crude formative period when the
West	LOCATION	- erners , almost wholly neglected by the tide-water colonists , broke the paths and wrested from a sav - age foe the wilderness beyond the mountains ; he tells us , in this volume , how the West at last forged to the front , and began the acquisition of that polit - ical power which it has since so effectively wielded .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	tells us how
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and
Ohio	LOCATION	became states , and
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Mississippi	LOCATION	territories ; how the great stream of permanent settlers followed the over-mountain paths worn by
Boone	PERSON	and other wilderness hunters , who in turn were swept by the incoming tide to the region beyond the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, where they could live in peace ; how the
West	LOCATION	came dangerously near separating from the
Union	LOCATION	, in its uneasiness over the Spanish ownership of the mouth of the Missis - sippi ; how men like
Clark	PERSON	and
Wilkinson	PERSON	and
Innes	PERSON	, jealous of the
East	LOCATION	, coquetted with foreign powers for the securing of political separation , until the final acquisition of
Louisiana	LOCATION	and the Far West put a stop to this plotting .

		We learn , in this volume , of the great land speculations which were curses to the early West ; we are told of
Burr	PERSON	's conspiracy , of the several wars with the Creeks of the South and the swarming Algonkins of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, of the great exploring expeditions to and through the far West those of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, and
Pike	LOCATION	.

		What is more , we are advised not only of the deeds of the leaders , we are made familiar with the daily lives and aspirations of the common settlers , the half-hunter , half-farmer men of the little log cabins in the back - woods clearings , the humble villagers of
Lexington	LOCATION	and
Louisville	LOCATION	and
Nashville	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	not only has a broad grasp upon the main facts , the fruit of serious toil in original research among old records in manuscript and print : but his own life upon the frontier , under somewhat similar condi - tions , has given him an intimate knowledge of the earlier borderer , enabling him by rare insight and gift of phrase to paint for us a graphic picture of wilderness life , which is one of the greatest charms of '' The Winning of the West . ''

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	illustrates , in this otherwise admir - able volume , the inadvisability of attempting too much .

		The president of the
New York Police	ORGANIZATION	Com - mission can have but little leisure for historical investigation or historical writing .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	did the greater part of his study of the West pre - vious to taking upon himself his present harassing office ; it is only in putting his material together that he shows haste and sometimes negligence .

		Some day he will wish to revise , in the present volume , the not infrequent evidences of an overcrowded office-holding historian , the occasional crudities of expression in the text , the often slip-shod foot-notes , slight errors of statement , and careless proof-reading .

		These are minor defects , but Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	is too good a book-maker not by this time to be grieved at them .

		There is a useful map of exploration routes , and the usual good index ; the concluding volume of the work should , and doubtless will , contain a general index to all .

		Public attention is just now being drawn to the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	's land reservation in
Ohio	LOCATION	, the centennial of which has recently been celebrated in
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		The colonizing experiences of Gen.
Moses Cleaveland	PERSON	in what was popularly called ''
New Connecticut	LOCATION	, '' a hundred years ago , are not referred to by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, although they were of prime importance ; neither does he say any - thing concerning the rival reservation between the
Miami	LOCATION	,
Scioto	LOCATION	, and
Ohio	LOCATION	rivers , the
Virginia Mili	LOCATION	- tary District .

		A few lines summarizing the story of each enterprise would have been advisable even in so general an account as '' The Winning of the West . ''

		Concerning the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, much has been written in detail ; the
Western Reserve Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, at
Cleveland	LOCATION	, has done its part in enlightening general historians concerning it , and the
Western Reserve University	ORGANIZATION	helps to perpetuate its name .

		Of the inner history of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Mil - itary District , less is known .

		Burton 's '' Notes on the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The
St. Clair Papers	ORGANIZATION	, ''
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 and ''
Cutler	PERSON	's Memoirs , '' are accessible to students ; but tbese give us only a partial view the
St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	view .

		In truth , there was a desperate struggle for supremacy , between the founder of colonization at
Manchester	LOCATION	and
Chillicothe	LOCATION	, General
Nathaniel Massie	PERSON	, and the governor of the
Northwest Terri	LOCATION	- tory ,
General Arthur St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Massie	PERSON	side of the contest is now for the first time presented in the life and letters of
Nathaniel Massie	PERSON	, prepared by that pioneer 's grandson , a citizen of
Chillicothe	LOCATION	, and published by the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a house which has for many years done yeoman service for the cause of Western history , often with no other recompense than the commendation of students in this field .

		An important chapter in the story of
Ohio	LOCATION	will now have to be re-written , thus remind - ing us of the truth of the familiar dictum that each generation is obliged to write its own history , be - cause either of new material discovered , or a change in the mental attitude of the people .

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's '' With the Fathers '' is a collection , within covers , of a '' baker 's dozen '' of his fugitive essays on various topics connected with American history and polity , originally published in the leading magazines .

		The range is wide , chro - nologically , extending from '' How the British left
New York	LOCATION	, '' down to the timely query , '' Is Sound Finance Possible under Popular Government ? ''

		The
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , the third-term tradition , Wash - ington 's inauguration , the Know-Nothing move - ment , and
Franklin	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	, are among the sub - jects treated .

		Our author throws no new light upon these , and could not be expected to do so , for it is well-threshed straw ; he has opinions , however , and , although we may not always agree with his conclu - sions , he is always interestingly readable .

		Uphold - ing the extreme jingo view of the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , he maintains that the United States should '' not permit any such contest -LSB- the attempted transfer of the political sovereignty of any portion of American soil , whatsoever , to European powers -RSB- to result in the increase of European power or influence on this continent . ''

		We should be ready , he thinks , being strong enough to do so , and might , he considers , makes right , to uphold this position '' with force of arms . ''

		The professor evidently has inside infor - mation , thus far unknown to the members of the
Boundary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, who are as yet undecided , when he unqualifiedly asserts that
Venezuela	LOCATION	is the rightful owner of '' the area now claimed arbitrarily , and with no proof submitted , by
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		In the matter of our financial policy , to which two papers are devoted , the author is a gold-standard man ; although what he brands as fiscal heresies sometimes win in popular elections , he has firm reli - ance on '' the hard common-sense of the people , who in their own good time and way have heretofore adjusted all difficulties wisely . ''

		The index is well made .

		We have in Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's '' The Making of
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania '' a state history quite out of the common .


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	was from earliest times a meeting - place of many peoples , representing many creeds and widely divergent interests .


New England	LOCATION	and the Southern colonies were planted almost exclu - sively by Englishmen ; but in the middle group there was a mingling of foreigners of many sorts and conditions , and nowhere was the variety so great as in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Dutch , Swedes , Germans , Scotch-Irish , and Welsh united with the English ; between the Puritan solidarity of
New England	LOCATION	and the strongly-contrasted circles of Churchmen and English Dissenters of the South , there dwelt in more or less harmony , in
Penn	LOCATION	's domain , a curious mix - ture of Quakers , Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Lu - therans , Reformers of many kinds , Mennonites ,
Dunkards	ORGANIZATION	, and Moravians .

		All of these strangely - commingled folk , each community in its own way , had a share in the making of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		At first in separate groups , with sharply-defined character - istics and aims , often pulling apart though linked together , they in time were fairly merged in a great commonwealth .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	has , for the most part in good temper and with sound judgment , told us the story of each group , how '' they all acted and re-acted on each other , changed sides in politics , and produced movements and counter-currents which make the history of the state extremely varied and interesting , and at the same time rather difficult to trace . ''

		It is a timely work in a comparatively untilled field , for the study of the elements which have made us a distinct people has thus far not progressed beyond the tentative stage .

		If allowances are made for ill - concealed bias , here and there , the book will be helpful to students of history and sociology .

		The author has not forgotten the necessary index .

		BKIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A sober and ^ r * Edward
Channing	PERSON	's `` The
United	ORGANIZATION	rational history of States of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the
United	ORGANIZATION	states .

		an excellent addition to the useful `` Cambridge Historical Series , '' a set of concise manuals on the history of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	and its chief colonies and conquests , already described in our columns .

		Dr.
Channing	PERSON	's little book contains more actual political and social history , and should leave the reader with a juster knowledge of the elements and growth of our national organism , than most works on the subject of twice its bulk .

		It strikes us as , all in all , the best manual of the kind yet published .

		Its judicial tone places it in marked contrast with text-books of the old flamboyant pat - tern , which have undoubtedly done much to breed in our people that strain of '' jingoism '' which makes them lend a ready ear to the rants of our Congressional Bobadils .

		It is pretty difficult to rid the '' average man '' -LRB- whom we perhaps take , as Mr.
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	thought , too seriously in this coun - try -RRB- of the notion that the prime duty of an Amer - 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ican historian writing American history is to claim everything and concede nothing , and to punctuate his recital with war-whoops .

		Dr.
Channing	PERSON	's aim is `` to trace the steps by which the American people and its peculiar type of federal state have developed out of such heterogeneous and unpromising mate - rials for nation-building as were to be found in the English-American Colonies in
1760	DATE	. ''

		The space gained by omitting the familiar details as to battles and campaigns has been usefully devoted to the explanation of the deeper causes of the Revolution , and to the detailed story of the period between the close of the Revolutionary War and
Madison	PERSON	's inauguration .

		The work extends to the end of the Civil War .

		The
Virginia	LOCATION	Resolves -LRB- 1769 -RRB- , the Declaration of Independence , the Articles of Con - federation , the Constitution , and a serviceable Biblio - graphical Note , are appended ; and there are some good maps specially compiled by the author .

		vear attracted widespread attention and interest not only lays claim to an ancestry through the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	reaching back to Apostolic times , but possesses a history of far more than ordinary interest in her development in this Western hemisphere .

		The materials for this history are to be found principally in numerous volumes of documents collated by the late Dr. Hawks and the present Bishop of
Iowa	LOCATION	, who have successively filled the position of historiographer of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		`` The results of their editorial labors have been freely drawn upon by the Rev.
Charles C. Tiffany	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	,
Archdeacon	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, in his con - tribution to the excellent series of
American Church Histories	ORGANIZATION	published by
The Christian Literature Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Tiffany	PERSON	's work is comprised in
Volume VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the series , and bears the title , '' A History of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States of America	LOCATION	. ''

		The subject is a broad one and is broadly treated .

		The history natur - ally divides itself into two distinct parts : The His - tory of the English Church in the Colonies -LRB-
1607	DATE	-
1785	DATE	-RRB- , and The Protestant Episcopal Church in the
United States	LOCATION	-LRB- 1789-1895 -RRB- .

		In the latter portion of the work its excellence is especially noticeable in the marshalling of its facts , the easy style of its narration , the defining of the various parties and schools of thought existing in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and the presentation of the institutions which best exhibit the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's life and progress .

		In a work of so much merit and such dignified appearance it is not a little surprising to find such misprints as '' disas - terous '' and '' incredibel , '' and to find Bishop Stone 's name given twice as `` Storer , '' Bishop
James Har	PERSON	- vey
Otey	PERSON	as ``
James N. Otey	PERSON	, '' and
Bishop Johnston	PERSON	as ''
Johnson	PERSON	. ''

		Some repetitions might have been avoided to the advantage of the book .

		That the author has a few pet phrases , which he is fond of introducing , is evident , and perhaps excusable , though it jars slightly on the reader 's nerves to find the phrase '' a name to conjure with '' -LRB- now gener - ally employed as political slang -RRB- introduced a second time .

		But it seems hypercritical to direct attention to these defects in a book which is otherwise com - mendable .

		It is rich in appendices and tables , and is well indexed .

		Altogether , the Protestant Epis - copal Church may congratulate herself upon the good showing she is permitted to make in this ecclesiastico-historical symposium .

		A national Tbe often - propounded question English school whether there is , or ever has been , a of music .

		national English musical school or style , may now be considered as definitely answered in the affirmative by Mr.
Frederick G. Crowest	PERSON	, through '' The Story of British Music '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		The work reveals the fact that no country neither
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, nor
Italy	LOCATION	has so ancient an origin in music as has
England	LOCATION	, or a more glorious record ; in its far-off days , En - gland was really a more distinctively musical nation than any other , and also more musically character - istic than it is to-day .

		The '' story '' told in this volume , although ending where
England	LOCATION	's musical history is commonly counted as only fairly begin - ning at the close of the fifteenth century occu - pies four hundred interesting pages .

		So diligent has been the author 's research that he has gathered together and reproduced some splendid proofs of a pure
First Period	ORGANIZATION	school ; has shown how
England	LOCATION	's musical disputationists and theoretical writers stood in the first rank ; how secular music , and that greater art , sacred harmony , blossomed and grew ; how musical establishments and systems existing to-day were founded and put upon workable footings all prior to the times of the Tudors .

		Leaving his subject just on the threshold , as it were , we may well look forward to Mr.
Crowest	PERSON	's promised con - tinuation of his story in another volume , when we may expect to meet , in the Elizabethan age , musi - cians as great in their way as were
Shakespeare , Bacon	ORGANIZATION	,
Halley	LOCATION	, and
Frobisher	PERSON	in theirs .

		One who knows nothing of musical art may follow the narra - tive with great interest and profit ; but the trained musician will find in this volume a special and unique value , owing to its illustrations of antique instrument and its copies of old melodies , harmonies , and systems of notation .

		A trinity of famous Scots .

		The reasons for the existence of the somewhat liberal collections of vol - umes devoted to great commanders , great statesmen , and divers sets of men of letters , find more available exemplification perhaps in the indomitable Scot than in many another less likely unit .

		The latest additions to the '' Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- deal with a suffi - ciently characteristic trio
John Knox	PERSON	,
Robert Burns	PERSON	, and
Hugh Miller	PERSON	; and , in biographies of a hundred and fifty pages each , present certain dif - ficulties .

		Of the three ,

A. Taylor Innes	PERSON	, has been brought much more ade -

		THE DIAL 195 quately within the scope and nature of what the design of the series would seem to be .

		There is a judicious use of material , even a dynamic skill here and there in the arrangement of it ; and the result is readable without being in the least slovenly .

		In the case of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Gabriel Setoun	PERSON	has been less happy in his special outlook .

		The Scottish genius for controversy asserts itself ; and
Burns	PERSON	, as often before in his posthumous vicissitudes , has to suffer .

		Mr.
Setoun	PERSON	's intentions are plainly the best in the world , but he has ended , unfortunately , unlike his subject 's fame , by confining himself to one side of the Cheviots .

		A little more attention to broader movements in literature than to mere biographical differences of opinion , and he might have gratified himself by a consideration of Burns not as a paro - chial but as a European product .

		The least com - mendable of the three lives is that of
Hugh Miller	PERSON	, in which Mr.
W. Keith Leask	PERSON	also has been need - lessly controversial , and incidentally does not get his proportions well fused .

		The volume on
Knox	PERSON	has an apparently careful index , and that on
Miller	PERSON	has a bibliography ; the
Burns	ORGANIZATION	is without either .

		The museum has fought its way against all difficulties , until it stands recognized as one of the most important branches of the great University of which it forms a part .

		Its field-work has been most significant .

		Its explo - rations of
Tennessee	LOCATION	and
Ohio	LOCATION	mounds are models .

		The collections it possesses represent every part of the
United States	LOCATION	, and comprise interesting series from
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Central America	LOCATION	, and
Peru	LOCATION	.

		Through its agency the great
Serpent Mound	ORGANIZATION	in
Ohio	LOCATION	has been saved from destruction and preserved for all time .

		From its field-work and collections much lit - erature has already grown .

		Three sets of publica - tions are now in progress Annual Reports ,
Occa	LOCATION	- sional Papers , and Memoirs .

		The Annual Reports , in octavo form , have contained numerous valuable papers .

		Recently , however , they have been con - fined to business and statistical statements , while papers upon set subjects have been printed inde - pendently .

		Five such special papers have now ap - peared , the latest being Miss
Fletcher	PERSON	's important ' * Study of
Omaha	LOCATION	Music . ''

		For some time the Mu - seum has promised the publication of Memoirs .

		The first number of these has now appeared .

		It is a preliminary report of the explorations of the Mu - seum among the prehistoric ruins of
Copan	LOCATION	,
Hon	PERSON	- duras , during the years 18911895 .

		Since the time of
John Lloyd Stephens	PERSON	, these ruins have been among those most admired and visited in the
Isthu	LOCATION	- mian district .

		Dr.
Alfred P. Maudsley	PERSON	added much to the work of
Stephens	PERSON	and
Catherwood	ORGANIZATION	.

		The re - port before us carefully locates every ruin in the group , with maps and descriptions .

		Cute and good plates supplement the text .

		Professor
Putnam	PERSON	and his helpers are to be congratulated upon the mate - rial and quality of this their first quarto publication .

		Three branches Professor
William Bondy	PERSON	has con - of governmental tributed a substantial sum to the fund powers .

		Q g enera i information by the able and exhaustive manner in which he presents and discusses '' The Separation of Governmental Pow - ers . ''

		The book is the second number of Volume V. of '' Studies in History , Economics , and Public Law , '' a series which is ably edited by the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity
Faculty of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	in
Columbia Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sub - ject is considered historically , theoretically , and in the constitutions .

		The arrangement of the contents is thoroughly logical , and the presentation of the subject-matter is clear and concise .

		While there is no attempt at extended discussion of any phase of the subject , enough is said to inform the reader of the point which it is aimed to make , and the copious references and footnotes amply tell the rest .

		The governmental powers considered are , of course , the executive , the legislative , and the judicial .

		Mr.
Bondy	PERSON	asserts that in spite of the strong language used in the American constitutions with regard to the separation of governmental powers , '' there is not a single constitution in which some of the chief powers of government were not made dependent for their proper exercise upon the action of more than one of the governmental departments , and in which powers , historically or theoretically considered ex - ecutive , have not been exercised by the legislative and judicial departments ; in which powers consid - ered judicial have not been exercised by the legis - lative and executive departments ; and in which powers considered legislative in their nature have not been exercised by the executive and judicial departments . ''

		The book is well adapted for use by the student , by the professional man , and by the general reader .

		We have repeatedly spoken words of P 8e concerning the `` English Classics '' published from time to time by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The skill with which these texts are edited for school use , and the evident determination to treat them as literature rather than as material for historical annotation and philological analysis , are qualities that commend this series of books to progressive teachers .

		Five numbers have recently been added to the series : ''
Southey	PERSON	's Life of Nelson , '' edited by Mr.
E. L. Miller	PERSON	; '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' edited by Miss
Mary A. Jordan	PERSON	; Books I. and II .

		of '' Paradise Lost , '' edited by Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. ; the `` Sir Roger '' papers , edited by Mr.
D. 0	PERSON	.


S. Lowell	PERSON	; and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's `` Johnson , '' edited by Mr.
H. G. Buehler	PERSON	.

		All of these books are welcome for the excellence of their editing , and the Nelson is addi - tionally welcome as a comparative novelty in En - glish texts .

		Another highly meritorious book of this class is Mr.
W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	's second series of the Tennysonian '' Idylls '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , completing this edition of the work .

		For the '' Eclectic English Classics '' of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	not much may 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, be said .

		The work done upon these texts is so per - functory and inadequate that the editors are unwill - ing to let their names appear .

		Three volumes just issued contain '' The Princess , '' ''
Franklin	PERSON	's Auto - biography , '' and four books -LRB- 1 , 6 , 22 , 24 -RRB- of Pope 's '' Iliad . ''

		Messrs. Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have re - cently published three books for teachers of English .

		Miss
Lucy Tappan	PERSON	's '' Topical Notes on American Authors '' deals with eleven representative writers , is the outgrowth of several years of experience in teaching , and will be found helpful by other teach - ers .

		The other two books are editions of `` As You Like It '' and Irving 's '' Sketch Book , '' the former edited by Mr.
Homer B. Sprague	PERSON	, the latter by Mr.
James Chalmers	PERSON	.

		Allied with the above-named books in interest is the new '' Practical Rhetoric '' of Mr.
John D. Quackenbos	PERSON	, which aims to adopt '' the aesthetic as the true basis of literary criticism , '' and is published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the most useful volumes pub - ng .

		lhed the excellent International Education '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is Pro- fessor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	's book about `` Teaching the Language-Arts . ''

		It is the outgrowth of the author 's pedagogical teaching at the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, and is based upon a wide knowledge of the condi - tions that obtain in American education .

		The cen - tral idea of the treatment is the importance of the part played by imitation , conscious or unconscious , in the mental growth of the child ; and the book may almost be described as the application of this idea to the teaching of speech , reading , and composition .

		The author thus states the chief objects of his work : '' The claim to merit must rest on these particulars : First , the clear conception and description of speech , reading , and composition , as arts ; secondly , the large place assigned to use and wont , to models and imitation , and the small place to reflective art in teaching them ; and , thirdly , the grounding of the several teaching processes in the fundamental facts of human nature . ''

		The claim as thus stated may fairly be allowed , and it must be added that the discussion is admirably clear , besides being made interesting by all sorts of apposite illustrations , drawn from a wide range of reading that is by no means confined to educational lines .

		Every teacher of English in a primary or secondary school should study this book , and take to heart its fundamental thesis .

		German myth There are a number of books that and legend bear upon the subject-matter of Wag - in
Wagner	LOCATION	.

		ner > g O p erag > an -LRB- j we tn ; n k tne l atest is the best to be found in English .

		Miss
Jessie L. Weston	PERSON	's `` Legends of the Wagner Drama '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is a careful and in many respects satisfactory piece of work .

		It does not con - sider all of
Wagner	PERSON	's operas ; but the legends on which are founded the
Nibelungen Trilogy	ORGANIZATION	, Par - sifal , Tristan and Isolde ,
Lohengrin	LOCATION	, and
Tann	PERSON	- hauser , are discussed in some detail .

		As a rule , a sketch of each legend is given ; in the case of the
Nibelungen Trilogy	ORGANIZATION	, for instance ,
Miss Weston	LOCATION	gives abstracts of the Volsunga-saga , the Thidrek-saga , and the Nibelungen-lied .

		The main part of the treatment , however , consists of a discussion of the legend and of its treatment by
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Although not affecting the position of a specialist ,
Miss Wes	LOCATION	- ton has a very considerable acquaintance with the literature of the subject .

		From the standpoint of scholarship there are some adverse criticisms that might be made .

		The treatment of the proper names seems to show a lack of linguistic knowledge .

		We doubt the expediency of working so absolutely from
Simrock	LOCATION	.

		His book has run through many edition * , and is still of value ; but his descriptive treatment is rather confusing .

		There are other things that might be noted ; perhaps the main criticism would be that
Miss Weston	LOCATION	goes into the subject rather farther than the ordinary reader can follow her , and yet not always with the assured confidence and power of the scholar .

		But even in such case , the book will meet the wants of a large number of readers , and will serve as introduction to a very interesting subject .

		Memories of quaint Nanlucket .

		In his '' Quaint Nantucket '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , Mr.
William Root Bliss	PERSON	has collected many pleasant memorials of that storied island as it existed , or vegetated , for some two centuries before the present annual inva - sion of the ''
summer	DATE	boarder '' began .

		The sources of information drawn upon comprise the original town and court records , old letters , account-books , ships ' logs , and so on .

		These documents the author has freely '' scissored , '' the resulting spoils being then duly sifted and classified , and finally sewn to - gether on a thread of running comment and de - scription a style of book-making rendered familiar by the useful volumes on early
New England	LOCATION	life by Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bliss	PERSON	sets before us a good deal of quaint matter touching old Nan - tucket life and character , a very amusing chapter being one descriptive of '' Sea-Journals and Sea - Rovers . ''

		One of these ancient marines especially , a Captain
Peleg	PERSON	-LRB- pronounced '' Pillick '' -RRB-
Folger	PERSON	must have been an odd fish , even for
Nantucket	LOCATION	.

		He may have been the hero of the local stave '' Old Uncle Pillick he built him a boat On the b-a-a-ck side of
Nantucket	LOCATION	P'int ; He rolled up his trousers an ' set her afloat From the back side of
Nantucket	LOCATION	P'int '' But Mr.
Bliss	PERSON	does not say so .

		Captain
Peleg	PERSON	's log-book was , in
Nantucketese	LOCATION	, indeed a '' caution , '' chiefly from its gifted author 's habit of mixing up his daily records of fair winds and foul , '' sperma - ceties '' sighted and killed , and the like nautical and appropriate matters , with scraps of Latin and totally irrelevant moral reflections .

		His cheerful record of a day 's '' good catch , '' for instance , winds up with the doleful and uncalled-for motto , '' '' Death sum - mons all men to the silent grave '' ; while a few days later he piously writes : '' We have killed two Sper -

		THE DIAL 197 maceties .

		Now for home Boys !

		We have 70 bar - rels full in our Hold ex beneficia , divina . ''

		Cap - tain
Peleg	PERSON	's Latin habit was not , it seems , regarded with favor by his shipmates , one of whom scrawls irreverently in his magnum opus : '' Old Peleg Fol - ger is a
Num Scull	ORGANIZATION	for writing Latin .

		I fear he will be Offended with me for writing in his Book but I will Intercede in his behalf with
Anna Pitts	PERSON	to make up for ye same
Nathaniel Worth	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Bliss	PERSON	treats in other chapters of '' The Nantucket Indian , '' '' The Dominion of the Quakers , '' '' The Town 's Doings , '' ''
Nantucket	LOCATION	's School of Philoso - phers , '' etc. .

		The book is a capital one to while away a
summer	DATE	's visit to '' Quaint Nantucket . ''

		The excellent Shakespearian , Dr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	, has given , in a pretty volume entitled '' Shakespeare the Boy '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , an elaborate picture of the
Stratford	LOCATION	of the dramatist 's boyhood , and of the life and manners , especially the local life and manners , of the period .

		Next to nothing is absolutely known of the life of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most of the items com - posing his traditional biography rest on no basis of sound evidence .

		We may as well reconcile our - selves to that disagreeable fact .

		But by piecing together in detail the conditions that surrounded his boyhood , and especially those that peculiarly affected boys , we can form a faint general notion of what young
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in common with other
Strat	PERSON	- ford lads of his time and condition , might , could , would , or should have done during the second stage of his '' seven ages . ''

		Such a mosaic of
Stratford	LOCATION	boy-life Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	has given us .

		Drawing from trustworthy sources , he writes entertainingly of
Warwick	PERSON	and
Kenilworth Castles	LOCATION	,
Charlecqte Hall	PERSON	, of the
Stratford Guild	ORGANIZATION	, Corporation , and topog - raphy , of the
Stratford	LOCATION	schools , of the home life , games and sports , holidays , festivals , and fairs of the period , and so on .

		The text is freely strewn with quotations in point , largely from the dramatist 's own writings .

		The book is based on a series of four familiar articles written by Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	for the '' Youth 's Companion , '' two years ago .

		These pa - pers are now revised and enlarged to thrice their original compass , and a new fifth chapter has been added .

		Those who care least for the conjectural element in the book may well value it for its his - torical and descriptive interest .

		There are a num - ber of attractive woodcuts .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's Students of
Butler	PERSON	are much indebted subsidiary studies to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	for the admirable of
Bishop Butler	ORGANIZATION	.

		ed i tion o f the Bishop 's works which the old statesman a few months since gave to the world , and which was noticed at length in THE DIAL -LRB-
April 16 , 1896	DATE	-RRB- .

		Perhaps Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's tireless pen might well have rested , and spared itself the later labors of his '' Studies Subsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butler '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They will hardly add to the fame of the writer .

		They are evidently the fruit of the lifelong meditation of a subtle and laborious mind upon a favorite author .

		Without wishing to be impertinent , one is tempted to say that they are very much such papers as an able and conscientious Oxford '' Coach '' might fur - nish for the service of a promising candidate for honors .

		They abound in various material , yet one can not say that they contribute much to our knowl - edge of
Butler	PERSON	, or to the advance of Christian ethics or Christian theology .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is a brilliant financier , an able administrator , an accomplished parliamentarian , a splendid orator , a striking and interesting personality ; but he is not a profound thinker .

		His rhetoric is more copious than lucid , more vigorous than luminous .

		You recognize the acute and practised debater in his replies to some modern critics of
Butler	PERSON	.

		Yet he interests rather than satisfies us .

		His discussions of
Butler	PERSON	's method , and of his mental qualities , are perhaps the best parts of what must be pronounced a rather dull volume .

		Some readers may care to know that the author somewhat leans toward the doctrine of con - ditional immortality .

		A pleasant picture of
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	's '' Pope
Leo XIII	PERSON	. ''

		strikes us as easily the best volume , thus far , in the useful '' Pub - lic Men of To-Day '' series -LRB-
F. Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	is in full sympathy with his theme , and he treats it lucidly and temperately , and with com - mendable breadth and balance of judgment where the papal attitude toward vexed social and political questions , past and current , is discussed .

		It will be well worth while for those who wish to inform them - selves briefly and pleasantly as to the main features of
Leo	PERSON	's career and personality , and his share in and views on public events , to turn to Mr.
McCar	PERSON	- thy 's little book .

		Especially good are the chapters on the German Kultur-Kampf , and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's relations with organized labor .

		There is an attrac - tive frontispiece portrait of the Pope , showing a strong , calm , benevolent face truly '' a face like a benediction . ''

		Bigotry itself might melt before the tale of
Leo	PERSON	's genuine goodness and high humani - tarian intent ; and Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	tells it well , and with a sober enthusiasm that is more effective than the strained panegyric of mere hero-worship or saint-worship .

		Some literary Mr -
Laurence Button	PERSON	's `` Literary landmarks of Landmarks of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is
Venice	LOCATION	.

		a verv acceptable addition to his pretty series of volumes on the '' Literary Land - marks '' of
London	LOCATION	, of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		The text is based on the author 's article on
Venice	LOCATION	in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' for
July , 1896	DATE	; and is the result , he tells us , of weeks of patient study of the Queen of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	herself .

		The usual Venetian guide-book is mostly a bald affair , and aggravat - ingly devoid of the class of facts sought by the book - man .

		It tells us , of course , where
Faliero	PERSON	plotted and
Foscari	ORGANIZATION	fell , where Desdemona wept and Shy - lock drew his bond ; but it gives no hint as to where 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Scott	PERSON	lodged or
Rogers	PERSON	breakfasted of the doings and habitations , in short , of the many English and American men of letters who have visited or lived at
Venice	LOCATION	.

		This lack it is Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's chief aim to supply ; and his book should find a place in the satchel of every American tourist to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		There is much pleasant chat as to
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	, the Brownings , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	,
Eugene Schuyler	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, and other literary lights the great Italians who have lived at
Venice	LOCATION	not , of course , being neglected .

		There are a number of illustrations . ''

		The Spirit in Litf.rature and Life . ''

		In all the various attempts which men are making to re-state their old - time faith in the light of modern needs and discoveries , few have been attended with more success than '' The Spirit in Literature and Life '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , the little posthumous work of Dr.
Coyle	PERSON	.

		Starting with the conception of spirit , some - thing in the sense of the word Zeitgeist , as a pure phenomenon and by no means an abstraction , the author traces the development of the Hebrew spirit up through the history of the kings and prophets and priests to the time of Jesus , in whose work he sees the fruition of the long course of development .

		His spirit is seen carrying the social instincts of men into the various relationships of life .

		Every - thing that makes toward the union of man with man and of man with God is normal .

		On this basis the author works out , somewhat briefly , a new concep - tion of the old theological dogmas .

		He does not , it is true , arrive at conclusions which would please the most ultra-conservative , but at the same time his own spirit is so liberal and earnest as to disarm criticism .

		The book is marked by a wide reading , and a mastery of many things sufficient to enable the author to know what not to say .

		It is most cer - tainly a book for readers of the present day .

		A good book Certainly the best book ever written on the myths of by its author is '' The Myths of the the New world .

		New World , ' ' by Dr.
Daniel G. Brin	PERSON	- ton .

		For nearly thirty years it has profoundly influenced ethnological thought , and has done much to kindle interest in the psychology , mythology , and religion of the native Americans .

		The earlier edi - tions have for some time been difficult to secure .

		The third edition , just from the press of Mr.
David McKay	PERSON	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, is fairly revised , and contains some fifty pages of new matter .

		The general treat - ment and style of the first edition have for the most part been retained .

		Nowhere have development and progress been more rapid than in ethnologic science ; many views which , when first advanced by our author , were bold and novel , are to-day almost commonplaces .

		It is unnecessary to here review the book in detail , but a hint of its contents may not be without value to the reader who has not seen the older editions .

		Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	discusses such topics as the Idea of God ,
Sacred Numbers	ORGANIZATION	, Bird and Serpent Symbols , Myths regarding the World Elements , Supreme Gods of the Red Race ,
Cosmogonies	ORGANIZATION	, The Origin of Man , the Conception of the Soul .

		To study the religious thought of a rude and barbarous folk is suggestive and stimulating to every thought - ful reader .

		LiITERARY NOTES .

		The
Joseph Knight Company	ORGANIZATION	announce a new edition , in fourteen volumes , of Lady
Jackson	PERSON	's popular books on French history and society . ''

		An Arctic Boat Journey in the
Autumn of 1854	DATE	, '' by Dr.
Isaac I. Hayes	PERSON	, has just been put into a new edition by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was first published in
1860	DATE	.

		Ill the notice of
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's Reminiscences , in the last issue of THE DIAL -LRB- p. 157 -RRB- , the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	PERSON	, and not the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, should have been named as the American publishers of the book .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition of '' The Life of
Richard Cobden	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	.

		There are two volumes as before , unchanged as far as we have observed , and the price is three dollars .

		Messrs.
Sheehan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, announce a series of reprints illustrative of English history , to be edited by Mr.
W. Dawson Johnston	PERSON	.

		They will consist of documentary matter , and will cost

		Songs and Other Verses , '' '' Second Book of Tales , '' and `` The Holy Cross and Other Tales , `` three volumes by the late
Eugene Field	PERSON	, which have already been dis - cussed in our review of the complete edition of
Field	ORGANIZATION	's writings , are now published in a less expensive form -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and are obtainable separately .

		Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	, writing to the American press , says that '' it has become an open secret that Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	is practically under an injunction to preserve silence . ''

		If the effect of an appointment as
Laureate	ORGANIZATION	is hereafter to be that of muzzling the poet thus dis - tinguished , we could wish to see the office multiplied .

		Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	's new translation of Tourgue ' - nieff 's '' Virgin Soil , '' in two volumes , and a translation of
Herr Bjb	PERSON	` rnson 's '' The
Fisher Lass	PERSON	, '' are among the latest publications of
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the same source we have received '' The Exodus , '' in '' The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' and two new volumes of the '' Temple '' Shakespeare , '' Pericles , '' and '' Cymbeline . '' ''

		Bimetallism in History '' is the subject of the issue of `` Sound Currency '' for
August 15	DATE	.

		Mr.
Henry Loomis Nelson	PERSON	, the editor of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' is the author of this pamphlet , which marshalls the arguments for the gold standard in a highly effective way .

		Spe - cial attention should also be called to Professor Sum - ner 's uncompromisingly logical treatment of this subject in the
October	DATE	'' Chautauquan . ''

		Three booklets upon subjects of timely interest have just been published by Mr.
Henry Altemus	PERSON	, of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		They are '' The Higher Education as a Train - ing for Business , '' by Professor
Harry Pratt Judson	PERSON	; '' The Origin , Meaning , and Application of the Monroe

		THE DIAL 199 Doctrine , '' by Professor
John Bach McMaster	PERSON	; and '' Why Americans Dislike England , '' by Professor
George Burton Adams	PERSON	.

		All three are neatly bound in white boards .

		Readers of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' in its recent issues have been conscious of a subtle transformation in the spirit and purpose of the magazine .

		The change may perhaps be defined as an attempt to give to the contents a greater degree of actuality and a wider scope than they have had hitherto , without sacrificing the lit - erary quality which has made the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' preemi - nent among its contemporaries .

		A new department , called '' Men and Letters , '' appears in the
October	DATE	num - ber , and includes short signed articles similar to those of the '' Contributor 's Club . ''

		It is a pleasant addition to the magazine , and is very happily begun by Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	.

		The
Princeton Sesquicentennial	ORGANIZATION	, to occur this month , will be celebrated for three days beginning with Octo - ber 22 .

		There will be a distinguished gathering of European and American scholars to do honor to the ven - erable institution of learning , and the occasion will be in many ways memorable .

		A feature of much general interest is provided by the public lecture courses of which announcement has just been made .

		These lec - tures will run from the 12th to the 19th of the month -LRB- thus preceding the formal celebration -RRB- , and the lectur - ers include Professors
Edward Dowden	PERSON	,
Karl Brugmann	PERSON	,
Felix Klein	PERSON	, and
Andrew Seth	PERSON	.

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's lec - tures will be six in number , having for their general theme `` The French Revolution and English Litera - ture . ''

		TO
SWINBURNE	LOCATION	.

		By the light and the love of the lilies ; By the hue of the hyaline stones ; By the whinny of whimpering fillies To the meek mother-mare , as she moans ; By the gleam and the growl of the dog-star , That howls on his hubs , as they turn ; By the murk and the mist of the fog-bar , We adjure thee ,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, Tell us ,
Bard	LOCATION	, in a rondel or sapphic ,
Virelai	LOCATION	, villanelle , or ballade , In language for once somewhat graphic , What thy message is , ere we go mad !

		Feeble mouths faintly falter thy music , Word-witchcraft betrays thy behest ; Of rime-revels , indeed , not a few sick Cry : '' Give us a rest ! ''

		If , like Eve , thou forbidden fruit feed me , My old Adam adumbrates desire , Poet sad , mad , and bad , as I read thee , The apple to pick from the mire .

		But I swoon , for thy word-swirls oppress me ; Walking water , I falter and fall ; I am crazy to ken , Heaven bless me , What thou means ' t by it all !

		The crest and the crown of the laurel , Worn by bards who would broach '' nothing base , '' Burns a brand on the brow of the lorel To whom the distinction 's disgrace .

		But profounder disgrace , O enigma Of poets and prophets , is thine , For stamping with stain and with stigma Thy genius divine !

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, The '' BOOKMAN '' of
New York	LOCATION	says OF NEPHELE A NOVEL BY
FRANCIS WILLIAM BOURDILLON	PERSON	12mO -RRB- artistically bound price , One Dollar `` We urge so rare a treat as its pages impart on the attention of our readers . ''

		From THE
LONDON	LOCATION	SPECTATOR -LRB- page review -RRB- .

		Mr.
Bourdillon	PERSON	knows how to make a meeting in the spirit read as real and impressive as a meeting in the flesh , and how to elaborate his conception so as to make it seem a true deed of destiny , and of that kind of destiny to which the Greeks gave the name a result of imperious necessity , breaking ruthlessly through all the more natural and humble attractions of human life , and impressing the high , and we may almost say bleak , rapture of tragedy on lives that might have seemed carefully prepared for sweet and innocent delight .

		Mr.
Bourdillon	PERSON	must have felt to the very bottom of his heart what Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	, while he was still an Anglican , said of the mar - vellous mystery of music , and we almost wonder that he did not take it for the motto of his little poetical romance . ''

		To many men , '' said Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, '' the very names which the science -LSB- of music -RSB- employs , are utterly incom - prehensible .

		To speak of an idea or subject seems to be fanciful or trifling , to speak of the views which it opens upon us , to be childish extravagance ; yet is it possible that the inexhaustible evolution and disposition of notes , so rich yet so simple , so intricate yet so regulated , so various yet so majestic , should be a mere sound which is gone and perishes !

		Can it be that those mysterious stirrings of heart , and keen emotions , and strange yearnings after we know not what , and awful impressions from we know not whence , should be wrought in us by what is unsub - stantial , and comes and goes , and begins and ends in itself !

		It is not so ; it can not be .

		No , they have escaped from some higher sphere ; they are the outpourings of eternal harmony in the medium of created sound ; they are echoes from our Home ; they are the voice of Angels or the Magnificat of Saints , or the living laws of Divine Government or the Divine attributes ; something are they besides themselves which we can not compass , which we can not utter though mortal man , and he perhaps not otherwise distinguished above his fellows , has the gift of eliciting them . ''

		That is the conception of music on which this poetical romance is founded ; and very finely it is constructed .

		From THE
LONDON	LOCATION	ATHEN/EUM .

		The central idea of two persons bound together by an intense musical sympathy capable of acting '' telepath - ically '' trenches closely on the domain of the fairy tale ; but Mr.
Bourdillon	PERSON	manages to pitch his narrative in the right key for producing an effect of quasi - reality ; while the little touches of school and university life do not , on the other hand , jar by over-realism .

WILLIAM MORRIS	PERSON	.

		Of the six great poets whose names stand preeminent in the later Victorian era , five have gone to their rest , and the solitary figure of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	alone remains to bear aloft the torch of the singer .

		Rossetti died in
1882	DATE	, Arnold in
1888	DATE	,
Browning	PERSON	in
1889	DATE	,
Tennyson	PERSON	in
1892	DATE	; and now '' the idle singer of an empty day , '' as
William Morris	PERSON	styled himself with modesty no less excessive than that which prompted
Keats	PERSON	in the suggestion of his own epitaph , has ceased from life , and entered into the inheritance of fame that he shares with
Chaucer	PERSON	and
Boccacio	PERSON	, with the creators of
Norse	ORGANIZATION	saga and mediaeval French romance .

		The death of these five men one after another , with - out the appearance of any new poet comparable with the least of them , has practically estab - lished the contention made many years ago by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, that a well - marked period in English poetry was drawing to its close with the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The affinities of
Morris	PERSON	are with
Rossetti	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, rather than with
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, or
Tennyson	LOCATION	; and the public early learned to associate the three poets first-named , not only with one another , but also with the movement in English painting of which Ros - setti was one of the chief glories .

		These men , painters and poets alike , have been variously described as Pre-Raphaelites , members of the stained-glass school , apostles of medievalism and of Renaissance art .

		No one of the epithets is exact or comprehensive , but all are at least suggestive of the aims and methods of the ex - traordinary group of men of genius to whom they are applied .

		And of the three poets con - cerned it is to be noted that
Morris	PERSON	was the first to make himself heard . ''

		The Defence of Guenevere '' was published in
1858	DATE	; three years later came
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Early Italian Poets , '' and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Rosamond '' and kt The Queen Mother . ''

		It was not until
1870	DATE	that
Rossetti	PERSON	's first collection of original poems was exhumed from the grave of his wife and given to the world .

		When we examine the total poetical product of the three men , we find a wide differentiation of achievement , although a common impulse and common sympathies 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, may be detected at their starting-points .

		The dramatic genius , the political and ethical pas - sion , displayed by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in his ma - turer work , are without a parallel in the work of
Morris	PERSON	; nor did the latter long remain tram - melled by the mysticism and the spiritual sub - tlety that were characteristic of
Rossetti	PERSON	's poetry to the last .

		As for comparison with
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	, it is clean out of the question .

		These men felt the whole burden of the modern world , were oppressed by its enig - mas , and looked toward the future rather than the past .

		Morris , on the other hand , found all his inspiration in the past , and the golden age of which he sang was envisaged as a rever - sion rather than as a progressive evolution .

		`` Dreamer of dreams , born out of my due time , '' he called himself ; and , man of affairs that he became and remained to outward seeming , his inner life was always attuned to the simpler harmonies of the naive older world .

		The plan and craftsmanship of '' The Earthly Paradise , '' the work by which
Morris	PERSON	is best known , are such as to make inevitable some comparison with '' The Canterbury Tales , '' and the author has frequently been described as a modern Chaucer .

		The ascription of this title has a certain rough external value , but little more .

		Certainly we may say that '' The Earthly Paradise '' is the only work in all English lit - erature to challenge comparison with `` The Canterbury Tales . ''

		Nearly five hundred years had to elapse after the death of Chaucer before
England	LOCATION	could produce his peer as a story-teller by right divine .

		But the similarity does not extend far beyond this fact .

		Chaucer 's tales were in their essence prophetic rather than retrospective ; they heralded the coming glories of English literature , they were in a sense the precursors of the Elizabethan drama and the modern novel .

		The tales told by
Morris	PERSON	have in common with them little except the qualities of easy rhythm and noble diction that belong to all great poetry , and the fact that they are tales and not subjective outpourings .

		Of the wit , the shrewdness , the practical good sense , the dramatic faculty , and the insight into the recesses of individual character displayed by
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, there is very little to be found in
Morris	LOCATION	; but we find instead the conception of men as types rather than individuals , the fresh and simple outlook upon nature , the very breath and finer spirit of all romance .

		We find , too , a curious blend of Hellenism with medieval - ism , or rather an amalgam of the elements of pure beauty common to both styles , the objec - tivity , the simplicity , and the grace of an art hardly tinged with self-consciousness and inno - cent of any concealed ulterior motive .

		Pure beauty may indeed be taken as the note of all the poetry that
William Morris	PERSON	has left for the enrichment of our literature .

		`` Full of soft music and familiar olden charm , '' to use Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's felicitous phrase , it has the power to lull the senses into forgetfulness of this modern workaday world , to restore the soul with draughts from the wellsprings of life , to bring back the wonder of childhood , the glory and the dream that we may perhaps have thought to be vanished beyond recall .

		It is poetry to read in the long
summer	DATE	days when we seek rest from strenuous endeavor ; it is poetry for the beguilement of all weariness , and for the refreshment of our faith in the simple virtues and the unsophisticated life ; it is poe - try that brings a wholesome and healing min - istry akin to that of Nature herself ; it is poetry that leaves the recollection unsullied by any suggestion of impurity and unhaunted by any spectre of doubt .

		Like
Lethe	LOCATION	, it has the gift of oblivion for those who seek the embrace of its waters ; but , unlike the dark-flowing stream of the underworld , its surface is rippled by the breezes of earth , its banks are overarched by living foliage , and its waves mirror the glad sunlight .

		This rich treasure of song includes the tentative first volume of miscellaneous poems , the great epic of '' The Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	, '' the twenty-four tales of the wan - derers who sought , but did not find , '' The Earthly Paradise , '' the `` morality '' of `` Love is Enough , '' the story of ''
Sigurd the Volsung	PERSON	, '' and the volume of '' Poems by the Way . ''

		To this list we should also add the versions of the '' Odyssey '' and the '' ^ JEneid , '' which are great English poems , whatever may be said of them as translations .

		We have thus far made no mention of the group of works in which the genius of the poet found a new medium of expression during the last few years of his life .

		There is nothing in English literature sufficiently like them to be put in the same class with the series of five books that began with '' The House of the Wolfings '' and ended , shortly before the au - thor 's death , with '' The Well at the World 's End . ''

		These romances mingle formal poetry with a sort of poetic prose that has all the qual - ities of poetry save metre , and that does not err this is a very important point by any approach to rhythmical regularity .

		Mr.
Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	says the final word upon the subject :
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 '' While the poet 's object is to arouse in the listener an expectancy of csesuric effects , the great goal before the writer of poetic prose is in the very opposite direc - tion ; it is to make use of the concrete figures and impas - sioned diction that are the poet 's vehicle , but at the same time to avoid the expectancy of metrical bars .

		The mo - ment that the regular bars assert themselves and lead the reader 's ear to expect other bars of the like kind , sincerity ends . ''

		Of poetic prose in the true sense are these romances chiefly made , and their beauty is as absolute , in its own way , as the beauty of the avowed poems .

		We may speak of these books as a class by repeating what we said some years ago in a review of one of them '' The Story of the Glittering Plain . ''

		`` The reader of Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's first volume of poems might have dis - cerned therein glimpses of the author 's affinities for an art even less sophisticated than the Chaucerian , and of the ideals of a still more primitive age .

		The subsequent development of the author 's genius has made this clear enough , and the types of thought and speech which he has delighted to embody have grown more and more archaic and remote .

		He has found the true springtime of the world , not even in the poems of Homer , but in the sagas of
Iceland	LOCATION	, in the conditions of Teutonic life of which
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	affords us a glimpse , and in the still more primeval regions which myth and folk-lore enable us to penetrate .

		And he has developed a style in keeping with the life which he depicts , a style which has permitted him to translate the saga literature as it was never translated before , a style of severe and noble simplicity from which the Latin element of the language is all but wholly banished . ''

		In the foregoing characterization of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, he has been considered simply as an English man of letters , with no reference to the many activities that he associated with the pursuit of literature .

		In a strict sense , of course , poetry was his avocation , just as it was with
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	; but the world will remember the poet in both cases long after it has forgot - ten the professor of medicine and the master of decorative design .

		Yet if
Morris	PERSON	had writ - ten no books he would have been one of the most noteworthy men of his time , and his labors in the field of the practical arts would have earned for him the warmest gratitude of all who are struggling to make the world better worth living in .

		In the department of house - hold decoration he has exerted a wide influence for good ; by means of the famous
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	, he has done much to develope the pub - lic taste for books that are mechanically works of art ; as the advocate of what are probably impossible ideals of social organization , he has done much to stimulate the moral sense of Englishmen , and persuade them that ours is by no means the best of all possible civiliza - tions .

		He has lived a great and a good life , in the best sense a life of service to mankind , and his death is a loss which it would be diffi - cult to exaggerate .

		212 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, GEORGE DUMAURIER .

		The author of '' Trilby '' died in
London	LOCATION	on the eighth of this month , at the age of sixty-two .

		Had his death occurred five years ago , the news would have made some stir in artistic circles , hut a literary journal would hardly have been called upon to so much as mention it .

		To-day , his death means the loss of a widely-read novelist , and is a cause of gen - uine grief to many thousands who had never heard of him until he was nearly sixty years old .

		His con - tribution to literature consisted , as everybody knows , of ``
Peter Ibbetson	PERSON	, '' `` Trilby , '' and `` The Mar - tian , '' the latter of these three novels being now in course of serial publication in '' Harper 's Magazine . ''

		The astonishing popularity of '' Trilby '' in this coun - try -LRB- for the book had no such vogue anywhere else -RRB- was the result of a '' craze '' rather than of a genu - ine recognition of the meritorious qualities of that novel .

		What it was that caught the American fancy whether the hypnotism of Svengali , or the bare feet of the heroine , or the eccentricities of her three champions is not easy to determine , but it is quite certain that the success of the book was not won upon rational grounds .

		To a judge of literature , indeed , '' Trilby '' had admirable qualities , but the things that attracted popular attention were the accidental features of the work , and even the blots upon its execution .

		Its unconventional and ama - teurish qualities were condoned by the critic for the sake of the rich and genial nature that found ex - pression in its pages .

		One could not help feeling that here was a talent akin to that of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and there was no lack of charitable allowance for the fact that the author was a beginner in literature . ''


Peter Ibbetson	PERSON	, '' which came before '' Trilby , '' is thought by some to be the better novel of the two , but in this j udgment we can not concur .

		As for '' The Martian , '' comparison is as yet out of the question .

		Du Maurier appears to have been a singularly lov - able man , and his readers felt that they were brought into unusually intimate relations with his personal - ity .

		For this reason particularly his death brings with it a sense of loss quite out of proportion to the importance of his literary achievements .

		ORIGINALITY IN LITERA TURE .

		On the appearance of a new force in literature , the critics constitute the conservative element in appraising the work and giving it its place ; the public , poor giddy-headed thing , not seldom jumps at what is to its taste , swallowing it whole in a gusto of unthinking dietetic delectation .

		But they whose sacred function it is to be at once Radamanthus and Mercury , stern judge and messenger of good to men , are not so easily caught , and at once begin to apply tests and standards .

		These are likely to be tradi - tional and well-defined : the canons of an estab - lished literary development , the criteria not of yes -
terday	DATE	but of generations and centuries .

		The new aspirants who win critical favor , moreover , are gen - erally bound to do good work within these recognized and well-defined limits .

		This is natural , and of easy solution : it is always a plainer task to judge a given thing by some standard of common agree - ment , while it is folly to deny that a residuum of truth is here ; familiar accents are those best loved by even the critical ear .

		When the pioneers of lit - erary expression or of form appear , they it is who , as a rule , fare hardest at the hands of the critical class , even if the broad republic of readers be not deaf to the message .

		Temporary fluctuations there are , to be sure , when it becomes a fad to hail the bizarre novelty , the fresh voice ; and our own time is an illustration of this .

		When a
Francis Thomp	PERSON	- son emerges from the purlieu of obscurity , with the welcome drapery of a mysterious and romantic career about him , bringing the world -LRB- in his initial volume -RRB- the raw material of poetry rather than poetry itself , the furore he creates is of so exag - gerated a type , both among cultured readers and critics themselves , as to suggest the theory of the new for the new 's sake pushed ad absurdum .

		But even to-day , a
Francis Thompson	PERSON	could not win the consensus of critical opinion as to take another modern and strictly contemporaneous instance could a
William Watson	PERSON	.

		In the latter 's verse is to be seen the culture of the schools , the methods of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, the sobriety and bal - ance of a great and accredited tradition in English poetry .

		Hence , while he is written down as '' lit - erary , '' his place is secured quicker and more surely than that of a bard whose manner is more violently individual and whose literary lineage is less plainly to be traced .

		On the one hand , then , tradition is always at work , and -LRB- for a season at least -RRB- the work is most likely to win plaudits whose way is in ac - cordance with its tenets ; on the other hand , the rebellious , the daring and progressive , the icono - clastic maker of literature , blazing new paths and moving forward with an unwonted and uncouth gait , will in the nature of things have an unsmooth time and make slower progress .

		No objection to this class of innovations is more often brought to bear than that of affectation : it is a stumbling block for every new writer whose man - ner is markedly aside from the beaten way ; it is dinned into his ears , mayhap , until he become self - conscious , dropping what was a natural and legiti - mate mode of expression for that which , while more conventional , is for that very reason , for him , imi - tative and unnatural .

		If it happened that the new hand be resolute and independent enough to push on in indifference to these criticisms , in time its '' affectation '' will more likely than not be dubbed '' originality , '' and the struggle be over .

		Blunt - schli 's phrase , '' Politics is present history and his - tory past politics , '' suggests the literary parallel : affectation is present originality , originality past affectation .

		Very often this apothegm is vindicated .

		Familiar examples in our day are afforded by poets
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 213 like
Browning	PERSON	and Whitman .

		The English mas - ter 's early and tentative efforts and his idiosyn - crasies were marked in such a cryptic work as '' Sordello '' found no audience , and he had to win his way slowly , not coming to conceded and wide recognition until middle-age had come , and the ap - proval he most cared for that of his wife was impossible , since she had passed '' to where beyond these voices there is peace . ''

		But
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing held stoutly to his individuality cacophoneity , psychologic stress , obscurity , and all ; never abating jot or tittle of his faith or method , and leaving to the society formed to expound his verse the parlous task of explaining his meaning , when it lay beyond ordinary comprehension .

		Even long after he was ranked with
Tennyson	PERSON	as chief singer of the
Vic	PERSON	- torian era , yea , now when he is dead and his poetry is subject to the decree of Time , there be those who believe that his peculiarities were self-consciously wilful , that he was , in short , '' affected . ''

		But the bulk of the best opinion will join the dictum of his idolators of the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	in the decision that his manner was natural , his very own in an inti - mate'and organic sense ; that
Browning	PERSON	is a stalwart specimen of the species Original .

		The case is some - what different with
Whitman	PERSON	.


Browning	PERSON	, with all his artistic blemishes , was , broadly viewed , a great artist : the Camden Seer for a long life-time deliberately refused to do his work after the prescribed rules of verse , eschewing rhyme , definite rhythm , the dic - tion and form of poetry , and the principle of artistic selection .

		He conquered , so far as he did conquer , by the natural music in him sounding forth in his irregularly rhythmic , half-prosaic dithyrambs , and by the picturesque virility and the large sweep of his thought and expression .

		But the point at issue is , What of the validity of this phenomenon ?

		Affecta - tion and originality are in turn attributed to him , according as the critic regards his mannerisms and extravagances as an integral and honest part of him , or as intentionally assumed , an art-pose for the sake of blague - Good men have taken either side : Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	the affirmative , Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	the negative .

		And much confusion there is at present concerning this formid - able individuality , who insistently demands some classification , yet on whom few are agreed .

		An inter - national society for the reverent study of his life and work is already founded , yet it is safe to say that it will be some years hence before his biography is included in our regular Men of Letters series .

		The whole question of affectation versus origi - nality , then , comes to this : Is a man 's manner , his method of expression , natural and honest ?

		If so , however contrary to the accepted theory , however shocking to experience and taste , he is to be studied on this major premise , and not to be refused a hear - ing .

		He is , to be sure , open to jealous and judicial judgment at the bar of Art , and indicted if found guilty .

		Whitman , in our opinion , must plead guilty to this indictment .

		But he can not be refused a trial on the ground that he is & poseur .

		Past literary rec - ord declares that history will show this to be unfair and frequently wrong in the sequel ; moreover , it is evident that if traditional criticism be allowed to settle each new claimant 's case , there can be no uni - form standard , for the very good reason that tradi - tions vary with the years and the current schools .

		Yesterday , classicism perhaps had sole sway ; to - day , romanticism has ; to-morrow , realism may have ; the day after to-morrow , neo-romanticism ; none of them is all-perfect , all of them contain the millet seed of truth .

		And so the novitiate is the buffet of temporal canons .

		When the English poet - critic , Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, was lecturing in
Balti	LOCATION	- more , he took occasion to refer to the Southern poet ,
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, whose connection with
Johns Hop	PERSON	- kins University he knew , and whose medallion indeed looked at him from the wall as he spoke in terms of kindly but frank disapproval .

		He depre - cated what he called
Lanier	PERSON	's '' strained attempt to be original . ''

		The scene well furnishes a text for our sermon : the British critic , with his leaning to tradition and classicality in English poetry , utterly failed to grasp the seriousness , the spontaneity and the deep spiritual honesty of the American singer as man and poet , qualities precluding the possibility of his straining for effect or striving toward a fan - tastic originality .

		The literary bias of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, and his unfamiliarity with
Lanier	PERSON	as a man , disqual - ified his judgment , which already , ten years having elapsed , is being reversed by the best critical opin - ion , which awards the Georgian , half-accomplished and tentative as his work was , his place among the few masters of American song .

		But granting that this esoteric test of honesty be the safer one , how may we apply it ?

		The objector might , not unnaturally , claim that the difficulty of judging a man 's character in his work was quite as much open to the chance of error as are the fluctu - ating tests of more objective and conventional liter - ary criticism .

		But a little reflection will , we fancy , prove this to be otherwise .

		It is a pretty safe gen - eral proposition that a man 's essential character can be gathered from his work ; the '' real John '' speaks there if anywhere .

		True , often the life is sadly in dissonance with the written profession or implica - tion : one thinks of
Rousseau	PERSON	with his ''
Emile	PERSON	, '' let - ting his own illegitimate children die in the found - ling 's hospital ; of
Byron	LOCATION	, frankly a roue and sensualist ; and of
Bacon	LOCATION	, wisest , meanest of man - kind .

		But we maintain that a good book -LRB- in the ethic sense -RRB- means a good man either in positive or potential .

		In the cases of those who blot their fair fame on the personal side with sins and shortcom - ings , we see men who were made for higher things , however out of tune and harsh under the fierce as - saults of the flesh or the lure of worldliness .

		As no - where else , such are sincere in their books .

		And when , in addition to the subtle testimony of the printed page that permanent registration of the inner spirit , the life of the writer , studied and analyzed in all its light and shade , its confusing minutiae and the significance of its rounded whole , is seen to be 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, beautiful and for the nonce blameless , there is set up a dual and cumulative surety that here is no pos - ing trickster , but a genuine and straightforward hu - man brother , with failings beyond doubt , but one lovable and trustworthy .

		And our great literary personalities can be thus studied , and should be , in order to reach any conclusion upon this vexed ques - tion of their affectation .

		The method of proof is thus that of literary crit - icism corrected by the study of personal character .

		Such a matter as the honesty or dishonesty of man - nerisms can only be settled in this way .

		Apply the test of life to the literature of a
Browning	PERSON	, a Whit - man , or a Meredith , and much of the criticism which , reversing the habit of the court , assumes the pris - oner guilty until he proves his innocence , will be exposed in all its nugatory superficiality .

		COMMUNIGA TIONS .

		A WORLD-ANTHOLOGY OF LYRIC POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The earnest lover of poetry , in his desire to become intimately acquainted with '' that great Poem which all poets , like the cooperating thoughts of one great mind , have built up since the beginning of the world '' -LRB-
Shel	PERSON	- ley , quoted by Palgrave -RRB- , finds , firstly , that much of it is inaccessibly locked up in foreign literatures ; secondly , that contemporary additions of value , though more ac - cessible , must frequently wait years before being brought to his notice by the collectors of anthologies , who , besides , necessarily omit much that is good .

		He may approxi - mately keep pace with the additions in his own language , though his enjoyment will be marred by the necessity for reference work ; but he can make no pretence , beyond a very limited one , of overcoming the first obstacle .

		In the latter respect , the art of poetry is exceptional in the hindrances to its progress .

		Music , sculpture , painting , and inventions have no limitations of language , but at once become common property so far as their benefits are concerned .

		The obstacle of inaccessibility is , indeed , insurmountable by the general public .

		But when we consider the relative importance , for the devel - opment of literature , of that class of readers whose members , though few , may become leaders of taste and culture , and that , if each foreign language possessed a collection of but half the value which Palgrave 's '' Golden Treasury '' might have by being brought down to the present year , the probability that the thin veil of Teu - tonic and Romance languages would deter few of our leaders from assimilating those collections , and thus other languages represented would find more readers than at present , when we consider these propositions , the thoughts arise that a World-Anthology of Lyric Poetry , even in a pot-pourri of the original languages , would fill a want ; and if the scheme of the collection were such as to admit of organic increase from year to year , we could then say that our literary culture was not behind our science in its mechanical helps .

		The culti - vated of all nations would be drawn together by observ - ing their own place and that of their neighbors in the most sacred activity of the mind .

		Whatever shape may be taken by the re-flowering of poetry prophesied by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, it will be powerfully influenced by the standard of excellence previously adopted .

		Such a standard can not but be raised by a more faithful absorp - tion of the best the world has to give .

		The project thus suggested is doubtless too formid - able to be in its perfection other than an ideal in our time .

		But by judicious limitations we may bring the essential features within range of our immediate powers .

		I have in my mind 's eye a volume , or rather volumes , consisting of a text and a bulky appendix .

		The text consists of lyric selections of all periods in the most important literary languages , dead as well as living .

		The term '' lyric '' here applies to the spirit , not the form ; for the selections , besides complete poems , include many passages from longer poems of all kinds , not ex - cluding blank verse .

		All are characterized by unob - trusiveness of art , inevitableness , and absolute sincerity ; and by a degree of simplicity , intensity of feeling , ex - cellence of expression , and concentration .

		They are largely of that kind of poetry which appeals to the heart directly , rather than to the heart through the intellect , according to the pithy distinction made by a reviewer in THE DIAL .

		The appendix includes all of the poems -LRB- when short , and good enough -RRB- from which passages were quoted in the text ; other poems that have excel - lence but are shut out of the text by the severe stand - ard adopted ; and necessary annotations , including prose translations when deemed advisable .

		The characteristic of the text is poetic intensity ; that of the appendix , an attempt at scholarly completeness .

		Most of the labor of preparing the appendix may be relegated to future years , or the next generation .

		The selections in the text , in this imagined volume , are not arranged according to periods , it is assumed that ultimately the poems themselves are more precious than their minor traits ; that the readers of such a work already possess the requisite historical knowledge .

		Log - ical and artistic arrangement throughout is regarded as an essential feature of the presentation of that Poem of the World referred to by
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Nevertheless , poems of different periods are not indiscriminately mixed .

		Much of the work is naturally composed of sub-groups , each containing poems of a separate period .

		An exam - ple -LRB- necessarily very imperfect , for the work does not ex - ist -RRB- may best illustrate : A few of a certain class of love - poems would probably be arranged as in the following list of first lines , in which the affinities of the

		PROOF IN LITERARY USAGE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The correspondent who discussed the subject of proof in literary ` usage in your last issue seems unaware that , while asking what constitutes proof , he is in effect pre - cluding proof .

		When we say that a given usage is his - torical , he replies that history is irrelevant - when we ex - hibit the evidence that it is present , he maintains that our evidence is occasional .

		Without going into the com - plete theory of proof , there is no doubt that argument must be addressed to the issue as made ; and I may be pardoned for recalling that this is just what I endeav - ored to urge and to illustrate in my brief letter in THE DIAL of
July 16	DATE	, entitled '' Journalistic Retribution . ''

		The mere dogmatist may with simple denial be dis - missed to his prejudices and predilections : to the claim - ant that reason or analogy forbids this or that combina - tion , it is enough to show that this or that combination is or has at some time been reasonable in some tongues and has its recognized parallels in our own ; to him who maintains that illustrations of a given locution cited from representative authors are exceptional , the cita - tions may be multiplied , or a confident and competent observer is warranted in diverting the burden to the ob - jector : to him who arrays authorities , their admitted fallibility in other issues may be demonstrated , while other authorities may be pitted against his host , after an asserted and exemplified present , national , and reputable usage is discredited as exceptional .

		Of course , rhetoric changes ; and usage remains the only test of usage , without which authority is puerile and reason and analogy are inadequate , while dogma and prejudice are always insignificant .

		In view of a recognized and prevailing grammatical principle , an occasional violation is not usage , a regular or approxi - mately regular violation is usage ; hence
Hawthorne	PERSON	's whomsoever as subject is the former , while '' who did you see ? ''

		is the latter , in spite of any alleged authority , analogy , reason , or predilection .

		It is notable that ob - jectors , even while accepting the arbitrament of usage , insist on regarding as occasional illustrations they dis - like without the trouble of a fair count .

		It is in point to refer to the recent discussion of , '' Who was given a seat , '' which I believe I can illustrate overwhelmingly from any author in any form of literature valid for pres - ent usage , as well as from the irresponsible periodical publications .

		Indeed , the irony of fate '' pede Poena claudo '' has recently overtaken our friend '' The Book - man , '' who in his
September	DATE	issue -LRB- page 78 -RRB- writes `` We are accorded an insight . ''

		In the play of '' Caste , '' when the marchioness , whose universe is her visiting list , says , '' There are no such people as Eccles ! ''

		the aged bac - chanalian who owns that name rejoins , '' Well , marm , I takes the liberty of hexistin ' notwithstandin ' ! ''

		AN ILLOGICAL INFERENCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A correspondent in your issue of
October 1	DATE	has done me the honor of glancing over my excursus on '' Dog - matic Philology '' -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Sept. 1	DATE	, pp. 109-110 -RRB- , but his comments show that he could not have read it carefully , for there is nothing in my communication that can , by any logical inference , be brought into oppo - sition to the views which he , in common with every other sane man , holds .

		I agree with him entirely in the three main points he makes : -LRB- a -RRB- that the correct usage of a former period of the language , as in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Addison	PERSON	, is no proof of the correctness of pres - ent usage ; -LRB- b -RRB- that the use of an idiom in one language does not justify a similar use in another ; -LRB- c -RRB- that an array of blunders culled here and there from the works of reputable authors can not be used to establish proof of the correctness of these expressions .

		But I am at a loss to know what he found in my article that was at variance with these trite observations , or that would warrant an issue with me on these points .

		He asks , '' Does not the writer assume that rhetoric never changes ?

		Does he not accept an idiom in one language as evidence of acceptable usage in another tongue ?

		What pertinency is there otherwise to his quo - tations from Sophocles ,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	, or even from Spenser and Milton ? ''

		In the discussion of the phrase '' in our midst '' there was involved necessarily the use of the possessive adjec - tive in the objective sense ; and to show that this was not an isolated fact in English , I quoted , from
Latin	LOCATION	, Greek , French , and German classics , examples of similar usage .

		This , it was thought , would certainly not weaken the argument .

		When it came to treating the phrase under discussion as an English idiom , I went back to the Anglo-Saxon , following the historical method , and sup - porting the position by three quotations from
Schiller	PERSON	's classic German , the only other Teutonic tongue , I regret to say , that I am familiar enough with to quote .

		Since then , I have noticed that Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	-LRB- '' Mod - ern English , '' p. 49 -RRB- cites an example from Middle English , '' in her middis , that is to say , in their midst , '' in support of the genuineness of the idiom .

		I went a little farther back , to Old English ; that is all .

		And again , in combatting the statement of the rhet - orician that '' is gone '' is not idiomatic , I referred to Anglo-Saxon and German in vindication of its rights .

		In matters of English idiom one can not get away from one 's grandmother tongue , any more than in matters of heredity one can get away from one 's grandfather .

		It is rather late in the day , however , to have to reiterate , in self-defence , this evident truth .

		As to '' try and '' instead of '' try to , '' I did not '' cull here and there from books of accepted authors , '' but quoted four examples from a single essay of one of the most modern of modern men of letters .

Oct. 16	DATE	, A SURVIVING CONTEMPORARY OF LAMB , KEATS , AND SHELLEY .

		* From

		From cover to cover the little book spans a wide interval of years and manners .

		In her girlhood the writer was the pupil of

Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's earlier chapters may be conveyed by the following extract from the account of her wedding : '' I remember rather wondering at my own perfect calmness during the service , for I had determined not to follow
Charlotte Grandison	PERSON	's example of hesitation at saying the word obey , ' but to speak the love , honor , and obey ' with the full tone that should express the true wish of my heart to faithfully keep this vow .

		Well might I , with such a man as he was who had chosen me , and whom I had long known , esteemed , respected , ad - mired , and warmly loved . ''

		Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	was born at
London	LOCATION	on
June 22 , 1809	DATE	.

		Her father ,
Vincent Novello	PERSON	, the noted composer , was for twenty-six years organist at the
Portuguese Embassy	ORGANIZATION	's Chapel , whither his skill attracted a large and distin - guished concourse weekly .

		It used to be play - fully said of Mr.
Novello	PERSON	that his '' voluntaries , '' conventionally supposed to play the congrega - tion out , on the contrary kept them in , listen - ing till the very last note .

		ing , if slight , reminiscences .

		That she was a very `` proper '' little girl , of -LRB- as the times went -RRB- conscientious bringing - up , a little incident shows .

		She had been asked to a children 's party , where they were playing a round game of cards . ''

		When the nursery-maid came to fetch me home , the lady of the house offered me some silver , saying : Take this seven-and-sixpence , you have won it . '

		< I thought , ' I replied , ` that we were playing with counters ; I saw them on the table , ma'am .

		I did not know we were playing for money .

		I have none , and could not have paid if I had lost .

		Therefore I can ' t have won , and can ' t take that silver . '

		When I went home and told my mother what had happened , she said : ' You did well to refuse the money , and gave the right reason -LSB- the italics are ours -RSB- for doing so . ' ''

		The Novellos ' house in Oxford Street was naturally a resort of artists and literary people . ''

		Elia '' speaks passim of '' the little household , cake - producing , wine - bringing out , '' of the `` friendly supper - tray and draught of true Sutheran beer '' that succeeded to the feasts of music provided by the host .

		Besides the artists
Varley	ORGANIZATION	,
Copley	LOCATION	, Fielding , and others , Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	remembers having seen in the little drawing-room the Lambs ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	many distinguished guests , for whom her childish enthusiasm was curiously strong .

		Shelley she had a peep at over the par - lor window-blind , as he was leaving the house after a visit to her father ; of which incident she says : '' Well was I rewarded , for , as he passed before our house , he gave a glance up at it , and I beheld his seraph - like face , with its blue eyes , and aureoled by its golden hair . ''

		Keats she thus describes : '' I have even now a full recollection of the reverent look with which I regarded him , as he leaned against the side of the organ , listening with rapt attention to my father 's music .

		Keats 's favorite position one foot raised on his other knee still remains imprinted on my memory ; as also does the last time I saw him , half - reclining on some chairs that formed a couch for him when he was staying at
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's house , just before leaving
England	LOCATION	for
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		It was while the Novellos were living in Bed - ford Square that our author became a pupil of
Mary Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss Lamb had volunteered to give her little friend lessons in
Latin	LOCATION	; and the latter used , therefore , to trudge regularly at the appointed hour to
Great Russell Street	ORGANIZATION	, where the Lambs then lived .

		One morning , on entering the room , she found a guest sitting with Miss Lamb , whom she heard say , '' Oh , I am nothing now but a stocking-mending old woman . ''

		The speaker is thus described : '' This lady had straight , black brows , and looked still

		THE DIAL 217 young , I thought , and had a very intelligent , expressive countenance .

		When she went away ,
Miss Lamb	LOCATION	said , ' That is the excellent actress ,
Miss Kelly	PERSON	.

		Look at her well ,
Victoria	LOCATION	, for she is a woman to remember hay - ing seen .

		And , indeed , this was no other than the ad - mirable artiste to whom
Charles Lamb	PERSON	addressed his two sonnets ; the one beginning , ' You are not
Kelly	PERSON	of the common strain , ' and the other , on her performance of ' The Blind Boy , ' beginning , ' Rare artist , who with half thy tools or none Canst execute with ease thy curious art . ' ''

		From
Bedford Square the Novellos	ORGANIZATION	moved to
Shacklewell	LOCATION	; and it was at this period that Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	was sent to a school at
Boulogne	LOCATION	- sur-Mer , to acquire the French lan - guage .

		On returning from
Boulogne	LOCATION	, she be - came governess to the children of a Mr.
Pur	PERSON	- cell ; and in
1826	DATE	she was affianced to Mr.
Charles Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, whom she had long known .

		They were married in
1828	DATE	; and before settling down in
London	LOCATION	they spent a delightful Week with the Lambs at
Enfield	LOCATION	.


Charles Lamb	PERSON	, one can readily believe , was the '' cordialest of hosts , playful , genial , hospit - ably promotive of pleasurable things , walks , cheerful meals , and the very best of talk .

		Of his pranks there was no end ; and he really seems to have '' gone through life '' -LRB- as he said of his friend Rickman -RRB- '' laughing at solemn apes . '' ''

		His hospitality , while we were visiting him that memorable week , was characteristically manifested one day , in his own peculiarly whimsical way , by his starting up from dinner , hastening to the front garden gate , and opening it for a donkey that he saw standing there , and looking , as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	said , as if he wanted to come in and munch some of the grass growing so plentifully behind the railing . ''

		Another visit of signal interest was one paid by our author to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	-LRB- her '' first poet , '' and the object of her childish adoration -RRB- at
Highgate	LOCATION	.

		She says : '' I must have always had a touch of romance in my disposition , even as long back as when , quite a child , I had crept round the sofa to kiss his hand ... Thus to stay in the same house with him ; to be the companion of his walks about such charming environs ; to listen to his confidential talk after breakfast , in his flowered morning-gown , when he would discuss with me his then literary projects in a style which showed he felt he had near him one who could understand and appreciate his avowed views , all formed a bewitching combination that rendered this visit indeed a memorable one to me .

		He was then full of a project for writing a book to be called ' Fabulous Zoology , ' which was to treat of dragons , griffins , cockatrices , basilisks , etc. '' When the Cowden-Clarkes first settled in
London	LOCATION	,
Charles	PERSON	was writing for the news - papers , the `` Examiner '' among others , for which he wrote the theatrical notices .

		This engagement , says our author , '' afforded us most congenial entertainment for our evenings , since it took us perpetually to the different theatres . ''

		It was a day of great actors , and they saw the best of them ,
Edmund Kean	PERSON	, for instance .

		Of
Kean	PERSON	's famous '' Sir
Giles	PERSON	Overreach '' Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	remembers chiefly the death - scene . ''

		He lay prostrate near the footlights , his face and figure clearly visible to the audience , and fearfully true to the ebbing of life was the picture they presented .

		In ' Othello ' a striking point was the mode in which he clung to the side-scene when uttering the words , ' Not a jot , not a jot , ' in Act III. , scene 3 , as if trying to steady himself against the life-blow he was receiving .

		Towards the latter part of his career ,
Kean	PERSON	most frequently played ' Shylock , ' and grand was his playing throughout .

		But a superb piece of action and voice was his , as he delivered the speech , concluding with the words ' The villainy you teach me , I will execute ; and it shall go hard , but I will better the instruction . '

		He seemed positively to writhe from head to foot as he poured forth his anguished recapitulation of his own and his nation 's wrongs , and of his as deadly determination to have his revenge upon them . ''

		Of
Kean	PERSON	and Listen a humorous story is re - corded apropos of a wager laid by the latter that he could make
Kean	PERSON	laugh even on the stage , despite his boast that nothing could upset his gravity while there . ''

		Once , when
Kean	PERSON	was playing ' Holla , ' a procession of veiled Virgins of the Sun had to enter and pass be - fore him .

		The first virgin , as she passed , suddenly raised her veil , confronted
Kean	PERSON	with the irresistible visage of
Liston	PERSON	, and the wager was won , for
Kean	PERSON	went off into an uncontrollable fit of laughter . ''

		The evenings at the theatres brought the Cowden-Clarkes and
Hazlitt	PERSON	-LRB- then dramatic critic for the '' Times '' -RRB- often together .

		Haz - litt 's gift in painting , the author says , was remarkable . ''

		A portrait he took of his old nurse , a mere head , the upper part of the face in strong shadow from an over-pending black silk bonnet edged with lace , while the wrinkled cheeks , the lines about the mouth , with the touches of actual and reflected light , were given with such vigor and truth as well might recall the style of the renowned Flemish master , and actually did cause a good judge of the art to say to
Hazlitt	PERSON	, ' Where did you get that Rembrandt ? ' ''

		It was about a year after her marriage that Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	began her '' Concordance to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, '' which occupied her for six - teen years .

		She had already made certain minor essays in literature , in the shape of five brief papers published in Hone 's `` Table Book , '' to which serial Lamb also was a contributor .

		We may quote here from what she has to say , in closing , of her own relations with the author 's alleged natural enemy and Shylockian task - master , the publisher .

		218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, '' I may here take occasion to say that all my experi - ence of publishers has been most agreeable .

		Contrary to the prejudiced opinion sometimes expressed , that authors and publishers are often antagonistic in their transactions , I have invariably met with courtesy and kindness .

		... I must not omit to record that from American publishers I have also received tokens of marked regard .

		Messrs.
Munro	PERSON	,
Messrs. Roberts	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, Mr.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	, and Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, have each and all shown me much that proves the courtesy of publishers to authors . ''

		Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	has some kind words to say of Douglas Jerrold . ''

		Hardly a greater mistake could be made than to attribute bitterness or ill-nature to
Jerrold	PERSON	's sharpest sarcasms , as sometimes was the case by those who merely heard of them and did not know his real nature .

		We who did know him understood them better .

		He was deeply earnest in all serious things , and very much in earnest when dealing with less apparently important matters which he thought needed the scourge of a sar - casm .

		His concern for the object of his satirical quips was often at the root of them ; and he would pour forth his keen flights of pointed arrows chiefly with the view of rousing to improvement his butt , whom he knew capa - ble of better things , and on whom the shafts of his rid - icule might tell to good purpose rather than harm ... As a token of his belief that he was entirely understood and appreciated by my
Charles	PERSON	and me , I may mention that when he brought his ' Mrs.
Caudle	PERSON	's Lectures ' as a presentation copy to me , he had written in its blank page , Presented with great timidity , but equal regard , to Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, by
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	. ' ''

		Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's later chapters contain some interesting references to literary people , and artists of more modern vogue , whom she met at home and abroad ; but we must forbear transplanting any more of her `` purple patches '' to our own pages .

		Enough has been quoted , we trust , to send the reader expectantly to her pleasant little book .

		It contains a frankly , almost naively , told life-story , sweet with the pervading suggestion of sunny days , warm friends , and wholesome thoughts ; and might well bear on its dainty title-page as a motto the device on
Hazlitt	PERSON	's Venetian sun-dial : '' Horas non numero nisi serenas '' -LRB- I count only the hours that are serene -RRB- .

		The volume is prettily made and well printed though there are two or three unfortunate misprints , as '' match '' for march , on page 67 ; '' Murot '' for
Marot	PERSON	, on page 56 ; and '' Eanch 's '' for
Ranch	ORGANIZATION	's , on page 203 .

		There are several portraits , including an attractive one of the author .


E. G. J. Miss RUTH PUTNAM	PERSON	'S '' Life of William of Orange '' has been honored by a translation into Dutch and a pub - lication at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	, and its author by an election to the Society of Literature of the Netherlands -LRB- De Maats - chappy der

		BOOKS AND THEIR MAKERS .

		* That a good sized volume of four hundred and fifty pages may be written concerning books and their makers in the middle ages attests at least a considerable degree of mental activity during that period of time , even if most of such intellectual energy was result - ant in character , and not of a constructive and original quality .

		The medieval product in book manufacture appears truly enormous , when the means and methods are considered .

		The great collection of Muratori in
Italy	LOCATION	, of Dom Bouquet in
France	LOCATION	, the Rolls Series in
England	LOCATION	, the Monumenta of German history , not to speak of the vast body of writing comprised in
Migne	LOCATION	, all together comprise a mass of matter aggre - gating nearly four hundred folio volumes .

		One may reasonably expect a book about books to be bookish ; and the relative sterility of mediaeval thought may intensify that quality .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has been very bookish indeed .

		He has told us much that is of interest and profit , and has given much detail regarding the meth - ods of writing , the regime that prevailed in the monasteries , the work of the universities .

		But little is said of the men who wrote the books .

		In a word , the makers and the men receive a small amount of observation .

		Books are to our author the concrete substance rather than a potential personality .

		But the rationale of medieval thought is not so far removed from the manner of expression and preservation of that thought as the work before us has divorced them .

		A book is a personality , and much me - diaBval writing was original , even if crude .

		The maker is behind the thing made .

		A study of the condition of the production and distribu - tion of literature from the decline of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	also involves a study of condition and development of thought , and the personal his - tory of the men who formed that thought , as well as a consideration of resources and method of manufacture .

		The mere preservation of classic literature , the copying of the
Vulgate Bible	ORGANIZATION	and homilies of the church fathers , or the writing of saints ' lives , were not the whole devotion of mediaeval scribes .

		What of
Gregory of Tours	ORGANIZATION	and Nith - ard in Frankish history ?

		THE DIAL 219 history of the recovery by
Pertz	PERSON	of the lost man - uscript of Richer , mouldy and dilapidated , in the cathedral library of
Bamberg	LOCATION	, is a romantic story with the higher beauty of truth attached to it .

		Suger is remarkable as the earliest French chronicler to whom the advisability of using the French language instead of Latin , in the Chroniques de /
Saint-Denis	LOCATION	, suggested itself .

		Instead of the meagre paragraph in notice of Dunstan , whole pages might have been made luminous in telling of him .

		The man whose influence along intellectual lines pene - trated as far into later English history as the time of the Reformation was greater than the books written in
Glastonbury	LOCATION	, or than the cu - rious manuscript believed by some to have been wrought by
Dunstan	ORGANIZATION	's own finger - joints .

		As the history of modern book-making dates from
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	, so that of the middle ages must be dated from the establishment of the monastery of
Monte Cassino	ORGANIZATION	by
St. Benedict	ORGANIZATION	in 529 .

		The agencies to which were due the maintenance of intellectual interest and liter - ary activities during this period of nine centu - ries were three in number , and these three con - veniently separate the period into three stages . ''

		During the first , the responsibility for the preser - vation of the old-time literature , and for keeping alive some continuity of intellectual life , rested solely with the monasteries , and the work of multiplying and dis - tributing such books as had survived was carried on by the monks , and by them only .

		During the second stage , the older universities , the organization of which had gradually been developed from schools -LRB- themselves chiefly of monastic origin -RRB- , became centres of intellec - tual activity and shared with the monasteries the work of producing books .

		The books emanating from the university scribes were , however , for the most part re - stricted to a few special classes , classes which had , as a rule , not been produced in the monasteries and ... the university booksellers were in the earlier period not permitted to engage in any general distribution of books .

		With the third stage of manuscript literature , book - producing and book-selling machinery came into exist - ence in the towns , and the knowledge of reading being no longer confined to the cleric or the magister , books were prepared for the use of the large circles of the community , and to meet the requirements of such circles were , to an extent increasing with each generation , writ - ten in the tongue of the people '' -LRB- pp. 9-10 -RRB- .

		The preservation and dissemination of thought in the western world in the middle ages was almost wholly dependent upon the work of the monks .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	gives a full and exact account of the preparation of mate - rials and the process of writing .

		Since Mont - alembert .

		indebtedness to the '' Monks of the West '' for the preservation of the literary her - itage of
Europe	LOCATION	has been clearly recognized .

		That almost inspired clause in the Rule of
St. Benedict	LOCATION	, providing that '' He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers , '' saved
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		It directed the entire intel - lectual activity of the time and much of the physical energy .

		The monk was a civilizer .

		He built his retreat by a marsh or in a forest because it was trial so to live .

		The Rule re - quired him to labor , and if he did not write he labored with his hands , draining the fens and cutting down the forest .

		Not a little of the intellectual product , however , of the monks was due to negative motives .

		It was a common form of penance particularly in the darkest period , the ninth and tenth centuries to im - pose the writing of a certain amount of '' copy '' ; and slovenly work the writer sometimes made of it .

		The variant readings in classic litera - ture which to-day vex and perplex scholars are many of them due to the carelessness of some half-hearted or disciplined inmate of a monas - tery , who , working away in a cold cell unpro - vided with means of warmth , and with only winter daylight struggling through the narrow casement , had no regard for the matter he was copying , and little regard for the manner in which he was writing .

		Of the ancient classics ,
Cicero	PERSON	and Aristotle were most earnestly read .

		A valuable para - graph is this : '' The fact that , during the manuscript period and the first two centuriess of printing , the writings of
Cicero	LOCATION	were reproduced far more largely than those of any other of the Roman writers , is interesting as indicating a distinct literary preference on the part of successive generations both of producers and of readers .

		The pre - eminence of Aristotle in the lists of the mediseval issues of the Greek classics has , I judge , a different signifi - cance .

		Aristotle stood for a school of philosophy , the teachings of which , in the main , had been accepted by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and the copies of his writings were required for the use of students .

		The continued demand for the works of Cicero depended upon no such adventitious aid , and can , therefore , fairly be credited to their per - ennial value as literature '' -LRB- p. xii . -RRB-

		.

		But as the
New Europe	LOCATION	opened , and
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	faded into the background , while the dogmatic theology of the Church developed , the classic writers came to be looked upon askance . ''

		What do we want , '' wrote
S. Eligius	PERSON	in the eighth century , '' with the so-called philosophies of
Pythagoras	ORGANIZATION	,
Socrates	LOCATION	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and Aristotle , or with the rubbish and nonsense of such shame - less poets as
Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	, and Merander ? ''


Vergil	ORGANIZATION	became a name to conjure with .

		Syl - vester II .

		was looked upon as a necromancer , because of his love for classic literature ; while the writings of
Sallust	LOCATION	,
Livy	PERSON	,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, and 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
Demosthenes	PERSON	became almost as unknown as the realm of Prester
John	PERSON	.

		Honorius wrote in the twelfth century : '' It grieves me when I con - sider in my mind the number of persons who , having lost their senses , are not ashamed to give their utmost labor to the investigation of the abominable figments of the poets and the captious arguments of the philosophers which are wont inextricably to bind the mind that is drawn away from God in the bonds of vices , and to be ignorant of the Christian profession whereby the soul may come to reign everlast - ingly with God ... Moreover , how is the soul profited by the strife of Hector , or the argumentation of Plato , or the poems of Ver - gil , or the elegies of
Ovid	LOCATION	? ''

		And so it was for four centuries .

		The Church confounded the truth with its interpretation of truth .

		But while St.
Bernard	PERSON	, the arch-advocate of this manner of thinking , was living ,
Abelard	PERSON	was also de - claring the right of liberty of thought and lib - erty of the spirit .

		After all , the narrowness of thought in this time was not unmixed with good .

		There was much that was incorrigible in the Germanic stock .

		Feudalism was the political drill-master of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Men needed a rod of iron across their backs .

		So , too , the dogmatism of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, its bigotry and intolerance , had virtue in it .

		In an age when everything tended to divide
Europe	LOCATION	into a chaos of jarring fragments , the Church was one in theory , in government , in faith , in language .

		Its unity had to be pre - served at any cost , until young
Europe	LOCATION	might become united enough to stand .

		When that time came , dogmatism and scholasticism and dialectics had taught men how to think ; the new culture of the Renaissance was to give the now trained mind of
Europe	LOCATION	new matter to think about .

		As truth broadened , the ways of looking at things could then safely broaden too .

		The author is occasionally led astray by un - familiarity with details of general history .

		No '' Roman gentleman in far-off
Britain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. vii . -RRB-

		ever ordered , or could have ordered , a copy of '' the latest ode of
Horace	PERSON	, '' for the reason that
Britain	LOCATION	did not become a Roman province until after the Christian era .

		Is not
Boethius	PERSON	entitled to as much credit -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- as Isidore for intro - ducing to
Europe	LOCATION	of the Middle Ages the teach - ings of philosophy ?

		On p. 38 the author apparently uses the words '' rule of the Lom - bards '' to mean the
Lombard Italy	LOCATION	of the tenth century .

		On p. 55 we read : ''
England	LOCATION	, con - verted by her monks , has special reason to be proud of the historians furnished by her abbeys .

		One chronicler ,
Gildas	LOCATION	, has painted with fiery touches the miseries of Great -LSB- ! -RSB-


Britain	LOCATION	after the departure of the Romans . ''

		Confusion worse confounded !

		Gildas was a monk of the
British Church	ORGANIZATION	, a Briton dwelling in
Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- not '' Great ''

England	LOCATION	nor English .

		Ingulph of Croyland is a forgery , and not , as Mr.

Horsa	PERSON	landed in 449 , not 451 -LRB- p. 93 -RRB- .

		This statement is not clear to me : '' During the long years of invasion and of civil war , the literary interests and culture that had come to the Saxons had been in great part swept away '' -LRB- p. 98 -RRB- .

		Is it to be understood that the term '' civil war '' refers to the wars of the different petty English kingdoms with one another ?

		And what amount of '' literary inter - ests and culture '' came to the Saxons through
Rome	LOCATION	until the missionaries of Gregory the Great ?

		There is curiously little notice of the destruction of monasteries and manuscripts by the
Danes	PERSON	. ''

		And , finally , is not this a fancy ? ''

		The school at Tours -LSB- under Charles the Great -RSB- may be considered as a precursor of the French Academy of mod - ern times '' -LRB- p. 107 -RRB- .

		It is to be hoped that Mr.

France	LOCATION	,
Casaubon	PERSON	,
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, the
Kobergers of Nuremberg	ORGANIZATION	, Eras - mus , Luther as an author , the Elzevirs of the Low Countries , and the great Italian galaxy , and so splendid in ideas freedom of the press and the conception of personal property in lit - erature will embrace this large spirit already indicated in the history of books and authors .

		Books which are worth anything are not merely books , but a part of the body of literature .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's personal experience has doubt - less led him to dwell upon the making of books rather than upon the makers .

		There is such a thing as sympathy with books apart from the authors thereof .

		It certainly was no intentional slight , but simply an illustration of the prin - ciple that knowledge even of a particular sub - ject is too vast and too subtle to be comprised between the covers of one volume .

		THE ART OF WRITING .

		* It is hard to see just who can use the many text - books now being published on rhetoric and English composition , for every teacher has written one himself -LRB- or is writing one -RRB- , and , if only out of self-respect , must use it with his classes to the exclusion of the rest .

		That is , every teacher has his peculiar way of looking at the subject , his own way of teaching it , that makes it impossible for him to approve of any - body else 's way .

		We have all of us wandered far from
Aristotle	LOCATION	, but there has arisen no
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	.

		There is no name of pre - eminent greatness among modern writers on rhetoric , no one system of post-Aristotelian method that compels attention .

		Every man says whatever is right in his own eyes .

		There was a time , long since , when there was a more or less definitely accepted system of rhetoric ; but even in such palmy days the system was not very systematic .

		In fact , the rhetorician -LRB- if the teacher or student of good writing will accept that name of hissing and reproach -RRB- , the rhetorician has almost always been like that distinguished master of the art who aroused complaint because he not only had '' nothing so finite as a system , '' but not even any principles which were '' coherent , inter - dependent , subordinate , and derivative . ''

		In place of a system , the modern student has good usagef ; in place of logically developed princi - ples , the rhetorician substitutes whatever rules of practice his own reading and writing recom - mend to him .

		There is perfect freedom on the king 's highway , and everyone may ride along on his hobby at the gait that seems most pleasant .

		Hence -LRB- finally to fetch a compass , and get around to our subject -RRB- , it is not easy to criti - cise Professor
Arlo Bates	PERSON	's '' Talks on Writing English , '' as he rightly says a book should be criticised , namely by measuring it with a de - fined standard .

		There is no defined standard , be - cause there is no system of rhetoric , or English composition -LRB- if that be the better name -RRB- , which compels consistency , and no theorist who com - * TALKS ON WRITING ENGLISH .

		With a good deal of this book I disagree , but not because it differs from any accepted standard ; merely because it differs from my own idea of how the thing should be done .

		It must be remarked , however , that Mr.
Bates	PERSON	's book does not pretend to be a system - atic treatment of rhetoric .

		It is not a college text-book , but a book for more general reading .

		It is not a guide to instruction , but a discussion of the subject of good writing .

		As appears from the name , it is not a systematic treatise , but a series of '' talks , '' or somewhat informal lectures .

		For writing such a book , Mr.
Bates	PERSON	has very eminent qualifications : he is at once a man of letters and a college professor ; he has also been an editor .

		He is entitled to be heard on the ars utens and the ars docens .

		While he has the skill and confidence of the artist , he is not unacquainted with academic tradition nor with the needs and uses of the market-place .

		What we have here is a prac - tical discussion of the art of writing by a writer who , while devoted to literature , has had the privilege of being led into the temptation to become a pedant on the one hand and a man of affairs on the other , and has resisted both temp - tations .

		His book , therefore , has the advantage of teaching by example as well as by precept .

		It is encouraging to learn of a man who can do the thing himself .

		Illogical though it be , one does feel as though a teacher ought to be able to do the thing he teaches .

		It is true that a man may know what good writing is and how it is to be attained , and yet not be able to write especially well himself .

		But one feels safer with a man who can ; one feels safer , and then , also , one finds it more amusing .

		This book is written in a happy and interesting way , so that it is a pleasure to read it .

		If anything , it goes a little too far : there are not a few pas - sages that please one until one asks , '' What has all this to do with the matter in hand ? ''

		That is natural in the work of an imaginative writer : he does not readily confine himself to mere didactics ; his ideas have more than the mere facts to them .

		I take it , the book is meant for people adopt - ing literature as a profession ; certainly the greater part of the book will appeal to such a public .

		There is another book on English com - position of something the same character as this one , and the publishers tell us that it is amaz - ingly successful with college classes .

		But it is hard to think of this book 's being used as a 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, text - book ; a good teacher could do excellent work with it , of course , as with several dozen others .

		But it does not especially address stu - dents ; the four chapters on narration , for instance , are written with an eye to short stories and novels , and there is slight use in trying to teach college men in general to write short stories or novels .

		It seems to be the '' young aspirant for literary honors '' who will get the most good from these talks .

		Such a one I can imagine reading the book with intense interest , keeping it by him and referring to it often , up - braiding it for its rigor and trying hard to real - ize its felicities .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	says he has tried to state those things which would have been most helpful to him twenty years ago ; his book will be most useful to those who have in mind a career in the same direction as the author 's .

		It is , perhaps , ungracious to be dissatisfied with a book for not being what it never intended to be , and yet -LRB- to harp again upon an old chord -RRB- I read modern books on writing English with a regret that they do not at least attempt a thorough authoritative study of the phenomena of the expression of thought in letters .

		Beyond such and such a point , one may say , analysis can not go ; and this is true of your analysis if you can make it go no farther .

		But I have great faith in the determined energy of the scholar , which is something that this book lacks something , indeed , to which it hardly pre - tends .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	says that a professional is a person who has learned how to do a thing , while an amateur is one who has not .

		He is certainly a professional writer himself , and he shows how another can learn something at least of his profession .

		But there is a good deal of difference between learning how to do a thing and learning how a thing is done .

		Let a pro- fessional be one who knows how to do a thing ; the scholar always wants to know how a thing is done .

		We have already many books that teach how to write ; no new one adds very much to our ideas .

		What we want now is something that gets to the root of the matter .

		Perhaps it is a dangerous experiment .

		The great delight of good writing lies in its charm ; it is , of course , not wise for your enchanter to explain just how he manages his wonders .

		To try to snatch off the magic robe is perhaps too like destroying the last reserve anywhere else : you do it at your peril .

		And yet , one always longs to scale a mountain ; there is surely some - thing splendid to be seen from the top .

		A FAMOUS FAMILY OF SINGERS .

		* Mr.
John W. Hutchinson	PERSON	, the sole survivor of the famous ''
Hutchinson	PERSON	Family '' of sing - ers and musicians , has told their interesting story in two large octavo volumes , with fifty - seven illustrations .

		In
1874	DATE	,
Joshua Hutch	PERSON	- inson , an older brother , published a '' Brief Narrative '' of the family ; but this was inade - quate , and in response to frequent requests from friends in all parts of the country the present work appears .

		The first volume concludes with the year
1869	DATE	, and partly because of the period covered , partly because of a certain spon - taneity and freshness in the manner of telling which are lacking in the second is by all odds the more interesting and important .

		The story is too long drawn out , and the almost infinite number of details grows tiresome .

		The little homely incidents and anecdotes related in the first part are of value as side-lights to the his - tory of that early time in
New England	LOCATION	.

		We are even interested to hear just how the belong - ings of the quartet were disposed on their first tour , how the violins , without cases , were hung up inside the carryall , the bass-viol was strapped on top , while the little hair-trunk con - taining Abby 's simple wardrobe was safely stowed away on the rack .

		But we care less to be informed how
John	PERSON	spent each day at the World 's Fair , of the old friends he met , and what they said .


Jesse	PERSON	and
Mary Hutchinson	PERSON	, of
Milford	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, were the parents of sixteen chil - dren , of whom thirteen grew to maturity .

		The father and mother were both musical , and mel - ody was a part of the atmosphere of their home .

		Parker
Pillsbury	ORGANIZATION	was much impressed by an incident that occurred in
1844	DATE	, while he was a guest of the Hutchinsons .

		After breakfast , the father was about to start for his labor in the fields , when one of the boys asked him if they should not sing him a farewell .

		The father paused , and the dozen sons and daughters , led by
Jesse	PERSON	, the oldest , sang : '' Our father , we - wish you well .

		When our Lord calls , we hope you will be mentioned in the promised land . ''

		To this prayer the father responded , in sonor - ous and earnest tones : '' My children , I wish you well .

		When our Lord calls , I trust you will be mentioned in the promised land . ''

		THE DIAL 223 son family was on Thanksgiving evening ,
1839	DATE	, when the eleven sons and two daughters de - lighted the
Milford	LOCATION	people with a free concert in the
Baptist Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		A little later , the quartet , destined to fame on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, started out ; they were
Judson	PERSON	,
John	PERSON	,
Asa	LOCATION	, and
Abby	PERSON	, and were christened by Mr.
N. P. Rogers	PERSON	'' a nest of brothers with a sister in it . ''

		Abby was then only eleven years old ; but she proved a drawing card , her voice being rarely musical , and she herself a most charm - ing creature .

		A few years ago ,
Abby	PERSON	, with her husband , Mr.
Ludlow Patton	PERSON	, visited
Santa Fe	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	, where the writer was then living , and sang in the hotel parlors .

		It is no exaggera - tion to say that , although nearly sixty , she still retained the engaging manner and spiritual beauty of her youth , and that her voice had lost none of its rich melody .

		She was a beau - tiful and noble woman , always the idol of her brothers , and probably the most highly gifted of the family .

		The tender solicitude and love of all for this youngest blossom are constantly shown in these volumes .

		She early abandoned the concert field , being married in
1849	DATE	, and afterwards appearing in public only at rare intervals and on very special occasions .

		Of her appearance in
1845	DATE	, when she went to
Great Britain	LOCATION	with her brothers , Mr.
Frank B. Car	PERSON	- penter gave a very interesting account : '' When the evening came for the opening concert , the
Hanover	LOCATION	Square Rooms were crowded by a gather - ing of prominent literary and musical people .

		Abby , modestly attired in white , was radiant with happiness and intelligence .

		It was something new to behold one so modest , so artless , commanding the attention of En - glish audiences .

		She won the hearts of all .

		Her voice was full and clear , and her execution faultless .

		Her singing of
Tennyson 's May Queen	ORGANIZATION	' had a heavenly charm .

		The first part was sung with such exuberance of youthful joy and hope as to win the instant uncon - trolled applause of the audience .

		The second part in sad and mournful strains carried home the words of this pathetic song to every heart .

		It seemed an angel 's voice whispering to the dying
May	DATE	Queen peace and resigna - tion .

		It was the passing of a spirit to that heaven where the sun of righteousness forever shines .

		She lifted the audience to a state of unparalleled exaltation .

		The next day the press of
London	LOCATION	rang with the praises of the American Singers . ''

		But the greatest work of the Hutchinsons , and that in which they won their chief fame , was in the anti-slavery field .

		They were aboli - tionists from the very beginning of their career . ''

		The Old Granite State '' was the song with which they opened their concerts ; but there were always such stirring melodies as '' The Slave 's Appeal , '' Get Off the Track , '' and
Whittier	LOCATION	's anti-slavery verses .


Nathaniel P. Eogers	PERSON	, always a warm friend , wrote of their appearance at one of the great abolition meet - ings in
Boston	LOCATION	: '' They made the vast multitude toss and heave and clamor like the roaring ocean .

		Orpheus is said to have made the trees dance at his playing .

		The Hutchinsons made the thousands at
Faneuil Hall	ORGANIZATION
spring	DATE	to their feet simultaneously , ` as if in a dance , ' and echo the anti-slavery appeal with a cheering that almost moved the old Revolutionists from their stations on the wall .

		...
Phillips	PERSON	had been speaking in his happiest vein .

		It was toward night .

		The old hall was sombre in the gloaming .

		It was thronged to its vast extremities .

		Phillips closed his speech at the highest pitch of his fine genius , and retired from the platform , when the four brothers -LRB-
Jesse	PERSON	,
Judson	LOCATION	,
John	PERSON	, and Asa -RRB- rushed to his place , and took up the argument where he had left it , on the very heights of poetic declamation , and carried it heavenwards on one of their boldest flights .


Jesse	PERSON	had framed a series of stanzas on the spot , while
Phillips	PERSON	was speaking , embodying the leading arguments , and enforcing them , as mere oratory can not , as music and poetry only can , and they poured them forth with amaz - ing spirit , in one of the maddening Second Advent tunes .

		The vast multitude sprang to their feet , as one man , and at the close of the first strain gave vent to their enthusiasm in a thunder of unrestrained cheering .

		Three cheers , and three times three , and ever so many more , for they could not count they sent out , full - hearted and full-toned , till the old roof rang again .

		And throughout the whole succeeding strains they re - peated it , not allowing the singers to complete half the stanza before breaking out upon them in incontrollable emotion . ''

		Such was their singing , and such was its effect .

		No wonder they were lionized in the North and hated in the South .

		Their work brought them in contact with all the great re - formers of that golden period , and many pre - cious friendships were formed .

		They sang in all parts of the country , to the soldiers in camp , to President Lincoln at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, to great audiences in all our large cities ; and though praised and flattered without stint , they remained the same simple , unaffected band of Yankee singers , pouring themselves forth in music that was as natural as breathing .

		Jud - son 's voice was a pure tenor ,
John	PERSON	's a baritone ,
Asa	PERSON	's a deep bass , while Abby sang contralto .

		The voices blended so perfectly that it was quite impossible to distinguish the several parts , and such exquisite harmony is seldom attained by long years of practice .

		The wives of
Judson	PERSON	and Asa and
John	PERSON	were all singers , and since the war there have been so many different tribes of Hutchinsons singing in various parts of the country as to prompt a
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts paper to declare , a few years ago : '' The
Hutchinson	PERSON	Family , which has been giving concerts since the flood , and about one hundred of which have died , is singing away as though 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, nothing had happened , up in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the three brothers who sang with
Abby	PERSON	, perhaps the most interesting was
Judson	PERSON	, the eleventh child , '' dear , impulsive , noble
Jud	PERSON	- son , '' as Garrison called him .

		He had more of what is termed genius than any of the others .

		Possessed of rare ventriloqual powers , he was able in such songs as '' Excelsior '' to produce wonderful effect .

		Of a nervous , high-strung temperament , he was always inclined to mel - ancholy ; yet humor and satire were curiously blended in him .

		He is said to have possessed what is commonly known as '' second-sight , '' and some strange illustrations of this gift are given in the present work .

		Living through that stimulating period of moral awakening of which the anti-slavery movement was the strongest outbreak , when , as Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	says , '' it was in as bad taste for a poor man to have but one hobby in his head as for a rich man to keep but one horse in his stable , '' the Hutchinsons were not absorbed in the anti-slavery movement to the exclusion of other reforms .

		They sang with equal zest in behalf of peace , temperance , and woman 's enfranchisement .

		Judson adopted new notions with all the ardor of an enthusi - astic nature , going about in socks , because he did not believe in wearing any garment that necessitated the killing of animals , and being a most devoted Grahamite .

		The rest of the family laughed at
Judson	LOCATION	's idiosyncrasies , but he was the one they all loved most .

		His mind , like many another so sensitively attuned , be - came really unbalanced during the last years of his life , and in a period of depression he hanged himself .

		Each of this band of singers is interesting in his way ; they all had strongly pronounced personalities , and may be taken as types of the
New England	LOCATION	character of their time .

		All but one have passed over to the great unknown ; and it was fitting that this last of the sixteen , lingering now '' among new men , strange faces , other minds , '' should tell the story of the picturesque band who rendered such val - iant service to the cause of humanity in the days that tried men 's souls .

		SOCIAL FORCES ix GERMAN TJITERATURE .

		* Since Herder put forth the doctrine that literature is only one of many manifestations of national life , a century passed before the writ - ers of histories of literature learned to apply to their work the natural conclusions of the doc - trine , and to keep their readers always in sight of the reality behind the manifestation .

		No history of literature is satisfactory to-day unless it is more or less a philosophy of literature .

		Of course it is not possible within practicable limits to display at every moment the whole of the national life together with its literary pro- duct .

		The reader must be familiar already with the outlines of the general history .

		Taine , in the Introduction to his '' English Litera - ture , '' makes the race , the surroundings , and the epoch the essential features which he would keep in sight of his readers ; but he hardly carries out his programme as to the last of these .

		We see constantly the full-feeding , pug - nacious
Saxon	PERSON	and his foggy green island , but not much of the popular , intellectual , and polit - ical life of an epoch .

		Scherer , in his '' Ger - man Literature , '' as in a well-constructed his - torical novel , keeps the dynastic history evident in the background , but does not hold his read - ers well in touch with the great social move - ments of the nation .

		In deciding what phases of the nation 's life to portray along with its literature , it is inev - itable that a writer have a theory and follow a principle .

		This Dr.
Francke	PERSON	has done in his study of '' Social Forces in German Litera - ture . ''

		He endeavors to keep always in mind the prime tendencies in the social and intel - lectual life of the period , and especially the parallel expressions of these tendencies in phi - losophy and art .

		He sees these tendencies striving between the poles of individualism and collectivism , finding perfection on the indi - vidualistic side in the great masters of the eighteenth century , and moving even now to - ward a collectivistic harmony .

		If the effort to discover these tendencies in all interesting works of German literature seems occasionally a little forced , on the whole it must be admitted by even the most determined casualist that the theory is luminous .

		For the first time , Ger - man literature has been depicted with a spirit that imparts to it organic unity .

		We have not , then , a mere old-fashioned chronological list of * SOCIAL FORCES IN GERMAN LITERATURE .

		A Study in the
History of Civilization	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Kuno Francke	PERSON	, Ph .

Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 225 German authors , with brief biographies and extracts , such as might serve for cramming in a civil service examination ; and yet few works of importance fail to receive mention , while the excellent index and bibliographic foot-notes make the volume a satisfactory hand-book for college classes pursuing the outline of the sub - ject .

		Doubtless Dr.
Francke	PERSON	had no thought of supplanting
Scherer	PERSON	, but he has certainly produced an indispensable supplement to that or any other standard history of German litera - ture .

		Notwithstanding what has just been said of the pursuit of a theory , and the disclaimer in the Preface of any pretensions to purely liter - ary criticism , this book is rich in well-weighed , condensed judgments of writers , and in dis - criminating , yet enthusiastic , appreciations of the best qualities in their masterpieces .

		For instance , in speaking of the Court Epics our author says : '' There is no background to most of these poems .

		In reading them we feel as if we were seeing a mirage .

		... However varied and fantastic the armours and garments of these lords and ladies are , almost all their faces look alike ; however wild the forests , however gor - geous the ravines , we do not hear the wind rustle in the leaves or the water roaring in its
fall	DATE	.

		And over the unending succession of fashionable happenings , of gal - lant tournaments , of love-scenes both delicate and frivo - lous , of bold abductions and miraculous escapes , we entirely lose sight of the real forces and the true mean - ing of life . ''

		Here is a much-needed correction of a cur - rent error regarding what are called Popular Lyrics and Epics -LRB- Volkslieder , VolTcsepen -RRB- : '' No doubt there is a great deal of truth in the asser - tion that the Volkslied is property and product of the whole nation ... And yet it is equally certain that each Volkslied , in its original form , is property and product of an individual poet , and is the result of indi - vidual and personal experiences .

		If this were not self - evident , the German folk-songs of the fourteenth , fif - teenth , and sixteenth centuries would give ample proof of it . ''

		As an illustration of Dr.
Francke	PERSON	's method , I submit several extracts from his treatment of Luther and the Reformation . ''

		The history of the German people in
the sixteenth century	DATE	presents a strange and sad spectacle .

		At the beginning of the period
Germany	LOCATION	, of all European na - tions , shows the highest intellectual promise ... Great men are standing up for a great cause .

		Coper - nicus is pointing toward an entirely new conception of the physical universe .

		Erasmus and
Hutten	PERSON	,
Holbein	PERSON	and Diirer ,
Melanchthon	PERSON	and Luther , each in his own sphere , are preparing the way for a new and higher form of national life .

		It seems as though a strong and free German state , a golden age of German art and lit - erature , were near at hand .

		At the end of the century all these hopes are crushed .

		While
England	LOCATION	is enter - ing the Elizabethan era , while the Dutch are fighting the most glorious struggle of modern times for free thought and free government ,
Germany	LOCATION	, the mother - land of religious liberty , is hopelessly lost in the conflict between Jesuit and Protestant fanaticism , and is grad - ually drifting toward the abyss of the Thirty Years ' War . ''

		Such is the introduction to the chapter the statement of the question .

		After an analysis of Humanism and of Luther 's greater works , Dr.
Francke	PERSON	prepares for a resume : '' We have already spoken of the causes which be - tween
1525	DATE	and
1530	DATE	, brought the Reformation move - ment to a standstill and checked the upward , idealistic current of German literature .

		To say it once more : the chief reason was the absence in the
Germany	LOCATION	of the sixteenth century of a strong national will , of an en - lightened public opinion ... The result was that the religious Reformation , instead of being borne along by an irresistible tide of national enthusiasm , was forced into the narrow channels of local fanaticism ... And thus it came about that at the very time -LRB- 1530 -RRB- when the
Augsburg	LOCATION	Confession , the official form of the Pro- testant belief , was definitely fixed , Protestantism had ceased to represent , what in the beginning it had stood for , the deepest hopes and highest aspirations of a united people . '' ''

		Luther himself ended by abandoning the ideals of his early manhood .

		He had broken with the old sacred tradition ; he had rejected all outward helps to salva - tion ; he had placed himself on his own ground , alone in all the world , trusting in the personal guidance and pro- tection of God .

		As a result of his own teaching he now saw the country transformed into a surging sea , tossed , as it seemed to him , by evil doctrines and pernicious contests .

		Had it , then , really been the voice of God that called him ?

		... He can only answer these terri - ble questionings by a blind and implicit faith .

		He comes forth from the struggle , not as he entered it , strong in intellectual fearlessness , but strong in stubborn adher - ence to a chosen authority ; not any longer the champion of reason , but as its defamer . '' ''

		And yet how different the intellectual history of
Germany	LOCATION	and of the world would have been if the man who had given the German people the idea of universal priesthood , who had called on them to fling away the form in order to save the substance of religion , who had grounded the religious life upon individual belief and individual reason , had not ended as the founder of a new orthodoxy and a new absolutism . ''

		It is manifest , in the extracts already given , that the judgments of the author are not mere re - wordings of the opinions of standard critics .

		Every page bears witness to his inde - pendence .

		But it is an independence based evi - dently upon broad and careful knowledge , and will therefore attract and interest in its concur - rence as well as in its dissent .

		Among dissenting positions is what is meant to be a '' Rettung '' of Klopstock .

		In the opinion that '' the time will certainly come when even the narrative part of the Messias will again , as in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's youth , find readers willing to let themselves be 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, carried along by its powerful and sonorous , though sometimes monotonous , flow of oratory , '' Dr.
Francke	PERSON	will probably find few sympa - thizers , least of all , if we may credit a recent report , from one of his colleagues in the En - glish department .

		It is not possible within the limits of this review to do justice to Dr.
Francke	PERSON	's treatment of the great writers of the eighteenth century .

		In general , there is here much more of literary criticism than in other parts of the book .

		While there is a conscientious , and , as it seems to me , thoroughly successful , attempt to do jus - tice to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the author 's sympathies are plainly with
Schiller	PERSON	.

		He admires
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, he loves
Schiller	PERSON	.

		For instance , your genuine Goethe worshipper would not be satisfied to have this said of ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' : '' We feel as though we could not breathe in this atmosphere , as though there was no chance for activity in a social order in which the main interests of modern German life , a national dynasty , a national parliament , problems of national organization , defence and self - assertion , had no part .

		We even feel something akin to contempt for these men and women who keep a most scrupulous account of their own precious emotions , who bestow the most serious consideration upon a host of insignificant trifles , and who , at the same time , only too often are found erring in the simplest questions of right and wrong . ''

		Yet the novel is by no means herewith con - demned .

		With great care its undoubted merits and historical significance are pointed out .

		But when Dr.
Francke	PERSON	turns to
Schiller	PERSON	's charac - ters , he says : '' If they are sometimes lacking in that instinctive sympathy with human nature as it is which distinguishes all of Shakspere 's and nearly all of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's work , they compensate for this by their splendid enthusiasm for human nature as it ought to be . ''

		Rarely , as in the case of Richter , there seems to be an incomplete reconciliation of the hith - erto prevailing opinion , and the author 's own , and both appear .

		For instance : '' In him -LSB-
Jean Paul -RSB-	PERSON	, it seemed , the ideal of an har - monious , all-embracing individuality had taken bodily form and come to walk among men .

		There probably never was a poet who felt more deeply and with more personal ardor than
Jean Paul	PERSON	the unity of all life .

		His loving eye lingered with the same calm serenity upon the smallest and the greatest .

		His life was filled with that profound and joyous awe which springs from a strong and abiding sense of the infinite and which is man 's best part . ' ''

		But a few pages farther on occur these bewil - dering , though certainly just , judgments : '' How could he help being devoid of the moral soundness and vigor which is the fruit of individual tal - ent exercised in the service of a common cause ? '' ''

		His real interest lay , not in the universal and the normal , but in the exceptional and the abnormal , in the capricious and the diseased . '' ''

		It is indeed well-nigh impossible for the modern reader to find his way through the labyrinthine tangle of
Jean Paul	PERSON	's imagination .

		These enchanted forests of wild adventure and mysterious chance , these dreary des - erts of recondite learning , these gloomy caverns of mys - tic contemplation , these cataracts of untamed emotion , how strange and bewildering it all is ! ''

		What a blessed feeling of relief these last par - agraphs must bring to many a docile literary conscience confused in its vain attempts to bring the hitherto required tribute to
Richter	ORGANIZATION	's shrine !

		But I have said and quoted enough to arouse in every friend of German literature the de - sire to possess this interesting volume .

		The style is clear , crisp , and unobtrusive , and de - spite the modest apology of the Preface , would probably betray to no one not on the alert for evidence the fact that the author left
Germany	LOCATION
less than fifteen years ago	DATE	.

		The proof has been read with great care , the few errors being mostly immaterial , and the publishers have given a handsome and dignified outfitting to what is destined to be a standard work for both professional and general uses .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		The treatment ^ e have several times had occasion of Nature in to commend academic dissertations English poetry .

		pu bli s hed by the
English Department of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such work as has been done in this field by Dr.
Lewis	PERSON	, Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	, and Dr.
Triggs	PERSON	exhibits in a very high degree the thor - oughness and the painstaking industry that we have a right to expect from the university thesis , although we do not always get it .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has set a high standard in this matter , and the lat - est English monograph that has issued from this institution certainly does not derogate from that standard .

		It is the work of Miss
Myra Reynolds	PERSON	, and has for its subject '' The
Treatment of Nature	ORGANIZATION	in English Poetry between Pope and
Wordsworth	PERSON	. ''

		The author has evidently read , note-book in hand , the main body of eighteenth-century poetry , a large part of the fiction , and not a little of the literature of travel of the period .

		Her monograph fills 290 octavo pages , crammed with illustrative facts and phrases , and bristling with references as becomes a dissertation ; yet graceful in manner and extremely readable , wherein it differs from most works of its class .

		She gives us , first , '' a general statement of the chief characteristics that marked the treatment of nature under the dominance of the English clas - sical poets , '' then a detailed study of those poets in whose writings we may find germs of the conception

		THE DIAL 227 of nature that was to burst into full flower with
Wordsworth	PERSON	and his contemporaries ; and , finally , brief special chapters on the landscape gardening , the fiction , the books of travel , and the landscape painting of the eighteenth century .

		The work is essentially a study in literary evolution , and contrib - utes an important chapter to the new history of our literature , the work of many hands , that is slowly emerging , and that will , when completed , be as dif - ferent from the earlier annalistic treatment as Ly - ell 's '' Geology '' was different from the catastrophic geology of his predecessors . ''

		Before
Wordsworth	PERSON	, most of his characteristic thoughts on nature had received fairly explicit statement . ''

		This sentence , taken from the last page of Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	's essay , is amply justified by the pages that go before , and may be taken as striking the keynote of her work .

		A study in ^ '' The Authorship of the King ` is Old Scottish Quair , '' by
J. T. T. Brown	PERSON	, we have Literature .

		what > if pu bli s hed in
Germany	LOCATION	, would be a simple dissertation or programme , a thin pam - phlet sold for a mark .

		As brought out by the Pub - lishers to the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	, however , it appears in a much more imposing and sumptuous dress .

		Internally , there is not so much difference of spirit ; the book is an argument to show that the old Scotch poem of '' The King ` is Quair '' was not written by
James I.	PERSON	, as has been commonly sup - posed .

		The view has not been universally accepted ; indeed , there has been a running fire of criticism and correspondence on the subject throughout the past
summer	DATE	.

		We have not space at hand even to sum - marize the argument ; and on other terms , an opin - ion on the outcome would hardly be of value .

		The case practically rests on six points : first , the poem is not by
James	PERSON	, because the earliest ascription to him is of doubtful value ; because the testimonies to his poetical ability are not convincing , while the silence of authoritative writers weighs heavily against it ; because there is no sufficient reason to suppose that
James	PERSON	, who was captured by the English when only twelve , would or could have written Lowland Scotch before he was released , and because of some errors as to the facts of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's life which seem to be borrowed from
Wyntoun	LOCATION	's Chronicle ; second , the poem is of a later date than
James	PERSON	, because it has several characteristics of the Scotch of the lat -
ter half of the century	DATE	, and because it is evidently written with some reference to '' The Court of Love . ''

		Stated thus baldly , these reasons do not , of course , have the weight given by fuller treatment ; but scholars will be able to see the direction of the ar - gument .

		Our own opinion is that the last two points are the only ones of much value : if '' The King ` is Quair '' were written after '' The Court of Love '' -LRB- about 1450 -RRB- , if the rhymes show that its language is of the latter part of the century , it is not probable that it was written by
James I.	PERSON	, who died in
1437	DATE	.

		But we can not regard the parallelisms with '' The Court of Love '' as wholly convincing ; and as to the showing of the language to be late fifteenth century , our author prefers '' to leave the task to others bet - ter qualified , '' a modest and laudable proceeding , but not convincing or persuasive as an argument .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		It is quite certain that few of us get as much as we might out of the picture-galleries and museums of our large cities ; and particularly is this apt to be the case with regard to collections of casts from the antique .

		Most people feel as though '' the chisel of Phidias '' was a something not wholly unfamiliar to them , but too often one 's ideas upon the art of Phi - dias are based merely upon the Psyche and Flying Mercury we happen to have in the parlor , and vague recollections of the Venus of Melos and the Apollo Belvedere .

		In rendering more popular the knowl - edge of Greek sculpture and indicating its possibil - ities , we can hardly overrate the value of a book like the '' Catalogue of the Casts of Greek and Roman Sculpture in the Museum of Fine Arts '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , prepared by Mr.
Edward Robinson	PERSON	, Cur - ator of Classical Antiquities , and now in its third and revised edition -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		We speak prin - cipally of the value of this book , not merely to those who walk about the galleries of casts and want to know what this or that may be , but to anyone who wants to know about Greek sculpture , for the book gives a careful discussion of each statue .

		It has its value to scholars also , both in its opinions and its indications of literature ; but for popular use the book is especially adapted , and such use it will serve admirably .

		Even if the reader be not able to go to the Museum and see the casts in question , the book will furnish him with a guide to study , or , if no more , with much useful information .

		And , after all , Greek sculpture is something that one should have at least some little notion of , if only for the part it plays in every-day literature or conversation .

		True , most of us can appreciate that strange remark found by Longfellow somewhere , '' Her arms were as lovely as those of the
Venus di Milo	PERSON	, '' but how many see why that friend of
Emerson	LOCATION	's insisted that the
Rondanini Medusa	LOCATION	was really a Mnemosyne ?

		The earliest ^ s a sidelight upon the history of our American country and its earlier conditions , the architect .

		u Life and Letters of
Charles Bui	PERSON	- finch '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will appeal to a larger circle than might care for the record of older
Boston	LOCATION	or the life of one of our first architects .


Charles Bulfinch	PERSON	was a man of broad culture .

		He came of a family well-known in the
Boston	LOCATION	of the eighteenth century , in which was kept up a relation with
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , both by study in earlier years and by later travel , that brought their interests more into the cur - rent of the world 's ideas than was commonly the case in the
America	LOCATION	of a hundred years ago .

		His grand - father and his father had been doctors , one study - ing his profession in
Paris	LOCATION	, the other in
London	LOCATION	and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		Although not destined for the family profession ,
Charles Bulfinch	PERSON	spent several years of 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, his youth in continental study , with results advan - tageous not merely to himself but to the country as well .

		Subsequent events rather forced upon him as a profession what had been more of a cultivated taste , and he became the first American architect of real distinction .

		The nation at large knows his work in the west front of the Capitol at
Washington	LOCATION	and in the
State House	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	, while a smaller con - stituency owe to him
University Hall	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	and the
Massachusetts General Hospital	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this life of a man who , becoming imbued with old-world culture , if in one direction only , returned to his own country and gave himself up to doing what he could to increase her power and breadth of civilization , we of a later day have a peculiar interest .

		We should be glad to call especial attention to the many agreeable nooks and by-paths , as one may say , in the main road ; but these the reader must discover for himself .

		The book is pleasantly written by Miss
Ellen Bulfinch	PERSON	, with many letters , and is presented in delightful form by the publishers .

		The cante-fable of `` Aucassin et Nic - olete '' has become of late years some - what widely known to English read - ers , thanks mainly to the delightful version made by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		That old French romance contains many other gems of purest ray serene , hardly inferior in beauty to that tale of Provencal love , is a fact by no means so well known .

		A lit - tle volume called '' Nouvelles Franchises en Prose du Xlllme Siecle , '' published in
1856	DATE	, presented modern readers with the text of five romances , of which '' Aucassin et Nicolete '' was the last .

		The other four have been left for the late
William Mor	PERSON	- ris to translate , and his versions have duly appeared as issues of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not long before his death , the translator consented to the re-publica - tion of these four translations in a volume of the ordinary sort , and asked Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	to intro - duce them to their new and wider public .

		This vol - ume of '' Old French Romances '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is a treasure indeed .

		The English is as archaic as one could wish , and the spirit of the mediaeval French most subtly decanted into new vessels .

		The events of these stories happen , as the editor happily suggests , '' at the root of the moun - tains , on the glittering plain , and in short , we get news from Nowhere . ''

		And for this gift , as for so many others of perfect beauty , we may now thank only the memory of the noble poet whose special mission it was to interpret to a self-conscious age the life and thought of an unsophisticated past .

		It is encouraging to read so interest - ing a book upon a subject usually so dry as '' Proportional Representa - tion '' ; and Professor
J. R. Commons	PERSON	, while in some sense an advocate , has done much in his essay upon the subject to disabuse the mind of misconceptions , and to present a clear , cogent , and impartial con - sideration of a greatly misunderstood movement .

		He contends that while proportional representation recognizes the existence of parties as indispensable in a free government , it prohibits the exaggerated influence of small factions holding the balance of power between two parties , and thus removes the incentives to bribery in elections .

		He thinks also that proportional representation based upon political opinions , rather than territorial areas , is a '' spe - cific '' for the gerrymander .

		By abolishing districts , the substance of the gerrymander is effectually oblit - erated .

		Parties are represented in proportion to their strength .

		Justice and equality become reali - ties .

		The independence of the voter , and freedom from the rule of the party machine , are assured . ''

		Freedom from the rule of the machine , '' he says , '' is , first , power on the part of the voters to control the nominations of their party ; and second , power to defeat obnoxious candidates without endangering the success of the party . ''

		His arguments are sus - tained with tables , maps , and diagrams , illustrating and explaining them .

		Proportional representation is not an untried experiment .

		It has been success - fully tried and is at present in vogue in several of the cantons of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and there is no thought of change there .

		It is now proposed as a method of reform in American politics .

		Professor Com - mons believes it is only preliminary to social reform .

		The book is a valuable addition to the '' Library of Economics and Politics '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A glance at Japanese literature .

		One of the distinctive characteristics of this century of English letters is its relation to the literature of for - eign countries .

		In the beginning of the century ,
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	began to familiarize us with German literature .

		In the middle of the century , attention being already centrifugal , Tourgue ` nieff and
Tolstoi	PERSON	concentrated interest upon the literature of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Nowadays we can hardly say that there is any particular foreign influence ;
Norway	LOCATION	and Bel - gium and
Spain	LOCATION	attract to themselves , by this touch of novelty , an already half - jaded curiosity ; but no single nation exerts the power over the republic of letters that was exerted by
France	LOCATION	two hundred years ago , or by
Germany	LOCATION	more recently .

		It is pos - sible that a new interest will arise , not only in En - gland but in all cultivated
Europe	LOCATION	, for the literature of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		We have already been strongly influenced by her more material arts and craft , but we do not know much of Japanese literature .

		With a view of affording some acquaintance therewith ,
Roger Rior	PERSON	- dan and
Tozo Takayanagi	PERSON	have given us '' Sunrise Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is called '' A Glance at the Literature of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and that is just about what it is .

		After we have read it we feel that we have glanced at the matter , and no more .

		It is neither a serious history of the development of Jap - anese literature , nor a free rendering of its spirit .

		We rather regret that the book should neither charm and delight us nor give us material for information
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 which we may desire .

		It is attractively printed , and there is a good deal that is interesting besides ; but it still leaves a place for an Introduction to Japanese literature that shall be either fascinating or scholarly , or both .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Briefs for Debate '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , edited by Messrs.
W. Du Bois Brookings	PERSON	and
Ralph Curtis Ringwalt	PERSON	, is a book that will be found useful by members of literary societies , and will also prove a helpful adjunct to the work of the teacher of rhetoric .

		The subjects selected deal with '' current political , economic , and social topics . ''

		A great number of such topics are analyzed , and sup - plied with outline arguments and bibliographical refer - ences .

		Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	provides the work with an excellent introduction .

		Madame de La Fayette 's '' La Princesse de Cleves '' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- is edited for school use by Messrs.
B. F. Sledd	PERSON	and
H. Gorrell	PERSON	, and is a welcome addition to our list of annotated texts .

		`` Moi , '' a three-act comedy by La - biche and
Martin	PERSON	-LRB-
Allyn	PERSON	-RRB- , is edited by Mr.
B. W. Wells	PERSON	for what is styled the `` Ca Ira '' series .

		Other books for the teacher of French are '' Premieres Lectures '' -LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- , by '' Veteran '' ; `` French Lessons and Exer - cises '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
C. H. Grandgent	PERSON	; and a book in two parts on '' The Study and Practice of French in School , '' by Mile .


Louise C. Boname	PERSON	, who is her own publisher .

		Professor
O. F. Emerson	PERSON	's '' Brief History of the En - glish Language '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is marked by the same excellences as his longer work on the same subject , pub - lished less than two years ago ; the differences being principally in the way of condensation and re-arrange - ment in the later work , to adapt it to the use of schools .

		One of the noticeable features of the book is the stress laid upon spoken language as a factor in shaping En - glish past and present ; and this , in the hands of an enthusiastic and skilful teacher , may be made the means of original work on the part of students .

		Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's new six - volume edition of `` John - son 's Lives of the Poets '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , of which four volumes have already been issued , presents the work in a very satisfactory form .


Cunningham	PERSON	's edition , hitherto the library standard , has become out - dated by the mass of new information that has accum - ulated during the past forty years , and his text is by no means accurate .

		Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	gives us a new apparatus of notes , concisely stated and sparingly introduced , while his text is literally '' that of the last edition to pass un - der
Johnson	PERSON	's revision , the edition of
1783	DATE	; the phras - ing , punctuation , and spelling have been alike faithfully preserved . ''

		The edition is made particularly attractive by portraits of all the poets discussed by
Johnson	PERSON	.

		The pretty edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Omar , '' pub - lished by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, gives us the text of the '' Rubaiyat '' as posthumously corrected by Mr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	, also the text of the first edition , and the variants offered by the others .

		It also contains a biography by Mr.
Michael Kerney	PERSON	, the epilogue to
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Teiresias , '' the translator 's own introduc - tion and notes , and , in addition to all these features , reprints the translation of
Jami	PERSON	's ''
Salaman	PERSON	and Absal . ''

		A portrait also appears , and the book contains , alto - gether , a good dollar 's worth of literature .

		IjITERARY NOTES .

		It is announced that Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	will write the biography of
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Balzac 's '' The Country Parson '' -LRB- '' Le Cur <
$ de Vil	MONEY	- lage '' -RRB- , translated by Miss
Ellen Marriage	PERSON	, has just been published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	is now publishing a vol - ume of '' Collected Essays . ''

		We trust that we may not have to wait long for an American edition . ''


Germany	LOCATION	'' and '' The Sea '' are the respective sub - jects of two new volumes in the series of '' Stories by English Authors , '' of which Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers .

		The '' Athenaeum '' states that Mr.
Aubrey de Vere	PERSON	is about to publish his autobiography , containing reminis - cences of the various men of literary eminence with whom he has been associated during the last fifty years .

		Four new volumes have been published in the taste - ful new edition of Marryatt issued by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The titles are ''
Percival Keene	PERSON	, '' '' Mas - termau Ready , '' '' The Privateersman , '' and '' Monsieur Violet . ''

		The Minister 's Wooing , '' '' The Pearl of
Orr	PERSON	's Is - land , '' and ''
Agnes of Sorrento	PERSON	, '' are the first volumes , just published , of the new uniform edition of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's writings .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		A new series of works to be known as '' The Sports - man 's Library , '' will be published by Mr.
Edward	PERSON	Ar - nold ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The volumes will be issued at the rate of two or three a year , under the editorship of Sir
Herbert Maxwell	PERSON	, and will be profusely illustrated .

		The series called '' Heroes of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , has hitherto consisted entirely of new books .

		The latest volume offers a de - parture from this custom , being nothing more than a new edition of Irving 's ''
Columbus	LOCATION	'' in its shorter form . ''

		Bibliographica , '' the beautiful quarterly publication devoted to the history and art of books , has reached its tenth issue , leaving but two more to complete the series .

		We feel that we are conferring a favor on book lovers and collectors in advising them to send to Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , the American agents , for pros - pectuses of this really monumental work .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published , at a moderate price , a neat and compact edition of
Bour	PERSON	- rienne 's '' Memoirs of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	. ''

		Four vol - umes are bound in two , and numerous illustrations are supplied .

		The same publishers also send us an excep - tionally attractive edition of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Leatherstock	PERSON	- ing '' novels , in five volumes , handsomely illustrated .

		The second volume of '' The Tragedies of Euripides in English Verse , '' translated by Mr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	, has just been published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A third vol - ume will complete the work .

		The instalment now pub - lished includes a considerable essay on '' Euripides and His Work , '' and translations of the following six plays : `` Andromache , '' `` The Children of Herakles , '' `` The Daughters of Troy , '' '' Electra , '' ''
Helen	PERSON	, '' and '' The Madness of Herakles . ''

		The
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	is raising a fund for the purpose of placing a bronze bust of the late Dr.
William F. Poole	PERSON	in the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	or the New - berry Library ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	will welcome contributions from any one of the multitudes who have 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, found ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index '' of great use to them and would like to honor its maker .

		No one has done more than Dr.
Poole	PERSON	to promote the cause of general culture through public libraries .

		The committee , of which Dr.
G. E. Wire	PERSON	,
1574	DATE
Judson Ave.	ORGANIZATION	,
Evanston	LOCATION	, 111. , is secre - tary and treasurer , will welcome all contributions , how - ever small .

		Wiilker 's '' Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur '' is the initial number of an important series of illustrated histories of literatures , soon to be published by
Das Biobliographische Institut	ORGANIZATION	in
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Each history will be prepared by men of authority in their own line : the one on German literature by Professors
Friedrich Vogt	PERSON	and
Max Koch	PERSON	of
Breslau	LOCATION	; on the French , by Profes - sors
Hermann Suchier	PERSON	of
Halle	PERSON	and
Heinrich Morf	PERSON	of
Zurich	LOCATION	; the Italian , by
Lector Berthold Wiese	PERSON	of
Halle	PERSON	and
Privatdocent Erasmo Percopo	PERSON	of
Naples	LOCATION	.

		Some - what later the series will include histories of the litera - tures of the Slavonic and Oriental nations .

		The pub - lishers intend to avoid the publication of '' picture - books , '' and will make the illustrations contribute in every possible way to the clearer presentation of the subject .

		In selecting material for illustrations , three general principles are to be followed : they must not be too numerous , they must be selected by specialists and be arranged on scientific principles , and they must be reproduced from authentic originals and in the very best artistic skill .

		The first Lieferung of the work on English literature has just appeared , and gives a fair sample of what may be expected from the rest of the series .

		Professor
Wiilker	PERSON	's name is ample guarantee that the book is trustworthy and fully abreast of the latest scientific research , and the illustrations seem to have been selected and reproduced according to the principles just mentioned .

		One of these is a facsimile of a page from the Anglo-Saxon Durhambuch ; another is a full-page wood-cut of
Tennyson	LOCATION	; others are of the earliest monuments of civilization in
England	LOCATION	.

		With them is given exact information as to the history of the originals and their present location .

		In the whole book of fourteen lieferungen there will be one hundred and fifty illustrations in the text , twenty-five large ones in colors or from copper or wood , and eleven facsimile inserts ; and among them all will be a large number of authentic portraits .

		The treatment of Ossian is quite characteristic , and shows the general method of the book .

		After briefly describing
Ossian	PERSON	and the
Sagen	PERSON	- kreis upon which his poems are based , the discussion shows how
Macpherson	PERSON	in the eighteenth century won renown by sending these poems all over the world to influence more or less the literatures of other peoples .

		Then follows an abstract of many of the poems , with frequent quotations in modern German translation .

		The complete book is to be sold at
fourteen marks	MONEY	.

		ON RETURNING A BORROWED BOOK . ''

		Such is the fate of borrowed Books ; they 're lost , Or not the Book returneth , but its Ghost . ''


Charles Nodier	PERSON	.

		This book you loaned , I did not borrow ; Else had you wisdom at great cost , And learned the truth made Nodier sorrow : A borrowed book returns a ghost .

		I 've read the tale of these two lovers ; My memory 's stolen all ' t will hold , And yet you 11 find between the covers The same sweet story as of old .

THE History of Modern Painting	ORGANIZATION	.

		By

		Imperial 8vo .

		2304 pages .

		With over thirteen hundred Illustrations .

		In three Vols .

		Price per set , cloth ,
$ 20.00	MONEY	.

		It would be difficult , if not impossible , to convey in a few sentences an adequate impression of the richness of the data brought together in these two thousand pages .

		No such com - plete history of Modern Art has ever before been attempted .

		The story opens with the English Art of the eighteenth century , and treats at length of the English painters and illus - trators of the nineteenth century , of the schools prior to
1840	DATE	, of the artists in water-color , of the plein-air school of Con - stable , and of the realists , omitting neither the New Pre - Kaphaelites ,
Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Morris	ORGANIZATION	,
Walter Crane	PERSON	and
Watts	PERSON	, nor
James M'Neill Whistler	PERSON	, and `` The Boys of
Glasgow	LOCATION	. ''


France	LOCATION	receives a large share of the author 's space ; and from
France	LOCATION	we are led to
America	LOCATION	and American painters living abroad ; to
Germany	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, Nor - way ,
Sweden	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	; whilst the influence of
Japan	LOCATION	on the development of European art is not overlooked .

		Yet , however fascinating the letterpress of such a work may be , a history of painting without illustrations would fail to convey a sufficient conception of the subject .

		In Dr.
Muther	PERSON	's work there is an average of two illustrations comprising por - traits of many of the artists , and reproductions of their most important pictures or drawings to three pages of the text .

		Thus the HISTORY OF MODERN PAINTING appeals to all lovers of art who possess pictures or would fain possess them , to all who crowd exhibitions and picture galleries , and indeed to everyone who is interested in art and history .

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's new volume is one of special importance , in that it represents in an admirable and conclusive manner not only the verse of the soldier 's life , but also the poetry of pa - triotism , of adventure , and of the sea , and of a modern field , to be termed roughly the romance of applied science , which the author has made his own .

		In this new book the qualities which have distinguished Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's best expression in verse are shown in a riper and fuller development than before , and for this reason , and also on account of his range of themes , it seems proper to invite special attention to `` The Seven Seas . ''

Great Comstock Lode	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the pros - pector , through development and deep-mining , to the last of the stock gambling , the story is told in a way that presents a singularly vivid and engrossing picture of a life which has played so large a part in the development of the remoter West .

		263 THE WORLD 'S MEMORY . ''

		The world 's memory must be kept alive , or we shall never see an end of its old mistakes .

		We are in danger to lose our identity and be - come infantile in every generation .

		That is the real menace under which we cower every - where in this age of change . ''

		These words , pregnant with vital meaning , and deep in their import to our civilization , were spoken the other day at
Princeton	LOCATION	by Professor
Woodrow Wil	PERSON	- son , the orator of the Sesquicentennial Cele - bration .

		Nor were they an incidental feature of the eloquent and masterly oration in which they occurred ; they were rather of its very texture , and embodied the quintessence of its thought .

		Political philosophers who have espoused the cause of modern democracy , and who have , with alternating hopes and fears , watched its triumphant onward march , who have thrilled with its beginnings among sturdy Helvetians and determined Netherlanders , who have studied it as a peaceful development in
England	LOCATION	and as a volcanic outburst in
France	LOCATION	, who have seen it wrest constitution after con - stitution from European monarchs , and who have witnessed its subjugation of the great New World , have always been insistent upon its dangers , and particularly upon the danger of its tendency , everywhere manifest , to disre - gard the teachings of history , and to reject the experience of the past merely because it is the past as a guide to the future .

		It was , then , peculiarly fitting that a note of warning upon this subject should have been made the keynote of Professor
Wilson	PERSON	's address , pre - pared , as that address was , to commemorate the sesquicentennial anniversary of a famous insti - tution of learning , and to emphasize the func - tion to be performed for our civilization by all such institutions , if they are to prove them - selves worthy of their trust .

		No society can safely break with the past save by a gradual process that is content to sift the teachings of experience , and reject only what has proved itself prejudicial to human progress .

		Those who do not sympathize with the past , and would have us once for all freed from its trammels , are precisely those who do not understand the past , and are persuaded that the essentials of social organization , like 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, its trappings , are matters of fashion , varying from age to age .

		But the student of history who has seen beneath externals , and who has caught anything of the spirit of the human epic , knows that it is foolish to judge institu - tions and beliefs and social ideals by absolute standards , knows that all these things are pro- ducts of an evolutionary process whereby every people in every century has been fitted with what it has most needed in its own particular stage of culture .

		That for our own uses we reject such devices as monarchy and
Moham	PERSON	- medanism and the mediaeval guilds , does not justify us in assuming that they have worked harm in their own time and place .

		Rather do we see in the fact of their existence and long - continued potency their ample justification .

		And if we find our own national inheritance to include certain elements that to the clear - sighted among us seem irrational , impeding the steps of progress , we should take long and prayerful counsel before seeking to sweep them away , restraining our impatience by the reflec - tion that whatever is deeply-rooted in the expe - rience of past generations must have subserved some useful purpose , and that the possibilities of its usefulness may not yet be exhausted .

		The universities clearly have no task more important than that of drawing our attention to the past , and of encouraging us in a sympathetic understanding and comprehension of the past .

		Professor
Wilson	PERSON	stated one of the deepest of truths when he spoke in the following language : '' Unschooled men have only their habits to remind them of the past , only their desires and their instinctive judgments of what is to guide them into the future ; the college should serve the state as its organ of recollec - tion , its seat of vital memory .

		It should give the coun - try men who know the probabilities of failure and success , who can separate the tendencies which are per - manent from the tendencies which are of the moment merely , who can distinguish promises from threats , knowing the life men have lived , the hopes they have tested , and the principles they have proved . ''

		In the same spirit of wise patriotism , the Presi - dent of the
United States	LOCATION	, on the following day , added the testimony of the statesman to that of the scholar . ''

		In a nation like ours , charged with the care of nu - merous and widely varied interests , a spirit of conserv - atism and toleration is absolutely essential .

		A collegiate training , the study of principles unvexed by distracting and misleading influences , and a correct apprehension of the theories upon which our republic is established , ought to constitute the college graduate a constant mon - itor , warning against popular rashness and excess . ''

		How greatly we need as a nation to take to heart such doctrine is this , is only too clearly proved by the political record of the past quarter-century . ''

		Popular rashness and ex - cess '' have been visible everywhere in the coun - sels of our leaders and the acts of our public officers .

		In our legislation upon some of the most important subjects of public concern we have run the whole gamut of folly , delusion , and fatuous ignorance of the operations of nat - ural law .

		We have set at defiance the best - established principles of political and economic thought , and have learned our lesson so ill that no sooner have we recovered in part from one disaster than we have rushed blindly upon an - other .

		Instead of keeping alive the world 's memory , we do not succeed in keeping alive our memory as individuals .

		The shallowness and ignorance , if not the criminal culpability , of some political leader may be to-day so ex - posed as to put him clearly to shame in the eyes of the world ; yet
five years later	DATE	we may find him again a man of position and influence , trusted by those whom he has betrayed , his sup - port sought after by thousands who have either forgotten his past , or are guileless enough to believe that the leopard can change his spots .

		If we are to look anywhere for the healing of our diseased memory , whether individual or national , it must surely be to those institutions in which the truth , undimmed by prejudice or passion , the truth of yesterday as well as of to-day , is sought after by earnest stu - dents , under the guidance of men who have devoted their lives to seeking out the causes of things .

		Such a home for seekers after truth , such an altar for keeping '' the world 's memory '' aglow , is pictured in the closing passage of Professor
Wilson	PERSON	's oration , a passage so noble and so beautiful that it must not suffer the violence of dismemberment . ''

		I have had sight of the perfect place of learning in my thought ; a free place , and a various , where no man could be and not know with how great a destiny knowl - edge had come into the world itself a little world ; but not perplexed , living with a singleness of aim not known without ; the home of sagacious men , hard-headed , and with a will to know , debaters of the world 's questions every day and used to the rough ways of democracy ; and yet a place removed calm Science seated there , recluse , ascetic , like a nun , not knowing that the world passes , not caring if the truth but come in answer to her prayer ; and Literature , walking within her open doors in quiet chambers with men of olden time , storied walls about her and calm voices infinitely sweet ; here ' magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn , ' to which you may withdraw and use your youth for pleasure ; there windows open straight upon the street where many stand and talk intent upon the world of men and business .

		A place where ideals are kept in heart in an air they can breathe , but no fools ' paradise .

		A place where to hear the truth about the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 past and hold debate upon the affairs of the present , with knowledge and without passion ; like the world in having all men 's life at heart , a place for men and all that concerns them ; but unlike the world in its self - possession , its thorough way of talk , its care to know more than the moment brings to light ; slow to take ex - citement , its air pure and wholesome with a breath of faith ; every eye within it bright in the clear day and quick to look towards heaven for the confirmation of its hope . ''

		We may fitly supplement this passage , and at the same time bring these observations to a close , by an extract from Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's Princeton ode , an effort no less worthy of the occasion than was Professor
Wilson	PERSON	's address : '' God made the light , and all the light is good .

		There is no war between the old and new ; The conflict lies between the false and true .

		The stars , that high in heaven their courses run , In glory differ , but their light is one .

		The beacons , gleaming o'er the sea of life , Are rivals but in radiance , not in strife . ''

		IS THERE AN AMERICAN LITERATURE ?

		At the present time there is in our public schools and colleges an unmistakable movement toward the systematic study of the American writers .

		This movement is not confined , however , to the schools .

		With the passing of that most remarkable group of writers of whom
Irving	LOCATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Haw	PERSON	- thorne ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and Motley were the central figures , there has come an unpre - cedented interest in the lives and works of these men .

		No one can have failed to notice how numer - ous of late have become the works dealing with these authors and their writings .

		Biographies of American men of letters have been , during the past decade , among the most successful of American books .

		Since
1878	DATE	, when Professor
Richardson	PERSON	published his '' Primer of American Literature , '' no less than twenty volumes , some of them by such eminent and scholarly critics as
Underwood	LOCATION	, Sted - man ,
Tyler	PERSON	, and Beers , have dealt with the history of our prose and verse .

		The text-book dealing exclusively with American literary development has but recently appeared , and although it is one of the very latest novelties among educational apparatus , it has found a permanent and important place in the schools .

		A short appendix to the English Lit - erature no longer satisfies our teachers , and the demand for a separate book has become so fully recognized that within the past year no less than seven text-books on this subject have been either published or announced by leading houses .

		The movement has spread even into the primary and intermediate school grades , where the old readers have been replaced almost wholly by entire Amer - ican classics published for the purpose in conven - iently handled and inexpensive editions .

		All this points to the fact that in the opinion of very many thoughtful men the time has come to study Amer - ican literature , apart from the English product , as if it were a distinct entity .

		This increasing interest in native writings has again brought into prominence an old question , one that has been discussed at intervals ever since Channing opened the debate in
1823	DATE	: Have we an independent American Literature ?

		Every volume thus far published upon our native literary products , including works by such authorities as
Whipple	LOCATION	,
Underwood	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Tyler	PERSON	,
Richardson	PERSON	,
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	,
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, and
Eugene Law	PERSON	- rence , and even foreign critics like Professor
Nichol	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	, Professor
Scherr	PERSON	of
Germany	LOCATION	, and others , has borne the title '' American Literature , '' and has dealt upon the evolution of the literature , its feeble beginnings , its infancy and youth , its first traces of individuality , its gradual attainment of strength and its full maturity , thus in a way ac - knowledging it as a distinct growth .

		It was as a protest against one of the more recent of these books that the Professor of English Litera - ture in one of our leading universities remarked not long since , '' I wish we might find some writer and publisher with the courage to entitle such a book ' A History of English Literature in
America	LOCATION	, ' the only expression for the thing which is not abso - lutely false and misleading . ''

		A leading American review but yesterday , speaking of '' what is called American literature , '' gave forth this dictum : '' Properly speaking there is no such thing , unless the pictorial scratchings of aborigines on stones and birch bark are to be classed as literary productions .

		Every piece of literary work done in the English language by a man or woman born to the use of it is a part of that noble whole which we call English literature , whether the author lives in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the
United States of America	LOCATION	, the Dominion of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zea	LOCATION	- land , or
South Africa	LOCATION	... Just so long as writers in the
United States	LOCATION	continue to express themselves in the language of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, so long will their works belong to the same magnificent literature . ''

		It can not but be admitted that these champions of '' English literature in
America	LOCATION	'' have some very good grounds upon which to base their arguments .

		The history of literary
Europe	LOCATION	does not furnish a single precedent against them .

		In every case the language in which a literary production is written determines at once its place .

		An ode in the Greek language is now regarded as a part of Greek litera - ture , whether written by an Athenian beneath the Acropolis or by an alien in
Syracuse	LOCATION	or
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		Roman literature , excepting perhaps such works as Bacon 's '' Novum Organum , '' comprises all writings in
Latin	LOCATION	, whether they were made by the Tiber , the Thames , or the
Euphrates	LOCATION	.

		Two thousand years from now will not all writings in the English lan - guage be regarded as English literature , no matter what the geographical place of their production ?

		Again , it must be remembered that a perfect litera - ture is an evolution .

		Beginning with the rude war - 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, songs of a savage tribe , its growth is constantly up - wards through every stage of that people 's progress toward civilization , until at length it reaches its flower of perfection .

		It stands complete as the his - tory of a nation 's intellectual and spiritual life .

		It has been affected by a thousand elements , race peculiarities , physical and spiritual environments , contact with neighboring tribes , great moral and civil crises , peculiar personalities .

		It is the essence of ten thousand lives ; it is the nation itself far more than are the few thousands of breathing beings who make up its census .

		In the light of these argu - ments , then , how can there be an independent lit - erature in
America	LOCATION	, a region settled by highly cul - tured Englishmen less than three centuries ago , a region using the English language in its purity and having institutions which fundamentally are true to those of the mother land ?

		There is no one , I think , who will not admit that the case of two independent literatures written in the same language is a wholly unprecedented one ; but it is no argument that because a thing is unpre - cedented it is therefore impossible .

		The discovery of
America	LOCATION	was an unprecedented event .

		It was a most marvellous and world-revolutionizing event .

		There are men , even among those whose ancestors for generations have been natives of the new soil , who have not ceased to wonder about it , who insist upon measuring it only by old world standards , on treating it as if it were merely a vast addition to the area of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		America in the first centuries after its discovery was almost literally a new world .

		Man never went to live in an environment more strange to him .

		Every element save that of race tended to separate the minds of the settlers from those of their kindred in the motherland .

		There was something in the air of the new continent , in its vastness and freedom , in its unlimited wealth and unprecedented opportunities , that tended to put a new spirit into its sons , to breed a new race with a new outlook and new ideals .

		Three hundred years of this environ - ment have produced a peculiar people , with a dis - tinct and strongly marked individuality , living under an unprecedented form of government .

		The element of epoch has had its share in the problem .

		The past century has been an unprece - dented one , and nowhere more so than in
America	LOCATION	.

		It has been a century of quick growths , of broad and enduring foundations laid with unheard-of rapidity .

		It would have been madness a century ago to have prophesied even a fraction of the won - ders which were to take place on our soil .

		The history of the development of
Western America	LOCATION	reads like a page from `` The Arabian Nights . ''

		What an era of bustle and stir !

		Where else in all history can you find similar conditions ?

		When have men been thrown more fully upon their own re - sources ?

		The Revolution , that furnace that tried the metal of our character to its utmost limit , was our heroic period .

		The mad struggle in the forests of a new world was at length over ; the colonists found themselves face to face with a bewildering and undreamed-of situation .

		Then came the recon - struction period , which called for almost superhuman wisdom .

		The early years of the new government , with their test cases , their doubt and uncertainty ; the opening of the vast areas beyond the Alle - ghanies , with their almost interminable forests and prairies , with their swarming fauna and strange flora .

		The new Colonial era that turned as if by magic these wilds into a garden the granary of the world ; the great wave of foreign immigration that poured upon us with increasing force ; the thousands of unforeseen problems attendant upon rapidly expanding territory and growing popula - tion ; the gold fever of
' 49	DATE	, with its headlong exo - dus over the plains and across the Rockies ; the world-revolutionizing inventions of the cotton gin and the steamboat ; the rapid spread of railways ; the conflict with slavery , which at length burst into one of the most disastrous civil wars of modern times , all this was crowded into one century .

		They were unprecedented conditions , and they have left deep marks in our national character .

		We have been called upon to solve physical and mental and moral problems on a vast scale ; we have started movements that have become world-wide ; we have developed an American spirit that makes us vastly different from any other people .

		This spirit has been as distinctly an evolution as has been the En - glish spirit .

		It has grown with great rapidity , but the growth has been a natural and a healthy one .

		It has passed through every stage of development .

		Has not
Chicago	LOCATION	, for example , passed through every stage of a city 's life , and has it not to-day as dis - tinct a personality and as substantial a promise for the future as has
Paris	LOCATION	or
London	LOCATION	?

		Yet
Chicago	LOCATION	sixty years ago was a marsh on the remote frontier .

		Americans are recognized at sight the world over .

		To speak of a Yankee as an Englishman in
America	LOCATION	would be to invite ridicule .

		He is redolent of the American soil ; Americanism the spirit of the new world breathes from every pore .

		Let him in the person of a
Whittier	LOCATION	write a '' Snow Bound , '' or in the person of a Lowell write '' The
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' can these in fairness be called British literature ?

		That the American literature is written in the English language is , in the minds of many , an insu - perable argument against its independence .

		But this in reality is the least of all the arguments .

		Lit - erature springs from the soul ; it is the embodiment of hopes and fears , of moods gay or melancholy , of experience , of sensation , of conjecture , and the lan - guage is only the lifeless medium of communication .

		Do Homer into any language , and he is still Greek .

		No translation can take the French out of Hugo or the Russian out of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	.

		It has been safe to define a literature as all the writings in a given lan - guage .

		So firmly fixed is this idea that a recent critic of
Roger Bacon	PERSON	, who wrote in the
thirteenth century	DATE	, declares that `` his writings , being all in
Latin	LOCATION	, do not belong to English literature . ''

		To what literature , then , do they belong ?

		This habit of classifying literature according to the medium
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 through which it has passed has come from the fact that in the history of the old world there have heen no two nations with distinct governments and per - sonalities using the same language .

		It remained for the new world to break this precedent .

		There was a time when a few tribes from the shores of the
North Sea	LOCATION	could cross a narrow chan - nel to a small island and there become a distinct nation .

		There was no radical change of environ - ment ; they did not change their fundamental views of life and their great fundamental institutions .

		But this change of habitat took place during a barbaric age , one that repelled friendly contact with neighbors .

		They drifted , like all provincial peoples , away from their original tongue , until it in time became a dialect and finally a language .

		The settlers of
America	LOCATION	did not cross a mere channel , but a then almost inconceivable expanse of ocean ; and had the schism taken place in earlier times , their language , even after three centuries , would have become a dialect almost unintelligible in its native land .

		But the civilization of the present day , with its thousand points of contact and its constant interchange of books and ideas , does not allow pro- vincial growths .

		The confusion of tongues is a phe - nomenon of barbarous ages .

		There will be few new languages in the future .

		The civilization of the past three centuries has been drawing the na - tions together , making them into a vast neighbor - hood , until even the idea of a universal language has been gravely discussed .

		It was impossible for the Americans to grow into a new language , even though they changed their form of government , their spirit , their outlook on life ; it was equally impossible for the Saxons , even though they changed but little their environment and institutions , to avoid the growth of a new tongue .

		Can we never achieve our literary independence ?

		Must we go down through the ages forever tied intel - lectually to the apron-strings of our mother ?

		The idea is absurd .

		It is certain , unless civilization be obscured by other Dark Ages , that we shall never drift away from
England	LOCATION	in our language , but we are constantly drifting from her in everything else .

		We are doing our own thinking , solving our own problems in our own way , and we have been doing so for a century .

		It was in
1820	DATE	that
Sidney Smith	PERSON	demanded of a British public , `` Who reads an American book ? ''

		In the mean time we have pro- duced an
Emerson	LOCATION	, a Foe , a
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	, a
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, a
Whittier	LOCATION	, a
Lowell	LOCATION	, a Whitman , there is no end to the list .

		The writings of these men have been no feeble imitation of European models .

		They have been strong and intensely original ; they have over - flowed with the spirit of a new world ; they have been colored by its soil and permeated with Amer - icanism , until to attempt to remove this native ele - ment would be to destroy the fabric .

		Men like
Cooper	PERSON	and Whitman and
Mark Twain	PERSON	would have been impossible on any other soil .

		Then for more than a century we have been mak - ing our national songs .

		There are hundreds of lyrics that have burst hot from the American heart , and that profoundly thrill every American , which yet mean nothing to an Englishman save as he trans - lates into them his own emotions of fatherland .

		Are these hymns not our own ?

		Is it not foolishness to speak of such songs as the '' Concord Hymn , '' '' The Star Spangled Banner , '' `` My Country 't is of Thee , '' and '' The Battle Hymn of the Republic '' as En - glish songs in
America	LOCATION	?

		Did we not evolve them from as profound and tragic an experience as did England her '' Rule Britannia '' ?

		It seems to me that it may be laid down almost as an axiom that when a distinct nation has acquired a distinct personality and has produced writers and writings sui generis , reflecting the soil , the spirit , the individuality of that people , then that nation has a distinct literature , no matter what may be the language in which it is written .

		American literature is proud of its origin .

		It passed its infancy and childhood in the land of Chaucer .

		The first chap - ters of its life-history are the same as those in the history of English literature .

		But in its early man - hood it migrated to a new world .

		Its character was evolved during centuries amid unprecedented sur - roundings .

		It stands to-day united to
England	LOCATION	by only one of the four great elements that determine the character of a literature that of race ; and even this tie is a weak one , since the average Amer - ican citizen can boast but a small fraction of En - glish blood .

		But following this argument , it is asked , Why not a Mexican , a Brazilian , a Peruvian literature ?

		Why not , indeed ?

		It is a mere matter of time .

		There may sometime be twenty literatures in the Spanish language .

		The poet of the
Amazon	LOCATION	and the
Orinoco	LOCATION	, the singer of sweet songs of the Cor - dilleras and the Pampas , the martial lyrist who fires the patriotism of the Andean republics , are they making Spanish literature ?

		It is inevitable that the people of the American republics shall grow constantly away from their European parents , in spirit , in individuality , in everything .

		The new soil , the new skies , the new environment , the new epoch with its new problems , all can have but one result .

		The time must come when the line is to be drawn between literatures of the old and the new .

		It is a mere matter of when .

		But with the
United States of America	ORGANIZATION	there should be now no question .

		A WORLD - ANTHOLOGY OF POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On reading Mr.
F. L. Thompson	PERSON	's communication on a proposed `` World - Anthology of Lyric Poetry , '' in your last issue , I must at least express my hearty wish to see the work speedily undertaken on some of the lines laid down .

		The value to the student of the comparative method of literary study can hardly be overestimated , and this method , as I understand , is the basis of Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's suggestion .

		There will be great difficulty , 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	of course , in making the work proposed a worthy com - panion of Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	's in point of taste , for in all these years , and with all our anthologies , we have had only one Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	.

		I do not know of any foreign anthologists of his calibre ; yet if such exist we shall still want a coordinating Palgrave to put the whole together .

		Perhaps , however , we shall do wrong if we demand ab - solute genius in the matter .

		Honest talents and sure scholarship ought , it would seem , to give us a working basis and to ensure us a volume or volumes that would fairly serve the purposes Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	has in view .

		How to procure the needed cooperation will , of course , be the most difficult question confronting us ; and per - haps the most practical solution at present might be the endeavor to get the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	to have their French and German anthologies in the '' Golden Treas - ury '' series revised , and to add to them similar volumes covering the other great literatures .

		After such a series of volumes had run the gauntlet of criticism and been subjected to revision , the work of coordination might be begun ; and whether it were successful or not , we should at least have a number of anthologies that would be very helpful to the student of poetry .

		With regard now to the lines on which the final work should be conducted , I must confess that I should not envy the editor 's task , unless he stuck quite close to the normal categories , comparing sonnets with sonnets , odes with odes , elegies with elegies .

		An anthology based on such a conception of lyric poetry as Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	sug - gests , would be helpful also , but more I think to the general reader than to the student , who can never , in my opinion , long let go the idea oiform without serious loss to his work .

		This leads me to remark that unless Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	himself acts on his own interesting sug - gestion , or induces others to do so , in the near future , we shall in all probability find that some such work as he describes will grow naturally out of the study of the categories of poetry that is even now taking the place of the wider and less systematic study practised in the past .

		Critics are beginning to see that a study of the evolution of genres is forced upon us by the application of the scientific , comparative method to literature .

		Men are studying the ode as it has manifested itself in the different literatures , or the elegy , or the sonnet .

		Such students will sooner or later give us comparative anthol - ogies on narrower lines than those suggested by Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	, but I should think that a larger anthology would grow out of them .

		In conclusion , I must call attention to the fact that while the student as well as the general reader would be greatly aided by a World-Anthology , such a book could never relieve the conscientious critic from much of his present drudgery .

		The critic must know the bad as well as the good , before he can feel that he has fairly mastered the evolution of any category of literature .

		I think I speak advisedly in this matter , for I have been for some years investigating the evolution of the elegy , and I am sure that I have rarely failed to learn some - thing even from the most worthless specimens of it that I have examined .

		I will not say that my aesthetic sense was profited by the broadside epicedions or the academic elegiacs that I have passed over in the British Museum , but I will say that I have a far more correct knowledge of the evolution of the English elegy than I should have had if I had confined my attention to a study of the mas - terpieces like '' Lycidas '' and '' Adonai 's . ''

		The love - elegies of
Hammond	PERSON	are not interesting in themselves , but they are interesting in their relations with those of Tibullus and in connection with the contemporary latiniz - ing of English poetry in point of form .

		And this leads me to say that in addition to Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's anthology , we want a new edition of
Chalmers	ORGANIZATION	, if not a cheap corpus of English drama and poetry on an even greater scale than the notable
Autores Espanoles	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LYRICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		That is a stimulating idea put forth by Mr.
Thomp	PERSON	- son in your issue for
October 16	DATE	.

		A '' World - Anthology of Lyric Poetry , '' prepared adequately , would win the gratitude of all lovers of verse .

		Indeed , the comparative study of the particular forms of poetry or of the partic - ular divisions of literature belongs to those higher ranges of literary investigation sure to come in the future .

		Criticism of ways and means is inevitable .

		The ques - tion of selection makes trouble at once : I find myself very dubious about two at least of the authors in Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's list-by-way-of-suggestion .

		There is danger , too , in giving up the chronological arrangement , which is valuable in emphasizing organic development , and , on the side of language , has its advantages as well in indi - cating linguistic growth .

		Then for a practical consid - eration such a work would be very expensive , and pub - lishers would be shy of a volume which , because of its polyglot character , would appeal to the few .

		But that is no objection to the idea as such , which I should be only too happy to see carried out .

		Certainly the field is clear for such a work .

		THE UNITY OF LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The proposed '' World - Anthology of Lyric Poetry , '' outlined by a correspondent in your last issue , would be very interesting reading in itself , and as instructive as it would be interesting .

		I should welcome it for its own sake , and also as a testimony in favor of a truth we are ready academically to acknowledge , most of us , I fancy , although few of us are yet prepared to apply it unfailingly .

		This truth is that literature has a unity of its own ; that all literatures are really one in principle , however diverse their dialects may be ; that the drama , for example , despite its external modifications , is essen - tially the same throughout the ages , from Sophocles to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, from Menander to
Augier	PERSON	, from Plautus to Mr.
Harrigan	PERSON	; that the orator achieves to-day the same end as he aimed at two thousand years ago and under the same laws ; and that the lyric has flowered alike in the East and the West , in old
Greece	LOCATION	and in new
America	LOCATION	, whenever the heart of man was lifted up with joy or bowed down by sorrow .

		The proposed Anthology would be an object-lesson to all who have not yet grasped this underlying principle of comparative literature .

		LETTERS OF
VICTOR HUGO	PERSON	.

		* The first instalment of
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	's edition of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's Letters justifies the expectation that the work would prove one of the most important issues of the current pub - lishing season .

		Hugo is shown to have been a frank sometimes , as in his remarkable letters to Sainte-Beuve , an effusively frank corre - spondent ; and of this trait the world -LRB- always eagerly , and perhaps on the whole honorably and profitably , curious as to the essential and spiritual arcana of its great men -RRB- now receives the benefit .

		We do not mean to imply that in these opening letters , written in youth and in the golden prime of an active and ambitious manhood , the reader will find Hugo reflecting on the deeper questions of existence , or endeav - oring to frame some passably rational and con - solatory solution thereof .

		To the sound and well-digesting reasoning animal , such concerns and speculations come later in life , or when one , as the Germans expressively phrase it , sein Leben hinter sick hat ; and the letters before us cover the period during which the writer emphatically had life before him the period , that is to say , between

Paris	LOCATION	, and
1845	DATE	, when his earlier laurels as poet , dramatist , novelist , and Academician were still fresh upon him .

		The letters in this volume are arranged in five groups , according to their recipients ; and within each group the arrangement is chrono - logical .

		The first group consists of '' Letters to his Father and Mother '' mainly to the former ; the second , of letters `` To Adele Hugo -LSB- his wife -RSB- and Others '' ; the third , of letters '' To Various Persons , '' including De Vigny , the Abbe De Lamennais ,

		In an Appendix are thirteen let - ters to the Secretary of the Academic Des Jeux Floraux -LRB- 1819-1823 -RRB- ; together with seven `` Additional Letters '' to various persons .

		The following extracts from the letters , taken some - what at random , will serve better than descrip - tion to indicate their general tenor and quality .

		* THE LETTERS OF
VICTOR HUGO	PERSON	to his Family , to
Sainte	LOCATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	, and Others .

		Edited by
Paul Meurice	PERSON	.

		First series .

		With portrait .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Miillin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of Hugo 's early ideas of poetic struc - ture are given in a characteristic letter to
M. Louis Pavie	PERSON	, father of
Victor Pavie	PERSON	, written in
1827	DATE	-LRB- Hugo was born in
1802	DATE	-RRB- . ''

		... Tell your young eaglet , dear sir , your
Victor	PERSON	, that there is another
Victor	PERSON	who would envy him if envy could coexist with affection his fine poem on
David	PERSON	, le Juif , la Mer , and le Lac , an ingenious and inspired composition , and above all , his charming elegy of I ' Enfant .

		... If my five-and-twenty years -LRB- for I am near that -RRB- gave me some right of advising his eigh - teen , I should advise him to be more strict about the richness of the rhyme , the only charm of our poetry , and , above all , to strive to confine his thoughts as much as possible within the limits of the regular strophe .

		He can change the rhythm as often as he likes in the same ode , but there should always be an internal regularity in the arrangement of the metre .

		This is the way , in my view , to express an idea more forcibly , to give a more ample harmony to the style and more value to the whole of the composition .

		I do not , however , lay down this as a rule or law , but merely give it for what it is worth , as the result of reflections on the genius of our lyric poetry .

		In his case , thought only needs to develop freely .

		I give some advice to the artist , but I submit it for the approval of the poet ... '' A letter of
January 5 , 1830	DATE	, to the Minister of the Interior , written just before the initial performance of '' Hernani '' at the Comedie Fran9aise , illustrates the bitterness of the great literary feud of the day .

		Hugo had written the drama and submitted it to the government cen - sors .

		Thereafter he says : '' ... This , however , is what has happened since
Hernani	PERSON	has been submitted to the censors .

		Some verses of the drama , partly travestied , or wholly turned into ridicule , a few quoted correctly , but ingeniously dove - tailed with spurious ones , bits of scenes , in fact , more or less skilfully disfigured and outrageously parodied , have been put into circulation .

		Portions of the work dressed up in this way have received the semi-publicity which writers and theatres so justly dread .

		The authors of these underhand tricks have hardly taken the trouble to hide themselves ; they have done it in broad daylight , and have simply selected the newspapers as the medium of their discreet confidences .

		They have gone further .

		Not content with prostituting the piece to their papers , they are now engaged in prostituting it to their salons . ''

		There are only two copies of Hernani in existence besides the one in my house .

		One has been lodged at the theatre ; that is the one used every day for rehearsals .

		As soon as the rehearsal is over the manuscript is put under lock and key .

		The other manuscript is in the censor 's office .

		Now pirated copies are being circulated .

		Where can they come from ?

		I ask once more .

		From the theatre , whose hopes they would blight , whose inter - ests they would ruin , where the greatest caution is ob - served , where the thing is an impossibility , or from the censors ?

		The censorship has one manuscript at its disposal , with which it can do what it likes .

		The cen - sorship is my literary and political enemy .

		It has the privilege of being dishonest and disloyal .

		I impeach the censorship . ''

		The following month Hugo writes triumph - 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, antly to
Paul Lacroix	PERSON	, on returning from the second performance of '' Hernani . '' ''

		Thank you a thousand times , my dear , good friend .

		I see your kind heart in all you do for me .

		I wish you had been at the theatre to-night .

		You would have laughed .

		The classic cabal wanted to bite , and did bite , but thanks to our friends it broke its teeth .

		The third act got some rough treatment , which it will receive for some time to come , but the fourth act silenced opposi - tion , and the fifth went admirably , better even than the first time .

		Mile .

		Mars surpassed herself .

		She was recalled , cheered , and overwhelmed with applause .

		She was enchanted . ''

		I think we are all right now .

		The receipts of the two first nights amounted to nine thousand francs , which is unprecedented at this theatre .

		But we must not rest on our laurels .

		The enemy is on the alert .

		The third performance must discourage them , if possible .

		Therefore , in the name of our cherished literary free - dom , summon the whole clan of brave and faithful friends for
Monday	DATE	.

		I look to you to help me in pulling out this last tooth of the old classic
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the rescue , and advance ! ''

		Hugo 's noble letter -LRB- 1834 -RRB- to
M. Thiers	PERSON	, in behalf of an unfortunate fellow-member of the literary guild , is one of several of like tenor . ''

		Monsieur le
Ministre	LOCATION	, At this moment there is a woman in
Paris	LOCATION	who is dying of hunger . ''

		Her name is Mile .

		Mercosur .

		She has published several volumes of poems ; this is not the place to speak of their merit , and besides , I do not feel qualified to do so ; but her name is doubtless known to you . ''

		In
1823	DATE
King Louis XVIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		spontaneously assigned me a pension or annual allowance of
2000	DATE	francs on the funds of
the Ministry of the Interior	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1832	DATE	I gave up this pension of my own free will .

		At that time your predecessor , M. d'Argout , informed me that he did not accept my surrender of it , that he would continue to consider the money as mine , and that he would not dis - pose of it in favor of anyone .

		As my renunciation was absolute and final , it was no business of mine to see what the Minister would do with the pension . ''

		To-day , while admitting that I have no claim what - ever on this pension , I request you , in case the Minister should have persisted in his resolve , and should not have disposed of the fund to anyone else , to transfer it to Mile .

		Merco3ur .

		If you consent to this , I shall feel doubly pleased at having given it up .

		This pension will be far better bestowed on Mile .

		Mercosur than on me .

		The sum of
1200	DATE	francs , added to what Mile .

		Mercosur already receives , will almost enable her to live with her mother .

		Give it to her , Monsieur le Ministre ; it will be an act of charity .

		We shall both be glad ; you for having done it , and I for having advised it . ''

		From the interesting series of letters to Sainte-Beuve -LRB- 1827-1845 -RRB- we shall allow our - selves a brief extract touching the writer 's polit - ical views in
1832	DATE	. ''

		... It is indeed a sad , but at the same time a fine , subject for a poem , all this folly steeped in bloodshed .

		We shall have a Republic some day , and when it does come it will be a good one .

		But we must not gather in
May	DATE	the fruit which will not be ripe till
August	DATE	.

		We must know how to wait .

		The Republic proclaimed by
France	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	will be the crown of our old age .

		But we must not let our flag be smeared with red by these blackguards .

		For instance , a Fre ` de ` ric
Soulie	PERSON	* , who a year ago was devoted to M. d'Argout 's dramatic quasi - censorship , must not be allowed to bawl out in the mid - dle of a cafe that he is going to make bullets .

		A
Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tan must not be permitted to announce in a pot-house that by the end of the month four splendid guillotines will be permanently set up in the four principal squares of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		People of this kind throw back the political ideas which , but for them , would make progress .

		They frighten the honest tradesman , who is made savage by reaction .

		They make a bugbear of the Republic .

		Ninety - three is not much of a bait .

		We ought to talk a little less of
Robespierre	LOCATION	and a little more of
Washington	LOCATION	... ''
Hugo	PERSON	's letters to his children are charming compositions tender , playful , and filled with the fancies a child loves .

		To his little daughter Didine he writes -LRB- 1837 -RRB- from Boulogne-sur - Mer : '' I have just been walking on the beach and thinking of you , my poor little darling .

		I gathered this flower for you on the sandhills .

		It is a wild pansy , which has been often watered by the foam of the ocean .

		Keep it for daddy 's sake , who is so fond of you .

		I have already sent your mother a flower from the ruins , the Ghent poppy , and now here is a flower from the sea .

		And then , my darling , I wrote your name on the sand ,
Didi	LOCATION	.

		To-night the rising tide will obliterate it , but nothing can ever obliterate your father 's love for you . ''

		I have constantly thought of you , dear child .

		Every fine town I saw made me wish that you , your mother , and your brothers had been with me , and your grand - father , to explain everything to us .

		All day I was look - ing at churches and pictures , and then at night I gazed at the sky , and thought once more of you , my Didine , as I watched that beautiful constellation , the Chariot of God , which I have taught you to distinguish among the stars . ''

		M.
Meurice	ORGANIZATION	's editing of Hugo 's Letters is of the most unobtrusive sort , the volume con - taining no editorial apparatus whatever save a table of contents and some brief footnotes .

		The publishers have done their part in their usual satisfactory way .

		The volume is a model of substantial elegance throughout , the noble typo - graphy calling for special commendation .

		E. G. J. NINETEENTH CENTURY PAINTING .

		* After reading the first volume of Professor
Muther	PERSON	's rather ponderous '' History of Mod - ern Painting , '' one is inclined to think that its author 's merit should be handsomely allowed .

		It is well written , critically accurate , and con - tinuous in its development .

		With the second volume , matters begin to grow somewhat com - plicated ; the writer meets with contemporary * THE HISTORY OF MODERN PAINTING .

		By
Richard Mather	PERSON	.

		In three volumes , with illustrations .


New York	LOCATION	: The
Macmillan Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 men and their works ; there is not so much his - torical perspective ; the body of established art criticism offers less suggestion and support ; the continuity is rather shattered .

		With the third volume one begins to realize the awfulness of a German philosophy of history .

		Men and facts are pushed out of all chronology and se - quence , and we are dragged from
Germany	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	, from
Japan	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, and asked to consider this man or that man simply as an illustration of Professor
Muther	PERSON	's theories .

		When one finally puts down the work and tries to recall its impression as a whole , he has dif - ficulty in obtaining a good negative .

		Either his perception is not good , or the plate has been befogged .

		The latter is really the case .

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	has sacrificed clearness and continuity to theory , system , and classification .

		The introduction to the first volume explains that this sacrifice is in measure intentional .

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	lays no claim to an objective treatment of history .

		He declares that his work is '' no more than a piece of art-history seen through the medium of a temperament . ''

		But that is about all any history is or can be .

		All writing is temperamental ; but then there are temperaments and there are temperaments .

		Some are content with recording a plain under - standing of facts in chronological order and allowing that to stand as history ; others are disposed toward the philosophical system with concatenated sub-divisions under which men and their doings are placed as props for the system .

		The philosophy of history is not to be sneered at , but in order to be serviceable it should at least be comprehensible .

		Nor is logic a non-essential in the writing of history ; but again , to be serviceable it should at least be convincing .

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	in his introduc - tion to the second volume asks : '' Is history governed by the laws of logic ? ''

		Yes ; but what may be logic to the writer may have no logical meaning whatever to the reader , and the weak - ness of Professor
Muther	PERSON	's history is a prepon - derance of what he esteems philosophy and logic .

		If it were not for a non-philosophical non-logical index of painters ' names at the end of each volume , the real value of this work would be materially lessened .

		But the reader should have an outline of Professor
Muther	PERSON	's temperamental system .

		The history begins with the discovery of the modern spirit in painting .


Hogarth	PERSON	,
Reynolds	PERSON	, and
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, are put down as its representatives .

		We are then taken to
Spain	LOCATION	, where
Goya	ORGANIZATION	is resurrected as a typical innovator and revolutionist in art and put on the shelf with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	as compan - ions .

		Then we are taken to
Germany	LOCATION	and intro - duced to
Winckelmann	PERSON	and the revised classic ; then to
France	LOCATION	, to see classicism with
David	PERSON	; then there is a chapter on the attempt to escape from tradition ; and there are chapters on the Italian tradition in
Germany	LOCATION	, romanticism , In - gres and the classic reaction , the post-romantic painters like
Cabanel	PERSON	,
Lefebvre	PERSON	and
Delau	PERSON	- nay , the schools in
Belgium	LOCATION	, and the German colorists like
Makart	PERSON	.

		After these comes a chapter in which we go back in French his - tory to Gleyre ,
Hamon	LOCATION	, and
Boulanger	PERSON	, with whom we find curiously associated
Leys	PERSON	,
Becker	PERSON	,
Menzel	PERSON	, and
Meissonier	PERSON	.

		This last chapter is somewhat hazy , giving indication of what is to come ; but from the first volume we learn one of Professor
Muther	PERSON	's theories .

		Art is tossed back and forth like a tennis-ball , from classicism to romanticism , until at last it falls to earth and becomes realism .

		The theory is quite just , and is supported by the facts .

		The second volume begins with the '' Victory of the Moderns '' which means that painting has reached a point where actual life rather than tradition is its inspiration .

		The second chapter takes up '' English Painting to
1850	DATE	, '' and deals with
Romney	PERSON	,
Hoppner	PERSON	,
Beechey	PERSON	, and others .

		Now why should these men be separated by five hundred pages from
Reynolds	PERSON	and
Gainsborough	PERSON	?

		They were all influenced by Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, were all of the same school , pro- duced a similar art , and should have been treated together .

		Directly we are through with them we are hurried off to the military painters in
France Vernet	LOCATION	,
Raffet	LOCATION	,
Charlet	PERSON	, who be - longed to
Delacroix	ORGANIZATION	's time ; and to the
Orien	PERSON	- talists Decamps ,
Marilhat	PERSON	,
Fromentin	PERSON	, who were just as much the product of romanticism as
Delacroix	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Why were they not con - sidered under romanticism , three hundred pages back ?

		And why , under any historical or philosophical system , should men like
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Goodall	PERSON	and
Pasini	PERSON	be put in the same chapter with them , since they have nothing in common but subject ?

		But Professor
Muther	PERSON	has been treating , first , of movements like clas - sicism and romanticism ; then he tries art - history by countries , and in this second volume he thinks to try it by subjects .

		So we have chapters on the '' Painting of Humorous Anec - dote , '' dealing with the genre painters of Ger - many ; '' The Picture with a Social Purpose , '' where
Delacroix	PERSON	,
Meissonier	PERSON	, and
Wiertz	PERSON	are brought together ; '' The Village Tale , '' which 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, introduces
Knaus	PERSON	, Defregger , and
Jules Bre	PERSON	- ton , but omits
Theodore Frere	PERSON	, Millet , and
Bastien	PERSON	; chapters upon landscape which are thoroughly good ; and finally we are brought with a bump to '' Realism in
France	LOCATION	, '' which means Gourbet ,
Stevens	PERSON	, and Vollon , '' Real - ism in
England	LOCATION	, '' which means
Holman	PERSON	Hunt and the Pre -
Raphaelites	PERSON	, and `` Realism in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' which means
Menzel	PERSON	,
Leibl	PERSON	, and
Lenbach	PERSON	.

		This loud pa3an of realism would seem to mark the grand finale of the second volume ; but Professor
Muther	PERSON	winds on for three chapters more , telling us about the '' Problem of the Modern Intuition of Color '' -LRB- a luminous caption -RRB- , in which the realists be - fore mentioned are credited with arriving at maturity in color the inference being that
Chardin	LOCATION	and
Corot	LOCATION	before them had not arrived .

		There is a digressive chapter just here on Ho - kusai and the Japanese , the object of it being to explain the Japanese influence upon
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean art ; and then we have for a last chapter ''
Fiat	ORGANIZATION	Lux , '' in which impressionism is consid - ered as realism widened by the study of the milieu .

		One might think that a chapter devoted to impressionism
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Renoir	ORGANIZATION	, and their con - temporaries would be about the last word on modern art , and that when the brains were out the book would end .

		But no ; there is a third volume , and the opening chapter calls us cheer - fully back to consider Bastien-Lepage , L'her - mitte , and others who sprang from the
Courbet	PERSON	- Millet initiative and should have been treated under '' Realism in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		They are , how - ever , grouped under '' Painters of Life , '' and the chapters are again taken up by countries .

		Leighton ,
Poynter	LOCATION	, and their adherents are dis - cussed under ''
England	LOCATION	, '' and then Professor
Muther	PERSON	wanders from
Bagdad	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	through chapters on
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, before he again brings us around to
England	LOCATION	to take up
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Burne-Jones	PERSON	, who should have been placed in point of time and school with
Holman	PERSON	Hunt nineteen chapters back , and
Watts	PERSON	, who belongs with
Leighton	PERSON	and
Poynter	ORGANIZATION	, ten chapters back .

		The reason for this ramble is apparent in the book headings .

		Leighton and Poynter are classified as '' Paint - ers of Life , '' while
Rosetti	PERSON	,
Burne-Jones	PERSON	, and
Watts	PERSON	are pigeon-holed as `` New Idealists . ''

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	's nomenclature is ingenuous and his classification perhaps philosophical , but was it worth while dislocating all the bones of chronology and breaking the neck of continuity to attain them ?

		Whistler is evidently a round stone who will not fit into a square hole , how - ever philosophical it may be made ; and so he is placed in a separate chapter under `` Whist - ler and the Scotch Painters '' a chapter that will doubtless make its chief subject smile .

		And so , barring a sporadic return to
Bocklin	PERSON	and German art , tagged on apparently as an after-thought , the three - volumed work comes to an end .

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	's history is a good illus - tration of a philosophical system , clear enough to its author 's mind , proving a cloud - bank to the mind of the reader .

		Chronology , na - tionality , historical sequence , and school influ - ence are sacrificed to various '' isms '' known in the creed of German esthetics and '' seen through the medium of a temperament . ''

		This would not be matter of much regret were the work as confused in detail as it is in plan .

		It could then be pushed aside and forgotten .

		But this work can not be so treated .

		In just appre - ciation of art , in critical estimates of painters , in keen analysis of motives , it is by all odds the best history of nineteenth century painting yet written .

		Used as a reference book by the aid of the index , it is invaluable in its critical summaries .

		Moreover , it is correct in its facts .

		There are slips here and there , as there must be in every history dates wrong , names mis - spelled , picture titles erroneously given but these are small matters to be overlooked .

		Gen - erally speaking , the work is accurate in fact and sound in judgment .

		It is not to be sup - posed that any one man can deal thoroughly with all phases of modern art , in all coun - tries with equal knowledge .

		Professor
Muther	PERSON	is at his best in dealing with German art ; but he understands modern painting in
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, the Low Countries ,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	very well .

		The chapter on Russian painting is written in collaboration with
Alexandre Benois	PERSON	, and the chapter on American paint - ing is somewhat scrappy the author never having been here .

		For what
America	LOCATION	has done and is doing , he relies upon books and what he has seen of American art in the
Paris	LOCATION	Salons .

		This has misled him into saying of American painters generally that '' their art is an exact echo of that of
Europe	LOCATION	, because they have learnt their technique in the leading
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean academies . ''

		After such a statement it is not surprising to find the Parisian and
Munich	LOCATION	contingents of American painters re - ceiving full notice , while men at home , like
Healy	PERSON	,
Eastman Johnson	PERSON	,
Thayer	PERSON	,
Simmons	PERSON	,
Smedley	PERSON	, Brush ,
Blashfield	LOCATION	, and
Mowbray	PERSON	are
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 omitted altogether .

		Among our landscapists , too , there is mention of Inness ,
Tryon	PERSON	,
Murphy	PERSON	, Ranger ; but not a word about Homer Mar - tin ,
Wyant	PERSON	,
Bunce	PERSON	,
Platt	PERSON	,
Dearth	LOCATION	, or
Horatio Walker	PERSON	.

		Still , with all its small faults and its bewil - dering classification , Professor
Muther	PERSON	's his - tory has very decided merits .

		It is the first history of nineteenth century painting that has any pretension to completeness ; it treats paint - ing as painting rather than as story-telling upon canvas ; and it is written in a bright , free style , with a candid spirit , both of which merits peo - ple will not fail to appreciate .

		Considering the difficulties of such a task as the author set for himself , it is somewhat remarkable that he has come off so well .

		He has produced a work of no commonplace character ; and after devoting so much space to pointing out its defects , it is worth while to insist that it has virtues which far out-balance its faults .

		It will not become obsolete very soon .

		Readers and writers will soon discover its value , and to both of them it will prove a mine of facts for many years to come .

		The translation is not too well done , and it strains good English at times to the breaking point .

		The attempt to render literal meanings is not happy , and sometimes it is quite shocking as , for instance , in the chapter on ''
Whistler	LOCATION	and the Scotch Painters , '' in which men like
Lavery	PERSON	and
Guthrie	PERSON	are referred to as the * ' Boys of
Glasgow	LOCATION	'' and the '' Glasgow Boys . ''

		It can not be supposed that Professor
Muther	PERSON	would be so familiar or so undignified as to use such expressions about men as old as himself .

		The translator has simply failed to comprehend the text .

		There is great wealth of illustration in the volumes some fifteen hundred '' half-tones , '' many of them good and some of them bad .

		It could not very well be otherwise .

		The photo - graphy of pictures is still a problem , the color element wrecking , for reproductive purposes , about three photographs out of four .

		Again , many of the best pictures for historical illustra - tion have never been photographed and are inaccessible .

		The historian must do what he can , not what he would ; and Professor
Muther	PERSON	, considering the circumstances , has done as well as could be expected .

		STUDIES IN EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY .

		* Of late years there has been a marked ten - dency among students of American history to devote attention to early colonial history , the original inspiration , no doubt , coming from the work of
John Richard Green	PERSON	in English his - tory .

		The development of the spirit of genea - logical research , greatly stimulated by the formation and growth of patriotic hereditary societies , has had as an accompaniment the awakening of interest in the old town records , and in the less important but equally instruc - tive personal memoranda of the American col - onists .

		Mr.

		Beneath Old Roof Trees , '' by Mr.
Abram English Brown	PERSON	, is certain to please anyone who cares for the heroes of the Revolution .

		The binding shows the old bell-tower in
Lexington	LOCATION	, with an accompanying picture of a minute-man , ploughing in the field , but all ready to drop the implements of husbandry for the musket and the powder-horn which his boy is bringing him from the house .

		Stories of the great struggle for liberty are told as they have been gathered from the lips of old people , here and there , the veritable sons and daughters of the Revo - lution .

		There are pictures of historic homes , many of them now bearing tablets , which tell of their connection with the dawn of Independ - ence .

		There are inscriptions from many mon - uments , there are fragments from diaries , there are bits of song and story ; in fact , there seems to be a complete collection of material illustra - tive of the part played in the Revolution by the people from the towns located on both sides of a line drawn from

		There is quite a bit of new matter presented in this popular form , and the volume is welcomed as a desirable part of the literature which is familiarizing Americans of this day with the life of the fathers , and familiarizing them with it in such a way that even in the midst of the quaint and curious the reader learns to under - stand better the motives that controlled the dwellers in '' Old Colony Days . ''

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has been generous in giving to the students of various phases of American life the rich results of her investigations in the store - houses of colonial lore . ''

		The Sabbath in Puri - tan
New England	LOCATION	, '' '' Customs and Fashions of Old
New England	LOCATION	, '' `` The Diary of
Anna Green Winslow	PERSON	, '' '' Colonial Dames and Good Wives , '' '' Costumes of Colonial Times , '' The Life of
Margaret Winthrop	PERSON	, '' such are the themes that have been exhaustively treated by her , to make no mention of magazine articles dealing with old china , flower gardens , strange and curious punishments , and other subjects suggested by hints from musty books , court records , old letters , and forgotten laws .

		In treating '' Colonial Days in
New York	LOCATION	, '' diffi - culties presented themselves at once .

		Contem - porary chronicles are rare .

		There was no
Sewall	PERSON	and no
Winthrop	LOCATION	.

		The diary-writing minister was not a Dutch character .

		Mrs.
Anne Grant	PERSON	had told the story of the life of '' An American Lady '' wherein Miss
Schuyler	PERSON	's experiences cast light upon the social conditions of the colony ;
Madame Sarah Knight	PERSON	had included the colony in the itinerary of her carefully described travels , and others had studied special features of the social history ; but there was no wealth of materials .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has , however , been equal to her task , for in '' Colonial Days in Old
New York	LOCATION	'' the life in
New Netherlands	LOCATION	may be followed from the birth of the child and the rocking in the hooded cradle , until the coffin was lowered into the grave , with its attendant feasting and drinking and giving of funeral rings and scarfs and gloves .

		The education of the child , the dress of child and man , the cus - toms of courtship and marriage , the furniture , linen , eatables , drinkables , and dishes of the home , the beginnings of municipal life with its necessary police and sanitary regulations , all these find place in the story .

		The hard life of the schoolmaster , who sometimes eked out his slender income by doing washing or digging graves ; the difficulties of the physician , who sought a monopoly of shaving to add to his revenue ; the ever-present problem of domestic service , and the busy industry of the women for which
New Netherlands	LOCATION	was noted , such are the varied subjects that are discussed .

		There were generally-celebrated holidays , such as New Year 's Day ,
May Day	DATE	, Shrove-Tide , Gunpowder Day , and the forgotten anniver - sary called '' Pinkster Day , '' when the negroes had much liberty , and gave way to excesses of drinking and dancing and barbaric music .

		More pleasure seems to have been allowed than in
Puritan New England	LOCATION	, their pastimes rang - ing from simple strawberrying to the theatre and horse-racing .

		Perhaps the most instruc - tive feature of Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's study is the setting forth of the position of women in the colony .

		They shared the property of their husbands , oftentimes managed large business interests , sometimes even served as attorneys in court , and in general had a higher standing in the community than did their
New England	LOCATION	sisters .

		But a paragraph can hardly do justice to this interesting volume of three hundred pages , each one of which has something worth noting in a study of social life .

		The cover of the book anticipates the delights of the contents .

		It is distinctively Dutch , reproducing the design of a white and blue cloth , and decorated with sug - gestive windmill , beaver , and beer keg .

		A much more pretentious work is '' The Puritan in
England	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Ezra Hoyt Byington	PERSON	.

		The title has a familiar sound , and comparison is at once sug - gested with other volumes that have covered much the same ground .

		But the reader leaves the book , thoroughly satisfied with the author .

		In the first place , it is an attractive volume
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 typographically , a good example of modern his - torical book-making .

		The type is large and clear , the margins are wide , and everything is present that is desirable in the way of enlarged table of contents , bibliography , page divisions , and index .

		One may read awhile and stop , without losing the story , for the method is top - ical , the author having used the substance of the several chapters as addresses before organ - izations of sympathetic nature .

		There are eight of these special themes : '' The Puritan in En - gland , '' '' The Pilgrim and the Puritan : Which ? ''

		The Early Ministers of New En - gland , '' ''
William Pynchon	PERSON	,
Gent.	LOCATION	, '' '' Family and Social Life of the Puritans , '' '' Religious Opinions of the Fathers of
New England	LOCATION	, '' '' The Case of Reverend
Robert Breck	PERSON	, of
Springfield	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Religious Life in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	in Northern New En - gland , '' the last a study of
Brunswick	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		The first chapter gives a clear and concise ac - count of the development of the Puritan party in
England	LOCATION	, without any of the long quotations from contemporary sermons which too often only befog the student when he is seeking for light .

		No one can read it without feeling a sense of gratitude to the author for his simple story , and without a better appreciation of the character and the purposes of the men who , as Pilgrims and Puritans , laid the foundations of the
New England	LOCATION	colonies .

		The same clear - ness marks the chapter on religious opinions , where the various differences are discussed .

		A special case of theological investigation is de - scribed in
Springfield	LOCATION	, where attempts were made to prevent the settlement as pastor of
Robert Breck	PERSON	.

		There are a great many pages in the book that tell of the social life of the Puritan , and indicate that there was more attention paid to the graces and refinements of life than is usually thought .

		In some of the volumes dealing with the homes of the period , the quaint and curious seem to be mentioned merely for the entertainment of the reader .

		In this study , the relation of the various features of society to the history of the time is well brought out , the philosophy of the Puritan regime being prominent .

		Now and then there is an apparent inconsistency , as , for example , where in one paragraph the treatment of the
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	is not excused by the fact that Quakers everywhere were being persecuted , while in the next paragraph the witchcraft delusion is smoothed over because the belief in witchcraft was common throughout the world .

		But on the whole the author treats his themes in a way to win commendation , and to secure for his book its proper place among the best of those that furnish insight into Puritan life and character .

		Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	's study of the
Province of Quebec	ORGANIZATION	in its relation to the early days of the Amer - ican Revolution is associated with the four volumes already discussed only by the law of contrast , since it represents an entirely different method of investigation of historical problems connected with Anglo-American colonial life .

		There were other English colonies in
America	LOCATION	besides the thirteen which revolted .

		Why did they ` not join the Revolution ?

		What was the effect of the success of the thirteen upon the political life of the others ?

		Such questions were in the mind of the writer as he began his investigations , only to find that he must confine himself to the Province of
Quebec	LOCATION	alone .

		The central point of the study is the
Quebec	LOCATION	Act of
1774	DATE	, which is considered both as an institu - tional measure and as an irritating aid to the discontent of the colonists south of the St. Law - rence .

		Conclusions are reached which are widely at variance with those usually held by writers of our history .

		It is considered that the provisions of the Quebec Act were neither occasioned nor appreciably affected by condi - tions in the other colonies , and that the meas - ure was not effectual in keeping the Canadians loyal in the time of prevailing discontent .

		Most writers have expressed the belief that the Que - bec Act was highly beneficial to the province affected by it .

		Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	's investigations have convinced him that , on the contrary , it was really one of the most unwise and disastrous measures in English Colonial history .

		So far as the
United States	LOCATION	were concerned , interest in the
Quebec	LOCATION	Act ceased after independence had been secured ; but , for
Canada	LOCATION	, influences were set in motion which have had unfortunate results ever since .

		Space will not allow con - sideration of the several very interesting phases of the subject ; but it is to be said that this monograph is a valuable contribution to Amer - ican history , written in good style , with abun - dant references to sustain conclusions , with illustration afforded by the experience of the
United States	LOCATION	as the Act is considered after a century and a quarter , and with a bibliography of the most important authorities .

		The Quebec Act and the
Quebec	LOCATION	Revenue Act , both of the year
1774	DATE	, accompany the study as original documents .

		254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, THE INTELLECTUAL , METHOD isr PSYCHOLOGY .

		* Psychologists are now divided into three hostile camps .

		In the first are the physiolog - ical psychologists , who interpret all mental states by organic changes or motor activities ; in the second are those who base all mind on feeling and will , and , being rather a small school , have not as yet received any distinctive name ; in the third are the intellectualists , who see in knowledge the fundamental element in mental life .

		And these three standpoints , it must be noted , are the only possible ones , and all three have now their enthusiastic adherents .

		The intellectual is the oldest and most nat - ural of the three methods .

		On awaking
this morning	TIME	did there not first come to your mind a flood of sensations , of sights , sounds , con - tacts , etc. which you interpreted ?

		And when you found an interesting sensation produced , let us say , by a pretty picture on the wall you dwelt upon it .

		But suddenly you hear a sound , which you interpret as the breakfast bell ; this incites a considerable emotion , which in turn incites to lively action ; you hurriedly arise and dress .

		That all mind is based on a series of given presentations , which are interpreted by thought , is the doctrine not only of common reflection , but of the most ancient philosophy of mediaeval scholasticism , and of most modern philosophy and psychology as well .

		It is the standpoint of the work on '' Analytic Psychology '' now before us .

		These two large volumes are writ - ten by Mr.
G. F. Stout	PERSON	, who is best known as editor of the English psychological review , '' Mind , '' and consist largely of summaries and discussions founded upon Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	,
James	PERSON	,
Bradley	PERSON	,
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bain	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work has some originality of treatment , and at all times the position advanced is carefully re-thought and re - stated in the writer 's own way , although we think quotation is sometimes over - done .

		While this book is in no sense popular , it will yet appeal strongly to all critical stu - dents of psychology ; and while we can not count ourselves among the intellectual school , we yet readily recognize the service of honest and able thought from that point of view .

		With this general appreciation , let us pass to some criti - cisms which might be of interest to the general reader .

		The average layman , after reading the chap - * ANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY .

G. F. Stout	PERSON	, Fellow of

		ter on `` Pleasure and Pain , '' will no doubt exclaim , '' What a pother about so simple a thing !

		Of course , when I am in pain it means there is something the matter ; all is not go - ing on right ; I do not need learned terms like ' arrest of mental activity ' or ' disturbance of equilibrium , ' and pages of discussion about facts as self-evident as that the heart pumps blood and the lungs breathe air . ''

		The present reviewer appreciates this objection , and thinks that psychologists are but too apt to turn tru - isms into disputable principles .

		Mr.
Stout	PERSON	's discussion does not bring out the real difficulty , which is that all effort is in itself painful .

		For example , my attention to the point now under consideration is hard and painful to me ; and that not as a hindrance to my doing something else , for there is nothing I want to do , but in itself as task and effort .

		The pain of that most useful , salutary , and satisfactory action in the world , endeavor at top-notch , seems quite in - trinsic .

		Mr.
Stout	PERSON	devotes much space to Attention ; and one section on '' Interest and Attention '' invites some remarks .

		The problem , put con - cretely , is this : Do you attend to a thing because you are interested in it , or are you in - terested because you attend ?

		or is there no '' because '' in the case , only the fact that we find the two together ?

		Mr.
Stout	PERSON	thinks that interest is the '' hedonic aspect '' of attention , thus maintaining the intellectualist form of the last position , the emotionalist form being that attention is a volitional aspect of interest , though both indicate a certain causality .

		How - ever , we must confess at the start to a prejudice against all '' aspect '' theories .

		What do we gain by saying that one phenomenon is simply the reverse side of another , except to appease our ignorance by a doubtful metaphor ? ''

		As - pect '' is at best no other than a metaphysical dualism , or pluralism , brought in as scientific explanation .

		, But let us turn to a simple case for facts .

		As I have some interest in old books , I often stop at a stall and let my eye wander over the books there exposed .

		I see a multitude of books that do not hold my attention ; but sud - denly an old book attracts me .

		As this added interest makes me more attentive , I perceive that it is an incuncibulum , which interest in - creases my attention , and I find it to be a very rare Aldine .

		This process , which began as interest awakening attention , and goes on by attention increasing interest , and interest atten - tion , by rapid steps , is a typical case which
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 can not be construed as '' hedonic aspect '' ex - cept by ignoring analysis , and this analytic psy - chology can not do .

		It is true enough , as Mr.
Stout	PERSON	says -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 226 -RRB- , that we can not feel satisfied with an object unless we have already begun to attend to it ; but why do we begin to attend to it , except at the prompting of some interest ?

		It is obvious that we must see a thing before we can take an interest in the thing as seen ; but it is because we have some interest that we look for it or at it .

		And the initiatory interest is often something quite obscure and hereditary .

		For instance , the fact that moving objects always draw our attention in preference to non-moving , that a fleet under way is more interesting than at anchor , are doubtless due to the ingrained structure of mind , since organisms have always from the begin - ning found themselves most vitally affected by the moving objects .

		It is the moving object which may be food , or an enemy , or a mate ; and so the moving as a whole becomes more interesting than the stationary .

		We can con - ceive the opposite as the case , that the sta - tionary might have been the most significant and most interesting for life .

		THE ESSAYS OF MRS. MEYNEL.I , .

		* It is not easy to know just how to deal with the new volumes by which Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	is pre - sented to American readers by American pub - lishers .

		The appearance of a new edition of her first collection of essays reminds one imme - diately that there must be many who already know her work .

		We surely can not speak of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	as though she were some new writer , some recent addition to the galaxy of nowaday talent .

		And yet we can not very well speak of her new volume as if everyone were familiar with her work , as if we had here some - thing which the public would read and ap - preciate with a certain reference to what has gone before .

		The fact is , I suppose , that the work of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, though long known to one and another , is only now becoming generally known to the public , at least in this country .

		century of discovery .

		In the former time they discovered pretty much all the places in the world , which had till that time lived in happy seclusion : nowadays they discover everything else .

		In literature , where the tendency is as manifest as in science , religion , daily life , and so on , the spirit used to be called Naturalism ; the idea being that there were no secrets of the soul , or body either , which the novelist might not expose .

		Naturalism , however , seems now to have had its day ; and the momentary form of the spirit of discovery , as applied to liter - ature , is the effort to bring all writers into a breezy popularity .

		There are periodicals chiefly for this purpose , and special columns for the same purpose in other papers .

		The aim is to make everybody who has written anything a public character .

		One good result of such a hustling , up-to - date quality in the average writer about books is naturally that everything good receives a wider currency ; that every good author has a larger audience ; that thousands of readers , who would otherwise be confined to a few writers whom their bookseller happened to know of , have a more widely extended horizon .

		Any - one who can have any objection to the process would seem to be a dog in the manger .

		Still , looking at the matter from another side , there must be many who see their specially selected authors rise into the limelight of literary gossip with something of the feeling with which one goes to a sequestered and personal spot in the woods , and finds a large picnic of , say , the Im - proved Order of Polish Invincibles .

		Very good people they are , certainly , and it is nice that they should have a good time ; still , the world is large , and this particular place was my fav - orite .

		Whether or not Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	has really been discovered of late , we can not say ; still , it would seem so .

		One may see her picture in better or worse reproduction ; one may read anecdotes about herself and her husband ; one may learn what
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	thought of her poems .

		So far as this brings her books to more persons who can read and love them , so much the better .

		It would not appear on the whole , however , that Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's genius was such as would appeal to a very extended circle .

		But it is hard to tell ; some of her things take such a personal hold on one that it seems impossible anyone else should care for them at all ; and yet undoubtedly the number of her readers has been steadily increasing , in
England	LOCATION	and in this country .

		Her essays , how - 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ever , are certainly not such as one could imag - ine widely popular .

		Emerson may be said to be popular in a way : there is a sort of catho - licity to him ; he wants to speak to everybody .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, on the other hand , seems to speak especially to a few ; she speaks in a way that will not appeal to everybody , and often of things that not everybody will understand .

		These essays have in them , doubtless , some of the best prose work in their kind that has lately been done in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is a careful prose , not exactly polished , but rather delicate ; a kind of work not often seen , for those who might aspire to such work are apt to invalidate their results by affectation and mannerism .

		It abounds in implied discrimination , and has a certain taste for epigram , for a sort of senten - tiousness even .

		It drifts not seldom into im - agery ; one must remember a good deal to real - ize much of it , just as one must have read more or less to pass competently through its allusive - ness .

		Like the prose of Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	, it has generally the quality of urbanity , the tone of the centre that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	sometimes spoke of .

		If anything , it vexes one by being over-conscious , or rather too elaborate , very rarely by lack of ideas .

		There are ideas enough , although one can not easily say just what kind of ideas .

		Certainly they are not '' great thoughts '' as a rule , and yet the work is hardly ever fantastic or fussy .

		The essays are on different subjects ; it is diffi - cult to classify them .

		Some are on art , some on literature , some on nature or other matters , but more than is usually the case with such col - lections do we get from the book an impression of unity in a sentiment , or an attitude toward life .

		The interest of the book lies not so much in its treatment of this or that topic as in its exhibition -LRB- or , as that is a somewhat obtrusive word , let us rather say an embodiment -RRB- of a temperament , almost of a way of life .

		Surely not a common temperament , and just how useful a way of life , at least here in
America	LOCATION	, we shall not now inquire ; but at least it is a way that has its own charm and attraction .

		When these essays , or some of them , first ap - peared in the '' National Observer '' they doubt - less gave a distinct touch to each issue .

		Now that they are brought together they are best read with reference to the whole of which each forms a part .

		Excellent ideas well expressed , each in itself , may be readily found ; but the combined effect of thought and style is the thing really worthy of note .

		DIVERSE ASPECTS OF SOCIAL , PROBLEMS .

		* Every man who thinks is making some attempt to construct an image or a system of human society .

		Some are reducing the product of their mental effort to writing , using the analyses of previous writers and adding something from personal observation and reflection .

		Professor
Fairbanks	PERSON	's `` Introduction to Sociol - ogy '' is a very readable text-book , and deserves the notice of students of social science .

		The preface contains the caution that it is not the author 's expec - tation that '' the specialist in sociological investiga - tion will find much here to advance the knowledge of the science . ''

		The work is a brief outline of a vast field , with suggestion rather than exhaustive treatment .

		Society is defined as a group of men who live together in relations more or less perma - nent . ''

		Psychology deals with man in society , while sociology deals with the psychical life which arises when men enter into organic union ; the subject of the two sciences is the same , and the difference between them is simply a difference of standpoint . ''

		Sociology does not supplant economics , politics , ethics , but lays a foundation for them .

		Its office is twofold : to treat the general structure of society , its organs and their functions ; and to deal with the laws governing social progress .

		Society may be called an '' organism , '' if we are careful to distin - guish between the biological and psychical values of the word .

		Society has a physical basis ; derives all its force from the physical world ; is modified by race , locality , climate , flora , and fauna .

		The bond which unites men in groups is psychical rather than physical , and is due to sentiment and common ac - tivities .

		It is the product of development , rather than an original gift .

		The unity of society is the unity of a social mind .

		Language and thought , habit and virtue , are developed only in society .

		The causes of social activity are motives felt by the indi - vidual , and these stimuli are original and derived .

		The forms of social activity and the social aggre - gates should be classified according to the stimuli .

		THE DIAL 257 This gives the basis for a classification of social phenomena as economic , social -LRB- in a narrow sense -RRB- , political , psychical .

		The domestic life is , strangely enough , classed under the second head , and this introduces confusion , since the family is unique in having all the elements of social life in elementary form .

		These various forms of social activity are treated in detail .

		The second part of the task is to trace the laws of social progress and development .

		The life of society is continuous and unified .

		The process of social development is explained in a dis - cussion of the phenomena of dispersion and differ - entiation , of agglomeration and assimilation .

		There is a tendency to persistence of physical and psy - chical characteristics ; but modifications and new combinations are effected by the contact of races .

		But these processes of development need to be ex - plained by their causes .

		The causes are found in the various forces at work in '' natural selection . ''

		Biology reveals the facts of multiplication , variation , persistence of type , and survival of the fittest .

		These forces are modified by sexual selection , gregarious and family instincts , so that contest is rather between groups than between individuals .

		In the case of man , the struggle is modified by the organization of the group , by the territorial extension of communication and competition , and by the development of reason .

		But struggle never ceases at any stage , and it is the condition of progress .

		The student of contemporary society will not find in this '' Introduction '' direc - tions for discipline in direct and personal observa - tion of social phenomena .

		He will be encouraged to believe that the sources of knowledge are books , and he will find an excellent selected list for his reading .

		At the same time the work will be found helpful in the early stages of study and suggestive to advanced students .

		Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	is always readable and inter - esting .

		He has a delightful way of presenting the optimistic view of the economic situation of our age .

		In his work on '' Classes and Masses '' one is borne along on a placid stream of the '' natural working of economic forces , '' without a wave of trouble to disturb his peace in this best possible world .

		The ingenious gentleman has a deft way of ignoring the fearful struggle through which the working people of
England	LOCATION	have passed to gain what they have gained , and of leaving on all minds the impression that the only function of a social student is to sit far above the roar of the multitude and philosophize about the inevitable tendency of wise investments to make the wage-earners wealthy if not happy .

		His account of the rise of wages , decrease of pau - perism , and cheapening of the necessities of life , is the popular and picturesque form of the discoveries of
Giffin	LOCATION	,
Levi	PERSON	, and other statistical authorities .

		It is the truth but not by any means the whole truth .

		If Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's book should produce in opti - mistic minds a feeling of profound contentment with our industrial and political institutions , a wakening spur may be found in the book called '' King
Mam	ORGANIZATION	- mon. '' About all that has been said by revolu - tionists against the '' capitalistic regime '' is stated or hinted in the turgid pages of this volume .

		The chief cause of our social evils is found in the right to make a bequest .

		Estates should be divided by probate courts .

		There are too many words for the argument .

		Students of social movements need to keep in close and constant touch with the views of working - men in regard to their own industries .

		In Mr.
Gallon	PERSON	's collection of essays on '' Workers and their Industries , '' we hear the wage-workers speak for themselves and in their own industrial dialect .

		The editor calls attention , in his preface , to certain ideas which frequently recur in the various discussions , '' the tendency of our present industrial system to produce a steady divorce of the worker from any - thing like a complete knowledge of the trade . ''

		But they also recognize the fact that this specialization will help to secure larger leisure and income .

		There seems to be an agreement that apprentices should be admitted in limited numbers and under more strict regulations , and that legislative protection and con - trol should be extended .

		Technical processes are somewhat minutely described , in order to indicate their influence upon the health , wages , and char - acter of the wage-earners .

		In
1851	DATE	,
Karl Marx	PERSON	wrote a series of letters for the ''
New York	LOCATION	Tribune , '' giving his explanation of the European crisis of
1848	DATE	.

		He was then living in
England	LOCATION	, in poverty and exile .

		The letters now appear in book form , with the title '' Revolution and Counter-Revolution . ''

		They are fine examples of the biting sarcasm , trenchant style , and keen though partial insight into the meaning of events , which characterized the great socialist .

		His explanation of historic events by tracing them to economic needs and changes is in accordance with his general phi - losophy of history Hegelianism turned upside down .

		The author 's personal share in the agitation , and his editorial experience , give the book much of the value of a contemporary recital .

		To a citizen of the North who desires to under - stand the social conditions that led up to our Civil War the book entitled '' Southern Sidelights , '' by Mr.
Edward Ingle	PERSON	, will furnish valuable materials .

		The treatment is fragmentary , but it has a compre - hensive basis , and original sources are used for the materials of all chapters .

		The topics discussed are full of interest : traits of the people , phases of indus - try , education , literature , plans for progress , slavery and the crisis .

		The statistical materials are ar - ranged with reference to proof and instruction , and they could not easily be found elsewhere in accessi - ble form .

		Twenty pages of tables fill the valuable appendix .

		The tone of the book is judicial , and the argument will help to correct the provincial and sectional prejudices which hinder the moral union of
North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		In connection with Mr.
Ingle	PERSON	's book , one may well read '' Race Traits and Tendencies of the
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
F. L. Hoffman	PERSON	.

		The revelations of this treatise are truly discouraging .

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, The author appears to consider philanthropic efforts to establish schools and churches among the negroes as a positive injury to them .

		He shows that , on the whole , there has been a great increase of pau - perism , crime , and sexual immorality among the freedmen , parallel with the growth of churches and schools .

		But the author himself suggests that we can accept his facts without taking his conclusions .

		May it not be that a different method of education and a more ethical religious teaching might have shown different results ?

		It is hard to believe that free schools and churches are good for whites but destructive to blacks .

		The author himself shows that his only hope lies in preaching , since each chap - ter closes with a pungent sermon on domestic mor - ality and thrift .

		He seems to have made too little of the political blunder of making a gift of suffrage instead of offering it as a prize ; of the reaction from absolute dependence under slavery to sudden liberty without a period of preparation and proba - tion .

		Thus we may account for the phenomena of degradation very easily without impeaching the only agencies which have prevented a much worse con - dition of immorality .

		At the same time , mission - aries and teachers and philanthropists are under obligations to soberly consider the reasonings of this depressing and pathetic recital of disappointment and temporary defeat .

		We have much to learn as to the best methods of dealing with defective classes .

		Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	has a wide and expectant au - dience .

		His new book , entitled '' Christianity and Social Problems , '' presents a collection of various articles and sermons that have previously appeared separately ; discourses on the social ideals of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , with applications to domestic , industrial , international , and penological problems .

		The dis - cussion is stimulating , and good use is made of excel - lent authorities .

		The quotation of the census figures on crime-increase -LRB- p. 299 -RRB- should have been accom - panied by Dr. Wines 's protest against their value .

		It was well worth while to print in one volume the addresses delivered before the
American Con	ORGANIZATION	- ference on
International Arbitration	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most essential elements of the question are discussed by such eminent men as Mr.
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward Atkinson	PERSON	, President
Angell	PERSON	, and other specialists in international law and political ethics .

		Minor differ - ences are expressed with frankness by men who agree on the main issue , the determination of inter - national disputes by judicial process rather than by the brute force of war .

		The documents in the ap - pendix , arranged by Professor
J. B. Moore	PERSON	, are very valuable . ''

		Immigration Fallacies '' deals with the evils of too rapid invasion of European immigrants .

		The arguments are based on the observations of an intel - ligent reader of current events , rather than upon exhaustive statistical analyses .

		A good point is made in the chapter on European responsibility for crimes committed by foreigners in this country .

		The treat - ment is too brief to be exhaustive .


C. R. HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The story of Publishers and authors , as well as the American the reading public , are gradually he - mine and miner .

		com i ng aware that the history of the American people does not altogether lie in lists of wars , of battles , and of statesmen , nor between the lids of the '' Congressional Record , '' but that the attrition of concurrent streams of races , inventive genius under the stimulus of new surroundings , the evolution of means of transportation , and the devel - opment of material resources , must be studied and their facts recorded .

		These will be found to under - lie much that has been accepted as the sum total of American history .

		Such investigation is especially necessary and timely in that rapidly shifting pano - rama commonly known as '' the West . ''

		The types developed in the progress of civilization across the continent are fast disappearing , but it is some con - solation to know that they are to be preserved in print in `` The Story of the West Series , '' planned for this purpose under the capable editorship of Mr.
Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The initial volume of the series was devoted to '' The Story of the American In - dian , '' and the second is given to '' The Story of the Mine . ''

		The important duty of telling '' The Story of the Mine '' was entrusted to the competent hands of Mr.
Charles Howard Shinn	PERSON	, and he has told it in precisely the manner which his prior ex - cellent writings upon Western topics would prom - ise .

		Confronted by the vast amount of material before him , he wisely confined himself in the main to the story of the typical
Comstock Lode of Ne	ORGANIZATION	- vada , with side chapters on mine litigation , the min - ing community , stock speculation , and mining prob - lems with their mechanical solutions .

		The concluding chapters on mining and the miner of to-day con - tinue the interest of the story to the present time .

		Readers hitherto have lacked neither statistics of mines and mining , nor technical descriptions of ma - chinery employed ; neither has there been wanting a portraiture of mining camp-life by American au - thors .

		But Mr.
Shinn	PERSON	has drawn equally from all sources , and has produced a new alloy upon which he has stamped the picturesque images of the pros - pector , the exploiteur , the miner , the speculator , the parvenue millionaire , and the camp-follower .

		He chooses to err on the side of the romantic rather than the technical ; to intersperse his facts with glimpses of the life which gave rise to the facts ; to toss out his English in bits of native metal , instead of fastidiously arranging his sentences in regular piles of bullion bars .

		But the style is felt to be suited to the rugged life it portrays .

		The interested reader joins the mad crowd in one of the many '' rushes '' for a new field ; he studies the '' indica - tions '' of the Let-Her-Rip , '' the '' Last Chance , '' or the '' Gouge-Eye '' ; he mutters his imprecations at the demand of the broker for '' more mud , '' and he goes '' Bonanza '' or '' Borrusca , '' as his luck may be .

		The book will appeal to readers who have
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 seen something of the regions or the life it so viv - idly portrays , as well as to those who seek clear information concerning the most important factor in the development of the Western half of the great American continent .

		In Professor
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	's '' Stud - The interpretation j eg in Interpretation '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , the of literature .

		, \ \ '' student of literature will find as good criticism as has appeared , in
America	LOCATION	at least , for some time .

		The essays will be most interesting to those who really desire to know something about
Keats	PERSON	,
Clough	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; as to how they will impress others , there may be doubt .

		But al - though thoughtful , they are not scholastic in char - acter , and , we should think , would appeal to a con - siderable audience .

		We consider the results sound and well put : the essay on
Keats	PERSON	will probably be more useful in helping one to
Keats	PERSON	's poetry than anything else published ;
Clough	PERSON	needs no introduc - tion to some of his work and no introduction can revive the rest , so that the estimate of
Clough	PERSON	is more for general reading ; the essay on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	will be of value to the reader of his poetry and prose alike .

		We approve of all the book but the title , and as the title is carefully chosen , and seems from the preface to be representative of the author , we see that we differ from him .

		These essays '' are intended to be , within the strict mean - ing of the title chosen for them , studies in inter - pretation . ''

		Interpretation of what ?

		is the question .

		If Professor
Hudson	PERSON	thinks he is interpreting the poetry of these poets , we conceive him to be wrong .

		If he means thas he is interpreting the characters of the poets , he is right , except that '' to interpret a character '' is not a common use of language .

		To interpret is to give the hidden meaning of any ex - pression .

		Now a character is hardly an expression ; a poem is an expression , but not a poet .

		So one may interpret a poem , but a poet is not , strictly speaking , to be interpreted .

		It must further be re - marked that to present the character of a poet is not to interpret his poetry ; it only furnishes bases for interpretation .

		The character , or more accu - rately the spirit , of the poet is not the poem , and to analyze the spirit of the poet is not to interpret the poem .

		These essays are on the men , not on their works .

		Doubtless , however , Professor
Hudson	PERSON	had all this in mind ; he puzzles us a little by saying that his point of view is not commonly adopted by students of modern poetry .

		Now we should say that the error of confusing an analysis of a poet 's char - acter with an interpretation of his work was the com - monest error alive to-day in the academic teaching of English literature .

		It is then probable that the difference between Professor
Hudson	PERSON	's standpoint and that not so uncommon at present is that he knows what he is doing , while the others do not .

		Read with an understanding of their true bearing , these essays will be found admirable .

		The one on
Keats	PERSON	, as we have said , we think the best .

		We re - gret that Professor
Hudson	PERSON	was unwilling to specu - late farther upon what
Keats	PERSON	might have become , or rather that he did not bring out an element of the poet 's life and poetry which never came to com - plete development , through his early death .

		We think it needed to give an adequate view of the poet .

		But , as it is , the leading points are picked out with great skill and are well presented .


M. Gaston Boissier	PERSON	is so delightful a An unwelcome wr it er that a good translation of any translation .

		P , , , , .

		, , of his works would certainly find a welcome among English readers .

		But that does not mean that the translation of '' Rome and
Pompeii	LOCATION	, '' now before us , will find a welcome .

		The readers of such a volume are naturally persons of more or less classical culture , and such persons can not enjoy a translation honeycombed with errors at the very points where classical culture should make itself manifest .

		One reaches but the fifth page to find the Via
Nomentana	PERSON	disguised as
Nomentata	LOCATION	; the ninth -LRB- and many others -RRB- transfers the French form
Denys	PERSON	into English for Dionysius of
Halicarnassus	LOCATION	; and in like manner we find Sllves for Silvse , Dios - cures for Dioscuri , Pastes for Fasti , Celse for Cel - sus , Pollion for
Pollio	PERSON	, and Aulu Gelle for Aulus Gellius .

		Another numerous group of errors is rep - resented by Claudienus for Claudianus , Pomporius for Pomponius , Catullus for Catulus , Frono for Fronto , and even Haceus for Flaccus .

		Padre Bruzzi ,
Padre Bruzza	LOCATION	, and Father Bruzza are different designations for the same individual .

		The great rival of Cicero appears as the poet
Hortensius	PERSON	, and the Phsedrus of Plato as the
Phcedra	LOCATION	.

		The reader may have his choice between
St. Maria Mag	ORGANIZATION	- giore and
St. Santa Maria Maggiore	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turtullian , the Pathagoricians , and the son of Atrseus form a fine group for an intelligent man to contemplate ; and but why go any farther ?

		We are almost ready to recommend this as a supplement to the many '' Do n't '' books placed on the market within the last few years .

		It is extremely unfortunate that
M. Boissier	PERSON	should have such a blundering introduc - tion to the English and American reader .

		The book bears the imprint of the Putnam press , and Mr.
D. Havelock Fisher	PERSON	is the translator .

		In the novel that is read to-day and forgotten to-morrow , the ignorant translator may be tolerated ; but when he lays his hands upon a work of scholarship , it is time for an indignant protest .

		_ .

		Mr.
Joseph Edgar Chamberlin	PERSON	's u The Listener in the Town '' and '' The Listener in the Country '' -LRB-
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are additions to the number of bindings now in existence , but not to the number of books .

		The contents , little essays and bits of obser - vation , were well enough as newspaper literature -LRB- they originally appeared in the ''
Boston	LOCATION	Tran - script '' -RRB- , but they do not make real literature .

		Not that there is no merit in the contents ; there is a good deal that shows sympathy with the varied forms of city life and true affection for the charms of the
2 %	PERCENT	modem 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, country .

		But it is all very commonplace ; there is hardly a spark of individuality .

		The truth is that this generation has been so trained that by this time one person out of every ten has fallen into the habit of observing a city crowd with the desire to find something that will appeal to the heart , or of roam - ing about in any half-countrified spot with true de - light in the song of birds or the silence of the trees .

		So the reader of Mr.
Chamberlin	PERSON	's book will read sentence after sentence and say , '' Well , I could have said that myself if I 'd wanted to . ''

		With real books on nature say by
Gilbert White	PERSON	or
Jeffries	PERSON	, by
Thoreau	PERSON	or Burroughs one never feels in that way , because almost every sentence has something new and fine in it , and gives that feeling of libera - tion of spirit that genius can somehow manage to effect .

		So with real books of sympathetic observa - tion of men and things : the list is not so easy to make , but we might say books by
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, or
Thackeray	PERSON	, or
George William Curtis	PERSON	.

		We do not think we could ourselves say such things as they say , because we know we could not .

		Every sentence we enjoy , because it is of a higher power , which for a moment we appropriate .

		Mr.
Chamberlin	PERSON	's obser - vations we acknowledge for the instant , and then forget , just as we forget the thousand-and-one obser - vations we make ourselves between
morning and night	TIME	, because there is no reason why we should remember them .

		Such work appears in large quantities in the papers nowadays , and that is well enough , for so many persons read the papers who know no better literature ; the real power of litera - ture filters down to them through such columns as '' The Listener '' in '' The Transcript . ''

		But there is no reason for republishing such articles , unless the author will confine them to his friends .

		From the above strictures must be excepted the three papers on
Mountains	LOCATION	.

		Mountains have apparently the power to sting Mr.
Chamberlin	PERSON	into moments of genuine and individual expression ; they get his key - note .

		There is a game which grown-up peo - Haecfabuia le Some ti m e 8 play with children , non docet .

		.

		i i .

		called '' pictorial proverbs , in which each person presents a well-known proverb in the form of a picture .

		The object of the game is to guess the proverb that each picture ostensibly illustrates .

		The pictures are often such that the proverb is ob - scured rather than illustrated ; but however difficult , the guessing is rendered more easy by the fact that the moral truth indicated by each picture is usually well-known .

		Those who have suffered under this game can imagine what a torment it might become , if one were allowed to illustrate any moral idea that occurred to him .

		The pictures would then become enigmas , and the offence given by not probing the intention of the youthful artists would render one 's efforts doubly painful .

		Like this game is the vol - ume of
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Fables '' just published -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- .

		We want to like everything
Stevenson	PERSON	has written ; and , indeed , we feel that we ought to do so .

		But it is sometimes amazingly difficult to see the moral implied in these strange tales of his .

		They are generally interesting in themselves ; the inci - dents are conceived with the ingenuity of the story - teller , the figures are created by a true imagination , for instance , the phantom which gobbled at the boy like a turkey , and on being struck down gave up its life as a little bloodless white thing , is very fine in its way , as is also the crone on the dreary beach who danced widdershins in the dusk .

		But as to the meaning .

		It should be remarked , how - ever , that a number of the fables are simple enough in expression and symbolism .

		We have generally regarded such simplicity as characteristic of the fable as a literary form .


Stevenson	PERSON	, however , took the term in an extended meaning ; a number of his longer fables are more what one would incline to call allegories or allegorical tales .

		As to these , one is likely to feel like the
Earl	LOCATION	in the nineteenth fable , who said , '' There is no sense in any of this , and I must be growing old . ''

		Still , although enig - matic , these fables have a fascination ; one reads them willingly a second time .

		Finally , one begins to construct from them a theory of life , and to won - der whether it were
Stevenson	PERSON	's .

		To distil such a theory and offer it to the public is the true duty of the critic of this book .

		This he should do , and not merely gird at his author for alleged obscurity .

		The study of literature as a criticism of life would seem to demand some analysis of literature in general on the basis of the facts of life .

		We ought to have lit - erature considered according to the necessities of a historical or a biographical or a rhetorical stand - point , and also from the standpoint of one who be - lieves that in literature he will come to an under - standing , or at least a criticism , of life as it really is .

		Unable , however , to grasp the whole matter at once , he asks some arrangements that may correlate the two .

		Suppose , as
Ruskin	PERSON	suggests , we ask for Shake - speare 's opinion on the matter of Church authority .

		How are we to get it ?

		Looking at literature from the standpoint of life , we do not care particularly for history , biography , rhetoric , and their divisions are not to our purpose .

		We know of certain ele - ments of life , certain facts or questions of life , and to such system as we may have of these facts or elements we want to accommodate our gain from literature .

		Some such ideas as these serve to show how '' The Vision of Christ in the Poets '' -LRB- edited by Mr.
C. M. Stuart	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has a value beyond other collections of religious poetry .

		Christ is a great fact in life .

		Has literature anything to say whereby we shall realise that fact the better ?

		The book in question is not a study nor a treatise ; indeed , it falls short in many particulars of what it might be ; but there is so little else of the sort that many people will like to see it .

		It is made up of extracts from eight poets of our own century , and also from
Milton	LOCATION	, with some slight comment and explanation .

		THE DIAL 261 Dr.
C. C. Abbott	PERSON	's recent volume of Pleasant talks `` Bird-Land Echoes '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- about birds .

		adds to the author s repute as a ten - der lover of nature and a vivid narrator of his ex - periences in his studies of animal life in the woods and fields .

		His discourse is like the free , frank , informal talk held by the camp-fire or the glowing hearth at evening-time , when the day 's work is done and there is leisure for idle and happy reminiscence .

		Still , there is method in his '' Bird-Land Echoes , '' each separate chapter treating of some special group of birds , the members of which follow each other in a sort of haphazard order as they chance to come before the mental vision , or as they would chance to appear in an actual walk amid their native haunts .

		One feels in reading the book as though in the very presence of the author , who in an amiably voluble mood speaks of all the trifling occurrences connected with his theme , giving now an interesting fact that is worth treasuring , and now a mere opinion or ex - pression of feeling uttered in emphatic words that are striking and amusing .

		One is grateful for the frequent outbursts of indignation at the slaughter of our birds for the decoration of women 's hats and the gratification of the hunter .

		We can not boast of our civilization , our humanity even , until we learn to respect the life of the meanest thing that breathes .

		The illustrations enlivening Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's book are evidently copies of stuffed birds , and are not always as true to life as they should be .

		Most of the bird - figures are puffed out in the breast in a sadly un - natural way .

		Mr.
Thomas S. Blair	PERSON	, author of the The quest for work ent i t i e -LRB- j Human Progress : human progress .

		^ _ , What can Man do to Further It ? ''

		-LRB-
William R. Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- starts out to discover a work - ing hypothesis which shall rightly answer the ques - tion , What can man do to further man 's progress ?

		and finding that the methods of the philosopher have proved inadequate , he adopts , experimentally , the methods of the business-man .

		He informs the reader at the outset that there is no attempt in his work to present a dogmatic exposition of positive doc - trine , but that every statement is to be understood as hypothetical only .

		He proceeds on certain as - sumed facts which are satisfactory to himself , and works out a system of prescripts of national policy which he believes will add to the sum of human progress and prosperity .

		His methods of reasoning are almost too involved and obscure to attract the interest of the average reader , and it is hence doubt - ful if he succeeds in arousing that action which his thought and evident sincerity ought to awaken .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	reproduces his volume of '' Science Sketches '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , having replaced some of the rods of the fascia with sticks of a later gathering .

		Whether he describes the life of a salmon or a '' johnny darter , '' or shows how trout understand multiplication and division , and how they have flanked the unscalable precipices of the
Great Divide	ORGANIZATION	, explains the deep-set furnaces that keep the Yellowstone gushers in hot water , or tells how he marched up the peak of the Matterhorn and then marched down again , defends the idiosyncracies of Rafinesque or pays devout homage to
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, or presents an allegoric vision of the monstrosities of pro- tection as discovered from an ideal and isolated point of view , Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	is always original and instructive , and sometimes he is amusing as well .

		A monograph upon the White Pine ,
Pinus Strobus	PERSON	, the most important lumber - producing tree of
North America	LOCATION	, by
Gifford Pinchott	ORGANIZATION	and
Harry S. Graves	PERSON	, treats the subject upon its economic side in a method at once complete and concise .

		It discusses the conditions under which the tree thrives , the evils which threaten it , the prospect of its reproduction upon suitable areas ; and shows by tables and diagrams , condensed from a multitude of observations , the amounts of merchantable material , either squared timber or sawn lumber , which may be secured from single trees or from measured areas of land , with the rates of increase at different stages in the growth of the forest .

McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the pretty title given to a pretty book of selections from the writings of '' Amber , '' the pen-name by which the late Mrs.
Martha Holden	PERSON	was long known to
Chicago	LOCATION	news - paper readers .

		Mrs.
Holden	PERSON	had a happy knack of evolving bits of philosophy or of fun out of the most commonplace circumstances or happenings , and , by her own confession , '' simply adored the open sky , a tree in bloom , and a pretty woman . ''

		A wise discrimination has been exercised in making these selections ; some pleasant and graceful verses are scattered among the prose ; and there is a brief preface by Mr.
Opie	PERSON	Read .

		The ''
Oxford Teacher	ORGANIZATION	's Bible , '' published at the Uni - versity Press by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, is a triumph of compact and beautiful book-making .

		Printed upon the famous
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , it gives us within the com - pass of a single octavo volume of moderate size some - thing like two thousand pages of text and plates .

		Three distinct works are here bound together : the Scriptures themselves , '' Bible Illustrations , '' and '' Helps to the Study of the Bible . ''

		The '' Illustrations '' are a series of plates illustrating Biblical versions and antiquities , while the '' Helps '' comprise summaries , notes , tables , indexes , a concordance , and a set of maps .

		The text is that of the authorized version , with frequent reference to the revised version completed in
1885	DATE	.

		The whole is bound in flexible morocco , and makes up a volume so nearly perfect in every way that it would be difficult to suggest improvements .

		Another remarkable book made possible by the use of the
India	LOCATION	paper is the '' Ox - ford
Byron	PERSON	, '' a rather thin volume of over nine hun - dred double-columned pages , containing the complete works of the poet .

		Mr.
John W. Tufts	PERSON	is the author of '' A Handbook of Vocal Music '' for use in the public schools , although designed for teachers rather than for pupils .

		The work is the outcome of many years of pedagogic experience , and is very completely adapted for its avowed purpose .

		The claim is not too great that '' it will give teachers who are obliged to work without supervision much of the inspiration and help that they must otherwise lack . ''

		We may also mention in this connection Mr.
C. W. Johnson	PERSON	's '' Songs of the Nation , '' a collection of pa - triotic , occasional , college , and devotional songs .

		A brief reflection may serve to suggest that these dramas , starting from the same standpoint , and resembling each other 's plot and evolu - tion so closely , must needs possess matter of exceeding interest for all thinkers and schools of thought .

		First , they prove that the problems and difficulties with which men have coped through all time are essen - tially the same Prometheus in opposition to the Olympian Deities ; the Patriarch Job in antagonism to the Hebrew Jahve ;
Faust	PERSON	and the wonder-working magician contending with the Deity of the modern world , and with the laws by which he endeavors to rule it all are vin - dicators of the self-same issue , protogenists in the self-same battle .

		They occupy the same standpoint of inherent justice and of automatic mental independence , of self-determining reasoning and conscience ; they commence from the self - same starting point ; they employ largely the same arguments ; they arrive mostly at the same conclusions . ''

		293 THE FUTURE OF ENGLISH SPELLING .

		Agitation for a reform of English spelling has been going on for a long while , both in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, but the reform - ers have received slight encouragement from the public .

		The empirical reconstruction urged by
Webster	PERSON	has given place to the more scien - tific conceptions of modern philology ; but all the reformers , men of science and empiricists alike , have made no serious breach in the de - fences of conservatism .

		Every form of argu - ment , from plea to denunciation , has been en - listed in the attack , but the citadel has remained impregnable .

		Even
Webster	PERSON	's '' Dictionary '' has grown conservative in its old age , and bears but few traces of the fiery radicalism of its youth .

		The little systems of the phonetists have had their day , each in its turn arousing the public to momentary mirth or wonder , and then giving place to another no less grotesque and impossible .

		The legislature of the nation and the school authorities of the locality have been petitioned and memorialized and appealed to in the most frantically misspelled terms , and have remained obdurate .

		The publisher here and the editor there , who , impatient of delay , have allowed zeal to outrun judgment , and have sought to force a reformed spelling upon the reluctant public , have had only their labor for their pains , and made for themselves the old discovery that man is not a logical ani - mal .

		Judging by the almost total failure of the English spelling-reformer to accomplish his purpose , we may with peculiar fitness apply to him the words of the poet : '' He weaves , and is clothed with derision ; Sows , and he shall not reap . ''

		The net result of all his efforts in the
United States	LOCATION	is summed up in the few Websterian forms that have found a lodgment in usage -LRB- many of these abhorrent to a delicate sense -RRB- , in the adoption of a few other simplified forms by scattered publishers , and in the tentative admission to some of our later dictionaries of an appendix of amended spellings .

		In the face of this persistent opposition to a change which has been advocated by so many able scholars and supported by so many plaus - ible arguments , it is worth while to inquire into 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the causes of what spelling-reformers have too hastily assumed to be mere obstinacy or unrea - soning prejudice .

		The time is past for them to say with Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	that '' there is certainly nothing more contemptible than our present spelling , unless it be the reasons usually given for clinging to it , '' or with Professor Whit - ney that '' it need not be said that the objec - tions brought on etymological and literary and other grounds against the correction of English spelling are the unthinking expressions of igno - rance and prejudice . ''

		If these statements were true , the reformers would have something sub - stantial to show for their long-continued efforts , and the fact is notorious that they have almost nothing to show for them .

		When we come to think of it , the wholesale ascription of '' igno - rance and prejudice '' to the many men who have opposed the spelling-mongers is a weapon more likely than not to recoil upon those who use it as an argument ; while '' contemptible '' is about as ill-fitting an epithet as could be found , whether to describe the conservative po - sition itself , or the spelling which is the pri - mary object of attack .

		Our English spelling may be irrational , and inconsistent , and diffi - cult of mastery , but it is just as much a natural product as is a tree or a wild animal .

		One may prefer the order and symmetry of a French garden to a free woodland growth ; but he who has a nice feeling for the meaning of words does not call the forest oak contemptible be - cause it is gnarled .

		A recent article in '' The Forum , '' by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	, the editor of '' The Cen - tury Dictionary , '' quotes with seeming approval the above dicta of Professors
Lounsbury	PERSON	and
Whitney	LOCATION	, but proceeds to discuss the subject in a very different spirit .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is a pro- nounced advocate of spelling-reform , but he reckons with the arguments of his opponents instead of brushing them aside as unworthy of serious consideration .

		The conservative could ask for no better statement than the following of the reason that chiefly influences him in op - posing any radical change .

		This reason is '' the closely-knit association , in all minds , between the form of the printed word , or of the printed page , and the spiritual atmosphere which breathes through our language and literature .

		There is a deep-rooted feeling that the existing printed form is not only a symbol but the most fitting symbol of our mother tongue , and that a radical change in this symbol must inevitably impair for us the beauty and spiritual effectiveness of that which it symbolizes .

		Could the literary spirit even of a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we feel , retain for us undiminished its delicacy and power if clothed in the spelling of the
Fonetic Nuz	ORGANIZATION	' ? ''

		The feeling thus expressed is akin to that which makes us enjoy literature far more in the pages of a comely and carefully-studied volume than we could enjoy the same work in some cheap and tasteless reprint .

		It is the same sort of feeling that heightens for all readers of taste the power of literature when it appeals to them from the pages of a Conquet edition , or a pub - lication of the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	, or an issue of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is useless to call such feel - ings irrational , or to make light of them as arguments against a change ; they exist , and they exert a controlling influence upon the de - cisions of the majority of intelligent readers .

		Those who can not share them , and allow them their full weight in the discussion , are as incom - petent to pronounce judgment upon the ques - tion of spelling-reform as are the color-blind to pronounce upon Venetian painting , or those without an ear for music to pass upon the achievements of Bach and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		This of course is only one of the reasons for which a wholesale change in our spelling is opposed by so many earnest thinkers .

		There are other weighty considerations , such as the danger of making the great mass of printed literature in the least degree difficult of access for the average reader ; and the danger of ob - scuring etymologies , of which too much has doubtless been made , but which remains a real danger in spite of the many efforts to minim - ize it .

		We must also remember that the argu - ments made in behalf of reform are often greatly overstated .

		We are given the wildest estimates of the amount of money that might be saved in our printing bills , of the number of years that might be saved in the work of primary education , of the obstacles that might be removed from the path of foreign students of our language .

		All of these arguments have weight , but they do not have anything like the weight given them by phonetic extremists .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, who is not an extremist , discusses the whole question with the utmost fairness , admits that spelling-reform '' has made almost no head - way at all , '' concedes '' that the adoption by the public of any general , radical , phonetic system is one of the most improbable things that can be imagined , '' and declares that the only practical thing for the reformers to at - tempt is a series of gradual modifications in the language stimulating by conscious effort the sort of transformation that has been work -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 ing itself out instinctively during the past three centuries .

		If spelling-reformers in general would adopt this moderate position , there would be little serious disagreement among thinking men .

		Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	, speaking of
Webster	PERSON	's unsuccessful effort to create a new language '' made in
America	LOCATION	, '' justly says : '' Language is not a toy or a patent machine , which can be broken , thrown aside at will , and replaced with a better tool , ready-made from the lexicog - rapher 's shop .

		He had no conception of the enormous weight of the English language and literature , when he undertook to shovel it out of the path of American civilization .

		The stars in their courses fought against him . ''

		It may safely be said that English spelling will con - tinue to undergo the sort of modification in the direction of rationality that has marked its de - velopment in the past , and at a probably accel - erated rate .

		And it may be said with equal safety that no other sort of change is possible .

		It is our own opinion that no other sort of change is , all things considered , desirable , and that each simplified spelling proposed must be judged upon its own merits , submitting to a test in which feeling and instinct are given as much weight as logic , before it shall receive perma - nent acceptance in our speech . ''

		There are , '' to quote from Mr.
Smith	PERSON	once more , '' in the variations of our existing orthography allowed by the dictionaries and in the occasional inno - vations of influential writers which are accepted by the public without .

		any jarring of the nerves , the beginnings of a movement which , if contin - tinued along its own lines and gradually pushed to a consistent conclusion , will result in a vast simplification and rationalizing of our lan - guage . ''

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At the moment when the effort is being made to estab - lish the teaching of English Literature in American universities , it may be of interest to consider the teach - ing of the same subject in the German universities , where for the
last quarter-century	DATE	or more so many American teachers of English have received their train - ing and their methods .

		I have before me the general catalogue of the lectures in all the German universities for the coming winter semester , which has recently been published in
Munich	LOCATION	.

		In twenty-eight German universities -LRB- in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Switzerland	LOCATION	-RRB- where courses in English philology are given , I find that out of a total of ninety-six courses , not including courses for beginners in modern English , some twenty-five courses , requiring some fifty-six hours per week , are exclusively linguistic .

		Representative titles under this head are Professor
Wiilker	PERSON	's course at Leipsic on '' The Historical Grammar of English '' and Professor Sar - razin 's course at
Kiel	ORGANIZATION	on '' The History of the English Language . ''

		Of courses in Old English there are nine - teen requiring thirty-eight hours ; and in
Middle English	LOCATION	-LRB- exclusively -RRB- there are eight -LRB- sixteen hours -RRB- .

		Most of these are introductory courses , and are also largely linguistic .

		Burns has two courses and Byron two .

		Professor
Brandl	PERSON	, who has recently taken up arms for
Byron	PERSON	in the pages of ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, '' makes
Byron	PERSON	the starting-point for his treatment of nineteenth century literature .

		Under the head of mis - cellaneous , I place two courses on English metrics -LRB- Pro- fessors
Kaluza	PERSON	and
Wagner	PERSON	-RRB- , Professor
Vetter	PERSON	's course on the English Volkslied , and Professor
Victor	PERSON	's '' Meth - odik des Unterrichts im Englischen . ''

		Summarizing , accordingly , of courses not exclusively linguistic I find that there are twenty-five treating En - glish literature before the sixteenth century , sixteen on Shakespeare and the Elizabethans , and fourteen on eighteenth and nineteenth century authors .

		Further - more , it is to be noticed that while many of the courses on linguistics and several of those covering the earlier period in literature are of an advanced and highly spe - cialized nature , the same can be said of very few of the courses on the later periods .

		The unavoidable inference is that the literary study of English literature is but little attempted in the German universities .

		In the last few years , however , I am informed , the demand for 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, courses permitting such study , on the part of American students in
Germany	LOCATION	, has in some quarters begun to make itself felt .

		One hears that such-and-such pro- fessors do not neglect the literary side of their subjects , and that consequently their courses are more and more frequented by Americans .

		Doubtless we have still much to learn from German culture and methods in the study and appreciation of our own literatures , as we have from French .

		Who can say that the insistence of French and German critics in time will not force us to revise our obdurate estimate of Byron ?

		In most respects , however , it is plain that the forte of German scholarship is in the treatment of Old and Middle English .

		The text-books and the cur - rent histories of literature at any given period usually reflect the prevailing taste and criticism of the time .

		If we leave aside the case of
Byron	PERSON	, is there any last pos - sibility that we will ever be brought to accept the current German evaluation of modern English authors , as it is reflected in their histories of English literature ?

		The last part of Professor
Wiilker	PERSON	's new popular '' Geschichte der
Englischen Litteratnr	PERSON	von den
Aeltesten Zeiten	PERSON	bis zur Gegenwart '' has just this month appeared , and I turn to his pages to discover his method of treatment for the modern period .

		The apportionment of chapters for the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries seems to be just and fairly comprehensive .

		The
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan period receives five chapters ; the period of the
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	and the Restoration , two ; and the
first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	, four .

		The titles of the re - maining chapters are as follows : The Movement against the Art - School in Poetry ;
Walter Scott	PERSON	; The Lake School ;
Thomas Moore	PERSON	;
Byron	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	; The Age of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.


Thomas Moore	PERSON	exalted to a sepa - rate chapter , while
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Southey	PERSON	are collectively hidden under the traditional appellation of '' The Lake School '' !

		I find the same lack of literary perspective exemplified in a representative university reference book in the same field , the '' Grundriss der Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur '' by Dr.
Gustav Korting	PERSON	, professor at
Kiel	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this work eleven pages are devoted to
Byron	PERSON	, four to
Moore	PERSON	, and three to
Wordsworth	PERSON	!

		The sesthetic judgments are generally to match .

		I quote from Professor Korting 's pages : '' The greatest of the three poets -LSB- of the
Lake School	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- is the highly talented
Coleridge	PERSON	;
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	never rose above a respectable mediocrity . ''

		`` In
England Wordsworth	LOCATION	is more favorably judged .

		The reason for this in some measure may be that Words - worth through his excellences as through his defects is in the highest degree a poet comprehensible to all , and , more than this , a poet who has had the peculiar gift , as few others have had , of giving expression to specifically English thoughts and feelings . '' ''

		It may be asserted -LSB- of
Moore	PERSON	's lyrics -RSB- that they are the noblest productions of the modern English Art-lyric . '' ''

		A poet may pos - sess all the qualities which grace the verse of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and still be a poet of only the second or third rank .

		Tennyson is one of the most attractive of poets , but he is not a great poet .

		He lacks originality and genius .

		The form of his poetry ... is much more significant than its contents , which for the most part does not rise above mediocrity , and frequently not even above triv - iality , using the last word in its best sense .

		Tennyson 's poems , if written in prose , would be void of every attrac - tion ; it was with good reason that he never made use of prose '' !

		It is hardly from the negative that our help will come , and it seems as though the attitude of academic Ger - many towards modern English literature were negative and scholastic rather than interpretative and illumina - tive .

		A MISPLACED `` BEER KEG . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Let me call attention to an amusing error made by the reviewer of '' Colonial Days in Old
New York	LOCATION	, '' in the last issue of THE DIAL .

		Speaking of the cover of the book , the reviewer says that it is '' decorated with suggestive windmill , beaver , and beer keg , '' Those who have pursued Dutch
New York	LOCATION	history beyond Irving 's humorous libel know that the design on Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's book is a copy of the seal of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, adopted in
1686	DATE	.

		The flour industry of New Nether - lands and early
New York	LOCATION	out-rivalled that of the ex - portation of furs , and in consequence the arms of the windmill , and & flour barrel , were added to the beaver on the seal of the .

		city , as emblems of its industry and commerce .

		It is the flour barrel , and not the beer keg , which is most truly '' suggestive '' of Dutch development in this country .

		BIRD ILLUSTRATIONS FROM LIFE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am truly grateful for the kindly notice of the text of my '' Birdland Echoes '' in your last issue .

		But in justice to Mr.
Crane	PERSON	, the illustrator , I must say that the strictures on his part of the work are not justified by the facts .

		Instead of the illustrations being '' copies of stuffed birds , '' every bird was drawn from life , and after long study ; and the appearance of being '' puffed out in the breast '' is really true to nature .

		The truth is , we have too much in mind the trim , smooth-feathered birds of the average illustration .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's drawings I claim are the best i. e. , the most correct black-and - white illustrations ever published ; so correct , indeed , they do not call for color , if used as a means of identify - ing any bird in hand .

		HAMERTON 'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's Autobiography -LRB- 1834-58 -RRB- fills about one-third of a rather substantial vol - ume , and tells the story of the writer 's life up to his twenty-fourth year .

		Fortunately , as it happens , this year was the date of his marriage ; so that Mrs.
Hamerton	PERSON	, in the Memoir by which she has supplemented her husband 's too-brief sketch , is enabled to take up the thread of the narrative at the point where he dropped it .

		The volume thus forms a complete and contin - uous life of a man to whom
America	LOCATION	owes much both of profit and pleasure .

		We venture to say -LRB- `` with all deference to the fine rhapsodies of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	-RRB- that Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's books have done more than those of any other writer to spread in this country a taste for sound art and an insight into its principles .

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	was born at
Laneside	LOCATION	, near
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Lancashire	LOCATION	, in
1834	DATE	.

		His family on both sides seems to have been of the upper middle class , with aristocratic connections and leanings .

		Of his father -LRB- an attorney in fair practice -RRB- he says : '' He had very little to recommend him except a fine person , great physical strength , and fifteen quarterings .

		He had a reputation for dissolute habits , was a good horseman , an excellent shot , looked very well in a ball - room , and these , I believe , were all his advantages , save an unhappy faculty for shining in such masculine com - pany as he could find in a
Lancashire	LOCATION	village in the days of George IV .

		Money he had none , except what he earned in his profession , at one time rather a good in - come . ''

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's mother died a little over a year after her marriage . ''

		Few people , '' her son says , '' who have lived in the world have left such slight traces . ''

		Her loss was a heavy blow to her husband , who , despite his rough nature and hard-riding hard-drinking procliv - ities , loved her devotedly .

		He thenceforth neg - lected his profession , separated himself more and more from his social class , , and sank grad - ually into a slough of mere village conviviality : '' He and his friends drank when they were together to make society merrier , and when they happened to be alone they drank to make solitude endurable They dined at mid-day , and had the spirit decanter and the tobacco-box on the table instead of desert , frequently drinking through the whole afternoon and a long even - ing afterwards .

		In the morning they slaked alcoholic thirst with copious draughts of ale . ''

		An Autobiography ,
1834	DATE	-
1858	DATE	, and a Memoir by his Wife , 1858-1894 .

		With portrait .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fortunately , our future author and etcher was not brought up mainly under the roof of this graceless father else he might well have lapsed into a mere rustic scapegrace of the ''
Tony Lumpkin	PERSON	'' order , or worse .

		Much of his childhood was passed with two maiden aunts at
Burnley	LOCATION	; and he says , '' I could not have been better cared for by my own mother than by these two excellent ladies . ''

		At Burn - ley he learned to read English with ease , and attended the
Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	, where he was at once '' set at Latin '' unfortunately , after a method so ingeniously difficult and repulsive as to breed in him a '' horror of everything printed in Latin '' that was scarcely overcome in later years .

		The Burnley period is followed by a dark chapter in Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's life so dark , he says , that the necessity of writing it has made him '' put off the composition of this autobiography year after year . ''

		Into the ex - tremely painful details of this chapter we need not go .

		Suffice it to say that in
1843	DATE	Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	, then a sensitive boy of nine years or so , was taken to live alone with his father at
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	; and that while there , during a period of six months , he was treated by him with a cruelty which it is charitable to ascribe to mental dis - order brought on by long addiction to the brandy bottle .

		During this half-year , existence was a hell to him ; and his system was fast giv - ing way under the constant strain of the alter - nate dread of blows and their actual reception , and torments even worse than blows , when the end came , swift , tragic , yet not wholly unwel - come .

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	thus describes it : `` I awoke one bleak winter 's morning about five o'clock , and heard the strangest cries proceeding from his room .

		His man-servant had been awakened before me and had gone to the room already , where he was engaged in a sort of wrestling match with my father , who , in the belief that the house was full of enemies , was endeavoring to throw himself out of the window .

		Other men had been called for , who speedily arrived , and they overpowered him , though even the remnant of his mighty strength was such that it took six men to hold him on his bed .

		... I was not in the room when he died , but my aunt took me to see him immediately after , and then I received an impression which has lasted to the present day . ''

		The week that preceded the death of the elder
Hamilton	PERSON	was one of terror for the for - lorn and bewildered boy ; but it had a blessed interlude that came like a sign and a dawning of the brighter time to come .

		Of this incident Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	says : '' I had been able to get to sleep that night for a short time , when a light in the room woke me .

		The horrible life I had been leading for many a day and night had produced a great impressionability , and I was particu - 578 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, larly afraid of my father in the night-time , so I started up in bed with the idea that he was come to beat me , when lo !

		instead of his terrible face , I saw what was forme the sweetest and dearest face in the whole world !

		It was his sister
Mary	PERSON	, she who had taken my mother 's place , and whom I loved with a mingled sentiment of filial tenderness and gratitude that remained undimin - ished in force during all the after years .

		For the sud - denness of revulsion from horror to happiness , there has never been a minute in my existence comparable to the minute when I realized that she had come . ''

		In his father 's will the sister Mary of the foregoing incident was named as Mr.
Hamer	PERSON	- ton 's sole guardian .

		Her general life-scheme for him was the socially irreproachable one comprising a
Public School	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, the Church ; but , says Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	, '' there was a vis inertice in my total want of social and scholastic ambition .

		In the worldly sense I never had any ambition whatever . ''

		The idea of Rugby or Harrow having been abandoned , he was sent , in
1845	DATE	, to
Doncaster School	ORGANIZATION	, where he spent three half years not unprofit - ably , making fair progress in all branches -LRB- including drawing -RRB- save , as we infer from the following observation , the classics . ''

		The misfortune was that the classics were not taught as literature at all , but as exercises in grammar and prosody .

		They were dissected by teachers who were simply lecturers on the science of language , and who had not large views even about that .

		Our whole atten - tion being directed to the technicalities of the peda - gogue , we did not perceive that the classic authors had produced poems which , as literature , were not inferior to those of our best English poets . ''

		Blinded thus by those who should have known better to the beauties of Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	, the boy found out for himself the charms of the native poets notably
Scott	PERSON	, of whom he says : '' Of all the influences that had sway over me in those days and for long afterwards , the influence of
Scott	PERSON	was by far the strong - est. '' From Doncaster Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	returned to
Burnley Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he was under the care of Dr.
Butler	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards his private tutor -RRB- , a kindly man guilty of spoiling his boys by sparing the rod , but in advance of the average Orbilius of his day and class in that he heretically '' did not think education should be confined to the two dead languages , but incited the boys to learn French and Ger - man , and even chemistry . ''

		At
Burnley School	ORGANIZATION	the author etched his first plate '' a portrait of a Jew with a turban , '' and '' frightfully overbitten . ''

		In 1850 Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	went to live with his guardian at
Hollins	LOCATION	, in the country ; and here his natural and life-long taste for gipsey - ing and aquatics -LRB- to which his readers owe so many pleasant passages -RRB- was first mildly in - dulged .

		A primitive catamaran launched on a Lancashire fish-pond was the first of a long series of experiments with that delusive order of craft .

		About this period his love of medise - valism , imbibed from
Scott	PERSON	, led to the produc - tion of a little book -LRB- his first printed one -RRB- on heraldry , which had some sale .

		Up to this point his tastes had been conservative and aris - tocratic , and consonant enough with his guard - ian 's plans as to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		But now there came a change , a revolution which , he says , '' was the most important intellectual crisis of my life , and which deserves a chapter to itself . ''

		Into the details of this chapter we can not go here .

		As the reader will have surmised , the '' crisis '' was a religious one .

		At seven - teen the thinking , earnest youth found himself spiritually at the parting of the ways .

		Inquiry bred doubt , and doubt meant inability to sign the Thirty-Nine Articles that is , to conform to a then condition precedent to entering Ox - ford .

		This lapse must have been a sad shock to the kind guardian , who was orthodox to the backbone , and would doubtless herself have gone as a rejoicing witness to the stake .

		Ox - ford and the Church abandoned , the choice of a calling became necessary though Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- erton had some means , enough , he says , `` to enable me , as a bachelor , to live like a gentle - man . ''

		He at once declared for literature and painting .

		He adds : '' I have been sometimes represented as an unsuccess - ful painter who took to writing because he had failed as an artist .

		It is , of course , easy to state the matter so , but the exact truth is that a very moderate success in either literature or art would have been equally ac - ceptable to me , so that there has been no other failure in my life than the usual one of not being able to catch two hares at the same time .

		I decided to try to be a painter and to try to be an author , and see what came of both attempts . ''

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's first master in painting was Mr.
J. P. Pettitt	PERSON	, whom he met at
Keswick	ORGANIZATION	in
1852	DATE	.

		In the year following he fell under Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's influence , touching which he makes the following sound observations : '' It was a good influence in two ways , first in litera - ture , as anything that Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	has to say is sure to be well expressed , and after that it was a good influence in directing my attention to certain qualities and beau - ties in nature ; but in art this influence was not merely evil , it was disastrous ... it tended directly to en - courage the idea that art could be learned from nature , and that is an immense mistake .

		Nature does not teach art , or anything resembling it ; she only provides mate - rials .

		Art is a product of the human mind , the slow growth of centuries .

		If you reject this and go to nature , you have to begin all over again , the objection being that one human life is not long enough for that . ''

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 From the foregoing one may fairly infer that the writer admitted to himself that he had real - ized too late in life the truth that painting is at bottom a refined handicraft ; and that high mental gifts coupled with the closest study of nature are of little avail to the painter unless he be a master of the tools and technique of his craft .

		In
1853	DATE	Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	began his '' new
London	LOCATION	life '' as a pupil in the studio of his Iveswick friend , Mr.
Pettitt	PERSON	.

		His account of this period contains some interesting memories of artists and writers
Leslie	PERSON	, Constable , Land - seer ,
Doyle	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	,
Miss Marian Evans	PERSON	, and others .

		At one time he had a notion of going to
Egypt	LOCATION	, as artist - traveller . ''

		I mentioned , '' he says , '' this pro- ject to Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, who said that he avoided travelling in countries where he could not be sure of ordinary comforts , such as a white table - cloth and a clean knife and fork ; still , he would put up with a great deal of inconvenience to be near a mountain . ''

		In
April , 1854	DATE	, Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	returned to the country ; and , he says , '' from that day to this I have never lived in
London	LOCATION	, which has probably been a misfor - tune to me , both as artist and writer . ''

		A trip to the
Highlands	LOCATION	in the same year resulted in a little volume entitled '' The Isles of Loch Awe and other Poems , '' which appeared the day the author came of age ,
September 10 , 1855	DATE	.

		In the autumn of this year Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- erton made his first trip to
Paris	LOCATION	, where he met his future wife , Mile .


Eugenie Gindriez	PERSON	, daugh - ter of a gentleman who had been Prefect of the
Doubs	LOCATION	under the second Republic , and who was living quietly at
Paris	LOCATION	, under mild political surveillance , under the Empire .

		The subject of marriage , or even of attachment , was not at this time broached between the young people .

		Says Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	: '' I , for my part , left
Paris	LOCATION	without being aware that
Mademoiselle Gindriez	PERSON	had anything to do with my future destiny ; but she , with a woman 's perspicacity , knew better .

		She thought it at least probable , if not certain , that I should return after long years ; she waited patiently , and when at last I did return there was no need to tell on what errand . ''

		The marriage took place at
Paris	LOCATION	in
May , 1858	DATE	.

		On the eventful morning , as Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	recalls , there was a garqon of the hotel brushing the waxed floor on the landing outside his door . ''

		I had a flowered white silk waistcoat on , and the man said , ' Monsieur est bien beau ce matin on dirait qu'il va aune noce . '

		I answered : ' Vous avez bien de - vine ; en effet , je vais a une noce . '

		It was unnecessary to give him further information . ''

		The pair journeyed at once to their wild High - land home on Loch Awe of all strange places in the world , Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	admits , surely the least suitable for a young Parisienne to be brought to .

		On the day of their arrival the Loch was shrouded in a fog so dense that the young bride could scarcely believe there was a high mountain opposite : nothing was visible from Innistrynich but a still , gray , shoreless sea .

		But this first frown of Nature proved no symbol of the future .

		With the arrival at Innistrynich Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- erton 's quota of the volume ends and his wife 's begins .

		To Mrs.
Hamerton	PERSON	's Memoir , which is a very charming , frankly written composi - tion , we have little space to devote much less than the work deserves .

		It gives a sat - isfactory account of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's life and work after
1858	DATE	, and is brightened with much lively chat as to the writer 's own experiences , domestic and social , in
Scotland	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Hamerton	PERSON	details with much pleasant naivete her not altogether cordial reception at the hands of her husband 's relatives -LRB- who were a little disappointed at his choosing a wife abroad -RRB- notably of a certain Aunt
Susan Hamerton	PERSON	, a Shandean character recalling in a way
David Copperfield	PERSON	's peppery but excellent Aunt Betsy Trot wood .

		Aunt
Susan	PERSON	's hostility to the French fell little short of Miss Trot - wood 's to donkeys ; but she finally melted be - fore the grace and amiability of her niece .

		The story of the reconcilement is prettily told : '' One morning I was gathering strawberries in the garden ... Aunt
Susan	PERSON	came up and offered to help me .

		Never shall I forget the scene when we both rose from the strawberry-beds , with our fragrant little bas - kets well filled .

		We turned towards the lake , whose soft , hazy glamor matched that of the tender sky ; the air was still , and there reigned a serene silence , as if a single sound might have desecrated the almost religious peace of earth and heaven ; yet a smothered sob was heard as I felt myself caught in a close embrace , my head laid upon a heaving bosom , my hair moist with warm tears , a broken voice murmuring : ' My child , how I have wronged you !

		... and now I love you so ' ` Oh !

		Aunt
Susan	PERSON	, ' I said , ` do n't cry ; I will love you too ; my husband will be so happy . '

		We kissed each other , and said no more , and from that time Aunt
Susan	PERSON	became my most faithful friend . ''

		Mrs.
Hamerton	PERSON	has naturally many kind things to say of this country , where her hus - band 's works have always been deservedly pop - ular ; and in this connection we may quote her note touching the honorable -LRB- if perhaps , from the piratical point of view , Quixotic -RRB- behavior towards Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	of an American pub - lishing firm , at a period when the rights of the British author here were fenced by no law - save THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the moral one , '' Thou shalt not steal . ''

		Says our author -LRB- 1868 -RRB- : `` For some time past , Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's reputation had been growing in
America	LOCATION	, but he did not derive the slightest profit from the sale of his books there till Messrs.
Roberts Brothers	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, proposed to pay him a royalty upon the works that should be published by them in advance of pirated editions .

		This offer was accepted with pleasure and gratitude , and the pecuniary result proved a timely help . ''

		We can promise Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's many American admirers a treat in the perusal of this attractive volume .

		E. G. J. PRESENT EDUCATIONAL , TENDENCIES .

		* The two main trends in education to-day in the
United States	LOCATION	seem to be the importation of German ideas and the application of physio - logical and psychological science to child study and pedagogic theory .

		Hegel and Herbart among German philosophers are especially studied , and three of the books on our present list directly concern them .

		At least five others show the influence of the second trend .

		about a hundred pages , is practically a popular life of
Hegel	LOCATION	, but a very carefully studied ^ though not very original , presentation .

		The second part , of about the same number of pages , gives many of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's most suggestive thoughts on education , and is preceded by a short but interesting introduction .

		Dr.
W. M. Bryant	PERSON	's little book on ''
Hegel	PERSON	's Educational Ideas '' is a far slighter contribu - tion to the subject than the one just noticed , yet it shows a certain originality and sugges - tiveness .

		Though the essay is an attempt to interpret
Hegel	PERSON	's theory with direct reference to the educational needs of our own times , it is too general and indefinite to be of much service to practical teachers .

		The Hegelianism is somewhat too florid , and there is constant over - emphasis , as evidenced by the profuse itali - cizing .

		In Herbart 's '' A B C of Sense Perception '' we have a more definite contribution to peda - gogy than in the case of the two previous vol - umes .

		Here Herbart expounds with some ful - ness his views of sense perception , and his mathematical methods of training it , that is by '' the apperception of form through con - cepts , '' of which the triangle is the master one .

		This developing percept through concept is rather a reversal of the common method nowa days , which appeals solely to percepts to guide to concepts .

		Among the minor works trans - lated in this volume the most interesting and important is doubtless '' The ^ Esthetic Presen - tation of the Universe the Chief Office of Edu - cation , '' in which
Herbart	PERSON	sets forth his ideal of education as the coordinate developing of Cognition and Sympathy toward the highest point , where the universal ethical and aesthetic significance is fully comprehended and acted on .

		Those who wish to attempt Herbart at first hand have in this book their opportunity .

		The translation appears to be well done by an enthusiastic Herbartian , Dr.
W. J. Eckoff	PERSON	, who has added prefaces and introductions and an exhaustive analysis .

		To the second trend of educational tenden - cies , the psychological , belongs the volume on '' Child Observations . ''

		This book consists of a bare record of rather commonplace observa - tions , preceded by an Introduction by Principal
E. H. Russell	PERSON	.

		We are there told that these records are '' not a scientific study of children , in the interest of psychology , but an attempt to bring our future teachers into closer and more sympathetic relations with them as individ - uals . ''

		We do not think this attempt to divorce
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 sympathy and knowledge is very successful .

		Knowledge is necessary to sympathy , and sym - pathy to knowledge .

		All real insight quickens sympathy , and all sympathy quickens insight , which must be scientific to be true .

		As the physician and professional nurse study cases in the light of pure science , so must the educator do for his pupils .

		It is somewhat singular that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, after so vigorously declaiming against the selfishness of making child-life * ' material '' for science , should yet -LRB- p. xxxiii . -RRB-

		consider the '' highest ideal '' of such study as helping the observer to a full enjoyment of the varying phases of childhood .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	-LRB- _ p. xxix . -RRB-

		makes far too sharp a distinction between the child and the adult .

		In short , the introduction is quite too one-sided ; and the main body of the book , as a record of facts , shows too little insight by the observers , though it may impress some teachers with the power and scope of the mimetic tendency in children .

		In striking contrast with this rather crude work is Compayre 's '' Intellectual and Moral Development of the Child , '' which is an ex - tremely careful and thorough , yet sympathetic , summary of infant psychology .

		It is a clear and on the whole candid resume of the psychol - ogy of the first few months of the child 's life , as illustrating perception , emotion , memory , imagination , and attention .

		Professor Com - payre often writes both clearly and forcibly , as when he says : '' While in the adult the expres - sion falls short of the reality , in childhood it exceeds it .

		The child 's embraces are in excess of his love ; he cries more than he suffers ; he laughs more than he is amused ; and when he has learned to talk , he will talk more than he thinks . ''

		It will certainly occur to many that talking more than one thinks is not wholly con - fined to children .

		The book would be improved by the addition of an index , and of a tabular outline of the growth of mind ; or at least these features should be incorporated in
Part II.	LOCATION	, which we are glad to note is to follow this vol - ume .

		The third volume in the '' Republic of Child - hood '' series , coming after the volumes on ``
Froebel	PERSON	's Gifts '' and ``
Froebel	PERSON	's Occupa - tions , '' is now before us with the title '' Kinder - garten Principles and Practice . ''

		It treats , in a very clear and lively way , and yet with discrim - inating enthusiasm , of such topics as Nature - Study , Moral Training , and
Kindergarten Play	ORGANIZATION	.

		As an interpretation and application of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	, it will be of great value to parents and teach - ers who wish an introduction to his system .

		Froebel , indeed , studied the child mainly through sympathy , but yet not unscientifically ; still , he made but a beginning , and on the whole he erred rather in over-emotionalism and over - tenderness toward making childhood a world in itself rather than a passing stage of develop - ment .

		This book , however , corrects to some extent this tendency , and becomes a very good introduction to modern Kindergarten practice .

		It may be doubted , however , whether the fem - inine spirit which so dominates Kindergarten - ism at present gives the complete environment for the young child , and whether it would not gain something by a training by men kinder - garteners .

		What the work just noticed does for the kin - dergarten ,
James Johonnot	PERSON	's '' Principles and Practice of Teaching '' does for the graded pub - lic school .

		We have here a thoroughly pro- gressive manual for the use of practical teach - ers .

		Training in natural science and in man - ual arts is especially emphasized .

		Still , the author by no means neglects the moral and a3sthetic culture .

		With regard to the former , he has a severe standard for the teacher as well as the pupil . ''

		Of course , '' he says , '' no per - son addicted to the use of strong drink or to - bacco should ever presume to take upon him - self the office of teacher . ''

		This revised edition of a well-known work especially emphasizes the interdependence of studies .

		In an appendix is reprinted the interesting '' Story of a School , '' which so fully illustrates Mr.
Johonnot	PERSON	's ideas on '' incidental '' moral training .

		Mr.
A. H. Garlick	PERSON	's `` New Manual of Method '' is primarily intended for young teach - ers in English schools , and will hardly interest the American teacher save by an occasional suggestion by way of comparison of American and English practice .

		There are some points on which the American teacher would be sure to dissent , for instance , the necessity of cor - poral punishment , and the advisability of allow - ing poetry to be studied only at a late period in the pupil 's work in English literature ; but in the main it will be found a sound though rather conservative manual .

		In the neat little volume entitled '' The Ed - ucation of Children at
Rome	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
George Clarke	PERSON	publishes his doctorate dissertation .

		It deals with the intellectual and moral side of Roman education , and brings out fully the practical bent of Roman life .

		The book is clearly written , and seems a trustworthy and scholarly handbook , and the only special work on the subject in the English language .

		282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	r Mr.
R. P. Halleck	PERSON	, in his '' Education of the Central Nervous System , '' aims mainly at sen - sory training .

		His special aim `` consists in showing that recalled images of sense objects are powerful and necessary aids in further mod - ifying and developing the sensory cells ; not images of sight alone , but of every sense ... From long personal experience , the author can testify that the majority of pupils can soon be induced to seize the first opportunity to obtain definite sensory knowledge of any object men - tioned in poetry , whether of a daffodil , of a murmuring pine , or of * incense breathing morn . ' ''

		How the study of literature may help the study of nature , and vice versa , is a very interesting topic , which , however , is plainly psychological , and receives very little elucida - tion from the study of the central nervous sys - tem .

		The most original and suggestive chap - ters are `` Special Sensory Train ing `` and `` Form - ation of Images , '' where definite exercises are set , and a sort of sensory gymnastics prescribed .

		Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	has been well known for years as a power in educational affairs , es - pecially in the West ; and his volume on '' The Care and Culture of Men '' presents in popular form the ideas which have made him so influ - ential as a radical leader .

		In such chapters as those on '' The Value of Higher Education , '' '' The Scholar in the Community , '' `` The School and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' we have large , hopeful , and progressive ideas , set forth in the vigorous style of an accomplished orator , and enlivened with varied quotation , incident , and anecdote .

		Even those who disagree fundamentally with Dr.
Jor	PERSON	- dan 's main positions will find much that is of value .

		While the book is in no large sense an addition to pedagogical literature , it will yet be stimulating to teachers and others interested in education .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		THE LIFE OF
WILLIAM H. SEWARD	PERSON	.

		* Rich in material illustrative of the early and middle periods of the political history of the
United States	LOCATION	, the '' American Statesmen Se - ries '' has contained but two volumes covering the important years between the Compromise of
1850	DATE	and the Civil War , these being the biog - raphies of
Lewis Cass	PERSON	and
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		The story of
William Henry Seward	ORGANIZATION	would be acceptable as a valuable contribution to our his - * WILLIAM
HENRY SEWARD	PERSON	.

		By

Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		tory , giving as it does a full account of the problems connected with slavery between the
Kansas Bill	ORGANIZATION	and Emancipation , even were it not permeated with the personality of the great statesman whose name appears upon the title - page .

		For thirty-one years , beginning as Gov - ernor of
New York	LOCATION	and ending as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	under
Johnson	PERSON	, he gave his life to the public .

		The most momentous questions of American history were decided during this period ; political parties sprang into being and died ; legislative struggles gave place to the battle of bullets .

		It was a difficult task to keep the story within the limits of a single vol ume , and the decision to give greater attention to the decade from
1855 till 1865	DATE	was a proper one , considering the prominence of the position of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	in that trying time .


William H. Seward	PERSON	was a man of inferior physique , with few graces of oratory and little power to command the attention and sway the feelings of an audience .

		When his contem - poraries , Clay or
Webster	PERSON	, addressed the Sen - ate , every seat was filled and every nerve was strained to catch the full effect of the words of the speaker ; when
Seward	PERSON	spoke , it was to empty benches .

		But , while sometimes the influ - ence of the speeches of the gifted orators passed away with the dramatic triumphs of the moment of delivery , the words of
Seward	LOCATION	, widely scat - tered and translated for the benefit of foreign - born readers , had as great influence in molding the thought of the people during the years of his public life as any other force operating in our history .

		In this connection it is necessary to mention only the speeches in which he set forth the '' higher law , '' the '' irrepressible con - flict , '' and his views in opposition to the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise .

		Seward was a man who often showed great lack of tact in dealing with his fellows and in discussing burning questions of the day .

		He left the executive chair at
Albany	LOCATION	, sharing with the public generally the feeling that his public life was ended .

		His college essay , showing the
Erie Canal	ORGANIZATION	an impossibility as well as a source of financial ruin to the state , was a youthful predecessor of later effusions of similar weak - ness .

		He published an unfortunate letter at the opening of
Taylor	ORGANIZATION	's administration , de - signed to exonerate the President from the charge of using his personal influence for leg - islation that would practically extend slavery to the territories , but which had the effect of calling the attention of the public to his own friendly relations with the President , and inci -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 dentally of alienating other prominent Whig leaders .

		The same lack of tact was shown on the occasion of the visit of the Hungarian pa - triots to the
United States	LOCATION	, in the dealings with
Justice Campbell	ORGANIZATION	at the outbreak of the Re - bellion , in his dispatch to Minister
Adams	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, reflecting or seeming to reflect upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and , most conspicuous example of all , in his '' Thoughts for the President 's Con - sideration , '' when he volunteered to run the gov - ernment for Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	.

		If he failed as an orator , except in the coin - ing of apt phrases that served as political catch - words , and often displayed weakness in critical moments , he had in him a more striking ele - ment of worth , which led him again and again , during his long and varied public career , to re - fuse to sacrifice principle for expediency .

		He manifested this quality in taking charge of un - popular criminal cases in his law practice , in adhering to his support of
Adams	PERSON	for the pres - idency when he held in his hand a position offered by a rival candidate ,
Clinton	PERSON	, and in fav - oring a recognition of parochial schools in the distribution of public funds for education .

		He opposed the policy of Fillmore on the
Compro	LOCATION	- mise measures , when such action meant the proscription of himself and his party friends in
New York	LOCATION	.

		He antagonized the leaders of the Know-Nothing movement , when by using them he might have received the nomination for the presidency in
1856	DATE	, and , by carrying states which were opposed to
Fremont	LOCATION	, have made himself President .

		He favored strengthening the hands of the President in the Mormon mat - ter , when his fellow Republicans opposed it , recalling the use of the army in
Kansas	LOCATION	; and he was not moved by the sinister allusions to '' bedevilled '' persons and '' Judas Iscariot . ''

		These characteristics of the man are admir - ably brought out by Mr.
Lothrop	PERSON	,
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's new biographer .

		Blame is not spared when serious blunders were made , and over-praise is not given for the excellences that shone on other occasions .

		To this extent the volume will be generally considered a success ; when contro - versies are discussed , there may be differences of opinion .

		The '' malignant posthumous attack on Seward , '' made by
Montgomery Blair	PERSON	in Mr.
Welles	PERSON	's '' Lincoln and
Seward	PERSON	, '' charging Mr.
Seward	PERSON	with forcing the repeal of the Mis - souri Compromise by putting up
Dixon	PERSON	of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky to move it , is completely answered by the correct statement of the facts of history .

		The chapter which discusses the relations existing between Mr.
Seward	PERSON	and
Justice Campbell	ORGANIZATION	is not so satisfactory .

		If the former was not aware that the latter was wearing the livery of the
Federal Courts	ORGANIZATION	to serve the Confederacy in , he yet appeared in an unfortunate role , and displayed the same lack of discretion which he so often manifested elsewhere .

		In the assign - ment of credit in connection with the Trent affair , the difficult task of removing laurels from a popular idol is satisfactorily done .

		Americans are becoming very sensitive about
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's life of Lin - coln , and a recent monograph upon `` The Trent Affair '' by Mr.
Thomas L. Harris	PERSON	, state conclusions essentially different from those reached by Mr.
Lothrop	PERSON	; but the weight of authority is with the latter .

		More than once , when diplomatic difficulties were discussed , Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's notions were utterly impractica - ble and needed the revision of such a thought - ful mind as that of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	; but the conclusion is definitely reached that in the Trent affair Mr.
Seward	PERSON	took the initiative as the Secretary responsible for foreign relations , and that Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	and the other members of the cabinet came to his position .

		The spe - cial chapter on diplomatic questions clearly indicates the variety of international problems of the period of the Civil War , and emphasizes the great services of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	in a field where the pen rather than the sword won vic - tories for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other chapters of the book might call for consideration if the limits of space would allow .

		The story of the development of the Republican party and the account of the convention of
1860	DATE	are naturally marked by a strong
Seward	ORGANIZATION	sentiment .

		The strictures on
Horace Greeley	PERSON	seem warranted after a re-reading of
Greeley	ORGANIZATION	's own statement in his '' Recollections of a Busy Life '' ; and while there appears a discordant note in the references to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	in connection with the nomination in
1860	DATE	, it is the comparatively unknown
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	of that year who is mentioned , and not the great emancipator enshrined in the hearts of the people .

		Too many unsettled matters re - main to make it worth while to note the diffi - culties of Reconstruction connected with the administration of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	, but it is questionable if a due amount of attention is paid to the
Alaska	LOCATION	purchase , which is dismissed with a short paragraph and without recognition of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's prescience as to the import - ance of the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	in the manifest des - tiny of the
United States	LOCATION	, in which he firmly believed .


FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON	PERSON	.

		284 -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, THE COUNTRY OF HORACE AND VIRGIL .

		*
M. Marie Louis Gaston Boissier	PERSON	is one of those charming French scholars who are such graceful interpreters of the best thought of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Since
1876	DATE	, he has been the incumbent of a fauteuil in the French Academy , and has not slept in it , as his several books and frequent articles attest : possibly , too , his
august	DATE	duties as permanent secretary of the Immortal Forty have helped to stimu - late his activity .

		Formerly professor of Latin oratory at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	, he has rarely departed from the field of Roman study covered by the last years of the Republic and the first century of the Empire .

		His scholarship , while not portentous , is yet painstaking ; his conclu - sions in matters of classic topography are based upon thorough personal investigation : and the arguments with which these conclusions are presented are so graciously and winningly sug - gested for our consideration that we can not but extend to them the courtesy common among gentlemen , and perhaps yield to their charm of manner the assent which a more hardened say a Teutonic critic would withhold .

		In a certain sense
M. Boissier	PERSON	may be said to have done for
Horace	PERSON	and
Virgil	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	what the lamented
Sellar	PERSON	has done for them in
England	LOCATION	; though his work lacks the steadiness of glow and the symmetrical unity of '' The Roman Poets of the Augustan Age . ''

		The book before us is a translation of his '' The Country of
Horace	PERSON	and
Virgil	PERSON	, '' in which the poets ' personalities are projected , as it were , against a background formed by their favorite haunts .

		To
Horace	PERSON	are devoted fifty-eight pages .

		Then follows an excursus -LRB- pp. 59-115 -RRB- on the tombs of Corneto ; and the rest of the book -LRB- pp. 116-346 , or just two-thirds of the whole -RRB- is occupied with
Virgil	PERSON	and the ^ Eneid .


M. Boissier	PERSON	sketches with free hand the rela - tions of Horace to
Maecenas	LOCATION	; and dwells on the joy the poet must have felt in receiving from the hands of his patron an estate in the
Sabine	LOCATION	hill-country .

		To locate this country-house is the labor of love which our author sets for him - self ; and he invites his readers to a '' person - ally conducted '' jaunt to the valley of the Anio and the
Licenza	LOCATION	.

		Moving up the west bank of the latter stream , he shows us the spot to which his reading of the poet has led him as the site of the
Villula	LOCATION	, as
Horace	PERSON	modestly terms it ; and * THB COUNTRY OF

New York	LOCATION	:
Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		he finds it half-way up the hill rising west of the river and in the immediate neighborhood of the old church of
Santa Maria della Casa	LOCATION	.

		He gives persuasive reasons for this site , and for differing with
Capmartin de Chaupy	ORGANIZATION	and De Sanctis , who are for a location farther north and more toward the foot of the hill .

		It should be said , however , that Professor
Sellar	PERSON	-LRB- in an elaborate foot-note on page 31 of his ''
Horace	PERSON	and the Elegiac Poets '' -RRB- lends the weight of his authority to the latter view ; and students of
Horace	PERSON	may profitably read and weigh the evidence offered by the French and the En - glish scholar in support of their respective opinions .

		The section of
M. Boissier	PERSON	's book which treats of the Etruscan tombs at Corneto lacks , of course , personal interest ; and it is hard to find adequate reasons for its insertion here .

		As an antiquarian essay it is a piece of good work ; and the matter is presented with the writer 's usual vivacity and a sort of charm -LRB- charis -RRB- , like that which Dionysius assigned to the orator Lysias ; but it serves in the pres - ent instance only as an interruption , which will be skipped by many readers in their hurry to get from
Horace	LOCATION	to
Virgil	LOCATION	.


M. Boissier	PERSON	has certainly added a fresh attraction to the great Augustan epic by his rapid and yet searching analysis of the ^ Eneas legend and his tracing of the process of assim - ilation by which this old Trojan hero came to assume an Italian physiognomy .

		This process is followed from the earliest Homeric account of 2Eneas down to the time when he received his fresh baptism of immortality from
Virgil	LOCATION	.

		The explanation of
Virgil	PERSON	's motives in choos - ing this legend as the subject of a great his - torico-mythological epic is full and satisfactory .

		Then comes an extended but most interesting description of the journeys of ^ Eneas ; in which , with the poem as our guide-book and
M. Bois	PERSON	- sier as a genial and sympathetic cicerone , we are led peacefully enough over land and sea in the track of the much-tried but always pious son of Anchises .

		Sicily , of course , is given a prominent place in these wanderings ; but the chief merit of the work is the successful clear - ing up of obscurities in the topography of the Trojan and Latin camps at the
Tiber	ORGANIZATION	's mouth .

		The sites of
Ostia	LOCATION	, Lavinium and Laurentum are convincingly identified ; the episode of Nisus and Euryalus receives new light ; and the con - cluding battles of the Trojans and
Rutuli	PERSON	are admirably sketched and discussed .

		We are compelled to add that the translation
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 lying before us is an unworthy and slovenly thing .

		The reproach of tradittore traduttore was never more deserved than in this instance .

		It is too bad that so refined a scholar as
Gaston Boissier	PERSON	should be so disastrously presented to American readers as has been his fate in the hands of Mr.
D. Havelock Fisher	PERSON	.

		The errors and blunders swarm in such profusion that they are susceptible of classification .

		Most numer - ous and vexatious are the misprints in Latin citations and Greek or Latin proper names .

		Of the forty-odd specimens in this class we may mention utili for utilis , accipieno for acci - piens , erant for errant , rerem mili for rerum mihi ,

		Before Greek the translator or proof-reader simply '' lies down '' : as seen in the two attempts on pp. 130 , 326 .

		Gains -LRB- p. 77 -RRB- is a poor exchange for games , having an unpleasant suggestion of profession - alism ; and annuli -LRB- p. 110 -RRB- is perhaps intended for curule .

		The author 's sense has evidently been re - versed in this -LRB- p. 60 -RRB- : '' Reluctance to remain ignorant of the past history of a race which held an important place among ancient nations is a thing I can not understand . ''

		On page 62 we read : '' One does not think of stopping at the intermediate stations , it is true , nor does what one sees of the
Tuscan Maremma	LOCATION	in this rapid flight make one wish to visit it more clearly .

		- Yet it is wrong to do so . ''

		To do what ?

		On page 72 , speaking of Etruscan tombs , this translator makes
M. Boissier	PERSON	say or seem to say : '' Nothing now remains which could be carried off that is to say , the mural paintings . ''

		On page 85 , the Marseillais are described as enter - ing
Paris	LOCATION	singing the hymn of '' Rouget de risle '' / the name of the author being quoted and italicized as if it were the name of the song .

		In the matter of dates , 707 -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- should be 717 ; and 514 B. c. -LRB- p. 144 -RRB- should drop the
B.C.	LOCATION	, or change 514 to 240 .

		Such and so many offences as these , whether due to ignorance or carelessness , or both , are yet not enough to obscure the merits of
M. Boissier	PERSON	's book ; and may even give it a facti - tious value as an exercise-book of mistakes , to be corrected by young students of
Horace	PERSON	and

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, it otherwise might .

		His death seems to us uncalled - for , since the whole tenor of the novel is far from tragic in so inevitable a sense as that , and before the catastrophe is reached the way seems already paved for a real union of hearts between Sir
George	PERSON	and his vixenish but chastened wife .

		On the whole , the tragedy of the final chapter seems rather wan - ton .

		The political motive largely influences the ac - tion of this novel , and surprise is frequently occa - sioned by the author 's firm grasp of recent English political life .

		An old parliamentarian could hardly have done better in depicting the course of a momen - tous piece of legislation through the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons , in doing justice to all the interests concerned and seeing the subject from all the points of view , in describing the machinery of the legislative pro- cess .

		The Bill in question is a radical , almost a revolutionary , one ; it seeks effectively to limit the hours of labor and the freedom of the individual , whether employer or employed .

		The Maxwells are heart and soul in its support ;
Tressady	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , is a prominent figure of the opposition , but changes his vote at a critical juncture , and saves both Bill and
Government	ORGANIZATION	, although at the cost of his own political career .

		It need hardly be said that
Marcella	PERSON	exerts the influence , although semi - unconsciously , by which this change of policy for it is not a change of conviction is brought about .

		We feel throughout the wish of the writer to deal fairly with the vital matter under discussion , yet we must admit that she allows emotion to outweigh reason , and that her sympathies are enlisted in be - half of a dangerous principle .

		The balance which in '' Marcella '' seemed to be justly held between the opposing forces of socialism and individualism , seems in '' Sir
George Tressady	PERSON	'' to tip a little too far to the wrong side .

		So much for the argument of the book .

		As for the workmanship , it is so fin - ished and conscientious as to be productive of a high degree of satisfaction ; it betrays a rich human ex - perience , an analytical mind , and a generous heart .

		Somehow it does not interest us as deeply as ''
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Elsmere	LOCATION	'' and ''
David Grieve	PERSON	'' did , although in many respects a fuller mastery of the material is evidenced .

		The force with which Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's novels have impressed us is fully sustained in this the latest of them , but we miss the freshness of appeal which made ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' seem to speak to us with a new voice .

		But the best of novelists can not escape this fate , although some perhaps have come nearer to escaping it than the present writer .

		To turn from the strong , sane , and carefully - balanced picture of life given us in Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's book to the hysterical mysticism of '' Without Sin '' is to experience about as sharp a contrast as books can offer . ''


Martin J. Pritchard	PERSON	'' is , we under - stand , the assumed name of a woman , and the woman has in this case outdone all that man ever dreamed of daring .

		Never before , we should say , did modern novelist attempt so flatly impossible a subject as this .

		And yet the first impulse to con - demn the book without reserve is checked by a feel - ing that somehow the writer could not have imag - ined the unspeakable off ensiveness of her theme and its treatment ; there is a kind of sincerity about the workmanship which forbids the supposition that the writer 's sole aim was to startle her public , and one must reluctantly admit that the narrative is infused with the sentiment that awes us in
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Ave. '' But these qualifications can have no further effect than to soften in some degree the condemnation which both religious and literary criticism are bound to pass upon the fantastical and morbid imaginings of a book that had far better have remained un - written .

		A sort of mysticism is also the note of Mr.
F. W. Bourdillon	PERSON	's '' NepheleY ' but it is as different as possible from the mysticism of the book previously mentioned .

		If it were not for a single matchless lyric , Mr.
Bourdillon	PERSON	's name would be absolutely unknown to the general reader , and as it is , the appearance of a prose romance from his pen is a good deal of a surprise .

		It must be admitted at the outset that the conception of ''
Nephele	PERSON	' '' is based upon an impossibility , but we find this no very grave impediment to the enjoyment of a book so self-consistent within its own limits , and so beautiful as an example of literary composition .

		There is in the handling of the theme so much delicacy and spiritual suggestiveness , so elevated a sentiment , and so pure a diction , that we are willing to accept '' telepathy '' or any other impossiblity when we realize that without it such a book could not have been written at all .

		The story is of a mystical union of souls through the agency of music , and the message of that divinest of arts has rarely been put into words so glowing and so eloquent .

		To the unmusical it must seem a meaningless rhapsody ; but those to whom the world of tone is as real as the world of poetry will take the book to their heart of hearts .

		Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's ''
Kate Carnegie	PERSON	'' seems to have been timed to appear in
America	LOCATION	coincidently with the author 's visit .

		Those who have made his ac - quaintance will find in the book a reflection of his genial personality , and others will be justified in the surmise that they could hardly know him any better from personal intercourse than from his books .

		It is indeed something of a puzzle to account for the popularity of all the '' bonnie brier bush '' writing and '' kailyard literature '' of which this is an aver - age specimen .

		The Scots dialect would seem to be a distinct drawback to one 's enjoyment , and it is impossible to describe the book fairly without ad - mitting that it is both rambling and commonplace .

		It is a menagerie of parsons rather than a novel , for we are treated to no less than three full-length clerical portraits , and the love-story is hardly more than an incident .

		Whatever elements of strength the book may possess are to be sought in its flashes of humor , its touches of pathos , and its shrewd de - lineative strokes .

		It is not remarkable for any of these things , but it is moderately pleasing , and irre - proachably wholesome in sentiment .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 '' The Gray Man '' is a very different sort of story .

		A historical romance of the times of
James VI	PERSON	.

		of
Scotland	LOCATION	, it deals with the clan feuds that kept
Scot	PERSON	- land on the verge of civil war , and is abundantly supplied with picturesque and romantic episodes .

		But it drags a good deal , and its real power is to be sought in the handling of a few special situations rather than in its conception as a whole .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	has probably never done anything better than the chapter which tells us about '' The Last of the Gray Man , '' while two or three other episodes rise to nearly the same level of graphic and dramatic power .

		A good deal of actual history has been worked into the web of the author 's romance , and much of the invention bears the stamp of artistic truth .

		Of the three Scotch novelists now prominently before the public , Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	seems to be the most talented , and he too contributes a book to the season 's output of fiction .

		We are inclined , more - over , to think it the best book he has written .

		Although '' Sentimental Tommy '' shares in the con - structive weakness displayed by the two Scotch stories just mentioned , and is , like them , a series of episodes and sketches rather than an organic whole , there is exhibited in the details of its workmanship so fine an art that criticism may for once be content to praise without cavil .

		The inner life of childhood is for most writers unexplored territory .

		They may write about it and around it , but few retain a mem - ory of their early days so vivid as to enable them to reproduce the world from the child 's point of view .

		But
Stevenson	PERSON	did it , and Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	has done it , and so has Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	in this extraor - dinary book . ''

		Imaginative '' would , however , be a better adjective for his hero than '' Sentimental , '' for it is in his delineation of the imaginative aspect of child-life that the author has achieved his suc - cess .

		The wonder-world that a child can create for himself in the most commonplace environment is here realized with a subtle insight almost beyond praise .

		The story of the last Jacobite rising , for example , comes near to being a work of genius , and can hardly miss some share of the '' immortality '' it deserves .

		Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	has not only been a boy , like the rest of us , but has remained one at heart , as few of the rest of us succeed in doing .

		And his
Tommy	PERSON	is one of the most genuine boys in literature .

		Mr.
Standish O'Grady	PERSON	is the author of a number of romantic novels having for their common pur - pose '' to illuminate , in some degree , aspects of the history , genius , and traditions of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The lat - est two of these works are before us .

		The one , called '' Ulrick the Ready , '' is a story of the closing years of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's reign ; the other , '' In the Wake of
King James	PERSON	, '' a tale of the period just after the Battle of the
Boyne	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
O'Grady	PERSON	is evidently a close student of Irish history and antiquities , but he can - not fairly be called a skilled literary craftsman .

		The first of the books just named is absolutely chaotic in structure , and so swamped with history , genealogy , and archaeology as to be well-nigh unreadable .

		The lecond , being mainly a private concern , has some degree of symmetry , and tells its tale of adventure in a reasonably thrilling way .

		It is far from being unreadable , and its matter is not quite so hackneyed as is the stuff of most of our recent historical fiction .

		The artistic effect that Mr.
O'Grady	PERSON	, despite his knowledge and industry , has failed to produce , ap - pears very noticeably in '' The Silk of the Kine , '' an Irish story of the period when the '' curse of Cromwell '' had just fallen upon the land .

		A well - conceived and pathetic situation is portrayed by the author with swift sure strokes , and the romance is alike pleasing for its narrative and its diction .

		The heroine is a fair maiden of noble birth , orphaned by the wars and '' transplanted '' by order of the Protector .

		A young English officer chances to save her from death or worse , and to intervene in the dangers that subsequently beset her .

		In the end , he sacrifices his position and his prospects for her sake , and is about to carve out for himself a new life upon the Continent , when a pardon from the Pro- tector changes his plans , and serves to make his story end happily . ''

		The King 's Revenge '' takes us back to the early fourteenth century , and has for its chief historical figures the ill-fated
King Edward II	ORGANIZATION	.

		and his hap - less favorite ,
Piers Gaveston	ORGANIZATION	.

		We do not recollect that this story has been used for imaginative pur - poses by any modern novelist , or , indeed , since Mar - lowe found in it the stuff for the greatest of his tragedies .

		Mr.
Claude Bray	PERSON	, the author , has a name that is new to us , but he seems to have learned fairly well the lesson of historical romance .

		Per - haps it would be difficult to learn that lesson ill at a time when the art of fiction based upon history finds so many skilled practitioners .

		Mr.
Bray	PERSON	is weakest in his love story , which is told in the most perfunc - tory manner , and strongest in his delineation of the turbulent barons who plunged
England	LOCATION	into civil war after the strength and resolution of the
First Edward	ORGANIZATION	had given place to the feebleness and vanity of the Second .

		Mr.
Bloundelle-Burton	PERSON	, who appears twice in our current list of novels , delves for his material in the rich mine of French history and chronicle . ''

		In the Day of Adversity '' is a romance of the days of
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, and has a stirring picture of the sea - fight at
La Hogue	ORGANIZATION	, besides a realistic account of the horrors of the galleys , and a web of private intrigue sufficiently complicated to hold the interest at a high tension . ''

		Denounced '' is a story of '' the Forty - five , '' and thus partly English in theme .

		Its chief interest , however , is in the imprisonment of its hero in the
Bastille	LOCATION	by means of a lettre de cachet , and its careful account , based upon documentary evi - dence , of the life of an inmate of that famous , or infamous , stronghold of tyranny .

		The author of these two books has caught the trick of historical romance quite successfully , and his name must be added to the list , already a long one , of recent work - ers in this inexhaustible domain . ''

		The Courtship of
Morrice Buckler	PERSON	'' is a ro - mance that starts bravely out on historical lines , 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, plunging us into the days of
Monmouth Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	and the
Bloody Assize	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the historical thread is soon dropped , and we find our interest enlisted in a romance of private intrigue and adventure which takes us hack and forth from
England	LOCATION	to the
Tyrol	LOCATION	, and abounds in highly-colored passions and villainies .

		The plot is constructed with exceptional skill , and we are not left at the close , as is so often the case in historical romance , with a lot of tag-ends in our hands .

		Everything is explained in the most comfortable way before we get through , the writer thereby earning our very lively gratitude . ''

		Battlement and Tower '' is a historical romance of
Wales	LOCATION	during the Civil War , when the fortunes of the
King	PERSON	were waning , and only a few loyal souls here and there stood fast in their allegiance .

		It is royalist in its sympathies -LRB- as somehow nearly all the good romances of this period are -RRB- , and pursues its course with a fiery energy that holds the reader breathless .

		Those who love fighting , and thrilling escapes , and dare-devil adventures , will find full measure of such things in this book , besides a chronicle of heroic devotion and faithful love .

		The action is often too tangled to be easily followed , and the style is too turgid to be satisfactory , but there is no denying that the story has life and interest in abundance . ''

		The Finding of Lot 's Wife '' is a romance in the manner made familiar by the stories of Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	.

		All that is needed for this sort of story is an imperfectly-known part of the earth , where anything may be supposed to happen for lack of proof to the contrary , and a certain amount of a cheap sort of imagination .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	tells us of a mysterious monastery in southeastern Palestine , inhabited by monks having an ancient ritual of their own , and unknown to the world in general .

		A num - ber of explorers find their way to this spot , investi - gate its marvels , discover among other things the veritable rock-salt statue of Lot 's wife , and escape to civilization in the end .

		The story is strewn with grewsome horrors and romantic adventures , and proves readable , but by no means wildly exciting .

		The readers of Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's '' A Bid for For - tune '' will remember the uncanny Dr.
Nikola	PERSON	and the curious black stick , once owned by `` China
Pete	PERSON	, '' that finds its way into his possession . ''

		Dr.
Nikola	PERSON	'' the book is a sort of sequel to the other romance , and tells us how , by means of the same black stick , the wizard penetrates into an unknown Chinese monastery , and possesses himself of the ancient mysteries of the order .

		It is an extravagant tale , not without a certain interest , and far superior to the story of Lot 's wife as an excitement-producer .

		The marked impetus given of late to the study of colonial history is having its effect upon the novelist , and the number of tales based upon the annals of our forefathers increases steadily from year to year .

		The instinct which leads to the writing of these books is a sound one , although the books themselves are too often antiquarian studies and nothing more .

		It would , of course , be unreasonable to expect an - other '' Scarlet Letter , '' for so rare a genius as that of Hawthorne blossoms only now and then in the centuries ; but it is not unreasonable to hope for a considerable production of historical novels upon American themes that shall be fairly comparable with the many good books that have recently given us such a surfeit of English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	histor - ical romance .

		Such a book as Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's '' King Noanett '' belongs distinctly to this class ; it is an admirably planned and executed story , based upon a careful study of documentary evidence , yet keep - ing the antiquarian subordinate to the human inter - est. .

		It pretends to be the personal narrative of one
Bampfylde Carew	PERSON	, an English youth who becomes implicated in a royalist rising against the govern - ment of the Protector , and is deported to
Virginia	LOCATION	in a convict ship .

		He remains in the Old Dominion for a time , then makes his escape to
New England	LOCATION	, and spends the rest of his days among Puritans and Indians .

		The execution of the work is painstaking , and it need hardly be added that Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's long and successful literary experience stands him in good stead in what must be considered the most ambitious of his novels .

		There is an abundance of picturesque detail in the book , and the thread of a tender love-story runs though it all , giving it coherence and a heightened interest .

		We think there is still a little too much of antiquarianism about the work that the note-book is too much in evidence but when we consider the difficulty of the author 's task , and the fact that he has been working in a new medium , it must be allowed that he has been strikingly successful .

		The illustrations made by Mr.
Henry Sandham	PERSON	have caught the spirit of the text and the time , adding not a little to the attrac - tiveness of the romance . ''

		The Regicides '' is another story of the same period , and has for its subject the adventures of
Goffe	PERSON	and
Whalley	PERSON	in eluding the pursuit of the royal warrant for their arrest .

		The book offers a conscientious study of
Puritan Connecticut	LOCATION	, but can - dor compels to the statement that it proves only mildly exciting at the best , while at the worst it is unmistakably dull .

		In this case , antiquarianism has clearly got the better of art .

		In turning from these essays in romance to the story of '' Mrs.
Cliff	PERSON	's Yacht , '' we turn from actual history to the most whimsical of invention .

		Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's method of treating highly improbable situations in the most matter-of-fact way is too familiar to call for exposition .

		Readers of '' Cap - tain Horn '' will remember Mrs. Cliff well enough , and be prepared for the sober joy of learning what she did with her share of the treasure of the Incas , and how the good people of
Plainton	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, were impressed with her goings-on .

		The story is rather tedious until the yacht appears , and its owner sails the Southern seas with her crew of clergymen .

		At this juncture the story becomes transformed into a thrilling tale of adventure , and justifies its title to be considered a true sequel to '' Captain Horn . ''

		Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	's '' March Hares , '' also , is
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 a whimsical tale , as its title would indicate , but of a sort very different from the book last mentioned .

		The most extraordinary things happen in its pages , and the interest is all the time kept agog , but Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	has too much of the artistic instinct to per - mit even the fantastic creations of this most improb - able narrative to remain mere pegs upon which to hang his inventions .

		In their strangest doings they seem creatures of flesh and blood , and they make their final exit in accordance with the conven - tional forms .

		The book brings fresh testimony to Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's facile versatility , and may be de - pended upon to afford an hour of very genuine amusement .

		When we reviewed the translation of
Herr Pon	PERSON	- toppidan 's '' Emanuel '' a few weeks ago , it was stated that this novel was the first part of a trilogy depicting the Grundtvigian peasant movement in
Denmark	LOCATION	, and the hope was expressed that the other parts '' The Promised Land '' and `` The Day of Judgment '' might also be given to English read - ers .

		Sooner than we anticipated , the wish has been fulfilled , as far , at least , as it concerned the second part of the trilogy .

		In ''
Emanuel	ORGANIZATION	'' we read of the enthusiastic young pastor who renounced his worldly associations , and cast his lot with the peasants to the extent of marrying a girl of their caste .

		In '' The Promised Land , '' we are introduced to the house - hold of this man seven or
eight years later	DATE	, when the illusion has faded , and when he realizes the truth that no man 's will is strong enough to sustain him undiscouraged in breaking with the social tra - ditions and nurture that have formed his character .

		It is the stage of disillusionment that we are now called upon to contemplate , and the picture is simply but powerfully drawn .

		In the end ,
Emanuel	PERSON	and his wife separate by mutual consent for an indef - inite period , and the man goes back to his father 's house in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	to take up what threads he may of the life upon which he fondly thought to have turned his back forever .

		We shall await with great interest the concluding section of this novel , which is so genuine in its human interest , and which lies so far apart from the usual range of English fiction .

		The translation , we regret to say , is far from satisfactory . ''

		Black Diamonds '' is one of the best of the novels of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	that have thus far been put into English .

		We wish , however , that the English were the work of a more competent hand .

		The subject of the work has a great deal to do with coal-mining , and the translator confronts us at times with a sci - entific jargon that is absolutely meaningless , and that will make chemists , in particular , rub their eyes in wonder .

		We suspect that the author is not him - self very accurate in his use of scientific terms , but the translator has undoubtedly added to whatever confusion exists in the original .

		The story is a happy blend of the elements of romance with those of everyday life .

		We have , on the one hand , the romantic environment of mid-Hungary , and , on the other , the intrigues of a gay society and the trickery of the stock exchange .

		The action is varied , ani - mated , and sufficiently exciting to sustain the read - er 's interest , to which a constant appeal is also made by the fresh and piquant aspects given the book by its Hungarian atmosphere .

		The element of the fantastic , which is so characteristic of this novelist , is very marked , and we resign ourselves from the start to the bizarre incident and unexpected happening .

		The author of '' The Green Carnation '' has col - lected into a small volume three short stories of more than usual power .

		They are studies in mor - bid psychology , and one of them , dealing with the reincarnation of a murdered cat , goes to the extreme of the fantastic .

		The cat comes back to life in the form of a beautiful woman , marries her slayer , and strangles him at night .

		The story would be the merest rubbish were it not for a certain Poe-like quality of the imagination displayed in working out this uncanny conception .

		The other two stories move among the possibilities of life , at least , although having little enough to do with life as normally con - stituted .

		We thought that
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	was dead , but it is certainly he who masquerades under an as - sumed name in the '' Chronicles of
Martin Hewitt	PERSON	. ''

		He investigates mysterious cases with the same practised ease as of old , is equally possessed of stores of recondite knowledge , and treats the methods of the professional detective with the same old tolerant condescension .

		Mr.
Morrison	PERSON	is a good imitator , but it takes an unusual degree of audacity to borrow another man 's thunder in this wholesale fashion .

		In every essential respect these stories are
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	stories and nothing more ; the inventions are new , but the conception is without originality .

		Readers of the popular magazines will be prompt to recognize some of their old friends in the volume of seven stories that give us , as far as book-form is concerned , the aftermath of the late
H. C. Banner	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		We are inclined to think '' As One Having Authority , '' here published , the best short story that Banner ever wrote , although '' Zadoc Pine '' is a close second . ''

		Love in Old Cloathes , '' also a favorite , opens the present collection , and has for its fellows '' French for a Fortnight , '' with its irresistibly hu - morous conception , '' Our Aromatic Uncle , '' and three others , the least of which is better than the best of an ordinary story-teller .

		The six '' Tales of Fantasy and Fact '' which Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has put together into a volume are the merest trifles as to substance , but Mr.
Mat	PERSON	- thews has a manner that can make even trifles charming , and his newest book is readable for as long as it lasts . ''

		A Primer of Imaginary Geog - raphy '' is a fancy suggestive of , if not suggested by ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	; '' The Rival Ghosts '' has something of the Stocktonian flavor ; while '' The Twinkling of an Eye '' is neither more nor less than a detective story that mark you took a prize in a news - paper competition .

		The other three stories , if such they may be called , are of much less importance .

		Electricity and magnetism as modes of motion .

		The f unct ' on of the seer has not ended , as many would have us be - \ \ Q VQ ^ but the subjects of his visions have changed in the changing years .


James Clerk Maxwell	PERSON	, the story of whose life and work is so clearly told by his successor , Professor
Glazebrook	PERSON	, in a volume of the '' Century Science Series '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , possessed in a remarkable degree that keener vision which penetrates the arcana of nature and brings to view the methods of her most occult processes .

		Maxwell 's work , done in the third quar - ter of the current century , was expended chiefly along three related lines of physical research .

		The first investigated the subject of
Color Perception	ORGANIZATION	, in which by ingenious methods of combination and rotation he showed that all hues and shades may be produced by properly mingling three primary colors , diluted or darkened with white or black .

		The colors which he judged to be primary are red , green , and violet .

		The second field of his research was that of Molecular Physics .

		In this he studies the be - havior of particles of matter when , after being formed by chemical union , they were subject to the control of physical forces , especially when forming the substance of gases and vapors .

		A gaseous body consists of atoms , simple or chemically compounded , united in minute molecular masses , elastic , and mov - ing constantly , at high velocities , in all directions , in lines normally straight but subject to modifica - tions by mutual inter-influence .

		These conditions submit to the most rigorous mathematical analyses .

		From them arise gaseous elasticity , pressure upon enclosing surface , heat , and kinetic energy .

		Of col - lateral significance , though anterior in point of time , was
Maxwell	PERSON	's discussion of the constitution of the rings of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	as consisting of streams of separate material masses , relatively small , moving in con - stant procession in a common orbit about the cen - tral planet .

		His greatest achievement , however , was his
Theory of Electricity and Magnetism	ORGANIZATION	, a theory of great potency as the foundation of the intense activity of modern electric development , and opening electric science to interpretation by exact mathematical formulae .

		His fundamental hypoth - esis is that there exists in a magnetic field a con - tinuous rotation of molecules about the lines of mag - netic force ; and that their movement constitutes an electric current .

		He says : '' I think we have good evidence for the opinion that some phenomenon of rotation is going on in the magnetic field , that this rotation is performed by a great number of very small portions of matter , each rotating on its own axis , this axis being parallel to the direction of the magnetic force , and that the rotations of these dif - ferent vortices are made to depend on one another by means of some kind of mechanism connecting them .

		Magnetic force is the effect of the centri - fugal force of the vortices .

		Electro-magnetic induc - tion of currents is the effect of the forces called into play when the velocity of the vortices is changing .

		Electromotive force arises from the stress on the connecting mechanism .

		Electric displacement arises from the elastic yielding of the connecting mechan - ism . ''

		Space will not permit the pursuit of this subject into even its nearer phases and relationships .

		But the outcome of the whole may briefly be ex - pressed by saying of Magnetism and
Electricity	ORGANIZATION	what
Tyndall	PERSON	and
Joule	ORGANIZATION	said of Heat , that they are Modes of Motion ; from which statement one more readily comprehends the evidently intimate relation - ship between these physical activities and those which we denominate Heat and Light .

		The first is by Pro fessor Marey of the College of
France	LOCATION	, and is en - titled '' Movement . ''

		The movements of men and animals were first critically observed by Muybridge .

		He arranged elaborate apparatus to take a series of photographs showing the consecutive attitudes as - sumed by a moving animal a trotting horse , for example at minute intervals during one complete cycle of motion .

		The results showed that the con - ventionally artistic trotting-horse usually drawn is merely an amusing fiction .

		Professor
Marey	PERSON	has added a variety of ingenious and accurate methods of observation .

		By placing beneath a horse 's feet air-cushions connected with registering apparatus by rubber tubes fitly arranged , the animal is made to show automatically , upon a continuous sheet , the beginning , duration , and end of every step in any gait he may be using .

		Bright points and lines fas - tened to the black dress of a moving man , and indi - cating the geometrical position of his limbs , prepare for a series of photographs that reveal the consecu - tive positions of those members in the full cycle of any movement .

		A photographic gun contains in its stock a series of sensitive plates ; the gun , being aimed at a flying bird , gives a series of negatives showing the recurring phases of its flight .

		Thus have the motions of many living things men , beasts , birds , insects , fishes , reptiles been observed and recorded .

		Apparatus is also devised for revers - ing the experiment , projecting upon a screen these views in such rapid succession as to make the con - tinuous motion apparent to an audience . ''

		Ice Work , Present and Past , '' by
Professor Bonney of University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, presents the latest dis - cussion of the work of glacial ice in moulding the earth 's surface .

		The facts are presented clearly and concisely , and the conclusions are fairly drawn .

		It is probable , however , that some time will yet elapse before the last word is written upon a subject whose phenomena are so numerous , so varied , and so widely scattered , and so modified in time by other physical agencies . ''

		What is Electricity ? ''

		is by Professor
John Trowbridge	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		No question of physical science meets to-day such intense and persistent inquiry .

		The mind is not content with a definition which limits the concept
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 291 of a physical entity by a description of its activity , or a statement of its effects .

		We are not satisfied to say of Heat that it is something which causes certain phenomena .

		We desire to penetrate yet farther within the veil , and learn what causes Heat .

		Tyndall told us that Heat is a Mode of Motion demonstrating , rather , that Heat is an alternative of Motion ; that when an acting agency may no longer produce motion , then Heat may be gener - ated .

		Does this satisfy our inquiry as to Heat , or its essence ?

		Professor
Trowbridge	PERSON	's last word , offered as an opinion rather than as an assertion , appears to be this : Electricity is a periodic vibra - tion emanating from the sun and transmitted across the ether pervading vacuum which exists between us and that luminary , which , reduced to a simpler equation becomes this : Electricity is a Mode of Motion .

		And this leaves us as hungry as we were before .

		Meanwhile the phenomena of electricity , the earliest and the latest known , in all their bril - liant and bewildering transformations , are set forth in this volume in a manner most satisfactory and instructive .

		When
John Richard Green	PERSON	published his `` Short History of the English People , '' he said he had `` striven throughout that it should never sink into a ' drum and trumpet history , ' '' a mere history of kings and conquests .

		Not every subsequent writer who has had similar ideas of the scope of history has been equally fortunate in expressing them .

		This is per - haps the most serious criticism which may be pro- nounced upon Dr.
W. H. S. Aubrey	PERSON	's `` The Rise and Growth of the British Nation '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Aubrey	PERSON	even attempts to improve on
Green	ORGANIZATION	's title-page , for he declares his three volumes are not only a '' History of the People '' but also '' For the People . ''

		He opens his introductory chapter with a series of ingeniously balanced phrases in which he refers the reader who is seeking information about politics and diplomacy , '' the doings of kings and cabinets , '' to the '' works specially devoted to Court millinery and upholstery . ''

		Although he thus shows a quite proper contempt for many historians whose works The People as well as the aristocracy purchase , his own choice of material at times re - veals a curious notion of the relative value of facts .

		For example , after saying at the beginning of the chapter on Saxon Laws and Usages that charters , wills , etc. , '' furnish a picture of the domestic life of
England	LOCATION	, '' he immediately remarks , '' Horseflesh had been freely eaten , but pork became the favorite meat . ''

		But the author 's rather unhappy way of outlining the province of history does not seriously diminish the usefulness of his work as a repository of information on a great many phases of English history .

		It contains much that the ordinary reader can with difficulty find elsewhere unless he has ac - cess to a library of special works .

		In this respect it reminds one of Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's '' Social England . ''

		Its narratives although perhaps these should be More problems of modern Democracy .

		called comments rather than narratives are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently based on careful investigation and wide read - ing .

		Occasionally , however , events are referred to which have long since lost the dignity of facts .

		It is unnecessary to explain that there was no Prag - matic Sanction of
1268	DATE	, or that
Philip VI	PERSON	.

		did not owe his crown to the Salic law .

		The author 's judg - ments , especially of kings , are often harsh .

		His contempt for
James I.	PERSON	is unmeasured ; he calls
Richard	PERSON	the Lionhearted a '' butcher of men , '' '' bold , reckless , coarse , and brutal ; murdering hostages and captives by hundreds , in sheer wantonness , deaf to pity , to mercy , '' etc. , and speaks of the compan - ions of William the Conqueror as '' banditti , '' `` harp - ies , '' and the like .

		The usefulness of the book is enhanced by a good index , a full table of contents , lists of books , and a chronological table .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	issue a second vol - ume of essays selected from the writ - ings of Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, entitled '' Problems of Modern Democracy . ''

		The papers in this volume are reprinted from leading maga - zines the '' Forum , '' the '' Atlantic Monthly , '' the `` North American Review , '' etc. , and are mostly of quite recent date .

		Some of the titles are : '' The Duty of Educated Men in a Democracy '' ; '' Who Will Pay the Bills of Socialism '' ; The Political Situation in
1896	DATE	'' ; '' The Real Problems of De - mocracy , '' etc. .

		With Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's views on pub - lic questions , and with his terse and pungent man - ner of expressing them , our readers are perfectly familiar ; and we need only say that the present volume shows the author at his best being agree - ably free from a certain note of '' cocksureness , '' and a tendency to carp unduly at the peculiarities of his adopted country , which sometimes render his more ephemeral writings more irritating than con - vincing to the readers who most need to profit by them .

		Of course , the proximity of Tammany is not a thing to sweeten Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's temper or mollify his journalistic style ; and allowance must be made for it .

		The essays before us are serious and well - considered , and deserve altogether their present more permanent setting ; but we regret that Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's remarks -LRB- written in the heat of the mo - mentous campaign just past -RRB- on `` the attitude of the West toward the East '' were not revised before reprinting .

		He broadly asserts -LRB- on grounds inscru - table to us , and our experience of the section of country in question is at least equal to Mr. God - kin 's -RRB- that there is in the West '' a widespread dis - like or distrust of the
East	LOCATION	'' ; that '' it is difficult to persuade him -LSB- the Western man -RSB- that a well-dressed man with superfine manners does not cherish evil designs of some sort '' ; and that '' he does not see how the great fortunes he hears of in the East have been honestly acquired , and he , therefore , would hear with equanimity of the bombardment of East - ern cities , '' All this the writer says without the shadow of a smile .

		Comment is superfluous ; but one would really like to know the source of this 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, amazing concept of '' the Western man . ''

		Were the supposition not irreverent , we should suggest that someone had been '' stuffing '' Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	.

		In the main , the book is worth reading and re-reading ; and it should repeat the success of its lighter and more diversified predecessor .

		The methods and Mr -
Frank Cramer	PERSON	's volume entitled characteristics '' The Method of Darwin '' -LRB- Mc - of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Clurg -RRB- is at once a series of sermons for scholars on texts drawn from the life and work of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, a laboratory guide-book , and a treatise on educational method .

		The author de - fines education as the process of training the intel - lect in the art of reasoning ; he regrets that the college curriculum fails for the most part to fur - ther that process , urges his conviction of the '' su - preme practical importance of the direct study of scientific method , '' and shows how
Darwin	PERSON	is a high example of such method .

		`` His educational his - tory , his thoroughness , his scientific honesty , his logical power , his power of minute observation and broad generalization , the greatness of the prob - lems with which he dealt , and the profound influ - ence of his views upon the thought of the world , all conspire to make him a model in the study of sci - entific method . ''

		In two hundred and thirty-two very readable and suggestive pages , Mr.
Cramer	PERSON	gives a careful analysis of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's mental charac - acteristics and habits of scientific research , treating him as a type of what education should accomplish , and his method as one excellent means of training the intellect in the art of reasoning .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of '' A French Grammar , '' by Dr.
Louis Bevier	PERSON	, to which Dr.
Thomas Logic	PERSON	has contributed a set of exercises .

		The book is designed for older students and is thor - oughly modern and scientific in treatment .

		The same publishers send us M. CoppeVs '' On Rend 1 ` Argent , '' edited by Mr.
T. B. Bronson	PERSON	; and a volume of `` Cop - pe `` e and Maupassant Tales , '' edited by Dr.
A. Guyot Cameron	PERSON	.

		The former of these two volumes departs from the conventional form in being illustrated , and in being printed in the style of a real book rather than of a school book .

		The same publishers also send us the '' Cuore '' of Signer de Amicis , edited by Professor
L. Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	.

		The '' Elements of Geometry '' prepared by Professors
A. W. Phillips	PERSON	and
Irving Fisher	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	is based in its fundamental methods upon the books of the late Professor
Loomis	PERSON	, but is essentially a new work .

		Its most distinctive feature is the series of photographs from models used in the teaching of solid geometry .

		For students of defective imagination these figures can - not fail to be helpful .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Other mathematical text-books just published are : `` New Plane and Spherical Trigonome - try , '' by Mr.
Webster Wells	PERSON	-LRB-
Leach	PERSON	-RRB- ; '' A School Alge - bra , '' by Mr.
E. E. White	PERSON	-LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; `` Ele - mentary and Constructional Geometry , '' by Mr.
E. H. Nichols	PERSON	-LRB- Longmans -RRB- ; and '' A Practical Arithmetic , '' by Mr.
G. A. Wentworth	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The advocates of modern Greek in our universities have been making no little stir of late years , and a cer - tain demand for text-books has thus been created .

		Two such books have just appeared : '' Modern Greek Mas - tery , '' by Mr.
Thomas L. Stedman	PERSON	-LRB- Harper -RRB- ; aud `` A Practical Method in the Modern Greek Language '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , by Mr.
Eugene Rizo-Rangabe	PERSON	'' .

		Both writers are advocates of the teaching of Greek through the modern dialect , and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	makes , in addition , the novel plea that the language is well-fitted to become an international medium or lingua franca for the use of scholars in general .

		Besides the memoir of
James Clerk Maxwell	ORGANIZATION	, noticed elsewhere in this number , another volume of the '' Cen - tury Science Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives an equally inter - esting account of the life of Sir
Humphry Davy	PERSON	, by Professor
F. T. Thorpe	PERSON	.

		Although not the founder of the Royal Institution of
London	LOCATION	,
Davy	PERSON	was the first to give it a substantial impetus , by his brilliant career as a discoverer and lecturer , beginning in the
early months of 1801	DATE	.

		Davy 's fame rests upon discoveries of which some were among the most startling in the history of chemical science .

		Among them may be named the exhilarating effects of nitrous oxide when inhaled ; the isolation by electricity of the metals of the alkalies , potassium , sodium , etc. ; the investigations of chlorine , fluorine , iodine , and their compounds ; and the invention of the lamp , now bearing his name , which greatly miti - gated the dangers from explosive gases in mines of bituminous coal .

		Under the title `` Pioneers of Science of
America	LOCATION	, ''
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a collection of sketches of the lives and scientific work of fifty noted workers of the last century and the earlier portion of the present .

		The list is headed with the name of
Franklin	PERSON	, and includes such others as Audubon , Say ,
Henry	PERSON	,
Morse	PERSON	,
Erricson	LOCATION	, and
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers have been prepared with care .

		Many of them have already appeared , under the supervision of Dr.
Youmans	PERSON	, in the pages of '' The Popular Science Monthly . ''

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons inaugurate an '' Illus - trated English Library '' of standard fiction with
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's ``
Henry Esmond	PERSON	, '' illustrated by Miss
Chris	PERSON	.


Hammond	PERSON	, and
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Hypatia , '' illustrated by Mr.
Lancelot Speed	PERSON	.

		In make-up the series is somewhat sim - ilar to
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's '' Illustrated Standard Novels , '' but the volumes are sold at a much lower price .

		The same publishers send us
Carlyle	PERSON	's ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	, '' with a photogravure portrait from a painting by
Whistler	LOCATION	, as the first volume of their '' Chelsea Library . ''

		As regards paper , typography , and binding , the volumes in these two series leave nothing to be desired , and are a marvel of cheapness besides .

		A ''
Deutsche Sprachlehre	ORGANIZATION	fur Anf anger , '' by Miss
Carla Wenckebach	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also send us two German texts :

Charles B. Wilson	PERSON	; and
Gerstacker	PERSON	's '' Irrfahrten , '' edited by Miss
Marion P. Whitney	PERSON	.

D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of Miss
Hermine Sliiven	PERSON	's '' Praktische Anfangsgriinde , '' a very elementary book .

		The Ode'on at

		This beautiful little book , the Journal of the great-great-grandmother of the present King and Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	, published last year , has been suc - cessful and has had a large sale from the first , but only gradually does its full beauty and at - tractiveness become known .

		In the
July	DATE	number of the old , staid , and most learned `` Edinburgh Review or Critical Journal '' appears a most appreciative review of the book , filling twenty-one pages , which begins as follows : '' This curious little volume , the authenticity of which we have been at some pains to verify , comes to us from
America	LOCATION	, the only other translation being in French .

		In this , which is free and fluent , occa - sional expressions betray that
Kasimir Dziekonska	PERSON	, if indeed a
Pole	LOCATION	, has lived and learned in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But the task of rendering into another lan - guage the frank outspoken utterances of a young girl as frank in some instances as
Marie Bash	PERSON	- kirtseff herself has been done , as it comes to us , with great success .

		The diary of a Polish lady of high degree , written a hundred and fifty years ago , could hardly fail to be instructive , as throwing light on the customs and prejudices existing in her coun - try at that time ... The book therefore has a double value .

		It is , first , a ` human document ' delineating with extraordinary frankness the vanity , the ambition , the passion , but also the unselfishness and tenderness , which go to make up the remark - able character of the young writer .

		Secondly , it is a picture , Holbinesque in its fidelity , of the feudal state in which a great Polish nobleman lived in the
last century	DATE	, when elsewhere such conditions of life had long since become impossible . ''

		`` None of these charming , witty , bright-glancing sketches of Mr.

		Cloth , octavo ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		In '' Cinder-Path Tales '' Mr.
Lindsey	PERSON	has written stories of field and track which have technical consistency , and all the added coloring that a glowing imagination and a vivid memory of past enjoyment can give .

		He has succeeded wonderfully well in transferring to its pages the true atmosphere of the athletic field .

		Not alone the tangible surroundings of warm sunlight and free air , but its patient repression , its fun and philosophy , its disappointments and its glory . ''

		Mr.
Lindsey	PERSON	has put into these stories the crunch of the Cinder-Path , the very breath of the running track , as only an athlete could have done it .

		Tales which turn upon a race are common enough , but the author of the yarns in question tells them as such things really happen , not as a fertile imagination would naturally think they ought to happen for the purposes of literature . ''

		From the

		Extract from a Twenty-two Page Review of this Book . ''

		This curious little volume , the authenticity of which we have been at some pains to verify , comes to us from
America	LOCATION	, the only other translation being in French ... The book has a double value .

		It is , first , a ' human document ' delineating with extraordinary frankness the vanity , the ambition , the passion , but also the unselfishness and tender - ness , which go to make up the remarkable char - acter of the young writer .

		Secondly , it is a pic - ture , Holbinesque in its fidelity , of the feudal state in which a great Polish nobleman lived in the
last century	DATE	, when elsewhere such conditions of life had long since become impossible . ''

		From the LITERARY WORLD ,
London	LOCATION	,
Oct. 30 , 1896	DATE	. ''

		How such a fascinating bit of autobiography should have so long escaped the present-day rage for memoirs can only be accounted for by the difficulties of the Polish language ... The narrative is inter - esting from the first page to the last , and though written in an artless , girlish style , shows the writer to have been a bright , intelligent , and observant young person .

		It gives a graphic picture of the manners , customs , and ideas which obtained in the
Poland	LOCATION	of the eighteenth century ... We com - mend this little volume as a delightful peep into the domestic life of a country little known in the days of its independence .

		It would make a charming present for young girls . ''

		This Dictionary presents within the limits of a single volume , in a concise and convenient form , and un - der one alphabet , the subjects that have usually been treated of in sep - arate works .

		Its topics comprise : Greek and Roman Antiquities -LRB- in the conventional sense of the term -RRB- , Biography -LRB- including not only the personages of Ancient History , but also the great classical scholars , archaeologists , and philologists from the Renaissance to the present day -RRB- , Geography , History , Literature , and Mythology .

		In the way of collateral information , much space is devoted to topics of the utmost interest to the student , which meet him every - where in the way of allusion , but which no single work has yet sys - tematically collected for separate treatment .

		Each important article gives a carefully selected list of the best and most recent works relating to the subject , thus directing the student to a fuller course of reading in English , German , French , and Italian .

		Illustrations , many of which were heretofore unpublished , and maps and diagrams taken from the most approved sources , are freely introduced .

		Important subjects re - lating to Antiquities are given not merely under their Greek and Latin titles , but under their English names as well , so that one who wishes to find a particular article and can not recall the Greek or Latin name can turn to it in English and there find the reference to the proper title a plan which does away with the neces - sity of a set of cumbersome indexes .

		The Dictionary is in reality a con - densed Classical Encyclopaedia .

		Spe - cimen pages of this work will be sent to teachers and professors upon receipt of application by the pub - lishers .

		Then those decorative styles which have not arisen so naturally , and which are rather added to the building than an integral part of it , such as the ornamentation of the Imperial Roman buildings , are also explained and criticised .

THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one of the most exquisite symbolical tales to be found among American writings ,
Haw	PERSON	- thorne has dealt with the entertainment of angels unawares , emphasizing a situation as old as literature , as old perhaps as the mythology that lies back of literature in the childhood of the world .

		Readers of '' The Great Stone Face '' will remember how it was prophesied that the features carved in the granite of the mountains should one day find their counter - part in warm flesh among the inhabitants of the Franconian valley , and how the hero of the story , looking forward to the fulfilment of this prophecy , suffered repeated and bitter disap - pointment as one famous man after another failed to meet the test , himself all unconscious that a life of helpful toil and noble aspiration was gradually shaping his own features into the desired likeness , and his neighbors all unwit - ting of the fact that the long-heralded incarna - tion of the
Great Stone Face	ORGANIZATION	had dwelt in their midst from his birth .

		It has ever been the fashion of prophecy , from the days of the Delphian oracle down to our own , to get fulfil - 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ment in unexpected ways ; and it is possible that the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	, of which the appearance has so long been prophesied , may already have come into existence .

		Many an American critic , jealous for his country 's liter - ary repute , and eager to assert the final eman - cipation of '' these States '' from all old-world tyrannies of the ideal , has sought to discern in the works of one American novelist or another the typical expression of a distinctly American civilization .

		But , unless all preconceptions based upon a broad survey of literature are misleading , we are forced to disallow the pleas of these over-zealous advocates , and to admit that we have not yet produced any novelist really representative of American society in the sense in which
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	is representative of French ,
Thackeray	PERSON	of English , and
Tourgue	PERSON	- nieff of Russian society .

		Original and charm - ing novelists we have , indeed , in considerable numbers , and they have filled our literary picture-gallery with successful studies of genre , and fragments of romance , and bits of quite praiseworthy realism , and fictions of character and manners in the greatest variety .

		We have also the full flower of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's genius , and may rest assured that neither the art nor the depth of '' The Scarlet Letter '' will be far sur - passed by the best of those who may rise up in the future .

		But the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	must be broader in scope , if it can not be truer in art , than this tragic idyll of Puritan
New England	LOCATION	, and so the title still seems to await its properly-authenticated claimant .

		Assuming , then , that the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	has not yet appeared , and that prophecy about it is still admissible , let us venture a few suggestions concerning its coming and its char - acter .

		We may safely say that it will not come with observation .

		It will not be heralded by the puff preliminary , nor will hosts of rival publishers struggle for possession of the man - uscript .

		When it is given to the public , we shall not be regaled with columns of ingenuous gossip about the personality and habits of the author , nor will advance extracts be scattered far and wide to whet the appetite for the whole magnum opus - It will be the book of neither the day nor the month .

		Its originality will puzzle reviewers , and , unable to fit it into any of their neat pigeon-holes , they will , for the most part , damn it with faint praise , or treat it with flippant contempt .

		We call to mind a novel published in this country about
two years ago	DATE	, which was accorded very much the sort of reception just outlined .

		If it did not exactly `` fall flat '' from the press , it at least aroused slight enthusiasm , and soon seemed to have run its course .

		Yet the position of the book in question has grown stronger from that day to this .

		With little help from the organs of pub - licity , it has steadily enlarged its circle of read - ers , and ten years from now will probably be reckoned among the noteworthy books of the quarter-century .

		We shall not name it , for it is not the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	, although it has some of the qualities which we expect will characterize that work when it appears ; but its history will help us to understand the man - ner in which that eagerly-anticipated produc - tion is likely to make its way .

		The
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	will be borne to fame by no surface ripple of fancy , but by a strong under - current of intelligent appreciation ; it will not win its readers by wholesale , but one at a time , and each new reader will act as a new centre of propagation .

		When it has at last really found and won its fit audience , it will probably become the fashion also , and its name will be upon the lips of fools , for this penalty of genius is always exacted sooner or later .

		So much for the manner of its coming : let us now ask what the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	will be like .

		Since it is to be American , it must needs reflect the democratic principle upon which American society is organized .

		It can not rely upon the artificial distinctions of the older civilizations to give variety to its charac - ters , but must fall back upon the distinctions of mind and heart that are inherent in human nature .

		In other words , it must command a deeper psychology than the European novelist needs to give interest to his book .

		Without being in any way polemical , it must be imbued with the passion of democracy , based through - out upon the stout-hearted conviction that de - mocracy is the only rational form of govern - ment , the only system of social organization that has logical finality .

		But this implicit de - mocracy which informs the book must be puri - fied from the faults and the excesses of the democratic spirit as now manifested in our national life .

		It must be a democracy that is freed from arrogance , that has substituted ideal - ism for its present dull materialism , and that has learned the lesson of reverence .

		We should say that the political motive must figure among the leading motives of the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Without being a political novel pure and simple , it must give adequate expression to an instinct in the possession of which even the Greeks did not surpass us , an
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 instinct which is in the very marrow of our bones .

		It may be to superficial seeming a novel of domestic concerns , yet it must receive color and strength from the political motive , and thereby touch one of the most responsive chords of our national consciousness .

		Its eth - ical motives must be worthy of a nation whose civilization is based upon Puritanism , and whose history is a standing testimony to the assimilative force of Puritan ideals .

		It must give to social phenomena their true ethical rating , and exalt to use
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's clas - sification '' that which one is '' above that which he possesses , or that which he appears in the popular estimation .

		It must make the reader feel how far the true aristocracy of heart and intellect overshadows all the sham aristoc - racies of wealth and of social position won by '' smartness , '' that distinctly American vice .

		It must enforce but always by implication rather than precept the
Goethean	PERSON	lesson that he alone deserves life and freedom who wins them day by day ; and the other Goethean lesson so peculiarly applicable to a country where degenerate sons so often take the place of sturdy ancestors that we must earn anew the inheri - tance left us by our fathers , if we would really possess it .

		That some such ideas as these should inform the novel that shall be a reflection of what is best and deepest in American life seems an almost inevitable deduction from our national history and circumstances .

		But the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	must be no mere setting of philosophical abstractions .

		It must , it is true , strike deep root in the soil that the centuries have prepared for our civilization , but it must at the same time be a concrete and vital pre - sentation of certain individual lives as they are lived , or conceivably might be lived , at the present day .

		Such a novel is under bonds to be an epic of individualism , for democracy , if it means anything , means la carriers ouverte aux talens , means the fullest opportunity for the development of the individual .

		Our imag - ined work must have a hero and a heroine , each a typical figure ; and it would be a fascinat - ing task to attempt their characterization in outline .

		But this task would savor of creation , and is not for the critic to assume .

		Yet we will go so far as to borrow from the poets two suggestions , one for the man , the other for the woman .

		Is it too much to say that
Emerson	PERSON	adumbrated the hero of our search when he wrote the simple lines that stand as a motto for the essay on '' Culture '' '' Can roles or tutors educate The semigod whom we await ?

		He must be musical , Tremulous , impressional , Alive to gentle influence Of landscape and of sky , And tender to the spirit touch Of man 's or maiden 's eye : But , to his native centre fast , Shall into Future fuse the Past , And the world 's flowing fates in his own mould recast . ''

		And may we not fancy our heroine to be the realization of such a type as is foreshadowed in the closing pages of Tennyson 's '' Princess , '' such a woman as shall set herself to the hero '' like perfect music unto noble words , '' yet remain as distinctly woman as he is distinctly man ?

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` INSANITY OR GENIUS '' IN CHARACTERS OP FICTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Modern scientific men are gaining those great quali - ties of style which modern literary men seem to be losing the clear presentation of thought and the hav - ing thought to present .

		Dr.
Lombroso	PERSON	's book , '' The Man of Genius , '' is as interesting as most novels and not so obscure as many poems .

		It seems indifferent what view an author may take of life or human destiny , if he is only capable of grappling greatly with great things .

		Leopardi , for example , is so filled with enthusiasm for death and annihilation that his pages throb with the assurance and exultation of immortality .

		In a minor degree , this book , in spite of the trail of tragedy from cover to cover , is tonic and uplifting .

		Nevertheless , its argument seems open to exception .

		Its essential theme the near alliance of genius and insanity is , as
Lombroso	PERSON	admits , a commonplace of the ages , and is best summed up in
Dryden	LOCATION	's couplet .

		But when Dr.
Lombroso	PERSON	goes f uther and seeks to prove that hereditary weakness , degeneration , and insanity are the predisposing causes of genius , one must ask whether these things stop short with great men . '

		T is a mad world , my masters ; and I suppose everyone is acquainted with persons who have as many oddities as
Johnson	PERSON	or as many vices as
Byron	PERSON	.

		The diseased conditions are not noticed in ordinary persons , but genius is like an illum - inated house which reveals all that is within .

		Then , too , the possession of genius widens its owner 's sphere of action .

		It gives the right of eminent domain over men and women , and power tends to insanity and crime .

		Signer Lombroso does not give us any standard of the normal man . ''

		The normal man eats and works , '' is the brief sentence in which he dismisses that inquiry .

		This is hardly as illuminative as
Diogenes	LOCATION	's lantern .

		The absolutely sound , healthy , sane man is questionably ex - istent .

		It would seem , indeed , as if the great organs of the body the brain , heart , lungs , stomach , etc. .

		were like a group of wild animals imprisoned in one cage , they may , indeed , live together in peace and harmony , but they are more likely to rise and rend and devour each other .

		It is probable that all the symptoms of melancholy , megalomania , folie du doute , and the others upon which 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Dr.
Lombroso	PERSON	relies in his diagnosis of degeneration , insanity , and genius , are present more or less in most human beings .

		It would be a delicate task to bring such an inquiry into the field of one 's acquaintance , and might provoke reprisal ; but it is open to apply Dr.
Lombroso	PERSON	's method to fictitious characters to those accepted pictures of human life which we call novels .

		Running over in my mind a list of great novels , I can hardly recall one whose dramatis personce are not char - acterized by the symptoms which Lombroso attributes to genius or insanity .

		In this point of view , ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' is the record of a lunatic asylum , the types varying from
Wilhelm	PERSON	himself a specimen of the folie du doute , or else a mattoid , a being with the ap - pearance without the reality of genius , to an example of melancholia in Mignon , of complete dementia in the harper , of characterlessness , vanity , vagabondage in the players , and of sexual abandonment in the women generally .

		Or to take `` Pride and Prejudice , ''
Darcy	PERSON	was apparently not suspected of either genius or insanity ; yet a more monumental instance of megalomania could hardly be selected from Dr.
Lombroso	PERSON	's collection ; and Mr.
Collins	PERSON	and
Lady Catherine de Burgh	ORGANIZATION	are comic variations of the same type .

		In fact , either in art or life , the only way a character can define itself is by some originality , exceptionality , or eccentricity , which must lay it open to the suspicion of the specialist .

		One comes to doubt , in the end , the methods of the specialist in every line .

		While they concentrate their attention on symptoms or types , all the rest of nature disappears or wears the livery of their theory .

		In the present case , the method and not the man is at fault .

		Signer Lombroso is modest , brilliant , learned .

		In his preface he even hints a doubt as to the value of his own investigations .

		And certainly it seems that the cata - loguing of craniums and the tabulation of thumb-marks comes to little in explanation of the cause or course of ge niu s -

		A QUESTION OF BOUNDARIES IN FICTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Venezuelan question being amicably settled , and a fresh set of resolutions launched at the Turks , is not this a fitting moment to consider the correct boundary lines between the unsurveyed domain of no-man 's - land , where an author may hunt unchallenged the small game with which he fills his bag , and those sacred purlieus , hedged in by divine sanction , within which his industry becomes unlawful poaching ?

		Has the public any rights which an author is bound to respect , and vice versa ?

		Must a good story be located in a region unknown to fame , lest its genial laugh at the common foibles of mankind be construed as a per - sonal affront by the dwellers in
South Africa	LOCATION	?

		Just what is the sesthetic distinction between allowable and slanderous adjectives ?

		When does the use of '' narrow - ness , '' for instance , become an actionable offence , call - ing for apologetic withdrawal ?

		Shall Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	and Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	satirize the traditions of Beacon Street and blue-blood in a half score of novels ; shall
Holmes	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Emerson	PERSON	, be accused of the '' narrowness of the moral '' from the very seats of the mighty , and may not an unknown weaver of tales whose insignificance is proven by the assertion that the prominent citizen has been unable to find out '' who she is '' may not this wholly irrespon - sible person venture to insinuate that there are undesir - able neighborhoods even in
South Boston	LOCATION	?

		Actually , the delightful chaperon of the '' Little Fool '' insinuated nothing , in quoting the current opinion of one suburb against another
Jamaica	LOCATION	Plain against
South Boston	LOCATION	quite in the self-gratulatory way of the
Vermont	LOCATION	countryman who pitied the inhabitant of the Hub for living '' so fur off . ''

		The satire , such as it is , seems to be entirely against the complacent residents of
Jamaica Plains	LOCATION	for their assumed superiority to the rest of the world .

		It is they who are inferentially '' narrow , '' and it would seem quite in order for them to rise and pro- test , in the name of the '' middle age of American archi - tecture '' and the '' great-aunt who had lost the use of her mind . ''

		But let them beware of demanding an apology .

		Apologies are notoriously kittle cattle to bring home , especially when acquired by the argument of the bayonet .

		May one suspect the editor of '' The Century '' of that satire of which the dwellers in
South Boston	LOCATION	object to being made '' targets , '' when he '' sin - cerely regrets that the story should have been in any way misunderstood '' ?

		The obtuseness of the human mind is always a subject of regret to the enlightened observer of his race , but why should he feel bound to apologize for it ?

		One is reminded of the ingenious phraseology by which the lawyer cleared himself of con - tempt of court : `` I am charged with saying that your honor was ignorant of law : it is true : I am sorry for it . ''

		It may be recalled that some
Cape Cod	LOCATION	folk once objected , to the extent of a lawsuit , at having greatness thrust upon them ; and the only conceivable reason why Miss
Mary E. Wilkins	PERSON	is not crushed under indignant protests is that so few of us have the ability to see our - selves as others see us .

		A
New England	LOCATION	woman , who seemed to have stepped bodily out of one of Miss Wil - kins 's sketches , and who had rambled on in the most delightful fashion with her reminiscences of '' folks she used to know down
Hilbro	PERSON	' way , '' who might have been the originals of ''
Lucinda Moss	PERSON	'' and ''
Malvina Jen	PERSON	- nings , '' insisted that such stories were false and mislead - ing , and ought to be '' kep ' out of print . ''

		HAMERTON 'S VIEW OF ART-TECHNIQUE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The extended and sympathetic review of
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	's Autobiography , in your last issue , recalled to me some correspondence I had with him a few years since ; and in one letter , headed Autun ,
France	LOCATION	,
Dec. 20 , 1890	DATE	, I find the following interesting opinion on some matters of high importance : '' I have always , for my part , regretted the extreme domination of tech - nique in the fine arts .

		The greatest intellect without it is nothing in the estimate of artists , and the most mind - less work with it is admitted into all exhibitions .

		If , however , you take up the study of art on the intellectual side , I fear it must be admitted that the intellectual interest of art is exceedingly unequal and often even wanting altogether .

		Critics often put mind into art , or suppose mind for it , when there is very little mind in it really . ''

		While Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	was not , perhaps , a genius , he was certainly a man of the highest talents , improved to the utmost ; and his clear exposition and sane criticism have been most beneficent .

		I have to acknowledge my great debt to his works , not merely for an insight into art , but for a model of a genuine , thoughtful , and can - did spirit .

		THE DIAL 321 A GERMAN LECTURE ON LITERA TURE .

		It was near the beginning of the semester , and after four months of hard work on the German lan - guage I was rejoicing in the fact that the lectures had begun .

		I had entered with enthusiasm into the courses in literature and philology , and expectation was at its highest .

		Professor Langweilig I had long known by reputation , and had already heard once .

		To-day he was to give his second lecture in the course .

		I had been in my place several minutes , when the door opened , and the Professor , followed by the famulus , entered .

		As he approached the desk , the Professor drew a few pages of notes from his pocket .

		By the time he had mounted the steps he had fastened his eyes upon his manuscript , and , beginning where he left off the day before , he spoke : '' Meine
Herren	PERSON	: There are also several other editions that might be mentioned here .

		The edition by
Lorenz	PERSON	,
Berlin	LOCATION	,
1887	DATE	, might have been a good one , but it is ren - dered entirely worthless by the omission of a comma on page 241 .

		The two English editions published respec - tively at
London	LOCATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	have been the most popular ones in
Great Britain	LOCATION	for many years .

		Neither of them , however , has a complete bibliography , and the Oxford edition omits all mention of my work along this line .

		Both of them persist in using capital letters with the proper adjectives and take certain unjustifiable liberties with the text , and are therefore thoroughly unreliable .

		There are also several American editions , but all Amer - ican books are mere translations or weak imitations of German works .

		I have examined three of these edi - tions from the
United States	LOCATION	, one from
New York	LOCATION	, one from
Boston	LOCATION	, and one from
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	, and find them of absolutely no value . ''

		I have now reviewed at some length the various editions of the piece of literature which we are going to study during this semester .

		I recommend to you as being the most accurate , showing the latest results of scholarship , and as following most scrupulously the original manuscript , the edition of
Herr	ORGANIZATION	Professor Doc - tor Furchtbar Langweilig ,
Leipzig	LOCATION	,
1891	DATE	. ''

		As to the much disputed question of the authorship of this poem I can refer but briefly here .

		I have ex - amined the original manuscripts with a great deal of care and diligently collated them one with another .

		The only other edition that is based upon a microscopic ex - amination of the texts is that by
Biedmann	LOCATION	,
Halle	PERSON	,
1878	DATE	.

		Now Biedmann used an eyepiece of only forty diame - ters with his microscope , while I used one of sixty dia - meters .

		Furthermore Biedman took no precaution to have the air in the barrel of his microscope and the lenses of the same temperature with each other and with the surrounding atmosphere ; in fact he gave no atten - tion to atmospheric conditions whatever .

		Consequently I have been able to make many improvements on the work of Biedmann and to correct some actual errors .

		After this minute examination of the text and an exhaus - tive analysis of all the facts bearing upon the subject I have come to a conclusion entirely at variance with those of former commentators .

		Briefly stated my conclusion iH this : There were three different authors who worked consecutively on the poem .

		The first , A , carried the work down to the middle of line 711 , '' * Anon out of the earth a fabric huge Rose like an ex - .

		1 The second author , B , who is usually spoken of as the author of the poem , resumed it with '' ' halation , with the sound Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet . '

		The work of C consisted in interpolating certain lines in Books IV .

		and VII. , all of which will be pointed out as we come to them .

		There is also conclusive evi - dence that in Book I .

		A received assistance from some unknown writer on four lines , and in one of these lines it is almost certain that this unknown writer received some help from an outside source .

		These writers I shall designate as Al and Al ' .

		But the whole subject of authorship will be treated fully in connection with the interpretation of the text . ''

		Now , gentlemen , before beginning to read this poem I must caution you against one very grave error .

		Many people suppose even many English-speaking people that English is a Romance language , that is , that it is a descendant of the Latin language .

		Now , while it is true that there are many words of Latin origin in English -LRB- and you will find many of them in this text -RRB- , yet it is not true that the language as a whole comes from the Latin .

		English is a Germanic language , or , as the En - glish themselves would say , a Teutonic language .

		The Germanic languages are , as you know , but one branch of the great Indo-Germanic family .

		The Indo-Germanic family is a division of the Worldo-Germanic ; and all the languages spoken in this world are but a part of the great Universo-Germanic whole . ''

		The great questions of the sources of this poem , the history of its development , the life of its principal au - thor , the social and religious conditions which influenced him , all will be reserved for special discussion in the seminary .

		I may say in passing that I have discovered an error of one hour forty-eight minutes and thirty-two seconds in the date of the author 's death , a full account of which discovery I shall publish in the next number of the ' Englische Studien . ' ''

		Now , gentlemen , let us pass to the text . '' '

		Of man 's first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree , ' etc. .

		In the first line we have two words of Romance origin , disobedience and fruit .

		Observe the negative force of the prefix dis - .

		The word fruit goes back through the French of the Latin fructus .

		In pronouncing Latin we Germans pronounce by the Roman method .

		The pro- nunciation of Latin in other countries is largely influ - enced by that of the languages spoken in those coun - tries , but in
Germany	LOCATION	we pronounce it exactly as it was pronounced in
Rome	LOCATION	in the days of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		Forbidden notice the force of the prefix for - ; it corresponds to the German ver - , Gothic fra - . ''

		At this point in Professor Langweilig 's discourse I perceived that his monotonous voice and learned lecture were having their effect upon me , and the last words that I distinctly remember were some remarks on Death in the third line .

		The sounding of the gong at the end of the hour awoke me .

		The Professor had reached the phrase , ''
Siloa	PERSON	's brook that flow 'd fast by the oracle of God , '' and I caught his last comment , `` Fast , adverb , Ger - man schnell , English rapidly '' The Professor dis - appeared .

		As we passed out the door I heard a young man remark , '' Er ist sehr interessant , '' and his comrade replied , '' Sehr geistreich . ''

		322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Books , THE BEST OF THE NAPOLEONIC MEMOIRS .

		* We are inclined to endorse the opinion of the translator of
Baron Thiebault	PERSON	's Memoirs , Mr.
Arthur John Butler	PERSON	, that the work is , all in all , the best of the crop of previously unpub - lished memoirs brought to light by the recent Napoleonic `` boom . ''

		It is at all events the freshest of them , the narrator confining himself closely to the diversified story of his own career , which is as absorbing as a novel of Dumas or Lever .

		If
Thiebault	PERSON	lacks the philosophic mind and political prestige of Pasquier , he easily sur - passes the Chancellor in wealth of incident and descriptive point and color .

		Over the rancor - ous Barras he has the advantage of being an honest man .

		Thiebault , though his later ca - reer failed to fully justify its early promise , was a distinguished soldier and man of letters .

		He was a general officer at thirty , he held im - portant military and administrative posts in
Italy	LOCATION	and the
Peninsula	LOCATION	, his '' Manual for Staff Officers '' is still prized for its lucidity , his '' Journal of the Siege of
Genoa	LOCATION	'' and his ''
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- rative of the Campaign in
Portugal	LOCATION	'' are stand - ard authorities for the events they relate .

		Thie - bault was , however , a disappointed man , and he makes no secret of it .

		One of his biog - raphers thinks that his superiority in culture and intellect to the rough soldiers of the Repub - lic and the Empire among whom he was thrown injured him by arousing jealousy ; his present editor attributes his comparative failure to '' a certain want of self-control , especially where his affections were concerned , '' which led to frequent , if mainly trivial , acts of insubordina - tion .

		He was never a persona grata in impe - rial circles .

		A well-born , well-bred man him - self , the vulgar ostentation and caprice of
Napoleon	PERSON	were distasteful to him ; and though he served the Emperor well so long as serving him meant serving
France	LOCATION	, he was never one of his adulators .

		In preparing his translation of these Mem - oirs , Mr.
Butler	PERSON	has wisely reduced the five volumes of the French original to two repro - ducing rather fully the first two volumes -LRB- which treat of the period before
1800	DATE	, and include the Revolution and the first Italian campaign -RRB- , but retaining from the last three , so far as fea - * THE MEMOIRS OF

		sible , only the scenes in which
Napoleon	PERSON	fig - ured , and those connected with the Peninsular War , in which
Thiebault	PERSON	played a great part .

		The translation closes with the final exit of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	from the political stage though the author lived till
1846	DATE	.

		Unlike
Pasquier	PERSON	and
Barras	PERSON	,
Thiebault	PERSON	was never at the centre of affairs , strictly speaking .

		Politically he was a steady though moderate Republican , an abhorrer of the selfish conserva - tism at the one extreme , as of the wild radical - ism and bloody excesses at the other .

		He desired progress , and , like the best minds of his era -LRB- always excepting
Rosseau	PERSON	, seul de son espece -RRB- , he looked forward , and not back to remote antiquity , for humanity 's Golden Age .

		But he was no `` ideologist , '' in
Napoleon	LOCATION	's sense of the term ; and like a practical man he saw that the crucial problem of the time was to prune away with cautious hand the abuses and anomalies of the Old Order , without striking the knife into its sound and vital parts .

		Such was the policy of the statesmen who swayed for a time the Constituent Assembly ; but their voices were soon lost in the roar of the gather - ing tempest .

		The stars of
Robespierre	LOCATION	,
Marat	PERSON	,
St. Just	LOCATION	,
Hebert	PERSON	, were red on the political hori - zon ; for it was written that
France	LOCATION	must be purged by fire , before temperate words could again prevail in her councils .

		Of the stormy days in
Revolutionary Paris	LOCATION	, from the arming of the populace up to the massacres of Sep - tember ,
Thiebault	PERSON	was a witness at first a sympathetic , at last a horrified one .

		His account of those events is that of an intelligent , law - abiding citizen , without extreme prepossession for either faction ; and it may hence repay free quotation .

		First a word as to the author 's early life .

		Thiebault was born at
Berlin	LOCATION	on
December 14 , 1769	DATE	, and in that city his infancy and boy - hood were passed .

		Military spectacles were rife there then as now ; and he recalls , not with unmixed admiration , the daily drills and re - views in the
Lustgarten	LOCATION	, etc. . ''

		In the city especially only recruits were assembled , and it was there that those terrible strokes with the cane , distributed with such inhuman lavishness , re - sounded on all sides .

		My father fled the place , and spectators would groan all save the '
Junker	PERSON	' subal - terns , who seemed to be in training rather for execu - tioners than soldiers .

		Young as I then was , the recol - lection of these barbarities still causes horror to me . ''

		In
1784	DATE	Thiebault 's father , noting that
Frederick	PERSON	was failing , and seeing small pros - pect of employment under his successor , decided to leave
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The journey to
Paris	LOCATION	was made
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 by private coach , and the author gives a lively account of his experiences en route .

		At
Valen	PERSON	- ciennes , where a parade was going on , he had his first view of French soldiery a very dif - ferent body just then from
Frederick	PERSON	's well - caned , well - set-up grenadiers .

		Says Thiebault : '' ... For the first time I saw officers with their hair dressed in pigeon 's - wing style , mounted on pattens to keep off the mud , and having umbrellas because it was raining a little , judge how I was astonished , nay , scan - dalized , when I compared this spectacle with that to which I was accustomed in the Prussian army , so severe in its bearing and so military to the smallest details . ''


Paris	LOCATION	was reached on the fifth of
December	DATE	, the author being thus nearly fourteen when he came finally to the city which was to be at least his domicile for the rest of his life .

		His expe - riences for the next four years , up to the dawn of the new time in '89 which ripened youth and rejuvenated age , were those of most young men of his years and degree ; and his account of them furnishes a sprightly sketch of the man - ners of the era .

		One day at
Versailles	LOCATION	he saw
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, who seems to have impressed him , on this occasion as on a subsequent one , as a mere boor , and a surly , ill-conditioned one at that , fitter to carry a hod than to rule a state . ''

		As he passed in front of me one day on his way to hunt , he stopped to laugh with one of the noblemen who accompanied him ; but his laugh was so loud and coarse that it was more like that of a tipsy farmer than of a monarch ... The Queen , whom I saw returning from Mass , had more nobility in her manner , and , above all , more dignity .

		But a white cotton gown , quite plain and by no means fresh , was not the dress in which a Queen of
France	LOCATION	should have shown herself in public .

		... But what did more shock me , nay , disgust me , were the remarks made quite aloud in the
State	ORGANIZATION	apartments by some of the pages , the gentlemen of the guard , and some young nobles .

		Unseemliness reached the point of outrage . ''

		Thiebault saw
Louis	LOCATION	again a year or two later -LRB- the
Bastille	LOCATION	had then fallen and Mail - lard 's Amazons had conducted '' the baker , the bakeress , and the baker 's boy '' back to '' his faithful city of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -RRB- , this time taking the air in the early morning on the Tuileries ter - races . ''

		Just then a lady came through the gate .

		She had a pretty little spaniel with her , which , before she no - ticed it , ran close up to the
King	LOCATION	.

		Making a low cour - tesy , she called the dog back in haste ; but as it turned to run to its mistress , the
King	PERSON	, who had a large cane in his hand , broke its back with a blow of his cudgel .

		Then , amid the screams and tears of the lady , and as the poor little beast was breathing its last , the
King	PERSON	, delighted with his exploit , continued his walk , slouching rather more than usual , and laughing like any lout of a peasant . ''

		Could that have been the amiable , if inept ,
Louis	LOCATION	whom we seem to know so well , the '' good , easy man '' and well-meaning monarch , the passive martyr and scapegoat of French royalty depicted by compassionate history ?

		Is it not perhaps the real
Louis	PERSON	-LRB- manifest for an instant under the flash-light of a hard fact -RRB- , the nation 's brutish '' gros pore '' whom the mob jeered at as he struggled under the hands of
Samson	LOCATION	on the scaffold in the Place de la Con - corde ?

		Maybe the popular instinct was more than half right as to
Louis	LOCATION	, and -LRB- as Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	thinks -RRB- as to
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	as well .

		Thiebault undoubtedly relates what he saw ; and the brutal act recorded by him is quite in keeping with the wanton slashes of the whip -LRB- so unlike the paternal cuts of old
Friedrich Wilhelm	PERSON	's rattan -RRB- bestowed by the '' Son of Saint Louis '' on the luckless priest or rustic who chanced to cross his path while hunting .

		The good Archbishop of
Cambrai	LOCATION	, who knew his man , once observed in company , on some - body 's remarking that the
King	PERSON	's kindness was '' depicted on his face , '' that it was '' a fortu - nate mask . ''

		Once more the author saw
Louis	LOCATION	, this time on his reentry into
Paris	LOCATION	after the flight to
Varennes	LOCATION	.

		He says : `` The picture is always with me : I can still see on the back seat of the first of the two carriages
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		on the left , bareheaded , with Barnave beside him , while
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, on the right , held the
Dauphin	LOCATION	on her knees , and seemed to be showing him to the crowd as they passed through it to a palace that could in future only be a prison , and was in truth for them the anteroom to the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	and the Conciergerie . ''

		Of the opening events of the Eevolution the emeute of
July 13	DATE	, the fall of the
Bastille	LOCATION	, the arming of the people at the Invalides , and the spontaneous formation of the civic soldiery
Thiebault	PERSON	gives a rapid and graphic sketch .

		When the rioting began he joined the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	, Feuillants battalion , and was given a small temporary command .

		On the
evening	TIME	of
July 15	DATE	he headed a detachment sent to
Passy	PERSON	to reconnoitre the approaches on that side of
Paris	LOCATION	; and on this occasion he was en - trusted officially with a letter from 1 ; he great Mirabeau , duly countersigned and sent by ex - press from
Versailles	LOCATION	, which he was to deliver at a certain house at Chaillot .

		The national crisis was serious .


Paris	LOCATION	was in insurrection ;
Bouille	LOCATION	, with the foreign troops , was hovering over her , like a hawk poised for the fatal swoop ; the clang of the tocsin and the roll of the drum hourly called the bourgeois from bed and counter to the ranks ;
Saint Antoine	PERSON	was up in rags and what arms it could improvise or steal ; King Mob , long dethroned , was clearly coming to his own again ; society seemed fast 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, lapsing into chaos , and the young soldier nat - urally supposed that the missive of the great deputy and champion of the
Third Estate	ORGANIZATION	was a document of importance .

		He proceeded cau - tiously on his way toward
Passy	PERSON	, throwing out pickets as he advanced ; reached the house at Chaillot ; halted his men ; and delivered the letter .

		Judge of his surprise and chagrin when he discovered that the supposed state paper was only a billet doux to one of
M. de Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's mistresses !

		Thiebault with his four hundred men had been used to ensure the safe delivery of a note to a strumpet .

		He says : '' I excused the fair lady from giving the receipt re - quired , declined the glass of wine which she offered me , drily ordered my lieutenant to return to his post , and , confining myself to a tone of cold politeness , left that merry company and continued my reconnoissance ... Some complaints of the office which
M. de Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	had made me perform naturally entered into my report and could not fail to enliven it . ''

		Thiebault witnessed the arrival of the Mar - seillese at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Let us view that famous band through the eyes of a contemporary who had no special interest either in defaming or in ex - tolling it . ''

		On
July	DATE	30th those hideous Federals * spewed forth by
Marseilles	LOCATION	arrived at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This invasion of brig - ands , which in
March 1815	DATE
the Court of Louis XVIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		renewed in its own interest under the name of Ven - deans , definitely let loose the rabble and crime .

		I do not think anything more horrible can be imagined than those 500 madmen , three-quarters drunk , almost all in red caps , bare-armed and bare-chested , followed by the dregs of the people , incessantly reinforced by the over - flow of the Faubourgs of Saint-Antoine and
Saint	PERSON	-
Marceau	PERSON	, fraternizing from one grog-shop to another with bands no less dreadful than their own . ''

		On
August 10	DATE	,
Thiebault	PERSON	was on duty at the Feuillants , charged by the Assembly with the protection of the prisoners from the fury of the mob .

		His temporary success -LRB- the prisoners were finally murdered to a man , and he '' heard the crash of their corpses as they were hurled from the garret windows into the court below '' -RRB- led to a highly dramatic scene .

		`` Feeling sure that to gain time was everything , I was already congratulating myself on the result of my efforts , when a woman appeared in the courtyard wear - ing a black felt hat with a plume of the same color , dressed in a blue riding-habit , with a pair of pistols and a dagger in her belt .

		She was a dark girl of about twenty , and , with a sort of shudder I say it , very pretty , made still more beautiful by her excitement .

		Preceded and followed by a number of maniacs , she cleft her way through the crowd , crying , ' Make room !

		Make room ! '

		* Later on , in recounting his march with the
Republican Army	ORGANIZATION	to the front , Thie ` bault styles this order of levies '' These scoundrels , who afterwards distinguished themselves by want of discipline , pillaging and cowardice , until the epithet ' F6d - trk ' became an insult that no soldier forgave . ''

		went straight to the other gun and leaped upon it .

		She was , as I learnt ,
Mile	LOCATION	.

		Thdroigue de Me * ricourt .

		As long as I live that creature will be present before my eyes ; the sound of her voice will ring in my ears as she uttered the first sentence of her discourse . '

		How long , ' she shrieked , ' will you let yourself be misled by empty phrases ? ' '

		Naturally ,
Mile	LOCATION	.

		Theroigne 's harrangue pre - vailed .

		Thiebault was quickly hustled back into the guard-room , from which coign of van - tage he presently heard himself unanimously condemned to death by an improvised tribunal , the Mericourt presiding .

		He concludes : `` I never saw her again after that day ; but , though I am as susceptible as most men to the influence of women , I certainly never met another woman who in half-an-hour could have left on my mind a recollection of her which a thousand years would not weaken . ''

		During the domiciliary visits which preluded the
September	DATE	massacres ,
Thiebault	PERSON	narrowly escaped arrest as a suspect , which of course meant death at the hands of the paid butchers of the Commune at the Abbaye or at
La Force	ORGANIZATION	.


Thiebault	PERSON	did not himself see the massacres ; but he had some details from a young friend who did ,
M. de la Roserie	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter went first to the
Carmelites	LOCATION	' , where the slaughter of the priests was going on .

		Here two facts par - ticularly struck him : '' The first was that half the assassins employed there were wearing the uniforms of the
National Guards	ORGANIZATION	, that they began their work with the bayonet , and that they wiped their weapons dripping with blood on the leaves of some shrubs near the gate . ''

		The second fact is instructive as helping to explain why respectable
Paris	LOCATION	stood aside , and looked on with seeming apathy -LRB- very much as
Christian Europe	LOCATION	looks on to-day at the Turk -RRB- while this comparative handful of ruffians for five days carried on their work . ''

		A man of middle age , whose face , manner , and tone were entirely calculated to inspire belief in his kindness , returning from his walk , with two young daughters going in front and his wife on his arm , passed near M. de la Roserie .

		They had no doubt just heard of the horrors which were going on at the Carmelites ' , and which , indeed , the frightful cries only too plainly re - vealed ; their faces showed great emotion , and yet the head of the family said to his wife with entire convic - tion , ' No doubt it is as sad as it can be , but these are implacable enemies , and those who are ridding the coun - try of them are saving your life and our poor children 's lives . ' ''

		Of the murderers at
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, de la Roserie states that , despite the great crowd of citizens surrounding them , they went about their work with the utmost tranquillity : '' It would seem that they were some picked men of
Maillard	ORGANIZATION	's band of 300 , armed with long stakes trimmed so as to form clubs they were in truth the ' sloggers '
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL that they were called .

		Five stood on either side of the door of egress , hidden by the wall ; as soon as the sounds announced that it was going to be opened they raised their bludgeons , and the moment one of the vic - tims came through the fatal door he fell with a smashed skull , and was dragged off by the cleaners-up . ''

		Thiebault concludes : '' The original authors of those domiciliary visits ... were
Danton	PERSON	and
Marat	PERSON	; but the hero of the atrocities , whose memory will ever be branded by the horror of mankind , was Billaud-Varennes .

		Hurry ing from prison to prison , wading in blood , he said at one place , ' People , you are sacrificing your enemies and doing your duty ' ; at another , ' Bring wine for the brave toilers who are delivering the nation from its foes . '

		Finally he had 24 livres paid to each of
Maillard	ORGANIZATION	's < sloggers . ' ''

		Such scenes enacted ,
Thiebault	PERSON	felt that he had '' supped full of horrors '' ; and , shaking the blood-polluted dust of
Paris	LOCATION	from his feet , he started for the front a simple grenadier in a marching regiment .

		From this point on , his story is largely that of the professional sol - dier , and well repays reading .

		The volumes are well made , and contain several portraits , together with plans of Austerlitz and of old
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Lying just south of the tropic , its climate is warm but modulated by the breezes of the ocean and the gulf .

		Its mountains and valleys are clothed with perennial verdure that responds luxuriantly to abundant moisture and a stimu - lating sun .

Cuba	LOCATION	is by nature an earthly par - adise , fitly named '' the Pearl of the Antilles , '' the rarest and the richest jewel in the diadem of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Except Hispaniola , occupied but a few years earlier ,
Cuba	LOCATION	was the first land in the new world to be colonized from the old .

		In the con - dition of a colony , without autonymous exist - ence , she has remained to the present day .

		Nearly an hundred years elapsed between the founding of
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	by
Velasquez	PERSON	and the settlements of
Jamestown	LOCATION	and Ply - mouth .

		It was from
Cuba	LOCATION	that
Cortez	PERSON	departed for his diabolical campaign against
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		It was from
Cuba	LOCATION	that
Fernando de Soto	PERSON	set forth to find , not the fountain of youth which he sought , but the magnificent stream of the Mis - sissippi and an unrestful grave .

		But the settlers from
England	LOCATION	came to
America	LOCATION	to plant homes , and , as the sequel shows , to found a great re - public .

		The adventurers from
Spain	LOCATION	came to gather wealth which they did not expect to enjoy without returning to the mother-land .

		Even the government did not view the colony as a child whose young life should be nurtured for what its manhood might develop , but only as a source which might yield revenue for the crown and wealth for the subject .

		But in those days
Spain	LOCATION	had frequent wars with her European neighbors , and in all such wars remote colonies were especially vulner - able .

		It was vastly safer to send a marauding squadron down the Spanish Main than to sail a fleet along the English Channel .

		There was more opportunity for surprise , and a better chance for getting away with booty .

		Many a stately galleon , freighted with the wealth with - drawn from the Spanish colonies , became the prey of English or French ships of war , or of the wily buccaneer , who was either or neither as suited his convenience , but always an enemy of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		In such warfare , the attack , if not easily parried , is easily returned ; and so it fell out that La Habana , the chief Cuban seaport , was twice destroyed by the French and once taken by the English , and after each reverse was returned to Spanish authority .

		For generations the life of the Cuban was secluded and eventless .

		He had little education .

		He manufactured only such things as could be made rudely , on his own estate , to supply his own wants .

		He had no commerce , for his spacious harbors were sealed to all but Spanish ships , and
Spain	LOCATION	herself could take only a moiety of such things as he had to sell .

		The 326 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, restrictive policy of the mother country is illus - trated by the following : `` During the years from
1726	DATE	to
1796	DATE	, a great navy yard grew up on the bay of
Habana	LOCATION	, and 114 war ves - sels were built there to convoy the Spanish treasure ships .

		But the yard was closed , at the date last named , on the demand of the ship-builders of
Spain	LOCATION	that the work should be done in the mother country . ''

		A period of prosperity followed the restora - tion of Habana by the English in
1763	DATE	.

		Trade was developed , especially with the neighboring
United States	LOCATION	, and the culture of sugar began to furnish an important staple of commerce .

		The negroes were induced to refrain from imi - tating the uprising of their race in
Hispaniola	LOCATION	.

		In
1808	DATE	the Bourbons were deposed by
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon from the Spanish throne .

		In
1810	DATE	revo - lutionary movements began in all the Spanish dependencies upon the American continent , and in a few years those countries had freed them - selves from allegiance to the Spanish crown .

		During all these calamitous times
Cuba	LOCATION	re - mained faithful to Spanish rule , earning for herself the title of '' The ever-faithful isle . ''

		Notwithstanding this , the authority then and since formally conferred by the home govern - ment upon the Captains-general sent to govern the island has been most autocratic and arbi - trary , including all the unusual powers `` granted to the governors of besieged cities . ''

		Is it sur - prising that a continued policy of suppression should have been followed by a leaven of un - rest , constantly developing into insurrection ?

		Since
1823	DATE	no less than ten demonstrations , more or less important , including the long struggle between
1868	DATE	and
1878	DATE	and that now going forward , have raised the standard of Cuban independence .

		Some of these move - ments were initiated within the island ; some were organized without ; but all rested upon the deeply rooted dissatisfaction with Spanish rule as administered .

		The careful observer readily discovers that these movements have not been inspired by a merely sentimental desire for independence .

		Until alienated by the long oppression of offi - cial misrule , the Cuban sentiment faithfully cherished a close and filial union with the mother-land .

		But even filial affection can not survive a long series of grievances and unjust exactions .

		Some of the evils to which the Cuban objects are these : He has been compelled to pay a large , increas - ing , and unreasonable annual tribute to the mother-country .


Spain	LOCATION	is poor , and is stagger - ing beneath a debt so great that payment even of interest involves a most grievous burden of taxation .


Cuba	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	's richest resource , is required not only to bear the expense of her own insular administration , but annually to turn over to
Spain	LOCATION	a constantly increasing sur - plus .

		The revenue of the island in
1857	DATE	was
eighteen millions of dollars	MONEY	; in
1868	DATE	, twenty - six millions , while the sum demanded of her was over forty millions .

		It was stated in the
Spanish Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1891	DATE	that the debt of
Cuba	LOCATION	was , in
1864	DATE	, three
millions of dollars	MONEY	, and that in
1891	DATE	it had become one hundred and seventy - five millions , not for anything that
Cuba	LOCATION	had done or suffered , but for expenses incurred by
Spain	LOCATION	herself in wars with
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	, and
Mexico	LOCATION	, in which
Cuba	LOCATION	had no imme - diate concern .

		At the same time , the national debt was twelve hundred and eleven millions , for which
Spain	LOCATION	was paying annually fifty-six and three-fourths millions , and
Cuba	LOCATION	ten and a half millions .

		The inequality is yet more glar - ing when we find that for
$ 3.22	MONEY	per capita paid by Spaniards
$ 6.39	MONEY	per capita was paid by Cubans .

		In the collection of this money the Cuban is compelled to pay heavy differential duties upon merchandise not imported from
Spain	LOCATION	.

		For ex - ample , when a barrel of flour , sent from
New York	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	and there '' naturalized , '' would be delivered in
Habana	LOCATION	for
$ 8.75	MONEY	, if shipped direct its cost would be
$ 10.40	MONEY	.

		At the same time heavy duties are imposed upon Cuban pro- ducts sent to
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The excise and the duty upon Cuban tobacco have been so great as to cause
Spain	LOCATION	to take nearly three-fourths of its supply of tobacco from other countries .

		But the duties and other taxes are not hon - estly collected .

		Between the government and the taxpayer lies the official , whose purpose and practice is to squeeze from the payer a sum for himself which may be as much as
twenty-five per cent	MONEY	in addition to what must go forward to the government , if not intercepted by defal - cation .

		This corruption is well known .

		In the custom house at
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	it is said to have absorbed as much as seventy per cent of the entire receipts .

		In
1891	DATE	the defalcations in the government of Habana were reported in the Congresso de Diputados , or
Congress of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	, at
Madrid	LOCATION	as amounting to nearly
twenty-three millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		In the
spring of 1895	DATE	it was alleged that the custom-house frauds in
Cuba	LOCATION	since
1878	DATE	aggregated more than
one hundred millions of dollars	MONEY	.

Habana	LOCATION	and
Santiago	LOCATION	de
Cuba	LOCATION	three times , that sum .

		All salaries , secular and eccle - siastic , are fixed at
Madrid	LOCATION	, not in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Ex - cept in rare and subordinate instances , the incumbents are Spaniards , fortunate friends of the home ministry , sent to the island as to a conquered and prostrate province , to enjoy the opportunity of quickly amassing a fortune .

		While the Cuban charges these evils to un - just administrative methods perpetuated by the mother-country , he is confronted with condi - tions , discouraging indeed , for which no gov - ernment can be made directly accountable .

		They result from the changing currents of trade caused by the world 's march in invention and the competition of new industries developed in other lands .

		They become a factor in the Cuban 's difficulties because they cause a shrink - age in his resources .

		The chief commercial staples of
Cuba	LOCATION	are sugar and tobacco .

		Within a brief period the world 's production of sugar has been enor - mously increased .

		Of the product of
1894	DATE	over eight millions of tons , of which one mil - lion tons was surplus more than half was pro- duced from the beet .

		The supremacy of the cane , and of
Cuba	LOCATION	, was overthrown .

		To meet the sharp competition ,
Cuba	LOCATION	had increased the area of culture , had availed herself of improved methods of extraction , and had been compelled to concede a great reduction in price .

		The out - put of Cuban sugar had grown from 490,000 tons in
1880	DATE	to 1,080,000 tons in
1893	DATE	; dur - ing the same time the price of raw sugar Ccen - trif ugals -RRB- had fallen from
$ 158	MONEY	to
$ 74	MONEY	per ton , while the total annual return was in either case not far from
eighty millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		Since then , both the output and the price have seri - ously diminished .

		Thus , it appears that within the last fifteen years the returns for capital and labor employed in
Cuba	LOCATION	in the production of sugar have been reduced about half .

		In like manner , the receipts from exported cigars fell in six years from
ten millions of dollars	MONEY	in
1889	DATE	to five and a third millions in
1894	DATE	.

		Until the removal , quite lately , of the duty on sugar , the Spanish government has collected an export duty on both sugar and tobacco .

		The excellent and timely volume before us , by Lieutenant
Rowan	PERSON	,
U.S.N.	LOCATION	, and Professor
Ramsay	PERSON	, of the
Columbian University	ORGANIZATION	, presents a clear and judicial account of
Cuba	LOCATION	and its history , evidently the result of careful and impartial investigation .

		The conditions which they have described and the opinions reported as held by intelligent Cubans lead naturally to restlessness , remonstrance , and revolt .


Provo	LOCATION	- cations less aggravated led the Anglo-American colonies to assert their independence , and the Spanish colonies on the continent to imitate their example .

		The sympathies of the people of the
United States	LOCATION	flow perennially toward any race or people which struggles for freedom or autonomy .

		The interests of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	would be better served by the presence in
Cuba	LOCATION	of a people peaceful , happy , self - governing , and prosperous , than of a populace enslaved , impoverished , and in revolt .

		It is certain that these are the opinions of many in our country who are not prepared to assert that the acquisition of
Cuba	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	is desirable even if it were possible .

		The earlier demonstrations against Spanish authority were only sporadic movements , symp - toms of fever which yielded to the prompt administration of a self - protecting government .

		The first genuine attempt of the Cuban people to acquire a national existence began in Octo - ber ,
1868	DATE	, with a declaration of independence made under the leadership of
Carlos M. de Cespedes	PERSON	, who was soon supported by fifteen thousand men , more formidable for ardor than for arms .

		In
April , 1869	DATE	, a constitution was promulgated providing the usual forms of republican government , and an election was held .

		It is admitted that a greater part of the native and influential Cubans were in sympathy with the insurrection .

		The forces in the field were badly armed and poorly supplied .

		The Spanish gunboats patrolled the coast to pre - vent assistance from without , while the Spanish troops were equipped with the most effective munitions of war .

		In
1869	DATE	the insurgents were recognized as belligerents by several of the Central American States , but by none of the greater powers .

		In
1871	DATE	the contingent operating in central
Cuba	LOCATION	received favorable terms of surrender and laid down their arms .

		From then to 1878 a desultory warfare was carried on to little purpose on either side .

		The advantage to the Spanish troops in or - ganization , arms , and supplies was neutralized by the nature of the country in the theatre of action , where mountain fastnesses everywhere aided the wiles of the guerrilla , and by the disease-laden climate , fatal to the unacclimated Spanish levies .

		In
February , 1878	DATE	, the peace offered by
Captain-General Martinez de Cam	ORGANIZATION	- 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, pos , with pardon to all who had taken part in the revolutionary movement , was accepted , and the war was closed .

		While this disposition was made of the forces that had actually borne arms , it is asserted that important reforms were promised to the Cuban people , as to the admin - istration of the island and the removal of the abuses which had been the sources of disaffec - tion .

		It is further asserted that these reforms were not instituted as promised , and that the abuses were continued without mitigation .

		In
February , 1895	DATE	, a second insurrection began .

		The first demonstration was made by some twenty-four persons in the province of
Matanzas	LOCATION	, acting in concert with other Cubans dwelling in the island or in exile without .

		The organizer was
Jose Marti	PERSON	, then in
New York	LOCATION	, who was afterwards joined in
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	by
Maximo Gomez	PERSON	, and with other leaders arrived in
Cuba	LOCATION	in
May	DATE	, when the conflict was fully arrayed .

		Marti was killed in battle ,
May 19	DATE	, and
Gomez	PERSON	became the chief in command .

		The full significance of the uprising was not at first appreciated , because of the small number of insurgents in view ; but when its strength was recognized , General
Campos	PERSON	, who by nego - tiation had ended the preceding conflict , was despatched from
Spain	LOCATION	to command the royal forces .

		His management of the campaign did not secure promptly the results expected at
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		He was recalled in
January , 1896	DATE	, and General
Weyler	PERSON	was sent to succeed him , and is now in command .

		The war or must we say the revolt ?

		has been in progress twenty months .

		By
March last	DATE	,
Spain	LOCATION	had sent to
Cuba	LOCATION	121,000 men , in addition to 19,000 garrisoned on the island when hostilities began .

		Constant reinforce - ments have followed , so that the effective strength of the Spanish army in
Cuba	LOCATION	is re - ported to exceed 200,000 men , splendidly drilled and equipped , a large proportion being veteran troops .

		General
Weyler	PERSON	has also under his command a force of volunteers estimated at 50,000 , a
coast guard	ORGANIZATION	, and a cordon of war - ships and gunboats patrolling the coast .

		The revolutionary forces are not so easily es - timated .

		* They are supposed to number 50,000 men bearing firearms , with 25,000 more '' mach - * Definite statements as to the population of
Cuba	LOCATION	can not now be made , as the last census was taken in
1887	DATE	, when the total was 1,631,687 .

		The following are estimates for
1894	DATE	: Spaniards , or '' peninsulars '' 258,000 Cubans of Spanish descent 1,000,000 Cubans of other white or Asiatic blood 38,000 Cubans of African blood , pure or mixed ... 431,000 Total Cubans , or '' insulars '' 1,469,000 Total estimated population ,
1894	DATE	1,727,000 eteros . ''

		They have lacked many things usually deemed indispensable to efficient warfare .

		Their base of action has been the mountain fastness ; for food , they have foraged as they went ; for arms , ammunition , and medicines , they have depended on what their coadjutors in other lands have sent by swift steamers that could elude the watchfulness of the patrolling fleet , or what they could themselves take from their enemy .

		They are said to be now fairly well supplied with small arms of improved pat - tern , and with corresponding ammunition ; with a small equipment of artillery ; with dynamite guns , nitro-gelatine , and stick dynamite .

		They are without horses , which is a serious deficiency .

		Hitherto the insurgents seem to have ar - ranged the fighting to suit their own conven - ience .

		They have been ubiquitous , swift , and elusive .

		They have avoided pitched battles with superior numbers .

		They appear suddenly where least expected , overcome whatever small garrison may be found , ravage cane-fields and sugar-mills with fire , dynamite , and the mach - ete , and vanish .

		The real object of such attack is the Spanish exchequer .

		The destruction of the chief article of export means not merely a loss of export duties , but a corresponding diminution of imports and of the imposts thereon .

		It dries a stream which , flowing into the Spanish treasury , would in part replace the sums withdrawn to meet the expenses of the war .

		The Cubans have utilized the delays of the rainy season by planning a civil government , and where possible putting it in action .

		They have seen that , while claiming the recognition of foreign nations , they must provide for recog - nition something more than an army struggling in the field .

		A president ,
Senor Betancourt	PERSON	, has been chosen , and cabinet officers have been appointed .


Maximo Gomez y Baez	PERSON	is the general-in-chief ;
Antonio Maceo	PERSON	, lieutenant - general .

		The island has been divided into states , districts , and prefecturas .

		Provision has been made for the collection of taxes , for estab - lishing roads , and for regulating marriages ; for better supplies of food for fighters and their families , and better care for the wounded .

		The next campaign will soon open , and the struggle will be severe and probably decisive .

		Neither party can endure defeat .

		It is not possible to predict the outcome , farther than to observe that the Cubans are contending against fearful odds .

		It is certain that the sympathy of the larger part of the American people is with them .

		THE DIAL THE IJTERARY CIRCLE OF THE BRONTES .

		* ''
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	and her Circle '' is a new collection of the
Bronte	PERSON	correspondence , ar - ranged and commented on by Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	.

		The collection is as complete as Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	could make it , the greater part of the volume being made up of entirely new material .

		The editor has arranged this correspondence in chapters in such a way as to tell the life-story of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and her connection with her more intimate friends .

		He has shown so much discernment and discrimination in the execution of his plan that one dislikes to urge any objections to the plan itself .

		But I think it has some defects .

		This division of letters into chapters , for example , does not give as clear an idea of the development of
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's character as might be had from a strictly chronological arrangement .

		Then , too , as the letters are arranged according to their contents , occasional difficulties arise in classi - fying them , particularly when a single letter contains important matter regarding two or more members of the Bronte circle , which can - not be wholly overcome by cross-references and foot-notes .

		Thus , some part of the interest that should belong to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	herself is dispersed among her friends .

		In spite of these strictures , however , the book contains so much new material that it forms an important contribution to
Bronte	LOCATION	literature .

		The work should be of interest , also , to all students of that transitional period of English fiction of which
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	is perhaps the most modern representative .

		The circle of friends that gathered about
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, to which so much of the present volume is devoted , was of exceeding small compass when compared with other lit - erary circles of this and preceding centuries .

		It included nothing of the talent and genius which assembled about
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, and of which he and others of the impressionists wrote so pleasantly ; or about
Coleridge	PERSON	, to listen to those wonderful monologues ; or even about our own
Longfellow	LOCATION	, when that poet was trans - lating the '' Divina Commedia . ''

		These are charming chapters in the gossipping history of English letters .

		They suggest potent forces that have been , and perhaps are , at work in the development of literature , whose influence will last as long as literature itself .

		The greater part of what was thought and said at these *

Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	.

		With portraits .

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		gatherings can never be reproduced in any tan - gible form .

		Hazlitt attempted to reproduce one of the talks at the Lambs ' in his essay '' Of Persons one would wish to have seen , '' and with all his charm as an essayist he merely succeeded in suggesting to his readers how much he had omitted .

		In her own way , but to a less degree than any of these ,
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	exerted an influence on those who met her and afterwards wrote to her .

		Many of these friends are no longer remembered .

		Outside of the members of her own family , all of whom had some talent for writing and one something very like genius , the intimate members of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's circle were
Ellen Nussey	PERSON	,
Mary Taylor	PERSON	, Mar - garet
Wooler	PERSON	, and
W. S. Williams	PERSON	.

		Friend - ships which did not ripen into intimacy were those with
Miss Martineau	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		One of the most interesting of this circle was
Charlotte	LOCATION	's own sister ,
Emily	PERSON	, the member of the
Bronte	PERSON	family who came nearest to pos - sessing genius .

		Of her real character we know very little ; but from a hint here and there in the
Bronte	LOCATION	correspondence , in her own poems , and in ''
Wurthering Heights	LOCATION	, '' we gather that she was very eccentric in manner , that her ideas were theoretical rather than practical , and that she was characterized by an impenetrable reserve suggestive of great moral strength and much latent power .

		One of her friends de - scribes her as being '' intensely lovable . '' ''

		One of her rare expressive looks , '' writes this same friend , '' was something to remember through life , there was such a depth of soul and feeling , and yet a shyness of revealing herself a strength of self-containment seen in no other .

		She was in the strictest sense a law unto her - self , and a heroine in keeping that law . ''

		Her death was marked by the same spirit of cour - age and endurance which pervades her poem , '' The Old Stoic '' ; it was a relentless conflict , says
Charlotte	LOCATION	, between a fragile frame and a strangely strong spirit .

		In her life we are told that she loved the moors and found her dearest delights in the bleakest of solitudes . ''

		Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her ; out of a sullen hollow in a livid hill-side her mind could make an Eden , '' writes her sister , and she adds that above all things else she loved liberty .

		It is this spirit of liberty which is present in her '' Last Lines , '' and it is this intense personality which fills her best poems , and has left its mark on '' Wur - thering Heights , '' that rude , rustic production , where it is accompanied by a weird power , and 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is brooded over by a spirit almost sombre enough to be worthy of the gloomy pencil of a Rembrandt .

		To all this , the plain personality of
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	presents a striking contrast .

		Her let - ters reveal a pure and blameless character , but one so simple , so unassuming , and so common - place , as to be unattractive .

		Now from a woman possessing these qualities , brilliant letters are hardly to be expected ; for to be a thoroughly good letter-writer one must have a certain Shandian disregard for form enough at least to free one 's self from cold conventionality .


Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, in spite of a seeming and even professed frankness , could not overcome the self-imposed restraint that characterizes her letters , nor with her remarkable talent could she free them from the commonplaces of an uneventful life .

		Her letters contain some critical opinions , however , which are worth quoting , because they show that at times her mind was keenly incis - ive , although her education , her reading , and her travels were not extensive enough to give her that breadth of view so essential to the critic .

		These are , for the most part , judgments of her contemporaries .

		Emerson 's essays she read with interest and admiration , but she found the gold mixed with clay .

		She said
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's writings resembled sunshine in their brightness and tranquillity .

		She admired the noble manliness of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, but disliked his style and often differed from his way of think - ing .

		She was pleased with
Ruskin	PERSON	because of the beauty and energy of his style , and because he himself was such a hearty admirer .

		She thought Goethe '' clear , deep , but very cold '' ; and in one letter she writes of him as '' great , powerful , giant - souled , but also profoundly ego - tistical . ''

		She placed
Thackeray	PERSON	above all her contemporaries ; but while she bowed before his shrine with an almost blind hero-worship , she was not unconscious of his faults .

		She came to the conclusion that '' whenever he writes , Mephistopheles stands on his right hand and
Raphael	PERSON	on his left ; the great doubter and sneerer usually guides his pen , the Angel , noble and gentle , interlines letters of light here and there . ''

		What she writes of
Jane Austen	PERSON	is worth reprinting because it is the criticism of one great woman by another : '' I have likewise read one of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's works 'Em ma ' read it with interest and with just the de - gree of admiration which Miss
Austen	PERSON	herself would have thought sensible and suitable .

		Anything like warmth or enthusiasm anything energetic , poignant , heartfelt is utterly out of place in commending these works : all such demonstration the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer , would have calmly scorned as outrd and extravagant .

		She does her business of delineating the surface of the lines of genteel English people curiously well .

		There is a Chinese fidelity , a miniature delicacy , in the painting .

		She ruffles her reader by nothing vehement , disturbs him by nothing profound .

		The passions are perfectly unknown to her ; she rejects even a speaking acquaintance with that stormy sisterhood .

		Even to the feelings she vouchsafes no more than an occasional graceful but distant recog - nition too frequent converse with them would ruffle the smooth elegance of her progress .

		Her business is not half so much with the human heart as with the hu - man eyes , month , hands , and feet .

		What sees keenly , speaks aptly , moves flexibly , it suits her to study ; but what throbs fast and full , though hidden , what the blood rushes through , what is the unseen seat of life and the sentient target of death , this Miss
Austen	PERSON	ignores .

		She no more , with her mind 's eye , beholds the heart of her race than each man , with bodily vision , sees the heart in his heaving breast .


Jane Austen	PERSON	was a complete and most sensible lady , but a very incomplete and rather insensible -LRB- not senseless -RRB- woman . ''

		As a novelist
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	seems to have realized some of her limitations .

		In her letters she frequently laments her small knowledge of the world , which neither capacity nor circum - stance would permit her to widen .

		This , she claimed , prevented her from giving that import - ance and variety to her writings which were to be met with in the work of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thack	PERSON	- eray .

		She did not realize that
Jane Austen	PERSON	-LRB- whom she could by no means appreciate -RRB- , laboring under the same disadvantages , had produced far greater results with material as scanty as her own .

		The truth is that
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	possessed talent but not genius .

		Fur - thermore , her conception of art was wrong .

		Of a certain character she wrote : '' It is very masterly , because it is very true . ''

		She relied too much on autobiographical material , and therefore failed to idealize her characters suf - ficiently .

		She confessed that the
Lowood	LOCATION	scenes in ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' were '' merely photographed from life , '' and by this plea sought to justify them as fiction .

		She might have said the same thing , with equal truth , of the greater part of `` The Professor , '' ``
Shirley	PERSON	, '' or '' Yilette . ''

		Beyond what was evidently autobiographical , she created only one character of any great im - portance Mr.
Rochester	PERSON	of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. ''

		Upon the creation of this character , and upon the fact that she anticipated some phases of the modern novel , rests her fame as a novelist .

		THE DIAL 331 A PANORAMIC HISTORY OF THE QUARTER-CENTURY .

		* The public is always ready to hear what President
Andrews	PERSON	may have to say on history , philosophy , economics , school management , or any of the long list of subjects which he keeps upon his mental shelves ; but that personality of his which has been so prominent a factor in any estimate of his prior work must be elimi - nated in the case of his latest one , unless , indeed , the words '' compiled by '' should precede the author 's name .

		The characteristic demand of the American for everything to be '' up to date '' is nowhere better illustrated than in this com - pilation of the most recent events in our national life , arranged in a semi - chronological order under the title `` The History of the
Last Quarter-Century	DATE	in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Some will be found to question whether the cover - title , which omits the words '' A History of , '' be not the more nearly correct ; whether masses of detail '' the rudiments of empire , plastic still and warm '' can be caught up and moulded perforce into history ; whether a proper per - spective for discrimination and proper length of time for a crystallization of these historical atoms be not essential .

		Brought into existence by the enterprise of magazine editors and publishers who may be accepted as in touch with the popular demand , the series was awaited with a pleasant anticipa - tion due to its novelty , and was received with marks of approval .

		But the difficulties which lay about the magazine articles are even more apparent in book form : the unsatisfactory border-land between an essay on the present and one on the truly historical past ; the re - counting of what is neither newly-old nor oldly - new .

		One willingly listens to instruction and even persuasion upon the events of to-day , but upon those of the near yesterday he already has his opinion from personal observation .

		He does not wish to recall a mass of events cata - logued for each year , but will wait until hidden authorities have been revealed , until the evi - dence is all in and the popular verdict made up .

		No one , apparently , realizes these difficulties more than the author ; and in the preface , pre - sumably written after the articles had been gathered into their present form , he expresses only the hope that '' precisely on account of their occurrence in recent time , the doings here * THE HISTORY OF THE LAST QUARTER-CENTURY IN THE UNITED STATES , 1870-1895 .

		set forth will have a peculiarly living interest ; that the work may here and there rescue from oblivion some insignificant deed which would surely meet that fate were the recording de - ferred ; and that prospectors traversing this forest hereafter may get on better for our toil in blazing the path . ''

		But even if '' state and private papers are needed fully to explain the acts of public men and the policies of adminis - trations , '' had half the minor events been re - placed by comments of Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	, made after due digestion of the facts , the volumes would have promised more for the student .

		That , however , would have been fatal to the magazine purpose .

		Taking the work for what it purports to be and is a rapidly-moving and rapidly-painted panorama of the
last quarter	DATE	of a century , a framework written about a wealth of illustra - tion it must prove of interest to the general reader , and a mine of material for the Ameri - can '' jingoist . ''

		The progress of political events , interspersed with the `` heathen Chinee '' and ''
Molly Maguires	PERSON	, '' is sketched very freely and very fairly , although necessarily discon - nectedly .

		Much of it is newspaper and pamph - let quotation , reminding one of the progressive country newspaper which deems it necessary to cull from its file and publish in the first issue after the opening of the new year a '' resume of the chief events of interest chronicled in our community during the past year . '' ''

		The Recol - lections of
John Sherman	PERSON	'' is almost the only authority given .

		Prominent characters of the period must be dismissed with a scanty line , although here the opinions of Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	would be valuable .

		Of President
Hayes	PERSON	, he says : '' Partly the mode of his accession to office , and partly the rage of selfish placemen who could no longer have made their way , made it fashionable for a time to speak of President
Hayes	PERSON	as a weak man . '

		This was an entire error .

		His administration was in every way one of the most creditable in our history .

		He had a reso - lute will , irreproachable integrity , and a remarkably comprehensive and remarkably healthy view of public affairs ... He voluntarily banished the alluring pro- spect of a second term , and rose above all jealousy of his distinguished associates . ''

		Whilst his putting aside the chances of a sec - ond term may bring a smile to the faces of his living distinguished associates , the general ver - dict of Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	is prophetic of the change of public sentiment , and especially of that of historical writers , toward the administration of President
Hayes	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , he thinks that '' it may be doubted whether pos - 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, terity will give Mr.
Garfield	PERSON	quite the high place assigned him by contemporary judg - ment . ''

		He was '' somewhat vacillating and pas - sive , too much dominated by
Elaine	PERSON	's stronger nature , of solid character , no little personal magnetism , and great information . ''

		Of Presi - dent
Cleveland	LOCATION	he says that '' though a Demo - crat , he was yet president of all the people .

		Whatever else might be said against him , none could call him a demagogue . ''

		The election of
1888	DATE	was '' among the most corrupt in our his - tory , '' and President
Harrison	PERSON	'' cold and re - pelling rather than attracting those with whom he came into contact . ''

		The demonetization of silver in
1873	DATE	is at - tributed to the unauthorized representation of the
United States	LOCATION	as a gold country at the
Paris	LOCATION	conference , and to the fact that the meas - ure passed
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' unobserved ly , '' without any general debate .

		The allegation of fraud and sinister motives being discredited , Dr.
Francis Walker	PERSON	's arraignment of the legisla - tive committee for not placing the question properly before the country is quoted : '' The wisdom of a few people assuming to be wise for the whole of a great people was never more conspicuously shown than in the demonetiza - tion of the silver dollar . ''

		To the space-exhausting trivialities of local disasters and '' moving accidents by flood and field , '' the numerous passing contests in the labor world , the gruesome story of the harness - ing of the redskin to the car of civilization , are added many trifling anecdotes , rather forlorn specimens of '' American humor , '' which may attract the general reader but detract from the dignity of true historical writing .

		As one scans the several chapter heads , `` The
Geneva	LOCATION	Awards and the Credit Mobilier , '' ''
Hayes	PERSON	and the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Farthest North , '' '' Anything to beat Grant , '' he can not refrain from con - jecturing what portions of this mass will sur - vive in the eventual winnowing to become liv - ing parts of history , and what be cast aside as chaff .

		That dernier ressort of the reviewer , the share of the publishers , must be pardoned in this case .

		The illustrations bear the signa - tures of Thulstrup ,
Clinedinst	LOCATION	,
Fenn	PERSON	,
Pyle	PERSON	, and
Leigh	PERSON	, and form a most excellent collection of pictures made from photographs , diagrams , and descriptions by eye-witnesses .

		Of even more value to the student are the maps , plans , and facsimiles , which convey him within the borderland of the coveted '' original sources . ''

		It is sufficient for general workmanship to say that the two volumes are issued by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		As a novelty in the field of historical ventures , as the most recent record of our national measurements , and as an attract - ive exhibition of illustrators ' and publishers ' art , the volumes have no rival in the publica - tions of the year .

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i .

		The Christmas book-counters will present this year the usual tempting array , and none but very captious or very bewildered intending purchasers will be likely to turn away from them with their wants unsatisfied .

		The output as a whole strikes us as in many respects superior to that of previous seasons , notably in the essential matter of illustra - tions , where a marked advance is shown .

		Sound books , elegant bindings , and artistic pictures are the rule ; but there is no lack of the tasteful knick - knackery that seems to belong to the season .

		The cumbrous and showy folios popular in former years are now plainly extinct .

		Very sumptuous and costly works are not wanting ; but the tendency is in the direction of attractively-made books of intrinsic worth , at moderate prices .

		We trust the good taste and enterprise shown this year by the publishers will meet its due reward which seems likely enough now that our quadrennial term of commer - cial disturbance is over .

		As usual , our Holiday notices will appear in two instalments , a number of them being reserved for publication in our issue of
December 16	DATE	.

		In point of sumptuousness the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's mag - nificent presentation of Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's '' Life of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	'' may safely be pronounced hors concours among the season 's publications .

		The work is a masterpiece of modern luxurious book - making .

		The text is already known to the public from its appearance serially in '' The Century '' magazine , and we shall not now pass upon its merits further than to say that it is by all odds the most exhaustive life of
Napoleon	PERSON	yet written , and that it has received abundant commendation at the hands of competent critics on both sides of the water .

		The feature of the work with which we must now con - cern ourselves mainly is the illustrations ; and in their effort to render these both eminently suitable and rarely attractive , at once a delight to the eye and of the due educative value , the publishers have certainly done themselves very great credit .

		No resource has been unexhausted , so far as we can perceive , to render the book pictorially perfect .

		It is a pleasure to render honor where honor is due and we have no hesitation in saying that this noble chef d'oeuvre of the book - maker 's art surpasses thus far any publication of the kind , native or for - eign , that has ever fallen under our notice .

Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- of noted paintings in the original colors ; four are in monotint -LRB- one each in blue , green , sepia , and red -RRB- ; and six are wood-cuts and process-plates in black and white .

		We do not know in what re - spect the new process by which the color-work is done differs from that of the ordinary chromo - lithography ; but its results are certainly superior , especially in so far as depth and richness of tint and suggestion of over-laid pigment is concerned .

		Among the colored reproductions in the initial vol - ume are
Meissonier	PERSON	's ''
1814	DATE	, '' Flameng 's '' La Causerie , ''
Detaille	PERSON	's ''
Bonaparte	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' Isabey 's ''
Josephine	PERSON	, '' ''
Bonaparte	PERSON	at Arcole '' by Gros ,
Georges Cain	PERSON	's '' Bulletin of Victory from the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of
Italy	LOCATION	,
1797	DATE	, '' and so on .

		The completed work will contain eighty - eight of these colored plates alone , and they should form an interesting and beau - tiful collection .

		Messrs.
R. H. Russell & Son	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, issue several large quarto and folio volumes , generally similar in make-up , and of an interest mainly pic - torial .

		Two of these volumes '' Pictures of Peo - ple , '' by Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	, and '' In Vanity Fair , '' by Mr.
A. B. Wenzell	PERSON	, are of considerable artistic merit . ''

		Pictures of People '' contains eighty - five of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's latest drawings , including the studies of English society recently exhibited at the rooms of the Fine Art Society in
London	LOCATION	.

		This favorite artist 's manner needs no characterization here , and the present series of drawings presents some excellent examples of it .

		The volume is a large folio , twelve by eighteen inches , bound in white vellum and stamped with one of those graceful fem - inine figures that have rendered Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's pencil famous in its kind .

		Mr.
Wenzell	PERSON	's `` In Vanity Fair , '' a set of seventy spirited wash-drawings reproduced in half-tone , excel , in our judgment , from the artistic point of view , the foregoing series .

		Mr.
Wenzell	PERSON	is very happy in portraying fashionable society , its vagaries and amusements , his scenes at the opera , at the Horse Show , '' at the Waldorf , '' and so on , being done with much fidelity , and with a humor that never lapses into the coarse or grotesque .

		Unfor - tunately , in one plate , entitled '' Summer , '' he has essayed a flight into the region of the ideal , and the result may well serve to point the useful moral of Apelles : '' Ne sutor ultra crepidam . ''

		The book a large folio of twelve by eighteen inches is neatly bound in pale-green boards stamped with a figure that is certainly not one of the artist 's best .

		Two other volumes from the Messrs.
Russell	PERSON	are : '' Fables for the Times , '' by Mr.
H. W. Phillips	PERSON	, with draw - ings by Mr.
T. S. Sullivant	PERSON	; and Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	's ''
Coons	PERSON	. ''

		Some of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's '' Fables '' are new , others are adaptations of old favorites in up-to-date phraseology .

		Of the latter class we subjoin an ex - ample , which may also serve to indicate the author 's general style as a fabulist : '' A dog with a piece of meat in his mouth was crossing a bridge over a placid stream .

		On looking down he saw another dog with a precisely similar piece of meat in the water below him . '

		That 's a singular incident , ' he thought to himself as he prepared to jump in .

		` But hold a minute !

		The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection .

		Upon reflection I find that the other dog and the meat are only optical phenomena . '

		And he trotted on his way to
Boston	LOCATION	without further thought on the matter . ''

		Mr.
Sulli	PERSON	- vant 's drawings are a little in Mr.
A. B. Frost	PERSON	's vein , and are suitably funny .

		Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	's ''
Coons	PERSON	'' has no bearing on the arboreal animals commonly known by that title , but is a series of humorous sketches of the Southern darky -LRB- locally '' coon '' -RRB- drawn from life by Mr.
Kemble	PERSON	during a recent trip through the South .

		The plates are half - tones , printed in sepia , and the volume is a large quarto , nine and one-half by twelve inches .

		The artist shows keen appreciation of the oddities of the unsophisticated negro of the old-fashioned type , and his drawings are both laughable and graphic .

		A well planned and finely executed art work is
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Modern French Masters , '' com - prising a series of twenty biographical and critical monographs , each written by an American artist of repute chosen because of his special knowledge of or sympathy with the painter assigned him for treat - ment .

		The papers are not only criticisms of their respective subjects from the artists ' point of view , but are in many cases the friendly personal recol - lections of a former pupil or intimate friend .

		We regret the omission from the list of
Michel	LOCATION	; and if we remember rightly , there was a good article on that strong and original painter in the '' Century Magazine '' some three years ago though perhaps the writer of it was not an artist .

		Of course the striking feature of the vol - ume is the illustrations ; and these , consisting of thirty-seven wood engravings and twenty-eight half - tone photographic plates , afford an excellent oppor - tunity of judging of the relative merits of the two methods of reproduction .

		For our own part we should say that , regarded merely as translations of the original works , the half-tone plates are generally superior ; but they lack the strength , depth , and richness of effect of the best engravings .

		Among the engravers represented we note Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	, who furnishes six plates ; Mr.
Elbridge Kings	PERSON	- ley , who furnishes thirteen ; and Mr.
Henry Wolf	PERSON	, 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, who furnishes six .

		Mr.
Kingsley	PERSON	's series of plates after
Diaz	PERSON	and
Daubigny	PERSON	are notably good .

		Some of the works reproduced are :
Corot	LOCATION	's '' Orpheus Greeting the Morn , '' Game 's `` Thirst '' and '' The Carpet Merchant '' -LRB- both finely rendered by Mr.
Wolf	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Rousseau	PERSON	's `` St.
Michael	PERSON	's Mount '' and '' Twilight , ''
Diaz	PERSON	's landscapes '' Under Sunshine '' and '' Under Twilight , '' Millet 's '' The Sower '' and '' The Sheep-Shearer , ''

Bon Bock	PERSON	, '' Bastion-Lepage 's ''
Joan	PERSON	of Arc '' -LRB- detail -RRB- , Dagnan-Bouveret 's '' Horses at the Watering-Trough , '' etc. .

		A brief preface is fur - nished by Professor
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	, the editor of the volume , who also appends to each essay a biographical note on its author .

		Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	has a few judicious remarks to make on the painter 's time-honored contention that no one but a painter is a competent judge of a picture , as well as on its common reductio ad absurdum that then no one but a cook knows a good dinner , and no one but a cobbler can appreciate a good pair of shoes .

		Pro- fessor Van Dyke sensibly concludes that while the painter is undoubtedly the better judge -LRB- we should say in most cases the only judge -RRB- of technic , there is no reason why the cultured outsider should not be equally competent to determine the final result of a work of art , and its success or failure as a whole .

		Perhaps one may add that the tendency of the painter as critic to base his estimate of a work of art on its technical quality alone , and to unduly ignore its intellectual and aesthetic side , may very conceiv - ably sometimes render that estimate of more than questionable value .

		A canvas may well be tech - nically exquisite , and at the same time morally and aesthetically shocking .

		We do not think that the painter 's verdict on works of this description is apt to be as sound as that of the outside public .

		But we cheerfully agree with Professor Van Dyke that '' Soundness of technic is a condition to all great art . ''

		The present work forms a noble companion volume to its publishers ' '' Old Italian Masters '' and '' Old Dutch and Flemish Masters '' of former sea - sons .

		It is distinctly a credit to American book - making , from every point of view ; and the popu - larity of French art in this country should insure it a cordial reception .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a noble illustrated edition , in two large octavo volumes , of Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's '' The American Revolution '' that appears in the nick of time for those seeking a gift - book at once seasonably ornate and intrinsically valuable and weighty .

		The plates are well chosen and well made , serving the double purpose of em - bellishment and instruction .

		They consist of twenty - two photogravures of portraits and paintings , to - gether with some 280 text cuts representing historic buildings , medals , facsimiles , etc. .

		There are also some excellent colored maps and plates .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's graphic and spirited narrative gains much by the addition of these pictures , in the selection of which we understand he has cooperated ; and the work may be pronounced a satisfactory example of how history should be illustrated .

		In fact , we do not see how the plates could be at all materially improved upon .

		The volumes are printed from new electro - type plates on first-class paper , and present alto - gether a most attractive appearance .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a profusely illustrated two-volume edition of
Herman Grimm	PERSON	's monumental '' Life of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	. ''

		The idea was a good one , and it has been well carried out .

		The illustrations comprise a steel portrait of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, together with twenty-three photogravure plates from his paintings and sculptures , and seven - teen from notable works of other Italian masters
Raphael	PERSON	,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Da Vinci	PERSON	,
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	,
Correggio	LOCATION	,
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	, and others .

		The volumes are richly bound in maroon cloth stamped with gold , and are sheathed in slip-covers .

		Grimm 's book at once a life of the painter and a study of his times is classic , and needs no description or commenda - tion now .

		It is as readable as a romance , and teems with the fruits of ripe scholarship and profound observation .


Emerson	PERSON	said of it : '' When we come to
M. Angelo	PERSON	, his Sonnets and Letters must be read , with his life by
Vasari	PERSON	, or in our day by
Herman Grimm	PERSON	. ''

		Better far , say we , read the life by
Grimm	PERSON	a surer guide than the lively , imagina - tive Italian ; and to read
Grimm	PERSON	with the fullest measure of enjoyment , read him in the present beautiful edition .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are as usual in the field with one of their elaborate editions of selected works by
Irving	LOCATION	, this time the '' Surrey Edition '' of '' Bracebridge Hall . ''

		A deep marginal border in green -LRB- designed by Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	-RRB- frames the text on each page , and there are twenty - eight very acceptable photogravure illustrations after drawings by Messrs.
Reinhart	PERSON	,
Rackham	PERSON	,
Rix	PERSON	,
Hyde	LOCATION	,
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Sandham	PERSON	,
Miller	PERSON	, and
Schmolze	ORGANIZATION	.

		The binding is very dainty and tasteful , and the work should repeat the success of its popular pre - decessors . ''

		Historic Churches of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Thomas Whit - taker -RRB- , is a rather handsome volume , profusely and instructively illustrated , which indicates throughout careful preparation and painstaking research on the part of its author , Mr.
Walter F. Lonergan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lonergan	PERSON	claims to have gone a little ahead of all other writers , French or English , in his chosen field , in that he has dealt at greater length than his pre - decessors with the historical events with which the older
Paris	LOCATION	churches are associated .

		The book is thus certainly better suited to the needs and tastes of the general reader than archaeological treatises , like those of
Baron de Guilhermy	ORGANIZATION	, which deal chiefly with architectural matters , and only touch incident - ally on historical events .

		Mr.
Lonergan	PERSON	devotes most space to
Notre Dame	LOCATION	, the
Sainte Chapelle	ORGANIZATION	, and St.
Denis	PERSON	; these churches being the ones chiefly interesting to average visitors to
Paris	LOCATION	, and being , moreover , the three great legacies of Gothic genius in the possession of the city . ''

Paris	LOCATION	, the cathedral , the chapel of the Law Courts , and , to a large extent , the elegant edifice of St.
Denis	PERSON	, are the only structures reared by the genius of the soil , untrammelled by the necessity of imitating Greek temples or Roman basilicas at the bidding of Royal or imperial patrons . ''

		The author names as his authorities , the '' Chartrelarium
EC	ORGANIZATION	- clesice Parisiensis , ''
Viollet-le-Duc	PERSON	, de Guilhermy ,
Gibbon	PERSON	, Sir
F. Palgrave	PERSON	, the Abbs '
Perdreau	PERSON	, the literary ''
Paris	LOCATION	Guide , '' and
M. Dubre	PERSON	, whose treat - ise on the
Notre Dame	LOCATION	is the nearest approach to an historical rather than archaeological work on the subject .

		The illustrations -LRB- from photographs and after drawings by Mr.
B. S. Le Fanu	PERSON	-RRB- consist of exterior and interior views of the edifices described , doorways , windows , archways , gargoyles , and other architectural details .

		The volume is bound in stout crimson buckram emblematically stamped in gold , with olive-green back and quarter sides .

		It presents an attractive ensemble , and forms a suitable gift for a clerical friend , or a friend purposing to explore the antiquities of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		A pretty gift-book of intrinsic worth is M. Andre * Theuriet 's `` Rustic Life in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , illus - trated by M. Le * on
Lhermitte	PERSON	, and translated by Miss
Helen B. Dole	PERSON	.

		The translator 's pen has been well employed in rendering into fluent and rhyth - mic English this charming yet saddening retrospect .

		M. Theuriet 's book is at once the description and the threnody of French farm-life the rustic epic of a passing race of toilers of the field , in which one seems to catch an echo of the old lament , '' Great Pan is dead . '' ''

		It is all over with rustic life , '' sighs M. Theuriet .

		Industrial enterprise of the modern sort is turning its attention to the fields and meadows ; and small farming must ere long meet the fate of the unfittest . ''

		Syndicates '' will be formed to cultivate vast tracts by rapid and econom - ical processes .

		They will clear the forest area even now shrinking from year to year like
Balzac	LOCATION	's peau de chagrin .

		Only the other day a hard-headed deputy called the magnificent forests of
France	LOCATION	giant oaks beneath which Frankish warriors fought and feasted and throned their heroes on the uplifted shield `` unproductive wealth . ''

		The old rustic implements , time out of mind the symbols of the poet and the painter 's proper accessories the flail , the mattock , the sickle , the old-time arau , are giving way before the steam plough and reaper , and the threshing machine .

		Utility will rule . ''

		The country , furrowed by rectilinear roads , tram-ways , gravelled ways , will have the appearance of a great chess-board under mechanical cultivation , where everything will be by rule , mechanical and special - ized , like a gigantic manufactory . ''

		Even
Stuart Mill	PERSON	shrank from such a prospect .

		As his environ - ment changes , the peasant changes .

		Jacques Bon - homme is more and more inclined to leave his vil - lage and the paternal acres once his sole care and pride .

		The railroads have brought the ideas , the appetites , the pleasures , the unrest of the cities to his door ; and if he himself remains rooted to the soil , he swears his children shall not .

		Hence his sons and daughters flock -LRB- as with us -RRB- to the cities . ''

		The villages are becoming depopulated ; in cer - tain agricultural sections there are no farmers to be found , and whole territories remain neglected . ''

		These changes painfully affect M. Theuriet a man of sensibility and a lover of the picturesque ; and he mournfully celebrates the obsequies of a past which he loves .

		To preserve in a detailed picture the characteristic features of this past , the daily routine of French farm-life on a small hold - ing the sheep-shearing , vine-dressing , the humble field operations , the setting and weaving of flax , the gathering of the vintage , the village festivals and ceremonies , has been M. Theuriet 's primary aim .

		In this labor of love he associated with him - self the subtle painter of rustic landscape and genre ,
M. Ldon Lhermitte	PERSON	, whose illustrations , much in the manner of Millet , greatly enhance the charm and descriptive value of the text .

		The volume is richly bound in crimson cloth , with an emblematic side-stamp .

		Its attractive material ensemble and its moderate price should make it a popular gift - book .

		A copy of Messrs.
J. M. Dent	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new and pretty one-volume edition of '' The Compleat An - gler '' forms a choice gift for a friend of piscatorial tastes .

		The ubiquitous Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	is the editor , and he has provided a good text , reprinted in the main from that of Sir
Harris Nicolas	PERSON	, who used that of
Walton	PERSON	's fifth edition , the last one re - vised by him .

		Cotton 's treatise is omitted -LRB- this fact should have been mentioned editorially -RRB- , and the notes are few and brief .

		The somewhat lengthy Introduction summarizes the events of Izaak 's life , discusses his character as displayed in his books , and comments instructively on the ancient and mod - ern practice of fishing a theme on which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, himself a reputed '' brother of the angle , '' is very much at home .

		We note that in the Introduction
Walton	PERSON	's worthy predecessor
Dame Juliena Berners	PERSON	, author of '' The Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle , '' is made to figure as
Dame Juliana Barnes	PERSON	.

		The book is profusely and attractively illustrated with woodcuts by Mr.
E. J. Sullivan	PERSON	, and it forms altogether about the best moderate-priced handy edition of this sweet and indispensable old classic that we know of .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's '' The Externals of Mod - ern
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- forms a desirable supplement to Mrs.
Martha J. Lamb	PERSON	's '' The History of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, '' being ostensibly Chapter XXL , Volume II .

		of that useful chronicle .

		Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	's narrative , it may be remem - bered , came to a halt with the year 1880 ; and Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	takes up the story at that point , and brings it down to date as comprehensively as possi - ble in the relatively limited space at her command .

		A great many interesting events in
New York	LOCATION	's civic progress -LRB- mainly on its material side -RRB- have 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, occurred since
1880	DATE	; and of these events Mrs. Har - rison gives a succinct and lively description .

		To read her book is to gain a pretty clear notion of the salient externals of the
Gotham	LOCATION	of to-day .

		With the deeper moral , religious , social , and political issues that suggest themselves to the philosophical observer of
New York	LOCATION	's civilization , Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	does not pretend to deal her business being , like her predecessor 's , to describe and to narrate .

		Like Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	, she lets facts speak mainly for them - selves , wisely crediting her readers with the ability to draw a plain inference .

		The volume is a neatly made small quarto of some eighty-five pages -LRB- includ - ing the index -RRB- , and is quite presentable enough as to externals to form a suitable Holiday gift-book .

		It is liberally illustrated with characteristic views and street scenes of the
New York	LOCATION	of to-day .

		Those , especially , who possess Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	's book should obtain Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's continuation of it though the latter may be read as an independent work .

		A brace of smart little volumes , the initial ones in the promising series of ''
Bodley	PERSON	Head Antholo - gies , '' come to us from
Messrs. A. C. McCiurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who publish them in conjunction with Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The first volume is `` English Epithalamies , '' edited by Mr.
Robert H. Case	PERSON	; the second is `` Musa Piscatrix , '' by Mr.
John Buchan	PERSON	.

		The aim of Mr.
Case	PERSON	has been to bring together for the first time the Epithalamia or nuptial songs of the Elizabethans and their successors , his collection including nearly all English poems rightly styled Epithalamia by their authors , or which may in the now widened acceptation of the term be fairly classed as such whether brief songs or longer poems , whether original or translated to the close of the seventeenth century , with a few admissions from the early years of the eighteenth .

		Narrative poems , such as Suckling 's '' Ballad of a Wedding '' and Braithwait 's ''
Shepherd	PERSON	's Holyday '' are prop - erly excluded , as are the numerous class of merely congratulatory '' Odes '' and '' Poems '' loosely styled Epithalamia , though not particularly referring to the wedding day .

		Mr.
Case	PERSON	notes as partly indi - cating his principle of selection , that `` the term Epithalmium , originally used to denote the song at the bridal chamber as distinguished from those sung during the wedding procession or at the feast , has long been attached to every kind of nuptial poem , provided it be supposed to precede or even imme - diately succeed the nuptial night , and concludes with a few good wishes more or less allusive to the occa - sion . ''

		The volume is carefully and elaborately edited , containing , besides the poems , a lengthy introduction , '' A List of Omitted Epithalamia writ - ten before
1700	DATE	, '' a list of those published since that date , and an Appendix containing an account of '' The maner of rejoysings at mariages and wed - dings , '' from '' The Arte of English Poesie . ''

		Great care has evidently been taken to secure the best possible texts ; and the editor has given , where pos - sible , in the margin the date of the marriage cele - brated , or , failing that , of the poem 's appearance in print .

		The collection is an excellent one , and contains some of the gems of English lyric verse .

		Mr.
Buchan	PERSON	's ''
Musa Piscatrix	PERSON	'' is appropriately dedicated to Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, a
Walton	ORGANIZATION	editor , the author of some capital fishing lyrics , and a prac - tised angler withal who glories to have thrown in air , High over arm the trembling reed , By Ale and
Kail	PERSON	, by Till and Tweed . ''

		The little book can scarcely claim for itself , as the editor admits , the title of an anthology , being no serious collection of English fishing songs , whose name is legion , but rather a little sheaf of piscatorial verses , mostly old and all choicely good , gleaned from a relatively narrow field .

		Little has been taken from any one author , save
Thomas Tod Stod	PERSON	- dart , the angling poet-laureate who is represented by a dozen selections ; and the editor has sought to include only verse which has some of the higher poetic qualities .

		Among the authors included may be noted
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Phineas Fletcher	PERSON	,
Waller	PERSON	,
Walton	PERSON	,
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Donne	PERSON	,
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	, Pope , Gay ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Matthew	PERSON	Ar - nold -LRB- a rather theoretical angler , one fancies -RRB- , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		The editor supplies a pleasant foreword and a few brief notes , and there are six full-page etchings by Mr.
E. Philip Pimlott	PERSON	.

		The volumes are neatly bound in blue buckram with chaste cover-design in gold , and altogether form unexceptionable gift-books of the more modest order .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' tasteful '' Stamboul Edition '' -LRB- authorized -RRB- of De Amicis 's '' Constanti - nople '' comes with a certain timeliness , now that the eyes of the civilized world are turned anxiously toward the Golden Horn .

		The glowing pictures of the impressionable Italian traveller fill one with a sense of shame and regret that this fair and storied city should at the close of our boasted century of enlightenment be polluted by scenes of slaughter unparallelled since the days of
Tamerlane	LOCATION	.

		De Amicis was deeply impressed by the oriental splen - dor of
Constantinople	LOCATION	and its matchless environs ; and his pen , ever prodigal of lustre and color , is tempted into even unwonted rhapsodies . ''

		Oh for the eyes of a De Amicis ! ''

		the traveller to the
Bosphorus	LOCATION	may well exclaim '' that I , too , might see all this splendor where so many phlegmatic souls have seen little save squalor , filth , beggary , swind - ling landlords , lying dragomans , and dog-infested lanes and alleys . ''

		Truly , as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	said of
Rome	LOCATION	, he who goes to
Constantinople	LOCATION	takes his Constanti - nople with him .

		The book is one of the author 's best , and it is well translated by
Caroline Tilton	PERSON	.

		There are twenty-five attractive plates , and the cover is a chaste one of dark-green with gilt tracery .

		We infer from Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's pleasant foreword to the comely volume of selections from Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, entitled `` A Year in the Fields '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , that the credit of planning the book belongs to him .

		At all events , the idea i is a happy one .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	observes that in
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 all Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	writes the personal element is very marked ; and he adds , what is equally unde - niable , that not only is Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	present in what he writes , but we are glad to have him there .

		The essential idea of the volume which is finely illustrated after out-of-door photographs by Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is that in it Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	shall be pic - torially , as well as spiritually , omnipresent .

		In the frontispiece , for instance , we are shown him stand - ing knee-deep in a thick clump of undergrowth , con - templating with botanical relish a flowering stalk blissfully unconscious the while that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is taking a '' snap-shot '' at him ; a second plate shows him gazing out over the broad expanse of the frozen
Hudson	LOCATION	, perhaps meditating a paragraph , or men - tally reckoning the profits of the past season 's fruit - crop ; in a third he stands nonchalantly , spectacles in hand , at the door of his bark-covered study at '' Riverby '' ; in a fourth , he is gathering wild flow - ers ; in a fifth , splitting wood '' for the study fire , '' and so on .

		The views were secured by Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	during several visits at Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's country homes on the
Hudson	LOCATION	and in the
Catskills	LOCATION	.

		Whether or not the host at these times was entertaining a photographer unawares is not apparent ; but the plates , certainly , are agreeably free from the usual suggestion of '' posing . ''

		The essays , like the pic - tures , range through all the four seasons ; and they are delightful specimens of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	at his best .

		The volume is neatly bound in dark-green and gilt , and forms a rare gift-book of the more inex - pensive sort .

		Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	's capital novel , '' A Window in Thrums , '' is brought out by
Messrs. Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an inviting edition the main feature of which is seventy photographic views taken in and around Kirriemuir -LRB- '' Thrums '' -RRB- by that expert knight of the camera , Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	met Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	in
Kirriemuir	LOCATION	, and the latter expressed his approval of this mode of illustrating his master - piece .

		In selecting his views the artist has made an effort to follow the suggestions in the text .

		Thus , the list of illustrations embraces such titles as '' The Door to
Hendry	PERSON	's Cot , '' `` The Little Window , '' `` The Bill-Sticker , '' `` The Dulseman , '' `` The Loom , '' '' The
Auld Licht Kirk	PERSON	, '' '' The Manse , '' '' At the Gate of the Commonty , '' and so on .

		Judging from the plates , the country about '' Thrums '' must be rather bleak and harsh ; and the village '' types '' that got in range of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's camera are cer - tainly a hard-featured lot in fact , Scotch people of the lower class are apt to be as homely as gar - goyles .

		The famous window , we learn , '' looks easterly down the brae and over the town , and it is remarkable how , as one wanders about the village and over the surrounding hill-slopes , the cot at the top of the brae comes into view , and how the little window preternaturally follows your movements like an ever-watchful eye . ''

		Under the window there now hangs , alas , a sign-board bearing the prosaic legend , '' A Window in Thrums : Souvenirs and lemonade for sale within '' for tourists now flock to
Kirrie	PERSON	- muir , and the tenants of
Hendry	ORGANIZATION	's cot are thrifty folk .

		It will be a pleasure to read , or to re-read , Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's book in this edition .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are , as usual at this season , in the field with well-made and low-priced editions of standard books suitable for Christmas gifts of enduring value .

		Among these we may note '' The Poetical Works of
Alexander Pope	PERSON	, '' in two trim duodecimo volumes , edited with notes and memoir by Dr.
Adolphus William Ward	PERSON	.

		A good text respectably printed is provided , together with some interesting facsimiles and reprints of early frontispieces .

		There are also portraits of Pope ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Addison	PERSON	, Queen
Anne	PERSON	,
Gibber	PERSON	, Swift ,
Donne	PERSON	, and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and views of Pope 's
Twicken	PERSON	- ham villa and of
Windsor Castle	ORGANIZATION	from the river .

		Another desirable issue is a two-volume edition of the '' Poems of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, '' comprising his own selection with additions from his latest works .

		The work is edited with biographical and critical introduction and notes by
Charlotte Porter	PERSON	and
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, editors of '' Poet Lore . ''

		Type , binding , illustrations , etc. , are excellent , price consid - ered , and the edition strikes us as especially adapted to the needs of clubs and schools where the study of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	is pursued .

		The same firm issues in attractive shape
John Ormsby	PERSON	's fine version of ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' also in two volumes .

		The edition is em - bellished with thirty-three spirited etchings by Lalauze , together with a portrait and a map .

		Ample editorial helps to intelligent reading are provided , and altogether the edition is a good one for actual reading .

		We have often taken occasion to commend generally these useful reprints of
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The putting of good books well made within reach of all is a form of private enterprise that is in the nature of a public service .

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	have shown fine taste in the makeup of a pair of very dainty and enticing two-volume editions of two works that should make a strong bid for popular favor .

		The first of them is
Ouida	LOCATION	's lively military novel , '' Under Two Flags '' ; and in no other edition of the book that we know of can the chequered career of that delectable life - guardsman , the Hon.
Bertie Cecil	PERSON	, be followed un - der such alluring material conditions .

		The binding is of blue cloth with gold side-stamp , and the page is a pretty one with sufficient margin and clear print .

		Each volume contains four illustrations , after the spirited drawing of
M. G. Montbard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second work is '' Myths and Legends of Our Own Land , '' by Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	.

		Anyone har - boring the delusion that
America	LOCATION	has not yet devel - oped a legendary era may be disabused of it by the perusal of this varied and interesting collection of native myths and legends .

		The contents are geo - graphically classified , the first division including legends of '' The Hudson and its Hills '' ; the second , those of '' The Isle of Manhattoes and Nearby '' ; the third , `` On and Near the
Delaware	LOCATION	'' ; the fourth , `` Tales of Puritan Land '' ; the fifth , `` Lights and Shadows of the South '' ; the sixth , '' The Cen - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, tral States and Great Lakes , '' and so on , to the
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tales , Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	says , '' have been gathered from sources the most diverse ; rec - ords , histories , newspapers , magazines , oral narra - tives , and in every case reconstructed . ''

		The col - lection is certainly most curious and suggestive , and seems to justify the author 's claim that it is meas - urably complete .

		The volumes are bound in light - yellow cloth with a delicate border-design in green , and contain a number of pleasing photographic plates .

		As usual at the
Christmas	LOCATION	season , a brace of tiny booklets in
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's familiar '' Thumb - nail '' series make their appearance and very op - portunely for those in search of a specially dainty and unpretentious , yet tasteful , Holiday gift-book .

		The volumes this year are : '' Break o ' Day , '' by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	, an old contributor to this series ; and '' Tracings ; or , A Reflection of Nature , '' by
Miss E. Scott O'Connor	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	again exploits his particular literary field , the islands off the
Maine	LOCATION	coast , and gives us a collection of seven crisp little sketches , which mirror the every - day life of the fisher-folk of that outlying region their quarrels , friendships , courtships , and so on .

		Some pretty drawings accompany the text .

		Miss
O'Connor	PERSON	's '' Tracings '' is a collection of aphorisms , in the manner of La Rochefoucauld , prefaced by a sprightly little essay on aphorisms and aphorists in general , by Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	.

		Miss
O'Connor	PERSON	has the right knack of packing much sense in few words , and deserves the pleasant things Miss Rep - plier says of her .

		The volumes are of vest-pocket size , full gilt , and bound in full stamped leather .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a very dainty illustrated edition of MerimeVs masterpiece , '' Car - men , '' with an appreciative Memoir of the author by Miss
Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edmund H. Gar	PERSON	- rett is the artist , and his five etched plates and seven etched vignettes are nicely done .

		The frontis - piece is a portrait in photogravure of Calve '' as Car - men a pretty thing in itself , though we should have preferred , on grounds of general fitness , the artist 's ideal of his author 's tempestuous heroine .

		The cover is of pale-green cloth , with a modest de - sign in dark-green and gold .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a new and cheaper edition of Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	's familiar '' Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail , '' with the original drawings by Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	.

		The book is easily chief in its especial field , and the reprint is in remarkably good style , its very moderate price con - sidered .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and Mr.
Remington	PERSON	form a very strong team in depicting the
Far West	LOCATION	and its types ; and we are glad to see this fresh and spirited work put in popular and inexpensive form .

		Two new books in
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's dainty '' Faience Edition '' are George Sand 's ''
Fa	ORGANIZATION	- dette '' and
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's `` An
Iceland	LOCATION	Fisherman . ''

		The translator of the former book is Mrs.
James M. Lancaster	PERSON	; of the latter , Miss
Helen B. Dole	PERSON	; and both ladies have acquitted themselves credit - ably .

		The volumes are acceptably illustrated , and they rank among the best of the more inexpensive gift-books . ''

		In a North Country Village '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
M. E. Francis	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Francis Blundell	PERSON	-RRB- , is a deftly-woven and summer-scented garland of tales and sketches of English rustic life , that reminds one pleasantly of Miss Mitford .

		Thornleigh , a slum - brous little place of the now vanishing type of that immortal hamlet that nestles as it were amid the sounding stanzas and solemn reveries of the '' Elegy , '' is the village in question ; and to its cus - toms , humors , types , and traditions the author de - votes some 260 graphic pages .

		The book is sym - pathetically illustrated by Mr.
F. Felloes	PERSON	, and con - tains a colored frontispiece .

		A suitable gift-book for a lover of
Browning	PERSON	would be found in a copy of
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's rather showy edition of ''
Saul	PERSON	. ''

		The volume is a handy octavo , tastefully bound in green and gold ; and the text is clearly printed on rather thick glazed paper with liberal margin .

		Mr.
Frank O. Small	PERSON	's drawings are acceptably done , for the most part , reflecting successfully the fine Hebraic spirit of the verse .

		The price of the volume is moderate , in view of its elaborate make-up .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		It is interesting to note that neither the hard times nor the late political absorption has prevented the pub - lication of fully the usual quota of children 's Christmas books .

		The average of quality , too , is well maintained .

		In fact , quite a complete youth 's library might be se - lected from the books published this year if it were properly chosen .

		There is no fallacy more absurd than the popular one that anybody is qualified to select a library for a child .

		A library should always be an ex - pression of the tastes and ideas of an individual , a family , or a circle .

		If it is not such an expression , it is not a library it is simply a crude collection of books .

		To use a homely figure , a youth 's library should fit him , but it should fit him loosely ; space should be left for him to grow .

		It should represent , of course , his tastes and mental bent should show whether he is controlled in the main by the spirit of adventure , of science , of art , or of music ; but there should be room in it for a few books a little above his mental stage , so that he may be constantly led to reach up to them .

		Another pernicious fallacy regarding children 's books is that style does not appeal to the young .

		If anyone believes it does not , let him open , among the current season 's books , the one prepared by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	with the title '' The Animal Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , and read to any intelligent child of nine years
Dumas	PERSON	pere 's de - scription of Mysouf I. ,
Mysouf II.	PERSON	, and
Pritchard	PERSON	, and note how soon
Dumas	PERSON	pere becomes a living personality to the child .

		Then let him turn and read , out of the same book , the account of ''
Cowper	PERSON	and bis Hares . ''

		Bess and Puss and Tiney were doubtless as interesting in their way as the dogs and cats and monkeys owned by
Dumas	PERSON	pere ; but the child does not care for them he begs you to read more from
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Young as the child is ,
Dumas	PERSON	has cast a spell around him the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 spell of a sparkling and animated style .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Animal Story Book '' ought to delight both old and young , as one may find therein pen-portraits of most of the remarkable animals that have interested the world since primitive times .

		And because authors are , as a class , peculiarly fond of animals , the reader of this charming book is brought into intimate relations with
Pliny	LOCATION	,
The'ophile Gautier	PERSON	, and many other remarkable men .

		Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	's '' Soldier Stories '' -LRB- Mac - milllan -RRB- are evidently intended for boys of a somewhat larger growth .

		Some parents might think them pretty strong meat for even their older boys ; but there are great elemental truths underlying the stories , which will not be lost upon readers of any age .

		In this book Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has given some of his largest and most vivid views of the life of the British soldier .

		In some respects he appears to challenge comparison with
Les Trois Mousquelaires	ORGANIZATION	; the British riflemen ,
Ortheris	PERSON	,
Mulvaney	PERSON	, and Learoyd , seeming as fond of war and as contemptuous of the raw soldier as were their prede - cessors ,
Athos	ORGANIZATION	,
Porthos	LOCATION	, and
Aramis	PERSON	.

		The story en - titled '' With the Main Guard '' is almost Homeric in tone and treatment . ''

		The Drums of the Fore and Aft '' is a unique study of the life and death of two plucky drummer-boys , who are genuine types . ''

		The Courting of
Dinah Shadd	ORGANIZATION	'' is a soldier 's idyl ; while `` The Man Who Was '' is a most telling protest against the Rus - sian Siberian prison system .

		The illustrations of this book are genuine additions to the text .

		All of the charm and much of the tragedy of South - ern life before the Civil War may be found in Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's two juvenile books , '' Daddy Jake the Runaway '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and '' The Story of Aaron the Son of Ben AH '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Daddy Jake the Runaway '' is not so picturesque as '' The Story of Aaron , '' but it is more artistic .

		No better short story of plantation life has yet been written . ''

		The Story of Aaron the Son of
Ben Ali	PERSON	, '' the Arab chief who was sold as a negro slave , and of the fierce horse Timoleon , is not only picturesque but is strikingly oriental in its tone .

		An air of mystery surrounds both the characters , and even the adult reader is almost persuaded that
Aaron	PERSON	understands the language of animals .

		There is a slight historic background to this unique story , and one meets again with the faces of
Buster John	PERSON	, Sweetest
Susan	PERSON	, and
Drusilla	PERSON	, familiar to readers of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's pre - vious books .

		Another book distinguished for its admirable style is Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's '' Sweetheart Travellers '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It may perhaps interest fathers and mothers even more than children , as it is full of that loving comprehension of a little maid 's sayings and fancies which comes to a father just once in a life-time during that period when he is curiously studying the nameless little arts of his first-born .

		It is daintily illustrated by Mr.
Gordon Browne	PERSON	and Mr.
W. H. C. Groome	PERSON	.

		That veteran delineator of boy character and life , Mr.
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	, has written one of the best boy 's books of the season in '' The Prize Cup '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is healthful and inspiring , and tells with force and interest the old story of the ease with which a well - meaning but weak-willed boy may be led into tempta - tion from mere good nature .

		The contrasting charac - ters of
Osk Ordway	LOCATION	,
Gideon Ketterell	PERSON	,
Fred Melverton	PERSON	, and
Canton Quimby	PERSON	are admirably defined .

		There are several humorous characters as Mrs.
Ketterell	PERSON	the sturdy washerwoman , and Gran ` sir Pudgwick .

		Midget is a charming little deaf-and-dumb child , whose whim - sicalities and quaint ideas of right and wrong enliven the book .

		The story is sympathetically illustrated by Mr.
Relyea	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	's '' Century Book of Famous Americans , '' published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the auspices of the '' Daughters of the Revolution , '' will rank in trustworthiness and in local color , if not in dra - matic presentation , with
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's and Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's histories for the young .

		The chapter on the
Adams	PERSON	family is particularly interesting and sug - gestive .

		The book could be used to advantage in schools for supplementary reading .

		The illustrations are well executed , and add greatly to the interest of the work .

		A book in a quite different field , written by Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	in collaboration with Mr.
John Alden	PERSON	, is '' The Long Walls '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It is an ex - periment in archaeology , being an account of a boy 's experience in excavating ancient marbles in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		The hero discovers a subterranean chamber sacred to
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	, wherein the mystic rites connected with the worship of that goddess were celebrated in primitive times .

		The story is graphically told , with a judicious admixture of classic lore .

		If it fails to inspire Ameri - can boys with a passion for antiquities , it will at least acquaint them with many interesting matters connected with ancient history and literature .

		The book is well illustrated from photographs taken in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Another boy 's book by Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	is '' Un - der the Tamaracks '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a lively story of life in the
Thousand Isles	LOCATION	, in the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	river .

		The three boys who inhabit
Tamarack	LOCATION	Tower meet
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, who is summering at the
Thousand Isles	LOCATION	, and the readers of the book share the advan - tages of the distinguished acquaintanceship .

		The main interest of the story , however , centres in the doings of two undesirable neighbors , one of whom , `` the Seedy Man of
Whiskey Island	LOCATION	, '' seems to be a new type of the disagreeable characters that sometimes infest the mod - ern
summer	DATE	home .

		The story and its illustrations are of a kind to delight the heart of the average boy for whom it was evidently written .

		Oddly enough , Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's `` Admiral J. of Spurwink '' -LRB-
A. I. Bradley & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- has a plot not unlike that of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's '' Under the Tamaracks , '' substantially the same idea evidently occurring to both authors , and Mr.
Otis	PERSON	's '' Admiral '' apparently belong - ing to the same unlovely type as '' the Seedy Man of
Whiskey Island	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is full of thrilling adven - ture and hair-breadth escapes , for '' Admiral J. '' was an unscrupulous villain with a long head for mischief .

		Another book by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	is '' A Short Cruise '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , a pretty little story of a sea-captain 's sudden fancy for a quiet little girl .

		The three characters of the crusty old sea-captain , the mischievous boy , and the demure little maiden are well contrasted A third little book by Mr.
Otis	PERSON	is called '' On Schedule Time '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a stirring account of the manner in which two plucky boys made a rapid journey through the woods in order to reach a lumbering camp within a given time , so as to save their father from what might have been a disastrous lawsuit .

		Any young person who is interested in commercial affairs will find Mr.
J. Macdonald Oxley	PERSON	's '' Romance of Commerce '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- both useful and entertaining .

		The author has described such famous commercial en - terprises as '' The
Mississippi	LOCATION	Bubble , '' '' The South Sea Bubble , '' and '' The
Hudson 's Bay Trading Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' in a 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, manner to afford any intelligent boy an insight into the nature of commercial affairs .

		The value of the book is enhanced by quaint old pictures and portraits from con - temporary prints .

		Books of fairy-tales appear this season in good num - bers and of good quality .

		Miss
Zoe Dana Underbill	PERSON	's volume entitled '' The Dwarfs ' Tailor and Other Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- has a scope much broader than its title indicates , since it aims to give a typical tale from the folk-lore of various countries .

		The result is a collection of fairy stories which , with their attractive illustrations , will delight the heart of any imaginative child Other fortunate children will be enabled to make many pleas - ant voyages on the sea of imagination by means of Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	's '' Book of Wonder Voyages '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Many famous voyages are included , such as '' The Argonauts , '' '' The Voyage of Maelduin , '' '' Hasan of Bassorah , '' and '' The Journeyings of Thorkild and of Eric the Far-Travelled . ''

		The illustrations of the book , by Mr.
John D. Batten	PERSON	, are very weird and fan - tastic .

		A new edition of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Wonder Book for Girls and Boys '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , with a colored frontis - piece and several striking illustrations in black and white , is a boon for the child who loves the old Greek myths .

		In reading the stories of '' The Miraculous Pitcher , '' '' The Chimsera , '' and '' The Gorgon 's Head , '' one almost feels as if
Hawthorne	PERSON	and the poet
Morris	PERSON	were the only true story-tellers of our time .

		It is almost a century since the
Grimm Brothers	ORGANIZATION	put their profound folk-lore investigations into the form of those fairy tales that have delighted so many generations of children ; and their popularity seems to increase rather than diminish .

		Miss
Lucy Crane	PERSON	's translation of some of the best of these stories is published in a pretty and inexpensive volume by
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , one of them in colors , by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, give an added charm to the little book .

		In '' The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- Mr.
Ernest Vincent Wright	PERSON	attempts a versified narrative of the doings of various tricksy spirits , including '' The Musical Sprites , '' `` The Frost Fairies , '' `` The Wind Fairies , '' '' The Cloud Fairies , '' etc. .

		The illustrations , by Miss
Cora M. Norman	PERSON	, are well suited to the fan - tastic character of the book .

		The new and remarkably cheap edition of '' Tales from
Hans Andersen	PERSON	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , with numerous illustrations by Miss
Helen Stratton	PERSON	, will not make its appeal in vain to the buyer of children 's gift-books .

		The collection includes those fairy stories which may be numbered among the classics , such as '' The Ugly Duckling , '' The Little Mermaid , '' and '' The Wild Swans . ''

		Some original stories by Miss
Bessie Hatton	PERSON	are brought within this category by their title , '' The Village of Youth , and Other Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , although they deal almost too much with the theme of love to be adapted to the taste or needs of children .

		The book is acceptably illustrated from de - signs by Mr.
W. H. Margetson	PERSON	.

		A decided novelty of the season is Dr.
Garrett	PERSON	New - kirk 's `` Rhymes of the States '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work seems to have been planned upon Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	's favorite theory that a dry fact is best impressed on the mind of a child by means of a jingle .

		The aim has been to embody familiar facts in the history and geography of the country in a series of easy rhymes , a set for each State ; and these are accompanied with pictures illus - trating the ideas conveyed in the verses .

		There are also good outline maps of each
State	ORGANIZATION	, with a caricature picture of some familiar object or animal to which the outline bears a fanciful resemblance .

		Thus ,
Indiana	LOCATION	is represented as an Indian chief ,
Georgia	LOCATION	in the military figure of
General Oglethorpe	LOCATION	, while
Mississippi	LOCATION	is given General
Jackson	PERSON	's military coat .

		The illustrator of the book , Mr.
Harry Fenn	PERSON	, has been signally successful in his representations in black-and-white ; and the silhou - ettes of the States have been accurately drawn to scale by Mr.
H. L. Bridwell	PERSON	.

		One of the best of the season 's books for girls is Mrs.
C. V. Jamison	PERSON	's `` Seraph , the Little Violinist '' -LRB-
W. A. Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The scene is laid in the French Quarter of
New Orleans	LOCATION	; and there is a generous ``
Monsieur Nardi	PERSON	, '' who is a bibliomaniac and has a rare old book - shop ; Seraph 's little mother is a cripple , a maker of artificial flowers ; and `` Unc ' Romeo '' is the typical Southern negro servant .

		With these materials Mrs.
Jamison	PERSON	has created a charming child 's story , with a delightful musical atmosphere .

		The book is daintily illustrated by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the most prolific writer for boys of the pres - ent day is Mr.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	, whose stories would alone fill a small book-case .

		Three new books by him are presented this year by Messrs.
Seribner	PERSON	's Sons '' At Agincourt , '' the adventurous story of an English page who with his mistress was held as a hostage in
Paris	LOCATION	by the French King Charles ; '' On the Irrawaddy , '' depict - ing the stirring experiences of an English boy attached to the staff of Sir
Archibald Campbell	PERSON	during some of the famous campaigns in
India	LOCATION	; and `` With
Cochrane	PERSON	the Dauntless , '' the narrative of a young British soldier who served under
Lord Cochrane	ORGANIZATION	in
Chili	LOCATION	and
Brazil	LOCATION	, was a prisoner in
Peru	LOCATION	, and escaped almost miracu - lously from innumerable perils in field and dungeon .

		The three books are freely illustrated .

		A curious collection of verse and prose descriptive of a dainty little maiden whom the author styles '' W. V. '' is Mr.
William Canton	PERSON	's ''
W. V.	PERSON	, Her Book '' -LRB-
Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The heroine is described as an eager little creature who wants to take the whole of life at once into her two diminutive hands .

		She has a vocabulary of her own ; some words she has coined , some she has ap - propriated , and others she has turned topsy-turvy .

		She delights in fairy lore , and wants some one to invent for her the story of a little girl who lived in a bubble .

		The book is quaintly illustrated by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	.

		The romance of history , properly treated , is about as wholesome and appetizing a literary diet as can be pro- vided for young folks .

		One of the best of the season 's books of this character is Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's volume on
Georgia	LOCATION	, in the series of '' Stories from Amer - ican History '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		The popular author of '' Uncle Remus '' has collected from out-of-the-way places and hidden nooks of literature a large number of stories connected with the history of
Georgia	LOCATION	, making a book which much resembles Mr.
John Esten Cooke	PERSON	's '' Stories of the Old Dominion . ''

		The whole field of
Georgia	LOCATION	's life is covered , stories of the hardy pioneers of ante-Revolution days finding place with the daring ''
Andrews	PERSON	raid '' during the Civil War .

		The volume is well illustrated .

		The boy who has never happened to read Captain
Mayne Reid	PERSON	's stories of '' The
Bush	PERSON	Boys , '' '' The Boy Hunters , '' or '' The Young Voyageurs , '' is well provided for this year by the handsome illustrated editions issued by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , and appropriately named '' The Nimrod Edition . ''

		These stories might almost be termed boy-classics ; certainly no boy 's education as an adventurer could be considered quite complete until he
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 has read them .

		They are a connecting link between ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and '' The Three Musketeers '' just as
Dumas	PERSON	pere is in the end succeeded by Hugo and
Gautier	PERSON	.

		A rollicking story for a boy of ten or twelve years of age , which might well precede the works of
Mayne Reid	ORGANIZATION	, is Mr.
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	's `` Captain Chap '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It has some interesting incidents , laugh - able situations , and witty sayings , although '' Captain Chap '' and '' Adam '' are not original types , and the literary quality of the work will hardly add to Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's reputation .

		Few writers are better fitted to prepare boys ' stories from Greek and Latin sources than is Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, whose life has been spent in the preparation of such literary and historical compendiums , and whose popular '' Half Hour Series '' may be found in almost every public library in the country .

		This year he pre - sents two pretty companion volumes of '' Historical Tales '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , one from Greek and one from Latin sources .

		The volumes are well illustrated with classic views and portraits , and will make a safe and attractive present for any bright boy or girl .

		Miss
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	's '' A Cape May Diamond '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is rather overdrawn , although there is con - siderable cleverness in the management of the plot , and in the dialect .

		It must be a rather difficult feat to create a child-philanthropist out of a little shipwrecked waif who has never known what it is to have a home or guardianship .

		Perhaps the author has insisted a little too much upon pointing the moral , and hence the story has suffered .

		I ^ ITEKARY NOTES . ''

		Under the Greenwood Tree '' has just been added to the handsome library edition of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's novels , published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Part XVI .

		of Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	's beautiful edition of the '' Faerie Queene '' has been issued by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three more parts will complete the work .

		The current number of '' Modern Art '' is an excep - tionally interesting and well illustrated issue of this beautiful quarterly , which is now published by
Messrs. L. Prang & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The death of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	is reported from
England	LOCATION	just as we are going to press , but no particu - lars are yet attainable .

		We shall speak more at length upon this subject in our next issue .

		An eighth series of '' Cameos from English History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Charlotte M. Yonge	PERSON	, deals with the period 1662-1748 , and has '' The End of the Stew - arts '' for its special titular designation .

		Mr.
C. Horstman	PERSON	's scholarly edition of the writings of ''
Richard Rolle	PERSON	of Hampole and His Followers '' is completed by the publication of a second volume .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		Recent translations into the Japanese language include Professor
Marshall	PERSON	's '' Economics '' and Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's '' Foundations of Belief . ''

		The latter work has been extensively criticised in the Japanese press .

		`` My Father as I Recall Him , '' by the late Miss
Mamie Dickens	PERSON	, daughter of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, is to be published this month by the
Roxburghe Press	ORGANIZATION	, of West - minster ,
England	LOCATION	.

		The work will contain much new matter relating to the home life of the novelist , and will be illustrated with reproductions of several unpublished photographs .

		The final proofs of the book have been revised by the author 's sister , Mrs.
Perugini	PERSON	. ''

		Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' and its '' Key '' form two vol - umes of the handsome '' Riverside '' edition of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's writings now in course of publication by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Story of Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' is the title of an interesting introductory chap - ter contributed by Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a neat boxed set of three popular volumes by Mr.
William Mathews	PERSON	.

		The set includes '' Hours with Men and Books , '' `` Words : Their Use and Abuse , '' and `` Oratory and Orators . ''

		This house also publishes a new edition of '' Getting on in the World , '' by the same author .

		Miss
Mathilde Blind	ORGANIZATION	died on the
27th of November	DATE	.

		A daughter of
Herr Karl Blind	ORGANIZATION	, the friend of Kossuth and
Mazzini	PERSON	, her life was closely associated with the group of English sympathizers with the revolutionary movement on the Continent .

		She was a woman of much intellectual force , and wrote well in several departments of literature .

		She died at the age of forty-nine . ''

		Poet - Lore '' will be published quarterly hereafter , and the '' initial quarterly number '' just issued is very attractive both as to appearance and contents .

		We wish our
Boston	LOCATION	contemporary all the success it so richly deserves .

		It has always stood for high ideals in literature , and has proved itself well-nigh indispensable to the serious student of poetry and literary criticism . ''

		The Academy '' for
November 14	DATE	appears in a new dress , and under new editorial management .

		It is hand - somely printed , and most of the changes made seem for the better .

		We regret , however , that the reviews are no longer to be signed , and can not but feel that a retro - grade step has been taken in thus abandoning what has been the most distinctive feature of the paper , ever since the late Dr.
Appleton	PERSON	started it in
1869	DATE	.

		Carlyle 's ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	, '' with an interesting Intro - duction by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, and a striking photo - gravure portrait of the author , is presented as the ini - tial volume of Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	,
Lock & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Nineteenth Century Classics . ''

		Mechanically the book is a delight to the eye , being produced at the famous
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	, and is sold at the remarkably low price of seventy -
five cents	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	is the general editor of the series .

		Mr.
Frederick Saunders	PERSON	, of the
Astor Library	ORGANIZATION	, has been retired from active duty by the trustees , and is to receive his salary as a pension for life .

		He has been connected with the library since
1859	DATE	.

		He was one of the earliest and stoutest champions of the struggle for international copyright , and is the author or editor of nearly a score of volumes , of which '' Salad for the Soli - tary '' is probably the best known .

		He is now in his ninetieth year .

		The announcements made for the coming year by the publishers of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' are of unusual interest .

		We are promised , among other good things , a group of articles on the West , by Professor
F. J. Turner	PERSON	, a similar group upon the South , by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, a series on '' The Interpretation of Democ - racy during the Last Thirty Years , '' by Mr.
E. L. God	PERSON	- kin ; a series '' surveying the great activities of the nineteenth century , '' an educational series , an American literature series , and some papers on modern
Greece	LOCATION	, by Professor
B. L. Gildersleeve	PERSON	. ''

		There are others '' as well , but these should be enough to whet the appe - tite of all lovers of good writing and careful thought .

		SECOND EDITION .

		JUST OUT .

		By
F. J. STIMSON	PERSON	-LRB- J. S. of Dale -RRB- . ''

		We are not afraid to predict that '
King Noanett	PERSON	' will take its place in the hearts of the people with such books as
Lorna Doone	PERSON	' and The Little Minister . '

		A most noble book . ''

		JAMES MAC ARTHUR , in the
September	DATE	Bookman . ''

		It is marked in conception and in execution alike by a trait which , without reserve , we may name beauty .

		The quality of charm which pervades the romantic tales of the Old World is just what distinguishes
King Noanett	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The real spirit of the book , the temper which gives it inevitable romantic charm , comes from no documents at all , but straight from nature .

		The beauty of this book in its conception is like the beauty of our woods and our fields , of our flowers and of our streams .

		It is native .

		That is why we love it .

		Subtly rhyth - mical cadences which belong to the essence of lyric prose .

		In substance and in style alike , then , we may welcome '
King Noanett	PERSON	' as a thing of beauty . ''

		Prof.
BARRETT WENDELL	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript . ''

		A book which it is hard to put down until the end is reached .

		The climax is a triumph of clever manipu - lation .

		It is a credit to American letters to have produced such a book .

		We trust that no one will miss the opportunity of making the acquaintance of ' King Noanett . ' ''


New York Examiner	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		We have read few fictions whose interest was so steady , so continuous and so absorbing . '

		King
Noanett	PERSON	' must , however , be read in full to be justly appreciated .

		We sincerely commend the story to our readers . ''


New York	LOCATION	Independent .

		`` And who but an Irishman could have said ` Heigho !

		'T is the women who make the trouble of this life and life worth the trouble . '

		Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	has done his best work in '
King Noanett	PERSON	, ' and in ' Miles
Courtenay	PERSON	' he has added an immortal figure to the characters of fiction . ''

		JAMES
JEFFREY ROCHE	PERSON	, in The Pilot . '' '

		King
Noanett	PERSON	' is a book designed for all ages . ''


New York	LOCATION	Tribune . ''

		So far as American fiction is concerned , '
King Noanett	PERSON	' is far and away the book of the year .

		Certainly nothing fresher or more original has found its way into our literature for many a year .

		The volume possesses a distinct historical value . ''

		LITERARY EDITOR ,

		It is interesting .

		Timbuctoo has always been mysterious , and is less known to En - glish readers than the City of the Sun .

		To the ordinary reader , the very name is but a geographical expression signifying some city in the very farthest corner of the world , and of the inhabitants he knows nothing .

		This book , however , will enlighten him , for it traces the history of the city from the early ages of Egyptian civilization up to the present day , and shows , with the aid of many beautiful illustrations , the rise and fall of the capital of

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's new story has a motive which is believed to be new to recent fiction .

		The tale is African and deals with the conversion of a savage tribe by a missionary and martyr , who does not trust to the ordinary resources of proselytism , but takes his stand upon a literal interpretation of the New Testament promises .

		The story tells how his faith triumphed and how it was strangely supported and justified by a superior Power working through the forces of nature and granting a direct aid which so many deny in these latter days to be vouchsafed to man .

		The keynote of the book is that Faith can , and still does , work miracles .

		Translated by
ARTHUR HORN	PERSON	- BLOW .

		12mo , cloth , gilt top ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` This book is realistic .

		Some say that it is brutally so .

		But the realism is that of Flaubert and not that of Zola .

		There is no plain speaking for the sake of plain speaking .

		Every detail is justified in the fact that it illuminates either the motives or the actions of the man and woman who here stand revealed .

		It is a painful book .

		Not that there is an absence of sunshine in it .

		But it is deadly true .

		The author holds the mirror up to nature , and the reader , as he sees his own experiences duplicated in passage after passage , has something of the same sensa - tion as all of us know on a first reading of
George Meredith	PERSON	's ' Egoist . '

		Reading these pages is like being out in the country on a dark night in a storm .

		Suddenly a flash of lightning comes and every detail of your surroundings is revealed . ''

N. Y. Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the delineation of character , and in tracing the psychological developments of actual , living , breathing , human beings , the author of '' Quo Vadis '' shows an almost inimitable power .

		The portrait of Petronius is alone a masterpiece of which the greatest word-painters of any age might be proud .

		It is one of the greatest books of our day .

		Mr.

Sienkiewicz	PERSON	turning to Roman and classical scenes , as he does in his latest story , '' Quo Vadis . ''

		Any regret that the reader may feel , however , is certain to vanish utterly when the full fascination of this marvellous romance is allowed to exercise its potent sway .

		... '' Quo Vadis '' is assuredly a romance on a grand scale , and every chapter in it is eloquent with meaning ... Certain memorable scenes , like the feasting in the imperial palace , the burning of
Rome	LOCATION	, the rescue of
Lygia	LOCATION	, the Christian maiden , these will hold their place in memory with unfading color , and are to be reckoned among the significant triumphs of narrative art .

		Among the many suggestions from the busy - bodies of two continents concerning the vacancy made by Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's death in the
Poet Laureateship of England	LOCATION	, there was but one that deserved serious consideration .

		After it had become evident that neither Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	nor
William Morris	PERSON	would be willing to occupy the vacant post , there was probably no other English poet among the living so deserving of the appointment as the author of '' The Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		We believe it was '' The
Satur	PERSON	- day Review '' that had the honor of putting forward the claims of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	for this distinction .

		How fortunate it would have been had the suggestion been heeded , became sufficiently obvious when the poetaster upon whose shoulders fell the ample mantle of Ten - 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, nyson published his first official effusion .

		Since then , we are informed , it is an open secret in
England	LOCATION	that the injunction of silence has been laid upon the Laureate as far as his court func - tion is concerned , and that his attempts at offi - cial utterance are gently but firmly suppressed .

		How fittingly
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	would have graced the position , and how worthily he might have carried on the noble tradition of his two immediate predecessors , we are now reminded by the news of his death , and by the review of his life-work that this sorrowful piece of intelli - gence naturally prompts us to make .

		Coventry
Kearsey Deighton Patmore	PERSON	was born at
Woodford	LOCATION	,
July 2 , 1823	DATE	.

		The son of a well-known editor and man-of-letters , he de - veloped at an early age a marked literary tal - ent of his own , and his first volume of '' Poems '' was published in
1844	DATE	, the year of his majority .

		In
1847	DATE	he received an appointment as assist - ant librarian in the British Museum , and occu - pied a post in that institution for about twenty years .

		After his retirement he purchased a large estate in
Sussex	LOCATION	, and settled at
Hastings	LOCATION	, where he lived for the remainder of his life , and where he built a large Catholic church .

		As a contributor to '' The Germ , '' in
1850	DATE	, he was associated , in a way , with the
Preraphael	PERSON	- ite movement , although hardly identified with it .

		Upon this point
Buxton Foreman	PERSON	remarks : '' Any novice who might be told that Mr.
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	was a Preraphaelite poet would stare aghast if the informant , after giv - ing him samples of Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	's work , should then turn to the poetry of Mr.
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	and say , ' This also is Preraphaelite poetry . ' '

		But
Preraphaelitism	PERSON	has never submitted to ex - act definition , and if one corner of its mantle is stretched to cover such a poet as
Thomas Wool	PERSON	- ner , another corner may fairly enough give shelter to
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	.

		A second volume of verse , '' Tamerton Church-Tower and Other Poems , '' was pub - lished by
Patmore	PERSON	in
1853	DATE	; and the year fol - lowing witnessed the appearance of a first instalment of '' The Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' the poem by which he is best known .

		This work grew in volume year by year , and was revised over and over again to satisfy the fastidious taste of the poet , until in
1878	DATE	it had assumed a definitive form , in which '' The Victories of Love '' -LRB- published separately in
1863	DATE	-RRB- was incorporated .

		Meanwhile ,
Patmore	PERSON	had written a volume of '' Odes '' -LRB- 1868 -RRB- , '' The Unknown Eros and Other Odes '' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- , and an essay on `` English Metrical Law '' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- .

		We should also mention the fact that he edited the memoirs of ''
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	, '' and also '' The Children 's Garland , '' the latter an anthology prepared for the '' Golden Treasury '' series .

		Those who wish to study
Patmore	PERSON	's poetical work as a whole should possess themselves of the final edition of
1886	DATE	, in four volumes .

		Those , on the other hand , who are content to know the poet only in the quintessence of his production should seek the '' Florilegium Amantis '' vol - ume , edited by Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, or the more recent '' Poetry of Pathos and Delight , '' selected and edited by Mrs.
Alice Meynell	PERSON	.

		Patmore died at
Lymington	LOCATION	, on the twenty - sixth of
November	DATE	, at the age of seventy-three .

		The enjoyment of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's work , although very deep when once attained to , is to a certain extent the result of an acquired taste .

		It takes some effort and some power of penetration to discern the whole subtlety of his thought and the whole beauty of his imagination .

		He is , too , very uneven , and the reader who at the start chances upon certain pages in which bald - ness and triviality seem to reign supreme may well be repelled from further examination and too hastily conclude that the poet has no mes - sage for his ear .

		Suppose , for example , that the following lines first arrest the reader 's eye : '' While thus I grieved , and kissed her glove , My man brought in her note to say , Papa had bid her send his love , And would I dine with them next day ? ''

		One might , indeed , have a good excuse for thinking the writer of such verse undeserving of any further attention .

		But let him persevere , and his reward will not be long delayed .

		He will soon come across such a passage as this : '' And round her happy footsteps blow The authentic airs of Paradise , '' and the whole question will be settled .

		No one but a true poet could possibly have written those verses , or these : '' The heartless and intolerable Indignity of ' earth to earth , ' '' or these called '' The Spirit 's Epochs '' : '' Not in the crises of events Of compass 'd hopes , or fears fulfill 'd , Or acts of gravest consequence , Are life 's delight and depth revealed .

		The day of days was not the day That went before , or was postponed ; The night Death took our lamp away Was not the
night	TIME	on which we groan ' d. I drew my bride , beneath the moon , Across my threshold ; happy hour !

		But , ah , the walk that afternoon We saw the water-flags in flower ! ''

		The essential purposes of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	find expression in his own verse , in this prayer , for example :
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 '' Thou Primal Love , who grantest wings And voices to the woodland birds , Grant me the power of saying things Too simple and too sweet for words , '' and in the aim thus set forth : ' ' Elated oft by such free songs I think with utterance free to raise That hymn for which the whole world longs A worthy hymn in woman 's praise .

		A hymn bright-noted like a bird 's , Arousing these song - sleepy times With rhapsodies of perfect words Ruled by returning kiss of rhymes . ''

		That he has done both of these things is beyond dispute . ''

		The Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' sings the praise of woman in just such '' a hymn bright - noted like a bird 's , '' and almost every page of his work gives evidence of his gift for express - ing '' things too simple and too sweet for words . '' ''

		For even an hour To hold possession of the height Of nameless pathos and delight '' is a power granted to but few poets in as marked a degree as to
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	, and there are few more exquisite pleasures than to stand in spirit upon this very height of which he holds possession .

		The air is so tenuous that breath is difficult for one unaccustomed to the medium , but there is a sense of calm and spirit - ual freedom unattainable upon any lower level , and amply rewarding the effort of the climber .

		Those who have been lifted to this spiritual elevation by
Patmore	PERSON	's song are very loyal to their poet .

		Mr.
Buxton Foreman	PERSON	passes sober judgment in the following terms : '' The lasting merit of his work is that it deals with love from the modern and domestic point of view in a manner that is at once manly , exquisitely refined , and wholly sincere and impassioned . ''

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	says : ''
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	's voice is single in his day , and single in our literature .

		It makes part of no choir loud by numbers , and so it needs an attentive ear .

		To that attentive ear it sounds alone , as the divin - est voice of our time . ''

		And Mr.
Euskin	PERSON	, in the familiar passage that has probably done more than any other piece of criticism to send readers to
Patmore	LOCATION	, says to us : '' You can not read him too often or too carefully ; as far as I know , he is the only living poet who always strengthens and purifies ; the others sometimes darken , and nearly always depress and discour - age , the imagination they deeply seize . ''

		The poet who can evoke such tributes as these is not likely to be forgotten .

		While we may not group
Patmore	PERSON	with the six major poets of the later Victorian period , his station is but just below their
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, and his shrine is no less secure than theirs .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE AUTHENTIC HISTORY OP THE JAPAN-CHINA WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your recent editorial article on the condition of lit - erary affairs in
Japan	LOCATION	has suggested to me that your readers might care to know that there has just been published at
Yokohama	LOCATION	a work which purports to be an '' absolutely authentic '' account of the recent war .

		Its title is '' Heroic
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and it is the work of two au - thors
F. Warrington Eastlake	PERSON	, Ph.D. , and
Y. Yamada	PERSON	, LL.B. ,
Principal of the Chautauquan Association of Japan	ORGANIZATION	, both of whom are well qualified to write such a book .

		The authors claim that '' not only have the Im - perial Household , Foreign , War , and
Navy Departments	ORGANIZATION	given the authors free access to all documents , but every word in the book has been thoroughly and re - peatedly revised by the authorities concerned . ''

		It is , therefore , the first '' precise , correct history of the war '' which has yet been '' published in any language , '' and has thus a special value to all students of history .

		It is valuable , moreover , as a record , not only of the general history of that war , so important , but also of a great many '' brave deeds '' of individual officers and soldiers , and of small bands of the Japanese army .

		As the au - thors say in the preface , '' there is one phase of bravery which seems peculiar to this country .

		It is this , and this alone , which we have tried to emphasize and thus bring to the notice of the world . ''

		Such '' simple and unassuming '' deeds illustrate '' the qualities of martial heroism , implicit soldierly obedience , unflinching sense of duty , noble unselfishness , and deathless courage '' which go to make up the well-known '' spirit of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Yamato-damashii -RRB- .

		The book contains about 570 pages and 127 illustra - tions and maps ; is well printed , and sells for
five yen	MONEY	.

		Its publishers are
Messrs. Kelly & Walsh	ORGANIZATION	,
Yokohama	LOCATION	.

		Although the stories of '' brave deeds , '' and the reiter - ated fulsome praise , become rather monotonous , yet the book is interesting , and merits a wide circulation in
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	countries .

		It shows the staying qualities of the soldiery who must maintain the position of
Japan	LOCATION	as the key of
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		Men have loved women after many ways : Purely , as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, making love a prayer For
Beatrice	PERSON	; in a wild despair , As Petrarch loved , who sang for

		Kingdoms and states , honor and faith , have stood Unshaken till some fatal moment when A woman 's smile , alluring , shone above , O'er-dazzling fame or valor , wealth or good .

		LANG 'S
LOCKHART	PERSON	.

		* It is fitting that the life of the best British biographer since
Boswell	PERSON	should be exception - ally well-written ; and we are glad to say that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Life of
Lockhart	LOCATION	'' is , what we hoped it would be , a fit shelf-companion for his hero 's own magnum opus .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has now tried his hand at about every sort of book - making , save lexicography .

		His '' spoor , '' as a recent bard rather ungraciously grumbles , is `` over every mortal thing '' ; and it is only natural if his later work has heretofore shown occasional signs of the jaded brain and the reluctant pen .

		But this time he has found a theme to his taste .


Lockhart	PERSON	was an interesting -LRB- we do n't say en - gaging -RRB- member of a remarkably interesting circle one that has left posterity a richer legacy of racy personalia than perhaps any other literary circle or congeries of literary circlets whatsoever .


Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Jeffrey	PERSON	,
Wilson	PERSON	,
Croker	PERSON	,
Maginn	PERSON	, Gait , De Quincey ,
Ballantyne	PERSON	,
Murray	PERSON	, Constable ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Tom Moore	PERSON	, Hay don , Hunt ,
Keats	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Southey	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	!

		these are surely names to conjure memory with ; and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	pursues his task with the zest -LRB- if not the animus -RRB- of a Jeffreyan Scotch reviewer on the trail of an English bard .

		His table of contents -LRB- a conveniently full and ingeniously enticing one -RRB- is better reading than many a man 's book .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book , we learn , grew out of the publisher 's wish that he should prepare an edi - tion of
Lockhart	PERSON	's life of
Scott	LOCATION	.

		The introduc - tory chapter to that work swelled into the present biography .

		The documents used in its preparation are , chiefly , the Abbottsford and
Milton Lockhart MSS.	PERSON	, mainly eleven volumes of letters to
Lockhart	PERSON	, and his own letters to members of his family ; letters of
Lockhart	PERSON	to his life-long friend , Mr.
Jonathan Christie	PERSON	-LRB- of Chalk Farm memory -RRB- ; an article by Mr.
Gleig	PERSON	in the '' Quarterly Review '' -LRB- the sole authority on
Lockhart	PERSON	's boyhood -RRB- ; letters of
Lockhart	LOCATION	to
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Dean Milman	PERSON	, Professor
Wilson	PERSON	, Sir
W. Laidlaw	PERSON	, and others .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	re - grets the necessary omission of certain let - ters , notably those from
Lockhart	LOCATION	to
Croker	LOCATION	, which '' may some day be given to the world , '' and a series to
Southey	PERSON	-LRB- of slight importance * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF

		we fancy -RRB- which he has been unable to trace .

		Enough letters and to spare are , however , given to enable the reader who does not care to ac - cept Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's conclusions unquestioned to descry for himself the moral lineaments of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's much-canvassed and in life somewhat aloof-keeping and inscrutable son-in-law .

		Lock - hart assuredly did not wear his heart upon his sleeve , nor did he , as man or as reviewer , suffer fools gladly .

		As the world saw him , he was reserved , stiff , satirical , one who habitually harbored more scorn than charity for the foi - bles of men .

		Strangers mistrusted '' the laugh aboot the sere wed-up mouth of him , that fules ca 'd no canny , for they couldna thole the meanin ' o ` t. '' Of his inborn turn for ridicule and mischief there can be no doubt ; and the work he sometimes put his hand to consorted ill with his ''
Hidalgo	PERSON	airs . ''

		But he was never -LRB- even in his
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Flegeljahre * -RRB- the coldly malignant literary bravo , the '' Scorpion '' critic contemporary fancy painted him .

		He was cer - tainly not a man who would , as a competent judge said of his yoke-fellow
Croker	PERSON	, '' go a hundred miles through sleet and snow , in a
December	DATE
night	TIME	, to search a parish register for the sake of showing that a man was illegitimate , or a woman older than she said she was . ''

		Croker wrote as if he hated his victim ; Lock - hart never did .

		Croker 's raillery sprang from sheer love of inflicting pain ;
Lockhart	PERSON	's from a natural turn for banter .

		In fact ,
Lockhart	PERSON	went on carelessly and light-heartedly from youth to middle age , caricaturing his oppo - nents , his friends , and himself ; and the habit bore its natural fruit .

		Many who were hit dis - liked him for it ; and many who were not hit disliked him because they feared they would be .

		Still , we do not think
Lockhart	PERSON	was in general an amiable man , or that his early '' squibberies '' in
Maga	PERSON	were altogether free from malice .

		But he has certainly been painted many shades blacker than he deserved to be .

		To be misjudged of the world is the common fate of shy men ; and
Lockhart	PERSON	was , by all ac - counts of him , his own included , as shy as a wild duck . ''

		I am , '' he once wrote , '' the shyest man alive . ''

		Now of shyness there are two * In
1838	DATE	Lockhart wrote to
Haydon	LOCATION	, as to his early perform - ances in '' Black wood '' : `` In the first place I was a raw boy , who had never had the least connection either with politics or controversies of any kind , when , arriving in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in
1817	DATE	, I found my friend
John Wilson	PERSON	-LRB- ten years my senior -RRB- busied in helping
Blackwood	PERSON	out of a scrape he had got into with some editors of his Magazine , and on
Wilson	PERSON	's asking me to try my hand at some squibberies in his aid , I sat down to do so with as little malice as if the assigned subject had been the Court of

		THE DIAL 373 main varieties : that which springs from tim - idity , and that which is wedded to pride of the stiffest and touchiest order .


Lockhart	PERSON	's was of the latter sort .

		He himself once -LRB- in a moment of introspection probably -RRB- neatly described shyness as '' arrogance not screwed up '' ; and the definition seems to us to go to the root of his own character .

		He was essentially the shy , proud man ; the '' unclubable '' man , who -LRB- how - ever cordial and companionable in his family circle or with an intimate friend or two -RRB- be - comes straightway as responsive as a polyp and as enlivening as a tombstone in general com - pany .

		This outwardly frosty -LRB- yet , for all one usually knows , inwardly friendly and even jovial -RRB- creature is no rara avis .

		We have all met him , and been benumbed by him , and wished ourselves -LRB- and him -RRB- in a warmer vicin - ity .

		Addison , tradition says , was much such a man .

		Of course the world judged
Lockhart	PERSON	as it saw him calling him , as
Redding	ORGANIZATION	says in his Memoirs , '' ill-natured , sarcastic , and I know not what besides . ''

		We suspect Lock - hart , who cared as little as any man for Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	's opinions , did not chafe much under these imputations .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	notes that Lock - hart 's customary manner was oddly blended with a certain turn for conviviality .

		This sav - ing trait -LRB- manifest often enough at college revels and bacchanalian suppers with
Wilson	PERSON	and the '' Shepherd '' -RRB- sometimes unexpectedly broke through his habitual crust of '' almost fierce reserve , '' to the wonder of all beholders not his intimates .

		Such an occasion is cited by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	: '' It is remembered that he once came unexpectedly to
Milton Lockhart	PERSON	, when a great dinner of farmers was going on , that at first he shrank into his shell with
Hidalgo	PERSON	airs , or to speak
Scottice	PERSON	, ' with the black dowg on his back . '

		Suddenly , when the sweets appeared , one of the yeomen pinched him violently on the leg , and in a voice hoarse with emotion , murmured , ' Gosh , man !

		Two , puddens !

		Yon '11 be a kick abune the common . '

		This unexpected assault and enthusiasm sent
John	PERSON	off into a hearty fit of laughter .

		He shook off the black dog , and , for the rest of the evening , was the life and soul of the party . ''

		In fine , the world at large saw little of Lock - hart but his failings .

		Those who knew him best loved him most ; and these have testified to his essential truthfulness and high-minded - ness , to his readiness to make sacrifices for others , to his loyalty to old ties of friendship and affection , and to his generosity even to stran - gers in their hour of need .

		These high qualities were crossed and veiled by certain asperities of manner and temperament ; and unfortu - nately the circumstances of his entry into what was then very literally the arena of letters were such as to call those asperities into full and mischievous play .

		The impression made by
Lockhart	PERSON	on people not wholly strangers to him is thus described in the well-known '' Times '' article on him , which is , we think , rightly ascribed to Mr.
Elwin	PERSON	-LRB- editor of the '' Quar - terly '' -RRB- , though Mr.
Lang	PERSON	seems to favor the more common attribution of it to Dean
Milman	PERSON	or Lady Eastlake : '' It was characteristic of
Lockhart	PERSON	's peculiar individ - uality , that , whenever he was at all known , whether by man or woman , by poet , man of business , or man of the world , he touched the hidden chord of romance in all .

		No man less affected the poetical , the mysterious , or the sentimental ; no man less affected anything ; yet as he stole stiffly away from the knot which , if he had not enlivened , he had hushed , there was not one who did not confess that a being had passed before them who had stirred all the pulses of the imagination , and realized what is generally only ideal in the portrait of a man . ''

		The same article affords us a glimpse of the less gracious Lockhart : '' Those whose acquaintance he was expressly invited to make , would find no access allowed them to his mind , and go disappointed away , knowing only that they had seen one of the most interesting , most mysterious , but most chilling of men , for their very deference had made him retire further from them . ''

		Comparing
Scott	PERSON	with
Lockhart	PERSON	, the same writer continues : '' In outward manner no two men indeed could be more different .

		Scott , frank , easy , accessible , the least awful great man ever known ...
Lockhart	PERSON	, slow at first , retiring , almost repelling , till the thaw of kindly or friendly feelings had warmed and kindled his heart .

		But in tastes , in political principles , in conviviality , in active life , in the enjoyment of Scottish scenery and sports , in the love of letters for letters ' sake , with a sovereign contempt for the pedantry of authorship , warm attachments , even in the love of brute beasts there was the closest sympathy . ''

		Of
Lockhart	PERSON	the critic , the same writer con - cludes forgetful for the moment of his hero 's unhallowed pranks at the expense of the '' Lak - ers '' and the '' Cockney School '' : '' ... yet if any great work of genius appeared , it was one to him his kindred spirit was kindled at once , his admiration and sympathy threw off all trammels .

		We have known where he has resisted rebuke or remon - strance , to do justice to the work of political antago - nists that impartial homage was at once freely , boldly , lavishly paid . ''

		The spectacle of one
Scot	PERSON	standing up for another is no novel one ; and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, while admitting pretty freely his hero 's imperfections , is confessedly his advocate where advocacy is called for which is pretty often .


Lockhart	PERSON	's course as a reviewer for '' Blackwood '' is ex - tenuated rather than defended .

		Touching these 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, iniquities , or levities , of his client 's , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	says , passim : '' For too many years
Lockhart	PERSON	has been made the solitary scapegoat of
Wilson	PERSON	, and of
Blackwood	LOCATION	in gen - eral .

		... To love of mischief , of freedom to indulge caprice , to friendship for
Wilson	PERSON	, and regard for Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	, one may most plausibly attribute Lock - hart 's stormy , and often regretted , but never broken constancy to
Maga	PERSON	.

		... He began to write too young , he enjoyed a latitude far too wide , and he had , in Wil - son , an elder associate and friend whose genius was perhaps the most unbalanced in literature ... His pleas of youth , of association with an elder friend who should have set him a better example , and of freedom from personal malice , may be accepted even by severe judges ... When all this is done there abides an amount of wrong that is not to be palliated , not to be smiled away . ''

		To these special pleas may be added the general one that '' they all did it . ''

		The literati of the day were given to abusing one another like theologians ; and young
Lockhart	PERSON	only followed the model set him in the all-powerful ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' by the great
Jeffrey	PERSON	-LRB- vide the review of `` Christabel '' -RRB- , the Whig Aristarchus and '' first of British critics . ''

		Even
Coleridge	PERSON	wrote of
Maturin	PERSON	's `` Bertram '' which had superseded his own '' Zapolya '' at Covent Gar - den as '' ... this superfetation of blasphemy upon nonsense , this felo de se and thief captain , this loathsome and leprous confluence of robbery , adultery , murder , and cowardly assassination , whose best deed is the having saved his betters from the degradation of hanging him , by turning
Jack Ketch	PERSON	to himself . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	admits that
Lockhart	PERSON	was '' con - stitutionally a mocker '' ; and we find no reason to doubt that the latter , when he tried his ` pren - tice hand at literary scurrilities in '' Ebony , '' went willingly and even gleefully to work .

		That he had no little natural aptitude and inclination for the task certain early letters of his indicate .

		They indicate also , to our think - ing , that the young Oxonian -LRB- `` mischievous Oxford puppy , '' honest
Hogg	PERSON	called him -RRB- was a just bit of a prig , and a rather sourly sarcastic one at that .

		No liberal sweet-dispositioned youth , however literate , would , for instance , have gratuitously styled
Bristol	LOCATION	'' an abomin - able stinking stye of artisans , '' as
Lockhart	PERSON	did in a letter to
Christie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , artisans and trades-people generally the young man -LRB- who , be it added , could boast , besides his brilliant acquirements , the proverbial Scotch '' ell of genealogy '' -RRB- seems to have regarded with some disdain .

		After returning to
Glasgow	LOCATION	he wrote gloomily to Christie : '' ... It is really a miserable thing to be without friends ; out of my own family I have not a soul here I care for .

		The manners of men who talk perpetually of calicoes and raw sugar , and of chemical-botanical vul - gar women , are intolerable to me .

		I am fain to take all my walks in solitude , '' etc. .

		Glasgow manners are again fleered at in a subsequent letter : '' ... T ' other day I went to a
Glasgow	LOCATION	ball , almost , I may say , for the first time .

		On entering the room a buzz of ' sugars , ' ' cottons , ' ' coffees , ' ' pullicates , ' assailed my ears from the four winds of heaven .

		Every now and then the gemmen were deserting their partners , and rushing into the caper course to talk over the samples of the morning .

		One sedulous dog seemed to insist on another 's putting his finger into his waistcoat pocket .

		The being did so , and forthwith put the tip to his lips , but the countenance was so mealy that I could not tell whether it smacked of sugar or Genseng . ''

		After settling at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Lockhart	PERSON	wrote to Christie in his characteristic vein of the then swarming literati of that city : '' Certainly if the name
Athens	LOCATION	had been derived from the Goddess of Printing not from the Goddess of Wisdom no city in the world could with greater jus - tice -LRB- than could
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-RRB- lay claim to the appella - tion .

		An author elsewhere is a being somewhat at least out of the common run .

		Here he is truly a week-day man .

		Every other body you jostle is at least the father of an octavo or two , and it is odds if you ever sit down to dinner in a company of a dozen , without having to count three or four quarto makers in the circle .

		Poets are as plenty as blackberries indeed much more so , unless blackberries mean sloes .

		And as for travellers good Jehovah !

		I think I am safe in saying that there have appeared at least twenty different lucubrations in that way concerning
Paris	LOCATION	alone within these last eigh - teen months .

		Old crambe-recocta stuff out of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	and Sir
Joshua	PERSON	spouted by one boy of eigh - teen who had never in his life seen but one or two Edin - burgh exhibitions and profound disquisitions on na - tional character and
Napoleon	PERSON	by another , who never had seen the tenth milestone from
Auld Reekie	PERSON	, or read anything better than
Jeffray	PERSON	and
Cobbett	PERSON	's Parliamen - tary Debates ... '' The same letter contains a literary note of some interest : '' ... I dined the other day at his -LRB- Sir
W. Hamil	PERSON	- ton 's -RRB- house in company with two violent
Lakers Wilson	PERSON	for one , and a friend of his , a most strange crea - ture , for the other .

		His name is De Quincey ; he was of
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		After passing one half of an examina - tion which has never , according to the common report , been equalled , he took the terror of the schools , and fled for it to the Lakes .

		There he has formed the closest intimacy with
Wordsworth	PERSON	and all his worthies .

		After dinner he set down two snuff-boxes on the table ; one , I soon observed , contained opium pills of these he swal - lowed one every now and then , while we drank our half - bottle apiece .


Wilson	PERSON	and he were both as enthusiastic concerning the ' Excursion ' as you could wish ... ''
Lockhart	PERSON	's character is not , of course , to be judged mainly in the light of the foregoing youthful effusions .

		We have cited them merely as showing a certain natural predisposition in him for the work he did as a young man in

		The brilliant , sarcastic , somewhat flippant tyro who , in
Maga	PERSON	, pointed his wanton quill at the '' Cockney School '' and the '' Lakers '' -LRB- many of whom were '' better men than himself , '' he later frankly acknowledged -RRB- , was , as ample evi - dence shows , a widely different man from the riper and mellower
Lockhart	PERSON	who in
1853	DATE	re - tired '' Over-worked , over-hurried , Over-Croker 'd , over-Murray 'd '' from his twenty-eight years ' management of the '' Quarterly . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's estimate of Lock - hart , as man and as writer , seems to us in the main as just as it is thoughtful and impartial .

		He has given us a delightful book ; and it is with regret that one takes leave of its pleas - antly diversified pages .

		In point of biograph - ical material , there has been almost an embar - rassment of riches ; and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has sifted and marshalled his documents most satisfac - torily .

		The work may perhaps be styled -LRB- as
Carlyle	LOCATION	styles
Lockhart	PERSON	's '' Scott '' -RRB- not so much a composition as a compilation well done ; but the pages in which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	appears as author proper , rather than editor , are by no means the least readable ones .

		He has plainly the right Caledonian turn for biographical writing ; and we trust that , now his hand is in , he will give us more of it ere long .

E. G. J. CURTIS	PERSON	ON THE CONSTITUTION .

		* After an interval of forty years from the appearance of the first portion of Mr.
George Ticknor Curtis	PERSON	's treatise on the Constitution , which was republished in
1889	DATE	as Volume I. of the '' Constitutional History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' the material left by him is now pub - lished as Volume II. , under the editorship of Mr.
Joseph C. Clarkson	PERSON	.

		Notwithstanding this lapse of time , the new volume is distin - guished by the same pleasing style which was such an acceptable feature of the former work .

		But as regards substance , there is great dis - parity between the two volumes .

		The earlier one treats of what may be considered as but * CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		By
George Ticknor Curtis	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Volume II .

		Ed - ited by
Joseph Culbertson Clarkson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		one epoch in our constitutional history that of the formation and adoption of the consti - tution .

		The text of the new volume , cover - ing the succeeding period of upwards of eighty years , occupies but little more than half the space of the first volume , and discusses a part only of the important constitutional questions that have arisen during that period .

		The author did not plan this volume upon a scale proportionate to that of the first ; and it was never completed according to his original plan .

		Some disappointments in the treatise will there - fore be felt by those who would have been pleased to see a complete constitutional history from the pen of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	, following the plan of his first volume , and expanding , if necessary , into four or more volumes .

		His minuteness of explanation and lucidity of illus - tration would have enlivened many of the naturally dry episodes of our national history .

		It is a matter of regret , not only that he did not live to finish his work as he had planned it , but that it had not been laid out on a more generous scale and executed accordingly .

		But in so far as Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	has , in this supple - mental work , taken up and discussed the con - stitutional questions of the period , he is , as usual , instructive and entertaining .

		The mea - greness of such discussions is in part compen - sated for by the addition of a group of con - stitutional documents of the highest value , including the Non-importation Agreement of
1774	DATE	, the Address to the King of the same year , the Declaration of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the army in
1775	DATE	, the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	, the Tariff Act of
1789	DATE	, the provisional and final Constitutions of the
Confederate States	LOCATION	, and a reprint of Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's excel - lent Bibliography of the Constitution .

		A col - lection of these documents , with the
Declara	LOCATION	- tion of Independence , the Articles of Confed - eration , and the annotated Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, as found here , would , if printed by itself , find ready acceptance by the public , and their insertion as an appendix to Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's work is most timely , and will insure hearty commendations to the learned editor of the new volume .

		Disregarding chronological order , Mr.
Cur	PERSON	- tis discusses by '' groups '' several subjects as they have presented themselves at various times since the inception of our system .

		The changes in current opinion concerning the nature of our constitutional system are traced in a generalized way .

		The question of the extent to which the '' league of friendship '' of THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the Confederation period gave place to a na - tional government is well illustrated by the calm and judicious comments of the author , who cleverly shows the weaknesses in the argu - ments advanced by the '' State Sovereignty '' school of writers .

		Both the friends and the opponents of the constitution , when it was under consideration , agreed that the proposed new system would substitute a nation for a league ; and , as our author points out , while in later years theorists have advanced extreme views in regard to
State	ORGANIZATION	sovereignty , delegated powers , nullification and secession , still the administration of the government in all its departments , legislative , executive , and judi - cial , has continuously proceeded upon the lines of the national theory , as expounded by its friends in 1787-1789 .

		But the theories of the secession school are unsatisfactory and de - ceptive in themselves .

		They are confuted by the plain provisions of the Constitution and the mode and circumstances of its adoption .

		The ratifications of the national constitution by the people of the original Thirteen States were unqualified and unconditional , without either express or implied reservation of a right to revoke .

		The people of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, like those of several other States , accompanied their adoption of the constitution with a pro- posal for immediate amendments , thus evinc - ing their understanding , not only that their ratification was unconditional , but that the instrument thus adopted could be changed only in one of the modes provided by itself .

		President
Jackson	PERSON	's position in reference to nullification , and the terms of his proclama - tion to the nullifiers , are warmly commended by our commentator , while the grounds of his veto of the charter extension of the
United States Bank	ORGANIZATION	are criticised with a fine discrim - ination , showing that the President misapplied a constitutional rule which might have been properly invoked had the facts been different .

		In a very clear and happy manner , Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	explains the dual character of our con - stitutional system , and illustrates the merits of both its national and local departments , and the mode in which each has contributed to our national success .

		But he is not uni - formly clear in his analysis , and his discussion of the question as to who were the '' People of the United States '' that ordained and established this dual system , is vague , and reaches no apparent result .

		He does not agree with the current opinion that that '' Peo - ple '' were the mass of those inhabiting and acting jurally in all the Thirteen States ; and he seeks to find confirmation for his views in the opinion of
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	, in
McCulloch	ORGANIZATION	vs.
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		Referring to the adoption of the constitution by the conventions of the people , assembling in their several States ,
Marshall	PERSON	assumed the entire propriety of that mode of action , but said that the measures thus adopted '' do not , on that account , cease to be the measures of the people themselves , or be - come the measures of the
State	ORGANIZATION	governments ; the government proceeds directly from the peo - ple . ''

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	is quite clear that the adop - tion of the constitution was not a measure of '' the
State	ORGANIZATION	governments . ''

		He repudiates the '' State sovereignty '' theory in unequivocal terms , and emphasizes the features in which the States have been made subordinate to the Federal government .

		But he seems to draw the inference , without stating it in terms , that the establishment of the system was the work of thirteen separate and distinct '' peoples . ''


Marshall	PERSON	, however , spoke not of '' peoples , '' but of '' the people , '' evidently entertaining no other idea than that of one people , operating at once in thirteen groups , to effectuate one common object .

		It is perhaps with this idea of thirteen separate peoples in mind , that Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	refers to some of the provisions of the constitution as '' compacts and agreements '' between the States .

		He says : '' The idea of compacts , covenants , and agreements , between the separate States , as members of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	as the representative of all the States collectively , is embedded in the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	and forms its principal strength . ''

		In this he puts himself in direct conflict with Mr.
James Wilson	PERSON	, whose views he praises without stint in his first volume , and who said that he saw no trace of compact in the constitution .

		Nor does it seem easy to make these declarations of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	consist with his statement , in this new volume , that '' the process of amending the constitution seems scarcely reconcilable with the hypothesis that the constitution is a compact between in - dependent sovereign States . ''

		A clear and unequivocal statement of a logical deduction from the text and the history of the constitu - tion , may be found in
Wilson	PERSON	's opinion in
Chisholm vs. Georgia	LOCATION	: '' We may then infer that the people of the
United States	LOCATION	intended to bind the several States by the legislative power of the
National Government	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The authoritative command of a lawful sovereign rises far above the grade of a compact .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 The territorial clause of the constitution , the government of the territories and the admis - sion of new States , are subjects which Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	uses skilfully as leading up to a consid - eration of the debates on the
Missouri	LOCATION	question , the compromise which resulted , the Dred
Scott	PERSON	decision , the slavery controversy , and the civil war .

		Other cognate questions are discussed , among them the reconstruction measures , which are freely criticised .

		But space can not be here given for further extracts from his text .

		The subject of the disputed election of
1876	DATE	, and the settlement effected by the Electoral Com - mission , lies so well out of the field of consti - tutional interpretation that in a treatise like this it might be properly dismissed with a brief reference to that fact .

		The account here given of the party schemes and operations which pre - ceded the creation of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and which is borrowed from a partisan book on the subject , is out of place in the constitu - tional treatise of a jurist .

		The constitutionality of protective tariff leg - islation is earnestly maintained and forcibly advocated by Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	; and the history given by him of the inception and consumma - tion of the first tariff act under the constitution shows that at the beginning of our revenue leg - islation the element of protection to American industry was considered a proper incident of a tariff for revenue , and that its entire constitu - tionality was assumed .

		The 4th of
July , 1788	DATE	, being the first national anniversary after the Constitution had been ratified by the necessary number of States to give it effect , was signal - ized by a public parade in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, in which the workers in the mechanic arts exhib - ited mottoes indicating their expectation that among the first fruits of the new system would be the adoption of protective legislation ; and the next following national anniversary was distinguished by President
Washington	LOCATION	's ap - proval of the first tariff act , which in terms embodied the protective theory .

J. M. Barrie	PERSON	's writings is published by subscription by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		In appearance it closely resembles the recent editions of
Stevenson	PERSON	and
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	also published by this house .

		There are to be eight volumes , each illustrated with two photogravures .

		Each volume is to have a specially-written preface by Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	. ''

		Auld Licht Idylls '' and '' Better Dead '' form the first volume of this edition , and the second gives us the ` pren - tice story , '' When a Man 's Single . ''

		A HASH ADVENTURE .

		* That man is deserted by his good angel who begins to write a '' History of Oratory and Orators '' with no adequate idea of history and only the most general conception of oratory .

		Such a man is naturally compelled to fill up his book with the third element namely , ora - tors .

		Then if he have no gift of style , but , in place of it , access to a number of works on the subject , he will be likely to produce a book something like Mr.
Henry Hardwicke	PERSON	's .

		It seems absurd , even painful , that a man should offer the public a good-sized book on some subject , who manifestly has , not merely no respectable knowledge of the matter itself , but no conception even of the purport of his title .

		And yet , so far as this book informs us , Mr.
Hardwicke	PERSON	has no idea of oratory as dis - tinct from the persons who delivered orations , and no idea of history as distinct from chrono - logical sequence .

		Such being the case , it is hardly worth mentioning that he is not espe - cially well-read in his subject , although he makes large quotations with infrequent mention of their sources ; that he has such ideas on his - tory that the treatise on oratory by the contem - porary of Theseus , and the oration pronounced by
Romulus	PERSON	at the bidding of his grandfather , are mentioned -LRB- pp .

		v. , 25 -RRB- in the same spirit as the works of
Burke	PERSON	and
Webster	PERSON	; that his only notion of criticism is to apply the words `` vigorous , '' `` florid , '' `` vehement , '' `` brilliant , '' '' ornamental , '' etc. , or else to extract from
Goodrich	PERSON	and others ; and that in all other re - spects he is wholly unequal to the creditable carrying out of the task he has imposed upon himself .

		His work is a history of oratory in three respects only : it deals with orators ; it recognizes a time-element ; it treats in separate chapters the orators of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		So far , the reader may rest well assured as to what this book is not : to give something of an idea of what it is , I shall offer an extract about Sulpicius , an account of Mr.
Hardwicke	PERSON	's deal - ings with
Demosthenes	PERSON	, and a few remarks on his chapter on oratory in
America	LOCATION	.

		First , as to
Sulpicius	PERSON	, one of the few cases where our author does not depend chiefly upon long extracts from authorities often unnamed .

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, one of the greatest villains in
Rome	LOCATION	, although that city could boast of a large assortment of villains at this con - juncture .

		Cruel and avaricious , he committed without hesitation the most criminal actions .

		It is said that he sold by public auction the freedom of
Rome	LOCATION	to foreign - ers , telling out the purchase money on counters erected in the Forum for that purpose .

		He kept three thou - sand swordsmen about him in constant pay , ready on any occasion to do his bidding , and these he called his anti-senatorian baud .

		While
Marius	PERSON	was in power , Sul - picius , as tribune , transacted all public affairs by vio - lence and force of arms .

		He decreed to
Marius	PERSON	the command in the Mithradatic war .

		With his band he attacked the consuls while they were holding an assem - bly of the people in the temple of Castor and Pollux , and deposed one of them .

		Sylla , however , having at length gained the ascendency ,
Marius	PERSON	was expelled , and
Sulpicius	PERSON	was put to death in the bloom of his youth and beauty , justly punished for the many crimes which he had committed .

		Notwithstanding his villainy he was endowed with great oratoric powers .

		It is said that he was the most lofty , and what
Cicero	PERSON	called the most tragic , orator of
Rome	LOCATION	; that ' his attitudes , deportment , and figure were of supreme dignity ; his voice was power - ful and sonorous ; his elocution rapid ; his action variable and animated '' -LRB- pp. 34 , 35 -RRB- .

		As to
Demosthenes	LOCATION	, having alluded to the usual anecdotes , our author says : '' Demos - thenes , despising the affected style of the ora - tors of his day , chose Pericles as his model ; hence the chief characteristics of his style were strength and vehemence . ''

		He then gives the historical circumstances under which Demos - thenes ' orations were delivered , adds quotations from the first Philippic and from the oration On the Crown , and follows with quotations from
Goodrich	PERSON	and four unnamed writers , to which he adds the comparison of
Longinus	LOCATION	between Demosthenes and
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		* He then proceeds to his own criticism . ''

		One of the most notice - able excellences of Demosthenes is the colloca - tion of his words '' ; the secret of his success was that he was an honest man and a patriot ; the chief characteristics of his oratory were '' strength , energy , and sublimity , aided by an emphatic and vehement elocution . ''

		This ac - count may appear confused , but it is no more so than Mr.
Hardwicke	PERSON	's .

		Passing rapidly over Oratory in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- noting merely that it takes up almost half the book , that a third of it is devoted to
Erskine	LOCATION	, and that of this about half is taken up with legal matters having no particular connection with oratory -RRB- , we come to Oratory in
America	LOCATION	.

		There is no attempt to deal with the subject , * When , however , Mr.
Hardwicke	PERSON	says that
Longinus	LOCATION	speaks of the eloquence of Demosthenes as '' a clap of thunder that overturns all things , '' he imputes to that inspiring but sane author a piece of folly which he would have put into the fourth chapter of the `` Treatise on the Sublime '' rather than the twelfth .

		beyond a page or two at the beginning : the chapter is made up of disconnected sketches of thirteen American orators .

		Of the character of these sketches some idea may be gathered from the author 's statements -LRB- in different places -RRB- that
John Randolph	PERSON	of Roauoke was '' one of the most remarkable men that ever lived in any age '' ;
Edward Everett	PERSON	, '' one of the most graceful and polished speakers of modern times '' ;
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, '' one of the greatest political and forensic orators that ever lived in any age or country '' ;
Rufus Choate	PERSON	, '' one of the greatest orators and statesmen this country has produced '' ; and

		Such critical epigrams , sandwiched in between anecdotes which are generally inter - esting , extracts from other books on the subject , and passages from orations , make up a piece of work which , however amusing in different ways , can hardly be regarded as a serious work on the subject which it assumes to treat .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 treatise upon economics .

		No thread of connection between the parts can be traced beyond that indi - cated in the sub-title , '' The Relations between
Pri	ORGANIZATION	- vate Property and Public Welfare . ''

		The author aims to occupy the position of an arbiter rather than that of an advocate ; and while he has been unable at times to break away from his strong conservatism , he has maintained his position with moderate suc - cess .

		He is quite right in insisting that a separation between economic theory and economic practice is a mistake , and his combination of the two has produced a work of increased value to the student and of very much greater interest to the general reader .

		Yet his use of history is frequently questionable .

		We are led to doubt whether he really appreciates the fact that conditions are changing , and that the problem of to-day and that of twenty-five years ago must be approached from different standpoints .

		That a proposed remedy proved ineffectual in earlier years is not prima facie evidence that such a remedy is inadequate to meet the present difficulties .

		That the Potter law of
1874	DATE	, for example , failed to meet the need for railroad legislation in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, does not prove that such legislation , in the light of pres - ent needs , is to be condemned without a hearing .

		Such a disposition of the question is apt to lead to the impression that the author has used historical material to force the conclusion he desires to make .

		We are not surprised to find that Professor
Hadley	PERSON	adheres to most of the so-called '' orthodox '' posi - tions in economic theory , after a careful discussion of the attacks that have been made upon these posi - tions .

		He recognizes at the very beginning of his discussion that new problems in modern business life have arisen in connection with large invest - ments of capital in factories and railroads , where free competition becomes an impossibility ; thus necessitating a closer study than formerly of the effect of combinations upon the interests of the con - sumers and of the laborers .

		Socialism must be dealt with as '' a series of practical measures urged by a large and influential body of men who are en - gaged in extending the functions of government . ''

		Yet , though frankly recognizing the limits to the principle , the book is in general an argument in favor of individual freedom .

		While very many will not agree with Professor
Hadley	PERSON	's positions , all must admit that the book is a valuable contribution to the science of economics .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	, in his book on '' Wages and Capital , '' has made a scholarly addition to the lit - erature of economic theory .

		The work is a discus - sion of the vexed question of the relation of capital to wages .

		The author maintains that real wages are paid from the product of past labor , not from that of present labor .

		Present labor chiefly pro- duces unfinished things ; but the reward of present labor is finished things .

		Capital is inchoate wealth , possessions that do not yet serve human wants ; and it includes all goods still in the stage preparatory to final enjoyment .

		Goods remain capital , do not become income , until they emerge from the shop - keeper 's hands .

		Hence the source of real wages exists in the form of capital at the time when the work is done .

		When hired laborers alone are con - sidered , the wage-earners can be said to be depend - ent upon a wages fund .

		Their money income is derived from what the capitalists find it profitable to turn over to them .

		This , however , applies only to the relations of certain kinds of laborers to the modern capitalists .

		It excludes a large class of independent laborers , and hence bears not at all on the permanent and unalterable relation of real cap - ital to real wages .

		The question of the elasticity of the wages fund is considered from two points of view : as to the source of the real wages of all laborers , and as to the source of the money wages which hired laborers receive from employers .

		The sources are roughly predetermined , but so elastic as ' ; o assist not at all in the solution of practical problems .

		The wages-fund doctrine will be found likewise of little assistance in the solution of questions of strikes , trades-unions , combinations , and the like .

		These questions concern themselves with particular wages , not with wages at large .

		Again , the importance of the wages-fund doctrine in the discussions on distri - bution , and especially in the recent discussions upon the residual share , has been exaggerated .

		The doc - trine has rather to do with production than distribu - tion . ''

		Wages may come from capital or from pro- duct , may come from a rigid or an elastic fund of capital ; whatever the answer , it will throw light only on the machinery by which their remuneration is secured , not on the nature and relative strength of the powers which move the machinery . ''

		The remainder of the volume is taken up with a keen analysis and history of the wages-fund doctrine from the time of
Adam Smith	PERSON	down to the present , includ - ing a valuable chapter on contemporary discussion .

		Professor Smart of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, through his trans - lations of the writings of the Austrian school and his independent writings along the same line , has come to be recognized as the leading exponent of those writers among English-speaking peoples .

		His recent book , '' Studies in Economics , '' is but another proof of his right to hold this position .

		There are ten essays in all four studies in wages , three in currency , two in consumption , and a closing discus - sion on the place of industry in the social organism .

		The theory of wages is an attempt to reconcile the old '' cost '' theory and the new `` productivity '' theory .

		Wages are determined by the value of labor , which is a conduction backward from the value of the product of labor .

		But labor has a '' cost '' which is equivalent to the value of its pro- duct in some other line of production , ultimately in agriculture ; and this forms a true irreducible me - dium from which wages may be increased .

		An im - portant conclusion drawn from the discussion is that as wealth in most countries now increases more rap - idly than population , wages tend to rise .

		Not only is the national dividend larger , but the worker gets a larger share of it .

		Hence the weakness of the Malthusian argument .

		The studies in currency will 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, be of especial interest to American readers at this time .

		The chapter entitled `` Must Prices Fall '' presents clearly the fact that a general fall of prices can only take place when currency is scarce .

		Indi - vidual prices fall from improvements in means of production , but tend to rise again as similar improve - ments extend over the field , demand being stim - ulated not only by decrease in price but also by increase in purchasing power .

		The discussions on consumption are perhaps the most interesting of all , for we feel that this much-neglected subject is find - ing through the writings of Professor Smart and the Austrians its proper place in the science of econom - ics .

		The studies in this subject aim to show that the function of consumption in economic life is to maintain and hand on wealth while supporting the worker .

		The mode of consumption is the all - important thing .

		Owners of wealth , by a more un - selfish consumption , could benefit others as well as themselves , and could keep in the world immense sums of wealth that are now thoughtlessly destroyed . ''

		It needs nothing but the will to allow each of us to socialize his consumption and throw open the doors of our house of wealth to humanity . ''

		Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	's '' Outlines of Economic Theory '' follows in general the lines laid down by the Aus - trian writers .

		Man is the centre of the science .

		Demand is the fundamental motive power , and the minimizing of sacrifice the primary law .

		Cost of production is marginal producer 's sacrifice .

		In his discussion of distribution , the author asserts the tendency toward an increasing proportional impor - tance of rent , a probable fall in interest , a fall in the rate of profit as the requisite ability for man - agement becomes more general , and a consequent increase in benefits to the wage-earners as a class and to society as a whole .

		The theory of distribu - tion is similar to that of President
Walker	PERSON	, differ - ing with his presentation only in the extent to which the reduction of profits goes to the increase of wages .

		Interesting applications of the general theory are made to practical economic problems .

		In the dis - cussion of the incidence of taxation , the principle is laid down that no change in the direction of industrial activity will be worked by taxation un - less the amount of the tax be sufficient to more than cancel the margin of difference between em - ployments .

		A tax on commodities , for example , increases the selling price only to the extent that it increases the marginal sacrifice of production .

		Ordinarily , such a tax is paid in part from the pro- ducer 's and in part from the consumer 's rent .

		A tax on profits , again , will be shifted only to the extent that the relative advantages of different em - ployments are over-balanced by the imposition of the tax .

		The book is interesting in its application of the Austrian theory to practical questions , but makes no material contribution to the theory of the subject .

		In his little volume entitled '' Strikes and Social Problems , '' Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	has collected twelve essays and addresses of a popular character , eight of which have before appeared in print .

		The first six treat especially of the conflicts between labor and capital .

		The first three essays , entitled '' Strikes and a Living Wage , '' '' Labor Combinations and Competition , '' and '' Profit Sharing , '' are pleas for a policy of concilation and arbitration , and attempt to show that the policy of combination as often carried out is suicidal . ''

		The Living Capital of the United Kingdom '' and '' Capital and Labor , their relative Strength '' are studies taken from the author 's book on Money and Monetary Problems . ''

		A Plea for Industrial Liberty '' and '' The Reaction in favor of the Classical Political Economy '' present in concise form the individualistic position of the author , a position which manifests itself throughout the vol - ume .

		The essays are of very uneven merit . ''

		A General Freight and Passenger Post , '' by Mr.
James Lewis Cowles	PERSON	, is an attempt to solve the railroad problem by the adoption of the plan now governing our postal system .

		He proposes to throw out of consideration entirely the element of distance , and to charge a uniform rate for all services of a similar character .

		On page vi .

		of the preface , we find : '' The whole business of public transportation should be pooled under the control of the Post - office , and the rate charged for the shortest distance for any particular service -LRB- the cost of service rate -RRB- should be adopted as the uniform standard rate for that class of services for all distances , within the limits of the Postal system . ''

		The author assumes at the start that the cost-of-service theory underlies our postal system , an assumption which is by no means self-evident .

		If this theory is the underlying one , why do not newspapers and packages pay a higher rate than letters ?

		The expense attending the handling of the former is certainly greater .

		As a matter of fact , the charge is made according to what the traffic will bear , a theory which the author many times condemns .

		The true theory underlying our postal system is the social-utility theory ; and had Mr.
Cowles	PERSON	defended his railroad scheme on that ground , he would have merited a hearing if he had not won acquiescence .

		The cost - of-service theory is a wholly false one to employ in the making of railroad rates .

		It is impossible to determine the cost of shipping a single commodity or of transporting a single passenger .

		To ignore distance as an unimportant element in the determin - ation of cost , is unsound .

		What proportion of oper - ating expenses is to be assigned to terminal ex - penses , and what to the expense of the haul , can not be determined until government statisticians have secured a more real control over railroad book - keeping ; but that the hauling expenses are too large an item to be ignored , is certain .

		Again , the author proposes to place all goods in two or three simple classes , abolishing the elaborate system of classifi - cation now in use .

		The result would be that heavy goods which demand a low rate to be moved could not be hauled at all .

		If the rates were made low enough to move these heavy and cheap goods , the receipts from all hauls would not be sufficient to
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 pay operating expenses .

		The only logical theory of rate-making is that which bases rates upon value , those goods which are better able to pay for the haul being charged a rate that will compensate for the lower rates on low-grade goods .

		Government ownership is not made a necessary part of the scheme at the beginning , but the author thinks it should soon follow to make the plan a complete success .

		He fails , however , to tell us the steps by which this is to be carried out .

		He neglects to dis - cuss the financial difficulties in the way of govern - ment purchase , and the political difficulties arising under government ownership .

		He says nothing of the industrial revolution that would follow the inaug - uration of such a policy .

		Yet in spite of the insu - perable difficulties to the working out of the scheme , he says : '' What took three years in the era
1837	DATE	1840 -LSB- referring to the '
Penny Post	ORGANIZATION	' -RSB- ought to be accomplished now in as many months .

		It is surely within the limits of possibility that when the twen - tieth century opens the scheme set forth in this book may be American law , and may be in full operation , within the limits of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Altogether the '' solution '' is too visionary to deserve serious consideration .

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		ii .

		Messrs.
A. C. Armstrong & Son	ORGANIZATION	's superbly ap - pointed edition of M. Gre * ard 's ''
Meissonier	PERSON	, His Life and Art , '' translated by Lady
Mary Loyd	PERSON	and
Miss Florence Simmonds	PERSON	, forms an ideal gift-book of the more sumptuous and impressive order .

		The work is in one royal octavo volume , uniform with Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	's ''
Correggio	LOCATION	'' and
M. Emile Michel	PERSON	's '' Rembrandt '' ; and it makes , we should think , thanks to its subject , a stronger bid for popular favor on this side the water than either of its pre - decessors .

		It contains some two hundred illustra - tions in the text , printed in black and tint , and forty full-page plates , partly in photogravure and partly in color , reproducing all the master 's more famous works .

		The plates are finely done , and they form a series , not only very attractive , but of rare edu - cative value to art students .

		Meissonier was , in point of delicacy and precision of manipulation , probably the most consummate technician since the days of Dow , Metzu , and Mieris ; and the con - noisseur or the student of drawing may profitably linger over the exquisite pen and pencil sketches and studies sprinkled through the text of this noble volume .

		Meissonier 's life lends itself well to the biographer , and
M. Gre	ORGANIZATION	* ard is an admirable one .

		He sets forth the diversified story of the painter 's career in a series of sketches , drawn chiefly from the latter 's own self-revelations in familiar talk and letters , the biography proper occupying about one - half of the volume .

		The remainder consists of extracts from
Meissonier	PERSON	's note-books , together with a series of notes from his conversations , due to the devotion of the lady who eventually became his second wife .

		These pensees , ranging over a variety of themes , literary , artistic , social , political , often reveal a depth and keenness of perception that ef - fectually refutes those inclined to deny intelligence of a high order to the great French genre painter for genre , we take it , was , after all ,
Meissonier	PERSON	's real province .

		True , he inclined in later life toward a more synthetic and dramatic order of composi - tion even toward the imaginative or the '' grand '' style ; but no one , we fancy , who compares his rather commonplace and bombastic efforts in this walk of art -LRB- his semi-allegorical bit of pictorial bathos , entitled ''
Paris	LOCATION	, 1870-1871 , '' a piece re - calling the grotesque flights of
Fuseli	PERSON	and his school -RRB- with such flawless gems of execution and expres - sion as `` La Sixe , '' `` The Sergeant 's Portrait , '' `` The Connoisseurs , '' etc. , and the many spirited single figures and detached groups vignetted in the volume before us , can doubt on which side
Meis	PERSON	- sonier 's genius lay .

		Biographically , the work seems to us complete .

		His career
Meissonier	PERSON	has thus summed up : `` I have known great poverty and great luxury , an obscure beginning and a brilliant end . ''

		As to his glory he exclaims , '' I care little for it !

		It gives me as much delight to stand be - fore a Rembrandt , as to say ' it was I who painted that . '

		If my name were destined to obscurity , and I knew it , I should nevertheless put all my heart and soul into my work ! ''

		But he observes else - where , and with perhaps deeper sincerity : '' No artist would take up the brush , if he knew no liv - ing being would ever see his picture .

		Ask
Emile Augier	PERSON	whether he would write plays if no one read them but himself . ''


Meissonier	PERSON	's last years , if they were shadowed by great griefs , were bright - ened by great joys .

		His works , awaited eagerly by the amateurs of two worlds and bought long ere they had left the easel , had become almost price - less .

		When one of them by a rare chance passed out of the hands of its owner , it was competed for `` in a manner unparalleled in the case of any painter , living or dead . '' ''

		What a history , '' he exclaims -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , `` is that of nay Cuirassiers / It was first bought for two hundred and fifty thousand francs , then sold at
Brussels	LOCATION	for two hundred and seventy-five thousand ; on a certain
Thursday	DATE	the owner was offered a profit of one hundred thou - sand francs on his bargain , and on the
Friday	DATE	it was carried off in triumph .

		Scarcely had the case been opened after the arrival of the picture in
Paris	LOCATION	, when a collector came in , looked at it , and bought it on the spot for four hundred thousand francs , with this graceful speech : <
Tell M. Meissonier	PERSON	that this work , which has been restored to
France	LOCATION	, shall only leave my collection for the
Louvre	LOCATION	. '

		The first owner , who , after enjoying the picture for two years , made a profit of a hundred thousand francs without lifting a finger , is not to be pitied . ''

		Meissonier is often compared with
Terburg	PERSON	and Metzu ; but the most illustrious
Hollander	PERSON	, even Dow or Mieris , has scarcely his miscropic tenuity 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of touch .

		He attained , said
Charles Blanc	PERSON	, '' the highest style of the art of painting grandly in little . ''

		M. Gre * ard 's book , in the opulent setting bestowed upon it by its present publishers , forms the leading art-work of the season ; and we con - gratulate in advance those who shall be fortunate enough to number it among their Holiday gifts .

		A magnificent example of elegantly ornate book - making is ''
France	LOCATION	Under
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, Its Arts , Its Ideas '' -LRB- Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- , translated from the French of
M. Emile Bourgeois	ORGANIZATION	by Mrs.
Cashel Hoey	PERSON	.

		The text is based primar - ily on
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and secondarily on such memoirists as Saint-Simon ,
Dangeau	LOCATION	, Mme. de SeVigne '' , La - bruyere ,
Ormesson	LOCATION	,
Choisy	LOCATION	, Mesdames de Motte - ville ,
Lafayette	LOCATION	,
Spanheim	LOCATION	,
Lavalliere	PERSON	, etc. .

		The pictorial attractions of the work are so unique and diversified as to fairly baffle accurate description .

		The author 's aim seems to have been to make his book a literary and pictorial mirror wherein one may see reflected the men and manners of Le Grand Sikcle .

		When
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	conceived his Essay on the century of
Louis XIV.	LOCATION	, he did not purpose to undertake the general and political study of the reign .

		As a man of letters , rather than a historian , his plan involved a picture , not a narrative , of the preceding epoch .

		To portray the men and manners of that century '' the most enlightened that has ever been '' was his proposal .

		This he failed to do ; but of all his work he seems to have valued most highly the portion now brought before us ; his anecdotes of the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Court ; the picture of ideas , arts , and creeds , of the effect of the gov - ernment on conduct and conditions . ''

		I regarded , '' says
M. Bourgeois	PERSON	, '' the removal of this picture of the
Great Century	ORGANIZATION	from the frame in which it was afterwards placed by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, so as to restore its value and its perspective , as all the more legitimate , because it supplies a certain means of serving , by his aid , the same cause that he served ; the cause of the Frenchmen who made
France	LOCATION	so great two hundred years ago .

		This volume has no other pre - tension , claim , or reason for existence . ''

		To com - plete the picture of the
Great Century	ORGANIZATION	drawn for us by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and the memoirists , the aid of its art has been invoked .

		The art of the seventeenth century , judged usually by the formal decorations of
Versailles	LOCATION	, its ceilings and panels and clipped yew trees , has not been sufficiently interrogated .

		The profusion of beautiful examples of this art reproduced in the volume before us well bear out the opinion of M. Bourgeois that '' Closely exam - ined , it is living , bright , highly finished , full of the grace and charm of the purely French genius which produced it .

		A number of these illustrations are portraits engraved on copper , and these form a superb series .

		Of the illustrations in general it may be said that they are beautifully executed through - out , and on a scale of profusion unequalled in any other publication of the season .

		Of especial inter - est are the numerous cuts after the old engravers and the engravers are , of all artists , the most valu - able to students of the reign of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their art , which reaches its height in
Mellan	LOCATION	,
Morin	LOCATION	,
Nanteuil	PERSON	,
Chauvan	LOCATION	,
Edelinck	LOCATION	, etc. , is not limited to great compositions and portraits , but lends itself to subjects of every kind , scenes of everyday life , architectural views , fashion prints , designs for fur - niture , almanacs , and caricatures ; hence its high illustrative value .

		M. Bourgeois 's work is mag - nificently mounted , as it deserves to be , and pre - sents altogether a regal appearance .

		To scan its beautifully printed pages , with their wealth of thor - oughly effective and pertinent illustrations , is to be transported at once to the glittering -LRB- if not all golden -RRB- days of the Sun King .

		Mr.
Ford M. Hueffer	PERSON	's life of that strong yet all too abstruse and bizarre painter ,
Ford Madox Brown	PERSON	, is not , strictly speaking , a '' Holiday Book '' ; but the lavish pictorial allurements and attractive exterior given it by its publishers -LRB- Longmans -RRB- may perhaps warrant us in treating it as such for the nonce .


Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1821-93 -RRB- was an older member of the Rossetti-Hunt coterie , though not actually a member of the famous ''
P. R. B.	PERSON	'' As he himself expressed it , he was , `` if not an actual Pre-Raphaelite Brother , an aider and abet - tor of Pre-Raphaelitism . ''

		His eccentric yet im - pressive canvases denote a strongly original turn of mind , a facile style , a good technic , a taste by no means flawless , and a riotous fancy .

		They are essentially his own and the fruit of no formula , academic or schismatic , though unmistakably tinged with the spirit of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	and the men of the earliest Italian Renaissance .

		Of the works of
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	it may be said with peculiar truth that they are caviare to the general though the qualification must be added that the attitude to - ward them of '' the general '' is apt to be one not so much of distaste , still less of indifference , as of lingering , puzzled curiosity .

		Of these works the volume before us contains a profusion of examples , most of them full-page autotypes of excellent qual - ity .

		The many reproductions of studies and prep - aratory sketches are of much interest .

		Brown was an interesting personality , and he was a member of an interesting circle made up chiefly of the leading
London	LOCATION	artists and literati of the day ; hence his biographer has had plain sailing , so far as making a readable book is concerned .

		It is easily one of the most entertaining of recent artists ' biographies , and it sheds some valuable side-lights on the mooted characters and aims of the ardent little band of art - reformers whose leaders were
Millais	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, and whose apostle was the eloquent
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		The cover design shows a delicate com - bination , in light tints on a ground of cream white , of conventionalized foliage gracefully blended and interlaced about a panel in light-blue and gold .

		Mr.
Francis T. Underbill	PERSON	's '' Driving for Pleas - ure '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- supplies in a very thorough and satisfactory manner the long-felt want of a book treating directly of the proper appointment of sporting and non-sporting vehicles and '' turnouts ''
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 of every description , from the elaborate four-in - hand coach and park '' drag '' to the '' buckboard . ''

		The author speaks with authority , his qualifications for the task including , we are told , '' not only twenty years of driving , but also a long service as judge at horse shows , which has furnished unlimited oppor - tunities for the study and comparison of equipages . ''

		To this abstruse branch of research , with its vari - ous ramifications , Mr.
Underbill	PERSON	has clearly applied himself with an energy and a nicety of discrimina - tion equal to that which the late Mr.
Macallister	PERSON	used to bring to the investigation of questions of social etiquette and cuisine .

		So far as our rather limited vision in these matters can discern , he has left untouched no considerable question as to what constitutes '' good form '' -LRB- which , be it added , usually corresponds , in his acceptation of the term , to good sense and sound taste -RRB- in equipage and its appointments and belongings in harness , liveries , horse-clothing , stables , stable-furnishings , and so on .

		In fine , actual or prospective owners of horse vehi - cles of any and every description and degree of elaborateness or of simplicity , who wish their equip - ages to be appointed tastefully , correctly , and in accordance with the dictates of expert experience , may find in Mr.
Underbill	PERSON	's book a most valuable guide and vade-mecum on the subject .

		The vol - ume is very handsomely made up and profusely illustrated with photographic plates .

		The binding is a very suitable and tasteful combination -LRB- mod - estly '' horsey '' in its suggestions -RRB- of brown levant and undressed leather , with gilt side-stamp repre - senting carriage-whip , etc. .

		For a friend of eques - trian tastes the book would form a specially elegant and acceptable gift .

		Mr.
John Dennie	PERSON	's admirable work on '' Rome of To-day and
Yesterday	DATE	, '' the very best book of the kind ever written , is now issued by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	in a handsome third edition , furnished with five maps and plans , and fifty-eight illustrations from Roman photographs .

		Mr.
Dennie	PERSON	has long been a resident of
Rome	LOCATION	and a careful student of her antiquities .

		Conscious of the difficulties in the way of acquiring knowledge in this special branch of research that beset him in his own early Roman days , he has pre - pared a book specially designed to smooth for others the arduous path he himself has travelled .

		He has thus brought together in a volume of moderate dimensions the results of his own wide reading , and of his prolonged and leisurely examination of the ruins of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		To the wealth of historical lore and
august	DATE	memories locked from the unini - tiated in these fragmentary yet still colossal relics of a storied past , his book forms a most convenient key .

		Rome is , as Mr.
Dennie	PERSON	says , '' par excellence the great historic city '' ; and in her ruins lies written in decipherable characters the history of her eleven Pagan centuries . ''

		To explain , in some measure , what the Roman ruins mean , when and why these buildings were erected , enough about each building and each builder to link the whole eleven centuries into one continuous story , '' is the ostensible object of Mr.
Dennie	PERSON	's book .

		Its style is at once animated and scholarly ; and while it is primarily intended for the more intelligent class of general readers , even specialists must be impressed with the wealth of information condensed within its 355 pages .

		Rome of to-day is comprehensively treated in the opening chapter , the remainder of the work being devoted to
Rome	LOCATION	of yesterday .


Signer Anderson	PERSON	, from whose photographs most of the illustrations are printed , has displayed rare taste and judgment in placing his camera few of the views being open to the charge of triteness , while none of the main objects of historical and archaeological interest are slighted .

		The book is neatly and solidly bound in grass-green linen , with back and quarter sides of white buckram .

		Print , paper , and general finish are unexceptionable .

		An excellent idea is embodied in the J. B. Lip - pincott
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's set of four .

		trim volumes entitled `` Half-hours of Travel at Home and Abroad , '' compiled by Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, and it has been well carried out .

		The work consists of selected travel-pictures , geographically classified , drawn from the writings of a great many travellers representing many countries , the aim being to tell the story of the world , alike of its familiar and its unfamiliar portions , as displayed in the narratives of those who have seen its every part , and .

		particularly of those who were early visitors to previously unknown lands , and whose descriptions are therefore those of discoverers .

		The volumes thus afford a sort of comprehensive bird 's - eye view of the globe as seen through the eyes of rarely competent observers ; and they should prove a real boon to those fond of the literature of travel and adventure , yet lacking the means or the opportunity to read in extenso the many excellent works which that literature now contains .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	has made his selections with much taste and judgment , showing a due regard both for literary quality and for the educative side of the general plan of the work .

		The first volume is devoted to ''
America	LOCATION	, '' the second to ''
Europe	LOCATION	, '' the third to ''
Asia	LOCATION	, '' and the fourth to ''
Africa	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	. ''

		In the first there are fifty-two selec - tions ; in the second , fifty-two ; in the third , forty - seven ; in the fourth , forty-six .

		Each volume con - tains six half-tone plates .

		The authors represented are , like the '' other attractions '' of the average theatrical poster , '' too numerous to mention '' ; but they are all worthy of the place accorded them .

		The volumes are very well made , their low price considered ; and they form an altogether capital Holiday gift of the more useful and solid sort .

		In his '' Naval Actions of the War of 1812 '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	tells in a very direct and spirited fashion the story of those famous ac - tions and sea - duels that are , or should be , to an American heart what
Trafalgar	PERSON	and the tale of the Armada are to an English one .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	's narrative is well adapted to stir in the reader a glow of generous patriotism and a proper sense of national esprit de corps , without at the same time THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, fostering a spirit of animosity toward our erstwhile foe .

		One may surely glory in the deeds of a De - catur , a
Bainbridge	LOCATION	, or a
Perry	PERSON	, and still be many degrees removed from the Jingo or the Anglophobe .

		The nineteen papers in the volume tell the story of thrice that number of sea-fights , from the general actions of fleets , down to the detached exploits of single cruisers and privateers .

		They have been compiled from official records , and from files and volumes of private correspondence ; and are hence of considerable historic and biographic value .

		The book is attractively made , the chief pictorial feat - ure being Mr.
C. T. Chapman	PERSON	's twenty-one illus - trations in color , which may be considered approxi - mately faithful studies of the scenes they represent .

		There are also a number of cuts of medals awarded by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to victorious naval commanders . ''

		A Book of Country Clouds and Sunshine '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the somewhat indefinite title of a series of papers on
New England	LOCATION	town and coun - try life , by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, who also furnishes the illustrations .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is very much at home with his theme , and plainly writes con amore .

		His descriptions are fresh and natural , and have the right `` down East '' -LRB- or `` daown East '' -RRB- tone , as have his pictures .

		Among the latter may be noted such homely yet apposite scenes as '' Sawing Ice , '' '' Washing up for Dinner , '' '' Working over Butter , '' '' Washing Day , '' '' Paring Apples , '' '' Filling the Silo , '' '' Husking Corn , '' Topping Onions , '' and the like ; while other more poetic , if not more charac - teristic , ones represent choice bits of
New England	LOCATION	landscape .

		The book is , first and foremost , about the farmer and his ways , and about village life and character ; and its main drift may be gathered from such titles as '' A
Winter	DATE	Ride , '' '' Town Meeting , '' '' A Hill-Town Sabbath , '' '' A Christian Endeavor Meeting , '' `` The Farm Day by Day , '' etc. .

		The author is -LRB- theoretically at all events -RRB- quite in love with the phase of life he depicts .

		A pleasant
New England	LOCATION	village -LRB- '' not too far removed from a large town and the railroad '' -RRB- is , he holds , `` the best dwelling-place in the world . ''

		Perhaps so ; but we think Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's qualification an essential one .

		Many persons look back on some remote New En - gland farm or village with sentimental fond regret ; but they do n't go back -LRB- at least not to stay -RRB- not even when their '' pile is made , '' and their hand is free , and their final abiding-place is a matter of choice .

		No : they love to dream of the old days of youth , and health , and sweet content , and simple bucolic toils and joys , and to prose about them re - gretfully for the edification of politely skeptical friends and family .

		But they stick to the city ; and are laid away at last not in the far-away rustic graveyard where the rude forefathers of their na - tive hamlet sleep but in a spacious marble - streeted necropolis not too remote from the bustling scene of their earthly activities .

		Three of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's papers are reprinted from '' The Out - look , '' '' The Congregationalist , '' and '' The
Cosmo	ORGANIZATION	- politan '' respectively ; but the remaining eleven , we take it , now appear for the first time .

		The book is both comely and readable .

		Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's pleasant travel-book , '' Gray Days and Gold , '' is likely to enjoy a renewed lease of popularity in the new illustrated edition of it issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text has been carefully revised by the author , who has corrected certain errors of date and statement that crept into the original edition .

		The chapters on
Clopton	PERSON	and Devizes have been considerably expanded , the record of Shakespearian affairs at
Stratford	LOCATION	has been augmented , and an effort has been made to render the style more flexible and concise .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's book presents the best American account since Irving of rural
England	LOCATION	; and it well merits the pains he has bestowed upon it , as well as the more opulent setting in which it now appears .

		There are one hundred illustrations , full-page and text , in woodcut and process .

		The subjects selected are germane to the text , consisting of literary shrines and portraits , rural and urban views of historic or literary interest , etc. .

		The volume is full-gilt , and chastely bound in bluish gray , with a thistle design in gilt tracery over all .

		The work now forms the choicest of guides and the most inspiring of com - panions to American travellers inclined to view a trip to
England	LOCATION	, not as a mere holiday jaunt to the world 's great pleasure - mart and common Vanity Fair , but as in some sort a religious pilgrimage to a fatherland graced with a thousand historic shrines and
august	DATE	ancestral memories .


Sheridan	PERSON	's `` School for Scandal '' and `` The Rivals '' are issued together in one of the tasteful green-and-gold ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' volumes -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , so deservedly popular with seekers of choice yet moderate-priced Holiday books .

		The artist this time is Mr.
Edmund J. Sullivan	PERSON	, who furnishes a number of drawings of fair average quality .

		Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	writes a rather lengthy introduc - tion on
Sheridan	PERSON	, taking for his starting point Mr.
Fraser Rae	PERSON	's recent Life of that much canvassed and -LRB- we are inclined to think -RRB- much fibbed-about genius .

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, while admitting the merits of Mr.
Rae	PERSON	's book on the whole , inclines to take issue with him , in that he , having persuaded him - self that the traditional
Sheridan	PERSON	is a false Sher - idan , sets himself at work to construct an entirely new one .

		We do not ourselves think Mr.
Rae	PERSON	has gone this far ; but we quite agree with Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	-LRB- as we have no doubt that Mr.
Rae	PERSON	would do -RRB- , when he says : '' For my part , were I ever to be the biographer of a famous man long dead , I would never quarrel outright with a tradition .

		Temper it with charity , modify it with time , make ample allowances for jealousies and contending vanities , still ampler for sheer inventiveness ; but this done , the stream of tradition , thus purified , which has trickled down to you , however far removed it may be from the truth , is far more likely to be nearer that shy commodity than anything you are in the least likely to concoct for yourself . ''

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	has not , we believe , departed so widely from this sound
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 principle as Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	seems to imply .


Sheridan	PERSON	's two delightful comedies may be read with new de - light in this neat and convenient volume .

		The recent death of
George Du Maurier	ORGANIZATION	gives peculiar acceptability to a volume of his drawings just published -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		The work is an oblong quarto , and is entitled '' English Society . ''

		The drawings are reprinted from '' Harper 's Magazine , '' in which they have appeared during the past ten years .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	contributes a charming intro - duction , in which he discourses upon Du Maurier 's fiction , taking it as the supreme example of the '' kind capable of expressing an engaging beauty , and bewitchingly portraying many phases of life , which comes smiling to you or -LRB- in vulgar keeping -RRB- nudging you , and asking you to a game of make - believe . ''

		Of this sort of fiction , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	de - clares : '' This novelist , who wrote no fiction till nigh sixty , is the greatest master who ever lived , and I do not forget either
Sterne	PERSON	or
Thackeray	PERSON	when I say so . ''

		Of course we must make much allowance for the very uncritical exuberance that marks the pronouncements of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	when - ever his feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of any book or writer , but this sketch , or essay , re - mains a very pleasant thing , and fitly prefaces a collection of the drawings that so gently satirize the foibles of modern fashionable life .

		The book is one of the most attractive of the year .

		Good taste and good workmanship are not lack - ing in the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Book of Old English Ballads , '' illustrated with decorative drawings in the Pre-Raphaelitist manner by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	, and furnished with an Introduction by Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	, who is , we presume , re - sponsible for the selections .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	's draw - ings , while they are of rather uneven merit , rank well as a whole -LRB- thanks to such fine plates as those facing pages 32 , 56 , 124 , and 177 -RRB- , and harmonize duly with the spirit of the text .

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's Intro - duction is a rather lengthy and nicely discrimina - tive dissertation on the nature and origin of the ballad in general .

		The selections are made with taste , and embrace such sterling old favorites as `` Chevy Chace , '' `` Annan Water , '' ``
Barbara Allen	PERSON	, '' '' Fair
Margaret	PERSON	and Sweet
William	PERSON	, '' '' Young Waters , '' '' The Twa Corbies , '' The Nut - brown Maid , '' '' The Banks o ' Yarrow , '' '' Sir Pat - rick
Spens	PERSON	, '' the indispensable Robin Hood trio , etc. .

		There are twenty-six titles altogether all of them choice names that carry a perfume in the mention .

		From cover to cover the little book presents an agreeably harmonious whole .

		Every year , at the approach of the holiday sea - son , the lover of beautiful books eagerly awaits -LRB- his appetite having meanwhile been whetted by certain seductive announcements -RRB- the collection of small volumes that make up Mr.
T. B. Mosher	PERSON	's modest but exquisite output .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's books for the present season are , if possible , more attractive than ever .

		They are eight in number , and fall into three categories .

		First of all we have two booklets in the '' Brocade '' series , printed on Japanese vellum in the style of Pater 's '' The Child in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' pub - lished last year .

		These two numbers give us '' The Pageant of
Summer	DATE	, '' by
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, and '' The Story of Amis and Amile , '' translated from the mediaeval French by
William Morris	PERSON	, and orig - inally printed at the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The three '' Brocade '' booklets may be had together in one of the prettiest imaginable boxes , and will make an ideal gift from one person of taste to another .

		Sim - ilar terms must be used to characterize the numbers of the '' Old World '' series , four of which are added this year to the '' Omar '' and the '' Aucassin '' of last .

		They are
Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Sylvie	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France	LOCATION	, ''
Richard Burton	PERSON	's '' The Kasidah of
Haji Abdu El-Yezdi	PERSON	, '' and
Dante	PERSON	's ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	'' in
Rossetti	PERSON	's translation .

		The Burton book calls for a word of explanation .

		It is an original poem pretending to be a transla - tion .

		Its special significance is found in the strik - ing resemblance it bears to the famous '' RubalyaV ' although the latter -LRB- in
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's version -RRB- were not printed until several years after
Burton	PERSON	had written the string of philosophical couplets wherein he questions the universe in a way hardly less au - dacious than that of the Tent-maker .

		As for the ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, '' we can only echo the editor 's sur - prise that it has never before been printed in sepa - rate form .

		We , at least , have often prayed that it might be , and are happy to note that its present dress is not unworthy what we are often tempted to call the most beautiful book in the world .

		Purchasers of these '' Old World '' reprints may get as pretty a box to go with them as the one above mentioned , if they order three , four , or all six of the volumes .

		Finally , there are two additions to the '' Bibelot '' series Mr.
J. H. McCarthy	PERSON	's prose translation of Omar , and '' The Defence of Guenevere , '' the latter being a volume of lyrics selected from the works of
William Morris	PERSON	, and likely , in view of the recent death of the poet , to find more favor from book - buyers than any other book in Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's list .

		Redolent of the brine and breezily written , as befits the productions of a right son of
Neptune	LOCATION	, are the eight articles , by
Lieut.-Commander Kelley	PERSON	,
U.S.N.	LOCATION	, descriptive of sea-life aboard the
Atlantic	LOCATION	liner , the yacht , and the man-of-war , reprinted in the comely volume entitled '' The Ship 's Company , and Other Sea People '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		The author knows whereof he writes , and is master of a good , descriptive style .

		The titles are : '' The Ship 's Company , '' '' The Squadron Cruise , '' '' Midshipmen , Old and New , '' '' Superstitions of the Sailor , '' `` The Basket of the Sea , '' '' The Rigor of the Game , '' '' The Spirit of Libogen , '' '' Queer Pets of Sailor
Jack	PERSON	. ''

		The volume is tastily bound , and contains a liberal number of full-page plates of the good quality one has long learned to look for in the Messrs.
Harpers	PERSON	' best publications .

		Of handy pocket editions of Shakespeare there is now no lack , and the best of them are so good as to render choice between them mainly a matter of THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, individual taste .

		An excellent specimen of the class is the set of a dozen 16mo volumes , hand - somely boxed , published in
London	LOCATION	by
George Newnes , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	, and in this country by the J. B. Lip - pincott Co. .

		The set bears the unmistakable marks of sound British taste and workmanship ; and should by all means be considered by those intending to include the works of the great dramatist among their Holiday purchases .

		Of the merits of the captivat - ing little volumes in the '' Temple Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we have already frequently spoken .

		What more delightful Christmas gift could be im - agined than this elegant , dainty , and withal thor - oughly practical and useful series ?

		For general reading and for class-room use there is perhaps no better edition than the `` Temple . ''

		The beautiful edition of
Captain Marryatt	ORGANIZATION	's novels , published in
England	LOCATION	by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and in
America	LOCATION	by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is now complete .

		The editing , by Mr.
R. Brimley Johnson	PERSON	, and the etchings by various hands that adorn each volume , are all that one could wish ; while the mechanical dress of the books , with their rough edges , dark buckram covers , and tasteful ex libris design , is such as to create a desire to revel anew in these stories that so charmed our boyhood .

		There are twenty-two volumes altogether , the fol - lowing being the concluding issues : ''
Valerie	PERSON	, '' `` Settlers in
Canada	LOCATION	, '' `` The Little Savage , '' `` The Mission , '' and '' Children of the New Forest . ''

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons issue , in a pretty volume entitled '' In
Ole Virginia	LOCATION	, '' a sheaf of stories by Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page .

		The stories are all old favorites '' Meh Lady , '' '' Unc '
Edin	PERSON	- burg , '' ``
Marse Chan	PERSON	, '' `` Polly , '' etc. , and many will be glad to find them thus obtainable in a single volume , and embellished with the original drawings by Messrs.
Smedley	PERSON	,
Clinedinst	PERSON	,
Reinhart	PERSON	,
Frost	ORGANIZATION	,
Pyle	PERSON	, and
A. Castaigne	PERSON	.

		The volume is daintily bound , and forms one of the prettiest of the mod - erate-priced gift-books .

		Mr.
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	's romantic poem , `` Friar
Jerome	PERSON	's Beautiful Book , '' is issued by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Miiftin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a tastefully made booklet printed in missal style and appropri - ately decorated by Mr.
W. S. Hadaway	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Had	PERSON	- away 's border designs , initial letters , and frontis - piece drawing are well conceived , and accord well with the drift and sentiment of the text .

		There is a tied cover of brown leatherette , appropriately completing an ensemble that is modest , harmonious , and pleasing .

		Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's '' George Washing - ton '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is brought within the category of holiday books by virtue of the handsome garb given it by the publishers , and the large number of illus - trations prepared for it by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, Mr.
Harry Fenn	PERSON	, and other artists .

		The text is liter - ature in a high sense rather than book-making , as the name of the author sufficiently guarantees .

		We hope to deal with this book in detail at a later date , and must now be content with a word of praise for its finished literary workmanship , its accurate schol - arship , and its high patriotic ideal .

		We doubt if the career of
Washington	LOCATION	has ever received worth - ier treatment at the hands of biographer , historian , or political philosopher .

		The volume extends to over three hundred pages , and has a good index .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's showy edition of Bulwer 's '' Richelieu , '' lavishly illustrated with full - page and text drawings by Mr.
F. C. Gordon	PERSON	, forms a rather attractive gift-book of the more pronounced '' Christmas-book '' type .

		The text is openly printed on glazed paper , full gilt , and the cover shows an elaborate design in light-blue and gold .

		Mr.
Gor	PERSON	- don 's designs are generally passable ; but some of the woodcuts are marred by their '' scratchy '' effect .

		Very dainty and enticing in their chaste bindings of white buckram with gilt lettering and tracery are Miss
Anna Fuller	PERSON	's little companion volumes , '' A Literary Courtship '' and '' A Venetian June '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- .

		Each of the stories is locally illustrated with half-tone plates , the former one containing views of
Colorado	LOCATION	scenery , the latter of
Venice	LOCATION	.

		The books are among the prettiest in their class , and will not fail of finding friends and admirers .

		Miss
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	's '' Legends of the Virgin and Christ '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pretty and desirable little book , the aim of which is to present in compact and pleasing form those sacred legends which form the motifs of such countless works of Christian literature and art .

		Its object is , not to furnish a long list of noted religious pictures , but rather to narrate succintly the legends they embody .

		Then , as the author observes , it will be easy for the reader , with a distinct idea in his mind of the Scriptural and legendary lore concerning Christ and the Virgin , to trace out the story as told in art , and to gain a clearer insight into the artists ' motives .

		The usefulness of the book will be at once apparent to the Protestant reader especially .

		The stories are simply and directly told , and they are accom - panied by twenty-four half-tone reproductions of famous paintings , ancient and modern .

		Mr.
Phil May	PERSON	's volume called '' Gutter-Snipes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comprises a series of fifty pen-and-ink drawings representing the characteristic antics and comicalities of that most irrepressible of all gamins , the
London	LOCATION	'' Street Arab . ''

		The pictures are very funny , and have an occasional flavor of the pencil of genial
John Leech	PERSON	.

		Anyone who has lounged observantly in the
London	LOCATION	parks , or about the Malthus-defying districts at the
East End	LOCATION	, can vouch for the accuracy of Mr.
May	DATE	's delineations .

		Some of the drawings are vigorous and telling bits of work , technically .

		Mr.
Benjamin F. Taylor	PERSON	's '' Songs of Yesterday '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a collection of poems on various themes , which , as the author quaintly observes , are like Lot 's wife in that '' they all look over their shoulders . ''

		Many of them treat of farm life , and all are likely to please the popular taste .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's numbers are occasionally a little harsh , and his diction a little prosaic ; but he is usually
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 moved by and in sympathy with his theme which means a good deal .

		The volume is acceptably made up , and contains a liberal number of woodcuts .

		We have nothing but commendation for
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's very tasteful two-volume edition of the '' Constantinople '' of
Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	, translated by
Maria H. Lansdale	PERSON	.

		De
Ami	PERSON	- cis 's charming work has never before , we think , had so charming a setting .

		The volumes contain fifty well-selected and beautifully-made photogravure plates , embracing such subjects as '' View of
Pera	PERSON	and Galata , '' '' View of Stambul , '' '' Interior of Mosque of Ahmed , '' '' Entrance to
St. Sophia	LOCATION	, '' Palace of the Sultan , '' '' Types of Turkish Sol - diers , '' '' A Turkish Lady , '' '' Girl of the Harem , '' '' Coffee-Makers , '' '' Dancing Girls , '' etc. .

		There are also a good folding map and an index .

		The notably dainty and artistic binding , deep blue with delicate arabesque tracery in gilt , calls for a word of praise . ''

		Through Love to Light '' -LRB-
Joseph Knight Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a rather pleasing anthology of verse compiled by Mr.
John White Chadwick	PERSON	and Mrs.
Annie Hath	PERSON	- away
Chadwick	PERSON	.

		The principle of selection is indi - cated in the sub-title , ' * Songs of Good Courage , '' which certainly leaves the editors sufficient leeway , allowing them to run the gamut of poets from Shake - speare and
Wordsworth	PERSON	to '' Ironquill '' and Mr.
Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	has thriftily in - cluded a number of little things of his own .

		The volume has a fanciful and seasonable binding .

		An attractive edition of
Charles Yriarte	PERSON	's '' Ven - ice '' is issued by
Messrs. H. T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a small octavo , with a notably pretty binding , and contains fifty full-page photogravures of excellent quality and judicious selection .


M. Yriarte	PERSON	's work is at once one of the most delightful and most sol - idly instructive books of anything like its scope yet written on
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		The Pursuit of Happiness Calendar '' -LRB-
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- is a rather elab - orate affair , containing , in addition to the almanac proper , selected aphoristic sentences -LRB- one for each day in the year -RRB- from the writings of Dr.
Daniel G. Brinton	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Martha Allston Potts	PERSON	is respon - sible for the selections , and Mr.
William Sherman Potts	PERSON	for the decorations the latter consisting mainly of borders and backgrounds of convention - alized leaves and flowers printed in black-and-white .

		The cover is of soft brown paper tied with red silk at the back , and ornately stamped with fanciful tracery in black .

		The decorations are pleasing and not overdone , and we have no doubt that Mrs.
Potts	PERSON	has done justice to her author whose portrait gazes through an oval aperature in the left-hand cover .

		A convenient and tasteful calendar is '' The Weather Vane , '' issued by The Channing Auxiliary of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		It is clearly printed in black - letter , with not too profuse decorations in black and red , and contains '' the days of the year , times of the rising and setting of the sun , phases of the moon as well as its altitude and time of reaching meridian , eclipses , morning and evening stars , '' etc. .


Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omical matters are agreeably interspersed with lit - erary ; and the publication is on the whole a good one , and useful to have at hand .

		Many other books have come to us in holiday dress , and deserve more extended consideration than it is possible for us to give them .

		Brief men - tion of a few of these books must bring this long review to an end .

		Messrs.
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	pub - lish in their series of '' English Love Sonnets '' an edition of the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' printed on handmade paper , and provided by Mr.
Bertram Goodhue	PERSON	with initial letters and other orna - mental designs .

		A poetical anthology for lovers , edited in two volumes by
Mr G. H. Ellwanger	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, bears the title of '' Love 's Demesne . ''

		There is a grace - ful introductory essay , followed by a great variety of love-poems grouped under their respective au - thors , English and American .

		The arrangement is alphabetical by authors , and the collection dis - plays discernment and good taste .

		The holiday edition of '' The Poems of
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , with a good portrait , brings within a single set of covers the contents of the two volumes pub - lished during Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	's lifetime , together with a selection from his '' Ballads of the Town '' -LRB- pub - lished in '' Puck '' -RRB- , and a few later lyrics and oc - casional poems .

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	provides the brief introduction .

		The '' Globe '' .

		poets pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are well known and deservedly popular ; the latest addition to the series is '' The Poetical Works of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		The publishers have not ventured upon a single - volume edition ; but have given us all the poems in two volumes , each illustrated by a portrait .

		As between this edition and the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	''
Brown	PERSON	- ing of
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Miiflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	there is little to choose .

		If anything , the advantage is with the latter , which is in a single volume , is a little lower in price , and includes the prose essay on Shelley .

		But the two-volume edition must be a boon to the English public , which has heretofore been unable to possess all the poems of
Browning	PERSON	without purchasing a shelf-full of volumes .

		The editing of these volumes is done by Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	also appears as editor of a six-volume
Boswell	PERSON	, published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work is discreetly and unobtrusively done , and prettier volumes in appearance are rarely seen .

		This edi - tion does not rival Mr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	's monumental work , but rather supplements it , and we can imagine an ardent Boswellian , with the Hill edition already upon his shelves , purchasing the present edition for its companionable qualities , to be carried about in the pocket , a volume at a time .

		Mention of Mr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	reminds us that his `` Talks about Autographs '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must not go unnoticed .

		The text of this volume has been appearing of late in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' but the illustrations are new , and add greatly to the interest of this very charming series of discursive papers upon men and 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, letters .

		A meritorious art-book is '' The Master - pieces of Michelangelo '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which presents seventeen half-tone plates from sculp - tures and frescoes , with the addition of a reproduc - tion of the famous '' Satan '' of the eccentric
Brus	PERSON	- sels painter
Anton Wiertz	PERSON	, after the descriptions of
Milton	LOCATION	, whose genius the writer of the interesting text , Mr.
A. H. Twombly	PERSON	, thinks akin to that of the great master in art whose character and career he sketches in a scholarly and sympathetic way .

		An - other art-book is '' The Story of the Masterpieces '' -LRB-
Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of photogravures of eight of the most famous paintings of as many masters , with descriptive text by Mr.
Charles M. Stuart	PERSON	.

		Miss
Manning	PERSON	's '' Cherry and Violet '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- appears in an illustrated edition with an introduction by the Rev.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	.

		A new edition of Mr.
Volney Streamer	PERSON	's collection of sen - timents about friendship , '' In Friendship 's Name , '' which has been a favorite gift-book for a number of years , is issued in attractive style by Messrs.
Lamson	PERSON	,
Wolff e , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A little volume on the same theme , '' Concerning Friendship , '' by Miss
Eliza A. Stone	PERSON	, is issued in the form of a year-book ; and with it as a companion volume ,
Miss Rose Porter	PERSON	's collection of sayings `` About Children , '' both published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Our last item shall be '' Little Journeys to the Homes of American Au - thors '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by various authors , a companion to Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's volume upon English au - thors published a year ago .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		The efforts of Miss
Eliza Orne White	PERSON	, author of '' A Little Girl of Long Ago '' -LRB- Houghtou -RRB- , to picture the old-fashioned games and gowns and books of the generation preceding the Civil War , enables us to establish a sort of landmark from which to measure the growth of that new child-literature that has had such marked development in recent years .

		We all know that while the boy of the period which
Miss White	ORGANIZATION	describes was allowed to revel at will in
Scott	LOCATION	and
Byron	PERSON	-LRB- even covertly reading '' Tom Jones '' or '' Tristram Shandy '' in remote places -RRB- , the only books considered safe for a girl to read were such as '' The Wide , Wide World , '' '' The Children of the Abbey , '' and
Hannah More	PERSON	's tedious stories ; even the works of
Jane Austen	PERSON	and
Miss Ferris	ORGANIZATION	being excluded from many religious families , simply because they were novels .

		In our day it would be difficult to find the novel which the modern girl has not read .

		If there is a boundary - line between the boy 's book and the girl 's book of to - day , it is an imaginary one , very indefinitely located .

		The modern boy is no longer ashamed to read a book written for girls , and the girl is seldom better pleased than when she ventures into the boy 's literary domain .

		Both sides have profited by this : the boy 's book has gained in purity of tone , and the girl 's book has ceased to be chiefly milk for babes .

		Any boy fond of reading can hardly fail to be interested , for example , in Mrs.
Everett-Green	PERSON	's `` Olive Roscoe '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , a bright and breezy story of life in the coal districts of
North	LOCATION	- ern
England	LOCATION	during a strike .

		Some scenes are laid in
Devonshire	LOCATION	, thus giving the author opportunity to con - trast the scenery and types of the two regions .

		The strange hallucinations of the heroine 's mother form the materials for a clever underplot , and add much to the interest of this striking and original story , which boys will like none the less because its leading character is so characteristically feminine .

		Any healthy-minded girl , on the other hand , whose brother owns a copy of Mr.
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	's '' The Black Tor '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , will be pretty sure to find interest in this his - torical tale descriptive of the reign of James I .

		It is full of action and adventure , picturing a very lively feud between two rival families , each one claiming the ownership of the Black Tor Lead Mine .

		The manner in which the feud is settled by the two boys who are the leading claimants , and who generously rescue one another at different times from imminent peril , is related in a manner which must prove entertaining to young readers of both sexes .

		The principal actors in Mr.
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	's at - tractive story '' Beneath the Sea '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- are two adventurous boys and a no less adventurous Scotch collie .

		The three , sometimes accompanied by an old miner , make various explorations in an ancient tin mine in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, which had not been worked for centuries ; they become imprisoned there , with the water from the sea rising about them ; and after a fearful struggle they are saved by Grip , the Scotch collie , who escapes through a hole too small for a boy , and brings relief to the unfortunates .

		The book is well illustrated , and the cover is decorated with a colored picture of the
Cornish Coast Another	ORGANIZATION	story by the same author relates to court-life in the time of George the First , entitled '' In Honor 's Cause '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The conven - tional lines of historical stories for boys are very suc - cessfully followed .

		Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	's '' Through Swamp and Glade '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is an indirect but telling plea for the little band of five hundred Indians who still inhabit the ever - glades of
Florida	LOCATION	.

		It is an admirable story of the Seminole War , treating with historical fidelity the characters of the famous Indian chiefs
Osceola	LOCATION	and
Coacoochee	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , by Mr.
Victor Perard	PERSON	, represent the characteristic scenery of
Florida	LOCATION	, and the cover is ornamented by a colored picture of a Seminole chief in full costume .

		Another and a very different book by Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	is ''
Rick Dale	PERSON	'' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , a stir - ring tale of the adventures of a runaway boy , a mil - lionaire 's son , who finds varied fortunes and experiences on the
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		The gradual development of the boy 's character as he learns to take care of himself is told in Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	's characteristic manner .

		The book is handsomely illustrated by Mr.
W. A. Rogers	PERSON	.

		A book to keep a boy at home of an evening is Pro- fessor
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	's '' Around the Camp Fire '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a collection of thrilling hunter 's stories told by the various members of a fishing excursion .

		One of them tells bear stories ; another tells logging yarns ; while a third declares that panthers have been hunting him , or he them , ever since he was a babe in arms , and that although he has always conquered his panther , his one superstition is that some day he will meet his match and will ultimately be killed by one of these clever beasts for the panther is described as the shrewdest of ani - mals , quite over-reaching the sly Reynard and '' Brer Rabbit . ''

		The illustrations , by Mr.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	, are in harmony with the somewhat exaggerated tone of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 the stories , for who expects an old hunter to stick too closely to the facts ?

		A touch of humor lends life to '' The American Boy 's Book of Sport '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and one is predisposed in favor of its author , Mr.
D. C. Beard	PERSON	, not only by the popularity of his '' Boy 's Handy Book , '' but by the fact that he at once takes his stand for the ''
Tom Sawyers	PERSON	'' and '' Huckleberry Finns '' as against the '' Fauntleroys '' of boyhood .

		In it the right sort of appeal is made to boys .

		Carefully illustrated directions are given , both as to methods of playing the many games described , and of making the implements required for them ; and while planned somewhat after the earlier publication , the present book is thoroughly up to date in all details of kite-flying , bicycling , golf , and other sports .

		Because of limited space , base-ball , tennis , and cricket are omitted .

		It is encouraging to find so many good historical books for the young this year .

		The historical truth in '' Midshipman Farragut '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is not only stran - ger than ordinary fiction , but it is far more interesting .

		Marvellous as the spi ?

		it and ability of the young mid - shipman seem , the author of this book , Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	, assures us in his preface that this child was indeed father of the man .

		This is the sort of book a boy needs in order to fill his mind with heroic deeds and his heart with patriotism , and by no means least in importance to accustom him to a good , clear lit - erary style .

		The interest of the illustrations centres in two sketches by Captain
Porter	PERSON	.

		Many characteristic events in the life of Ivan the Cruel , the first Tsar of
Russia	LOCATION	, are interwoven in Mr.
Fred	PERSON	.

		Whishaw 's romance , '' A
Boyar	PERSON	of the Terrible '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The hero ,
Sasha Stroganof	PERSON	, is repre - sented as one of
Ivan	PERSON	's favorite
Boyars	PERSON	and yet his foot is pinned to the ground by
Ivan	PERSON	's terrible iron staff in one of that monarch 's fits of anger .

		While the outrageous cruelty of the Tsar is plainly set forth , the author has skilfully given his boyish readers a fair idea of the terrible majesty and personal fascination of this erratic monarch .

		The types and scenery used for the illustrations in this work are distinctively Rus - sian , and are a credit to the artist , Mr.
H. G. Massey	PERSON	.

		No child who enjoys the familiar things of nature will be disappointed in Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	's ''
Tommy	PERSON	- Anne and the Three Hearts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In this delightful book the child soon learns the lan - guage of animals and all growing things , and listens to the talks of the bobolink , the creeping grass , the tad - poles and the rabbits , who tell him with the most charming unreserve the story of their homes and lives .

		The work is probably the most charming nature-book for children published this year .

		The illustrations , by Mr.
Albert D. Blashfield	PERSON	, are as suggestive and original as the text .

		Miss
Henrietta C. Wright	PERSON	continues her good services to young people by presenting a second volume of '' Children 's Stories in American Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The title does not wholly indicate the character of the book , which is a collection of biographies of American writers from
1860	DATE	to
1896	DATE	.

		Much information other - wise inaccessible to children is presented , and although the author 's enthusiasm at times runs away with her , there is life in every sketch .

		The book should not only give pleasure to a studious child , but stimulate an inter - est in biography and in literature .

		One of the drollest books of the year is Mr.
Albert Stearns	PERSON	's `` Sindbad ,
Smith & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It tells how Sindbad the sailor , having drank Ponce de Leon 's wonderful fountain of youth quite dry long before that explorer was born , still pops up from cen - tury to century .

		So in the year
1896	DATE	, or thereabouts , he formed a singular partnership with a homeless little boy named
Smith	PERSON	, whose only book was the '' Arabian Nights , '' and with a man named
Brown	PERSON	, who had quite lost his memory .

		The doings and sayings of this won - derful firm are as laughable as one could well imagine .

		The illustrations , by Mr.
R. B. Birch	PERSON	, are appropriately funny and grotesque .

		A reflection of the simple charm of '' The Abbe '' Con - stantin '' may be found in Miss
Marguerite Bouvet	PERSON	's `` Pierrette '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		It is a study of the poor lace-makers in
Paris	LOCATION	, not so ambitious , perhaps , as Miss
Bouvet	PERSON	's former work , '' A Child of
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' but scarcely less attractive .

		Few American writers equal
Miss Bouvet	PERSON	in tender descriptions of forlorn children and delicate and unfortunate women .

		She also knows how to draw very odd and even striking peasant types .

		It is only when she attempts to por - tray more complex and worldly characters that she fails .

		But this in no wise detracts from the charm of ''
Pierrette	PERSON	, '' which is a purely ideal story .

		Few of the children 's books of the season have a charm so distinct as Miss
Julia R. Dabney	PERSON	's `` Little Daughter of the Sun '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The scene is laid in
Teneriffe	LOCATION	, one of the
Canary Isles	LOCATION	.

		How
Don Francisco	PERSON	and Dona
Elena	PERSON	quarrel just before their wedding day ; how
Don Francisco	PERSON	walls up the apartments intended for his bride , and lives a secluded life among his books ; how
Don Francisco	PERSON	's nephew falls in love with Dona
Elena	PERSON	's niece ; and how the old estranged lovers ,
Don Francisco	PERSON	and
Dona Elena	PERSON	, quietly marry after the younger birds have flown , all this is related in a sim - ple and piquant way that makes the little story con - spicuous among the best of its class .


Nora Perry	PERSON	's '' Three Little Daughters of the Rev - olution '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is , as might be inferred , a story of Revolutionary days .

		The three little daughters were
Dorothy Meridew	PERSON	,
Patty Endicott	PERSON	, and
Betty Barton	PERSON	.

		The story of
Patty Endicott	PERSON	repeating an innocent message in respect to the pattern of a sleeve to a British officer who demanded it , and shrewdly withholding the real message to be delivered secretly to her father , is told with much spirit , and the histori - cal setting is cleverly arranged .

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	offers the sixth of his series in the lives of American heroes , entitled '' The Wampum Belt '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , in which the interest is divided between
William Penn	LOCATION	and a typical Indian wise woman called
Faithful Heart	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	has presented his facts almost too formally for fiction , the book , well illustrated by Mr.
H. Win	PERSON	- throp
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	, will be of interest to the older children .

		Many of the fantastic and humorous traditions of Roumania found in '' Legends from River and Moun - tain '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- account for certain geological formations peculiar to the scenery of that country .

		These legends , selected by the Roumanian Queen ''
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	'' and her colldborateur Miss
Alma Strettell	PERSON	, are lighter in tone than the old Norse legends , and some of them , as '' A Legend of
Walpurgis Night	ORGANIZATION	, '' abound in homely , native humor .

		The illustrations , by Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	, are quite as weird and fantastic as the stories .

		Mr.
Norman Gale	PERSON	's '' Songs for Little People '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is a collection of quaint rhymes quaintly illus - trated by Miss
Helen Stratton	PERSON	.

		The verses are rather simple in character , designed for a place between mere 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, baby songs and the children 's poems of
Stevenson	PERSON	, which the author considers beyond the average child 's under - standing .

		A humorous expression of '' modern unrest '' in children is given in the verses called '' A Change Wanted , '' in which a little lad thinks '' its very common to be white , '' and reveals that the desire of his heart is to have some good fairy change him into a black boy so that he may go to
Africa	LOCATION	and shoot the tall giraffe .

		Mrs.
Hugh Bell	PERSON	has arranged , with great skill and taste , the most familiar of our fairy-tales in a volume of '' Fairy Tale Plays and How to Act Them '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The details are practically complete .

		Directions for costuming and for stage management , with suggestions for simple dances , accompany the fourteen plays , which are delightfully illustrated by Mr.
Lancelot	PERSON	Speed .

		The folk music which is introduced at appropriate intervals , with very simple accompaniments , could hardly have been more judiciously chosen .

		Mrs.
Bell	PERSON	has given new but effective touches of character to some of the old favorites , and the plays have a modern flavor quite appetizing .

		It is a satisfaction , for example , to have '' Cinderella '' end just before the wicked sisters are embraced and forgiven ; and to observe a good spice of naughtiness in
Little Red Riding Hood	LOCATION	.

		Those who appreciate a high standard in children 's literature will be glad to see this book .

		Young readers who would like to learn something about Dutch art will find much to interest and instruct them in Mrs.
E. W. Champney	PERSON	's '' Witch Winnie in
Holland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The book is more especially a plea for the Dutch painter Mauve ; but there are references to the manner and pictures of Mesdag ,
Neuhuys	LOCATION	,
Israel	LOCATION	, and
Maris	PERSON	, as well as the older painters like
Rubens	PERSON	and
Van Dyke	LOCATION	.

		While the criticisms are not profound , some knowledge of the spirit and influence of Dutch art may be caught from the book .

		It is well illustrated with photographs from the paintings of
Van Dyke	ORGANIZATION	, Th .

		de
Bock	PERSON	,
C. Bisschop	PERSON	,
F. J. du Chattel	PERSON	,
Mesdag	LOCATION	, and others .

		The book with the strange title of '' Gobolinks for Young and Old '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- humorously describes and illustrates many quaint and curious figures which may be made with a drop of pressed ink .

		The '' Some - things '' created by Mrs.
Ruth McEnery Stuart	PERSON	and Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	out of the '' imp of ink '' are often surprising and sometimes not inartistic .

		Gargoyles , pre - historic animals , and many unclassified creatures which the authors term '' Gobolinks , '' have been collected for the amusement of children .

		To these pictured '' gobo - links '' are attached some quaint rhymes , which some - times have a sort of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	brevity and fresh - ness Almost equally novel are two other publications from the same house , `` The Shadow Show , '' by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	, in which leaves containing colored pic - tures when held to the light reveal other and unexpected forms , to the great delight , undoubtedly , of the aston - ished youngsters ; and '' Paper Doll Poems , '' a collec - tion of pictures and verses by
Miss Pauline King Miss King	ORGANIZATION	appears also as a prose writer , in ''
Chris	PERSON	- tine 's Career '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a wholesome and attractive story of a loving and thoughtful little girl .

		The two volumes of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' for
1896	DATE	come to us in the usual red-and-gold cover , and contain the usual variety of attractive reading for the young .

		Among the short articles may be noted
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Letters to
Young Friends	ORGANIZATION	, '' and an illustrated paper by
Miss Herrick	PERSON	describing Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	's early achievements in paper-cutting , an article that has given a great impulse to paper-cutting in the public schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Harper 's Round Table '' for
1896	DATE	comes in a single volume of
1276	DATE	pages , profusely illus - trated , containing nearly a hundred short stories , about a hundred and fifty pages on modern sports and games , and an endless variety of miscellaneous reading for the young '' Chatterbox '' for
1896	DATE	is gay with many col - ored plates , as well as illustrations in black and white . ''


Sunday	DATE	, '' an annual designed for children 's
Sunday	DATE	reading , is issued in advance for
1897	DATE	, by
Messrs. E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lovers of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	will be delighted to find several old favorites which lend themselves easily to music appropriately set by Mr.
Reginald de Koven	PERSON	and others in `` Songs of Childhood '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Lullabies are numerous , and the music has that taking quality which augurs success for the publication .

		A new and very beautiful edition of Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	's ''
Hans Brinker	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will be welcomed by all who appreciate having a good story well bound and charmingly illustrated .

		The pictures , for which Mr.
Allan B. Doggett	PERSON	made a special journey to Hol - land , are extremely clever .

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a somewhat abridged edition of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Blue True Story Book '' for use as supplementary reading in schools .

		In this little work may be found some famous old stories , not too well known , such as that of Ben - venuto
Cellini	PERSON	's escape from the
Castle of St. Angelo	ORGANIZATION	.

		To these old stories Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has added some new ones , as '' The Tale of Isandula and
Rorke	PERSON	's Drift , '' a thrill - ing description of certain deeds of heroism performed during the Zulu War by British officers .

		This small but choice volume is illustrated by Messrs.
Ford	PERSON	,
Davis	PERSON	, Speed , and
Bogle	PERSON	.

		One of the most conspicuous and attractive of the season 's books of fairy tales is Miss
Evelyn Sharp	PERSON	's '' Wymps '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The stories contained in the volume are eight in number , and are written in an easy and graceful style .

		The cover design and the illustra - tions , by Mrs.
Percy Dearmer	PERSON	, are beautiful examples of color-printing , and are as interesting as the text .

		Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	's account of '' Famous Givers and Their Gifts '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- presents biographical and other information regarding Mr.
James Lick	PERSON	, Senator Stanford , Mr.
John D. Rockefeller	PERSON	, Mr.
Philip D. Armour	PERSON	, among moderns , and of
John Lowell	PERSON	, Jr. ,
Stephen Girard	PERSON	, and
James Smithson	PERSON	-LRB- founder of the
Smithsonian Institute	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- among philanthropists of an earlier time .

		The book is illustrated with portraits of nearly all the famous givers included in its category .

		Boys of a more serious turn of mind , especially if interested in industrial or commercial affairs , will find entertainment and profit in Mr.
Robert Cochrane	PERSON	's `` Romance of Industry and Invention '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The work covers a large field , ranging from the cele - brated Wedgewood-ware and its inventor , to the mod - ern developments of the bicycle and the horseless car - riage .

		Miss
Jeanie Gould Lincoln	PERSON	's story of '' A Genuine Girl '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- is a sequel to ''
Marjorie	PERSON	's Quest , '' yet is complete in itself , and introduces the reader to the best
Washington	LOCATION	society , where Cupid plays havoc among the school-girls of seventeen .

		Its Penelopes and Phyllises are clever and sweet , and the book is written with sprightly grace .

		Although that favorite writer for boys , Col.
T. W. Knox	PERSON	, has departed , a new book by him appears this
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL season , '' The Land of the Kangaroo '' -LRB-
W. A. Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		This story was the last literary work done by the author ; and as a study of the scenery and life of a country which , though unvisited by him , attracted his especial interest , the book will fairly sus - tain the reputation gained by the familiar '' Boy Trav - ellers '' series .

		Another good juvenile for lads of twelve or there - abouts is Mr.
William Henry Frost	PERSON	's '' The Court of King Arthur '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The work is not so scholarly as
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's '' The Boy 's
King Arthur	PERSON	, '' but it is in a more popular and juvenile style .

		Tennyson 's ver - sion of the Arthurian legends is closely followed , but there are additional stories from Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	and others . ''

		The Scrape that Jack Built '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is a bright little story , by Miss
Otillie A. Liljencrantz	PERSON	, showing the evil effects of bad company , without pointing the moral too plainly .

		Jack , an orphan nephew , by shielding a wicked boy and an unscrupulous man from punishment , indirectly injures his cousin and gives his stern uncle a great deal of unnecessary trouble .

		The plot and char - acters are unhackneyed , and the story is well illustrated .

		Two daintily bound books , '' Some Say '' and '' Isla Heron '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the pen of Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, are both tales of the
New England	LOCATION	life of which she writes so gracefully .

		They are of different scope ; the former , containing two short stories full of quaint humor and pleasant satire , pictures with clearness the homely virtues and petty vices of village life * '' Isla Heron , '' provided with attractive illustrations , is a much more romantic study of child life on a lonely island off the
Maine	LOCATION	coast , and relates with pathos the devotion of the wild but charming heroine to her deaf-and-dumb brother .

		The book is artistic in every way .

		The verses in '' A Boy 's Book of Rhyme '' -LRB-
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	, are so vigorous and suggestive that it is a relief to find them unhampered by illustration .

		Many a picture will nevertheless pass before the child 's fancy as he reads the book , for
Robin Hood	ORGANIZATION	,
William Tell	PERSON	, and the Caliph of
Bagdad	LOCATION	, as well as birds , beasts , and flowers , live between its artistic covers .

		A certain ease in the telling and an abundance of incident do not wholly relieve the weight of death and carnage in Mrs.
Evelyn Everett-Green	PERSON	's ''
Dominique	PERSON	's Vengeance '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a story of
France	LOCATION	and
Florida	LOCATION	in the time of the Huguenot persecutions In the same author 's story of Old
London	LOCATION	called '' The Sign of the Red Cross '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , the horrors of the Great Plague and Great Fire of
London	LOCATION	form a background for a story of devotion to humanity .

		Mr.
William M. Thayer	PERSON	's two volumes '' Men who Win '' and '' Women who Win '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- present thirty-two biographical sketches of men and women who have forced their way into prominence in various fields .

		In this curious collection such extremes meet as
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Goodyear	ORGANIZATION	, and
Agassiz	LOCATION	; Queen
Victoria	PERSON	,
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	, and
Mary Somerville	LOCATION	.

		The more serious - minded juvenile readers will find these books interest - ing reading .

		A book descriptive of the unconventional life of a spirited girl on a Southern plantation , situated near one of the estuaries of the
Chesapeake	LOCATION	, is Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	's '' Betty of Wye '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Miss
Ida Waugh	PERSON	's exquisite illustrations are a distinct addition to
Miss Blanchard	ORGANIZATION	's lively chapters .

		The scene of Mr.
J. Macdonald Oxley	PERSON	's '' Baffling the Blockade '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is also connected with the Civil War , although it is only historical as to time of action and local coloring .

		It is an exciting account of the adventures of two Southern boys on a blockade - runner sailing between
Charleston	LOCATION	and the
Bermudas	LOCATION	.

		A modest but meritorious little book of short stories is Miss
A. G. Plympton	PERSON	's `` The Black Dog , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Readers of `` St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' and '' The Outlook '' will remember these delightful sketches , the best one perhaps being '' The
River-End Morey	PERSON	's Rab . ''

		This book is prettily illustrated by the author .

		Another volume of short stories , one that will interest older readers as well as boys and girls , is ''
Walter Gibbs	PERSON	the Young Boss , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward W. Thomson	PERSON	, whom magazine readers may remember as the author of '' Old Man Savarin '' and other piquant tales of Canadian life .

		Mr.
Albion W. TourgeVs	PERSON	`` The Mortgage on the
Hip-Roof House	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a short , piquant story told in Mr. TourgeVs best manner .

		The book commends itself to the straitened pocket by its reason - able price ; it is handsomely illustrated , and on the cover is an admirable design of an old-fashioned hip - roof-house .

		Of children 's stories founded on Bible themes , the best this season is Mr.
W. 0	PERSON	.

		Stoddard 's '' The Swordmaker 's Son '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The text is well illustrated with views of oriental life and scenery , by
George Varian	PERSON	.

		Miss
Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	's '' The Mistress of Sher - burne '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a charming sequel to ''
Sherburne House	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' A
Sherburne Romance	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which we meet again the agreeable characters made familiar in the author 's earlier works .

		When a work purports to be descriptive of the life of young artists , the reader has a right to expect that the spirit of art will manifest itself in the book .

		Miss Ernes - tine Helm 's '' The Young Artists '' -LRB-
Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , translated by Miss
Mary E. Ireland	PERSON	, may be a picture of German life and society , but it is not a picture of life in the studio .

		The same criticism may be made in respect to Miss
L. J. Meade	PERSON	's ''
Catalina	LOCATION	, Art Student '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		As a picture of English life and society , it is a success ; as a picture of the art-life of a
London	LOCATION	girl , it is a failure , for the reason that the author does not succeed in placing
Catalina	LOCATION	in an art atmosphere .

		In noticing a book by Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	in these columns last year , attention was called to his de - plorable carelessness in the construction of his sen - tences .

		A like criticism may be made this year in respect to a new book by that author , '' Three Young Continentals '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a striking picture of the American Revolution ; but it is not written in good English , and hence is not to be commended .

		Another book by Mr.
Tomlinson	PERSON	, and one written with more care than the preceding , is ''
Tecumseh	PERSON	's Young Braves '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The boys in Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's '' Under the Liberty Tree '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have a sort of Colonial dig - nity which accords with the stirring ante-Revolutionary days in which they lived .

		This story of the ''
Boston Massacre	ORGANIZATION	'' is the fifth in an '' American History Series '' by this author ; and , with its illustrations by Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	, is well suited to the home or school library .

		In `` The Young Salesman '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Horatio Alger	PERSON	, Jr. , tells how a poor young English orphan , land - ing in
New York	LOCATION	with a small sum of money , becomes , without apparent effort , an earl 's friend , a merchant prince , and a general philanthropist to small boys .

		Though without literary merit , the book is not wholly 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, lacking in interest The same publishers bring out `` The Young Game - Warden , '' by Mr.
Harry Castlemon	PERSON	, which tells how courage and faithfulness are rewarded , and even villains made repentant , by the hero 's conscientious attention to duty .

		Mr.
J. Macdonald Oxley	PERSON	's '' The Boy Tramps ; or , Across
Canada	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is full of pleasing descrip - tions of the picturesque Canadian cities and of the grand scenery to be found in
British America	LOCATION	.

		The illustra - tions , by Mr.
Henry Sandham	PERSON	, are full of life and spirit Other books of travel and adventure are Mr.
Herbert Hayen	PERSON	's '' Clevely Sahib '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , a well - told story of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	in the exciting times of
1840	DATE	and ' 41 ; Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	's `` The Windfall '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , a wholesome and natural tale of life and danger in a coal-mine , with few but appropriate illustra - tions ;
Oliver Optic	PERSON	's `` Four Young Explorers '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , giving much natural history and other infor - mation of
Borneo	LOCATION	,
