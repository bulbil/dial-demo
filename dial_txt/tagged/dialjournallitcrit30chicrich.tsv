		23 THE GREAT BOOKS OF THE CENTURY .

		On
this first day of the twentieth century	DATE	there can be no subject more suitable for dis - cussion in the pages of a literary journal than that of the famous books produced during the century just ended .

		The subject is one that has already received a certain amount of atten - tion in other quarters , and that will doubtless be handled by many sorts of pens during the coming months .

		It is a subject of deep and enduring interest , because it affords one way , at least , and probably the most important way , of determining what the nineteenth century has done for civilization .

		We propose to confine our attention , in the present article , to the books of thought as distinguished from the books of art , and to enumerate , with some sort of brief accompanying comment , some of the works of the century that may fairly be char - acterized as epoch-making ; the books , in a word , that have opened men 's eyes to a deeper view of scientific or philosophical truth , and have made permanent changes in the current of human thought .

		Considered in this respect , the book of the century , beyond any possibility of a successful challenge to its preeminence , is '' The Origin of Species , '' by
Charles Darwin	PERSON	.

		The influence of this book ranks it with the treatises of Co - pernicus and of
Newton	LOCATION	, with the '' Contrat Social '' and the '' Wealth of Nations . ''

		It is doubtful if any other book , in all the history of modern thought , has been so far-reaching in its influence , or productive of such immense intellectual results .

		There is a difference , not merely of degree but almost of kind , between the intellectual processes of the men who lived before
Darwin	PERSON	and those who have grown to manhood during the period in which the evo - lutionary leaven has been working in men 's minds .

		We no longer think in the same terms as of old , and we see that the true measure of the power of the great thinkers of the past is to be found in the extent to which their work foreshadowed or anticipated the evolutionary method .

		It is because the influence of
Darwin	PERSON	has THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, thus extended far beyond the biological field in which his work was done that his most famous book stands thus preeminent .

		Among the books that have proved epoch-making in more restricted fields of thought , we may men - tion
Lyell	PERSON	's '' Principles of Geology , '' Helm - holtz 's '' Tonempfindungen , ''
Froebel	PERSON	's '' Edu - cation of Man , ''
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' Modern Painters , '' and
Maine	LOCATION	's `` Ancient Law . ''

		The science of comparative philology , which hardly existed before
the nineteenth century	DATE	, dates from the publication of
Bopp	PERSON	's '' Comparative Gram - mar '' ; and the scientific pursuit of historical scholarship , whose ideals are very different from those of the eighteenth century histo - rians , although
Gibbon	PERSON	did much to anticipate them , really began with the publication of
Niebuhr	ORGANIZATION	's '' Romische Geschichte . ''

		Dalton 's '' New System of Chemical Philosophy '' laid the foundations for atomic chemistry , and the `` Mecanique Celeste '' of
Laplace	LOCATION	provided a firm mathematical basis for the nebular theory , previously outlined , it is true , by
Kant	PERSON	, but lacking in the confirmation that was brought to it by the masterly analysis of the French astronomer .

		Here is also the appropriate place for mention of the researches of Pasteur , which have proved so immensely fruitful in the do - main of bacteriology , and upon which , more than upon the labors of any other investi - gator , the new science is based .

		To the work of Pasteur and his followers we owe the first rational theory of disease and its treatment that has ever been formulated , a somewhat surprising fact when we consider the paramount importance of the subject to mankind .

		What were once supposed to be the founda - tions of religious belief have , during the cen - tury just ended , been sapped and mined by many agencies .

		The study of ancient civiliza - tions has proved to be the merest fables many things that the credulous ' earlier ages accepted without question .

		The new scientific view of man and nature has also brought about a silent transformation in many matters of opinion once thought to be indissolubly connected with religious belief , but now seen to have little or nothing to do with it .

		As far as religion is a question of the interpretation of the Scriptures , the historical methods that have dealt so effect - ively with Greek and Roman tradition have also made an enduring impression upon the traditions of the Hebrew people and of the .

		Christian church .

		The `` higher '' criticism , which means simply the new historical criti - cism of sources and ideas , has triumphed so completely that little in the way of superstition is left for it to slay .

		Many men have fought valiantly in this cause , and it is difficult to specify individual scholars .

		But if our test be that of direct influence upon great numbers of people , it is probably true that the '' Leben Jesu '' of
Strauss	PERSON	and the '' Vie de Jesus '' of Ren an have been the most important popular agencies in bringing about a restoration of the Christian religion to its proper place in the perspective of general history .

		In the domain of economics , the most influ - ential book of the century has probably been one whose teachings are repudiated by those who have the best right to speak in the name of this science .

		The propaganda of socialism has become so marked a feature in the political life of most of the civilized nations that it can - not be ignored in any survey of the tendencies of nineteenth century thought , and credit must be given to the book which , more than any other , has been responsible for this movement .

		That book , it need hardly be added , is the '' Kapital '' of
Karl Marx	PERSON	; and its force is not yet spent .

		Indeed , we are inclined to think that fifty years hence it will loom even larger than it now does among the writ - ings that have most profoundly influenced the thought of modern times .

		For the socialist experiment has not yet worked itself out , and it will not be discredited until civilization has suffered some very rude shocks .

		Mill 's '' Political Economy , '' on the other hand , while it has profoundly influenced the real thinkers in this field , and has an absolute value far exceeding that of ''
Das Kapital	PERSON	, '' falls short of being an epoch-making book for the simple reason that , instead of setting new ideas in motion , its energy was devoted to clarifying the old ones , and to setting them forth in logical arrangement .

		It is still the best single treatise on political economy that has ever been written , and for this , at least , it deserves an honorable place in any review of the intellectual history of the nineteenth cen - tury .

		We are inclined to give a place in this connection to the writings upon political and social subjects of the great apostle of Italian unity ,
Guiseppe Mazzini	PERSON	.

		It is not merely because they brought about the political regen - eration of his own country that these writings are of the highest importance although that would suffice to justify the estimate but rather because they brought the element of spirituality into the discussions with which
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , they were concerned , and supplemented the conception of the rights of man , of which something too much had been made during the period that followed the French Revolution , with the hitherto neglected conception of the duties of man , thus giving an ethical turn to the general movement of European emancipa - tion , and allying it with something higher and finer than merely material interests .

		The teaching of
Mazzini	PERSON	, enforced by the singular purity and nobility of his devoted life , has had a widespread influence upon political thought , and has given it an ethical impulse that would be difficult to overestimate .

		Turning last of all to the philosophers , that is , to the men who , as far as may be , take all knowledge for their province , and seek to sys - tematize the various results of special intel - lectual activity , we find the names of Humboldt ,
Hegel	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Comte	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	to be the conspicuous names of the nineteenth century .

		The '' Kosmos '' of
Alexander	PERSON	von Humboldt marks , in a sense , the end of the period of general scholarship and the beginning of the period in which specialization has held full sway .

		Never again can anyone hope to master the scientific knowledge of his time in the sense in which Humboldt mastered it ; even the magnificent achievement of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	falls short of that ideal and shows the futility of any further en - deavor in that direction .

		We owe to Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	the most thorough-going application of the conception of evolution to history that has ever been made , and that is glory enough for one man ; but we can not read his '' Synthetic Philosophy '' without at the same time realizing that there are gaps in his knowledge and de - fects in his philosophical comprehension .

		We have the same feeling in more marked degree when we read Comte ; and in his case , while recognizing his great influence , we must admit that it is an influence no longer active .

		Even the eloquence of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	can not galvanize the '' Cours de Philosophic Positive '' into any semblance of the life that left it a generation ago .

		Nevertheless , it will always be reckoned among the most influential books of the century just ended .

		Taking philosophy in the stricter sense , as primarily concerned with the ultimate problems of thought , the names of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	and of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	stand preeminent in the history of the nineteenth century .

		The '' Logic '' of the one and '' Die Welt als
Wille	PERSON	und Vorstellung '' of the other have been the chief metaphysical forces of the period , although now , at the end of the period , we see that the foimer is a waning influence , while the latter is an influence still to be taken into account in any study of the forces which still sway the minds of thoughtful men .

		It supplies , better than any other metaphysical system yet produced , the needed corrective for that material view of the universe which would seem to be the outcome of modern science , and enforces the fundamental teachings of the philosophers of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and
Berkeley	LOCATION	, and
Kant	PERSON	in the terms of the modern intellect , and with a cogency that is irresistible to the logical mind .

		We are inclined to believe that if the '' Origin of Species '' is approached in its influence upon nineteenth-century thought by any other one book , '' Die Welt als
Wille	PERSON	und
Vorstel	PERSON	- lung '' is that book .

		THE CASE AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY	ORGANIZATION	.

		The recent case of alleged `` interference with the freedom of academic teaching '' at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	has called oat a range of discussion and criticism that seems to us disproportionate to the importance of the case .

		It was , of coarse , to be expected that the matter would be made the most of by sensation-seeking newspapers , and those of
California	LOCATION	in particular seem to have improved their opportunities without much regard to the finer equities or to the injury they might be doing the institution and those who have made it one of the chief glories of their State .

		Into the details of the affair we do not now propose to go .

		Broadly viewed , it seems less a question of academic free - dom than of academic common-sense .

		It appears that an instructor was asked to resign his position , as he claims , on account of some sentiments , altered by him in a public speech , which were objectionable to the founder of the
University	ORGANIZATION	; as the other side claims , on account of an antagonism of long stand - ing , aggravated by some offensive reference s to the family of the founder , the instructor questioning in his class-room the legitimacy of the fortune by which the
University	ORGANIZATION	had been established , while not scrupling to accept a portion of the same for - tune in payment of his professorial salary .

		Now if these things were true , or Mrs.
Stanford	PERSON	believed them to be true , her resentment was natural and inevitable : and in any event , it seems to us that such generous devotion and boundless liberality as she has shown to the institution whose welfare lies so near her heart might fairly have entitled her to more considerate and more kindly treatment than she has received from some quarters .

		We do not believe , from all we know of this case , that the 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, principle of freedom in teaching is in any serious danger at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It certainly could not suffer at the hands of President
Jordan	PERSON	, who was sufficiently well known both for character and scholarship before he went out to make
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	one of the greatest civilizing influences , and himself one of the greatest individual forces for good , on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		A body of one hundred electors , composed of twenty - five university or college presidents , twenty-six profes - sors of history and scientists , twenty-six editors and authors and publicists , and twenty-three supreme court judges ,
State	ORGANIZATION	and National '' representing the wisdom of the American people , '' these are the jurymen who have failed to find a place for
Poe	PERSON	in an
American Hall of Fame	ORGANIZATION	.

		Literary
England	LOCATION	, and particularly Mr.
Edmund W. Gosse	PERSON	, would doubtless question that '' wisdom '' which shows itself in undervaluing Art .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	regards
Poe	PERSON	as our most perfect , most original , and most exquisite poet , and says that were he an American Ire would consider the nation 's failure to appreciate him extraordinary , sinister , and disastrous .

		THE DIAL 'S symposium on '' The American Rejec - tion of
Poe	PERSON	, '' a year or two ago , brought out many warm defenders of the poet , one of whom wrote : ''
Poe	PERSON	, in my judgment , was the greatest intellect
America	LOCATION	has produced assuredly the best artist .

		His tales seem to me the third collection in point of merit in literature the other two being the Arabian Nights and
Boccaccio	PERSON	. ''

		And another : '' Of all the American poets of the day ,
Poe	PERSON	alone fades not .

		The rest have lost color .

		They worked in daguerreotype ; he painted in oil . ''

		And still another : '' One great good thing in a poet like
Poe	PERSON	is that he shows what art for art 's sake can do .

		We in
America	LOCATION	need no incitement to value literature for its practical worth .

		We do not need to be told that thought is important , for we know it .

		But we do need to be told that art , or style , is of value , for as a rule we are not so much on the lookout for that . ''

		Why are these defenders of the poet silent now in ` the face of this fresh injustice to his memory ?

		In imagination , creative faculty , analysis , and origi - nality ,
Poe	PERSON	has but one rival in American literature .

		In musical poetry in the marvellous use he made of the power which the great god Pan blew into him '' none sing so wildly well . ''

		To undervalue him because he left behind him no Emersonian rules of life and conduct because the glory of his matchless rhyme does not lie in '' teaching men how to live well '' is as absurd as it would be to undervalue Chopin because he did not write the Sonatas of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the ''
Hall	PERSON	of Fame '' is a private enterprise , its final significance may perhaps be questioned ; but as it is the only thing of its kind we have or may for some time have in
America	LOCATION	, its meaning to the American people will grow in importance with the years , and it is as well to treat it seriously .

		Resolution Six of the rules adopted by the
Univer	LOCATION	- sity
Senate	ORGANIZATION	relating to the nomination of candidates states that '' Any nomination by any citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	that shall be addressed to the
New York University Senate	ORGANIZATION	' shall be received and con - sidered by that body . ''

		Why should not all lovers of
Poe	PERSON	avail themselves of the opportunity therein afforded to place his name in nomination ?

San Francisco	LOCATION	,
December 15 , 1900	DATE	.

		A DISCREDITED MUSEUM OF ETRUSCAN ARCHEOLOGY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		A recent pamphlet by a young Italian excavator ,
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Fausto Benedetti	PERSON	, treats of matters which , though of immediate importance to only a small group of specialists in Etruscan archaeology , are indirectly of interest to a much wider public .

		For they affect the scientific standing and the official honor of
Comm	ORGANIZATION	.

		Barnabei , who was lately Director of Antiquities and Fine Arts for the kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	, and is reported to be seeking reinstatement in the same position ; and no cultivated visitor to
Italy	LOCATION	, no friend anywhere of Italian art and antiquities , can afford to be indifferent to the manner in which that office is administered .

		In
1888	DATE	a museum was established in the
Villa Ginlia	LOCATION	, situated a half mile or so outside the
Porta del Popolo	LOCATION	, and this museum has been stocked chiefly with objects found in the territory of the ancient
Falerii	PERSON	, the necropolis of Narce having furnished a large share of the material .

		This material is professedly arranged according to tombs , the contents of each tomb by themselves ; and this separation is all-important for scientific purposes , inasmuch as the tombs belong to different epochs of Etruscan civilization .

		The objects from
Narce	ORGANIZATION	have been elaborately described and dis - cussed in Volume IV .

		of the ''
Monumenti Antichi	PERSON	, '' the sumptuous archaeological periodical issued by the
Accademia dei Lincei	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far as appearances went , the arrangement in the museum and the publication in the '' Monumenti Antichi '' were controlled by a scientific rigor worthy of all praise .

		But disquieting charges in regard to this point have for some time been current ; and now , on the heels of a whitewashing report made by a governmental commission , there comes a convincing attack from the hand of
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Benedetti , who conducted the excavations at
Narce	ORGANIZATION	as a private enterprise of his father 's and his own .

		The title of his pamphlet is ''
Gli Scavi di Narce	ORGANIZATION	ed il Museo di Villa Ginlia '' -LSB- The Excavations at
Narce	ORGANIZATION	and the
Villa Ginlia Museum	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- ; and it is published in
Turin	LOCATION	by
Loescher	PERSON	, and in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		The author was only fifteen years old when , in
1889	DATE	, he began his work at
Narce	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has presumably had but little education , and the wonder is that he writes as well as he does .

		He tells his story calmly , with every appearance of frankness and with full recognition of his own limitations .

		Moreover , he quotes extensively from documentary evidence which it is impossible to regard as falsified .

		So far as the present reviewer
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL can make ont from the evidence before him ,
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Ben	PERSON	- edetti completely establishes his case .

		It appears that the museum in the
Villa Ginlia	LOCATION	has been managed with the grossest laxity and falsity .

		No pains were taken to secure adequate records of the excavations , and such information as the young exca - vator was able to supply was disregarded and his memoranda were actually destroyed .

		The plans of the various cemeteries and of the individual tombs pub - lished in the '' Monumenti Antichi '' are inaccurate or wholly imaginary , and the contents of the various tombs have been hopelessly confused .

		With good reason may
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Benedetti write -LRB- page 44 -RRB- : `` My labor has been lost , and the loss can never be recov - ered . ''

		It is a deplorable story , but it is better that the truth should be known .

		If the injury done is beyond repair , at least it is to be hoped that the present Minister of Public Instruction in
Italy	LOCATION	and his suc - cessors may see to it that no such scandal in the De - partment of Antiquities and Fine Arts shall again be possible .

		READING SHAKESPEARE AS A DUTY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Apropos of Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's remarks , in the last issue of THE DIAL , on my expression , '' We read Shakespeare as a duty , '' in the previous number , I may be permitted to explain that '' we '' does not implicate my critic nor others .

		However , I suspect that most educated people , if they were frank to confess , would acknowledge that while they enjoy
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dramas as acted the true test of the drama they do not find them special favorites as read .

		Though Shakespeare is said by many critics to be equally adapted to the stage and the closet , yet , as a matter of fact , he is rarely read save per - functorily by college instructors and classes and by some precieuses .

		In short we are growing beyond the Shakespeare idolatry period , just as we are growing beyond the period of the idolatry of the
Grseco	LOCATION	- Roman classics .

		Like
Milton	PERSON	and the
Bible	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	lies unopened in most cultivated homes from one year 's end to another , at least as far as spontaneous pleasurable reading goes .

		If an honest census were made of those who , daily , weekly , or even monthly , turn to the read - ing of Shakespeare '' with delight , '' their number would be found to be amazingly small .

		For those few , how - ever , I have admiration and even envy ; but I am un - willing to admit them as the sole representatives of the children of light , and the saving remnant from
Philis	LOCATION	- tinism in this generation .

		EARLY this year will be published Prof.
A. Campbell Fraser	PERSON	's new edition , in four volumes , of the Complete Woris of

		Professor
Fraser	PERSON	has thoroughly revised and recast his previous edition of the Works , published in three octavo volumes at the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	in
1871	DATE	, and now out of print .

		The Introductions and Notes have been practically re-written ; and a brief new biography will be prefixed .

		All fresh materials that have come to light within the last thirty years have been incorporated throughout ; and this may be regarded as the final Oxford edition of the great Irish Philosopher .

		LETTER-WRITER AXD POET .

		* Now and then there crops up in print a new collection of letters , like
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	's or Smeth - am 's or
Stevenson	PERSON	's , good enough to set review - ers of the sanguine sort to hailing cheerfully a revival of the long-mourned-as-lost art of letter - writing .

		Such is the case with the two trim volumes now before us , the Letters of
Thomas Edward Brown	PERSON	; and it should be said , and noted as a favorable sign , that the marked stir of interest caused by them is the result of the intrinsic and generally unlooked-for merit of the letters themselves , and not of the celebrity of the writer ,
Brown	PERSON	's public , even in his own country , not having been a large one .

		An author of no wide vogue at home ,
Brown	PERSON	has been , we think , even less known in Amer - ica : and hence a word or so about him now , a statement of the main facts in his not very eventful career , prefatory to the foretaste we propose giving through quotation of his cer - tainly remarkable letters , may not come amiss .

		He was born in the Isle of Man in
1830	DATE	, and died in
1897	DATE	.

		His father , the Rev.
Robert Brown	PERSON	, Vicar of
Kirk Braddan	PERSON	, near
Douglas	PERSON	, was a writer and preacher of something more than local repute a sort of
Grandison	PERSON	of the pen -LRB- as we gather from the notice of him by the editor of the Letters -RRB- , who was so nice in his notions of literary deportment that he used to '' make his son read to him some fragment of an English classic before answering an in - vitation . ''

		At fifteen
Brown	PERSON	went to
King William	LOCATION	's College , where he distinguished him - self in verse composition ,
Greek	LOCATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, and English , and developed that distaste for math - ematics so often coupled with the literary gift .

		An old schoolfellow ,
Archdeacon Wilson	PERSON	, thus speaks of him : '' I can well remember , as a small boy of eleven , just placed in the fifth class at
King William	LOCATION	's College , having
Brown	PERSON	pointed ont to me , not without awe .

		He was said to ' know more than any master ! '

		and to have written the best Latin prose that the
University	ORGANIZATION	exam - iners had ever seen ! '

		... Of course he never saw or spoke to a youngster like me . ''

		The '' of course '' can only be appreciated by those who know from some experience what LETTERS OF

		10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the '' head boy '' of an English school is to his cringing and reverential juniors , who are only too glad to blacken his boots , and fetch and carry for him like so many spaniels .

		The drop from this high estate of '' head boy '' to the quasi-menial one of a servitorship at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, whither he went in
1849	DATE	, was a trying one for
Brown	PERSON	, as is bitterly indicated in an article on the position of a servitor at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in his time , which he wrote years after for ''
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's Magazine . ''

		But to Oxford he went , and his academical career there is described as a peculiarly brilliant one .

		He not only won a double First Class in
1853	DATE	, but found himself , in
1854	DATE	, '' in the proud position of a Fellow of
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	'' as Dr.
Fowler	PERSON	records with academic unction .

		The life of an
Oxford Fellow	ORGANIZATION	was not , how - ever , one to
Brown	PERSON	's liking .

		He had no wish , he said , to '' fatten on a Fellowship , '' nor did a Tutorship attract him ; so after a few terms with private pupils he returned to the Isle of Man , and became Vice-Principal of
King William 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then he went to the
Crypt School	ORGANIZATION	, at
Gloucester	LOCATION	, where his friend Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	was his pupil .

		After a brief stay at
Gloucester	LOCATION	he was asked to take the Modern Side at
Clifton College	ORGANIZATION	,
Bristol	LOCATION	; and there he remained as a master for thirty-six years , leading a life outwardly uneventful but intellectually rich , and productive of work of which the world has taken too little notice .

		All his published poems were written , and most of them were published , while he was at Clifton ''
Betsy Lee	PERSON	, '' in
1873	DATE	; Fo ` c 's ` le Yarns '' -LRB- including `` Betsy Lee '' -RRB- , in .1881 , and in
1889	DATE	; `` The Doctor and Other Poems , '' in
1887	DATE	; '' The Manx Witch and Other Poems , '' in
1889	DATE	; and '' Old John and Other Poems , '' in
1893	DATE	.

		These works have now been gathered into a rather thick volume of Collected Poems , which comes to us almost simultaneously with the Letters .

		A former pupil at
Clifton	LOCATION	, Mr.
H. F. Brown	PERSON	-LRB- the author , if we remember rightly , of an ad - mirable book on
Venice	LOCATION	-RRB- , writes as follows of the impression he retained of his old master 's strong and somewhat rugged personality : '' He never spoke to me out of school , and I never knew him at all privately or socially at that time , but his personality made a great impression ; his slow sort of urgent walk , like Leviathan , his thick massive figure , above all his voice .

		I used to see him in the distance on his lonely strolls about the downs , and his figure seemed to belong to and to explain the downs , the river , the woods , the Severn , and the far Welsh hills .

		I remem - ber him walking in the rain , and looking as if he liked it , as I did .

		Personally , at that time I was afraid of him ; but he stirred fancy , curiosity , imagination .

		I should say that his educational function lay in ' widen - ing . '

		He was a ' widener . '

		He made one feel that there was something beyond the school , beyond success - ful performances at lessons or at games ; there was a whiff of the great world brought iu by him . ''

		Brown 's letters , as selected for publication by Mr.
Sidney T. Irwin	PERSON	, the editor of these volumes and long a colleague of
Brown	PERSON	's at
Clifton	LOCATION	, extend chronologically from
1851	DATE	, or the period of the author 's undergraduateship , to
1897	DATE	, the year of his death .

		Whatever faults may have been ascribed to
Brown	PERSON	in his - lifetime , no one ever thought of calling him commonplace .

		His mind was one of quite un - usual turn and content ; and he gave it free - rein in his letters .

		He liked , as he said , '' to - please his friends '' ; and when he took pen in hand to write to a friend he poured out with - out stint the best he could say or fancy of the topic in hand .

		He did not '' keep his best for the printer , '' for he was singularly indifferent to general recognition , and had no need of slaving for that difficult and fickle taskmaster and patron , the public .

		The not too wide circle of his chosen friends was the public he served by choice , and the one whose approval he valued most .

		His love of nature was profound , and sought frequent expression in word-paintings ^ a little rhapsodic at times , but often of marked power and beauty , as in the following picture of the Jungfrau : '' So the
Jungfrau	LOCATION	vis-a-vis-es you frankly through the bright sweet intervening air ... One evening our sunset was the real rose-pink you have heard of so much .

		It fades , you know , into a death-like chalk - white .

		That is the most awful thing .

		A sort of spasm seems to come over her face , and in an instant she is a corpse , rigid , and oh so cold !

		Well , so she died , and you felt as if a great soul had ebbed away into the Heaven of Heavens : and thankful , but very sad , I went up to nay room .

		I was reading by candle-light , for it gets dark immediately after sunset , when A. shrieked to me to come to the window .

		What a Resurrection so gentle , so tender like that sonnet of
Milton	LOCATION	's about his dead wife returning in a vision !

		The moon had risen ; and there was the
Jungfrau	LOCATION	oh , chaste , oh , blessed saint in glory everlasting !

		Then all the ele - mental spirits that haunt crevasses , and hover around peaks , all the patient powers that bear up the rocky buttresses , and labor to sustain great slopes , all streams , , and drifts , and flowers , and vapors , made a symphony , a time most solemn and rapturous .

		... A young Swiss felt it , and with exquisite delicacy feeling his way , as .

		it were , to some expression , however inadequate , he played a sonata of
Schumann	LOCATION	, and one or two of the songs , such as the Friihlingsnacht . ''

		That
Brown	PERSON	had in a high degree the artist 's love of expression for its own sake is more evident in the following characteristic notelet :
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 ''
Last night	DATE	I had a ramble which it would be hard to describe .

		I went round aud round something ; probably myself .

		One point there was upon the cir - cumference a spark a ship working her way up channel against wind and tide .

		The ship was invisible in the gloom , but the light what intense yearning !

		and what pluck and energy too !

		It was like a red diamond , if there be such a thing , boring into black - ness .

		I could almost hear the rip-rip of the severing sheets of darkness ; or perhaps , rather , a delicate hum of the gritty grating stuff through which she had to pass .

		But no , I return to the first idea .

		The borer , the red diamond piercing the black marble . ''

		To many readers not of the now ruling generation the following note -LRB- 1881 -RRB- on Car - lyle 's death will be gratefully intelligible : '' And True
Thomas	PERSON	' is gone .

		What has he not been to men of my generation ?

		And the younger men come and ask one What was it ?

		What did he teach ?

		and so forth ; and , of course , there is nothing to be said in that direction .

		And , if one mumbles something be - tween one 's teeth -LRB- impatiently , rather like a half - chewed curse -RRB- something about a Baptism of fire my graceful adolescents look shocked , and , for the most part , repeat the question , ' Yes , yes , but what did he teach ? '

		To which -LRB- I mean when repeated -RRB- there is no possible reply , but the honest outspoken ' 1 -RRB- . ' ''

		The note on
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	naturally leads up to the following amusing dissertation on genius , evidently in reply to a friend 's plaint of a par - ticular instance of the proverbial seamy side of the man of genius .

		`` A genius !

		that 's it .

		And they are all like that , almost all .

		Those little falsetti , and affectations , and posings , and putting the best foot foremost ; those cravings for appreciation , the egotism , the self-con - sciousness -LRB- go ahead ! -RRB-

		, all characterize the genius .

		You must take him with them take him or leave him alone .

		But you seem to seek a portent !

		a man of genius and a man of hard practical common-sense knocked into one .

		The world has produced half a dozen such men .

		They are tremendous .

		But Heaven help us !

		you must be content with some - thing less than this , or Nature will never get her men off her hands . '

		Sell me a genius , ' say you .

		Here .

		you are , ' says
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, handing over a lot , ' plenty of choice : marked in figures ; read
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	' ' Oh , I want ' Well , what do jou want ? ' '

		A strong , powerful , healthy intellect , and genius as a dooragh . '

		* ' Oh , thank you for nothing !

		We do n't make them .

		You had better try the shop over the way , or give a special order , and we can try , provided you are willing to wait a thousand years or o ! '

		... This ` rift within the lute ' of genius is the inseparable accident ... I have no doubt that to many of us it were better if we never got to know men of genius privately .

		You may depend upon it that , throughout the history of literature , they offended their contemporaries by their airs and their bosh , their petti - uess aud their asinine conceit .

		Never mind !

		The world has taken its hat off to these men , and so must we .

		We need not stroke the quills on the ' back of the fretful porpeutine ' ; let us avoid coming into too close contact .

		Perhaps some of them had better be kept in * I. e. , `` genius to boot . ''

		cages .

		But chance may domesticate you with one ; you may , for instance , marry one .

		Poor Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	! ''

		On the following somewhat satirical passage from a letter of
1895	DATE	, comment were superfluous . ''

		Have you seen Mat .

		Arnold 's Letters * I hear of a Penny Mat .

		Arnold published by Stead -LRB- / / -RRB- .

		Is that possible ?

		And to be followed by a Penny Clough !

		Did yon ever ?

		Is he publishing them in penny num - bers ?

		the whole to cost a lot ?

		Or , positively , can we have Mat .

		the whole nnmntilated Mat for a penny ?

		And by
Stead f Wonders	ORGANIZATION	will never cease .

		Fancy Mat. , from that fair heaven which now holds his dainty ghost , stooping to sniff , etc. ... Still , one has the consolation of thinking that he must be amused when he beholds waving a censor in his temple such a high-priest as Stead amused yes , and note the shrinking nostril , how it curves ! ''

		The foregoing quotations should suffice to show the general tone and the genre of
Brown	PERSON	's letters , and to establish the point , at least , that commonness is the last quality to be predicated of them .

		Their diversity , their rich allusive - ness , their swift spontaneity , their protean mutability of mood , their odd humor , we have but faintly indicated .

		All in all , they seem to us to form one of the richest and most original collections of the kind of recent years .

		Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	has done his editing well and helpfully , in the main ; but for some inscrutable reason the volumes were issued without an Index , which they especially need .

		This omission we trust to see supplied in the forthcoming second edition of the Letters , already called for .

		The volumes are well printed , though not without an occasional slip in the spelling , for in - stance , '' Olnet '' for Ohnet , on page 220 , and '' Cuddie '' for Caddy , on page 208 .

		The popularity of
Brown	PERSON	's letters will doubt - less send people to reading , or re-reading , his poems ; and hence the convenient volume of '' Collected Poems of
T. E. Brown	PERSON	'' recently issued by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	comes with especial timeliness .

		The not very poetic Manx dialect with which not a few of these earnest but somewhat rugged productions are plenti - fully sprinkled may prove an obstacle to some readers ; and we should think that a taste for
Brown	PERSON	's poetry must in general be something of an acquired one .

		But once acquired it will be likely to abide , and to prove a source of no small joy and profit of the high sort that genuine poetry alone , with a strain of broad human sympathy in it , can give .

		The volume contains 736 compact pages , and is the latest number of its publishers ' admirable series of Uniform Editions of the Poets , including such masters as
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	.

		A fine portrait of the author forms the frontispiece .

		E. G. J. 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, CHRISTIANITY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	BEFORE
COLUMBUS	LOCATION	.

		* In these days of easy authorship and half - matured production , it is a strengthening of faith in the survival of learning to take up two large volumes that show research and investi - gation requiring many years of patient labor .

		To attempt even a cursory examination of the multitude of myths and legends on the rela - tions between the Old and the New worlds prior to
Columbus	LOCATION	is a task that might dissuade any save a scholar who works under the in - centive of religious zeal and writes from a fixed purpose .

		Fifteen pages of closely-printed bibliography reveal a searching investigation that extends backward from the '' moneron '' of
Darwin	PERSON	to the voyages of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		In addition to the printed authorities , two pages of manuscripts and archives , mostly in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, are included .

		The Bible , Humboldt 's JExamen Critique , and
Herrera	PERSON	's Historia General are most frequently cited .

		Such an exhaustive list of authorities on the relations between the two hemispheres prior to
Columbus	LOCATION	is rarely met with .

		Rejecting , on religious grounds , the theory of evolution , which he terms '' the fashionable school of science sprung up during the latter half of our century , '' as also the suggestion that the American aborigines were pre -
Adam	PERSON	- ites , the author proceeds to examine the
Cave Dwellers	ORGANIZATION	and the Mound Builders as types of people separate from the Indians of
Columbus	LOCATION	, and possessing a higher civilization , whose origin must be accounted for .

		Such advanced state is also indicated by ruins in
Central America	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	, and
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		Simi - larity between the traditions of the aborigines and the descriptions of the Old Testament forms further proof of a pre-Christian civili - zation .

		As a means of crossing the waters , the author seems to accept
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's Atlantis , as nearly as he expresses a definite opinion on any point raised .

		Seeking the peoples by whom this civilization was brought from the Old world to the New , he rejects the Phoenicians , Jews , pre-Christian Irish , Romans , and Afri - cans , and , by the law of elimination , is '' in - clined to believe '' that these traditions were '' brought into
America	LOCATION	by the nearest descen - dants of the patriarch
Noe	PERSON	, who had taken their course in an easterly direction , landing * HISTORY OF

Polynesia	ORGANIZATION	, on the western coast of
Central America	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	. ''

		Accord - ing to this hypothesis , Christianity becomes
America	LOCATION	's '' second civilizer . ''

		Finding here his real thesis , the author an - nounces the apostle St.
Thomas	PERSON	as the agent who brought Christianity to early
America	LOCATION	, although that St.
James	PERSON	or St.
Paul	PERSON	came is not '' an unreasonable induction . ''

		Anticipating the objection that human agencies were wanting in those days for such journeys , the writer takes refuge in the superhuman or the miracu - lous . ''

		Is not the whole establishment of Christianity one single great miracle too little noticed ? ''

		Discussion of this point resolves itself into the old controversy between the Spanish church which claimed the credit for the evangelization of
America	LOCATION	, and the other Roman Catholic nations which objected to such a monopoly .

		An examination of the rites of the western savages further strengthens the hypothesis of a pre-Columbian Christianity .

		Crude forms of the confessional are found , as well as baptism , the eucharist , convents , monasteries , and celi - bates .

		Penance is not uncommon ; but when penance becomes self-torture , it ceases to be a church function , according to the author , and becomes one of '' Satan 's rites . ''

		Numerous witnesses are found to testify to the finding of the crucifix among so-called heathen emblems j of the representation of a man fastened to a cross ; of the expectation of a Messiah , and even his birth from a virgin .

		The people of
Ireland	LOCATION	seem the most likely agents who disseminated this knowledge of the church in
America	LOCATION	.

		That no trace of them remains is due to their relapsing into barbar - ism .

		Traditions of the Welsh in
America	LOCATION	, the delightful crux of our scientific ancestors , are explained by a similar appearance and disappearance of that people .

		The claims of the Scandinavians are examined through the sagas , indubitable evidences of them being found all along the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast from
New York	LOCATION	to
New Foundland	LOCATION	.

		Between these Norsemen and
Columbus	LOCATION	, the author finds a host of daring men who crossed the '' great Sea of Darkness , '' thus enabling him to pro- claim with evident satisfaction his summing ; up , that '' knowledge and not genius directed the voyages of
Columbus	LOCATION	. ''

Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, the author could not avoid a pardonable pride in the early

		THE DIAL 13 achievements of his church and a resulting ten - dency to favor her claims .

		Of this fact he is confessedly conscious in his introduction .

		He has '' kept a steady eye on the religious par - ticulars '' ; he admits the '' religious trend '' of his work ; but at the same time he has made it his '' duty to hear the testimony of dissent - ing and infidel authors . ''

		He apologizes for quoting so frequently
H. H. Bancroft	PERSON	and
W. H. Prescott	PERSON	, '' two authors whose religious ideas are either extremely vague or absolutely null when not inimical to Christianity . ''

		Quite naturally the author 's conclusions on a majority of the questions concerning primi - tive days are based upon the Scriptures .

		For instance , after examining the opinions of a multitude of scientists as to the probable time of the appearance of man on the earth , and summing up their widely divergent opinions , the author refuses to steer his `` exploration bark '' by their figures , and decides '' for pru - dence to seek safety in the harbor opened to us by that venerable book , '' etc. .

		Similar dis - crepancies existing among Bible students upon this point he easily disposes of by the state - ment that if we knew more about the Scrip - tures we could the better explain them .

		Aside from the criticism that the work is more of a Middle Age church disquisition than a modern historical essay , one must note the difficulty that always attends such obsolete methods the impossibility of rendering by them a verdict upon any mooted question .

		The mind is lost in uncertainty between the legendary and the authentic .

		Only when resting upon Scriptural ground does the author venture beyond the highly probable .

		In general , he rarely states a fixed opinion .

		Thus , of the texts of the Scriptures he finds that '' which one is right and which wrong will most likely ever remain a matter of dispute '' ; the time and circumstances of the disappear - ance of the so-called Mound Builders are '' involved in as deep mystery as those of their first appearance '' ; while concerning the sup - posed evidences of the Norsemen in
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts , `` explanation strictly historical is now impossible . ''

		On the other hand , it should be said that no previous work has disclosed to the general reader so many disquisitions on the possible Christianization of the Western world before
Columbus	LOCATION	, nor made so full a compilation of the many opinions on this vexed question .

		The volumes will be read with interest even by those who lament that the author did not con - fine himself to a narrower field and a less pre - judged attitude .

		Mention should be made of the several charts accompanying the descrip - tive matter .

		In closing , the author announces a similar work upon the spread of Christianity in
America	LOCATION	after
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		Two BOOKS ox BANKING .

		* The compiler of a history of banking in the
United States	LOCATION	is confronted at the outset by a difficulty inherent in the material with which he has to deal .

		Should the treatment be chro - nological ?

		or should the subject-matter be divided into histories of banking in each of the
States	LOCATION	, with a separate section for banks chartered by the Federal government ?

		The latter plan is the one followed by Mr.
Knox	PERSON	in the work before us .

		This plan facilitates the tabulation and orderly arrangement of the vast array of details which defy all attempts at condensation ; but on the other hand it makes the coordination of the material a prac - tical impossibility and precludes the compre - hensive view that is essential to complete understanding .

		The aim of the author was to gather all the information possible '' upon every phase of banking in every State of the
Union	LOCATION	. ''

		This work , left unfinished at his death in
1892	DATE	, has now been revised and brought up to date under the editorship of Mr.
Bradford Rhodes	PERSON	and Mr.
Youngman	PERSON	of the '' Bankers ' Magazine , '' with the assistance of '' a corps of financial writers '' who have furnished sketches of banking history in the several States .

		The result is a stout octavo volume of eight hundred and eighty closely printed pages , which , although it contains much information not elsewhere accessible , is not so much a connected history as a collection of material for one .

		To a certain extent the book has the advantage of being the work of a banker of training and ripe experience , who had , moreover , during his long service as Comptroller of the Currency , exceptional op - portunities for familiarizing himself with the varied details of his subject ; nevertheless , it * A HISTORY OF BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES .

		14 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, is on the whole disappointing .

		The desire of the editors -LRB- it is impossible to determine the extent of Mr.
Knox	PERSON	's authorship -RRB- to chronicle the facts without bias may be assumed to be the reason why all statement of basic princi - ples and explanation of events by reference thereto is , as far as may be , omitted .

		This is somewhat like the play of '' Hamlet '' with Hamlet left out .

		Strange as it may seem , the principles of sound banking have never been well under - stood in the
United States	LOCATION	, even by bankers themselves .

		As a consequence there has been nothing in the nature of progressive develop - ment with gradual addition of desirable fea - tures and elimination of defective ones .

		Instead , we have but a sorry record of the practical trial of almost every conceivable theory in regard to banking and credit .

		No other country has been the field for such a variety of foolish legislation upon the subject .

		Good banking systems in some of the States and bad systems in other States have existed side by side , yet seemingly with little or no comprehension , on the part of bankers , legisla - tors , or the public generally , of what consti - tuted the vital difference between them .

		At no time has a thoroughly sound , well-considered , and comprehensive system , adapted in all respects to the needs of the country , been in operation .

		The
National Banking Law	ORGANIZATION	brought order out of the chaos which preceded its en - actment , and has many excellent features , yet it is far from creating an ideal system .

		Its very success in protecting the note-holder from loss is responsible for the prevalence of erro - neous ideas in regard to the true character of the note-issuing function .

		This function has always been one of the chief stumbling-blocks in the way of an understanding of banking principles .

		Ignorance of these principles led to the enactment of laws in some of the
States	LOCATION	, of which unscrupulous men were quick to take advantage , and '' wildcat banks '' and '' stump - tail currency '' were the logical sequence .

		Even in the States in which the note issues were on a sound basis , the volume in circula - tion was regulated more by accident as , for example in
New England	LOCATION	, through the develop - ment of the
Suffolk Bank	ORGANIZATION	redemption system than as the result of a clear conception of the governing principle .

		This principle , stated briefly , is that no bank should pay out over its counter other bank notes than its own , and that provision should be made for daily redemption in all the commercial centres .

		In this way only can true '' elasticity '' be secured and the volume of the currency be automatic - ally adjusted to the needs of the community .

		In a book more than half of which is made up of articles by some twenty-seven different authors , consistent exposition in the light of any one view of what is the true explanation of the occurrences described , is not to be ex - pected ; and it is not surprising , therefore , to find effects attributed to entirely different causes , as on page 458 , where one author thinks the panic of
1857	DATE	was due to the low tariff then in force ; while another writer , on page 512 , expresses the opinion that inflation of the currency was the cause .

		Such differ - ences of opinion are perhaps inevitable in a work by so many hands .

		The editors , how - ever , must be held responsible for not elimi - nating , so far as possible , the jargon of '' the street '' and adopting a scientific terminology in its place .

		To speak of '' money , '' when '' free loanable capital '' is the correct phrase , may be sufficiently intelligible to the man who borrows or the banker who lends the capital ; but the use of such language in a history is in the highest degree misleading .

		What wonder is it that when people are informed that '' money is scarce '' they should jump to the conclusion that the volume of the circulating medium is inadequate ?

		Yet the simple truth is that it is not money but loanable capital that has become scarce , because the free cap - ital of the country or the locality which free capital may consist either of money or credit is in use owing to increased business activity , or is locked up through apprehension on the part of its owners .

		It is true that money and capital and credit are , under some circum - stances , interchangeable terms ; but that need not here be taken into consideration , this not being the place for extended discussion of the relation between them .

		Comment in detail upon the many topics treated in this volume would expand these remarks far beyond the limits of available space .

		As a storehouse of information , it is a welcome addition to banking literature .

		Many of the separate articles are ably written and are worthy of separate reviews .

		Much pains appears to have been taken to secure accuracy of statement .

		While there are occasional slips as , for instance , on page 192 , where it is a little surprising to read that the Metro - politan
National Bank of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	failed in the year
1888	DATE	, such mistakes are remarkably few for a work of such magnitude .

		THE DIAL , 15 The utility of the
Clearing House	ORGANIZATION	as a labor - saving and time-saving device in banking is well understood .

		Curiously enough , now although the idea of offsetting mutual demands against each other and settling them by pay - ment of the resulting balances only , is sim - plicity itself , the methods by which it is put into practice vary widely .

		Mr.
Cannon	PERSON	has performed a service which bankers will appre - ciate , in setting forth in detail , in his book on 44 Clearing Houses , '' the machinery in use for this purpose in the different cities in the
United States	LOCATION	, and also in
London	LOCATION	, in
Canada	LOCATION	, and in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The work is that of a banker thor - oughly familiar with his subject and careful in his presentment of it .

		Clearing Houses in their inception were the outgrowth of a practical necessity .

		The same consideration has led most of these institutions in the
United States	LOCATION	to assume functions other than the primary one for which they were established .

		Many have become to a greater or less degree a medium for united action on the part of their members .

		Rales regulating collection charges , rates of interest on deposits , banking hours , and other matters , have been adopted in many cities .

		The most important of the added functions is the pooling of resources in times of financial stress through the issue of
Clearing House	ORGANIZATION	loan certificates .

		This contrivance , the most ingenious which has been evolved from the banking methods in vogue in the
United States	LOCATION	, affording as it does a partial remedy for the lack of elasticity in our currency , is discussed at length by Mr.
Cannon	PERSON	.

		While pointing out the great benefit which has accrued from the resort to such cer - tificates in critical times , he omits to indicate the disadvantage which their use implies .

		There can be no doubt that the issue of loan certificates by the
New York	LOCATION	banks in
1893	DATE	relieved the acuteness of the distress then prevalent ; but it is true also that it intensified the currency famine and subjected bankers and merchants throughout the country to a heavy tax by causing an abnormally large dis - count on
New York	LOCATION	exchange .

		Alone among banks in the leading commercial centres , the
Chicago	LOCATION	banks have never made use of this device .

		There are many reasons for this ; among them , the certainty of inducing a scarcity of currency , which could not fail to bear with severity upon the great market-place for products always bought and sold for cash , has ever been a potent consideration .

		Mr.
Cannon	PERSON	very justly criticises the custom which obtains among the
Boston	LOCATION	banks of lending to each other the credit balances aris - ing from the clearing .

		In commenting upon a somewhat similar practice in
Chicago	LOCATION	, he does not appear to note the important distinction that the
Chicago	LOCATION	banks trade their balances merely as a matter of convenience and to avoid the risk of carrying large sums of money through the streets .

		The necessity of being always prepared to make cash settlements is not in the least done away with .

		Such settle - ments are liable to be insisted upon at any time , and especially in periods of stringency .

		If we fail here , what new

		And the answer comes with no uncertain voice in the new book by Mr.

		To those unfamiliar with the practical accom - plishments of the statesmen guiding the desti - nies of the English-speaking people in the antipodes , the book will be a surprise ; to all idealists and believers in human perfectibility it will be a delight ; and to evolutionists gen - erally it will be in a sense a stumbling-block .

		16 -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, happier than its opponent in rout .

		In this emergency , as Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	tells us , there arose in
New Zealand	LOCATION	a small body of men , themselves the sons of the people , but sons who had not forgotten their upbringing , who stepped into the gap .

		The
Bank of New Zealand	ORGANIZATION	, whining patriotism while it plundered rich and poor alike , was taken out of a slough of despond into which its managers had plunged it , and the country was thereby enabled to weather the financial storms which all but wrecked the sister colonies .

		This accomplished , a series of reforms was set on foot , the end of which is not yet .

		It is with these that Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	is chiefly concerned , and they are already so numerous that little more than a summary of them can be given .

		First of all , the
New Zealand	LOCATION	government , recognizing tramps , paupers , and workless laborers as symptoms of a disease infecting the body politic , was wise enough to regard it as only one of several symptoms , among which were also to be counted millionaires when made by turning over to private individuals any of the powers of government for the sake of private gain .

		The system of taxation was therefore reversed .

		The tax which bore most heavily on the improvements of land , and so on enterprise and thrift , was taken off , and the burden thrown on vacant land .

		If the holdings were large , the tax was proportion - ately larger ; if owned by an absentee , larger still ; and the right to purchase any given estate at a ten per centum advance on the valuation given in for purposes of taxation was legalized a measure which has given relief to scores of
New Zealand	LOCATION	families by enabling them to leave the overcrowded cities .

		Leases in perpetuity , with occupancy as an essential , make it impossible for the land to return again into the hands of the few . ''

		No man now dreams , '' an eminent
New Zealander	LOCATION	is quoted as saying , '' of founding a great landed estate in
New Zealand	LOCATION	. ''

		In the public works , beginning with road - making and extending thence to bridge-build - ing and even to the erection of public edifices , it has been found possible by the rulers of these islands to dispense altogether with the services of the middleman , to give the work directly to the workmen , and to give it in such a way that the weaker and less efficient among the workmen are fully secured in their chances of earning such a living as they are capable of earning .

		Recognizing that in trades unions the only efficient ally of the
State	ORGANIZATION	against the greed of employers is to be found , the one bulwark against the wholesale manufacture of men of broken wills and hopeless futures , the govern - ment set about restraining the power of both employers and employees for ill , passing a com - pulsory arbitration law which at a single move made strikes and the attendant abuses of public rights impossible , but limiting its beneficence to members of trades unions alone .

		A strike is not legally impossible in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, but a strike by organized labor the only form of strike which has proved effective is impos - sible .

		So a lockout by employers , singly or in combination , is not legally impossible , but may take place only when their employees have failed to join themselves to some labor organi - zation .

		It is significant that both sides not only welcome this innovation upon what some economists style natural rights , but refuse to avail themselves of the recommendation of the court below , the powers of which are limited to conciliation , and carry their cases to the point where a compulsory decree of the court of last resort ends the litigation by final adjudication .

		The railroads , prime cause of many great fortunes through partiality and private con - tract elsewhere , already belonged to the state in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, yet had been administered by a board remote from the popular will .

		The management was placed directly in the govern - ment , which is fully amenable to the will of the people as expressed at the polls .

		As a re - sult , the rates are fixed regardless of the wealth of the shipper or the value and quantities of his shipments , and the poor farmer and the rich manufacturer have exact equality in get - ting their wares to market .

		A single policy is declared that of cheaper rates .

		The government itself , without the interven - tion of a banker , advances money on lands for purposes of the improvement thereof , and the mortgage shark has disappeared with the rack renter .

		Not only this , but the government finds a market in
London	LOCATION	for the products of
New Zealand	LOCATION	industry , and advances money on con - signments , as of agricultural products , in its hands and inspected .

		The wild dream of the
Western and Southern	ORGANIZATION	populist , which would have had the American government issue de - bentures based upon wheat and other grain in governmental warehouses to the farmer , is in
New Zealand	LOCATION	an accomplished fact .

		THE DIAL 17 week , the moneys for this purpose being secured by a progressive income tax .

		All these things have been '' made to pay , '' as Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	is at pains to prove .

		Within the short time they have been operative they have been profitable to the country , and taxa - tion has decreased .

		It is not pretended that all abuses have been rectified .

		A highly pro- tective tariff still exists , for example ; but there is a perfect recognition on the part of the government that the effect of such a meas - ure is to enrich the rich and deplete the purses of the poor , and compensating taxation is ar - ranged for in view of that fact .

		Nor is the country standing still .

		The pro- gramme of the future contains such items as state fire insurance ; zone rates on railroads ; nationalized steamship lines , mines , and land ; in expensive law courts ; state banking ; and many more things of the sort , all of which seem to grow naturally out of existing conditions .

		As will be seen , the book is of the greatest interest to all students of existing social con - ditions .

		It is written in Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's simplest and best manner , and is , within certain limits , convincing .

		Yet there is too little stress laid on the fact that only ten years have elapsed since the beginning of these reforms was made a mere second of time in sociology as in geology ; that the
New Zealand	LOCATION	statesman is as exceptional in training and ambitions as in achievements ; that '' fraternalism , '' however different initially from '' paternalism , '' still spells much the same thing ; and that the pro- posed Australasian confederation places an entirely new aspect on the whole case .

		The author occasionally pushes bis view to a point that is self-destructive .

		Thus , he says : '' If it is the methodic cardinal proposition of the science of to-day that we have to explain every condition as the causally determined development out of a pre - ceding one , this excludes the appearance of any condition , event , action , or personality , which is not explicable out of tbe factors of the preceding conditions and according to tbe laws of genesis in general '' -LRB- page 9 -RRB- .

		This assertion leaves no standing-ground for human thought as a free , self - directed process .

		All mental activity sinks to a series of causal events , each series on the same foot - ing as every other series .

		The earth-worm leaves a shiny trail on the flag it traverses .

		The direction it pursues has no significance , has no rational basis .

		Tbe movement , at its highest and its lowest expression , is merely an obscure fact with no quality in the realm of truth . ''

		The Religion of a Gentleman '' the religion of a man is admirable in purpose and in execu - tion .

		Tbe author is possessed of strong spiritual susceptibilities , ruddy life , and quick intellect .

		His aim is to unite these human endowments in one coherent self-sustaining whole .

		The book will be helpful to all who are struggling for such a recon - ciliation , and find themselves embarrassed by ob - trusive irrational elements in religion .

		With sound common-sense , tbe author grasps at once tbe inner substance of faith . ''

		Tbe Christian Conception of Holiness '' is an effort to unite Christian doctrine and evolution in one harmonious conception .

		The intermediate thought by which this is done is '' the gospel of creation , '' the development of a higher form of spiritual life . ''

		God is a being whose every thought is love . '' ''

		Creation is one great unselfish thought , the bringing into being of creatures who can know the happiness which God himself knows . ''

		The author has a vigorous hold upon his subject , and scatters light freely along the discussion .

		One who gladly accepts this general line of reconciliation will still be inclined to go farther , or less far , in the details of presentation , according to the degree in which he has worked out similar lines of inquiry .

		It is a bold region , full of various and captivating views .

		The manner of thought and expression is so isolated as to detract somewhat from the popular value of the discussion . ''

		Tbe Soul of a Christian '' is a book quite of its own order , and well deserves attention .

		The writer states bis object in his first sentence in this wise : '' It is the purpose of this essay to describe the Christian life , as far as possible , in tbe terms , and with the methods , of psychology . ''

		The method pursued is discursive .

		The chapters have no very close connection , and the discussion in each is free .

		It is a book that offers itself to a piece - meal perusal , and rewards it by many flashes of light .

		It can not fail to help us to a better under - standing of the connection of nervous and spiritual phenomena .

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, The fourteen chapters on '' The Doctrines of Grace , '' though not offered as sermons , have the proportion and independence of pulpit discourses .

		They are characterized by a warmth of feeling , quickness of intellect , and common-sense which should make them acceptable not only within but beyond the circle of assent to the doctrines involved in them .

		`` The Riddle of the Universe '' seems to be a misnomer as a title , for the author makes no riddle whatever of the world , denying most of that which others regard as mysterious .

		Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	has been from the beginning , and still remains , a very flat-footed empiricist .

		Mental phenomena with him are simply a phase of physical phenomena .

		Rarely is a man so destitute of all the instruments and insights of spiritual knowledge as Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	.

		If one with no better furniture of powers were to give himself to science , he would be regarded simply as a charlatan .

		The Professor has this merit : he is no way afraid of his own conclusions , and puts them unreservedly in lan - guage appropriate to them , without the disguise of a phraseology that belongs to a higher philosophy .

		The book is a loose statement of opinions , his own and others , on a variety of spiritual and quasi - spiritual themes .

		`` Whence and Whither '' is , like the previous volume , an effort to answer great questions out of meagre resources .

		Empirical monism is largely logomachy .

		It regards very diverse relations as alike because it has applied to them similar lan - guage .

		Its explanations are verbal , not real .

		At bottom , it is most utterly unempirical , since a spiritual experience is wholly wanting or boldly thrust aside .

		Listen to this explanation of memory , and depart being fed : `` Memory is nothing but the psychical aspect of the preservation of physio - logical form .

		Some sense-impression or its reaction has left a trace which in the general metabolism preserves its form , for every particle discarded is replaced in the very same mode of grouping by another particle of the same kind , so that the structure remains the same in spite of the change of the material , and possesses the capability of producing the same kind of feeling '' -LRB- page 20 -RRB- .

		In noticing a book , it may be one 's duty to give some intimation of what persons would probably be pleased with it .

		We have no more convenient phrase at hand than that of Lincoln : Those who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they will like .

		Some notable A trul y noble P iece of bibliographical bibliographical work is the '' Catalogue of the
Dante	ORGANIZATION	work on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Collection '' presented by Professor
Willard Fiske	PERSON	to the
Cornell University Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		This catalogue , the work of Mr.
Theodore Wesley Koch	PERSON	, is now complete in two volumes containing an aggregate of over six hundred large double - columned pages .

		A first part , covering ''
Dante	PERSON	's Works , '' was issued over two years ago ; the remain - ing section -LRB- which is five or six times the larger of the two -RRB- , is a bibliography of `` Works on Dante , '' and has just now appeared .

		It is a work of amazing industry , including references to a great mass of fugitive material , and even to critical reviews of the more important modern works .

		The complete cata - logue includes more titles than have ever before been brought together in any work of Dante bibli - ography .

		Not the least interesting feature of this work is the introductory chapter written by Pro- fessor
Fiske	PERSON	, in which he tells how the collection was brought together , and makes some extremely interesting statements by way of comparison be - tween
Dante	PERSON	and the other world-poets .

		It seems that as regards editions , translations , and commen - taries ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	occupies a higher place than Homer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		His fama mondiale has resulted in more than seventy distinct translations into English , French , German , Spanish , Dutch , Greek , and Latin , with perhaps a dozen more into other languages and dialects .

		In this comparative reckoning , Homer has about fifty versions , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	hardly more than thirty .

		During the present century alone , there have been about four hundred and forty Italian editions of the '' Divine Comedy . ''

		The
Cornell Dinte Collection	ORGANIZATION	now num - bers seven thousand bound volumes , besides other material , and more than twenty-five thousand cards are needed for its catalogue .

		These facts we take from Mr.
Koch	PERSON	's pamphlet on `` The Growth and Im - portance of the
Cornell Dante Collection	ORGANIZATION	, '' published simultaneously with the '' Catalogue . ''

		Another pamphlet by Mr.
Koch	PERSON	, also just published , is a hand-list of the framed portraits and other
Dante	ORGANIZATION	pictures in the same collection .

		There is a thor - oughness about the way in which all this work has been done that commands our admiration , and Cor - nell

		A complete change of style is to be noted in Mr.

Franklin	PERSON	, a certain lightness of touch and thorough appreciation of the real homely humor with which

		The hero of the story is a little English boy , and his tramping is done in his native island .

		It is interesting to see how like the most conventional of human beings this wan - dering lad was bred .

		He learned his lessons with the same sorrow and forced perseverance which most of us are called upon to pay as the price of education ; his father and mother loved him quite as much and expressed it quite as unsuccessfully as other parents , and his smiles and tears were no more common and no further apart than those of the most respectable urchin that ever hated the taste and feeling of soap .

		The pictures are quite as realistic as the text , bat far less artistic , being reproduced from photographs derived from vari - us and not always congruous sources .

		The book will be most pleasant to read in the season when snow has covered the ground and mist-gray clouds the sky .

Japan	LOCATION	.

		cadio
Hearn	PERSON	has given us an inter - esting if not deeply significant study of Japanese thought and feeling .

		In the dedication -LRB- to Pay - master
Mitchell McDonald	ORGANIZATION	of the
U. S. Navy	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he says , `` Herein I have made some attempt to satisfy your wish for a few more queer stories from the Japanese ' '' ; and the purpose is one which the book fulfils .

		The stories are told with an effective direct - Tale * of a ZodfhUut .

		ness which gives the impression of artless simplicity , an impression serving to heighten the sense of reality in them .

		For those who love to have the grotesque and the fanciful made real , and who find a charm in credulous sincerity , the book will have a distinct fascination .

		There is in it no direct attempt to explain Japanese civilization ; it is a volume to be read for pleasure rather than for information , yet the reader can not help gaining from it a clearer notion of some of the elemental things in Japanese feeling and character .

		The long chapter on '' Jap - anese Female Names '' is full of suggestions of the fundamentally poetic nature of Japanese thought , and the chapter on `` Old Japanese Songs '' may well serve to give suggestions to English poets .

		The strange iterations , the naive baldness , have an air of originality that is strikingly effective .

		The book ends with a group of studies and stories writ - ten by Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	himself , having much of the same misty and dreamy character of those he merely reproduces .

		Mechanically the book is very at - tractive .

		There was a time , not very remote , when the works of the Rev.
J. G. Wood	PERSON	were the sources of popular information concerning all that was interesting and curious in the life of animals .

		In much the same vein and for the same purpose that this author wrote his '' Man and
Beast	LOCATION	, Here and Hereafter , '' Dr.
Thomas G. Gentry	PERSON	privately published his '' Life and Immortality , '' which now appears in a new edition nnder the title '' Intelligence in Plants and Animals '' -LRB-
Donbleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book contains a very extensive assortment of instances of curious and remarkable activities in plants and animals , which in the author 's opinion indicate a higher order of intelligence than that usually cred - ited to them .

		This so-called intelligence is the basis upon which the author founds his arguments , scien - tific and scriptural , for the immortality of all forms of life .

		He details his own observations and those of others very freely , but withal not very critically .

		While in the main the facts reported will be ac - cepted , the terminology employed in the argument and the conclusions reached will meet with objec - tions .

		Notwithstanding the somewhat pronounced views of the author , the book is very interesting and will be a valuable addition to the literature of animal lore .

		Some excellent photographs from nature , by Mr.
Dagmore	PERSON	, supplement the numerous illustrations .

		In `` The Poetry of the Psalms '' -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	has given us a serviceable '' Introduction to the study of the Psalms in English , as poetry . ''

		While the work contains little that is really new , yet we know of nothing quite like it in the way of a brief popular hand-book to the English Psalter .

		Dr. van Dyke dwells on the inadequacy of any translation , then proceeds to speak of the parallel - isms and the various kinds of lyrics .

Jan. 1	DATE	, `` A Garden of Simples .

		1 psalms he finds '' deep and genuine love of nature , '' '' a passionate sense of the beauty of holiness , '' '' an intense joy in God . ''

		He seems not to have used the opportunity to emphasize the contrast , which many besides
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	have observed , be - tween the poetic fervor of the King
James Psalter	PERSON	and the utterly flat , stale , and wearisome monotony of our modern hymnology , which shows too little improvement over the
Bay Psalm Book	LOCATION	.

		We hope , too , the time will soon come when it will be deemed unnecessary to show that to study the
Bible	LOCATION	as lit - erature does not injure it as '' a rule of faith and conduct . ''

		There is no good reason for not indent - ing paragraphs , the failure to do so often causing obscurity .

		Otherwise the volume is typographically beautiful .

		In the old days , Mrs.
Martha Bocke'e Flint	PERSON	reminds us , it used to be the custom to administer tea made from the burrs of the
Virginia	LOCATION	stickseed -LRB- echinospermum
Virginicum	PERSON	-RCB- for otherwise incorrigible cases of forgetful ness .

		Her whole book serves the same purpose , for no one can fail to retain such impres - sions as he gains from even glancing at the old - fashioned binding and paper label of '' A Garden of Simples '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is such a book as
Jeffery	PERSON	taught us to love , filled with all the delicate spirituality which Nature wears when seen with loving eyes , and imbued throughout with the charm of an elder day .

		The interests are often confes - sedly literary , as in the chapters on '' A Posy from Spenser , '' or the '' Flowers of Chaucer 's Poems . ''

		From that they wander to delicately material things , such as honey , most poetic of human aliments , or '' The Secrets of a Salad , '' no light topic to those who know .

		The history of
America	LOCATION	is not to be neglected in so eclectic a work , as little essays on '' Liberty Tea '' and '' Indian Plant Names '' attest .

		We can hardly imagine a pleas - anter gift to a charming woman , nor a more charming woman than she to whom such a book makes its full appeal .

		A recent volume in the '' Leaders in Science '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is Mr.
P. Chalmers Mitchell	PERSON	's life of the great English evolutionist and agnostic ,
Thomas H. Huxley	PERSON	.

		The perspective in which the author views his subject enables him to present a compre - hensive and well proportioned account of the life of this leader of the modern school of biologists .

		The author is himself an investigator of some note , and he renders a popular account of
Huxley	LOCATION	's most important contributions to the sciences of vertebrate and invertebrate anatomy , and of palaeontology , as well as to the development hypothesis .

		With equal clearness and fulness he relates Huxley 's public services , and defines his position as the opponent of materialism and the exponent of agnosticism .

		His attitude on theological questions , as well as his ethical ideals , are clearly stated .

		The book does not aim to be an intimate biography .

		It is a sym - Huxley as a leader in Science .

		pathetic but unbiased and just appreciation of
Huxley	LOCATION	's life and work , in concise form ; and it is a worthy compeer of the other books of the series to which it belongs .

		Recently the lines of Mr.
Rudyard Ki	PERSON	P lin g 8eem n < > t to have fallen in pleasant places .

		Mr.
W. J. Peddi	PERSON	- cord writes , and publishes at his own expense , '' Rudyard Reviewed , '' seemingly actuated by Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's dislike of
America	LOCATION	and Americans .

		At least , the critic does not attack the poet and trav - eller on aesthetic grounds in the ordinary accepta - tion of the term , but rather because the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indian did not see in
America	LOCATION	all that her more devoted children would have him see .

		We think Mr.
Peddicord	PERSON	has wasted both time and energy , and his residence in
Oregon	LOCATION	we take to be an en - couraging sign that regions nearer the East are largely indifferent to the expressed prejudices of a young man however distinguished .

		Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	takes stronger ground in her '' Patriotism or Self-Advertisement '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , devoted to the excoriation , as a whole and in all of its parts , of that jingle so widely known as '' An Absent-Minded Beggar . ''

		The punishment doubtless fits the crime ; but it makes us feel a little sorry for the criminal , nevertheless .

		The charm of a pleasing personality tlea ^ ffancie , .

		rUQS thl > OU g h the b ef Copters of Mrs.
Alice Dew-Smith	PERSON	's '' Diary of a Dreamer '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , and gives a color of reality to what might otherwise be but '' trifles light as air . ''

		With a bright abandon to the mood of the moment , the author tells us her experiences with tortoises and cats , with her husband 's dictionaries and writing-desk , and with the problems that con - front one in building a house and furnishing it .

		The themes are often inconsequential and the expe - riences not particularly dramatic , but they furnish occasion for much vivacious comment upon the every-day affairs of life .

		The book is to be read in moments of relaxation when the reader is willing to be entertained without any stirring appeal to the imagination .

		Any single chapter of the forty-five can be read in ten minutes , and each is interesting in itself apart from the others , and leaves its distinct impression .

		On the other hand , the dream atmos - phere is not always compelling , and at times leaves one with the feeling that we have when over the breakfast-table a friend tells us a fantastic sleep experience of the
night	TIME	.

		The third volume in the series en - titled '' Nature 's Miracles '' -LRB-
Fords	ORGANIZATION	,
Howard & Hulbert	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the continua - tion of Professor
Elisha Gray	PERSON	's popular account of modern science , devoted particularly to the subjects of electricity and magnetism .

		Professor Gray is of course thoroughly at home in this field , and his account is a most interesting and instructive one , the story of wireless telegraphy , and the results of A new volume of '' Nature 's Mir octet . ''

		Each recurring Holiday season has Views of the o f j ate b roa orht with it some unique Grand Canon ... , .

		\ specimen of book-manufacturing in - genuity from the press of Mr.
Frank S. Thayer	PERSON	, of
Denver	LOCATION	.

		The series began , as we remember , with a collection of photographic views of stuffed wild animals in their native lairs , the negatives for which , we were given to understand , had been secured at great peril and through years of patient waiting by a mighty hunter of the region who had been per - suaded or bribed to substitute a camera for his rifle in furtherance of the enterprise .

		This season Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's contribution is an album of fifteen photo - graphic reproductions in color , collectively entitled '' Glimpses of the Grand Cafion of the
Colorado	LOCATION	, '' which we have inspected with caution .

		The plates are showy and effective , and are neatly mounted on ash-colored paper , and encased in flexible dec - orated covers .

		The pictures selected are represen - tative , and convey a good idea of the remarkable scenery of the region .

		A vein of delicate sentiment , a grace - ful and refined fancy , and the ability to realize vividly for the reader bits of landscape with their proper atmosphere , make Miss
Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	's '' Later Love Letters of a Musician '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- a book to be enjoyed for its artistic charm .

		The letters , of which there are nearly thirty , each preceded by an appropriate phrase of music set alone on the page , are largely the expression of artistic responsiveness to the moods of nature or to some of the suggestive expe - riences of a musician 's life .

		The book is very art - istically printed , and is one to be enjoyed for more than the first reading , a thing that can not be said of many a more pretentious volume .

		Love Letter * of a musician .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Transition Period '' is a new volume in the '' Periods of European Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , edited by Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		It is the work of Mr.
G. Gregory Smith	PERSON	, and fills the gap between Mr.
Snell	PERSON	's '' Fourteenth Century '' and the editor 's forthcoming discussion of '' The Earlier Renaissance . ''

		The author has brought much learning and no little animation to his somewhat thankless task of dealing with the most barren period of modern literature , a period which in - cludes Villon and
Malory	PERSON	, the Scotch group of poets , the ''
Morgante Maggiore	PERSON	, '' the '' Coplas '' of Manrique , the '' Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles , '' '' Till Eulenspiegel , '' the '' Imitation , '' the ballads , and the beginnings of the drama in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Estelle M. Kuril	PERSON	's little book on Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	forms a welcome and pictorially attractive number in the `` Riverside Art Series '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is apparently meant to be in some sort a text-book , or an elementary manual for the teacher , and hence its style is simple and its information mainly rudimentary .

		There is an introductory outline of
Reynolds	PERSON	's life , together with some general appreciation of his work ; but the text is largely a running com - mentary on the pictures , of which there is about one to each chapter , making seventeen in all .

		These are well chosen and handsomely reproduced .

		Fifty pages of introduction , a hundred pages of notes , and three hundred pages of extracts are , roughly speak - ing , the contents of the volume of '' Selections from the Poetry of Lord Byron '' which Dr.
Frederick I. Car	PERSON	- penter has prepared for the series of '' English Read - ings '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is one of the best books of the admirable series in which it appears , and was rather more needed than any of the others .

		No one to-day wants the whole of
Byron	PERSON	, and a book which will help us to keep in mind the best of him does a real service to literature .

		The estimate made by the editor is sympathetic , yet carefully dis - criminating , and the judgments expressed are in the main temperate and sound .

		With the appearance of Volume XVIII .

		-LRB- containing the remainder of the short stories -RRB- the '' Shenandoah '' edition of the novels and stories of Mr.
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	which has been in course of publication by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons during the past year , reaches temporary completion .

		Like all of Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's well-known subscription sets , the mechanical form of the '' Shenandoah '' edition could hardly be improved upon .

		Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	may well be envied the distinction conferred upon him by his publishers , for it is not often that an author has the satisfaction of seeing his work presented in so beautiful a form .

		The set should take a prominent place on the shelves of every admirer of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's peculiar and inimitable genius .

		`` The Beginnings of English Literature , '' by Mr.
Charlton M. Lewis	PERSON	, is a small volume published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' Its purpose is to give to those who do not , for the present at least , require an intimate acquaintance with Old and Middle English authors , such a knowledge of their characteristics and historical relations as may serve for an introduction to the study of the Elizabethan and later periods . ''

		It offers a com - promise between the very elementary books and those which are made unduly repellant by being crammed with minor names and facts .

		It includes many extracts , and is altogether a readable and useful little book .

		Professor
J. Scott Clark	PERSON	's `` Study of English and American Poets '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a companion volume to the author 's '' Study of English Prose Writers , '' pub - lished over two years ago .

		The method is the same in both volumes .

		Each author treated is given a biog - raphy , a page or two of references to critical apprecia - tions , and something like thirty or forty pages of clas - sified excerpts from the best critics , together with illustrative passages from the poet himself .

		Twenty poets are considered altogether , six of them being Americans .

		We have great confidence in the value of this method of studying literature , and believe that teachers will find these volumes by Professor
Clark	PERSON	a useful adjunct to their work .

		Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's erstwhile `` Primer , '' later known by the simpler title of '' English Literature , '' has just made a third appearance , with an additional chap - 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ter by the author , and two supplementary chapters on American literature by Mr.
George Rice Carpenter	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Praise has long since been exhausted in dealiug with this little book , which , considering its lim - ited scope , is as good as could well be imagined .

		Speak - ing of Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's added chapter , however , we are bound to take exception to the statement that
Morris	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	have remained '' out of sympathy with modern life . ''

		The poets of '' Jenny '' and '' Poems by the Way '' and '' Songs before Sunrise '' need no defence against such a charge , and it is sur - prising indeed that Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	should have expressed such an opinion of them .

		Having exhausted the bibliographical possibilities of the longer novels of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	in a volume issued some two or three years ago , Mr.
F. G. Kitton	PERSON	has turned his attention to the '' minor writings , '' and the results of his work in this field are contained in the latest volume of the '' Book-Lover 's Library '' -LRB-
A. C. Armstrong & Son	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The amount of labor necessary to identify the numerous periodical contributions and miscellaneous papers of the novelist can not easily be estimated , but Mr.
Kitton	PERSON	's unfailing enthusiasm for his subject has prevailed over all difficulties .

		Taken together , the two volumes form as complete and exact a bibliographical record of the literary productions of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	as could be desired .

		51 THE NOVEL AND THE PLAY .

		The most aggravating of all critics is the critic who asserts and gives no reasons .

		A writer in a recent number of THE DIAL tells ns that the novel is a finer art-form than the play , and practically the only reason he offers to back his opinion is that the first form is contemporary and the second archaic .

		Archaic !

		What great art has not been archaic at the time of its production ?

		Gray remarks , in one of his letters , that the language of poetry is never the language of the age or of common life .

		Shake - speare 's speech was undoubtedly strange to the Elizabethans .

		The well-Ian guaged
Daniel	PERSON	'' was the scholarly type of that day , and
Daniel	PERSON	is as modern as Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	.

		The same is true of thought and character .

		If either is great , it can not possibly conform to accepted conventions .

		What can we suppose that even the Athenians made of the Prometheus or the Agamemnon or the Persian ghost of .

		ZEschylus ?

		As we can see in
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, these were rather musty fables to them .

		The dis - play of the Panathenaic festival , or the riot of the Eleusinian mysteries , were much more to their minds .


Alleyne	PERSON	, the theatrical manager of Shake - speare 's time , has left it on record that he made the greater part of his fortune by showing bears .

		The Spaniards tolerated
Calderon	PERSON	as an appanage of the Inquisition , but their real joy was in the burning of heretics .

		The auto da fe was doubtless to them a sweet contemporary thing .

		Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	, by the expenditure of infinite labor , built up a theatre in
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		They forced great tragedy and comedy , the use of verse and the right reading of it , down the German throat .

		But was their patient grateful to them ?

		Not a bit Goethe was forced to resign the directorship of the theatre by a performing dog .

		I hope the writer referred to will pardon me if I offer him some reasons why the novel might be a finer art than the play .

		In the first place , it has a larger canvas .

		The average novel has from five to ten times more words in it than the average play .

		If there is anything in big battalions , Xerxes ought always to overwhelm
Leonidas	PERSON	.

		In the second place , the novel , though a hybrid , may possibly in - herit the qualities of its various ancestors .

		It may have the pure emotional gush of the lyric , the orb - icular sweep of the epic , the intensity of the drama .

		In the third place , it is gifted with omniscience , a power which the epic shares with it , but which is denied to other art forms .

		In the fourth place , it can perform the offices of the scene-painter , the actor , the gas-man , the usher in the body of the theatre , and the critic in the next day 's print .

		And lastly , it requires no such attention on the part of the reader as does the more abstract form of the play , which , especially if written in verse , is the most concentrated work of the human mind .

		In reading a novel , we sit at feast like a Persian King , and have one servant to cut our food , another to put it in our mouths , and a third to work our jaws for us .

		I am not mocking .

		These advantages the novel possesses , and they in great part account for its popularity .

		But for the final result of greatness they are fallacious and break down .

		The immense expenditure of words in a novel is a solution of con - tinuity and defeats the purpose of an art-work to grasp and body forth a definite conception .

		Each 34 THE DIAL -LSB- Jan , 16 , tidal wave of words washes out the record of its predecessor .

		And the mixture of forms in the novel is an element of weakness rather than of strength .

		An olla podrida is neither as good for the digestion nor as tempting to the palate as a course dinner where the flavor of every dish is con - served .

		And the all-embracing view of the novelist carries with it a quality of vagueness , so much so that the epistolary and biographical forms of the novel , in which this power is resigned , are perhaps the most vivid and intense .

		And the combination of services which the novelist offers to perform for us tends to distraction ; it is ruinous to total effect .

		The actors get in the way of the plot , the scene - painting interferes with the dialogue , and the lyrical or didactic effusions of the author in person spoil the illusion .

		Most serious of all , the ease with which a novel can be read weakens the mind .

		A good play , though so much shorter than a novel , demands a far greater amount of attention , and so tends to fasten itself upon the brain .

		In general , the question between the play and the novel is a question of law or liberty , discipline or license .

		I like to image the play as a troop of Spanish cdbelleros or conquestadores , mounted on the steeds of inspiration , armored with verse , armed with thought , and moving in instinctive obedience to one will ; while the novel is a vast , lawless , dis - organized mass of Mexican or Inca barbarians , howling and hurling itself on the compact body of iron-clad men .

		The mob may submerge the few for a time , but it must eventually be beaten back and reduced to submission and slavery .

		We learn from the article already cited that the play tends to base itself on the novel .

		Certainly .

		It has always done so .

		The plays of the Greek tragedians were based on the cyclic poems which were the novels of antiquity , and which have per - ished .

		Shakespeare and his circle based their art on Italian novella , many of which were as good fiction as is written to-day .

		The order of life is for the soul to ascend from the body .

		The instinct of mankind is not satisfied until the pure kernel of an art-work is disengaged from its mixed and impure mass of wrappings and enfoldments .

		Though the writer I am considering regards the novel as a finer art-form than the play , he does not assert that his greatest typical novelist is superior to the typical dramatist .

		He only insists on a cer - tain equality between the two .

		He is willing to concede that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was a respectable sort of a person who did good in his day , though he is hardly up to our modern standards of democratic art .

		Personally , I feel disposed to light a hecatomb of expiation to Shakespeare for bringing him , even for defense , into competition with
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		But this is a wrong feeling .

		Shakespeare must stand his trial like any other author .

		Every generation sum - mons the favorites of the past to the bar of its opinion , questions them as to their birth and con - dition and present means of livelihood , and judges and sentences them after its own sweet will , judging itself at the same operation .

		And this is necessary and right .

		Literature in
Mortmain	LOCATION	, literature held in the dead hand , is as dangerous as literature of new-born bounce and bluster .

		So let us on to the comparison .

		Those who have done me the honor to read my notes on literature published in THE DIAL will not suspect me of holding a brief for style .

		Not that I do not in my own mind worship style , but I hold it a result , not a means .

		I believe it follows the accumulation of thoughts , and the kindling concep - tion of character .

		But when it so arrives , it is the final stamp of greatness .

		Now , as the previous writer practically admits , there is in this respect no possible parallel between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Bal - zac .

		Balzac in style is plebeian , is home-made , is humdrum .

		In a nation of graceful writers , he is the dancing bear of prose .

		Shakespeare , with a great many people , is mainly and above all the master , the magician of words .

		He may be slightly less clear and faultless than the Greeks , but he is infinitely more gorgeous in color and varied in carving , and there is more of him that is good than there is of all the Greek poets put together .

		This matter of wealth of expression in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is very little realized .

		Because each of our greater English poets has some distinctive quality of his own , we are apt to think of them as inferior indeed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but still to some extent comparable .

		As far as expression is con - cerned , they could almost all of them be quarried out of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The peak of
Teneriffe	ORGANIZATION	is a striking enough object in its isolation , but transport it to the Andes or the
Himalayas	LOCATION	and it would sink to a mole-hill lost in the vastnesses about it .

		The matter of expression , therefore , to many people the most important of all , is settled for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	against Balzac .

		Most great poets are philosophers as well .

		They justify the ways of God to man , or defend the ways of man to God .

		Dante is the final expression of the Catholicism of the Fathers ;
Calderon	PERSON	of the Catholicism of the Inquisition ; Milton of
Calvin	PERSON	- ism .

		Goethe gave full literary form to the new scientific method and thought of
Bacon	LOCATION	and
Frank	PERSON	- lin .

		His philosophy is the philosophy of egotism and utility .

		It must be admitted that when we come to assess the philosophy of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, it is difficult to put one 's hand on his central thought .

		He unquestionably imbibed Pyrrhonism from
Montaigne	LOCATION	, and Pyrrhonism is not constructive .

		But he is always thinking of the mighty problems of the soul , of the destinies of humanity .

		He wan - ders around the walled chamber of the world like a mightier Hamlet stabbing the arras everywhere to find out what is beyond .

		As for Balzac , he can hardly be said to have any thought at all except the ever-pressing one to get and spend as much money as possible .

		He wrote in '' The Alchemist '' about the research into the Absolute .

		But the Absolute has mighty little to do with the book , which is mainly concerned with the physiognomy
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 35 of an old bouse and the fate of a lot of old furni - ture .

		When Balzac was well through his '' Human Comedy , '' he seemed to have felt that there was something wanting to it .

		He was like the architect who left the staircase out of his house and had to add it on the outside .

		Balzac wrote ''
Louis Lam	PERSON	- bert . ''

		An American editor of this hook has read into it marvellous and immeasurable meanings .

		Any hook can become a fetish if one gives one 's mind up to it and shuts out all other sources of information .


Wilkie Collins	PERSON	, in one of his novels , has an old butler who has made a Bible of ``
Rob	PERSON	- inson Crusoe , '' and finds in it the most amazing oracles for every event .

		To me ''
Louis Lambert	PERSON	'' seems a vague rehash of Swedenborgian or Hindoo philosophy crammed for the occasion .

		It utterly lacks the value which hard , original thinking , in whatever method to whatever end , possesses for the human mind . ''

		The Angels are white , '' says
Lambert	PERSON	, and that is about his most valuable con - tribution to vision or thought .

		On the whole , then , Balzac as a thinker is of no class whatever ; whereas
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wears the imperial purple .

		There remains the presentation of reality by the two the reproduction of the aspects of Nature and Art , and the creation of human figures .

		It may be noted that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is almost all out-of - doors ; whereas
Balzac	LOCATION	is ever confined to the rooms of mansion or cottage to the streets and alleys of towns .

		Pretty much the whole of Nature is in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, but little of the art or handiwork of man .

		Balzac has a real point of superiority in his architecture and interiors , in which he surpasses everybody .

		As for the human crowds of the two , what shall I say ?

		In making a comparison here , I can only do like the critic I have been criticising , offer assertions unbacked by reasons .

		For it is almost impossible to give reasons for the love or the affections which rise within us .

		If anyone thinks
Eugenie Grandet	PERSON	superior to
Juliet	LOCATION	, or Mudeste Mignon to
Imogen	LOCATION	; if he likes
Caesar Birrotteau	PERSON	better than
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	, and believes old Grandet a better drawn figure than Shylock , why , one can only avert one 's eyes , turn down the first crossing , and let him go his misguided way alone .

		But I think I may assert that
Balzac	LOCATION	's people are all book folk .

		They never have had cut the umbilical cord which binds them to the printed page .

		They do not stray out into real life and become our friends and loves , as do the char - acters of even lesser men than
Shakespeare Scott and Dickens	PERSON	, for instance .

		One forgets them in their multitude until one takes the book up again , when the skill , the science , the power of the author bring them back .

		And another thing may be asserted : they are all small , figurines rather than statues .

		Balzac never created one of those typical human figures that sum up a race , or resume once for all some abstract quality of life .

		Molie 're and Old
Dumas	PERSON	are tbe most Shakespearean souls of
France	LOCATION	.

		Alceste and
Tartuff	PERSON	are eternal , and D' Ai tagnan is the incarnation of the Gallic spirit He is as much the human symbol of
France	LOCATION	as
Don Quixote	PERSON	is of
Spain	LOCATION	, Hamlet of
Germany	LOCATION	, or
Robinson Crusoe of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The typical figure of
America	LOCATION	is What shall I say ?

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		A writer may be greater than his age , but , even unconsciously , he is apt to render in his work the lineaments of his time .

		It is important , then , that the age has something of splendor or greatness to give him .

		Shakespeare came at the culminating period of the young manhood of the English race .

		His age was the age of new-born liberty , of revo - lutions in thought and discovery in the world .

		It was the age that beat back the Armada .

		Balzac 's age was wearied with the excesses of the Revolution and the Napoleonic era ; it was an age of galvanized monarchy and scarecrow empire .

		It was weak and futile and corrupt .

		It was the age which fell at Sedan .

		Balzac 's gift is the modern gift , the scientific gift , the gift of observation .

		Lord
Bacon	PERSON	claimed that his method did away with the necessity of genius in philosophy , that it opened the paths of science to the average intelligence .

		The same can be said of the scientific method in literature .

		Anyone can sit down with a note book before a given quantity of life and record and report it .

		But the art so produced is open to the charge which Plato mis - takenly brought against all poetry that it is an imitation of an imitation , reality at third remove .

		Only where the poet aereates the mass of material given him from without with the inspiration which comes to him within , where he glimpses the uni - versal through the actual , do we get an art product which is valid and valuable for all time .

		Perhaps the best way to get at the value of any large art-work is to estimate the sum-total of emo - tion it produces .

		What is our final impression of
Balzac	LOCATION	's work ?

		Do we not feel , when we are done with it , as though we had wakened from an all-night debauch , with a headache and a bad taste in our mouths ?

		Do we not feel as though we had been moving through some mighty marsh clothed with fantastic vegetation , with fetid exhalations rising from it as incense to expiring suns ?

		Do we not say to ourselves , ' What is the use ? '

		T is a sick and a sordid and a sorry world .

		Let 's cut our throats . ''

		On the other hand , what is our legacy of impression from Shakespeare ?

		Is it not that we have been living in a land of sunlight and wooded shade , co - equal heirs with men of mighty ardor and women of holy flame ?

		That thunder-storms might come , indeed , and seem to wreck our world , but that everything would spring fresher from their passing ; that our minds would leap to their shock , our muscles brace with their tension , until we would feel that we were seventeen feet high and of Achil - lean form and visage , until we would want to climb to the summits of the earth and shake our fists in the face of fate ?

		Which is the mightier artist , which is tbe better gift to mankind ?

		MR.
HOWARD PYLE	PERSON	AND THE AMERICAN FARMER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In some brief comments on Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's illus - trations for the holiday volume of Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's poems , a writer in your issue of
Dec. 1	DATE	shows a fine appreciation of the artist 's strong elemental treatment of the subjects ranged for his pencil , and a correct con - ception of art values .

		Noting this breadth of view upon one side , it is surprising to find what appears to be a somewhat narrow range of sympathy upon another .

		The critic assumes , apparently , that in the '' pictorial allegory '' which forms the frontispiece of the volume in question , the artist had in mind the American farmer , and that the effect was decidedly unflattering to this worthy citizen .

		To refute this idea seems an exegesis of the obvious .

		It is , at the outset , hardly reasonable to suppose that the poem , written avowedly in com - mentary upon Millet 's picture of the same name , could refer to any American working-man , except in so far as he like any other had become a type of degraded labor .

		The Millet peasant is not even a type of the ordinary French laborer , but only of the toiler brutalized by ex - cessive and unrelieved toil .

		He is a man who has had no inlet of joy , no outlet of delight , in his labor .

		As Mr.
Markham	PERSON	himself has said , '' ' The Man With the Hoe ' is , in a large way , the type of any man who has forgotten to grow , who has forgotten that man does not live by bread alone . ''

		This overworked drudge , who will have to be born again many times to get out of the basement strata of life into the height of '' the upper chamber opening toward the sky , '' does exist amongst us .

		He sweeps our streets ; he bakes our bread ; he digs our coal ; he may even write our law briefs , or preach our sermons .

		Civilization will not be civilization till somehow he is made his best , whether by educating his grandfather in order that he , the de - scendant , may have a will to do and dare , or by edu - cating the man himself , and giving him time , like
Browning	PERSON	's hero , to get all the gain there is from hav - ing been a man .

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	, like Mr.
Markham	PERSON	, sees in the Man with the Hoe , not the American farmer , though possibly a '' farm hand , '' slaving from dawn till long past dark , might represent the type .

		He sees only the bended back that has borne the heat and burden of the day down through the ages ; he sees that the Man with the Hoe is the type of industrial oppression in all lines of labor , the man shapen -LRB- or misshapen -RRB- by the pitiless ten - dencies and injustices of our civilization .

		LIBRARY PRIVILEGES FOR RURAL DISTRICTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On the first of
January , 1901	DATE	, there occurred in the town of
Van Wert	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, county-seat of Van Wert county , an event whose significance the future alone will reveal : the dedication of
America	LOCATION	's first county library .

		Most of the cities and many of the larger towns and villages of our country have their public libraries ; it remained for this
Ohio	LOCATION	county to inaugurate a movement that may eventually bring library privileges where they are most needed ,
viz.	LOCATION	, to the rural districts .

		The library is named The
Brumback Library	ORGANIZATION	, in honor of its founder , the late
J. S. Brumback	PERSON	, a prom - inent and wealthy citizen .

		A special law made pos - sible by the
Brumback	PERSON	heirs was passed by the
Ohio	LOCATION	legislature , providing for the maintenance of the library by the county , and this was almost unanimously favored and approved by the people throughout the county concerned .

		The library building is one of the most substantial and beautiful in the country .

		It has a capacity of 100,000 volumes , represents a value of
$ 50,000	MONEY	, and under the new decennial appraisement will have an annual income of
$ 8,000	MONEY	.

		Under the stimulus already given ,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	has ex - tended its field of library work to all parts of
Hamil	PERSON	- ton county , and several other counties have been dis - cussing the advisability of imitating the example of
Van Wert	LOCATION	county .

		The movement was fully discussed and heartily endorsed at the recent annual meeting of the
Ohio Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two thoughts which were especially emphasized in the dedicatory exercises may be worth repeating here : First , we have in the bequest of a county library one of the few philanthropies that tend to benefit all the people , country as well as town .

		Our philanthropy has heretofore directed its efforts chiefly to the eleva - tion of the city or town only .

		Second , the recent census , which shows how great during the past decade has been the migration from county to city , is an appeal to American citizenship to look in the future more to the welfare and enlightenment of our great rural pop - ulation , the bone and sinew of our national life .

		TEN GREAT AUTHORS OF THE CENTURY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		One of the greatest authors of all time is
Jeremy Bentham	PERSON	.

		He is the father of Utilitarianism , and to him more than to anyone else do we owe a rational system of jurisprudence .


Bentham	PERSON	has furnished more ideas to legal writers than any other man of the century .


Arthur Schopenhauer	PERSON	is the greatest metaphysician that ever lived .

		His '' World as Will and Representa - tion '' is the best solution of the World Riddle ever offered .

		He is the father of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	in music .

		He originated a system of philosophy Pessimism .

		He was one of the greatest scholars of the century ; the only man who ever made metaphysics popular .


Auguste Comte	PERSON	was one of the greatest men that ever lived .

		He originated the science of Sociology ; and it is to his impetus that we owe the great social evolution now going on .

		His conception of Humanity is the grandest ever originated ; his conception of the destiny of man the truest .

		He knew more about Re - ligion than any man in the nineteenth century .

		He is one of the least appreciated men of his age .

		He did for Sociology what
Darwin	PERSON	did for Biology .


Charles Darwin	PERSON	's was the most argumentative mind of the century .

		He discovered the most useful law ever known to science , and he proved it to an opposing public .

		The race will remember him as one of her great men for all time .

		He revolutionized the science of Biology all science .

		It is to him that the true theory of things is possible in the twentieth century .

		What
Darwin	PERSON	did for Biology ,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	did for Psychology .

		COVENTRY
PATMORE	LOCATION	, His RELATIVES AND FRIENDS .

		* The multifarious interest of the two thick volumes containing Mr.
Basil Champneys	PERSON	's
Memoirs of Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	goes far to make up for their somewhat disproportionate size .

		The work forms a readable though rather rambling account of
Patmore	LOCATION	, his relatives , his three household '' Angels , '' his literary friends , which one may open at random with the assur - ance of finding something at least mildly inter - esting ; but we should have preferred a close - knit , comparatively concise biography , showing the figure of its hero clearly and in the due perspective though of course Mr.
Champ	PERSON	- neys has adhered to his own view of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's proportional importance .

		Outwardly
Patmore	PERSON	's career was uneventful , and its main features may be briefly sketched .

		He was not a
University	ORGANIZATION	man , and indeed the MEMOIRS AND CORRESPONDENCE OF COVENTRY PAT - MORE .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		two years he spent at the
College de France , St. Germains	ORGANIZATION	, formed the only period of his life during which he was under regular tuition .

		As a boy he showed great precocity and a marked literary bent which his father , who was at once his companion and preceptor , industri - ously fostered .

		Authors were the heroes of his boyhood , and he used to tell later of his pil - grimage at sixteen to the house of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, whose devoted admirer he then was . ''

		... After I had waited in the little parlor at least two hours the door was opened and a most pic - turesque gentleman , with hair flowing nearly or quite to his shoulders , a beautiful velvet coat and a Vandyck collar of lace about a foot deep , appeared , rubbing his hands and smiling ethereally , and saying , without a word of preface or notice of my having waited so long , 1 This is a beautiful world , Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	! '

		I was so struck by this remark that it has eclipsed all memory of what occurred during the remainder of my visit . ''

		Encouraged by his father , and fired by the appearance of the
Tennyson	PERSON	volume of
1842	DATE	,
Patmore	PERSON	launched , in
1844	DATE	, a little volume of poems which , being as full of promise as they were vulnerable , came in for both exaggerated praise and exaggerated contempt at the hand of the reviewers . ''

		The Critic '' kindly said of Patmore : '' But if nature hath forbidden him to be a poet , the sooner he finds out his incapacity the better for himself and his friends ; for it may save to society a valuable worker in some other field , while it spares to critics the irksome toil of fault-finding , to himself the pain of be - ing compelled to hear unwelcome truths , and to his friends mayhap the cost of maintaining a lank-ribbed author and a bare-footed family . ''

		``
Maga	PERSON	, '' of course , fell foul of the new '' cockney '' poet in its usual style , the reviewer ending his diatribe against the '' school '' in general , and its alleged latest exponent in par - ticular , as follows : '' This is the life into which the slime of the Keatses -LRB- sic -RRB- and Shelleys of former times has fecundated .

		The result was predicted a quarter of a century ago in this magazine nothing is so tenacious of life as the spawn of frogs the fry must become extinct in him .

		His poetry -LRB- thank Heaven -RRB- can not corrupt into any - thing worse than itself . ''

		On the other hand , as we have said ,
Pat	PERSON	- more 's initial volume was warmly praised in some of the reviews , and it was , as may now be noted , even rapturously received by a band of young men , themselves convention-breakers , who were then springing into prominence the Prae-Raphaelite Brotherhood .

		Possibly these young painters recognized a certain sim - ilarity of aim in their own productions and the verses of the new poet .

		At all events they used to carry the little volume about with them , and 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, `` to read it at every moment of leisure . ''


William Rossetti	PERSON	writes : '' We admired the poems enormously , and I daresay that in the course of a couple of years we had read every one of them through 20 or 30 times .

		Gabriel was certain to talk about them to fellow-students at the
R. A.	PERSON	, etc. , and more especially to Hunt ,
Millais	PERSON	, and
Woolner	PERSON	. ''

		It was some years later that
Patmore	PERSON	became personally known , through
Woolner	PERSON	, to the Millais-Rossetti circle , who claimed him , it seems , as the representative in poetry of their principles , and got him to write for '' The Germ , '' to the first number of which he sent a short poem , `` The Seasons , '' which was later reprinted in '' Tamerton Church Tower . ''

		Of his intercourse with the '' Brotherhood ''
Pat	PERSON	- more says : '' I was intimate with the Prse-Raphaelites when we were little more than boys together .

		They were all very simple , pure-minded , ignorant , and confident ... They could not even have printed the ' Germ ' without -LRB- pecuniary -RRB- assistance .

		I well remember
Millais	PERSON	tri - umphantly flourishing before my eyes a cheque for 150 which he got for ' The Return of the Dove to the
Ark.	LOCATION	' Once I was at a gathering of the Brethren and their friends , when
Holman	PERSON	Hunt produced forty sketches , and said that any one might have them for a pound apiece ... Hunt attracted me personally more than any of the Pra-Raphaelites .

		He was heroically simple and constant in his purpose of primarily serving religion by his art , and had a Quixotic notion that it was absolutely obligatory upon him to redress every wrong that came under his notice ...
Rossetti	PERSON	was in manners , mind , and appearance completely Italian .

		He had very little knowledge of or sympathy with En - glish literature ; and always gave me the impression of tensity rather than intensity . ''

		When twenty-two or thereabouts
Patmore	PERSON	felt for a time the unaccustomed pinch of want , he and his brother having been suddenly thrown upon their own resources through their father 's failure and subsequent flight to the Continent .

		For a time the brothers struggled on in Grub Street fashion , managing to scrape together , through translations and chance hack-work , the few indispensable shillings from twenty - five to sixteen a week .

		At one time
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	's finances were reduced to three and sixpence , which sum he seems to have recklessly spent on ices .

		This period of eclipse was ended through the kindly intervention of
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	, who procured for
Patmore	PERSON	a place in the Brit - ish Museum .

		Of
Milnes	ORGANIZATION	's first encounter with
Patmore	PERSON	a pleasant story was told by Mrs.
Procter	PERSON	, which we quote in Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's words : `` After a dinner at her house in
1846	DATE	,
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	said to her in the drawing-room , And who is your lean young friend in the frayed coat-cuffs ? ' '

		Oh , Mr.
Milnes	PERSON	, ' she replied , you would not talk in that way if you knew how clever he is and how unfortunate .

		Have you read his '' Poems '' ? '

		Milnes took them away in bis pocket , and wrote to her next morning , ' If your young friend would like a post in the Library of the British Museum , it shall be obtained for him , if only to induce you to forget what must have seemed my heartless flippancy .

		His book is the work of a true poet , and we must see that he never lacks butter for his bread . ' ''

		From the end of
1846	DATE	till the beginning of
1866	DATE	Patmore worked steadily at the Museum , a diligent but not , from the librarian 's point of view , a particularly able assistant .

		He could never , he used to say , resist the temp - tation to look into and taste the flavor of every book that passed through his hands ; and it is interesting to note that the net result of these tests was that at the end of his long term of service he reached the depressing conclusion that , of the forty miles of shelves in the Museum , forty feet would contain all the real literature of the world .

		How much of the forty miles of shelving was , in
Patmore	LOCATION	's opin - ion , devoted to conserving real rubbish we are left to conjecture .

		On his retirement in
1866	DATE	Patmore was awarded a pension -LRB- of the cu - riously precise sum of .126 , 13s .

		4d .

		a year -RRB- which he drew until his death .

		The circumstances of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's conversion to Roman Catholicism -LRB- 1864 -RRB- are not perhaps generally known , and would seem indeed to have been to some extent misrepresented , or misunderstood .

		That his formal change of creed was at least accelerated by his desire to remove the insuperable obstacle to his union with the lady who became his second wife , Mr.
Champneys	PERSON	seems to admit .

		The notion that
Patmore	PERSON	deliberately turned Catholic because he thought the lady in question -LRB- as
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		thought
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- '' well worth a Mass , '' is of course as cruel as absurd , and that anyone could have broached it bears out Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's philosophical conclusion that there is much more pure malevolence in the world than people think .

		However , the facts in the case were as follows : In
1864	DATE
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	, still outwardly of the Anglican faith , journeyed to
Rome	LOCATION	where he made the acquaintance of a
Miss Byles	PERSON	, an English convert to
Romanism	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Byles	PERSON	was a woman of cultivation and some personal charm , who , as a girl , had been a pupil of
Archdeacon	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards Cardinal -RRB-
Manning	PERSON	, whose second wife it was believed with good reason she might in time have become .

		Any such prospect was of course brought to an end when
Manning	PERSON	took orders in the Roman Church ; but his influence over
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 39 his pupil continued , and two years after his secession
Miss Byles	PERSON	, to the consternation of her friends , followed the example -LRB- and probably the counsel -RRB- of her former preceptor .

		She used to relate afterwards with some humor , when the sting of the slights once put upon her by her antipapistical friends and relatives had disappeared , how an Anglican clergyman , calling at the house shortly after her conver - sion , refused for some time to notice her at all , until , on leaving , he kindly asked her '' when she might be expected to turn Mohammedan ? ''

		Patmore , then , met
Miss Byles	LOCATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	, and it was she , we may conclude , who finally turned his footsteps , already wavering at the parting of the ways , into the path to the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		Patmore records in his religious autobiography his early impression of his future wife : '' I had never before , '' he says , '' beheld so beautiful a personality , and this beauty seemed to be the pure effluence of the Catholic Sanctity . ''

		The pair were married in
July , 1864	DATE	-LRB- a year after the death of
Pat	PERSON	- more 's first wife -RRB- , at
Bayswater	LOCATION	, Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	performing the ceremony , despite his disappointment at his fair convert 's '' sacrifice of her vocation , '' for
Miss Byles	PERSON	, it seems , had contemplated taking the veil .

		Patmore 's second wife , whose influence on his religious views and writings Mr.
Champneys	PERSON	thinks was con - siderable , died some sixteen years after her marriage , and her place was promptly filled by
Harriet Robson	PERSON	, the third '' Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' for the '' poet of nuptial love '' tolerated no long break in his facilities for the imme - diate study of his chosen theme .

		Patmore 's inbred mystical bent , and the completeness of his surrender to the primitive spirit of the old faith , are attested by his pil - grimages to Lourdes with two of his children , for whose bodily ailments he hoped for a mir - aculous cure at the shrine .

		For the partial blindness of one eye of his son
Henry	PERSON	, in par - ticular , great things were hoped ; but , alas !

		Our Lady of Lourdes proved no better than the
London	LOCATION	oculist , for the sight of the offend - ing eye was soon totally lost .

		Patmore wrote to his wife from Lourdes : '' ... We are offering our Masses for
Henry	PERSON	and our hopes of him are increased by a miracle we were lucky enough to come in for yesterday .

		A peasant girl , with the most exquisite look of innocence and gratitude , had just come from the bath entirely cured of a paralysis of three years ' standing .

		We had some talk with her and her mother as she was walking off with no touch of lameness , and the limb , which had been hitherto en - tirely insensible , restored to feeling and full strength .

		There could be no mistake about it .

		Rachel could not have acted the part . ''

		Patmore 's faith in the virtues of the holy well was as entire as that of the Catholic students cited by
Paul Bert	PERSON	, who , before presenting themselves for their examination for the '' bac - calaureat , '' piously put drops of Lourdes water into their ink-bottles , in order that they might '' pass '' with distinction ; and his faith was in no wise shaken by the failure in his son 's case of the mystic fluid as an eye-water .

		Mr.
Champneys	PERSON	's first volume contains , be - sides the story of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's life , separate chap - ters on his father , on each of his three wives , on his relations with
Tennyson	PERSON	, and concludes with three chapters of personal recollections .

		In Volume II .

		Patmore 's religious and philo - sophical opinions are rather elaborately dis - cussed in three chapters , and these are followed by the account
Patmore	PERSON	wrote at the instance of his wife and a clerical friend , of his conver - sion to
Romanism	LOCATION	; two-thirds of this volume are devoted to the letters , and regarding these we are of opinion that Mr.
Champneys	PERSON	's rever - ence for great names has led him to include some writings that are hardly worth reprinting .

		But the correspondence on the whole is in - teresting , and the list of correspondents is imposing , including such names as
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Aubrey de Vere	PERSON	,
Cardinals Manning	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	,
R. W. Emerson	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, etc. .

		Carlyle 's robust ex - pression of contempt for reviewers we are tempted to quote : '' Unhappily the reviewer too is generally in the exact ratio of his readers , a dark blockhead with braggartism superadded ; probably the supreme blockhead of block - heads , being a vocal one withal , and conscious of being wise .

		Him also we must leave to his fate : an inevitable phenomenon -LRB- ' like people , like priest ' -RRB- , yet a transitory one , he too . ''

		But why , then , make so angry a coil over the doings of so small a creature ?

		Let us conclude our notice of these beauti - fully manufactured volumes with a verse of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's written by him just after a great battle of the Franco-Prussian war , when Ger - man Te Deums were going up in thanksgiving to Him who was supposed to have presided over the slaughter of the French .

		Patmore used to call it '' the most popular poem he ever wrote '' ; and our readers may discern in it a certain present appositeness : '' This is to say , my dear
Augusta	LOCATION	, We ' ve had another awful buster : Ten thousand Frenchmen sent below !

		Thank God from whom all blessings Sow ! ''

Jan. 16	DATE	, MAJOR POND IN REMINISCENT MOOD .

		* For thirty-five years , Major
James B. Pond	PERSON	has been the foremost lecture manager in this country .

		During that time he has managed practically all the famous men and women who have spoken from American platforms .

		Most of these have been his warm personal friends , and have written to him familiarly and charm - ingly .

		He has gathered many of their letters together and included them in a book entitled '' Eccentricities of Genius , '' and we are given glimpses of their idiosyncrasies , their foibles , and their virtues , in a series of personal ob - servations and reminiscences .

		The wit , the wisdom , the anecdote , the talk of famous men and the talk about them , the strangeness and vivacity of many of the incidents , the singu - larity and eminence of the characters , combine to render his volume fascinating , interesting , and instructive .

		In speaking of the '' lecture bureau , '' its sphere and its origin , he says : '' The lyceum platform stands for ability , genius , education , reform , and entertainment .

		On it the greatest readers , orators , and thinkers have stood .

		On it reform has found her noblest advocates , literature her finest expression , progress her bravest pleaders , and humor its happiest translation .

		Some of the most gifted , most highly educated , and warmest-hearted men and women of the English-speaking race have in the
last fifty years	DATE	given their best efforts to the lyceum , and by their noble utterances have made its platform not only his - toric , but symbolic of talent , education , and genius .

		Until the
Redpath Lyceum Bureau	ORGANIZATION	was founded by
James Redpath	PERSON	in
Boston	LOCATION	, in
1867	DATE	, lecture committees were in the habit ' of applying to lecturers and readers direct .

		These committees were usually made up from the leading citizens of the town , with a view to securing the services of the ablest men and women of letters for the entertainment of the public .

		The fee was gen - erally nominal , but sufficient to cover the actual ex - penses of the star and furnish a small honorarium . ''

		Among those who were brought before the public under these early conditions were Ed - ward

		lecturer was also very popular .

		Major Pond notes the change that has come over the spirit of '' the lecture course '' during later years .

		Given at first to discussions of the leading issues of the day , the demand then was for entertainment by traveller and humorist , bring - ing us to the present , in which audiences are demanding the presence of the best in the lit - erary and scientific world , and the story of great exploits or discoveries .

		Major Pond admits that he '' drifted '' into the lyceum business .

		It was while associated with the `` Salt Lake Tribune '' the first Gentile paper in
Utah	LOCATION	that he became ac - quainted with Mrs.
Ann Eliza Young	PERSON	.

		This was shortly after she apostatized .

		One evening it was arranged that she should tell the story of her life to the guests of the
Walker House	ORGANIZATION	, where she had taken refuge under the protec - tion of the officials of the territory
Governor Woods and Chief Justice McKean	ORGANIZATION	.

		She told her story one of the most interesting and thrilling ever rehearsed .

		Her speech was telegraphed to the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	, and the next day she received many telegrams from various persons asking her to lecture .

		One was from
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	, and another from
James Redpath	PERSON	.

		It was conceived that if she could tell her story in
Washington	LOCATION	, the state of
Utah	LOCATION	, instead of being neglected as it was , would get some attention and legislation .

		Major Pond proposed a lecture tour , and she accepted ; it was then that he undertook his first managerial contract .

		Two days later she did tell her story in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Forty-eight hours afterwards the
Poland	LOCATION	bill for the relief of the oppressed in
Utah	LOCATION	was a law .

		It is not surprising to learn that the great triumvirate of lecture kings consisted of
John B. Gough	PERSON	,
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	, and
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	. ''


Gough	PERSON	was one of the heroes of the nineteenth century .

		The incalculable good he did his fellow men can never be known .

		It is no idle statement when we say that he was the direct means , under God , of raising tens of thousands from degradation ... He was a charming man personally modest , unassuming , kind - hearted , and sincere . ''


Wendell Phillips	PERSON	is accredited with being the most polished and graceful orator our country has ever known .

		The author 's recollections of
Beecher	PERSON	extend over many pages . ''

		He had , as I can bear witness , the power of ab - straction by which he could put away all thoughts of care and trouble , and rise to a higher atmosphere where the heavens were unclouded , while his eyes and ears were closed to all lower considerations .

		To those nearest to him at these times this power seemed almost

		THE DIAL 41 superhuman .

		... I remember saying to him one day , after I had seen him walking arm in arm with a man who had injured him , who had been abusing him , < I think you are carrying the doctrine of forgiveness too far . '

		He said : ` Pond , can we go farther than to bless those who curse us , and pray for those who despitefnlly use us ?

		Ah , there is so little known of the spirit of Christ in the world that when a man is trying feebly and afar to follow Him even Christians do not understand it . ' ''

		Emerson called
Charles Sumner	PERSON	'' the whitest soul I ever knew . ''

		Men of whom such remarks may be made with absolute truth are rare in the public life of any .

		nation , and their careers should be kept prominently before each rising generation .

		But
Sumner	PERSON	's faults of character are as well known as his public services he was unconciliating , egotistic , and dogmatic .

		Major Pond and his father were once on the same train with the '' aristocrat . ''

		He was reading in the drawing-room car . ''

		Father stepped up and said : ' The Honorable
Charles Sumner	PERSON	?

		I have read all of your speeches .

		I feel that it is the duty of every American to take you by the hand .

		This is my son he has just returned from the
Kansas	LOCATION	conflict . '

		Honorable
Charles Sumner	PERSON	did not see father nor his son , but he saw the porter and said : ' Can you get me a place where I will be undis - turbed ? '

		Poor father !

		His heart was almost broken . ''

		The author 's estimate of ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	'' is lengthy , and naturally commendatory .

		Suffice to say that he considers him one of the greatest geniuses of our time , and as great a philosopher as humorist .

		The '' eccentricities '' of ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	'' he found unenjoyable .

		The history of professional humorists shows that they have turned their bright side to the world , have laughed and joked , and have so bubbled over with humor that they seem to have no serious side all this with a background of physical disease , or a personal sorrow , that made mental depression inevitable . ''

		Bill Nye '' kept alive his quaint humor in the face of bodily disabil - ity under which men of less courage would have succumbed at once .

		There is a pathetic strain in the account of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	's last appearance on the platform .

		A lecture was given to raise funds to save the
Old South Church	ORGANIZATION	from being torn down .

		The venerable author faced as choice an audience of the blue blood of
Boston	LOCATION	as has ever assembled in that old chapel . ''

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	was introduced .

		As he began read - ing his lecture the audience was very attentive .

		After a few moments he lost his place , and his grand-daughter , sitting in the front row of seats , gently stepped toward him and reminded him that he was lecturing .

		He saw at once that he was wandering , and with a most charm - ing , characteristic , apologetic bow he resumed his place an incident that seemed to affect the audience more than anything else that could have occurred .

		A few moments later he took a piece of manuscript in his hand , and , turning around with it , laid it on a side table .

		Just then one of the audience said to me -LRB- I think it was Mrs.
Livermore	PERSON	or Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	-RRB- , ' Please have the audience pass right out . '

		He had probably been speaking about fifteen minutes .

		The audience passed out , many of them in tears .

		I never read any account of it in the newspapers .

		I suppose it was out of love and veneration for the dear man that the inci - dent did not receive public mention , but there must be a great many still alive who were witnesses to that memorable scene . ''

		Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	was one of the unique characters whom Manager Pond introduced to American audiences .

		He speaks of Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's '' indomitable assurance , '' adding : '' Whatever he said was so because he said so , although I knew better at the time . ''

		Three pages are devoted to Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, who was greatly disappointed at his lack of success in
America	LOCATION	as author-reader .

		Zangwill and
Caine	PERSON	, both smarting at their treatment by the
New York	LOCATION	papers , breakfasting together at the Waldorf , were '' so chopfallen and dejected that they might have put pepper in their cof - fee instead of sugar without knowing the dif - ference . '' ''


Ian Maclaren	PERSON	'' was as much surprised at his audiences as Mr.
Caine	PERSON	was disappointed .

		Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	was also surprised at the welcome tendered him in this country .

		Ameri - can audiences were amazed at the poet-editor 's retentive memory . ''

		One evening in my library Sir
Edwin	PERSON	was reclining on a lounge .

		I was holding a rare volume of Shake - speare , which he had been admiring and had passed to me . '

		Now , Major , ' he said , ' give me the first line from any scene and I 'll give you the whole scene . '

		I gave him a line from the least-known of the plays and , to my astonishment , he recited the entire scene .

		He told me afterward that he could recite Shakespeare from beginning to end . ''

		Speaking of the passage of our international copyright law , Sir
Edwin	PERSON	humorously said : '' Personally I was never a fanatic in the matter .

		I have always rather had a tenderness for those buc - caneers of the ocean of books who , in nefarious bottoms , carried my poetical goods far and wide without any charge for freight . ''

		It is impossible to do more than merely point out the sphere of the book under con - sideration .

		Upwards of a hundred persons all well known names in the world of science , literature , art , and theology are here treated in a gossipy , reminiscent manner .

		The author does not claim to be more than a story-teller , and his book is not more nor less than what he claims it to be .

		A little more indulgent appreciation of the right word in the right place would have added to the literary quality 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, of the work ; but his veneration for the '' aris - tocracy of genius '' overbalances his respect for mere words .

		He has a keen sense of humor it is not every man who can carry a bon mot , and probably no man carries witticisms cor - rectly who has not himself a full comprehension of their point .

		In addition to this , his per - ception of character is acute , and he possesses the rare faculty of being able to single out traits which are peculiar to each person .

		It is not hard to read between the lines , that dealings with celebrities are not always as agreeable as might be hoped .

		Yet , in spite of the cases where bis subjects have been imbued with an exaggerated idea of their own greatness , Major Pond could hardly hesitate in saying , as Bos - well said to Lord Chatham : '' I have the happiness of being capable to contemplate with supreme delight those distinguished spirits by which God is sometimes pleased to honor humanity .

		THEODORE
PARKER	PERSON	AND HIS TIMES .

		* Another biography of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	is welcome .


Weiss	PERSON	's bulky and '' chaotic '' work , which appeared in
1864	DATE	, was written too soon after the stormy life it portrayed had come to a close .

		It was , moreover , the work of one who was too much of a partisan of its hero .

		Yet withal it is a wonderfully interesting book ; we know an Episcopal clergyman who has read it three times .

		Dr.
Frothingham	PERSON	, on the other hand , was in his earlier years a sympathizer with
Parker	PERSON	's theological opponents , a fact which could hardly fail to leave its effect on even hismaturer judgment of the great preacher though Mr.

		excessively radical views .

		He possesses rare lit - erary gifts , especially in the field of biography .

		Naturally , then , we expect from him an ac - curate and vivid picture , if only in outline , of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and his times ; and such the book proves to be .

		The author has set himself the difficult task of compressing the story of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	's life , for which
Weiss	PERSON	-LRB- in - cluding , however , much correspondence -RRB- re - quired a thousand pages and
Frothingham	PERSON	nearly six hundred , into four hundred small pages .

		He would have preferred , he says , to make a book even larger than
Weiss	PERSON	's , draw - ing freely from
Parker	PERSON	's works and correspond - ence ; or , within the limits of a work like the present , to introduce a more largely autobio - graphical element .

		But he has wisely refrained from either course .

		To our generation , the present book will be more really serviceable .

		In these pages
Theodore Parker	PERSON	lives again ^ scholar and teacher , minister , heretic , theo - logian , leader of the enemies of slavery .

		The proportion of the book is good .

		We do not complain that Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	has laid too much stress on the side of the preacher , for we do not think he has .

		Parker , with all his multi - farious reading , book-reviewing , lecturing , and fighting of slavery , was first and last and always a preacher , with the sermonizing habit so firmly rooted that he could never shake it off .

		He felt '' born for a pulpit if for anything . ''

		His othe * r activities , however , were marvellously diverse ; and these Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	has clearly set forth .

		In summing up
Parker	PERSON	's traits and defining his present position in the public estimation , Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	differs from
Frothingham	LOCATION	con - cerning
Parker	PERSON	's lack of '' the atmosphere of devout feeling . ''

		The explanation of this lack Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	finds not in the predominance of
Parker	PERSON	's intellectual power over his religious sensibility , he thinks
Parker	PERSON	's religious sen - sibility was much greater than his intellectual power , but rather in his '' exaggeration of
Martineau	PERSON	's conspicuous defect , that of looking for the significance of religion too rigidly to its intellectual contents . ''

		He agrees with
Frothingham	PERSON	, however , in calling
Parker	PERSON	`` the grandest theist of the time . ''

		Concerning
Parker	PERSON	's philosophical and theological position , Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	, writing a quarter of a century later , naturally goes further than
Frothingham	PERSON	, for in that interim great changes have come about , so great as to '' make
Parker	PERSON	's hetero - doxy seem antiquated , almost absurd , ortho - doxy . ''

		With skill he points out how much fur - ther orthodox critics have now gone than
Parker 1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 thought of going , and how
Parker	PERSON	's doctrine of ' the divine immanence in matter and in man '' is now held by most Christian thinkers .

		But great as was the preacher in
Parker	LOCATION	, the humanitarian was greater .

		He is remem - bered to-day not so much by his sermons , now little read , as by his devotion to discouraged , doubting , and downtrodden humanity .

		The call to aid a fugitive slave was put above everything else .

		He must follow the flag of humanity .

		And to this part of the story Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	does full justice .

		The life of the anti-slavery leader and of the pastor of ten thousand souls , from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Calcutta	LOCATION	, he recounts vividly .

		The make-up of the book is good .

		Some minor corrections have already appeared in print ; in addition we may note -LRB- p. xix . -RRB-

		that the '' National Review '' article of
1860	DATE	, which has been ascribed to
James Martineau	PERSON	, ap - peared in volume x ; and -LRB- p. xiv . -RRB-

		that the discourse on
Daniel Webster	PERSON	was not published till
1853	DATE	.

		The bibliography is fairly full .

		References to Allibone and
Poole	PERSON	for sup - plementary titles might have been added -LRB- cp .

		p. 379 -RRB- ; and why confine the list to English books ?

		Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	was of course aware of

		* The third volume of

		Miracle ,
Peter	PERSON	, Epistles of
Peter	PERSON	, Passover , and Pharisees .

		The point of view of the authors of the articles in this volume is that of historical crit - icism , although in the case of certain contrib - utors there is to be seen a somewhat unexpected disregard of what has come to be accepted as probability .

		Yet even in so conservative an article as that of Dr.
M'Clymont	PERSON	upon the New Testament , critical results are by no means disregarded .

		As a whole , the articles are of exceptional value , although one 's pat - riotism leads one to feel that more work might well have been assigned to American scholars .

		It must be said , too , that some of the articles upon the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	are disappointing , and hardly of the same grade as those dealing with similar subjects in the Old Testament .

		That upon the
New Testament Canon	ORGANIZATION	, for in - stance , is hardly more than a somewhat mod - ernized epitome of
Westcott	LOCATION	, a discussion of the external evidence of different books , which all but ignores the weighty matters of local , partial , and heretical canons , as well as the motives and causes leading to the final adoption of the canon in its present form .

		Similarly , the article upon the Messiah , al - though sufficient for the general reader , will disappoint the special student .

		Altogether admirable , however , are the articles of Pro- fessor Chase upon the Epistles of
Peter	PERSON	, that upon the Second Epistle being a model of method and investigation .

		Professor
Findlay	PERSON	has done characteristically careful work upon Paul the Apostle .

		Here again we have an illustration of the conservative progress of English New Testament scholars .

		Professor
Findlay	PERSON	favors
Lightfoot	PERSON	's view of
Paul	PERSON	's '' thorn in the flesh '' as epilepsy , and holds to the second imprisonment of the Apostle , as well as the older chronological scheme of his life , while adopting the South Galatian theory of
Ramsay	PERSON	.

		It is to be regretted that in its exposition of the
Pauline	LOCATION	thought the treat - ment should have been so much more system - atic than historical .

		Of the two articles by Dr.
Fairweather	PERSON	upon the Maccabees , that upon the history of the family is hardly more than a brief statement of external events , and all but overlooks the great movements of thought and religion that characterized their epoch .

		Professor
Kennedy	PERSON	has produced a most valuable study upon the money of the
Bible	LOCATION	, in which he follows the trend of recent numismatic work in refusing to accept any coin of the Maccabees earlier than
John Hyrcanus	PERSON	.

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, An equally valuable article is that of Professor
McAllister	PERSON	upon Medicine .

		It is , however , quite impossible and almost impertinent to pass these ex cathedra judgments upon such serious and scholarly work as is contained in this volume .

		It would perhaps be better , in a short review , to be content with congratulating the general editor of the Dictionary , Dr.
James Hastings	PERSON	, for his suc - cess , not alone in his selection of contributors , but also in the almost uniform justice with which the space is distributed .

		His work , representing as it does both caution and inde - pendence in the use of scientific methods in biblical study , is certain to have a permanent place and influence in the rapid development of a rational theology .

		THE HINGE OF THE WORLD 'S FUTURE .

		* The criticism of Mr.
Chester Holcombe	PERSON	in '' The Real Chinese Question '' applies to nearly all of the books dealing with the weighty problem on which the future of the entire world may be said to hinge .

		Not the welfare of the Chinese , but that of the various nations of
Christendom	LOCATION	clamoring at the gates of the ancient empire , is the subject of their consideration .

		The talk is all of reparation and indemnity from the Chinese , with never the hint of a suggestion of indemnity or reparation to them for the wholesale atrocities visited upon them by the Allied forces .

		For the most part every author assumes that the European or American point of view , or the point of view of some one of the Christian sects , is the only one from which the present emergency can be grasped ; that the Chi - nese , even in their own country , are strange and inhuman , and that the solution of their problems lies with the statesmen of

		plenipotentiary power must be granted .

		The very remedies proposed show the Caucasian to be a man of like passions with his yellow-skinned congener , and Shylock 's outburst and plea for a common hu - manity comes into mind with every fresh revelation of the wish to place all the moral responsibility upon Chinese shoulders as a preliminary to doing something , ostensibly for his own good , but really for the good of his advisers .

		The book of
M. Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, `` The Awakening of the East , '' is an honorable exception to this .

		Mr.
Henry Norman	PERSON	writes an introduction for it , saying rightly that the three countries treated in the work ,
Siberia	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	, are those concerning which enlightenment is needed before the question of
China	LOCATION	alone can be discussed at all .

		The author is a Frenchman , and has travelled through the lands he describes .

		He gives us not only an account of the position of
Russia	LOCATION	, which seems to be less advantageous than
Great Britain	LOCATION	has generally been disposed to think , but a sympa - thetic survey of the advance of
Japan	LOCATION	, and an illu - minating comparison of
Japan	LOCATION	's condition forty years ago with that of
China	LOCATION	to-day .

		Other writers have seen in the laying off of one culture and the assumption of another , by the people of the
Mikado	LOCATION	, an evidence of instability and lack of moral convic - tion .

		With more insight , our author holds that
Japan	LOCATION	was touched at heart not at all by the Chinese civilization she is so rapidly discarding , and not much by the European garments in which she is clothing herself , her own national life lying calm and undisturbed below them all ; that it is the depth of this life , not its shallowness , which enables the astonishing change to be made .

		In
China	LOCATION	, on the other hand , the civilization of the people is the people itself , and a change is inconceivable except as a preliminary to national suicide .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	, too , the nation worked out its own salvation ; in
China	LOCATION	, a multitude of self-constituted counsellors are stand - ing about suggesting or dictating safety for them - selves .

		He sees in
England	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	the only honest advocates of an open-door policy , and his advice to his countrymen is to secure for
Europe	LOCATION	in
China	LOCATION	such commercial concessions as have been wrested from
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	is an excellent illustration of the writer whose only thought is one of enlightened selfishness ; and it is doubtful if a line in his '' Prob - lem of
Asia	LOCATION	'' has the good of the Chinese nation at heart , except in so far as unhappiness in that coun - try conduces to unhappiness for
Christendom	LOCATION	or to Christian disadvantage . ''

		The propriety of non - interference , '' or '' the conventional rights of a so - called independent state to regulate its own internal affairs , '' are outworn phantasies with him when Chinese affairs are under discussion .

		His advice , then , would be to prevent a preponderance of influ - ence in the East < s n the part of any one of the Powers , and to secure an open door , not in the commercial sense alone , but for the importation of our civilization , lest
China	LOCATION	, waxing fat under in -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 45 creased trade , shall not at the same time acquire '' the corrective and elevating element of the higher ideals , which in
Europe	LOCATION	have made good their con - trolling influence over mere physical might '' -LRB- using his own words -RRB- .

		This is delicious : is it
America	LOCATION	in
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	in
South Africa	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	in
Manchuria	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	in
Madagascar	LOCATION	, or
Germany	LOCATION	in Liao-Tong , which is to set
China	LOCATION	the example of non-aggression a policy which has been Chinese since
Egypt	LOCATION	built the pyramids , and one to which her fabulous extent of national existence is unques - tionably due .

		For the
United States	LOCATION	, our man of war would have us '' respect to the utmost the integ - rity of Chinese territory , and the individuality of the Chinese character in shaping its own govern - ment and polity , '' only '' meddling '' -LRB- his own word -RRB- with their national affairs when `` they become in - ternationally unendurable . ''

		Poor
China	LOCATION	!

		The Reverend Doctor
Condit	PERSON	's book , ' The
China	LOCATION	- man as We See Him , '' says little about the Mon - golian race in its own country , and a great deal concerning its conduct in
America	LOCATION	, particularly in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, where he has been laboring among the Chinese for years .

		Yet it deserves careful study by those who are shaping our national destinies .

		It proves by absolute demonstration that there are more points of resemblance than of difference be - tween the white and the yellow races ; and it holds up to view , with unsparing hand , the vices of the American and his government beside those of his
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	brother .

		Especially significant , in view of what is to follow , is the denunciation of the British Opium War , and the consequent degradation of the pagan by the Christian nation .

		Few defenders of that atrocity are to be found to-day ; but Doctor
Condit	PERSON	points out the damning fact that the English now have an annual revenue of
forty millions of dollars	MONEY	from this international crime one which is beginning to react upon
America	LOCATION	in the spread of the opium habit among us .

		Mr.
Joseph Walton	PERSON	's ''
China	LOCATION	and the Present Crisis '' is based upon observations made during eight months of travel in
Japan	LOCATION	,
Corea	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	, during which time five thousand miles were passed over in the interior of the last-named country .

		It contains a summary of his knowledge delivered before the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	on
March 30	DATE	last , and follows this with a chapter dealing with more recent events , in which certain suggestions are made for a betterment of the situation .

		These suggestions are four in number , comprising a grant to the Chinese government to levy increased duties on imports , but only on these conditions -LRB- how long would the
United States	LOCATION	permit the outside world to dictate its tariff laws ? -RRB-

		: all other taxes on goods to be abolished , and a substantial share of the in - creased revenues to be given the provincial govern - ments ; all officials to be adequately paid ; all inland waterways in
China	LOCATION	to be opened to the world 's commerce ; and all railways built with foreign capital to become the property of the Chinese gov - ernment upon due compensation being granted .

		These conditions are not wholly selfish , in the sense in which the Chinese will not profit by them at all ; but it is to be remarked that nothing but good will flow from them to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, while the assumption by foreigners of the inland com - merce of
China	LOCATION	would throw many millions of Chinese into starvation .

		To a great extent , the interest of Mr.
William Barclay Parsons	PERSON	's '' An American Engineer in
China	LOCATION	'' lies in the account therein given of an ex - tended professional journey through Hu-nan , a practically unknown province of the empire .

		This expedition was undertaken as the result of an American concession for constructing a railway from
Hankow	LOCATION	to
Canton	LOCATION	, nine hundred miles , which , with the mining and other privileges appertain - ing , make it , in value and in national importance , second to no other concession granted by the Chinese Government . ''

		Four hundred miles of its line are to be contained within the '' closed '' prov - ince of Hu-nan , traversing its entire length , so that during more than half the author 's tour he was the first white man ever seen by the resident natives .

		Three other men of European blood had been in the province , but only on its waterways ; and the in - formation given by Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	is of real import - ance .

		The expedition was accompanied by soldiers , and was made at some little personal risk , more from the childish curiosity of the natives , however , than from any ill will .

		Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	remarks that our country has the confidence of the Chinese to an extent unknown by other nations , because of its supposed freedom from international greed ; and this he thinks is worth retaining , on the principle that honesty is the best policy . ''

		Chapters deal - ing popularly with professional subjects , like archi - tectural and railway engineering , add to the value of the book , which is well illustrated .

		`` The Outbreak in
China	LOCATION	'' is due , as the Reverend Doctor
Pott	PERSON	analyses the situation , to a round dozen of causes .

		Among these are listed the Ger - man seizure of Kiao-chao Bay , the forced lease to
Russia	LOCATION	of Port
Arthur	PERSON	, the forced lease to
England	LOCATION	of Wei-hai-wei and the extension at
Kowloon	LOCATION	, the Italian demand for
Sanmen Bay	LOCATION	, the general ex - tension of the foreign settlements , the introduction of railways , the forced concessions to foreigners , the subsidizing of Chinese by foreign capital , and '' missionary enterprise . ''

		These provoking causes , with others which come from the Chinese , are dis - cussed in detail and remedies are suggested .

		The reverend Doctor advises that '' wherever there have been anti-foreign uprisings , punitive expeditions should penetrate , and the guilty , responsible for the massacre of innocent women and children , be made to pay the penalty for their barbarous cruelty .

		The arrogance and self-conceit of ages must be trailed in the dust . ''

		Doctor
Pott	PERSON	advances argu - ments for and against a partition of Chinese terri - tory after
China	LOCATION	has been properly humiliated but nothing distantly resembling a moral concept can be discerned ; he expresses the conviction that 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	will continue their present aggressions ; and advises
America	LOCATION	to re - member that her part should '' not he merely further laud-grabbing , or the increase of commerce , hut the advancement of Christian civilization in the
Far East	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Alexis Krausse	PERSON	, in spite of his un-English name , presents the case of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in '' The Story of the Chinese Crisis , '' leading up to the present status by a justification of the Opium War , and setting forth the two serious mistakes of the British foreign office in dealing with
China	LOCATION	as lying in the seizure of
Fort Arthur	LOCATION	by
Russia	LOCATION	without effective protest , and the assumption of the throne by the
Dowager Empress	ORGANIZATION	.

		He calls attention , as Mr.
Walton	PERSON	did also , to the patent fact that the interests of the British in
China	LOCATION	are of vastly more consequence than those in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and that present preoccupation with the sturdy burghers is likely to result in a tremendous future loss in the
East	LOCATION	presumably a part of the price which Presi - dent
Krueger	PERSON	said
England	LOCATION	would have to pay for South African subjugation . ''

		The Story of
China	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Neville P. Ed	PERSON	- wards , seems intended for the consumption of British jingoes exclusively .

		It deals with the question in a flippant and heartless way , setting forth the history of
England	LOCATION	in
China	LOCATION	with little regard to the facts involved , and displaying no capacity for dealing with the weighty problems of the hour .

		It is plentifully illustrated .

		The republication , after thirty-four years , of Mr.
Freeman-Mitford	PERSON	's `` The Attache ' at Peking '' is important for the curious proof it affords that his - tory repeats itself , and quite as much so for the preface just added to the book , which contains all the suggestions of experience and a point of view that is quite the author 's own .

		He justifies the use of opium in a pipe , and quotes authorities in proof of its harmlessness ; he sets forth the virtues of the Jesuit missionaries in
China	LOCATION	with rare dis - passion ; and he proposes , as one step toward a settlement , that the capital be removed to
Nanking	LOCATION	, which enjoyed that honor during the fifteenth cen - tury .

		The entire book is informing and readable ; but the flying bats printed in gold upon its covers are a poor symbol of its general freedom from prejudice .

		For an American reader , the most informing and satisfactory work of all is Mr.
Chester Holcombe	PERSON	's `` The Real Chinese Question . ''

		The author has had thirty years ' experience in the Empire , half of it spent in an official connection with the
American Legation	ORGANIZATION	at Peking and half in furthering various financial and commercial projects among the Chinese .

		Strange to say , after this wide experience he rather admires the people instead of hating them , and his book comes nearer disinterestedness than any of its fellows .

		The one important ques - tion before the world to-day in respect of
China	LOCATION	, he believes , is the conservation of the integrity of the Chinese government , a position in which he coin - cides with Sir
Robert Hart	PERSON	's recently expressed views .

		To this end he proposes three reforms , which seem to possess a degree of practicality that is absent from most other suggestions .

		He would -LRB- first -RRB- have an imperial standard of weights and measures enforced by the Chinese themselves , pre - sumably as a step toward securing justice in -LRB- secondly -RRB- paying the Chinese officials an adequate salary with consequent inhibition of existing schemes for extortion , followed -LRB- thirdly -RRB- by denying official position to all persons found to be addicted to the opium habit , holding here , with
Doctor Condit	PERSON	, that the opium-user is certain to become a moral alien , unable to distinguish between right and wrong .

		Throughout his interesting work , Mr.
Holcombe	PERSON	never loses sight of the Chinese point of view , and has no hesitancy in laying bare to his readers ' gaze some of the numerous infamies which Christian governments and their people have prac - tised upon the government and people of the
Flowery Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		Yet , at best , the ten books here reviewed leave little hope of a future which will make for the world 's peace or for the continued prosperity of the Caucasian race as the conservator of high ethical ideals .

		Might , not right , sits in the high places , and the possible adoption by peaceful
China	LOCATION	of the militarism of
Europe	LOCATION	and the '' land hunger '' of
America	LOCATION	is indeed a `` Yellow Peril '' whose menace no one may now foretell .

		Mr -
Julian Corbett	PERSON	's study of the
Tudor navy	ORGANIZATION	is brought to a close in a naval hittory .

		work Qn The Successors of Drake '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		This volume carries the reader through the period of hostilities with
Spain	LOCATION	which extended from the death of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	in
1596	DATE	to the conclusion of the war at the accession of James I. For the most part , political histories of
England	LOCATION	do not expand the events of these years ; for with the defeat of the Armada the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	achieved its greatest glory and is supposed to have crushed Spanish sea-power .

		With
Drake	PERSON	's disappearance from the stage , much of the picturesque in English naval action is lost .

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	's more thorough examination into the history of this period leads him to believe that the famous sea-fight , far from being a crowning victory , was but a prelude to more serious contests , and that it required ten more years to so strengthen the British navy that
Philip	PERSON	would admit his inability to crush
England	LOCATION	.

		The dying Spanish king advised his son to make peace , but both king and nation were reluctant , and with the final peace
Spain	LOCATION	yielded nothing of the West Indian trade .

		These years were years of change and great development in maritime methods .

		The dash and recklessness of the earlier leaders , their strange mixture of puritanism and piracy , gave
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 way to a business-like system of making war for df finite objects .

		Technical knowledge came to be regarded as essential for the command of ships .

		The result was ultimately a navy more powerful than any
Spain	LOCATION	could produce , acknowledging but one rival , the Dutch .

		Thus , while the romance of war departed with
Drake	PERSON	, it was in the years that followed that a permanent British sea-power was created .

		History , says Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	, has not justly appreciated the importance of this latter period .

		Still , the present volume treats of some characters and episodes surely picturesque , if not heroic .

		Essex and
Raleigh	LOCATION	strove to emulate the brilliant exploits of
Drake	PERSON	and
Hawkins	PERSON	, and in the capture of
Cadiz	LOCATION	came near the maik .

		Essex , indeed , until political intrigue had sapped his influence and exhausted his patience , is presented as a man of unusual attain - ments , and one unfairly treated by historians .


Raleigh	LOCATION	, on the other hand , has been over-estimated by writers .

		Secure in the Queen 's favor , important commands were given him ; and these , together with his charming writings , served to give him an undeserved reputation for naval wisdom .

		That men of the Elizabethan period were fully conscious of the power of the press , is seen in the fact that both
Essex	LOCATION	and
Raleigh	LOCATION	, upon the capture of
Cadiz	LOCATION	, sent off post-haste to
London	LOCATION	a private messenger with a full account of the exploit , written for personal glory .

		Each hero wished to rush into print ; but the shrewd
Cecil	PERSON	captured and suppressed both messages , and issued only the official account of
Lord Howard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	has produced a schol - arly work .

		Research and discrimination are evident throughout .

		Extreme detail prohibits popularity in a sense , as does also the necessarily technical char - acter of much of the work ; yet there are many pages of brilliant description and of illuminating analysis . ''

		The Builders of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	'' 8erie8 -LRB- Longman -RRB- is brought to a conclusion in the publication of a volume on
Sir Stamford Raffles	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Hugh E. Egerton	PERSON	.

		The book is unmistakably the best of the series in literary workmanship and in biographical style , though not in intrinsic interest .

		Sir
Stamford Raffles	LOCATION	was a poor boy who , by sheer hard work , fought his way up to a position of confidence in the home office of the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1805	DATE	he was sent to Prince of
Wales Island	LOCATION	, and sub - sequently served in
Java	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	, and
Singapore	LOCATION	, in important capacities .

		He was responsible for the English exploitation of
Singapore	LOCATION	as a check upon Dutch influence in the
East	LOCATION	, and it is mainly for this service that he is included in the present series .

		Yet this was not his only claim upon public recognition , for he was endowed in an unusual degree with the qualities which have created British empire .

		He was hampered by instructions from
England	LOCATION	, yet , assuming the independence to act and to refer afterwards , he succeeded in executing his own designs without coming into immediate collision with the home office .

		Fortunately for
England	LOCATION	,
Raffles	ORGANIZATION	was but one of a host of agents who , overstepping the limits set by central authority , effected permanent improvement and expansion .

		Mr.
Egerton	PERSON	asserts that
Raffles	ORGANIZATION	was a conscious philanthropic expansionist , that a desire to better native conditions went hand in hand with business administration , and that his term of office was marked by decided improvement in native life .

		This actual betterment was undeniably achieved ; nevertheless it is not difficult to see that to
Raffles	ORGANIZATION	's mind
England	LOCATION	's foreign power , the Company 's finances , and native improvement , held importance in the order stated .

		Nor did he disdain to use all the accustomed methods of doubtful intrigue to secure the submission of native princes .

		Thus after a successful war , begun in intrigue , he wrote : A population of not less than a million has been wrested from the tyranny and oppression of an in - dependent , ignorant , and cruel Prince , and a country yielding to none on earth in fertility and cultivation , affording a revenue of not less than
a million of Spanish dollars	MONEY	in the year , placed at our disposal . ''

		Raffles was never idle ; he worked hard , aged early , and died in retirement in
England	LOCATION	at forty-six ,
July 5 , 1826	DATE	.

		He is an excellent illustration of the energetic colonial administrator , honest and upright in his motives , and in action as humane as to him the circumstances warranted .

America	LOCATION	* Soldier .

		mo8t * U8 to vlew wltn a jealous eye the military branch of the fed - eral public service has undoubtedly wrought some injustice , in that it has prevented due recognition of the fine soldierly qualities , the unswerving good citizenship , the arduous services in the policing and opening up to the settler of our far - western domain , of our regular army ; and we therefore gladly com - mend to all American readers , as an excellent his - torical sketch and a temperate though feeling and forcible plea for a body of men who deserve excep - tionally well of their country , the little book wherein General
George A. Forsyth	PERSON	, a gallant soldier and an attractive , virile writer , tells '' The Story of the Soldier '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		General
Forsyth	PERSON	's story of the growth as an establishment of the army , and of its more signal exploits in the field , is necessarily an outline sketch , but it is graphic , vigorously drawn , and based on wide experience .

		Its aim is to give the reader a correct idea of the soldier of the
United States	LOCATION	army as he really is .

		The vol - ume opens with an account of the inception of the army , its raison d'etre , and the sources whence its officers are commissioned .

		A chapter is devoted to the characteristics and development of the soldier his surroundings , perquisites , and pay .

		To read - ers with a taste for adventure the chapters on the various campaigns in our chronic Indian wars will prove satisfying .

		There are a half-dozen striking illustrations by Mr.
R. F. Zogbanm	PERSON	.

		The pen of
General Forsyth	ORGANIZATION	and the pencil of Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, are again interestingly in evidence in the volume containing four stories of personal experiences in Indian Warfare and in the Civil War , and entitled `` Thrilling Days in Army Life '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The titles are : `` A Frontier Fight '' ; `` An Apache Raid '' ; ''
Sheridan	PERSON	's Ride '' ; '' The Closing Scene at
Appomattox Court-House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The title of the book does not belie the contents .

		The stories are '' thrilling '' enough , and they are the better for be - ing so modestly and directly told .

		The book has the sharp literalism of the account of an eye - witness ; and its quality is not impaired by any straining at rhetorical effect .

		Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	's pic - tures are decidedly good in their way , and there are sixteen of them .

		No one is familiar with the history of the
Tennyson	PERSON	family , or , more specifically , with the '' Memoirs '' prepared by the second
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, without being aware of the intimacy between that distin - guished group and the family of the Reverend
H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	. ''

		Memories of the Tennysons '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the hand of the honorary
Canon of Carlisle	ORGANIZATION	, will therefore be welcomed as tending to cast new light on the individualities of the most distinguished band of brothers in English literature .

		The chief concern of the author is , of course , with
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, and many interesting anecdotes are given , none of them disclosing any unsuspected traits of a man so fully contemporaneous and so fortunate in his biographies , yet all rounding out toward completeness our knowledge of that com - manding personality .

		The incidents are set forth with great good nature and entire frankness , in - cluding some corrections of Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	's speech by the Laureate , as when he insisted upon the pronunciation of '' knowledge '' with the '' o '' as in '' know '' an eccentricity of speech due , like many others , to his northern English origin .

		A chapter not less interesting than the others is devoted to
Charles Tennyson Turner	PERSON	; while the book is pre - faced by a series of homely anecdotes rescued from servants and villagers who knew the Tennysons of old .

		An interesting photograph of
Alfred Tenny	PERSON	- son has been reproduced for the frontispiece , and the charm of the Reverend Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	's style makes the book a contribution to literature in more senses than one . ''

		The individual , Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	, as a partial a study of Life result of thirty-five years of teach - ing , has presented , in `` The Indi - vidual , a Study of Life and Death '' -LRB-
Appleton	PERSON	-RRB- , an application of the theory of evolution to some of the greatest concerns of mankind .

		A consideration of the purely physical realm , and then of that realm which contains life , shows that the organic form is differentiated from the inorganic by its capacity to gather and store experience .

		Thus each successive generation of individuals is nourished , the older form , after having transmitted its garnered experi - ence , disappearing to make room for the newer .

		Even before man is reached in the chain of life , death is established as an indispensable corollary and condition of advancement .

		Educableness , then , is the differentiating quality of the organic indi - vidual .

		And death is due , not merely to the process of natural selection , the survival of the fittest , but also to the sacrifice needed for the due devel - opment of the oncoming race .

		Though the indi - viduality of each man amounts to isolation , it is only in mankind that the power of sympathy reaches its height .

		Sympathy finds expression in language , and otherwise , and is prompted by natural and tribal affection , the religious motive , property , and especially by social institutions .

		It is in sympathetic outgoing to the needs of his kind that man best conquers the fear of death .

		Professor
Shaler	PERSON	has made several suggestive departures from the strict scope of his field .

		War , he says , is waste of the young life , that , reared at great cost , is not allowed to perfect its contribution to the good of the whole .

		Old age should be secured to larger number , and in modern society can be utilized for the general profit as never before .

		Immortality is not denied by the discoveries of latter-day science , while there are certain observed facts that tally with belief in a life beyond death .

		As a whole , this book is the result of such observation , experience , and wisdom as a young man could not have had .

		Its pages are frequently illuminating outside the line of their direct discussion .

		The open mind and the rever - ence of the writer are everywhere evident .

		As a single word of blame amidst the praise there is room in a second edition for the correction of nu - merous small errors , due to imperfect proof-reading .

		Professor
Frank J. Goodnow	PERSON	is a pro- lific wr i ter as we u as a logical and forcible one .

		His magnum opus on '' Comparative Administrative Law , '' published in
1893	DATE	, was soon followed by his '' Municipal Home Rule '' and '' Municipal Problems , '' and to these he has now added a work entitled `` Politics and Ad - ministration , a Study in Government '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- .

		The title corresponds to the author 's division of the functions of government into the political and the administrative the expression and the execution of the state 's will the judicial function being classed as a subdivision of administration .

		Like Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	lays much stress upon extra-legal institutions ; and he gives in an interesting way the history and philosophy of such spontaneous political growths as the party , the spoils system , and the boss .

		He advises legal rec - ognition of political parties , in a way to make them and their leaders responsible to the public , and finds encouragement in
England	LOCATION	's development of responsible government and efficient administration out of corrupt bossism and a corrupt and inefficient civil service .

		His other principal recommendation is in the direction of a reasonable centralization of the American administrative system , coupled with an extension of the principle of self-government .

		The treatment Whatever store the world may set and training by severe academic training , there / children .

		are t j me8 w hen the absence of it is refreshing .

		Such an instance was to be found in Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins	PERSON	Oilman 's '' Women and Economics , '' and another is now afforded by her newer work '' Concerning Children '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To a degree hardly known outside of that remarkable family of Beechers of which she is a member , Mrs.
Gil	PERSON	man 's work possesses a quality that provokes discussion .

		Whether her readers find themselves in complete disagreement with her and thus forced to set up a position of their own , or holding to certain of her tenets for reasons the reverse of hers , there is hardly a page of her work that does not have its effect from her manner of presentation .

		She announces with some - thing of the joy of the discoverer that children have rights of all kinds which the adult is bound to re - spect .

		She does not believe for a moment that a stupid , perverse , or untrained mother is better fitted to bring up her own child than an intelligent , re - ceptive , thoroughly disciplined instructor .

		She sees no reason no spiritual or intellectual reason why a man of the highest attainments should re - gard it as an honor to instruct youths of twenty , when he can do a thousand times more good by teaching infants of two .

		She does not think women from the lowest walks in life are the best companions for ingenuous youth in kilts ; and the
Southern	LOCATION	contempt for the negro as an associate , with a placid acquiescence in any negro being a good enough mentor for the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	child , she regards as more than incongruous .

		But we can not go further into the details of this wholesomely disturbing book , which deserves to be read on its own account .

		`` Apes and Monkeys , Their Life and Language '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is his most important popular account of his recent work in searching out the psychology of the brute creation nearest us in development , physical and intellectual .

		It contains a brief narrative of his stay in the wilds of
Africa	LOCATION	during his attempts to catch the speech and observe the manners of the manlike apes in the open forests .

		The account of the words and vocal articulations used by these animals for the conveyance of ideas is , it may be presumed , to be followed by a less popular and more scientifically exact work on the subject .

		It is to be noted with regret that Mr.
Garner	PERSON	appears to be so unfamiliar with the study of phonetics that he has gone to the pains of in - venting a system of notation for the sounds used by his brute companions , when Mr.
Alexander Graham Bell	PERSON	's '' visible speech '' would have an - swered every purpose better .

		Mr.
Garner	PERSON	says of one of his chimpanzees -LRB- page 116 -RRB- that he `` suc - ceeded in teaching him one word of human speech , '' a statement not borne out by his fuller account of the experiment -LRB- pp. 135 et & eq . -RRB-

		Doctor
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	provides an interesting introduction for the book , which is handsomely designed and illustrated .

		Reference book ^ n tne preface to his work on '' Pre - / Prehistoric historic Implements '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Warren K. Moorehead	PERSON	warns us that his book is a reference-book for col - lectors , not a hand-book for the professional archae - ologist .

		There are , he informs us , four thousand five hundred persons in the
United States	LOCATION	who own collections of relics containing from fifty to twenty - five thousand specimens .

		His book aims to direct the efforts of these collectors to profitable ends .

		There is no question that its influence will be help - fully felt .

		The prehistoric relics of the
United States	LOCATION	are described by geographical areas .

		Some of these are discussed by Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	himself , but nine assistants , '' editors , '' have presented the facts regarding their own local fields .

		This diver - sity of authors has led to a fairly full though uneven treatment of hitherto somewhat neglected areas ; but a well-digested , connected , and sym - metrical presentation of the same material by one person would have been far more satisfactory .

		It is unfortunate that the illustrations are not better , and that greater care was not taken with the word - ing of the text and in proof-reading .

		While a long list of errata is given in the early part of the book , it does not begin to give the errors ; there are probably more unnoted errors than pages in the book .

		The fact that Mr.
Moorehead	PERSON	's health was in a precarious condition during the time when the book was being prepared is some excuse for the unsatisfactory form in which it appears .

		The text is contributed by special authorities in the various countries represented , and forms a comprehensive and reliable , though necessarily brief , survey of the subject But the main interest of the volume lies in the collection of illustrations , which would do credit to a much more ambitious and expensive work .

		Every artist commented upon in the text is represented , many of the pictures having been drawn especially for this purpose .

Gibson	PERSON	-RRB- the drawings selected are not always fairly representative of the artist 's ability .

		But these are minor blemishes that can detract but little from one 's enjoyment of the work , which is really a remarkable one for the price .

		Mr.
Frank Hendrick	PERSON	, Ricardo prize fellow in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, has written a useful monograph on `` Railway Control by Commissions '' -LRB-
Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's `` Questions of the Day '' series -RRB- , in which he gives an account of railway regulation in
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,

United States	LOCATION	, describing most fully the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts system , which he especially admires , and concluding that the best form of control is secured by a permanent commission without power .

		After summarizing the proposals of various writers for solving the railway problem , the author submits as his own solution , -LRB- 1 -RRB- the permission of pooling , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the abolition of the quasi - judicial power of the

		Mr.

Forrest	ORGANIZATION	's cavalry a day or two after the battle of
Chickamauga	LOCATION	,
Sept. 19 , 1863	DATE	, and was finally paroled on
Feb. 27 , 1865	DATE	, after a variety of experiences , in prison and en route from one prison to another , that are well worth the telling .

		The style of the narrative is terse , blunt , and unpolished , and there is a certain bitter - ness of tone throughout born of the rankling mem - ory of scenes of brutality , and of ill-treatment at the hands of ruffians of the
Wirz	PERSON	type , whom the war clothed with a little brief authority .

		That '' war is hell '' Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	's book graphically attests .

Wickford	LOCATION	, R. I .

		The little volume seems in some sort a labor of love , and the author 's manifest at - tachment to the scenes whereof she writes imparts a tinge of pleasing sentiment to her style .

NEW YORK	LOCATION	CITY A SPECIAL OFFER TO LIBRARIES A YEAR ago we published an authoritative biography of Sir
Arthur ^ * Sullivan	PERSON	, and the book had a good sale through the retail trade .

		We were disappointed , however , by the fact that it was not purchased more generally by the libraries .

		The work is acknowledged by those who have seen it to be a definitive life of the great composer , and we were assured that it deserved a place in all libraries .

		We infer that libra - rians do not know the work suffi - ciently well to justify themselves in ordering it , and we are therefore appeal to a large part of the public .

		84 OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES .

		An interesting article contributed by Mr.
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	to the
January	DATE	'' International Monthly '' sums up the progress of recent years in American library development .

		The public library in the
United States	LOCATION	has become so important a part of our educational ma - chinery and so influential a factor in our intellectual life that the principal facts con - cerning its development should be in the pos - session of every intelligent person , and it is desirable that they should be summed up from time to time by some writer of Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's experience and authority .

		As librarian of our great national collection of books he is officially at the head of his profession in the
United States	LOCATION	, and those who know anything of his zeal and his equipment do not need to be told that the profession could not well have a worthier leader .

		The very use of this word '' profession '' suggests what is probably the most striking fact of all in the history of the American library movement .

		Twenty-five years ago , people thought of a librarian as a custodian of books , usually a helpless sort of person as far as practical affairs were concerned , and not infrequently a crusty one .

		To speak of his occupation as a profession was to use strange language , and to make one look askance at the speaker .

		And indeed , there were then few professional librarians to be found .

		But the pioneer work which was being done by
Poole	PERSON	and
Winsor	PERSON	, together with a few of their con - temporaries , has since then borne rich fruit , and librarianship is now a professional calling in as exact and distinct a sense as is the occu - pation of the lawyer or the physician .

		It has its professional schools and associations , its professional ideals and ethical principles , just as the bar and the pulpit have them , and may be taken up as a life vocation with the same certainty that opportunity for its exercise will be found , and that success will be the reward of exceptional ability .

		This settlement of the librarian 's status has been made , as we have already mentioned , during the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

		A good 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, many other things of importance to the pro- fession have also been done during the same period , such , for example , as the establishment and maintenance of '' The Library Journal , '' the formation of the American Library Asso - ciation , and the adoption of enlightened library legislation by a large number of the States .

		The decade of the seventies witnessed the be - ginnings of all three of these movements , for , although there were library laws before that time , the
Illinois	LOCATION	statute of
1872	DATE	set a new pace , and placed the public library upon a more substantial foundation than had before sup - ported it .

		When we speak of the advance in library economy and administration , and of the methods by which libraries have increased their helpfulness for all classes of users , we are at a loss to know where to begin in the enumeration of things done .

		A rough list will include
State	ORGANIZATION	commissions , travelling libraries , open shelves , popular lectures , children 's depart - ments , delivery stations , the extension of service into the schools , annotated lists for readers , and cooperative methods of cataloguing .

		To the outsider , these terms mean little that is definite , but to the close observer of recent library activities , each of them connotes an agency of approved educational value , and a development to which a volume might easily be devoted .

		One result of all this multiplication of ac - tivities is , however , sure to impress the most casual observer , and is equally sure of being misunderstood .

		In the old days , the funds of a library were largely devoted to the purchase of books ; in our own times , the purchase of books seems to have become a matter of minor importance .

		It is rather startling to learn that the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for every dollar of its income that goes into books , spends ten dollars in other ways , yet such is about the proportion that must be exhibited by the bud - get of any institution of the size of one of our great city libraries .

		Nor will one thoroughly conversant with the services performed through the agency of a modern library building , and by the labors of its trained staff , find it pos - sible to deny that the ten dollars are as wisely and usefully expended as the one .

		The scholar may object , but public libraries are not for the benefit of the scholar alone , and the class to which he belongs , at any rate , gets as large a share of their benefits as any ocher class .

		Indeed , no collection of books can be of much value to the community as a whole , unless the means for exploiting it , and for bringing it to bear upon every form of intellectual need and craving , are provided quite as generously as are the books themselves .

		Every library , for example , soon reaches a point at which a few thousand dollars may far more judiciously be expended upon the preparation of an expert catalogue than upon any additions , however urgently demanded , to its stores .

		It is dif - ficult for a layman to see this , but to the in - itiated , it becomes a proposition so obvious as to need no demonstration .

		The public library of the twentieth century is not going to abandon any of the methods , worked out in so painstaking a fashion , by which our public collections of books have been made second in educational importance to the public schools alone .

		They will all be devel - oped still further in the direction of helpfulness , of the bridging over of difficulties , and of the stimulation of an interest in reading among all classes .

		To them still other methods will be added from time to time , even at the cost of still further lessening the funds with which books are bought , for the purpose of a library is not to preserve books , but to circulate them .

		And approval of the methods of modern pro- fessional librarianship will continue to be evi - denced , as in the past , and in a constantly growing ratio , by increased public support and by the still greater multiplication of generous private foundations .

		Our country leads the world in the use that it makes of public libra - ries , and it is going to maintain the leadership already won by every means that are now de - vised , or may hereafter be devised .

		We have no intention of going into prophesy at this time , but we will venture one prediction , to the effect that the next marked development of library activity will be found in the schools , and that books will be brought to bear upon the studies of young people to an extent , and with beneficial results , of which few educators now dream .

		When the use of books comes to have as important a part in the work of the historical and literary group of studies as the use of the microscope and the balance now has in the scientific group of studies when in every school the library shall be as well pro- vided as the laboratory now is then the next important step in education will have been made , and men will wonder why it should have been left for the
twentieth century	DATE	to make .

		We content ourselves here with this general statement , reserving a more detailed and spe - cific treatment of the subject for some future occasion .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 A LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL NOVEL .

		Amending a familiar thought , a novel is a picture of life seen through the prism of an author 's mind .

		When the picture seems to as clear and true , we recognize its technical excellence ; and if in addi - tion it has the interest that attaches to a truthful transcript of action , passion , character , and thought , we call the picture a great one .

		Amid the discussions which centre around the his - torical novel , it appears strange that no more effort has been made to differentiate it from the others .

		It seems taken for granted that an historical novel is an historical novel ; hut the varying treatment of the theme shows the widely differing ideas which exist on the subject .

		A distinction would be useful , and should not be exceedingly hard to make .

		Any novel is certainly in one sense historical , but by carrying out logically the common and somewhat hazy idea we can arrive at a definition that carries with it the necessary distinction .

		Should we not consider the true historical novel as one which has to do with people seeming to have had a part in the greater events , the larger forces , that make history ?

		To illustrate the distinction carried in this def - inition , look at ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' and ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	. ''

		Probably the former is a more truthful , as it cer - tainly is a more convincing , picture of bygone days than the latter ; but one would not think of classing them together .

		Of the novels of history accessible to English readers there are few indeed which can be placed in the front rank ; for many a work which would reach this place is barred by a lack of one or more of the essential characteristics , among which are good workmanship , a convincing portrayal of life , a life in the main current of events .

		The fatal defect , and the most common , is the absence of that spirit which would give us the innate motif of the time .

		Take for an example '' Ivanhoe , '' one of the most celebrated novels in the language .

		The story is most interesting , the picture is clear , it has the interest that attaches to well-drawn action and character ; but its people are moderns , living par - tially the mediaeval life ; we get from the book hardly the slightest inkling of the basic brntishness and savagery of the time .

		That chivalry which was only a fall of lace on the dirty clothing of society is transformed by the touch of the wizard 's pen into the fabric itself .

		The fault is characteristic both of
Scott	PERSON	and of the great school which has followed in his footsteps , though all will admit that we owe to this school some splendid stories .

		Kings - ley 's best works , '' Hypatia , '' '' Westward-Ho , '' and '' Hereward , '' have this same lack ; but it seems certain that had
Kingsley	PERSON	not been so hampered by his profession and his public , his work would stand in the foreground , for he had in him much of the artistic essence , and red blood runs in the veins of his people .

		Consider for a moment two novels which cer - tainly do stand in the foreground of literature .

		The Three Musketeers '' is a model in its way , but the ground on which the heroes stand we feel to be a little uncertain ; a glowing , shifting haze hangs over and between us and `` the immortal three who were four . ''

		Still , it would take greater faults than these to displace so good a story .

		The other , ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	, '' of all the acknowledged standards , should probably be placed first , for it has almost every element which goes to the making of the ideal historical novel .

		Of course ,
Thackeray	PERSON	shrinks from a full portrayal ; but the real life is so suggested where it can not be told , the action and plot are so interesting , the characters are so clear - cut , the men and events treated are so important to the period , that the novel is practically above criticism , and to many it has seemed above success - ful rivalry .

		But in the universe of letters a new planet has swum into the ken of recent observers .

		We have now a writer who perhaps more fully than any other has met the requirements of a literary mas - terpiece , and that man is the Polish author ,
Sien	PERSON	- kiewicz .

		He who has not yet made the acquaintance of the trilogy , `` With Fire and Sword , '' `` The Deluge , '' and '' Pan
Michael	PERSON	, '' has before him the pleasure of reading works almost unique , that carry out nearly to perfection the idea of a great historical novel putting before us , in a light as vivid as our latter day ideas will permit us to enjoy , the life of the past .

		These stories oft-times lack delicacy of touch and finish ; they have incidents that seem needlessly brutal and reach the limits of our in - dulgence ; they treat of life and character so alien that at first thought they seem unreal .

		Tet we soon know that we are seeing life as men lived it , that the author is a creator of people who live and move and have being .

		We find characters drawn with an unerring hand ; we come to understand that a master of masters is putting before us the rush and sweep of great events , the elemental passions , all the vital constituents of the life of the time of which he treats .

		We have some new friends when we have finished these stories .

		There is that '' combination of Ulysses and Falstaff , ''
Zagloba	LOCATION	.

		with his unfailing resource and wit , with the most human and laugh - able and lovable admixture of courage and cow - ardice , of selfishness and generosity , a character destined to live among the few immortal creations of fiction .

		There is that whole company of noble - men , imbued with the strangest compound of religion and savagery , of singlemindedness and subtlety , men of a race whose spirit is in many ways repel - lant to us , yet which compels our admiration and respect , for it formed the bulwark between
Europe	LOCATION	and the powers of darkness .

		There is hardly an indistinct character amid them all , nor among those charming women whom they loved and whom we love .

		Above all , there is Pan
Michael	PERSON	, whose fortunes we follow through the trilogy the little man who never met his match 68 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, with the sword -LRB- and that not from lack of trying -RRB- ; the faithful friend , the devoted lover of his king , his country , and woman .

		Here is a man whom we love as we do
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	and for the same reason , which is that our hearts go out to him who is not too far removed from earth , a man who boldly and fearlessly works out his fate .

		We have a sense of something lacking in a hero like
Henry Esmond	PERSON	.

		Who of us does not feel some sympathy with
Beatrix	PERSON	when she tells him he would have gotten along better w \ th her had he not been on his knees to her so much .


Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's later and more popular '' Quo Vadis '' is far inferior as a novel to any one of the trilogy , though one must recognize the power of the descriptions , the strength of the characters especially that of Petronius and the realism of the whole , this last being the crucial test .

		The novel in which
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	has last been presented to English readers , '' The Knights of the Cross , '' is hardly up to the standard of his best , though strong and fine in every way .

		The impression made by
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	is best characterized by saying that after almost any other novelist one feels that he has been looking at a pic - ture , or at best at a `` moving picture . ''

		After
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	one feels that he has looked on life .

		SOME NEGLECTED MATERIAL IN ANTI-SLAVERY LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	, in his '' Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' seems to have neglected certain obvious opportunities iu dealing with the literary history of the Anti-Slavery agitation .

		There died in
Ohio	LOCATION	as far back as
1833	DATE	,
Charles B. Storrs	PERSON	, President of Western Re - serve College , who was the real pioneer of the remark - able Anti-Slavery or Abolition movement in that part of the country , which soon involved
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	and
Wade	PERSON	.

		Yet Professor
Wendell	PERSON	, who devotes much space not simply to Anti-Slavery literature , but to the Anti-Slavery agitation in general , has not a word for
Storrs	LOCATION	, whose services for the cause in the West were fully recognized by the
New England	LOCATION	workers for that same cause , as is shown by
Whittier	LOCATION	's beautiful elegy .

		This brings me to the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor 's omission of a literary landmark which is unexplainable , as it was not a Western but a distinctly
New England	LOCATION	landmark .

		The author dwells at length and most in - terestingly on Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's epoch-marking `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' but he makes not the slightest allusion to the initial literary work of the propaganda .

		In
1833	DATE	, the same year when
Storrs	LOCATION	, the pioneer of Abolition in
Ohio	LOCATION	, died , Mrs.
Lydia Maria Child	PERSON	-LRB- nee
Francis	PERSON	-RRB- , a native of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, published '' An Appeal for That Class of Americans Called Africans , '' which was the first Anti-Slavery book published in
America	LOCATION	.

		It may not be generally known as such , for Allibone does not so state , nor does he give the exact title of the book , nor any date whatsoever , but the fact is incon - testible , and as such of course deserving of a place in the literary history of the country .

		That it has none in the work of Professor
Wendell	PERSON	, taken in conjunction with numerous other important omissions , may seem to some an indication of inconsiderate haste ou his part , and to a certain extent to detract from the dignity of history , titularly claimed for his work .

		It is probable that the Anthology of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	will be regarded by the judicious as proof of the pov - erty of our American poetic lore rather than as con - vincing evidence of our riches .

		It will be generally conceded , however , that
Edgar Allen Poe	PERSON	was a real poet ; only his contributions are so small .

		But one of his most characteristic and attractive gems is marred in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's book by one of the most diabolical blunders of misquotation in all the annals of printing ; and this will be copied no doubt unwittingly many times .

		I refer to the lines '' To One in Paradise '' : '' And all my days are trances , And all my nightly dreams Are where thy dark eye glances And where thy footstep gleams In what ethereal dances , By what eternal streams . ''

		Instead of '' dark eye '' Mr.

		* The story is told of the third
Earl	PERSON	of Shaftes - bury that , rising to make his maiden speech in Parliament on the bill allowing counsel to a prisoner accused of treason , he became so em - barrassed and confused as to break down alto - gether ; but being encouraged by the
House	ORGANIZATION	to go on , he made a great impression by the in - genuous remark : '' If I , sir , who rise only to speak my opinion on the bill now depending , am so confounded that I am unable to express the least of what I proposed to say , what must the condition of that man be who is pleading for his life without any assistance and under apprehension of being deprived of it ? ''

		This happy turn pleased his listeners extremely , and was thought to have done more toward passing the bill than any of the more solid arguments advanced in its support .

		The incident is char - * THE LIFE , UNPUBLISHED LETTERS , AND PHILOSOPH - ICAL REOIHEN OF ANTHONY , EARL OF SHAFTESBURY .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 69 acteristie of the man , and stamps him as a worthy predecessor to the noble and philan - thropic seventh
Earl of Shaftesbury	PERSON	, his more famous descendant .

		Dr.
Rand	PERSON	's volume on the third
Lord Shaftes	PERSON	- bury deals far less with the public life of the Earl than with that inward growth revealed by his philosophical writings and private corre - spondence .

		Indeed , his delicate constitution prevented him from engaging actively in poli - tics , although he seems to have made his mark in
Parliament	LOCATION	, and was offered the secretary - ship of state by
King William	LOCATION	, whose trusted adviser he continued to be for some years .

		He died an early death in
1713	DATE	, within a few weeks of his forty-second birthday .

		His son 's biography of him , first published in
Bayle	LOCATION	's '' General Dictionary , '' and now reprinted , with some additions from the biographer 's manu - scripts , in this volume , and Series V. of the
Shaftesbury Papers	ORGANIZATION	, preserved in the
Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, are the chief sources of our information regarding the
Earl	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Rand	PERSON	devotes nearly half of his portly volume to the Letters , rather more than half to the '' Philosophical Regimen , '' and fourteen pages to the brief '' Life , '' all , excepting the letters to
Locke	PERSON	and the biog - raphy , being published for the first time from the
Shaftesbury Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the non-classical student the book may seem to bristle formidably with Greek and Latin quotations , but a second glance will show that these are nearly all translated or para - phrased , so that his alarm is groundless .

		To the lover of the classics the volume will have a flavor of old-fashioned scholarship not un - grateful in an age which sees the editor of a leading English literary review gravely refer - ring to the temple of
Janus	ORGANIZATION	as closed in time of war , and an editorial writer in one of our own most scholarly journals ascribing the '' Miles Gloriosus '' to
Terence	PERSON	.

		The disciple of
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	will be glad to give the '' Philosophical Regimen '' a place beside the '' Enchiridion '' and the ''
Medita	PERSON	- tions . ''

		The key-note of the work is struck in the essay on '' Improvement , '' where , after re - ferring to the practice of making memoranda for various less worthy uses , the author con - tinues : `` Would one think of making any for
Lifef Would	ORGANIZATION	one think that this were a business to improve in ?

		What if this should be the thing of all others chosen out for a pocket-book and memorandums ?

		But so it is .

		... Begin therefore and work upon this subject .

		Collect , digest , methodize , abstract .

		How many codes , how many volumes , how much labour , and what com - piling in the study of other laws ?

		But in the law of life how ?

		They who seek not any such in life , nor think that there is any rule , what are they better than vulgar ? ''

		It is to be regretted that the style of the work is so largely that of the note-book , in which occasional memoranda are jotted down with little regard to literary form .

		Nearly always labored and often bombastic in his ut - terance , the author has repelled rather than attracted readers .

		Even his once famous '' Characteristics '' has long lain neglected .

		Yet we should not forget that he was admired in his own century by such critics as
Hurd	ORGANIZATION	and
Blair	PERSON	.

		That he should have had so little of
Addison	PERSON	's elegance , of Swift 's perspicuity , simplicity , and strength , of
Steele	PERSON	's ease and vivacity , and all three of these were his im - mediate contemporaries , is somewhat sur - prising .

		But occasionally his manner is hardly less admirable than his matter , as when , treat - ing of the passions , he writes thus aptly and forcibly concerning '' Joy '' : '' There is one sort of joy which is fierce , eager , boisterous , impetuous , restless , which carries with it a sort of insatiableness , rage , madness , sting ; and which afterwards is followed by disgust and discontent .

		There is another sort of joy which is soft , still , peaceable , serene , which has no mixture or alloy ; of which there is no excess , but the more it is felt , the more perfect and refined it grows , the more content and satisfaction it yields through the whole of life .

		To the first of these a thousand things are necessary , a thousand outward and casual circumstances concurring , the least of which being removed , or ceasing , it also must cease .

		To the second there is nothing necessary but what depends upon ourselves . ''

		It adds much to the weight of
Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	's counsels to know that he practised what he preached , so far as we can learn from his con - temporaries ; and thus his lumbering periods make an impression where a
Seneca	LOCATION	's rhetorical flights of would-be stoicism fail to convince . ''

		Perhaps no modern , '' writes
Toland	PERSON	in his introduction to the Shaftesbury letters , '' ever turned the ancients more into sap and blood , as they say , than he .

		Their doctrines he un - derstood as well as themselves , and their vir - tues he practised better . '' ''

		Just as
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	was ' God-intoxicated , ' '' says the Earl 's latest editor , '' so Shaftesbury was * intoxicated with the idea of virtue . '

		He is the greatest Stoic of modern times .

		Into his own life he wrought the stoical virtue for virtue 's sake .

		This ex - alted purpose he sought to attain by means of I this Regimen ... The Greek slave , the Ro - man emperor , and the English nobleman must tcuorary .

		Lord Shaftesbury 's influence on the men of his time was considerable .

		Voltaire calls him the boldest of English philosophers perhaps questionable praise and Diderot 's '' Essai sur le Merite et la Vertu '' is a free translation of the
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's `` Inquiry concerning Virtue . ''

		He enjoyed the friendship of
Locke	LOCATION	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Lord Somers	PERSON	,
Lord Halifax	LOCATION	, and many others eminent either in literature or in public affairs .

		His reputation as a free-thinker hurt him in some quarters , but his wholesome influence for liberality of thought and freedom of inquiry could not have been other than widespread .

		The letters , with which the volume closes , though they have not the charm of the great letter-writers , are yet interesting reading .

		Their formality and stately courtesy even his own mother he always addresses as '' your ladyship '' are characteristic of the period , but a little chilling to the reader , and a little tiresome .

		A book , Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	declares , should help us to enjoy life or to endure it .

		This note - worthy contribution to the literature of stoicism is well fitted for the latter purpose , nor , we believe , will its perusal entirely fail of accom - plishing the former .

		HOMER IN THE VULGAR TONGUE .

		* The adequate translation of Homer is doubt - less the most imperative task set , for the clas - sical scholar , in the interests of general culture .

		Very few men can ever have , and even fewer can retain , an accurate knowledge of the Greek poem .

		Indeed the specialist himself reaches only one certainty : that he does not possess , and can never restore , the original text .

		The Homeric vocabulary is very large , and the meanings of many words are merely surmised , or are still fought over .

		Yet in the history of poetry , in mythology , even in socio - logical and ethnological studies , the Iliad and Odyssey must always be of peculiar and unique importance .

		They are the first chapters in the history of European culture .

		We should have an interpretation , and a comment , by a syndi - cate of scholars , which would have for the layman such authority as the Revised Version now enjoys .

		* THE ODYSSEY .

		Rendered into English Prose by
Samuel Butler	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present reviewer believes firmly that the poetic tone and spirit , and also the unit of the line or verse , are indispensable elements in every great poem .

		Hence
Longfellow 's Dante	ORGANIZATION	, which attempts to preserve both , is a better-directed effort than Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's ver - sion , which wholly abandons the metrical form .


Voss	PERSON	's line-for-line German version of Iliad and
Odyssey	ORGANIZATION	is almost ideal .

		But the general voice of our generation seems adverse to all this .

		The translation of Homer probably best-known in
America	LOCATION	is still the dignified , musical , rather slow work of the poet
Bryant	PERSON	's old age .

		To the eye his rendering is `` blank verse , '' and the ten-syllable line is quite too short to express the average contents of an Homeric hexameter .

		For the ear this verse has no well-defined close , and is indeed often plain prose .

		Furthermore , the most notable recent renderings have been avowedly prosaic .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	and his partners still retained an archaic flavor , and somewhat elevated diction .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	descended to the simplest and most direct forms of contemporary English .

		Mr.
Samuel Butler	PERSON	has taken a much longer stride down the same slope .

		He has deliberately emptied each phrase of all noble allusiveness or charm , and gives us the blunt fact in vulgar colloquial words .

		We do not think he would himself quarrel with this statement .

		A typical instance is Odyssey , Book V. , vss .

		1545 , with its inimitable antithesis .

		Bryant indicates the contrast poetically , though he does not attempt the artistic repetition of the last word : `` Night after night He slept constrained within the hollow cave , The unwilling by the fond . ''

		Butcher and
Lang	PERSON	rise to the occasion , and expanding slightly give us : '' Howsoever by night he would sleep by her , as needs he must , in the hollow caves , unwilling lover by a will - ing lady . ''

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has a similar render - ing .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	offers us : '' He had got tired of
Calypso	LOCATION	, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night , it w.as she , not he , would have it so . ''

		Words like '' hurry - skurry ing , '' phrases like '' There is no account - ing for luck , '' were never meant to suggest poetry .

		The clearest note , perhaps , is struck at II .

		20 , where Antiphos , a companion of Odysseus , is mentioned . ''

		The savage Cyclops killed him in the cave , and on him made a supper last of all , '' says Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	.

		There may be a bit of tragic irony here , in that poor
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		71 Antiphos just failed to escape with the rest of the crew .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	actually makes it read that the Cyclops '' cooked his -LRB- Antiphos ' -RRB- last meal for him , '' and comments thus : '' So we vulgarly say ' had cooked his goose ' or ' had settled his hash . ' ''

		If this is the mature result of literal prose translation , let us by all means '' hurry-skurry '' back to Pope , with his deftly - managed clattering pair of stilts !

		It is fair to say that this well-printed version seems based on competent study of Greek , is as a rule carefully and faithfully done , and in the notes the translator shows personal famil - iarity with
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands .

		The discussion of passages borrowed more or less awkwardly from the
Iliad	LOCATION	into the younger poem is often acute and stimulating , though it is startling to hear this spoken of as a newly-discovered or unworked vein of scholarship .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	announces this translation as a supplement to his '' The Authoress of the Odyssey , '' published in
1897	DATE	.

		This was an attempt to demonstrate that the Odyssey was written by a girl , who lived at
Trapani	ORGANIZATION	on the west coast of
Sicily	LOCATION	, that all Odysseus ' adven - tures really amounted to a mere circumnaviga - tion of that island : and that the authoress has put in
Nausicaa	LOCATION	as a flattering portrait of herself .

		He announces in the preface to the present volume that no serious criticism of these theses has reached him , and yet he by no means thinks that '' scholars generally acquiesce in '' his conclusions .

		Both these latter statements are doubtless true , and will probably remain no less so .

		Even the inventor himself , at least in this book , keeps up the dis - cussion in a rather bantering spirit , calling at - tention to feminine inconsistency , girlish shy - ness and ignorance , etc. , in the Odyssean passages which seem to make for his novel and air-spun theory .

		Facing p. 72 are two photographic views of
S. Cusumano	PERSON	's salt-works , a sort of dyke on the flat Sicilian shore .

		The former tidal inlet , now silted up , is , it seems , the original for the beautiful river into which
Ulysses	PERSON	swam , to land safely on the Scherian shore .

		But the same place was introduced , it further appears , in three other sets of passages in the Odyssey , as -LRB- 1 -RRB- the harbor of Rheithron in
Ithaca	LOCATION	, -LRB- 2 -RRB- the place where Ulysses landed in
Ithaca	LOCATION	, -LRB- 3 -RRB- the place where Telemachus landed in
Ithaca	LOCATION	.

		All these shrivel to a little muddy silted-up Sicilian tideway : ex uno disce omnia .

		A POETIC DRAMA .

		* Critics are very apt to object strongly to what they call `` closet plays . ''

		They some - times call them '' literary dramas , '' but that name is not a very good one , for it seems to deny the literary element in many dramas which are meant for the stage and very well suited to it .

		By whatever name called , how - ever , the theatrical critic looks askance on the drama written by a man who writes because he wants to , even though he sees no particular chance of having his play presented .

		A recent writer deplores the '' literary drama '' and the fascination it had for the great English poets of the nineteenth century : he says it has a para - lysing effect , although it is not clear upon whom .

		The critic , however , who is more apt to read plays than to see them , may well wonder at such a view .

		We have , for instance , among other books , '' Ghost of Rosalys '' by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		We should regret to regard it as something not worth doing , something of a paralysing effect .

		Indeed it was worth doing and it has no such effect .

		Some closet plays , doubtless , are really very bad : when the poet divorces himself from all possibility of stage presentation , he perhaps feels a lack of restraint that is demoralizing .

		But after all it can hardly be a certainty with any play that it will not be presented . ''

		Faust '' has been presented many times ; the second part as well as the first . ''

		Manfred '' has been often presented , and that very effectively . ''

		Brand '' has been given a number of times .

		Almost anything can be presented if there are people who wish to pre - sent it .

		It is true that when presented , it may not be successful , for there may not be anyone that wants to see it .

		But then , such is the case with some plays written expressly for the stage .

		There is really no very strict criterion of a closet play .

		The only condition -LRB- and a simple one it is -RRB- is that the writer shall have before him the absolute impossibility of stage presen - tation .

		Such was the case , probably , with
Shelley	PERSON	in writing `` Prometheus Unbound '' ; possibly with
Swinburne	PERSON	in ''
Atalanta	LOCATION	in Calydon . ''

		But the greater number of what are generally thought of as literary dramas are plays that one can imagine on the stage .

		We can imagine Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's play on the stage : indeed , we have done so with pleasure .

		The * GHOST OF ROSALYS : A Play .

		By
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	: Printed for the Author .

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, fact that an audience of our day might not much care to see it , if it were presented , has little * to do with the matter .

		An audience of our day would not care for many of Shake - speare 's plays , nor did the audience for which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays were originally written care for them more than they did for a good many other plays now forgotten save by readers .

		The test of a closet play can not go much far - ther than has been indicated : if the writer has had a general view to stage conditions , then it is not a closet play that he writes , no matter how literary it may be and no matter how little '' stage technique '' it may have .

		Stage tech - nique may be needful for a successful presen - tation , just as types and ink are needed to make a book .

		But both are trivial matters , as is clear when we think how little stage technique avails Massinger ,
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	,
Robert	PERSON	- son to-day , just about as little and as much as types and ink .

		That a play is not written expressly for the stage , that it is not meant for immediate per - formance , that it has not been presented any - where , these things , then , are not reasons why we may not have something very good .

		The fact of a successful stage presentation is nothing in favor of a play nowadays ; it should , on the other hand , warn us against a play .

		If we hear that a play has been successfully pre - sented , the chances are that it is a bad play .

		`` Cyrano de Bergerac '' succeeded , but so did '' The Christian , '' and more plays are like the latter than like the former .

		Hence , we may read with pleasure if we like poetry several plays which have been of late published by American writers .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's `` Masque of Judgment , '' Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's `` The Aztec God , '' Mrs. Fields 's '' Orpheus , '' Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's play which we have mentioned , with these books we have a pos - sibility of finding something charming and at - tractive , that is lacking when we read Mr.
Fitch	PERSON	's ''
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	'' or Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's ''
Arizona	LOCATION	. ''

		These latter plays have already charmed and attracted in the way for which they were intended ; as books they are like pressed flowers that have no sentimental asso - ciations .

		After all aside from the possibility of a closet play why should a poet not put his ideas in dramatic form ?

		It is surely a con - venience , in that it enables him , if he wishes , to present certain essential dramatic elements and to omit a great many other elements of which he does not feel the need .

		The dramatic form allows one to hold the attention close to the development of the idea without the dis - traction of description or comment .

		It has its drawbacks in return for these advantages , but used with proper regard for its proper charac - teristics the drama is undoubtedly a powerful literary form as well as a valuable theatrical attraction .

		This play of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's was presumably not written for the stage , but it is not a play in which the author has neglected theoretical possibilities .

		Whether it could be successfully presented is neither here nor there ; it could be presented , undoubtedly , if there were enough persons who wished to present it , and it would be successful if enough persons were found who wished to see it .

		And as this is about all that one could say of any play which had not yet made its appearance on the stage , we may therefore neglect the question of presentation until the play is performed .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has written his play almost en - tirely in verse , which is not a very common thing just now ; in verse which though occa - sionally rough , is yet sustained with unflagging vitality and spirit , and which by its flowing movement and its adaptive character carries the reader along with it .

		He puts aside the stillness of a uniform .

		metre , and as one scene changes to another we find the rhythm varying harmoniously with the thought .

		In some places he is less fortunate than in others , but on the whole the device is eminently successful .

		And although the question of the stage be dismissed , it may be allowable to point out , not so much that the stage of our day loses something by practically excluding verse -LRB-
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeter	PERSON	- linck ,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	,

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's verse may be read aloud with pleasure -LRB- indeed , should be -RRB- , although here and there it is not so fer - vent as elsewhere .

		It is a romantic drama .

		That might be inferred from the adaptive rhythms and the rhymes .

		The clear definiteness of our English blank verse gives somewhat the effect of the marble material of a statue , unless it be so much broken up as to become merely pulsating prose .

		Romantic in form it is and also romantic in general treatment , that is , its main idea is pre - sented not definitely and simply , but with an exuberance of accessory figure and ornament that often rather veils the idea than presents

		Still , the main figures are striking : Joyeux the imaginative , and his three coadjutors , the scientist , the priest , the poet .

		These last are not presented with a firm enough conception of character to vitalize them everywhere , but they serve what is perhaps their chief purpose , to carry us to the end of the first and long - est act and give us the idea that is to be devel - oped .

		The imagination has its ideal , which is to be realized in love and at the point of reali - zation vanishes away .

		Rosalys dies and Joyeux is , for the time , led away by witch will o ' the wisps .

		But in the last act he revives his old - time love ; Rosalys rises for a brief half hour , and when she again passes away he goes with her .

		Presumably Mr.
Moore	PERSON	had not definitely in mind more than to create certain passionate figures and to embody a poetic feeling .

		Im - plicit in such presentation is , however , an idea , or perhaps we should not call it more than a sentiment .

		Our attention is aroused and held by the ideas that gather in our minds around this figure of the imaginative man and his effort to ` give form to his imaginings , his strivings with the impossible , his deception at the hands of vulgar cheats .

		But whither does all tend ?

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	does not seem to have his problem clearly in mind .

		At least we find no real solution .

		But no play should be judged as an allegory unless it be frankly conceived as such .

		This play is not : it presents to us romantic figures , which do something to arouse ideas in our mind as all figures must .

		But it is better merely to take the people as people and to lose oneself in the story of emotion and exaltation , and to be content with an adumbration here and there of the wider meaning beyond .

		We do not , ourselves , fully appreciate the full pur - port of the third act .

		But the poetry of the first act especially , and of the last , carried us well along over whatever did not make its appeal .

		To write a play and in verse is rather a daring thing although now there are a num - ber to keep one in countenance but Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has come well through all dangers with his venture .

		MR.
RICHARD MANSFIELD	PERSON	'S acting version of ''
King Henry V.	PERSON	, '' as lately produced with marked success , is published in a most attractively-printed volume by Messrs.
McClnre	PERSON	,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An Introduction by Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	, some notes on the heraldry of the play , and two photogravure illustrations , are included .

		SOME RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL .

		* As in this age more people travel , and travel more often , and to more distant places , books of travel must correspondingly increase .

		But the more be-travelled our sphere the less be - comes the opportunity for a really new book dealing with the previously unknown and tell - ing of strange men and beasts .

		All the books in our present group treat of parts of the earth more or less familiar from the writings of pre - vious travellers ; yet these books have all of them a certain raison d'etre , either in the personality of the writer , the timeliness of the subject , or the general utility of the whole work .

		Mr.
G. W. James	PERSON	's hand-book to that won - derful region , '' In and around the Grand Canyon , '' comes largely under the last head . ''

		A canyon , '' says the author , '' Is not a deep , narrow , gloomy gorge , into which the sun fails to shine even at midday .

		It is , in reality , a series of canyons one within and below the other .

		Pic - ture one canyon , a thousand feet deep and ten or twelve miles across ; below this , another canyon , but two miles less in width and a thousand feet deeper than number one ; then still another , two thousand feet deeper and four miles narrower , followed by yet another , deeper still and more miles narrower , until the inner gorge of granite is reached , through which the roaring river flows , and you will have a better idea than ever before . ''

		This describes the Grand Canyon , but many canyons are by Mr.
James	PERSON	's own account nar - row and gloomy .

		After a general description of the
Colorado	LOCATION	region and some historical chapters , Mr.
James	PERSON	takes up the Grand Can - yon and its tributaries in detail .

		He regards the Bridal Veil Falls in the
Havasu	LOCATION	as the `` Most exquisitely beautiful waterfall in the world .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, There is nothing in the Yosemite that , for rich delicacy of beauty and rare combination of charms , can equal it .

		On the left and right are towering cliffs , two thousand feet high , of red sandstone .

		At your feet is rich green grass , and a delicate gauzy growth , as fine as asparagus grass , which covers the ground with fairy-like lace and makes a carpet fit for a '
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream ' dance .

		Above , just on the edge of the
fall	DATE	, are several trees , rich with their new dress of
spring	DATE	leaves , with the red mountains and azure sky , as richly blue as that of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	... Now , with such a back - ground , enjoy the fall Wa-Hath-peek-ha-ha . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	gives some account of the
Havasu	LOCATION	- pai Indians in the canyon district , and an in - tensely interesting narrative is given of Mr.
Bass	PERSON	's experiences in attempting to reach these Indians .

		The work is to be recommended to the general reader and to the tourist .

		The quotations are extensive , and the illustrations are numerous and excellent .

		Mr.
W. E. Curtis	PERSON	has collected his South American letters to the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Record '' into a volume which he entitles '' Between the Andes and the Ocean , '' describing all the west - ern countries from
Panama	LOCATION	to
Patagonia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	gives quite a full account of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal . ''

		The advocates of the
Panama	LOCATION	canal lay great stress upon the fact that it has a good harbor at either end , capable of receiving the largest ships , while the
Nica	ORGANIZATION	- ragua canal has none , and the two that must be built present serious engineering difficulties ; that a good railroad is now in operation along the entire route of the
Panama	LOCATION	canal , while one will have to be constructed in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	; that the supreme difficulties of the Pan - ama route have already been developed and overcome , while those of the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	route are unknown ; that nothing of an experimental character is proposed on the
Panama	LOCATION	canal , while several projects in the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	scheme involve elements of novelty that are without precedent ; that the length of the
Panama	LOCATION	canal is only forty-six miles , while that of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	is four times as great ; that there are no volcanos on the isthmus , while there are several in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	; that earthquakes are practically unknown here , while in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	they are frequent ; that the concession from the government of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	for the
Panama	LOCATION	canal is complete and satis - factory and there is only one nation to deal with , while two nations must be consulted in everything that in - volves the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	canal , and the concessions are complicated with conditions that are likely to prove embarrassing . ''

		There is some historical matter in Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's book , but the main topic treated is the indus - trial , social , and political life of the people .

		The volume forms , on the whole , a very read - able description of the
Western South America	LOCATION	of to-day .

		There are a number of illustrations and a fair index , but no map . ''

		A Summer Journey to
Brazil	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Alice R. Humphrey	PERSON	, is a brief and pleasant record of a trip to
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	,
Pernambuco	LOCATION	,
Bahia	LOCATION	,
Petropolis Sanctos	LOCATION	, and
Sao Paolo	LOCATION	.

		The author has some sharp criticism for the
U. S.	ORGANIZATION	consular service at Sanctos , and her chapter on this subject ends with this quota - tion from a letter written by an American in
Sao Paolo	LOCATION	, dated
July 6 , 1900	DATE	: '' What does our government mean by sending out an Italian Priest as Consul to Santos ?

		If he were only a priest who had practically withdrawn from active functions , it would not be so bad ; but this one makes it his first duty to visit the newspapers and declare that he will not allow the duties of the consulate to interfere with his higher ecclesiastical functions , and as a proof of this , he left the duties of the office yesterday and came up to say a thirtieth day Mass for the soul of a person connected with the Diario Popular , ' and had it advertised far and near . ''

		As far as it goes the book is a useful and read - able sketch , and contains a number of appen - dices of value .

		Under the title '' The Paradise of the
Pa	ORGANIZATION	- cific '' Mr.
G. Waldo Browne	PERSON	gives us a short general account of the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	.

		The volume includes a description of the islands , a resume of their history , with special chapters on the religious history , and an account of the present status .

		The condition of the Japanese and Chinese have particular mention . ''

		The Japanese appear to be the disturbing factor in the islands at present .

		There are many educated and intelligent Japanese on the islands , who are prominent in business and have thrifty homes , but the class most largely drawn hither is ignorant , impetuous , and hard to control .

		If industrious they are ambitious , and , see - ing better than the Chinese the real inwardness of their situation , are dissatisfied with it , waiting , watching for the opportunity to strike a blow at the power which at - tempts to hold them in check .

		There is too much of the Yankee about them to be held long in surveillance , and , with their high percentage of population , what the outcome is to be is hard to forecast , though probably no cause for serious alarm . ''

		The book is popular in tone and profusely illustrated .

		A companion volume to the book just noticed bears the rather fanciful title '' The Pearl of the Orient . ''

		It is a brief compilation of mat - ter relating to the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, and while popular in tone is fairly accurate on matters of fact .

		There are chapters on the geography and history of the islands , on the animals , on the resources , and the volume closes with a chapter on ''
America	LOCATION	in the Orient . ''

		The bola or native knife is thus described : '' The most common type used in warfare is between two and three feet in length , including the handle , and has a wide , thick blade edged like a guillotine .

		When wielded by a fanatic Philippine in the heat of battle , it is a formidable instrument of death , which is capable of cutting a human head clear from its seat at a single
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 blow , split the body from shoulder to hip , or cleave the skull in twain .

		At the call to charge , these native troops discard all other weapons and
spring	DATE	to the wild attack hand to hand , wielding the bola with terrible effect . ''

		The illustrations are profuse and well-printed .

		In Miss
Christine Collbran	PERSON	's account of '' An American Girl 's Trip to the Orient and around the World '' we have the fresh impressions of a young person conveyed pleasantly enough in a very familiar epistolary style .

		One amusing incident the author thus describes : '' While out walking I met a sort of procession , marching down one of the streets of
Yokohama	LOCATION	, which amused me immensely .

		It consisted of fifteen or twenty men carrying long poles with white banners fastened to them , or with a mock rooster perched on the top , fol - lowed by a brass band of about eight instruments , play - ing , or rather trying to play , ' Marching through
Georgia	LOCATION	. '

		Each man seemed to be playing just as he felt , and their laudable endeavors to express their dif - ferent moods in different keys was not all that could be desired from a musical point of view .

		Apparently , it did not matter in the least if he were a few notes too high , or too low , or if he were playing faster or slower than the rest ; so taking it altogether , I was only just able to recognize our good old campaigners ' song .

		The Japanese , themselves , seemed to be enjoying it thor - oughly , if we may judge by the crowds that followed in the wake of this comical band . ''

		The bulk of the book is given to
Japan	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	, other countries receiving but very meager notice . ''

		Among the Berbers of
Algeria	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Anthony Wilkin	PERSON	, is `` a popular record of a journey undertaken with scientific objects . ''

		These objects were of an archaeological and anthropological nature , the special purpose being '' to trace if possible their -LSB- the Berbers ' -RSB- connection with the most ancient races of
Egypt	LOCATION	by the methods of anthropology , by col - lections of pottery , of designs , of physical measurements , and by observation of their everyday occupations , and of the monuments of their ancestors . ''

		This object the author achieved .

		The Berbers , unconquered by Roman or Arab , but at length subjugated by the French , are divided into two tribes , the
Chawia	LOCATION	and
Kabylia	LOCATION	, both of which were visited by our author .

		He finds the Berber has many good traits . ''

		Whether in the olive-clad mountains of
Kabylia	LOCATION	or the terraces of their Aurasian fastnesses they are white men and in general act like white men .

		Among them the virtues of honesty , hospitality , and good - nature are conspicuous .

		It is not their misfortune alone that the lowlands know them no more ; not their misfortune only that
Mohammedanism	PERSON	has debarred them from entering , as they would otherwise have en - tered , on the path of European progress and liberality : it is the misfortune of the whole civilized world .

		De - scendants of a mighty race whose culture once spread from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the Red Sea and the Hanran from
Crete	LOCATION	to Timbuctoo and the Soudan , there are still to be found among them the vestiges of the arts and sciences , of the spirit of conquest , of the capacity for self-government , which , if developed , would make them again a great nation . ''

		The book is of interest and value as giving us some acquaintance with this little-known race .

		The illustrations are exceptionally fine .

		A pleasant account of that most remote of the British Isles ,
St. Kilda	LOCATION	, is prepared by Mr.
Norman Heathcote	PERSON	.

		This '' last of the sea-girt Hebrides '' is famed in
Britain	LOCATION	for its uncouth natives and for its multitude of sea-birds .

		The author presents a brief history of
St. Kilda	LOCATION	, followed by chapters on the island as it is to-day , boating and climbing experiences , the birds , and the '' St.
Kilda	PERSON	of the future . ''

		A curious habit of the Fulmar Petrel is thus described '' : '' On the approach of an enemy , the fulmar squirts oil at him in self-defense .

		I suppose the operation is of use to them against some of their foes ; and though it does not avail them against the St.
Kildan	PERSON	fowler , it is on record that one gallant fulmar succeeded in killing a man by this same process .

		It was not in
St. Kilda	LOCATION	, and it was some time ago .

		The said man , being unacquainted with this little habit of the petrel tribe , was so astonished at receiving a stream of nasty-smelling oil in his face that he fell off the ladder , by means of which he bad obtained access to the nest , and was killed .

		My experience is , that it is a very poor sort of weapon , as the range is so short .

		I doubt if the stream of oil will carry more than a couple of feet on the level . ''

		The illustrations are good , and the author 's map is probably the best yet made .

		Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	's '' Spanish High - ways and Byways '' is the vivacious account of a tour along the regular routes , the only '' Byway '' being a trip through the Basque provinces .

		The author 's impression of the Spaniard is that he is not only not lazy , as often reputed , but intensely active .

		She gives a graphic picture of a Spanish Carnival . ''

		Squeaking and gibbering , the maskers , unrebnked , took all manner of saucy liberties .

		A stately old gen - tleman rose from his cushion in a crested carriage to observe how gallantly a bevy of ladies were beating off with a hail of confetti and bonbons an imploring cav - alier who ran by their wheels , and when he would have resumed his seat he found himself dandled on the knees of a grinning Chinaman .

		Sometimes a swarm of maskers would beset a favorite carriage , climbing up beside the coachman and snatching his reins , stand - ing on the steps and throwing kisses , lying along the back and twitting the proudest beauty in the ear or making love to the haughtiest .

		This all-licensed masker , with his monstrous disguise and affected squeal , may be a duke or a doorkeeper .

		Carnival is democracy . ''

		The book contains a pleasant chapter on the gypsies , and one of some length on the Choral games of Spanish children , a disquisition which 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, should be of interest to the psedologist .

		The illustrations are good , but there is neither map nor index .

		An enthusiastic , vivacious description of Falaise and its environs by an intimate friend and observer , may be found in Mrs.
Anna Bowmon Dodd	PERSON	's volume entitled '' Falaise , the Town of the Conqueror . ''

		The effect of Nor - mandy landscape is thus described : '' Little by little , the subtle and satisfying charm of this
Normandy	LOCATION	landscape was producing an effect not wholly new to me , at least .

		So penetrating have I felt this charm to be , that in just such
Normandy	LOCATION	scenes , and just such warm , balmy days , I have had that rarest of human sensations , a satisfied , completed sense of perfect enjoyment .

		The man or woman who loves nature , sanely , can be made more entirely con - tent , I believe , in the rich inland parts of this marvelous
Normandy	LOCATION	province than in any other country . ''

		The author visited the Falaise Fair in a char - a-banc , and in brisk style she narrates the scenes there witnessed .

		A large portion of the volume concerns the history of the city .

		We have rarely seen better photographic illus - trations than those which adorn this book . ''

		Forbidden Paths in the Land of Og '' is the narrative of a trip by three missionaries into the region beyond
Jordan	PERSON	.

		Their expe - dition was to the west and north of the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	and included visits to
Golan	LOCATION	,
Gadara	LOCATION	,
Mizpah	LOCATION	, and
Jerash	LOCATION	.

		Of the latter place , where are found the ruins of the ancient and magnificent
Gerasa	PERSON	, the account is quite full and interesting . ''

		A Greek theatre of the ancient type forms a capital camping-place for modern travellers .

		Historically it awakens myriad thoughts of regal splendor and
Chris	PERSON	- tian martyrdom .

		Practically it lends itself to the real necessities of the tourists in affording shade and shelter , semi-seclusion , and excellent stabling for the ani - mals .

		Incongruous as this may sound , a grand theatre reduced to the level of tourists ' conveniences , yet so it was .

		Camp was pitched in the midst of the open arena .

		Round about on three sides rose the semi - circle of stone benches , in sixteen tiers , one above another , capable of seating three or four thousand spectators . ''

		The book is full of Biblical allusions , and should be of especial use to
Bible	LOCATION	students .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		MR.
W. GARRETT	PERSON	BORDER 'S '' Treasury of American Sacred Song '' is reissued , in an enlarged edition , by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Something like thirty new poems are included , but the price of the volume has been re - duced .

		The editor gives a broad meaning to the word '' sacred , '' and this admirable book is far more than a mere collection of hymns .

		In fact , hymns are rather far to seek in these pages .

		WAR AND POLITICS ix SOUTH
AFRICA	LOCATION	.

		* The wish is father to the thought in nearly all recent books which treat of the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Two of the group before us are from American hands , and attempt to give both sides of the ques - tions involved .

		Several , from English pens , are interested only in disclosing what their authors saw .

		The rest are more or less partial to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, reflecting the attitude to be expected when war ex - cites a nation .

		The pamphlet from
M. Edmond Desmolins	PERSON	, au - thor of `` Anglo-Saxon Superiority , '' entitled ''
Boers	PERSON	or English : Who Are in the Right ? ''

		is an argu - ment against the rights of a weaker people to na - tional existence , with such qualification as can be given that unpleasant theme by statements such as this : `` These great nations must understand that their preeminence is based solely on the fact that they are , for the time being , the most worthy to exercise it , '' a complete confusion , - it will be noted , of might and right . ''

		The British Case Against the Boer Republics '' is a small document prepared by the
Imperial South African Association	ORGANIZATION	, chief agent of the

		THE DIAL 77 initiation of the South African Republics .

		It is purely ex parte , and makes no other pretension .

		Mr.
Evelyn Cecil	PERSON	is a nephew of the
Marquis of Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	and a member of parliament .

		He arrived at
Cape Town	LOCATION	less than a month before the war broke oat , and stayed in
South Africa	LOCATION	for three months and a half afterward .

		The opening words of his book , '' If
England	LOCATION	fights she will create for herself a sullen dependency among the Dutch in
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' spoken to the author upon his arrival at the
Cape	LOCATION	, seem to be most nearly prophetic of any of the statements in the volume , which deals with the British side entirely .

		Some remarks on the administration of
Rhodesia	LOCATION	are worth reading , as evidence that the
Transvaal	LOCATION	was brought to bay for doing the very things which the Chartered Company did in a much more extortion - ate degree .

		Just such another book as the foregoing , mak - ing necessary allowances for sex and education , is Miss
Violet R. Markham	PERSON	's ''
South Africa	LOCATION	, Past and Present . ''

		The larger part of the work , how - ever , is a rewriting of the history of the land , with a chapter on `` Industrial
Johannesburg	LOCATION	'' supplied by the author 's brother , Mr.
Arthur Markham	PERSON	.

		The portly volume requires no extended notice at this time , containing as it does the usual record of mismanagement and race hatred , fostered by mu - tual misunderstandings and thoughtless oppor - tunism .

		One of the best of the books resulting from the war in
Cuba	LOCATION	was written by Captain
George Clarke	PERSON	Mas - grave , whose new volume , '' In
South Africa	LOCATION	with
Buller	PERSON	, '' contains a vivid account of that doughty warrior 's advances and retreats .

		It is a violently partisan work , addressed to Americans in a par - ticular sense , even to the point of quoting Mr.
John Hays Hammond	PERSON	, a paid attorney of the
Johannes	PERSON	- burg mine owners , as an authority , along with a number of other Americans with foreign names who wish to see
England	LOCATION	reduce taxation .

		The book makes no pretension to literary graces , but its narrative of the fighting can hardly fail to interest .

		Another former Cuban correspondent is Mr.
John Black Atkins	PERSON	, whose letters to the Manchester `` Guardian '' have been collected , so far as they are pertinent , into a volume entitled `` The Relief of Ladysmith . ''

		The story of the repeated attempts to bear succor to the people of that sadly beleagnred ' and gallant little town is told in Mr.
Atkins	PERSON	's best style , with great good humor , though with a full setting forth of the difficulties met and surmounted .

		Dr.
E. Oliver Ashe	PERSON	was a surgeon in the hospital at
Kimberly	PERSON	daring the siege , and his '' Besieged by the Boers '' is a picturesque account of events in that monopolistic town for several months , mottled with paragraphs that reflect the deadly dullness of the long isolation .

		Dr.
Ashe	PERSON	's vivid pages tell a story worth telling , and tell it well .

		The two books of Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	, ``
London	LOCATION	to Ladysmith via
Pretoria	LOCATION	'' and ``
Ian Hamilton	PERSON	's
March	DATE	, '' form a continuous narrative of the author 's numerous adventures and narrow es - capes , from the beginning of the war to the capture of
Pretoria	LOCATION	.

		The inclusion of the diary of
Lieuten	PERSON	- ant
Frankland	PERSON	, an officer in the unfortunate
Dublin Fusileers	ORGANIZATION	, carries on the tale of the prisoners at
Pretoria	LOCATION	from the time of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's escape until his return to that city with the British column .

		It is not necessary here to praise Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's methods of presenting his facts .

		He is writing in the field and his letters appear in a
London	LOCATION	paper before they are printed in book form ; but it is doubtful if any revision or care could give them the air of reality they now convey .

		Mr.
Howard C. Hillegas	PERSON	is an American who has been attached to the Republican side in the South African struggle .

		His account of '' The Boers in War '' pays a high tribute to the men who compose the burgher armies , and the manner in which they go about their battles .

		He bears witness to the smallness of the force which they have been able to put in the field , such forces never exceeding thirty thousand men at any time , and his descrip - tion of what might be called the '' elective system '' of fighting makes it still more surprising that their successes should have been what they are .

		Though his sympathies are evidently with the Dutch , Mr.
Hillegas	PERSON	is wholly free from rancor , as was evi - denced in his former book .

		The psychological study of a man changing his mind adds to the value of Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's '' With Both Armies in
South Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		It is evident from the narrative that Mr.
Davis	PERSON	had been so thoroughly persuaded the burghers were as black as the British had painted them that his discovery of the exaggeration caused a total over - throw of all his pre-judgments , leaving him as violently partisan as before , though on the other side .

		His testimony that the Englishman is a bad loser can be matched by an abundance of examples collected from exclusively British sources since the outbreak of hostilities , and the hearty dislike his frankness has caused in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is some wit - ness to the accuracy of his comment .

		Mr.
Spencer Wilkinson	PERSON	's volume of '' Lessons of the War '' is merely a reprint of his weekly reviews in '' The

		His statement that no power will intervene unless it is prepared for war still awaits complete demon - stration .

		Another similar volume will contain more and riper decisions .

Earl of Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	does not save Mr.

		Arnold-Forster 's '' The War Office , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and the Empire '' from being too sanguine a work in its belief that strictures on the blunders of those who control the machinery of the British army will result in reform .

John Bigelow	PERSON	,
U.S.A.	LOCATION	, in
1899	DATE	, concerning the authorities at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	states the case against him - self with entire fairness in the preface to his '' The Great Boer War . ''

		He wrote the somewhat bulky volume partly in
England	LOCATION	and partly on the steamer in passage , finishing it in
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	while pro- fessionally engaged during the epidemic among the wounded soldiers there . ''

		Often , '' he says , '' the only documents which I had to consult were the wounded officers and men who were under our care . ''

		Elsewhere he speaks of the volume being '' compiled with as much accuracy as is attainable at this date . ''

		But the history , such as it is , has commanded the highest praise in
England	LOCATION	, and it seems to be designed exclusively for British con - sumption .

		Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	means to be impartial , and there are frequent evidences of his efforts to that end .

		He brings to the book , too , a personal knowl - edge of the South African landscape and general geography , in addition to his well known skill as a writer . ''

Transvaal	LOCATION	has been omitted , making it a treasure house for the opponents of the Republics .

		But even here the silence of the authors respecting the
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	admits away a part of their contention .

		Dr.
Farrelly	PERSON	looks for a period of duress as a Crown colony for the

O'Connell	PERSON	, the Irish Liberator .

		The
Daniel O'Connell	PERSON	of Mr.
Robert Dunlop	PERSON	's presentation , in the '' He - roes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , is a genuine Irishman , somewhat unduly spiritualized it may be , yet typical of his race .

		Mercurial in temperament , quick to take offense and quick to forgive , easily quarrelsome over triv - ialities , he is still the foremost figure in the long list of the Irish agitators of the earlier part of the century .


O'Connell	PERSON	was a leader of the Irish bar , an eloquent orator , and an effective member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, but it is upon his abilities as an organ - izer of political societies for the redress of
Ireland	LOCATION	's grievances that Mr.
Dunlop	PERSON	justly places the greatest stress .

		He excelled his contemporaries in his ability legally to evade repressive laws , and he stood far above every other agitator of the period in his de - termination never to encourage violent methods for the repeal of obnoxious statutes .

		O'Connell always advocated '' constitutional '' agitation .

		Mon - ster petitions , public meetings , and far-reaching political associations were the instruments he chose to express
Ireland	LOCATION	's sentiments , in the hope that incessant iteration would ensure fair treatment for his countrymen .

		Revolution was hateful to him .

		Neither personal persecution , nor discouragement at the seeming failure of wisely conceived projects , moved him , for an instant , from his horror of in - surrectionary methods .

		Mr.
Dunlop	PERSON	insists upon this again and again , for
O'Connell	PERSON	has frequently been credited with the will , but not with the courage , to embroil
Ireland	LOCATION	in civil war , and during his lifetime was generally regarded in
England	LOCATION	as hypocritical in his denunciation of armed resistance .

		Yet Mr.
Dunlop	PERSON	's estimate is sustained by numer - ous quotations from
O'Connell	PERSON	's personal letters to intimate friends , at every stage of his career .


O'Connell	PERSON	's character and acts were by no means above criticism , and the author does not attempt to conceal the defects .

		He was an egoist , yet perhaps purposely so in politics , recognizing the aptitude of his countrymen for submission to the political '' boss . ''

		He made serious mistakes in policy , as when he favored the disfranchisement of the forty shilling freeholders .

		He was often vulgar and abusive in language toward his political opponents .

		These failings are noted explicitly , though usually with toleration , by Mr.
Dunlop	PERSON	.

		Yet
Council	ORGANIZATION	's greatest mistake , in the author 's opinion , was one of judgment and not of character or measure , briefly , that his whole scheme of operations , though successful in securing Catholic emancipation , was based upon ideals , thus rendering complete success impossible .

		O'Connell believed that when once
England	LOCATION	was educated to understand the wrongs of the existing government of
Ireland	LOCATION	, the English sense of justice would force the righting of these wrongs .

		He therefore educated
England	LOCATION	by agi - tation in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dunlop	PERSON	asserts that
England	LOCATION	1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 An and LAfe .

		has never acted toward
Ireland	LOCATION	upon principles of abstract justice , and that selfish interest alone has brought any alleviation of Irish distress .

		Mere agitation of principles of right are here , therefore , always useless unless
England	LOCATION	sees her own direct benefit in their realization .

Dunlop	PERSON	is an Englishman .

		*
Richard Le Galuenne	PERSON	gives us a series of short essays written in the brilliant vein that holds attention if it does not always produce conviction .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	is a devotee of the religion of beauty , and in the fervor of his devotion he says , '' Why not disendow the Church , and en - dow Literature , which is really the coming Church ? ''

		His militant faith in the triumph of the finer in - stincts of the soul , love of beauty and desire for truth , and longing for the invisible things of the spirit , is abundantly in evidence , and especially so in the most important essay in the book , `` The Second Coming of the Ideal . ''

		He insists upon the reality of dreams , and declares that realism has failed because it does not understand , as does idealism , the science of human nature .

		Eager and earnest as are Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's convictions , he manages to give them publicity without too much parade of importance , dwelling upon them lovingly rather than strenuously , and even touching them lightly with a graceful fancy and a mild sort of wit .

		His treatment of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	has the charm of absolute sincerity of appreciation , and this paper more than any other makes us realize how much of our pleasure in the volume comes from the genuineness of his fresh delight in the aesthetic charm of books and men .

		But his enjoy - ment of
Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Theodore Watts-Dun	PERSON	ton , and
Miss Custance	PERSON	is balanced by the very positive irritation that comes to him from the great popular success of
Rndyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has chosen to make the clay jig , instead of compelling the marble to sing ; and he has his reward , '' he says , ^ A Propos The Absent-Minded Beggar , '' and .

		while we may not sympathize with his feeling of personal vexation , we must allow the criticism .

		On the whole , while there are some good things well said in the book , it is an entertaining rather than weighty or valuable contribution to the literary discussion of the problems of art and life .

		It might be suggested to Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	that his work is sufficiently pretentious to warrant his giving a little more attention to the writing of correct English .

		Especially is this desirable if he is to go forth to battle with Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	as one who degrades the national literature by the use of slang .

		A commendable Information in regard to memory is compendium a matter of general interest , and descriptions of the peculiarities and vagaries of the venerable mother of the muses may frequently be overheard in the small talk of culti - vated persons .

		Exact information in regard to the psychological status of the memory-processes is cer - tainly desirable ; and on the whole such information has kept pace with the increasing knowledge in regard to the physiological and psychological basis and mode of development of mental functions .

		Professor
Colegrove	PERSON	's inductive study of '' Memory '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is a well-designed aid to the student of this topic , and will appeal to the interests of the general reader .

		The scope of the volume includes an intro - ductory chapter giving the historical setting of opinions in regard to the nature of memory ; a suggestive account of the fluctuations of the memory - functions in the biological world ; some description of the diseases of memory , without which a con - ception of memory would be both misleading and inadequate ; a brief statement of the connection of memory-processes with the functions of the brain ; a discussion of the significant types , or classes of memory ; a detailed study , on the basis of an ex - tensively circulated question-sheet , of certain special problems in regard to the tenacity , accuracy , di - rection , unfoldment , relation to age , sex , race , etc. , and other characteristics of individual memories ; a discussion of the relations of the mere retentive functions to the assimilative ones , particularly to attention , apperception , and association ; and a concluding chapter rehearsing the pedagogical ap - plications of the main results of the previous studies .

		The volume is the outcome of a deep personal in - terest and of a special investigation of the subject .

		Its essential defect is the lack of a sustained hold upon the relations of the different parts of the subject to one another .

		We have a series of inci - dents , where we expect a continued story involving the same characters but in new situations .

		It is true of memory as of many problems psychological , that '' what was a problem once is a problem still '' ; but an interesting sketch of the shape which the problem assumes in response to the activities of modern research may be profitably gained from Dr.
Colegrove	PERSON	's handbook . ''

		The history of our navy under steam divides itself into two parts , rather sharply separated by a pe - culiar war-vessel forced into the field of action in advance of its natural time by the demands of a great war , and destined suddenly to change by its example the naval armaments and methods of all nations . ''

		This sentence indicates the underlying thought in '' The Monitor and the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	under Steam '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , by Lieut.
Frank M. Bennett	PERSON	, IT .

		S. N .

		The story of the origin and progress of steam navigation is told in a very interesting way , a number of drawings helping materially in giving the reader a correct understanding of the successive advance steps .

		A second chapter recounts the famous duel between the '' Monitor '' and the '' Merrimac , '' and this is followed by a description of other naval actions of the Civil War , the upper - most thought always being the evolution of the modern battle-ship .

		After the Civil War the
United	ORGANIZATION	The Monitor at an 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, States '' practically dropped out of sight for twenty years as a naval or maritime power , '' and European nations made the experiments and perfected the machinery necessary to the building of the battle - ship of to-day .

		This naval indifference was trying to American officers , and yet had its compensations , since we were able , when our '' new navy '' was planned , to profit by the expensive experience of the rest of the world .

		What the new navy accom - plished in the Spanish-American War of course is set forth in glowing words , nearly a hundred pages out of three hundred and fifty being given to the events of
1898	DATE	.

		This may perhaps be criticised as an undue proportion , but it is true that the story is designed to approach such a climax , all the thought and inventions of the past being represented at their best in such a vessel as the ''
Oregon	LOCATION	. ''

		The last chapter will be depended upon to sell the book , but it is likely that more real value attaches to the earlier pages , which show how naval inventors worked unceasingly at ideas tending to make the ships move faster than sails could carry them , and at the same time to make a more solid barrier for the flag at sea than was afforded by the '' wooden walls '' of the old navy .

		With the part in history played by the `` Constitution '' Americans have every reason to be satisfied .

		If she did not win her spurs a most terrestrial trope , in this connection during the Jbrief war with
France	LOCATION	, she did beat an English frigate sailing at that time , and
Preble	PERSON	gave her plenty to do against the Tripolitans soon after .

		It was in
1812	DATE	that the gallant ship blossomed into her fulness of fame , and Mr.

		Mr.
Paterson	PERSON	's object is to give a detailed narrative of the per - sonal life , aims , and motives of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, and he has hence abstained so far as may be from the usual historical and politico-philosophical excursions which his theme suggests .

		His book , in short , is a good plain narrative of
Oliver	PERSON	's career , and a sen - sible , unexaggerated view of his character .

England	LOCATION	was the so-called '' Forward Policy '' in
India	LOCATION	, and whether the
Afridi	PERSON	war was a logical result of that policy .

		Under the guise of a personal memoir , Mr.
Richard I. Bruce	PERSON	, a former political agent in
Beluchistan	LOCATION	, has written a book of comment upon English action in
India	LOCATION	. ''

		The Forward Policy and Its Results '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- relates the chief activities of its author , and defends the system introduced by Sir
Robert Sandemann	PERSON	, in bringing under English control some of the frontier tribes between
Northwest India	ORGANIZATION	and
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		The question at issue is as to whether it is wiser to accustom the wild Pathans of this border to submit to English intervention in their disputes , and to permit the establishment of semi-military outposts , or to leave them absolutely independent in the hope that such a policy will assure their friendship in case of a Russian advance on
India	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	is emphatically in favor of the
Forward Policy	ORGANIZATION	as opposed to the
Close Border Policy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every new government in
India	LOCATION	, he says , has entered office with the determination to check further advance toward
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, but has been forced by the necessity of the situation to alter its purpose .

		He advocates a peaceable , friendly , non - military advance , to be made on principle and not grudgingly , and cites his own and Sir
Robert Sandemann	PERSON	's labors among the
Harris	PERSON	and Bugtis in proof that such an advance is possible .

		He is not a forcible writer , and indeed makes no pretense at literary merit , but trusts to the reiteration of specific facts in Indian history to substantiate his argument .

United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The Germans in Colonial Times '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss Lucy For -
ney Bittinger	PERSON	, is the latest of these protests , a com - pact little volume of three hundred pages , into which is crowded a vast amount of interesting in - formation regarding the early German immigrants .

		The conditions in the homeland which led to the movement of population are shown , a religious condition and a social one , aud then , step by step and colony by colony , the author describes the various German bodies , many of them small relig - ious sects , Mennonites , Bunkers , Salzburgers , Mo - ravians and the like , who settled here and there from
Maine	LOCATION	to
Georgia	LOCATION	, called locally ''
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania Dutch , '' and yet having many common char - acteristics wherever found .

		The trials and tribu - lations of these immigrants are clearly shown , one interesting chapter being on the '' Redemptioners , '' in which it appears that the lot of an indented servant was often a hard one .

		A chronological table shows that the German influence was mani - fested for exactly a century before the treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	of
1783	DATE	, the first company , the one which located at
Germantown	LOCATION	, coming in
1683	DATE	.

		A quite extensive bibliography indicates wide reading .

		The writer undoubtedly performed a labor of love in the preparation of her material , and her heart was full of desire to make the best case for her friends .

		Naturally there are some faults due to over-enthu - siasm , and in some places the book lacks exact references and foot-notes , but it is none the less a welcome addition to the literature of Colonial times , and a valuable handbook regarding one important race-element in our cosmopolitan national character .

		In his preface to
Miss C. A. Button	ORGANIZATION	's interesting monograph on '' Greek Terracotta Statuettes '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
A. S. Murray	PERSON	, keeper of classical antiquities in the British Museum , states that , while anyone with the slightest artistic perception can enjoy the beauty of these dainty figurines , it is needful to share in Miss Button 's unusual erudition if one is to step beyond this , and understand how they were made , and when , and where , and why .

		To these questions A ttudy of Greek terracotta ttatutttts .

		the author returns no uncertain answer .

		Not only is the whole secret of the ancient manufacturers laid bare to the most casual reader , but such recon - dite matters as changes of coloring , and changes in dress and style , are made plain .

		To do this , it was needful to reproduce a number of typical figurines in both monotint and color , and these numerous illustrations add immensely to the value of the book .

		Many of the statuettes owe their birth to the period which gave us the immortal bits of the anthology , and the treasures of that work have been drawn upon by Miss Button for mutual comparison and elucidation , with the happiest results .

		Such a book has long been needed for general reference , and it is to be hoped that it may yet be re-issued in less expensive and more popular form .

		A wtitiionary - The sudden and vigorous growth of statesman of that young nation of the
Pacific	LOCATION	,

		One of these was the presence in that land , at critical moments , of sturdy and level-headed foreigners .

		Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	in his ''
Verbeck	PERSON	of

Revell	PERSON	-RRB- has opened our eyes to see one of those characters .

		Dr.
Guido F. Verbeck	PERSON	entered
Japan	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	and gave nearly forty years of his life to the Japanese .

		He went out as a missionary , but his success as a teacher , his wisdom as a man of affairs , and his influence as an adviser , soon secured for him unwonted power with those in authority in the dawn of
Japan	LOCATION	's modern history .

		A number of the chief authorities of state in the young gov - ernment had been his former pupils and wisely looked upon him as their best adviser ; so that when the constitution of the country was finally cast , Dr.
Verbeck	PERSON	was probably next to the dictator of its articles .

		Then , too , the educational policy of
Japan	LOCATION	, and its relation to foreign culture , to the arts and sciences , was largely shaped by the wis - dom of this same Americanized Dutchman .

		Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	has given us a noble portrait of this devoted missionary-statesman , who molded in a very definite manner the new empire of the

Anna M. Stoddard	PERSON	's life of

		Mrs.
Nichol	PERSON	was known to all anti- slavery agitators in the English-speaking world as one of that devoted few who swayed the voice and the heart of
England	LOCATION	away from mere interests of greed in the struggle between the North and the South , and turned the popular English derision of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's Emancipation Proclamation into mighty mass-meetings of praise to the
Divine Providence	ORGANIZATION	which had rid the world of its greatest curse .

		Eliza - beth
Pease	PERSON	was born in
1807	DATE	, was married to Pro- fessor
John Pringle Nichol	PERSON	in
1853	DATE	, and died soon after her ninetieth birthday , in
1897	DATE	.

		She was of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	lineage , and consecrated almost from birth THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to the cause of the hopeless and oppressed , an an - nointing which she never forgot .

		The story of her long and noble life , with its eager sympathy and deep devotion to immutable truths , is well-told in Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	's volume .

		Pleasant essays on familiar t/iemet .

		We are glad to be lectured gently on our follies and vanities and on things having to do in general with the old subject of the conduct of life , when the teaching to which we must listen is as genial and kindly , as full of a simple and wholesome wisdom , as is that of Mr.
Edward Sandford Martin	PERSON	's '' Lucid Intervals '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The chapters on '' Children , '' '' Swains and Damsels , '' '' Husbands and Wives , '' `` Education , '' `` Riches , '' and the five more that make up the book are devoted to the comfortable optimism of a man who has known how to accept things as they are and be happy .

		The subjects touched upon are old and the possibility of saying anything new upon them does not promise much , but the racy freshness of treatment , and the pleas - antly pervasive quality of the author 's personality , gives them new color and interest .

		The book has a goodly number of taking illustrations and is at - tractively bound .

		The Colonial woman , as an object of interest to her bustling and am - bitious descendants , is still having her innings , and therefore the pretty volume entitled '' Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days '' -LRB- Crow - ell -RRB- , by Miss
Geraldine Brooks	PERSON	, will doubtless find favor with readers of books of its class .

		It contains ten simply-written sketches of notable women , the list beginning with the `` first of American club women , ''
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	, and closing with
Sally Wister	PERSON	, of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, a charming Quakeress whose life , says Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, `` must have been a joy to itself and others . ''

		The characters chosen for treatment collectively represent a wide territorial range , and the flavor of the short story imparted to the sketches will commend them to readers in quest of entertainment .

		The finest craft of the bookmaker is exhibited in the latest volume by ''
E. V. B.	PERSON	, '' entitled ''
Sylvana	PERSON	's Let - ters to an Unknown Friend '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The paper is of the best , the print is large and enticing to the eye , and photographic illustrations are lavishly interspersed with the letter-press .

		The delights of gardening are the prolific theme of the writer , who has means and leisure to indulge to the utmost her taste for floriculture .

		A gentle sympathy follows her record of the flowers that pass in lovely procession through the fertile months of the year .

		A little more life and warmth in her descriptions would relieve them of a possible accusation of monotony .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	have published an '' Anthology of French Poetry , '' including examples all the way down from the tenth century to the last , trans - lated by Dean
Henry Carrington	PERSON	.

		We need not in this connection discourse upon the necessary limitations of verse translation , for they are well understood .

		What is important to say is that the present translator is thoroughly familiar with his material , and that the deft poetical touch of his versions is often remarkable .

		His range is wide , and almost every French lyrist of im - portance is represented by one or more examples .

		`` The Foundations of Botany , '' by Mr.
Joseph Y. Bergen	PERSON	, is a text-book published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is written upon the general plan of the author 's earlier `` Elements of Botany , '' but gives greatly in - creased attention to laboratory work and the study of cryptogams .

		The text proper occupies upwards of four hundred pages , and to this is appended a '' Key and Flora '' of two hundred and fifty pages more .

		In the latter section about seven hundred species , wild and cultivated , are included , which makes such an appendix really worth while .

		The directions for experimental work are abundant and explicit , and the volume has hundreds of illustrations in the text , besides a dozen or so full-page plates .

		The book is thoroughly scien - tific in method , and presents the subject in the most attractive way .

		Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	has tried an interesting experi - ment , although one not brought to a particularly happy issue , in his little book entitled '' Lucretius on Life and Death in the Metre of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	. ''

		The similarity of spirit between the Persian and the Roman poet is sufficient to justify this effort , but if there be some suggestions of the unsophisticated Omar in Mr.
Mai	PERSON	- lock 's quatrains , there is nothing of the peculiar quality that
FitzGerald	PERSON	gave to his immortal paraphrase .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has produced about a hundred quatrains , and has appended the original texts upon which they are based .

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	publishes the volume .

		Mr.
John Kenyon Kilbourn	PERSON	has compiled a volume on the `` Faiths of Famous Men in their Own Words '' -LRB-
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which shows vast industry but less judgment .

		Of its ten chapters , four are upon the Millenium , the
Intermediate State	ORGANIZATION	, the
Resurrec	PERSON	- tion , and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, although only about a third of the book itself is given to these subjects .

		The famous men who write upon such subjects are somewhat unknown .


Grover Cleveland	PERSON	, it is true , is quoted under the Mil - lenium , but his words have to do with the disarmament of nations .

		Indeed , the author has a most catholic estimate of fame and has admitted many men mostly clergymen of whom the careless world has little heard .

		Yet , the volume is full of interest , and we doubt not will serve a useful purpose in furnishing preachers with apt quotations .

		The admirable series of `` Beacon Biographies '' is being supplemented by a similar series of small volumes called the '' Westminster Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard

		The two volumes upon
John Wesley	PERSON	by Mr.
Frank Banfield	PERSON	and
Adam Duncan	PERSON	,
Lord Camperdown	PERSON	, by Mr.
H. L. Wilson	PERSON	, are good illustrations of what biographical sketches should be .

		The problems facing the two writers were precisely opposite .

		The material at hand for the biography of Wesley is voluminous , while in the case of Duncan it is strangely scauty .

		Each author , however , maintains the perspective of his subject 's life and has incidentally given us a good many side - lights upon the
England	LOCATION	of their day .

		This historical treatment is especially prominent in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's sketch of
Duncan	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 NOTES .

		Two '' Lark Classics '' are the sonnets of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and a selection from the lyrics of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		They are trim little volumes published by Mr.
Doxey	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Daily News Almanac '' for
1901	DATE	, com - piled , as for many years past , by Mr.
George E. Plumbe	PERSON	, has just been sent to us , and is a welcome addition to the reference shelf . ''

		The Rigveda , '' by Mr.
E. Vernon Arnold	PERSON	, is a new pamphlet in the series of popular studies in mythology , romance , and folklore which Mr.
David Nntt	PERSON	has been publishing from time to time .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sous publish a third edition , considerably enlarged , of '' Cabin and Plantation Songs as Sung by the Hampton Students . ''

		A few Indian songs are also comprised within the collection . ''

		The Book Hunter , '' by Mr.
John Hill Burton	PERSON	, is a bibliographical classic that needs no description at
this late day	TIME	.

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just repub - lished the work in an edition that is both neat and inex - pensive . ''

		Rouen , '' by the Rev.
Thomas Perkins	PERSON	, and '' Char - tres , '' by Mr.
H. J. L. J. Mass	PERSON	* ; , are the two most recent additions to the series of ''
Bell	PERSON	's Handbooks to
Continental Churches	ORGANIZATION	, '' issued in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A New Greek Method , '' by Mr.
William James Seelye	PERSON	, comes to us from the
Herald Printing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Wooster	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		It is a modest little book , intended to provide beginners with as short a cut as possible to their `` Anabasis . '' ''


Moore	PERSON	's Meterological Almanac and Weather Guide '' for
1901	DATE	, is published by Messrs.
Rand	PERSON	, Mc -
Nally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It bears the name of Professor
Willis L. Moore	PERSON	, but we marvel that he should have authorized so unscientific a title .

		Two volumes of biographical and critical interest , to be issued shortly by Mr.
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, are a life of
Samuel Richardson	PERSON	, by
Miss Clara L. Thomson	PERSON	, and an account of ''
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	and his Books , '' by Mr.
J. A. Hammerton	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	call our attention to the fact that their ''
Nuttall Encyclopaedia	PERSON	, '' recently mentioned in these pages as '' reissued , '' is an absolutely new work , although the title-page does not make this altogether clear .

		We cheerfully make the desired cor - rection .

		Professor
T. N. Toller	PERSON	's '' Outlines of the History of the English Language , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a serviceable text-book for students , whether in or out of school .

		It is essentially a treatise on Old English , although three chapters are devoted to the Middle and Modern periods .

		Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	's '' Elements of
Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omy , '' published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a small book but a comprehensive one .

		It is particularly well - fitted for use in such high schools and academies as are unable to devote more than a three or four months ' course to the subject of astronomy .

		The removal to
New York	LOCATION	of Professors Trent and
Wells	PERSON	has devolved the editorial conduct of `` The Sewanee Review '' upon new hands .

		The work will now be taken up by Professors
Henneman	PERSON	and
Ramage	PERSON	, of
Sewanee	LOCATION	, and we have no fear that they will do any - thing to lower the high standard already achieved by this valuable quarterly , which is just entering upon its ninth annual volume . ''

		The Stories of My Four Friends '' is a little book of nature studies for children , left in manuscript by the late
Jane Andrews	PERSON	, and now prepared for publication by her sister , Mrs.
Margaret Andrews Allen	PERSON	.

		This small volume , pleasantly written and charmingly illus - trated , is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American branch of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has arranged with the Rev.
F. N. Peloubet	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, author of '' Peloubet 's Select Notes on the International Lessons , '' to issue a Teachers ' Commentary on the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work will be complete in ten volumes , the first of which , a Commentary on
Matthew	PERSON	, will be issued at once . ''

		The Etiquette of Correspondence , '' by Miss
Helen E. Gavit	PERSON	, is a publication of the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From it one may learn how to write properly all kinds of let - ters , and obtain at the same time much useful informa - tion respecting such incidental matters as heraldry , postal regulations , the use of abbreviations , and of for - eign words and phrases . ''

		On Southern Poetry prior to 1860 , '' by Mr.
Sidney Ernest Bradshaw	PERSON	, is a doctoral dissertation presented to the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a conscientious piece of investigation , and adds one more stone to the cairn to which the twentieth century historian of our American literature will have recourse when he lays the foundations of his work . ''

		The Historical Development of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Charles M. Andrews	PERSON	, has now been before the public for three or four years , and has approved itself to judicious students of history .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons now reissue the work , two volumes in one , and call it a '' student 's edition . ''

		There are nearly a thous - and pages in the volume , and the price is moderate . ''

		A Short History of French Literature , '' by Messrs.
L. E. Kastner	PERSON	and
H. G. Atkins	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It provides a convenient manual for examination candidates , and at the same time a readable conspectus of the whole of French literature , down to the latest -LRB- or next to the latest -RRB- of the decadent writers of to-day .

		These closing chapters , indeed , while the most questionable , will probably be found the most useful in the book , for it is not always easy to obtain even such meagre information as is here offered con - cerning the French poets and novelists of the younger school .

		Following up the edition of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '' Paradise '' issued in the series of '' Temple Classics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a few months ago , we now have the `` Inferno '' in sim - ilar satisfactory form .

		The Italian text and the well - known translation of Dr.
John Aitken Carlyle	PERSON	are presented on alternate pages , with the necessary edito - rial material supplied by Mr.
H. Oelsner	PERSON	.

		Other vol - umes in the same series that have come to us during the past few weeks include Vol .

		VII .

		of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's `` Golden Legend , '' Vols .

		IV .

		and
V. of Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's Essays , Vol .

		III .

		in Mr.
F. S. Ellis	PERSON	's edition of '' The Romance of the Rose , '' and Vols .

		IV .

		to
VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		in Mr.
A. B. Hinds	PERSON	's translation of
Vasari	PERSON	's Lives , com - pleting all four of these editions .

		Last of all may be mentioned the reprints of La Motte Fouque `` s '' Sin - tram '' and '' Aslauga 's Knight , '' with illustrations by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	, and Miss Mitford 's '' Our Vil - lage . ''

FREDERIC MYERS	PERSON	.

		For some unaccountable reason , the American press has ignored the death of
Frederic Myers	PERSON	, which occurred as long ago as the seventeenth of
last month	DATE	.

		We saw no reference to it at the time , and it was not until the arrival of the English journals dated
January 26	DATE	that we were made aware of the grievous loss sus - tained by English literature in this death .

		While in no sense a popular writer , Mr.
Myers	PERSON	had a considerable following among readers of choice intelligence , and these , at least , will feel that a score of notorieties might have been better spared than this graceful poet and ac - complished essayist .

		The loss to our letters of the living personality of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	is of much the same weight as was the loss of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, and will be felt by much the same class of readers .

		He was one of the few men of our time who had mastered the literary species which we call the essay , and had vindicated its right to be considered one of the forms of creative literature .

		His ''
Virgil	PERSON	, '' his '' Greek Oracles , '' his ''
Mazzini	PERSON	, '' and his ''
Tennyson	PERSON	as Prophet , '' are hardly surpassed in all the range of our modern essay-writing ; they be - long in the same category with the best essays of
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Newman	PERSON	and Pater ; they are productions to be read and reread in the spirit with which we read the great masterpieces of verse , and they provide for us a similar quality of delight .

		A few of these essays constitute the chief claim of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	upon our affec - tions ; but it must not be forgotten that he has also given us , in his life of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, one of the best of critical biographies , and in his '' St.
Paul	PERSON	, '' one of the most spiritual of our extended poems .

		Frederic
William Henry Myers	PERSON	was born in the
Wordsworth	PERSON	country , at
Keswick	LOCATION	,
Febru	PERSON	- ary 6 ,
1843	DATE	.

		His College was
Trinity of Cam	ORGANIZATION	- bridge , where he remained for some years after taking his degree , both as fellow and as exam - iner for the
Moral Science Tripos	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like Ar - nold , he was for many years an Inspector of Schools , but
Cambridge	LOCATION	continued to be his home for the rest of his life .

		It was here that his literary work was done , and that he gath - ered about his home many of the choicest spirits of his time , attracted , in the words of the '' Athenaeum '' memorial , by '' one whose width of scientific interest and intensity of temperament were completed by a memory and a gift of exposition which was Platonic in its wealth of illustration and subtlety of humor , its magnificence and its mysticism . ''

		Leaving
England	LOCATION	, under doctor 's orders , last
December	DATE	, he went with his family to the
Riviera	LOCATION	, and then proceeded to
Rome	LOCATION	to join his friend Professor
William James	PERSON	.

		It was in
Rome	LOCATION	that he died , in the '' city of the soul '' that he had known so well in his earlier years , and 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, which had furnished inspiration for some of his finest verses .

		The books of
Frederic Myers	PERSON	are few in number ; half a dozen titles practically make out the list .

		There are the two volumes of poems , `` St.
Paul	PERSON	'' and `` The Kenewal of Youth , '' there is the study of
Wordsworth	PERSON	in the '' English Men of Letters '' series , and there are the three miscellaneous volumes called '' Essays Classical , '' '' Essays Modern , '' and '' Science and a Future Life . ''

		But these six volumes belong to English literature , for they are among the sources of spiritual refreshment that the future will not quickly neglect .

		Per - haps mention should also be made of the share taken by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	in the work called '' Phantasms of the Living '' but it is not for such work that he will be remembered , and , however imperative seemed to him the personal call to enlist in this will o ' the wisp pursuit , it must be admitted by candid observers that the psychical research activities of his later years resulted in a loss to literature with no corres - ponding gain to science .

		Few men of our time have seen with such clearness the eternal veri - ties of beauty and conduct ; few have expressed them with such eloquence or with so convincing an appeal to the highest idealism of which human nature is capable .

		That his superb powers should have been diverted into the field of un - profitable speculation , and have undertaken a task which was manifestly unworthy of them , is a circumstance that must always be regrettable .

		The best of the essays of this writer are almost matchless in their effectiveness of con - struction and their beauty of expression .

		When in full sympathy with his theme , he has the power to impart both his thought and his emotion to the reader so fully that they become a permanent possession .

		The elements of this power almost elude analysis , yet we may easily distinguish such features as the charm of the writer 's cadence , his felicitous use of quotation , and the cumulative effect produced by his skilful marshalling of illustrative material .

		An extract from the `` Virgil '' will help to make clear our meaning .

		After making a series of references to parti cularVirgilian verses preg - nant with emotional associations , he goes on : '' But there is not at any rate need to prove the es - timation in which
Virgil	PERSON	has been held in the past .

		The force of that tradition would only be weakened by specification .

		The chastest poet , ' in
Bacon	LOCATION	's words , and royalest ,
Virgilius Maro	PERSON	, that to the memory of man is known , ' has lacked in no age until our own the concordant testimony of the civilized world .

		No poet has lain so close to so many hearts ; no words so often as his have sprung to men 's lips in moments of excite - ment and self - revelation , from the one fierce line re - tained and chanted by the untameable boy who was to be Emperor of
Rome	LOCATION	, to the impassioned prophecy of the great English statesman as he pleaded till morning 's light for the freedom of a continent of slaves .

		And those who have followed by more secret ways the in - fluence which these utterances have exercised on man - kind know well , perhaps themselves have shared , the mass of emotion which has slowly gathered round certain lines of
Virgil	PERSON	's as it has round certain texts of the
Bible	LOCATION	, till they come to us charged with more than an individual passion and with a meaning wider than their own with the cry of the despair of all generations , with the yearning of all loves uuappeased , with the anguish of all partings , ' beneath the pressure of separate eternities . ' ''

		Such prose as this is an achievement no less remarkable than is poetry of a very high order , and patches of this royal purple are not infre - quent in the text of the three volumes of essays .

		The wanderings of Mr.
Myers	PERSON	in the morass of psychical research resulted from a passionate desire to secure to other men rational grounds for the resting of their fundamental religious beliefs .

		His own faith , of the transcendental sort that feels no need of corroborative evidence , was voiced in these stanzas from ''
St. Paul	LOCATION	'' : ''
Whoso	PERSON	has felt the Spirit of the Highest Can not confound nor doubt Him nor deny ; Yea , with one voice , world , though thou denieat , Stand thou on that side , for on this am I. `` Rather the earth shall doubt when her retrieving Pours in the rain and rushes from the sod , Rather than he for whom the great conceiving Stirs in his soul to quicken into God . ''

		But this inward illumination does not come to the many , who stand sadly in need of a more material justification for their faith .

		This was the thought that impelled Mr.
Myers	PERSON	to sift the accumulations of popular superstition , thinking perchance to find therein the grain of truth so deeply longed for by mankind .

		This it was that made him find , as in the Messianic Eclogue of
Virgil	LOCATION	, a truly prophetic utterance in these Tennysonian lines : '' And we , the poor earth 's dying race , and yet No phantoms , watching from a phantom shore Await the last and largest sense to make The phantom walls of this illusion fade And show us that the world is wholly fair . ''

		This it was that made him end his essay on ''
Tennyson	PERSON	as Prophet '' in the following un - forgettable strain : '' If indeed the Cosmos make for good , and evolution be a moral as well as a material law , will men in time avail to prove it ?

		For then they will look back on Tennyson as no belated dreamer , but as a leader who in the darkest hour of the world 's thought would not despair of the destiny of man .

		They will look back on him as Romans looked back on that unshakable Roman who purchased at its full price the field of Cannae , on which at that hour victorious Hannibal lay encamped with his Carthaginian host . ''

		THE DIAL 97 MESSAGES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY POETS .

		Perspective is a prime essential of true vision .

		One merely conjures with the future when , at the completion of the nineteenth century , he essays definite prediction regarding the ultimate place of its authors , either in specific rank or in comparative services to the world 's literature .

		Moreover , such valuations often change with the needs and moods of successive generations .

		One age gives exclusive laurels to
Socrates	LOCATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and Addi - son .

		The next , with equal fervor , urges the rival claims of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	, and
Samuel John	PERSON	- son .

		Poetry , no less than other forms of literature during the last hundred years , has had an unpre - cedented list of aspirants for the
Hall of Fame	ORGANIZATION	.

		Possibly a later generation of readers , in the reac - tion from the hurtling haste of present life , may find some true '' life of the spirit '' among the submerged , as well as the popular , poets of the past cycle .

		In every century and nation , there have been poets of evanescent charm versus poets with per - manent message .

		The former may excel in beauties of form , but they fail to win that lasting , reverential memory which signalizes the '' vates , '' or prophet - poet .

		Dante ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, each had a mission and a message not alone to the ear but also to the soul of his century .

		Elimi - nating all question of rank , we recognize certain prophecies , fulfilled or potential , spoken by the rep - resentative poets in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	during the last century .

		Critics have noted that the period at the meeting of centuries , arbitrary rather than logical in divi - sion of time , is often marked by unrest , contradic - tion , and transition .

		Whether such symptoms are psychologic or pathologic , it is not our part to dis - cuss .

		The Revolutionary movement , the last in the great triad of progressive world-forces , germinated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and cul - minated in the eighteenth .

		Its frenzied aftermath in
France	LOCATION	, seeming to presage the overthrow of all new-established ideals of liberty and faith , produced the gloom and vacillation which ushered in the nineteenth century .

		Senancour ,
Lamartine	PERSON	, and Chateaubriand in
France	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, mirrored the hope , quenched by despair , on this final battle-ground of the old and new political principles .

		The constitutional reforms in
England	LOCATION	, which for more than a century had doomed absolutism , had found recognition and prophecy of yet greater advance in the earlier prophet-poets ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	, and
Burns	PERSON	, who was emboldened to proclaim , '' But while we sing ' God save the
King	LOCATION	, ' We '11 ne'er forget the People . ''

		As the decades passed , with the surety that , despite the transitory horrors of its progress , political lib - erty had become a fixed world-principle , the English poets uttered their triumphant message of democ - racy .

		The earlier group found it almost impossible to reconcile the lofty concepts of freedom and pro- gress with the social and religious anarchism rife during the final contention , yet they never relin - quished their ideals .

		Amid the desperate scepticism of '' Childe Harold '' and '' Giaour , '' one clear note sounded : ' * Freedom 's battle , once began , Beqaeath 'd by bleeding sire to son , Though battled oft , is ever won . ''

		The boyish unrestraint of Shelley 's '' Ode to Lib - erty '' became softened into the calmer though vague hope of '' Prometheus Unbound '' and ' The Cenci . ''

		Readers are familiar with the successive stages of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetic self-revelations , from the early hey-day of enthusiasm , followed by havoc of hopes and beliefs , to the gradual attainment of a sane , steadfast faith in ultimate freedom from all material and spiritual shackles .

		The life-story repeats itself from '' The Prelude '' and early sonnets to '' Tintern Abbey '' and '' The Excursion . ''

		Democracy has not been a stable institution bat a progressive movement .

		Overthrow of political despotism was only an advance stage in its incep - tion .

		Tennyson , the true exponent of the pulse of the
last half-century	DATE	, embodied this thought in the dedicatory stanzas ' '' To the Queen '' : '' And statesmen at her councils met Who knew the seasons when to take Occasion by the hand and make The bounds of freedom wider yet '' By shaping some
august	DATE	decree Which kept her throne unshaken still , Broad-based upon her people 's will , And compassed by the inviolate sea . ''

		The democracy of these later decades , ever tending toward socialism and suggesting the abolition of constitutional monarchy and republic alike , is re - flected in the songs and visions by
Swinburne	PERSON	,
William Morris	PERSON	, and their disciples , but their true services to the poetry of the age will be noted later in a different message .

		Democracy was the fontal principle of the life of
America	LOCATION	, and her poetry could not fail to portray its emanation .

		The noble hymns of
Emerson	LOCATION	, the virile war-songs of
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	PERSON	's famous satire and his later Commemoration odes , can never be overlooked in a review of the poetry which inter - prets the vital issues of the century .

		The term , '' Poet of Democracy , '' has been accepted as the especial cognomen of that American author whose poetry is open to constant challenge , but his democ - racy , never .

		Whitman 's message is bold , some - times blatant , yet vibrant with courage and elemental worship .

		Delighting in the repetitive utterance of `` the word , Democratic , the word , En-Masse , '' he was also a loud herald of the second great principle of the century , closely linked with democracy , fraternity : '' I will make the most splendid race the snn ever shone upon , I will make divine , magnetic lands , With the love of comrades .

		With the life-long love of comrades . ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, In spite of the later revolutions on the Continent , when human life seemed of less value than chaff , the germinal movement toward democracy ever commingled brotherhood with political rights for the individual and the nation .

		This altruistic ideal has expanded as the political principle has pro- gressed , until it has permeated the spirit of nearly all great poetry of the age .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Coppe	PERSON	`` e ,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, have joined with English and American authors in iteration of the gospel of mutual , uplifting service .

		In his briefer lyrics , and in the tender narratives of '' Margaret '' and u
Michael	PERSON	, ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	testified to his close sym - pathy with the heart of the common people , to his advocacy of social as well as political unity . ''

		The Bridge of Sighs , '' '' Apparent Failure , '' '' The Cry of the Human , '' '' The Vision of Sir Launf al , '' such poems bear stamp of a century awakened , as never before , to fraternal and social service .

		Lanier , in '' The Symphony , '' and Kipling , in his staccato pleas for oppressed and submerged humanity , have given timely rebuke to that commercialism and competition which threaten death to the spirit of brotherhood .

		One of the anterior influences which gave impetus to democracy was the increase , during the eighteenth century , of scientific knowledge among all classes .

		This propagation , through English and French en - cyclopaedic and philosophic channels , reached its natural culmination in the famous expositions dur - ing the middle decades of the century .

		Dangers of materialism and spiritual chaos lurked about the tenets of
Darwin	PERSON	and
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Spencer	PERSON	and Mill , until the years could fuse and interpret , could re - place the shattered illusions with new joy and sat - isfaction in fixed laws controlling Nature and life .

		To wisely apply such scientific knowledge and method to all phases of the century 's life , poli - tics , economics , religion , became the mission of the poets no less than the philosophers and reform - ers .

		In place of the social anarchism of
Godwin	PERSON	, the political and religious despair of
Byron	PERSON	, and the embryonic yet unfulfilled philosophy of
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , came into life and poetry the surety of a scientific law which could satisfy both the reason and soul .

		With a mind plastic to the premonitions of the future as well as the influences of the past ,
Shelley	PERSON	had yearned to the last for that '' Spirit of the Universe , '' that vast '' Force-Idea , '' so soon to be vested with new scientific insight and reverence .

		A sincere , persistent zeal for the deep facts and laws pervaded poetry and produced the so-called realism of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Clough	PERSON	, and their followers .

		A new poetic imagination , combining the real and the ideal , was symbolized in Words - worth 's '' Skylark , '' '' Type of the wise who soar but never roam , True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home . ''

		In '' The Spanish Gypsy , '' as in her later novels ,
George Eliot	PERSON	applied this spirit of science in the analysis of character and in ethical teaching .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	proclaimed the ultimate blending of science and poetry , of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's law and man 's work .

		Emerson and Whitman , in most distinctive forms , announced the poetic harmony of all physical and psychic forces , '' For Nature beats in perfect tune , And rounds with rhyme her every rune . ''

		The two great English poets of the latter half of the century were marked adherents of evolutionary method .


Browning	PERSON	turned the lens of a scientist , with the intense sympathy of a poet , upon the hidden motor struggles of passion and soul .


Tenny	PERSON	- son studied the scientific laws no less than the pic - torial beauties of the '' Flower in the Crannied Wall , '' while he also explored the manifestations of mind and heart . ''

		Sordello '' and ''
Rabbi Ben Ezra	PERSON	, '' '' In Memoriam , '' and '' The Higher Pan - theism , '' all witness '' One God , one Law , one Element . ''

		Coexistent with the political and scientific ad - vance which had awakenfd the world from the atrophy of the previous century , had come religious revolutions , extending with diverse radiations through the entire nineteenth century .

		In the main , the progress of theological thought has been in accord with the affiliated principles of freedom and scientific law .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's story in poetic prose is a fitting climatic expression of the evolu - tionary , religious leaven of the century .

		There have been , however , occasional reactionary symptoms , like the Tractarian and other ecclesiastic move - ments , which have caused doubts and recessions , often reflected in the poetry of the last half-century .

		Perhaps no poet sought more earnestly than
Clough	PERSON	to find and transmit a religious message to his age .

		Lacking the emotional equipoise of
Arnold	LOCATION	, with whom he shared the disturbing influences of Ox - ford , he made a valiant fight against the refuge of agnosticism , and spent himself in a struggle to rec - oncile religious uncertainties with spiritual vision and aspiring life .

		Over the doubt shines a rare spiritual fervor , rapturous in '' Easter .

		Day '' and ` Through a Glass Darkly . ''

		Clough found the panacea for religious gropings in the message of ''
Qui Laborat	PERSON	, Orat , '' a strong poetic rendering of
Carlyle 's Gospel of Work	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tennyson , prone by nature to speculation , influ - enced yet more by the religious atmosphere of unrest and by personal grief , traversed successive mental stages , from the vacillation of '' The Two O Voices '' to the acceptance with '' Faith that comes of self-control The truths that never can be proved , '' which forms the message of '' In Memoriam '' and of his later poems .

		With
Clougb	PERSON	, Tennyson em - phasized the religion of effort , first , to surpass our '' dead selves , '' second , to perform some service for the world .

		The pivotal note in his great elegy rests upon this gospel ; then bursts forth the New Year 's carol , merging individual loss and doubt beneath hopes for a nobler world-religion .


Browning	PERSON	, with a child-like , unquestioning trust ,
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 99 akin to that of
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		expends none of his matchless analysis upon religions dogmas , but pro- claims , as basis of his creed , a militant knowledge born of dauntless faith .

		In
Tennyson	PERSON	's strongest assurances , his chosen words are '' hope '' or '' be - lieve '' ;
Browning	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	fearlessly exclaim , '' I know . ''

		It were difficult to long cherish doubt when under the spell of '' Abt Vogler '' or `` Para - celsus '' : '' I know , I felt , -LRB- perception unexpressed , Uncomprehended by our narrow thought , But somehow felt and known in every shift And change in the spirit , nay , in every pore Of the body , even , -RRB- what God is , what we are , What life is how God tastes an infinite joy In infinite ways one everlasting bliss From whom all being emanates , all power Proceeds ; in whom is life forevermore , Yet whom existence in its lowest form Includes ; where dwells enjoyment there is he . ''


Browning	PERSON	's religion , however , is not confined to faith ; it has a major passionate strain .

		All life is a conflict , a battle between '' the spirit 's true en - dowments '' and the forces of evil within and about man .

		It is this quality of unceasing , strenuous struggle , always with a guarantee of victory for the good soldier , that gives to his poems a dramatic energy capable of triumph over obscurities and wilful laxities which would be unpardonable in any lesser poet .

		The same '' drum-taps '' of robust , zealous life , immense in passion , pulse , and power , '' give vitality and far-reaching force to the stanzaic messages of Whitman and Kipling .

		While modern life , with its strenuonsness .

		its zeal for newness and thrill in thought and emotions , its pride in political , scientific , and religious advance unequalled in any previous century , has had full reflection in the poetry of the age , there has been a revival , no less unprecedented , of the ideals and forms of earlier art and thought .

		The universal message of poetry as an art has been as distinctly uttered as the problems and aspirations of present - day activity .


Browning	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Morris	PERSON	have chosen the symbolism and atmosphere of medisevalism , the ideals and traditions of chivalry and the Renaissance , as media for strong social warnings and prophecies .

		To re-study and re-picture the beauties of fancy and noble life among the Greeks , the Norsemen , and the disciples of chivalry and monasticism , with the masterly skill of
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	, is to perform no small service for the literature of an age too prone to forget the past in pressure of current interests .

		Prince of the poets who sought relief from the confusions of his own age in the reposeful glories of past art , is
Keats	PERSON	.

		Amid the social and religious ferment about him he spoke the reactionary mes - sage of art as the true guide toward a life where truth and beauty could be identical .

		His place and mission in the century 's literature closely re - sembles
Ruskin	PERSON	's .

		The new century may well heed their warnings against such absorption in commer - cialism and science as will shrivel the artistic faculty and dwarf the soul .

		In workmanship , whether as rejuvenators of some forgotten fancy and metre , or as creators of some new beauty under familiar form , the century 's poets of pure art have merited high praise .

		A generation which could produce '' The Blessed Damozel , '' '' The Earthly Paradise , '' and ''
Atlanta	LOCATION	in Calydon , '' to mention no further , has already attained rank among the great master - artists in verse .

		One could easily enumerate a long list of themes , touching the minds , morals , emotions , and tastes of this age , upon which the poets of the century have spoken with oracular force .

		There remains , however , one characteristic , perchance the most comprehensive and important , surely the most uni - versal , trait of the poets .

		A keen observation , mingled with an intimate sympathy for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, is noted alike among realists and romanticists , among the earlier and later poets with cumulative fervor .

		The eighteenth century initiated this relationship between humanity and the sanative lessons of wave and wind , bird and flower .

		The spread of science merely gave new and definite impetus to the ideals already bespoken by
Rousseau	PERSON	and the
Sentimen	PERSON	- talists , by
Cowper	PERSON	and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, by
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	and
Young	PERSON	.

		Logical observation and health-inspiring comradeship , with ever increasing unity , have per - meated the poetry of the century from
Wordsworth	LOCATION	to
Watson	PERSON	.

		American poets must rest their claim to recognition largely upon their intuitive , delicate Nature-lyrics .

		The poet has served a special mission in an age of science .

		He has combined the quali - ties of analyst and artist ; he has urged communion as well as study .

		Viewed thus , not alone as an element but also as a presence .

		Nature offers , through the poets , the only possible expansion of life in its entirety , the only unassailable fount of religious teaching .

		``
Saul	PERSON	, '' one of the master - poems of the century , is a noble embodiment of this truth .

		Through the sensuous , life-bestowing media of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's images , the king 's shattered mind re - gained its poise and God-recognizing power .

		Glancing over the poetry of the cycle , we recog - nize that much has been crude and ephemeral , much has been potent and energizing .

		There have been produced no great dramas , no great epics , but the record contains a few noble elegies , some matchless sonnets , character-portrayals unsurpassed in real vitality , and a vast number of lyrics whose fancy and melody admit of no competition in previous centuries .

		Five great names , at least , deserve rank beside the prophet-poets of the past , Words - worth ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		There have been poems of doubt and despair , mes - sages of agnosticism and futility of effort , but the passing decades have proclaimed less unrest , more faith , less heart-eating apathy , more soul-stimulating conflict for the individual and the race , `` By the pain-throb , triumphantly winning intensified bliss , And the next world 's reward and repose , by the struggles in this .

		SOME QUESTIONS SUGGESTED BY PROFESSOR WENDELL 'S `` LITERARY HISTORY OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAI , . -RRB-

		On the strength of the editorial in THE DIAL of
Dec. 16	DATE	, I have beten reading Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's '' Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' and I quite agree with you that Professor
Wendell	PERSON	in this book '' has produced incomparably the best history of American Literature thus far written by anybody . ''

		It is , in many respects , a profound book .

		It is at all times a readable book .

		Its characterization of movements and authors is well - nigh absolute with the exception perhaps of its treat - ment of
Poe	PERSON	and Whitman , the two doubtful members of the American school , who ought to be given at this time , one would think , the benefit of the doubt .

		But with all its merits it is still a debatable book , and I have set down , without elaboration , some of the points about which there might be dispute .

		In the first place the series of literary histories , of which this volume is one , was conceived by a European from a European point of view .

		In the foreword of the series one reads of '' the conflict of dynasties , '' '' the popular panorama of kings and queens , '' '' the quarrels of rival parliaments , '' which , it is said , have hitherto engrossed the attention of historians .

		On this ground there is surely no reason for a literary history of
America	LOCATION	.

		Not having been dazzled by kings and queens , our historians notably
Parkman	PERSON	,
Eggleston	LOCATION	,
Roose	PERSON	- velt , and
Fiske	PERSON	have done full justice to every phase of our national development , including the intellectual and artistic .

		In the same preface it is written that '' in spite of history , the poets are the true masters of the earth , '' and that '' if all record of a nation 's progress were blotted out , and its literature were yet left us , might we not recover the outlines of its lost history ? ''

		In view of the fact that no American poet , with possibly one or two exceptions , has ever mastered any portion of this earth our expansion being frankly materialistic , even imperialistic , '' if you please , and not transcen - dental the first claim seems preposterous , and the other suggestion is denied by the very evidence of this present literary history .

		Two centuries of American history , a period big with events , are almost without literary record , and of the 518 pages of this volume , 479 deal with
Boston	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	and what is called here the `` Middle States '' -LRB- with the western boundary at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	! -RRB-

		.

		A poor hurried section of thirty - nine pages is devoted to the South and the rest of the
United States !	LOCATION

		This denotes either that Professor
Wendell	PERSON	happens to know more about
Boston	LOCATION	than about the rest of the Republic , or that the propo - sition that our literature is equivalent to our history is false .

		The fact is that the intellectual life of Ameri - cans is not confined by the walls of colleges or by the pages of books .

		The Men who Do are with us far more intellectual , energetic , and creative , than the Men who Write .

		Boston Unitarianism and Transcendental - ism are not of much moment compared with the Win - ning of the
West	LOCATION	.

		There are other points of Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's own statement that are also debatable .

		I have jotted down a few to present to a class which has the volume under review .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- Is it true that the ideals of a nation are shaped by the language it adopts for a common medium ?

		Trace the influence of '' the tongue that Shakespeare spake and the faith and morals which
Milton	PERSON	held '' upon the German settlers in
Chicago	LOCATION	or upon the Ne - groes of the South .

		How much do race and environ - ment modify the primary effects of language ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Do you accept the substitution of the phrase , '' English Literature in
America	LOCATION	, '' for the common des - ignation , '' American Literature '' ?

		Would you speak likewise of French Art in
America	LOCATION	or German Music in
America	LOCATION	?

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Is it more profitable as more rational to study American Literature as an independent develop - ment , correlating our own literature and history , or as a dependent literature , with emphasis upon the tradi - tional and imitative features and its correspondence to English literature ?

		-LRB- I shall here point to the ease of making comparison by the use of
Ryland	ORGANIZATION	's and Whit - comb 's '' Outlines , '' and also to Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's satirical remark concerning Prince 's History of
New England	LOCATION	, which began its account with '' an epitome of the most remarkable transactions and events abroad , from the creation . '' -RRB-

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Do you prefer to say the
United States	LOCATION	are or the
United States	LOCATION	isf Is this merely a question of grammar ?

		Would the study of English Literature in
America	LOCATION	affect the idealism of one who persists in speaking of the
United States	LOCATION	as plural ?

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- In discussing the literary history of
America	LOCATION	is it sufficient to consider only what is written in the English language ?

		Is it fair to ignore the French literature of
Louisiana	LOCATION	?

		Would
Rosenfeld	PERSON	's sweat-shop poems , writ - ten in Yiddish , have any bearing upon American history ?

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- Does the actual history of
America	LOCATION	, as recorded by
John Fiske	PERSON	, betoken '' national inexperience '' ?

		Does England exhibit any less '' inexperience '' than
America	LOCATION	in respect to those forces which are shaping the modern world in both hemispheres ?

		How much of
England	LOCATION	's substantial experience is due to the survival of the feudal traditions down to and including
Tennyson	PERSON	?

		Was not the revolutionary literature of
England	LOCATION	due to
England	LOCATION	's inability to have a genuine revolutionary ex - perience ?

		Would the meagre revolutionary literature of
France	LOCATION	indicate '' national inexperience '' also ?

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- In a literary history of
America	LOCATION	how much atten - tion should be given to local phases of thought , such as
Boston Unitarianism	LOCATION	and Transcendentalism ?

		-LRB- 8 -RRB- Do you agree with Professor
Wendell	PERSON	in his ex - planation of the growth of '' imperialism '' in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	?

		I consider it the function of a pedagogue to put questions as it is perhaps the function of a historian of literature to arouse them .

		THE NINE GREAT AUTHORS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Jackson Boyd	PERSON	's communication in the
Jan. 16	DATE	number of THE DIAL on '' Ten Great Authors of the Century '' might perhaps better have been deferred to a later issue , so that he could have had time and opportunity to profit by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's statement in the same number : '' The most aggravating of all critics is the critic who asserts .

		... '' Positivism would seem , from his article , to be Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's philos - ophy of literature , if not of life .

		Certainly his state -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 101 ments have the merit of certitude and conviction , in spite of their very evident defects from the standpoint of `` things as they are . ''

		Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's article calls
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Comte	LOCATION	, Dar - win ,
Spencer	PERSON	,
Marx	PERSON	,
Ward	PERSON	,
Eliot	LOCATION	, de Maupassant , Tol - stoi , and
Bentham	PERSON	'' the preeminent authors of the nineteenth century . ''

		Thus he does not give a list of '' the greatest influences of the century , '' or '' the greatest men of the century , '' but of '' the greatest authors of the century , '' in short , the greatest writers of literature .

		Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	goes somewhat beyond necessity when he says : ``
Schopenhauer	PERSON	is the greatest metaphysician that ever lived . ''

		He had need only to prove that he was the greatest metaphysician of the nineteenth cen - tury , to prove his greatness as a nineteenth century metaphysician .

		But
Schopenhauer	PERSON	might be '' the greatest metaphysician that ever lived , '' or ever will live , and still fail to be one of '' the preeminent authors of the nineteenth century '' one of the makers of lit - erature .

		Literature has no final -LRB- only an accidental -RRB- relation with metaphysics .

		He says , of science , ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	was the most argumentative mind of the century . ''

		What of it ? ''

		Literature is the presentation of life in an artistic form .

		No man of science has ever been an artist , al - though some , as , for example ,
Darwin	PERSON	and Huxley , have been believed by their friends to have been such . ''

		Thus Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	, and '' the consensus of critical opinion '' upholds his position . ''


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	is the greatest Individualist of the race . ''

		Perhaps he is the greatest '' individual '' of the race .

		He is certainly great in his sphere ; but as a writer of literature he has surprisingly little to offer .


Karl Marx	PERSON	is one of the '' master-minds of man . ''

		But he is not one of the master-minds of literature .

		His claims to literary greatness may be dismissed with the statement that he was '' a famous German socialist . ''

		What has that to do with literature ? ''


Lester F. Ward	PERSON	is the most practical philosopher the century has produced . ''

		As '' practical philosophy 's '' connection with literature is of the remotest , we need , perhaps , say no more about Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's literary claims to `` real greatness . ''

		11
George Eliot	PERSON	is the only writer of light literature who has any claim to real greatness . '' ''

		It is indeed a discovery , '' writes
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in '' Aspects of Fiction , '' '' to find that any man able to read and write is capable of classifying as ' light literature ' the acute and subtle study of the process of
Tito	ORGANIZATION	's steady moral disintegration under recurring temptation . ''

		The ref - erence , of course , is to
George Eliot	PERSON	's '' Romola . ''

		The same statement applies with about equal force to
George Eliot	PERSON	's other work .

		It is also , indeed , a discovery to learn that '' light literature '' gives anyone a claim to '' real greatness . ''

		But granting that
George Eliot	PERSON	has other claims to '' real greatness '' than '' light literature , '' surely the nineteenth century has produced novelists greater than she ,
Balzac	LOCATION	and Hugo in
France	LOCATION	;
Thack	PERSON	- eray ,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
George Meredith	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Guy de Maupassant is the most artistic story-teller the world has ever produced . ''

		This is the only one of Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's formulas to which we can give even partial acceptance .

		The art of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, which produced such achievements of story-telling as '' The Piece of String , '' `` The Necklace , '' `` Coward , '' and '' Little Soldier , '' is certainly an art which , in mere artfulness -LRB- I do not use the term slightingly -RRB- , has sel - dom been equalled .

		He has a few disputants to the title of '' the greatest short-story teller of the century , '' however , as , for example ,
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, who , though inferior to the Frenchman in form and structure , surpasses him in the richness and charm of his style , and is ethically stronger at all points .

		And
Poe	PERSON	and Hawthorne !

		The author of '' The Cask of Amontillado , '' and the man who wrote '' Wakefield '' and ''
David Swan	PERSON	, '' have produced almost if not quite as great short stories as have ever been written in French .

		`` Count
Leo Tolstoi	PERSON	-LSB- is -RSB- the most artistic novelist -LSB- the world has ever produced -RSB- . ''

		I am as much sur - prised at this statement as the author of ''
Anna Kare	PERSON	- nina '' himself would be , if he heard of it .

		`` God 's moral '' is what he is after , and he often shows it , seldom artistically , more often with evident effort .

		As far as form goes , he is huge and structureless . ''

		One of the greatest authors of all time is
Jeremy Bentham	PERSON	. ''

		The writings of
Jeremy Bentbam	PERSON	have no literary merit whatever .

		His style is turgid , involved , and obscure .

		Even as knowledge they have been largely superseded .

		And now , having tried to set aside Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's list of `` the preeminent authors of the nineteenth century , '' what have I to offer in its place ?

		Who will dispute that
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	are the greatest poets of the nineteenth century , and two of the greatest poets of all time ?

		No historian , essayist , or other writer in prose other than fiction , except
John Ruskin	PERSON	, has attained to the first rank in literature in the nineteenth century .

		But his , at its best , magnificent style , like the peals of some '' grand organ harmony '' swelling , helps lift his work away from the mere writing of knowledge , '' discussion and conflict , '' up to the '' eternal peaks of pure litera - ture . ''


John Ruskin	PERSON	ranks among '' the nine great authors of the nineteenth century , '' in spite of the fact that his work is , mostly , not included in any of the three great forms of literary art .

		In fiction ,
Balzac	LOCATION	and
George Meredith	PERSON	are the great - est novelists , while the short story has four equalities ,
Poe	PERSON	, de Maupassant ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		In
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	we have both a writer of short stories of the very first rank -LRB- `` Will o ' the Mill , '' '' Markheim , '' '' Thrawn Janet '' -RRB- , and also a novelist who , in at least one of his tales , '' The Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, '' gives us a story worthy to be ranked with the greatest fiction of the century of all time .

		Balzac is probably the greatest novelist of the world , and immeasurably his superior in all the '' amenities of style '' is Meredith .

		In technique , if in technique only ,
Meredith	PERSON	is without a peer , while '' the body of his work '' is also most satisfactory .

		Professor
Saintsbury	PERSON	says : `` When these two things coincide in literature , or elsewhere , then that in which they coincide may be called , and must be called , Great , without hesi - tation , and without reserve . ''

		Meredith 's extreme jus - tification is in the future , while
Balzac	LOCATION	has already - come into his own .

		The art of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- except , perhaps , in their masterpieces , ''
David Cop	PERSON	- perfield '' and '' Vanity Fair , '' certainly less in these than in the rest of their work -RRB- is , as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has recently shown , largely '' the art of a by-gone age . ''


Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	,
Robert Browning	PERSON	,
Honore	PERSON	' de
Balzac	LOCATION	,
George Meredith	PERSON	,
Edgar Allen Poe	PERSON	,
Robert Louis Stev	PERSON	- enson , Guy de Maupassant ,
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	,
John Ruskin	PERSON	, these seem to me '' the preeminent authors of the nineteenth century . ''

		OXFORD MEMORIES .

		* Someone ,
Carlyle	PERSON	we dare say , speaks of
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	's books as `` printed talk . ''

		The de - scription , which is a handy one and nowadays widely applicable , nicely fits the Rev.
W. Tuckwell	PERSON	's book of Oxford recollections , and very good talk it is , though younger noses may detect in its earlier and even its later chapters a somewhat '' ancient and fishlike smell . ''

		For Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	seems the Nestor of Oxonians , his memories going back largely to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in the Thirties the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	to which you were driven in a coach -LRB- the '' Tantivy , '' the ''
Reg	PERSON	- ulator , '' the ''
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	, '' the '' Rival , '' and so forth -RRB- , by a Jehu of the tribe of
Weller	PERSON	; the Oxford of Gibbonian '' port and prejudice '' ; the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	to which Museums , Art Galleries , Local Examinations , Science Degrees ,
Exten	ORGANIZATION	- sion Lectures , Women 's Colleges , and the like commonplaces of to-day were as yet innovations , germinant or threatened , at which dondom gravely shook its head , scenting heresy and schism , and the intrusion of ideas subversive of scholastic standards , learned reputations , the reign of the Humanities , and fat livings .

		Science especially , with its bold pretensions , was , as
Gambetta	PERSON	said of clericalism , felt to be '' the enemy . ''

		Conservatism hated it because it was new ; orthodoxy because , like the inven - tor in
Dickens	LOCATION	, it persisted in '' wanting to know . ''

		Even men like
Jowett	PERSON	, says our author , '' Proclaimed war on it on behalf of the ' ancient studies / as encroaching on and menacing the ' higher conception of knowledge and of the mind , ' as antago - nistic to ' morals and religion ' curiously unaware that their own avowed ignorance of its nature , subjects , tendencies , precluded them from forming , much more from expressing , an opinion . ''

		Science , however , persisted in its efforts to break into the sanctuary with -LRB- as its enemies might have said -RRB- '' a jemmy '' ; and in the end succeeded .

		Molested was the ancient , solitary reign of Theology ; broken the monopoly of the Humanities .

		The first representative of note of the new learning was
Daubeny Doctor Daubeny	ORGANIZATION	, professor of chemistry , bot - any , rural economy , who wrote on Roman husbandry , experimented much in horticulture , planting his famous '' Physic Garden , '' and building houses wherein flourished the Victoria * REMINISCENCES OF OXFORD .

		The Doctor was something of an oddity , out - wardly a droll , fantastically clad figure , but genial and chatty in society .

		For zoological purposes he kept , in a great cage let into the
Danby	PERSON	gateway , a collection of monkeys , which a mischievous undergraduate liberated one night , to the general joy of his appreciative fellows next day .

		The wanderers were re - captured , after an exciting chase and some perilous climbing ; but the Doctor was pained by what he considered an affront to himself , and his menagerie was eventually dispersed .


Buckland	PERSON	was the next savant of note at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		His lecture-room filled at once , not so much with students as with dons -LRB- attracted no less by the vivacity of his talk than the novelty of his theme -RRB- , among them Shuttle - worth , father of the couplet `` Some doubts were expressed about the Flood ,
Buckland	PERSON	arose , and all was clear as mud . ''

		Buckland at first posed as regular and rec - oncilist , his earlier writings containing little to provoke the heresy-hunters .

		Then , in
1836	DATE	, appeared his
Bridgewater Treatise	ORGANIZATION	, and stones from orthodox slings at once flew about his offending -LRB- and disregarding -RRB- head .

		Dean
Gaisford	PERSON	of
Christchurch	LOCATION	thanked God on the fossil-hunting professor 's departure for
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		We shall , '' he comfortably thought , '' hear no more of his geology . ''

		Pusey , blinking anxiously at the new light , bustled about warn - ing men to avert their eyes from it , and or - ganizing a protest against the proposed degree for Professor Owen ; the saintly Keble clenched a bitter plea against the new science with the powerful argument worthy of patristic days that '' when God made the stones he made the fossils in them . ''

		Buckland had a most efficient and zealous helper in his wife .

		From her , says Mr.
Tuck	PERSON	- well , came the first suggestion as to the true character of the lias coprolites . ''

		When , at two o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, the idea flashed upon him that the Cheirotherium footsteps were testudinal , he woke his wife from sleep ; she hastened down to make paste upon the kitchen table , while he fetched in the tortoise from the garden ; and the pair soon saw with joint delight that its impressions on the paste were almost identical with those upon the slabs . ''

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, as Dean
Gaisford	PERSON	could not have been surprised to hear ,
Buckland	PERSON	went on pursuing the iconoclastic tenor of his way .

		At Palermo he visited
Saint Rosalia	ORGANIZATION	's shrine .

		The receptacle was opened by the attendant priest , and the relics were reverently disclosed .

		THE DIAL 103 Thousands of believing pilgrims -LRB- such is the efficacy of faith -RRB- had knelt before them and had their souls eased thereby and their bodies healed , and had gratefully bestowed their obolus on departing .

		But to the hard eye of the man of science and little faith the bones were not sacred , were not even Rosalia 's . ''

		They are , '' said he , '' the bones of a goat , not of a woman '' and the sanctuary doors were abruptly shut in his face , as
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	doors would have been before had
Gaisford	PERSON	and the rest had their way about it .

		Before taking leave of
Buckland	PERSON	let us quote his Johnsonian retort to a North Briton who `` heckled '' him during a lecture : '' ' It would seem , ' queried a sceptical Caledonian during a lecture in
North Britain	LOCATION	, ' that your animals alwavs walked in one direction ? '

		` Yes , ' was the re - ply , '
Cheirotherium	PERSON	was a Scotchman , and be always travelled south . ' ''

		What the initiative and persistence of Dr.
Acland	PERSON	did for the establishment of Science and Art at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is , or ought to be , well known .

		He settled there as a physician in
1844	DATE	, and was made
Lee	PERSON	's
Reader of Anatomy	ORGANIZATION	at
Christchurch	LOCATION	.

		His lectures began in
1845	DATE	, and a great impetus was at once given to the movement in favor of a Museum .

		It was felt that the old Ashmolean must be supplanted by a temple worthy of
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Economists opposed the proposal on the ground of cost , the classicists fought it because it was novel , and the theologians condemned it as a subtle device of the evil one designed to sap the foundations of belief .

		Sewell of
Exeter	LOCATION	, '' more Puseyite than
Pusey	PERSON	, '' fulminated against it in a
University	ORGANIZATION	sermon which was too bigoted even for the bigots , and which went far to convince sensible men that the hour for a de - termined stand against the bats and owls of the corporation councils was come .

		To the defenders of the Museum were soon joined men like
Liddell	PERSON	and Professor
Phillips	PERSON	; and early in the Fifties the money was voted , the design adopted , and the first stone of the new building laid by
Lord Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		Once begun , the edifice '' rose like an exhalation , '' glorified by the genius of artists like
Woodward	PERSON	,
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	,
Skidmore	LOCATION	, the brothers
Shea	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Prinsep	LOCATION	,
Monro	LOCATION	,
Morris	PERSON	.

		The Museum 's memorable welcome to the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	was marked by the day of the great
Darwin	PERSON	fight , when the opposing hosts , led respectively by Huxley and
S. Wil	PERSON	- berforce , did battle over the strange hypothesis from morn till dewy eve .

		The Darwinian dis - cussion was of course the event of the week .

		It took place in the large Library , which was packed with expectant humanity eager as always for a fray in which the blows were to be borne by somebody else .

		Professor Hens - low presided , and by his side sat Huxley '' hair jet black , slight whiskers , pale full fleshy face , the two strong lines of later years already marked , an ominous quiver in his mouth , and an arrow ready to come out of it . ''

		Professor
Draper	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, '' eminent , serious , nasal , '' read a paper on Evolution ; after which an irrelevant person rose to say that all theories as to the ascent of man were vitiated by the fact that , in the words of Pope ,
Great Homer	ORGANIZATION	died three thousand years ago .

		To this Professor Huxley sarcastically declined to reply ; so the Bishop of
Oxford	LOCATION	, author of an article in the '' Quarterly '' denunciatory of Darwinism , and the accepted champion of Orthodoxy , took the floor .

		The Bishop , says our author , was '' argumentative , rhetorical , amusing . ''

		He does not appear to have been dignified or profound . ''

		He retraced the ground of his article , distinguished between a working and a causal hypothesis , ' compli - mented ' Professor Huxley who is about to demolish me , ' plagiarized from a mountebank sermon by Bur - gon , expressing the ' disquietude ' he should feel were a ' venerable ape ' to be shown to him as his ancestress in the Zoo : a piece of clever , diverting , unworthy clap - trap .

		In short , the

		Huxley rose , white with anger . '

		I should be sorry to demolish so eminent a prelate , but for myself I would rather be descended from an ape than from a divine who employs authority to stifle truth . '

		A gasp and a shudder through the room , the scientists uneasy , the orthodox furious , the Bishop wearing that fat , pro- voking smile which once , as
Osborne Gordon	ORGANIZATION	reminds us , impelled Lord Derby in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	to an unparliamentary quotation from ' Hamlet . ' '

		I am asked , ' Huxley went on , if I accept Mr.

		Happily the great Darwinian debate at the Museum was not without its humors .

		One ominous pause was broken by the important announcement of an elderly gentleman with a Roman nose that Mr.
Darwin	PERSON	's book `` had given him acutest pain . ''

		A roar of '' Ques - tion ! ''

		overwhelmed him , and he departed and 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, was seen no more .

		Another volunteer rose from the back benches during a lull in the storm , stepped smartly to the rostrum , and asked for a blackboard .

		This was produced , whereupon he , after deep thought , chalked two cabalistic crosses on opposite corners of it , opened his mouth to speak , lost his intellectual bearings , and stood vainly groping in the crypts of memory , until forced to his seat by inextinguishable laughter , the thought he had in him remaining , as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	says , conjectural till this day .

		Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	's sense of humor and keen eye for personal peculiarities lend zest and freshness to his portraits of Oxford worthies , and of these sketches his book forms a varied and amusing , and we dare say in their kind pictorially faithful , gallery .

		The subjects range from genuine notabilities , as
Pusey	LOCATION	,
Newman	PERSON	, the
Arnolds	LOCATION	,
Clough	PERSON	,
Jowett	PERSON	, Lid - dell ,
Max Miiller	PERSON	,
Mark Pattison	PERSON	,
A. P. Stan	PERSON	- ley , etc. , down to mere oddities , like `` Horse '' Kett and `` Mo. ''
Griffith	PERSON	, who were notable mainly because they were odd .

		Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	has a good deal to say about
Pusey	PERSON	, who , we suspect , attracted him more through his pe - culiarities than his intellectual gifts for there is a dash of caricature in his somewhat elab - orate portrait of this spectral and media3val - izing divine : `` Two things impressed me when I first saw Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	close : his exceeding slovenliness of person , ... and the almost artificial sweetness of his smile , con - trasting as it did with the sombre gloom of his face when in repose .

		He lived the life of a godly eremite ; reading no newspapers , he was unacquainted with the common - est names and occurrences ; and was looked upon with much alarm in the
Berkshire	LOCATION	neighborhood , where an old lady much respected as a ' deadly one for prophecy , ' had identified him with one of the three frogs which were to come out of the dragon 's mouth .

		... In con - trast with his disinclination for general talk was his morbid love of groping in the spiritual interiors of those with whom he found himself alone .

		He would ask of strangers questions which but for his sweet and cour - teous manner they must have deemed impertinent . ''

		Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	goes on to relate the Doctor 's attempts to play confessor with a surly groom who used to drive him in and out of
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		This man of Belial gruffly refused to have his '' spiritual interior '' vivisected , and was finally abandoned by the baffled Doctor as a '' repro - bate . ''

		In
Pusey	PERSON	's case the boy was certainly father of the man .

		When a boy -LRB- if such we may call him -RRB- he was once invited by his gratified father to select some valuable present commem - orative of a prize-winning success at school .

		He chose '' a complete set of the Fathers '' !

		His mother used to relate how in the Long Vacations he would sit for hours in a shady corner of the garden reading his folios , with a tub of cold water at hand into which he would plunge his head whenever study made it ache .

		The immersions must have been frequent .

		But we must now take leave of Mr.
Tuck	PERSON	- well 's chatty and multifarious book , recom - mending it as an entertaining repository of familiar talk about old
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, its ways and worthies , from the pen of a shrewd and sym - pathetic observer whose sense of humor and appreciation of the original t -RRB- r the eccentric in conduct and character brightens his pages and freshens his descriptions .

		It would have been easy to make a dull book or a stale one about Oxford in the Thirties ; but Mr. TuckwelPs impressions , being both lively and his own , are worth recording .

		There are sixteen illus - trations , among them some quaint plates after old prints and portraits .

		THE DIAL 105 the tool-house , and the corn chamber for pos - sible articles that could be made to serve a needful purpose . ''

		Was there a dissipated wreck of a table , I took it firmly in hand and said ' Brace up ; I intend to set you on your feet again , and shall put new life into you : there is a happy future awaiting those who behave themselves . '

		Was there a chair with an amputated leg or disintegrated vitals ; a little surgical attention , a few stitches and supports , an iron tonic in the form of nails and screws , made another creature of it .

		... With such good-will and purpose did I apply myself to re - formatory work that the lame and halt stood without a limp , the infirm and decrepit assumed a jaunty air of youth , the tramps of the corn chamber became useful and reliable members of our household . ''

		The masculine partner in the firm of the '' Playmates , '' whom his companion individual - izes by the name of
Adam	PERSON	, doubted the pru - dence of some of the lady 's desperate aims at resurrection , and there arose lively controver - sies waxing at times into actual opposition on his part .

		She scored a victory in every in - stance , as courage and invention deserve to do , and flaunted defiantly his own vindicated prin - ciple '' that economy is the handmaid of the art of living . ''

		After skimming '' off a coating of household articles , enough , if spread thin , to cover the bareness of the cottage '' with the help of the long-buried pieces ingeniously brought back to life , the couple proceeded to set up their penates in the new habitation in the wilderness .

		And now had they been ever so '' inactive '' in the past they were so no longer .

		A second tenet in
Adam	PERSON	's complex creed was borrowed from Emerson : '' Labor is God 's education . ''

		The busy pair toiled with delightful earnest - ness from this time on . ''

		The handmaid as an advance guard preceded us with soap and mop , we following at her heels with paint buckets and carpenter 's tools .

		We painted floors , papered walls , whitewashed ceilings .

		We repainted and covered the furniture , adding curtains , portieres , and rugs to the cottage . ''

		The dilapidated old farm-house speedily as - sumed a picturesque aspect under the touch of such informed and determined fingers .

		The neighborhood was alive with interest as a rational consequence .

		Visitors would say on entering the house : '' ' Have you done anything new since we were here last ?

		We must see it . '

		Mark the wording ; it was never ' Have yon bought anything new ? '

		We made it a principle never to buy the smallest thing we could construct , and in consequence our talents in that direc - tion became enormously developed .

		... I , who had known only the ennui of city life and social amuse - ments , had never conceived of the pure joy this fresh plaything brought . ''

		The final strokes being applied to the in - terior , the outer walls of the old house de - manded attention .

		It was decided to shingle them .

		Adam early took a hand in order to hasten the slow progress of the carpenters .

		Then Eve , who always wanted to do whatever he did , joined in without delay .

		It proved such good fun the carpenters were dismissed , and the two '' had beautiful hours together , each seeing who could do the best work in the quickest time . ''

		It was with reluctance that they gave themselves a respite when both were tired out . '' '

		Just hand me a few of those shingles , ' he pleaded , ` and in about three minutes more I shall have com - pleted my half of this course . '

		During the brief re - prieve , I became so engrossed with my own end of the line that we came nearer and nearer together , until we had not only finished the whole course , but had com - pleted several more .

		We did tear ourselves away at length , and I got eggnog , or fruit and wafers , generally the thing that would take longest to eat , and we sat in the shade while we chattered and laughed ; and then we began the shingling again , which was only play , in - terspersed with discussions on philology and Celtic lit - erature between the strokes of the hammers . ''

		Was it not all a pure idyl ?

		It was bringing the ideal into the real .

		It was making poetry out of the prose of life .

		It was spiritualizing the material , an achievement constantly in view of the '' Playmates , '' who strove to conform in thought and deed to the third prime article in
Adam	LOCATION	's creed : to make each day and each event as picturesque as possible .

		The cottage brought into harmony with ses - thetic tastes inside and out , the diligent pair set to work in the garden , which experienced a similar glorification through the instrumen - tality of seeds from the florist , and wild vines and ornamental trees and shrubs from the adjacent forest .

		Everything grew with won - derful luxuriance , because they put of their own heart and soul into it . ''

		A miserable little thread of a
Virginia	LOCATION	creeper , '' for example , which had been barely able to keep hold on the breath of life in its struggle against thwarting circumstances , under their fostering care threw out stems and branches to the length of fifty feet or more in less than two years , covering the front and sides of the cottage with a rich green mantle . ''

		What a beautiful vine ! '

		people would exclaim .

		What do yon do to it ?

		We have a vine that we have tended for years and ca n't make grow . ' '

		We love it , ' would be my reply ; and then they would look at me with an incredulous smile , not understanding the truth .

		But really there was no further explanation to give , for that was all there was to it . ''

		A unique variation in the Playmates ' diver - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, sified experiences was the uplifting and re - moval of huge rocks which spotted their lawn at too frequent intervals . ''

		The gentle game of bouldering , '' the lady pronounces it , and it began in this wise : '' One says to another , My dear , will you come out just a moment ?

		I want you to keep your hand on a bar ; I have a boulder in the garden that I can not manage alone . '

		The uninitiated partner thinks on the way out , This is a queer thing to ask a woman to do ; this is a man 's work , ' which idea shows that she knows nothing about the game .

		She acquiesces , and acting under directions , with very little expenditure of power on her lever , she takes advantage of every slight gain he makes with his pry , and in less than half a minute they have laid bare to the sunshine that which is older , and has lain longer buried , than the oldest mummy in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		This first triumph having been so easily won , the newly admitted member of the Society for Exca - vation becomes eager for another bout .

		A wily master will play upon the vanity of the neophyte , and will render unstinted praise of her skill and dexterity .

		By a proper stirring of her ambition she will ever be ready to lend a hand in an emergency .

		I know one such teacher , who by dint of encouragement secured the services of an ambitious pupil to exhume fifty boulders , some of them weighing a ton . ''

		It was after much studying of the ways of plants and trees in the woods and fields that the chronicler of the '' Playmates '' settled to her private satisfaction the great problem of the warfare of good and evil in the world .

		While Adam transplanted young cabbages in the garden , she unfolded to him the interpre - tation of life to which the inequality in con - ditions and the tragic struggle for existence in the vegetable kingdom , had conducted her .

		It fills one of the most interesting chapters in the volume .

		As she finds seeming injustice and real suffering present in the lower ranks of being , she is reconciled to their prevalence among mankind .

		It is the law of Nature which she robs of cruelty by the supposition that the germ of the vital principle of life , that which in man we call soul , exists primordially in the plant .

		It rises through ascending grades of the organic world in pursuance of the pro- cess of evolution until it is fit to inhabit the human frame .

		It then chooses the parentage and the environments that will best conduce to its continued development .

		Its destiny from the beginning is to go on and on by successive reincarnations , each new form starting on a level with the highest point attained in its last existence . ''

		To my mind , this accounts for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's apparent indifference to the universal death and wanton des - truction of life in the world .

		Death is a token of growth the means by which spirit escapes and makes its ascent from one form to another .

		Knowing that when a thing dies , death does not involve annihilation of the spirit within , but merely facilitates its progress , Nature calmly sees one prey upon another , assured that the time will come , and it is only a question of time , when it will have less maw and more spirit ... Remember , I do not offer this as final truth , but I do claim that it interprets the seeming warfare of good and evil , that it gives me increasing peace of mind and happiness , and helps me to see a world not suffering , but growing . ''

		One may smile at the insufficiency of the ar - gument , but the force and earnestness with which it is presented command respect .

		That
Adam	PERSON	and Eve are gifted with the artistic sense is early divined , but it is not until close to the end of her story that she discloses her identity with the inventor of the Abnakee rug , the manufacture of which forms an in - dustry for the comfort and profit of women shut away in the lone farmhouses of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Her account of the studious exper - iments which resulted in dyes and designs ap - propriate to the exaltation of the original crude hooked rug is as piquant and clever as everything else she relates .

		The '' Playmates '' have dwelt three summers and a winter in their mountain home , happy in each other and in the simple wholesome life they have led with the quiet and inspiration of Nature around them . ''

		Let us go and do likewise , '' is the involuntary prayer of the reader who is allowed in the pages of their book a glance into their earthly Paradise .

		SONGS OF MODERN
GREECE	LOCATION	.

		* One of the leading British reviews , in com - menting on Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	's '' Songs of
Modern Greece	LOCATION	, '' cites his rendering of '' The Woman of Chios '' as proof of the allegation that the translator must have done his work poorly .

		The writer for the review in question is evi - dently a layman with opinions of his own .

		The truth is that Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	's translations are remarkably accurate and sympathetic .

		They show evidence of his own familiarity with the Modern Greek , and they have been touched up by the hand of Mr.
Gennadius	PERSON	, for years Greek Minister to
London	LOCATION	, beyond whom there is no appeal .

		In reading these translations , one must re - member that the soul of poetry is rather asso - ciation than meaning of words , and that when * SONGS OF MODERN

		THE DIAL 107 the association does not exist , the effect is lost . ''

		The Woman of Chios '' calls up a picture of girls washing clothing by the sea shore , a familiar sight in
Greece	LOCATION	from the times of Xausicaa down , and when a Greek hears it , who knows what image it may bring up before his mind ?

		A little village perhaps , his happy youth , the fishing boats drifting by , the saucy maidens with their lithe bodies and their swing - ing paddles flashing in the sunlight as they beat the clothes .

		Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	has very wisely refrained from rendering these songs into rhymed verse .

		He has used prose in most instances and has thus been able to keep closely to the original .

		He has rendered a distinct service to the student , as many of the words of vulgar vernacular , which can not be found in any of the wretched dictionaries in existence , are thus defined , and their actual use exemplified .

		This is by no means a complete collection , but it gives , on the whole , admirably selected examples in the various departments of Modern Greek folk song , which is , in its entirety , a very rich and interesting field .

		Several omis - sions are scarcely accounted for by the author 's explanation that he has '' avoided including any poems previously published in
Western Eu	LOCATION	- rope . ''

		The previous collections -LRB-
Passow	LOCATION	,
Fau	LOCATION	- riel ,
Legrand	LOCATION	,
Marcellus	PERSON	-RRB- are either out of print or difficult of access .


Lucy Garnett	PERSON	's work is next to useless from the fact that the Greek text does not accompany the renderings .

		A large amount of space is given over to the distiches , those rhymed couplets of which every Greek peasant knows a hundred or more .

		These are extremely typical , but they would be more worthy of the space occupied if a little more care had been used in their selection .

		A prose translation gives a poor idea of a rhymed distich .

		In this case , perhaps the original spirit could have been better conveyed by means of two metrical lines .

		Here are a few of Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	's renderings of these pithy poems which are so useful to the Greek swains when courting : 4 ' Even if them wert a queen thou coaldst not be more graceful : a flower among maidens , the pride of the neighborhood . '' ' '

		Mountains bloom not ; birds sing not ; for my love has deserted me : mourn ye all . '' ''

		School-mistress , please permit my
Helen	PERSON	to come out , that I may see her for one instant ; for my life is ebbing out . '' ''

		I want the sky for paper , the sea for ink to write to thee , my graceful one , all that passes through my mind . ''

		The dance songs being intended for occasions of unrestrained mirth are often risque , some - times quite coarse .

		Among the idyls and love songs , so dear to the heart of the common people , are many that are worthy to be trans - lated by a poet .

		Are there not sweet possi - bilities in this , entitled '' Maria '' ? ''

		The star of Morn was just beginning to shine sweetly , the air to pour forth its perfume on the fair first of
May	DATE	before the songs , the sports , and the dances commenced , when thou ,
Maria	LOCATION	, earnest forward first , first of all .

		`` Thy hair fell in profusion o'er thy milk-white throat , and a fair maidenly rose adorned thy breast . ''

		A year later I went the same way again ,
Maria	LOCATION	; I passed by the desolate church where I saw thee for the first time .

		But , instead of meeting a pretty form , a heavenly , lovely glance , my eyes met a white stone with a cross upon it . ''

		Alone in the desert I knelt close by thy grave ,
Maria	LOCATION	, and kissed it gently .

		From among the scattered flowers I picked one alone a white , pure , and , like thee , virgin blossom and matched it to the one which thon hadst given me from the garden of lilies for cruel remembrance : the one an emblem of death , the other , of youth and beauty , and of joy which , here below , is ever sister to sorrow . ''

		Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	's accompanying text is remark - ably clear and clean , and he has adopted the sensible method of representing elisions by means of apostrophes , following the English style in such words as '' 't is '' and '' are n't . ''

		The comprehension of the foreign reader is thus facilitated .

		An introduction and some quite searching notes , with numerous classical references , com - plete a book that must be a joy to all earnest students of that true dialect of Greek which is known as '' Modern Greek . ''

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Although he dwells longest on his favorite song writers -LRB-
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Franz	LOCATION	,
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, and
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , others are not dwarfed by an overbalancing praise of these few .

		Indeed , it may be laid down as a general principle that in such books as this the legitimate use of comparison stops at illustration and charac - terization .

		As evidence that the author 's opin - ions evince a thorough knowledge of the subject we have but to point to the masterly review of
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		While there may be a few who will contend that the popular purpose for which the book is designed would have been better served by some modifications in the way of both elision and amplification , the volume can never be classed as a compendium of useless knowledge about insignificant composers and antiquated songs .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	has treated his subject conscientiously and enthusiastically , from a practical standpoint , and his treatise is just what he intended it to be : a sort of Song -
Baedeker	PERSON	, with bibliographic foot-notes for the benefit of students who wish to pursue the sub - ject further .

		To try what may be called the emotional analysis of music is to offer a direct and peril - ous challenge to ridicule and cynicism .

		In view of the inherent difficulties it may seem inappropriate , if not unwise , that
Camille Bel	PERSON	- laigue 's volume , `` Musical Studies and Sil - houettes , '' opens with lengthy chapters on '' Sociology in Music '' and '' Realism and Idealism in Music . ''

		The author 's theory is that '' to humanize sound '' is the mission of music , and that it has ever been the effort of great musicians of nature to translate into melodies , rhythms , and chords the impression or the reaction of material things upon us .

		This theory is logical .

		Was it not because
Beethoven	PERSON	had felt and suffered all that there is in life to feel and suffer that he was able to strike chords more full of emotion and pathos than have ever been struck before or since ?

		Both of the essays referred to evince a tireless study of the subjects , and are models of intel - ligent criticism ; yet , after all , there is more unembellished truth spoken in
Joubert	PERSON	's words : '' The more nearly a note or chord , a melody , rhythm , or sonority , touches a human senti - ment or a soul , the more nearly is it ideal , the more nearly is it real , and the more nearly does it attain to the perfection of beauty . ''


M. Bellaigue	PERSON	has shown himself to be one of the most erudite of investigators into the his - tory of music and , more particularly , into the annals of opera in
France	LOCATION	.

		In fact , he is most successful in his studies of the lyric drama , and what he remarks has the value of a keenly - felt personal impression .

		But the attitude of the worshipper , although sometimes serviceable , is not always the best for the critic ; his up - lifted eyes are too likely to see only the head of fine gold , and to neglect the less noble parts of baser material .

		The chapters which furnish the most delight - ful reading are '' Italian Music and the Last Two Operas of Verdi '' and '' Silhouettes of Musicians . ''

		Miss
Orr	PERSON	deserves credit for her admirable translation ; the style is clear and forcible , and , above all , she has the gift which few translators possess when the subject considered is music of always putting the right adjective in the right place .

		It has been pointed out that it would be a vast gain to the growth of taste , and to all forms of art among us , if the present ambition to write books on aesthetics might , in some greater measure , give place to more serious and modest study of nature and standard art , as a means of cultivation and for the sake of cultivation .

		In a volume entitled '' For My Musical Friend , '' Mrs.
Aubertine Woodward Moore	PERSON	-LRB- whom we used to know as ''
Auber	PERSON	Forestier '' -RRB- has compiled a series of essays on music and music culture .

		Its purpose is to indicate how the rational methods applied to - day in other branches of learning may be brought to bear on the music lesson , how reck - less waste of time and effort may be avoided , and how music may gain its rightful place as a beneficent influence in daily life .

		Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	properly expounds the theory that to appreciate music we must possess a definite and systematic knowledge of it as a foundation , and though she does not tell us so totidem verbis , the real object of her book is to spread the opinion that such a knowledge should form part of general education .

		It would be unnecessary to insist on the value of this if it were not widely assumed that assthetic appreciation is a mere matter of taste .

		The chapters on '' Rational Methods of Music Study , '' '' The Technique That Endures , '' and '' How to Memorize Music , '' are alike readable and instructive .

		Her work is pervaded by an enthusiasm which gives a peculiar zest to the critical portions .

		The index of twenty pages , in addition to a table of contents , is almost superfluous .

		THE DIAL 109 RECENT BOOKS OF FICTION .

		* Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	has a keen sense of the charm of the unexpected .

		He has essayed so many manners that we anticipate some sort of a surprise whenever a new hook appears hearing his name .

		For a time he seemed to delight in the kind of realism that is dear to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and his skilful handling of unpromising material elicited our some - what unwilling admiration when The Cliff Dwell - ers '' and '' With the Procession '' came to hand .

		But the creator of Pensieri-Vani and the
Chatelaine	LOCATION	was obviously a romanticist at heart albeit of a fantastic and refined type so that we are not sur - prised to find in `` The Last Refuge '' a reversion to the romantic manner .

		The story opens enter - tainingly with the description of a certain Freiherr of middle age , who finds his capacity for aesthetic enjoyment waning , and who seeks a sort of vicari - ous rejuvenation in the companionship of a youth in whom enthusiasm is undimmed , and upon whom the primal impulses of life act with undiminished force .

		To these two characters others are soon joined , each animated by a special idealism , and in search of the conditions under which it may be real - ized .

		For one reason or another , the fair island of
Sicily	LOCATION	appears to the imagination of all these people to be the spot of which all are in search to each of them individually it is a sort of ' last refuge '' in a hitherto baffled quest .

		To Sicily they all repair , and their paths converge to the same ducal estate , where they find themselves gathered together under the game roof , and where they indulge in artistic revels .

		We leave the reader to find out the nature of these diversions and the upshot of the somewhat singular relations that grow up between the char - acters concerned .

		It must suffice us here to em - phasize the charm of Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's manner , and the fact that he has again -LRB- as in his first books -RRB- produced something that almost deserves the name of a new variety of literary composition .

Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	.

		So peculiar a blend as this is not often met with , and we give it welcome as a relief from the innum - erable story-books written upon conventional lines .

		There could not well be a greater contrast than is offered by placing this book side by side with Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's latest novel .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	, we know by this time , will not surprise us , what - ever else he may do .

		In `` The Eagle 's Heart '' he is the same plain blunt man that he was in Main -
Travelled Roads	ORGANIZATION	, '' and has acquired little more of art than he had at the outset of his career .

		The sense of humor was left out of his composition , and of the finer graces of style his work has remained ioi - pertnrbably innocent .

		But he has other qualities , qualities of earnestness and rugged force , that are impressive , and never made by him more impressive than in this straightforward story of the wild free life of the Western cattle ranges .

		The cowboy period of our Western civilization is fast becoming a matter of history , and Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has done us a service in thus preserving its spirit in a form that may make it seem real and vivid to coming genera - tions .

		There is even poetic feeling of a sombre sort in some of his descriptive pages , and a realiza - tion of the elemental and abiding forces in human character .

		Of characterization in the minuter sense in which the art of the novelist understands it there is little or nothing .

		The people of whom he writes are not convincing presences the eagle-hearted hero possibly excepted but rather lay figures decked out in such sentiments and attributes as the writer thinks appropriate to them .

		In a word , they are not viewed from within , but rather from the outside , and with somewhat unsympathetic vision .

		Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	has written many ex - cellent books of popular history , and is well-equipped for this work .

		But it is one thing to write a con - fessed history , and quite another to write a historical novel , and for the latter task Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	does not seem to possess the necessary qualifications , if we may judge by his '' Pathfinders of the Revolution . ''

		This book deals with
Sullivan	PERSON	's expedition , made in
1779	DATE	, into the country of the Six Nations , an ex - pedition which broke the power of the Iroquois allies of the British , and proved an important fac - tor in the eventual triumph of the Revolutionary cause .

		The matter of this book is of great interest , and Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	has shown himself an accurate student of the subject .

		But his manner , from the point of view of the art of fiction , is not that of the successful story , and he is obviously out of his ele - ment in attempting to write one .

		A single illus - tration will suffice to make our meaning clear .

		A considerable part of the narrative is made up of letters from the actors to their friends at home , and Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	thinks nothing of beginning a letter at the end of one chapter , and continuing it into the next .

		The composition must be sawn into equal lengths , no matter what the artistic effect .

		110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	is one of the best of our novelists of American history , but he has done better work than may be found in the book entitled '' In Hostile Red . ''

		The fact that this is an older and shorter story revamped into a full-sized novel probably ac - counts for its lack of proportion , and its extremely uneven quality .

		It is a story of the
Monmouth Campaign	LOCATION	and the operations in and about
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia just before the retirement of Sir
William Howe	PERSON	.

		The central situation is rather effective .

		Two young
Continental	ORGANIZATION	officers , having captured two recently - arrived Englishmen , are led by a reck - less impulse to assume the clothes and the characters of their captives .

		Thus transformed , they make their way into
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and live for some days hand in glove with the British officers .

		At the end they make a clean breast of the affair , and are sent back by
Howe	PERSON	, who is satisfied that they are not spies in the ordinary sense .

		When they interview General
Washington	LOCATION	on their return , they do not get off so easily , and spend the following night under guard , with the pleasant anticipation of being shot at daybreak .

		Having had their scare , which is richly deserved , they are given their liberty .

		The love interest of the novel is supplied by the daughter of a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	merchant , a young woman who pretends to be a royalist , but is at heart a patriot , and , as such , more than once in - strumental in helping the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	forces to carry out their plans .

		`` Who Goes There ? ''

		by Mr.
B. K. Benson	PERSON	, is the story of a spy in the serious sense , and the time is that of the earlier period of the Civil War .

		The hero is a young man who suffers occasional lapses of memory , which may last for months or years .

		One of these attacks comes upon him when he is within the Confederate lines , and , as a conse - quence , forgetting that he is a Union soldier , his recollections revert to the time of his boyhood , which had been passed at school in a Southern city .

		He fights for a time in the ranks of his new - found friends , when accident restores him to his Northern comrades and to the memories that had failed him .

		The psychological part of this study is rather clumsily managed as a whole , although it becomes effective when it deals with the mental struggles of the hero to reinstate the section of conscious memory which he dimly feels to be miss - ing , but to which no clue seems obtainable .

		The fighting part of the story is given up to a great deal of the minute detail of skirmishing , and of battle - incidents as they appear to the individual partici - pant ; there are no broad effects , and there are no episodes of absorbing interest .

		The fourth American war story on our list is the ''
Crittenden	PERSON	'' of Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Here , at last , is a book written in the spirit of art not a great book , by any means , but a pleasant one , and dis - playing a talent for literature that sets it upon a far higher plane than any of the three previously mentioned .

		It is strictly up-to-date in its theme , being concerned with the war in
Cuba	LOCATION	, and having the
San Juan	LOCATION	charge for its culminating episode .

		It takes the popular view of that war and its heroes , a view which the author evidently holds in all sin - cerity , but which is possible only when we shut our eyes to the mad passion which brought the war upon us , and to the sinister administrative influences that shaped its developments .

		If we knew nothing of these things , we should be carried away by the fine enthusiasm of the book , besides being capti - vated by its tender poetic sentiment .

		It is probably as wholesome a book as could be made out of the material offered by our unfortunate war with
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Richard Yea-and-Nay '' is a work of fiction that seems in strange company when grouped with the artificial productions of current romance .

		It is a book of flesh-and-blood , a book of marvellous insight into a vanished historical period , a book of creative imagination in a very high sense , a book which possesses such distinction of style as few modern writers have at their command .

		The judg - ment which has prompted so sound a critic as Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	to single this book out as pre - eminent among all the writings of the past year is hardly to be disputed , and those who come under the spell of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's vivid pages must feel that they are in the presence of veritable genius .

		It is not too much to say that the figure of Coaur - de-Lion is now made for the first time a real pres - ence in the world of romantic reconstruction of the past , a saying ventured with all due reverence to the memory of
Scott	PERSON	, and of such lesser story-tellers as have attempted to deal with this complex and fascinating personality .

		And what we may say of
Richard	PERSON	may be said with almost equal truth con - cerning
John	PERSON	and
Henry	PERSON	the father of both , con - cerning the fair
Jehane	PERSON	and
Berengaria of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bertrand de Born	PERSON	, and a host of other person - ages .

		It was the troubadour just mentioned who fixed upon
Richard	PERSON	the name that serves Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett as a title for his work , and the strange self - contradictions exhibited by that masterful ruler are portrayed with a power that almost places this book in a class by itself .

		The archaic and incisive char - acter of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's diction is in itself a triumph of art , and the art is one so difficult that it comes as a sort of shock to the reader of easy conventional romance .

		One thing is clear : this is no book to be skimmed , but one to be read word for word , and deeply pondered at that , if the reader wish to pos - sess himself fully of its import .

		Thin indeed , and hopelessly unreal , in compari - son with Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's extraordinary production , seems such a book as Mr.
M. M. Blake	PERSON	's `` The Glory and Sorrow of
Norwich	LOCATION	, '' which is yet a fair example of its class , and not so bad a romance after all .

		We would not make it suffer unduly by setting it in this unfair juxtaposition , and hasten to say that the generality of those who read historical fiction for their entertainment will be likely to find their satisfactory account in this tale of the days of
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ill the third
Edward	PERSON	, the French wars , and the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Albert Lee	PERSON	, who wrote '' The Key of the
Holy House	ORGANIZATION	, '' has again taken a theme from the history of the Dutch uprising against the Spanish oppressor , and produced , in ''
King Stork	PERSON	of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, '' a historical novel of more than usual interest and merit .

		King
Stork	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , the Duke of
Anjou	LOCATION	, whom the great Prince trusted with such unfortunate consequences , and the story deals with Spanish intrigue , and the deeds of the familiars , and the exploits of the beggars , all deftly interwoven with the private romance which gives unity to the story .

		But we feel all the while that the real hero is
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, and when that heroic leader at last becomes the victim of the assassin foiled so many times we care little for the outcome of the book as far as the other characters are concerned .

		When we reviewed '' A
Kent Squire	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Frederic W. Hayes	PERSON	, a few months ago , we com - plained that the romance had been hurried to a conclusion without resolving half of the perplexities in which the plot had become involved .

		It seems that our judgment was over-hasty , for the author never really meant to leave us thus unsatisfied , as is now evidenced by his '' Gwynett of Thornhaugh . ''

		This romance takes up the threads that were drop - ped in the earlier volume , and proves a worthy successor to that fascinating production .

		Its period is the year or two following the death of the
Roi Soleil	ORGANIZATION	.

		and it deals , among other material , with the Jacobite rising of
1715	DATE	, the last impotent efforts of
Marlborough	LOCATION	to turn traitor , and the whole web of intrigue that characterized the early years of the Regency .

		The scene is mostly in
France	LOCATION	, and the adventures of
Ambrose Gwynett	PERSON	are quite as sur - prising as '' A Kent Squire '' would naturally lead us to expect .

		The Regent himself , however , is the most interesting figure of all , and is presented to us in a more favorable light than history would seem to warrant .

		The suggestion may seem far - fetched , but we have been more than once reminded by him of the use which Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	makes of the figure of Petronius in '' Quo Vadis . ''

		That is , he says most of the good things , and is the most attractive of the characters presented .

		It has seemed to us fair to say that this novel , taken to - gether with its predecessor , comes nearer than almost any other English product has done to re - producing the characteristic charm of the romances of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	.

		There is the same brilliancy of invention , the same intimate familiarity with the public and private life of the period concerned , and , we regret to add , the same readiness to resort to illegitimate sensational devices .

		Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	had no need of endowing his hero with quasi-miraculous powers ; he would have been interesting enough without them .

		As for the episode of the messe noire , we can only say that the grewsome picture offered is only in part atoned for by the striking manner of the presentation .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		American , and Two historical works intended for popular reading and instruction have beeQ written by Mr .


Edwin Erie Sparks	PERSON	, associate professor of history in the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		One of these is given the timely name of '' The Expansion of the American People , Social and Territorial '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and is a dispassionate account of the ex - tension of the English-speaking people over the North American continent , a preliminary chapter or two introducing the more specific questions re - lating to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the modern manner , Dr.
Sparks	PERSON	refrains for the most part from philoso - phizing .

		What philosophy is to be gained from the book is hardly that peculiar form of pessimism which has been masquerading recently under the phrase , '' the higher morality , '' but it is of the sort which will give comfort to the advocates of that persuasion .

		In the later chapters of his book , those dealing with the recent assumptions by the Amer - ican Government of the policies of
Europe	LOCATION	, Dr.
Sparks	PERSON	sees only obedience to laws which have , throughout history , governed the conduct and decay of nations .

		Judging the future by the past , he even prophesies the retention of
Cuba	LOCATION	as a part of the territory under the American flag , with other dependencies to be governed in the European man - ner , while the
United States	LOCATION	lays off her garment of national righteousness for the uniform of the soldier and the acceptance of the title '' world power '' in the continental sense . ''

		We can not escape it , '' writes the historian , `` because we have no desire to escape it . ''

		The other book from this same hand is styled '' The Men Who Made the Nation '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and is a history in the more usual sense .

		The name given the book is slightly misleading .

		The various chapters bear each the name of the leading American of one specific period .

		It is natural to think each chapter , therefore , an essay upon the individual whose name it bears .

		Rather is the work a homogeneous whole , begin - ning with the voyages of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	to
England	LOCATION	as the agent of the American colonies and ending with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, the name at the head of each chapter serving as a means of identifying the precise era .

		The numer - ous illustrations in both volumes are appropriate and interesting .

		_ During the years from
1891	DATE	to
1897	DATE	M -
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	gave to the public six ample volumes on the history of the different nations of
Europe	LOCATION	during the nineteenth century .

		The volumes were reviewed at length in our columns , and a favorable judgment was pronounced upon them as being of much interest and usefulness to the general reading public .

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	makes no pretensions to historical research and disclaims technical training .

		But through a long life she has mingled in the best social circles of
Europe	LOCATION	, and has thus been able to 112 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, tell the story of
Europe	LOCATION	during the century largely from the inside , and with the grace that comes from such social experience .

		She has now issued a volume made up of supplements to these hooks , with the title '' The Last Years of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		From the nature of her task the author has not been able to invest these brief supplements with the charm of the original chatty volumes .

		They have been compiled from newspapers and magazines , and from the notebooks of
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	,
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	, and others , thus lacking freshness as well as the per - sonal element .

		The volume is , however , of value for reference where the facts are undisputed , and some parts of it are full of interest for the story they tell , especially the account of
Lord Kitchener	ORGANIZATION	's Soudan campaign .

		There is quite a complete nar - rative of the Boer war .

		Altogether , the book is a valuable one , and we are glad Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has added it to her series .

		Two more of the compact , pleasant little '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are at hand , one dealing with
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, from the pen of the Hon.
Thomas E. Watson	PERSON	, of
Georgia	LOCATION	, and the other with
Ulysses S. Grant	PERSON	, written by Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	writes a readable book , but from the outset seems burdened with the thought that his space will not avail for a proper treatment of his subject .

		He avoids controversy , and in doing so fails also to present
Jefferson	PERSON	as the greatest original political philosopher this country has ever produced . ''

		I have no space , '' Mr.
Watson	PERSON	re - marks in his preface , `` for his speculative opinions , for his political theories , for his daring suggestions in science , mechanical arts , education , and state socialism . ''

		The collectivists have been saying that if
Jefferson	PERSON	were alive to-day he would be of their number .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	here goes further , and his own views being well known , it seems a pity that he could not have hinted somewhere what it is in the great individualist 's writings that gives support to '' state socialism . ''

		There seems to be a certain lack of sympathy throughout the narrative .

		But the intention to be wholly fair and impartial is also manifest , and nothing before the people to-day con - tains so much worth reading in as little room , so far as
Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	is concerned .

		To devotees of the leader of the Northern armies ,
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's book will doubtless seem lacking in sym - pathy as well .

		To lovers of mankind it will be a treasure , and the biographer has done an honest and a daring thing in telling the truth .

		He gives the real reason why Grant left the army before the war , and shows him as he was in
Galena	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	, a man without a future and on the downward grade in fortune .

		From that to the presidency , where fortune did not smile upon him , traversing in the meantime the heights of military glory , and subse - quently receiving the homage of the world in his extended tour , thence to his pitiful failure as a financier and his partial triumph over death in completing his wonderful memoirs , Grant 's career is eminently human , and can gain nothing by con - cealment of the obvious facts .

		Both of the small volumes are carefully printed and bound , charac - teristic portraits of their subjects serving as frontis - pieces .

		, - , - \ T-VT cine -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , Dr.
Joseph Frank Payne	PERSON	now adds the life of
Thomas Sydenham	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Payne	PERSON	prepared the article in the
Dictionary of National Biography	ORGANIZATION	on this eminent seventeenth century leech and warrior , and the present volume is an expansion of that article , much more in detail and adding many documents complete from which insight into the life of the physician and his times can be gained .

		The times , indeed , were interesting , and few did more to make them so than the Syd - enhams .

		They were frankly on the side of the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and
Thomas	PERSON	left
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	before gradu - ation in order to take part in the border warfare then waging in his native county of
Dorset	LOCATION	.

		Later the field of revolt broadened and the exertions of the Sydenhams with it .

		Of this family , five brothers served on the independent side ,
Colonel William	LOCATION	, Major
Francis	PERSON	, Major
John	PERSON	, and Captain
Richard	PERSON	, the latter in a civil capacity , ranging themselves with
Thomas Sydenham	PERSON	, who himself gained the ' rank of captain , a fact which Dr.
Payne	PERSON	has been among the first to bring to the world 's attention .

		With this goes the further fact of service in the second war , after a time spent in the rehabilitation of
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		The wars over , the trooper went to his study of medicine in
Montpellier	LOCATION	, and thence to
London	LOCATION	, where he accumulated an excellent practice and , in good part , prepared those treatises on dis - ease which have gained him the world 's esteem .

		The book is in every way a worthy one .

		In his recent volume , ''
London	LOCATION	Mem - ories '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles W. Heckethorn	PERSON	is not quite so happy as in his preceding book noticed last year in these columns , ''
London	LOCATION	Souvenirs . ''

		It is , perhaps , as full of valuable information not easily accessible else - where , and it has the distinct advantage of a good in - dex ; but the subject matter has not so much living interest , since it is less a transcript of life , and houses and bridges and priories figure in it more than men and women .

		Some of the chapters are , '' Horrors of Old
London	LOCATION	Executions , '' `` Old
London Hermi	PERSON	- tages , '' ''
London	LOCATION	's Immortal Animals , '' and ''
Wells	PERSON	and Springs in Old
London	LOCATION	, '' titles sufficiently sug - gestive of the character of the book .

		Mr.
Hecke	PERSON	- thorn has collected a great deal of matter of curious interest and presents it pleasantly , although per - haps at times his style has too much the air of col - loquial carelessness .

		For the student of manners and customs it will be of real value , and the general reader will find in it much to surprise him as well as much to give him occasion for reflection , so great Manners and customs of old

		Glimpses of Three Nations '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of a volume on
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The hundred pages devoted to the great world centre are brimful of information about
London	LOCATION	as a hustling , bustling commercial city .

		One can almost walk the streets and see over again the crowded thoroughfares , hear the confused roar of the ve - hicles , and experience the unparalleled prevalence of dirt .

		The English people , however , almost en - tirely escape characterization .


Paris	LOCATION	, on the other hand , is described in a characterization of its people .

		The boulevards , caf ^ s , and races , are depicted in the manifold and multiplex French character , who frequent such places .

		The author went about with eyes and ears open , and with rare skill describes just what he saw and heard in the great French capital .


Berlin	LOCATION	receives slight attention , but the German people , and especially the army , come in for liberal treatment .

		Precision , plenty of time , and authority , seemed to him to be about the most striking traits of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	's army impressed him as the best organized and the most formidable among the nations of the earth .

		He was apparently awe-stricken thereby , and sounds a note of warning to
England	LOCATION	.

		Though somewhat scrappy at times these glimpses are good reading .

Emma Marshall	PERSON	-LRB-
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a popular and wholesome writer in the genre of domes - tic fiction , whose two hundred or so volumes afford a purer and saner form of enjoyment than the more highly spiced wares which the popular taste now asks for .

		In more than one regard Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	's placid and uneventful , yet in its gentle way strenuous and earnest life , recalls Mrs.
Oli	PERSON	- phant 's .

		It was the lot of both these excellent women and devoted mothers to ply unceasingly the laboring oar in behalf of their loved ones ; both toiled on with unflagging cheerfulness to the end .

		Happily , public appreciation of the fruit of their efforts was not lacking ; so that in both cases one is spared the painful record of actual privations and hope deferred .

		Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	's life was mostly spent in the cool seclusion of cathedral cities , in the shadow of their reposeful minsters , and within the sound of the chimes which one seems to hear echo - ttoryoja quiet i \ fe .

		ing from the pages of the books in which she mir - rors the life in these '' pleasant places '' where the spirit of an age more devout than ours still broods .

		The author has divided her narrative under the chapter-headings
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Wells	LOCATION	,
Exeter	LOCATION	,
Glouces	PERSON	- ter ,
Bristol	LOCATION	each chapter thus embracing the period spent by Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	in the town indi - cated .

		In fine , the volume is a readable one in its unpretentious kind , engagingly written , and strewn with letters not uninteresting in themselves and worth preserving for the sake of the signatures they bear .

		The pleasing illustrations call for special notice .

		We do not know if youths nowadays , Life m the even in the sea-board towns , are so tnercndnt semce ... ... commonly bitten with the yearning to '' go to sea '' as were youths of a half-century or less ago .

		But to those who are so bitten we can honestly recommend Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	's little book entitled '' The Men of the Merchant Service '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- as precisely the one for them to read , mark , learn , and inwardly digest , before setting foot on the first ratline of the arduous ascent to maritime prosperity .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	has aimed to supply the want of a comprehensive , readable , and so far as possible untechnical account of the con - ditions of life in the
Merchant Service	ORGANIZATION	, to which the boy who means to go to sea , or who thinks he might possibly like to go to sea if only he could get a fair notion of what sea-faring is like before - hand , may turn with confidence ; and Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	has succeeded , as usual .

		Conditions on steamships and sailing-ships -LRB- Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	confesses to a pardon - able predilection for the `` wind-jammer '' -RRB- , on '' tramps '' and on liners , the duties and qualifica - tions of Masters , Mates , Bos ` uns , Carpenters , Sail - makers , Stewards , Cooks , Able and Ordinary Sea - men , Engineers , '' Boys '' the entire personate of the merchantman , in short , are discussed in detail , and with the authority of ample experience .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	writes most interestingly , and his book stops a gap in sea literature .

		A book of whale * .

		No better title could have been found for Mr.
F. A. Beddard	PERSON	's really erudite work than A Book of Whales '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Not only is it all it asserts itself to be , but it is the first book in the English language devoted exclusively to a popular account of these large , useful , and good-natured beasts .

		Mr.
Beddard	PERSON	is convinced that the biggest of the existing species of whales ,
Sibbald	PERSON	's rorqual , is the largest living creature of which the earth has record , not even the Jurassic period with its wealth of monstrous reptiles having any brute transcending it .

		While the work is sufficiently technical , it is not without much interest from a purely popular point of view .

		A section devoted to the blood - thirsty grampus , which fearlessly attacks its larger cousins , has some of the fascination of Hugo 's story of the big squid .

		It is interesting , too , to read THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, that evolution seems to point to the ancestral or potential whale as being akin to the armor-clad armadillo or pichiciago , possibly through the glyp - todonts .

		As a whole the book is clearly written , and it is a worthy addition to the '' Progressive Science Series , '' of which its author is the general editor .

Stephen Crane	PERSON	's vigorous pen pur - sued a brief but notable career .

		It is therefore with the greater interest that we examine the con - tent of the present volume .

		Nine great battles are described with more or less detail .

		They are
Bunker Hill	ORGANIZATION	,
Vittoria	LOCATION	, the
Siege of Plevna	ORGANIZATION	, the Storming of
Burkersdorf Heights	LOCATION	,
Leipsig	LOCATION	,
Lutzen	PERSON	, the Storming of Badajos , the brief Campaign against
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and the Battle of Salferino .

		But it is with a sense of disappointment that we lay down the book .

		The author in most of the cases is not the same vivid portrayer of events that we have been accustomed to see in his other works .

		There is a kind of unevenness in the style , almost a lack of energy in places , that grows wearisome .

		But in a few cases , as those connected with the Swedish Campaign , and the battles of Leipsig and
Lutzen	PERSON	, there is more wholesouledness and movement that grips the reader and carries him on to the end .

		This posthumous work will not increase its author 's reputation , but it is a treasure to his friends because it embodies some of
Crane	PERSON	's last literary work .

James jj MacLaren	PERSON	's '' Put up Thy Sword '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , the author decides , somewhat obviously , in favor of peace as against war .

		That such a demonstration should be neces - sary at the beginning of the twentieth century is , perhaps , the most remarkable thing about the book .

		All the ground has been thoroughly threshed over by the wise in former ages , all the pleas for war as a development of character have been answered by the statement , attributed to President
David S. Jordan	PERSON	, that all
America	LOCATION	's wars then should be civil wars , in order to give ourselves the entire good of them ; and the whole matter seemed settled in the estimation of thoughtful men and women long ago .

		But the appearance of this compact little volume makes it apparent that there is still demand enough for a knowledge of the
Ten Commandments	ORGANIZATION	and the Golden Rule to warrant its publication .

		Letioni in rational comfort .

		A sensible and timely plea away from the '' strenuous life '' to one of common sense makes up Mrs.
Mary Perry King	PERSON	's `` Comfort and Exercise '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The lesson that so many Ameri - cans need far more than they do a gospel of nervous prostration and paresis is one of rational comfort , whether in education , at work , for the home , in dress , or during the time for exercise .

		Each of these topics forms a chapter of this pleasantly written book ; and it seems certain that our civilization would be advanced by the adoption of many of Mrs.
King	PERSON	's suggestions , even to the point of toeing straight ahead instead of toeing out .

		The best of the teaching in the book goes to prove that comfort and money are not necessarily synonymous terms , a fact which makes all reform in our national habits possible if it can ever be realized .

		A readable `` Eton '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
A.	PERSON	sketch of Glutton-Brock , is a compendious but
Eton College	ORGANIZATION	.

		readable historical and descriptive account of the famous school where
Udall	PERSON	and Keate flogged , and
Shelley	PERSON	mused , and which Gray celebrated in a poem that Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	disparaged .

		This is the third volume in the '' Great Public Schools '' series , the object of which is to give a brief yet for the general reader satisfactory account of these schools as they are to-day .

		Mr.
Glutton	PERSON	-
Brock	PERSON	outlines in his opening chapters what it is essential to know of
Eton	LOCATION	's historic past ; but his space is mainly devoted to describing the present buildings , studies , usages , etiquette , sports , and so on .

		The forty-six photographic plates are fairly good in their kind .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mrs.
Margaret E. Sangster	PERSON	has her own audience , gained by many years of careful , thoughtful work .

		Her '' Winsome Womanhood '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- carries on the work with which her name has been associated , being addressed to women of all ages from fifteen years onward to the point where , her work as wife and mother done , she is '' waiting for the angels . ''

		Photographs of great beauty and artistic posing from the faces and figures of beautiful women and girls add to the attrac - tiveness of the book , which is one of much spiritual significance .

		The sentiments contained in Mr.
Austin Bierbower	PERSON	's '' How to Succeed '' -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- do him every credit , and the world would be a happier , a better , and a wiser place if it should adopt them literally .

		While lacking any striking originality , the book is based on the fun - damental moralities of the existing world rather than on the teachings of Jesus , which contain too lofty an ideal , seemingly , to be '' practical . ''

		It would be hard to imagine a book based on the certain knowledge that the rich have no more chance in the Kingdom than the camel has to pass through the eye of a needle , with the unavoidable inference that riches are to be shunned as
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	is to be sought !

		The
Baltimore	LOCATION	'' Sun '' is planning to make a some - what more elaborate feature of its literary criticism than is usual with daily newspapers .

		Beginning this month , it will have a page or more of such matter every week , under the editorship of Dr.
Guy Carleton Lee	PERSON	, of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, with the collaboration of many writers from the various colleges of the country .

		This is the way in which the thing ought to be done , and we wish that other journals would follow so excel - lent an example .

		Most of the matter has been reprinted before , but there are a few additions , and we are glad to have ''

		The
Carnegie Library of Pittsbnrg	ORGANIZATION	send us a '' Graded and Annotated Catalogue of Books in the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburg	LOCATION	for the use of the City Schools . ''

		It is a most helpful publication , and other large city libraries would do well to imitate the example thus set for them .

		The Oxford edition of '' La Divina Commedia , '' pub - lished by Mr.
Enrico Frowde	PERSON	, contains no word of En - glish .

		It gives us Dr.

		That old-time favorite , Sir
George Webbe Dasent	PERSON	's translation of '' The Story of Burnt Njal , '' has been re - produced by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an attractive edition , which , we regret to say , omits the maps and plans , the appendices and index , and has even cut down the preface to much less than its original dimen - sions . ''

Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	during the campaign of
1858	DATE	.

		It reproduces both the newspaper clippings and the auto - graph notes which the owner put into it , and constitutes a curious and interesting souvenir of the great President . ''

		Who 's Who '' for
1901	DATE	appears with commendable promptitude , and is supplied in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is indispensable as a book of ref - erence concerning living Englishmen , and a sprink - ling of American names gives it some degree of special usefulness on our side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		But this feature does not make our own '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' any the less indispensable .

		With close attention to the words and rhythms of the original , and an almost exact reproduction of the rhymes , Mr.
J. M. Morrison	PERSON	has translated '' The Poems of Leopardi , '' into acceptable English .

		Only three of the thirty-four '' Canti '' are omitted from this version , which is to be commended for its faithfulness to the text , and for the not infrequent felicities of its diction .

		Messrs.

Samuel Albert Link	PERSON	's '' Pioneers of Southern Literature , '' published by
Messrs. Barbee & Smith	ORGANIZATION	,
Nashville	LOCATION	, deals with various war poets , humorists , and political writers , and with one great singer .

		The chapter on
Poe	ORGANIZATION	will naturally attract the most attention , but the other chapters are the more valuable for students of our literature , merely because they present much information not easily ac - cessible elsewhere .

		150 PUBLIC SCHOOL LEGISLATION IN
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		The attention of the
Illinois Legislature	ORGANIZATION	will soon be occupied by a number of bills relating to the
State	ORGANIZATION	system of public schools , and it may be expected that the educational pot will boil briskly at
Springfield	LOCATION	during the present month .

		Besides numerous bills of minor im - portance already before the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, there will soon come up for consideration three measures of the utmost significance , for the consideration of which the legislative mind will need all of its wisdom .

		The measures in question are these : First , the appointment of a
Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the purpose of unifying and modernizing the school law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, second , a revision of the so-called pension law of
1895	DATE	, and third , a comprehensive measure prepared for the special needs of the school system of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		If the Legislature shall deal intelligently and soberly with these three great questions , the result ought to prove of incalculable benefit to the educational interests of the community .

		The resolution for the appointment of a
State Commission	ORGANIZATION	is a recognition of the cha - otic and patchwork condition of the existing school laws .

		Made from time to time , as special exigencies have arisen , these laws have never been subordinated to any set of control - ling principles , and leave many essential things unprovided for things demanded by the present condition of public education , and in many cases already incorporated into the sys - tem , although without express statutory au - thority .

		The school law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, in its existing form , is a thing of shreds and patches , at least a generation behind the age in many of its aspects , and self-contradictory at more than one point .

		It is greatly in need of in - telligent revision , and now seems likely to obtain it .

		To give but a single instance of its shortcomings , we may say that it gives no specific authority for schools of secondary edu - cation , although public opinion long ago settled the question of their justification .

		What is needed in this direction is not merely the specific mention of high schools , but a declar - ation similar to that of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	statute , which compels high school education to be provided throughout the State for all who may desire it .

		The other two measures that are to come up for discussion relate only to the schools of cities having over one hundred thousand in - habitants which means , of course , the schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	alone .

		This , it may be explained to the uninitiated , is the ingenious way in which the
Illinois Assembly	ORGANIZATION	gets around the consti - tutional objection to special legislation .

		Such a law , although special in its purpose , is gen - 130 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, eral in form , and does not contravene the con - stitutional prohibition .

		The question of providing pensions or an - nuities for retired teachers of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools does not seem in a fair way of satis - factory solution .

		The existing statute is glar - ingly defective , but the substitute about to be proposed is very much worse .

		What is needed is a simple law , and the substitute is ridiculously complicated .

		What is needed is a law that shall be mandatory in all essential respects , and the substitute leaves large discretionary powers to an elective administrative board .

		The existing law needs to be amended , but the process of amendment should not overload it with intricate subtleties , nor should its whole spirit and purpose be changed thereby .

		If the Legislature deals wisely with this matter , it will make three changes in the present statute , and no more .

		It will make the term of service equal for men and women , iti will make the annuities proportional to the annual assess - ments , and it will remove the slight ambiguity now found in the paragraph which secures permanence of tenure subject to good behavior .

		With these three amendments , the law would be made impregnable as far as the courts are concerned , and it would work automatically for an indefinite period .

		It would not secure a fixed annuity , but it would secure a fair division of the funds annually available among the annuitants .

		To secure fixed annuities of reasonable amount , a very different method must be resorted to ; namely , the method of supplementing the assessments made upon teachers by a diversion of public funds to the extent found necessary .

		If the Legislature really desires to occupy an advanced educa - tional position upon this difficult question , it will adopt the method here suggested , and might do worse than frame its law upon the
New York	LOCATION	model .

		We could not well conceive of anything that would do so much to increase the dignity and stability of the teaching pro- fession in
Illinois	LOCATION	as the adoption of a statu - tory provision securing reasonable annuities to teachers retiring after a quarter-century of service .

		The third measure , and by far the most comprehensive one , to come under the consid - eration of the
Legislature	ORGANIZATION	is the bill drafted under the auspices of the
Civic Federation of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This bill is the product of much thought and investigation , and is , in the main , an enlightened and admirable document .

		Year before last , a Commission of one hundred mem - bers was appointed by the
Civic Federation	ORGANIZATION	for the purpose of examining the whole question of legislation for the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools and the allied question of the methods of their admin - istration .

		This Commission was a representa - tive body , including in its membership men and women , educators and non-educators , clergy - men , lawyers , and men of affairs .

		It has held many general meetings and committee meet - ings , has called in a great deal of expert testi - mony , has listened to much discussion , and has at last framed a comprehensive report .

		A part of this report is the bill now before
the State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	; the remainder consists of admin - istrative recommendations not suitable for legis - lative action , but intended to be addressed directly to the
Chicago Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is with the bill alone that we are now con - cerned , and a few words may be given to the statement of its most important features .

		In the first place , it provides for a reduction of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	from its present membership of twenty-one to nine .

		Such a reduction of membership is in accord with the best professional opinion in this matter , and would bring about the condition of things happily expressed by President

Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	should never consist of more persons than could sit around a table of moderate size , and discuss the ques - tions before them in ordinary conversational tones .

		The bill then provides for the super - intendency by giving its incumbent a legal status , great administrative powers in educa - tional matters , and a long term of service dur - ing which he can not be removed except for some gross ' dereliction of duty .

		The business manager of the schools is also given a legal status , enlarged powers and responsibilities , and tenure for a term of years .

		The certificate of the

		They are all highly desirable features of a school law , and we find open to serious criticism only the one pro- vision that gives to the Superintendent the power , seemingly too arbitrary , of the dismissal

		THE DIAL , 131 of teachers , subject to the confirmation of his action by the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this respect the law now existing is better than the one proposed , for it provides a safeguard for the teacher in requiring written charges , to be investigated by the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, before a dismissal can take effect .

		It is no more than simple justice that this requirement should be insisted upon .

		In voting against it , the Com - mission was carried away , in the words of '' The School Weekly , '' by the eloquence of one or two vigorous personalities who were seemingly controlled by two ideas to the exclu - sion of all others . ''

		One was that the
Chicago	LOCATION	school system was going to the dogs because of a surplus of incompetent teachers .

		The second was that giving to the Superintendent of Schools supreme power would remedy all this . ''

		The simple fact is that it ought to be difficult to dismiss from the schools a teacher who has passed the probationary period .

		Make it as difficult as you will for a person to secure ap - pointment , make the tests as exacting as you please , but when the appointment is given , let there be given with it a sense of security that can not possibly coexist with the power of any one officer to destroy a professional career once entered upon in good faich .

		It is only upon these terms that a really effective service can be built up ; it is only subject to this condition that the best class of men and women can be persuaded to enter the educational ranks .

		What the fate of this measure will be at the hands of the Legislature we do not pretend to say .

		If we may judge by the fate of the not dissimilar bill presented two years ago , the outlook is not hopeful .

		That bill , like the present one , was in the main admirable , and needed , like its successor , only a little judicious amendment to be made a model example of educational legislation .

		But instead of intel - ligent consideration , it received only derision , it was assailed by interested persons in all sorts of mean and petty and unworthy ways , and was finally rejected with contumely .

		Let us hope , at least , that the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	now in office will have a better sense of its dignity and responsibility , and that the new measure will be accorded the respectful attention it so richly deserves .

		Its enactment , after some slight revision , would set
Illinois	LOCATION	in the front rank , as far as educational interests are con - cerned , among our Commonwealths , and would doubtless become , as our Library Act of nearly thirty years ago has become , a model for the imi - tation and the emulation of other communities .

		`` A DISTRESSING MISQUOTATION / ' -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL -RRB- A correspondent -LRB- '' S. '' -RRB- in your issue of
February 1	DATE	tartly refers to what seems to him a lapse ou the part of the editor of '' An American Anthology . ''

		One of
Poe	PERSON	's '' gems '' he finds to be '' marred by one of the most dia - bolical blunders of misquotation in all the annals of printing . ''

		Quoting , from `` To One in Paradise , '' '' And all my nightly dreams Are where thy dark eye glances And where thy footstep gleams , '' he truthfully states that , '' instead of dark ' eye , Mr. S ted man has gray eye . ''

		If '' S. '' will consult the Stedman-Woodberry edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's Works -LRB- the latest complete text -RRB- , he will see that '' gray , '' and not '' dark , '' was the adjective finally used by the author of '' To One in Paradise . ''

		Doubt - less
Poe	PERSON	might have stuck to his early draft of that ballad , instead of carefully rewriting it , if he could have known that '' S. '' was to say of '' gray eye glances '' that the '' distressing alliteration would have ruined the fame of Milton . ''

		On page 190 , Vol .

		X. , of the Edition cited , the vari - orum notes show the poet 's many radical emendations , one of which is the substitution in question .

		After my labors with Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	in the editorship of
Poe	LOCATION	, I could hardly be expected to prefer any text before our own , and I would be apt to scrutinize the proof of selections therefrom with unusual care .

		One of the claims of our text to the title of `` definitive '' is that it follows
Poe	PERSON	's own copy of his last book of verse , with the marginal revision by his own hand .

		Occasionally his changes from a crude early draft are open to criticism , but nineteen times in twenty they are most felicitous -LRB- as in the ballad of `` Lenore '' -RRB- .

		Pos - sibly this may not be said of the change from '' dark '' to '' gray , '' yet it will be recalled that
Poe	PERSON	had a pas - sion for alliteration , and , again , that such a change was sometimes determined by other than technical consid - erations .

		In standing by the text of the '' Anthology , '' I may be guilty , but certainly not of the '' blunder '' which is proverbially worse than a crime .

		DR. FITZEDWARD HALL : AN APPRECIATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE Apropos of the recent death of Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	, some brief public expression of appreciation of his ser - vices to students of modern English may be fit and proper , especially as coming from a controversial op - ponent .

		My controversies with Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, although con - tinuing through several years , have passed from notice and , except for a few , from memory .

		But I have long wanted to say something of this kind , and I hope it may be said in THE DIAL , because most of the discussions between Dr.
Hall	PERSON	and myself were printed in its columns .

		It is not necessary to enlarge on Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's attain - ments , his enormous industry , the breadth of his reading , the acuteness of his perceptions , the subtlety and truth - fulness of his distinctions .

		Nobody , I suppose , has ever examined his printed work in English without astonish - ment at the mere labor that produced it .

		Its solid value is unquestionable , in fact , incomparable .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	was the first to show how questions of good and 132 THE DIAL bad English -LRB- to refer to a single line of his pursuits -RRB- must be studied in order to reach safe conclusions .

		If anybody ever got a slight and temporary advantage over Dr.
Hall	PERSON	in discussions of this kind , it was because he had learned the art frt -RRB- tn his master , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	him - self .

		It is no wonder that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's authority became almost papal .

		I have spoken of his acuteness and subtlety .

		He did more than anybody else , more perhaps than all others , in bringing to the attention of American readers obscure , unsuspected differences in sense between American and British uses of the same words .

		He himself was keenly alive to such differences , and combated strenuously the prevalent notion in the
United States	LOCATION	that the differences between British and American English are slight .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's studies were not restricted to English .

		He printed much in other departments .

		But of this I do not venture to speak .

		It seems to me very desirable that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's letters and contributions to periodicals should be re-printed in book form for the shelves of libraries .

		PROFESSOR TRIGQS ON PROFESSOR WENDELL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The communication of Mr.
Oscar Lovell Triggs	PERSON	in THE DIAL of
February 16	DATE	, concerning Professor Bar - rett
Wendell	PERSON	's '' A Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' point - ing out '' the strength '' on which he brought himself to consider this volume , is more complimentary to the writer of the editorial in THE DIAL of
December 16	DATE	to which Dr.
Triggs	PERSON	refers , than to Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's standing in literary and educational circles , perhaps ; but before questioning the questioner I must cry mea maxima culpa , since Pmust be uncomplimentary myself and ac - knowledge that I have read neither editorial nor book .

		However , it has struck me as something to be regret - ted that Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	should have seemed to have con - founded his desire to communicate , with his desire to review Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's book , and Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	's eight little paragraphs of big questions scarcely appear as food for thought so much as for a pedagogic exami - nation test .

		If it is the function of a pedagogue to put questions , it is supposed to be his function to be able to answer them .

		It is forbearance then on the part of Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	, perhaps , that he has not embodied these questions with others , all answered , in a definitive review or a volume on the same subject .

		At least I imagine the time has not yet come for a precise history of our literature , when Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's sins of literary omission shall be made forgotten .

		If Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	actually expects his eight series of questions to be answered , one might remind him , con - cerning one question of the second , that English litera - ture has two meanings .

		The term may be interpreted as literature in English or as literature in
England	LOCATION	.

		I believe Professor
Wendell	PERSON	would have the former sig - nificance in mind in writing such a book as '' A Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' and that may account for his non - consideration of Yiddish literature in
America	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's volume is out of place in its series , '' conceived by an European from an
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean point of view , '' yet not more out of place than a literary ambassador at the court of
St. James	LOCATION	.

		Just what Dr.
Fiske	PERSON	's not being dazzled by kings and queens would have to do with a conscientious effort on the part of Professor
Wendell	PERSON	, is problematical , yet Dr.
Fiske	PERSON	and the others have been wise enough to consider kings and queens , and it is not uninteresting to note the effect
King George III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	had on the life work of Mr.
George Washington	PERSON	of Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	and elsewhere .

		At present it is a question whether a preface should exclude a text , but there is the consola - tion always that second editions are possible .

		As to devoting 479 of 518 pages -LRB- this may include the index ; I do not know -RRB- of a volume of the sort to
BOSTON	LOCATION	-LRB- and
New England	LOCATION	-RRB- , one must cry out '' Let the Punishment Jit the Crime ! ''

		Let Professor
Wendell	PERSON	be compelled to demand a new edition of his book wherein a certain number of pages shall be devoted to chronicling the literary doings of the
United States	LOCATION	county by county , parish by parish , each county and each parish having its own section .

		But where a county or a parish has no literature to present , let the pages assigned to such a county or such a parish remain blank , or decorated with an appropriate quotation from
Walt Whitman	PERSON	or Homer 's catalogue of ships .

		In this man - ner a comprehensiveness might be attained of great in - terest to a leisurely statistician .

		Finally , let Professor
Wendell	PERSON	apologize for forgetting to mention that the West has been won !

		As soon as I finish reading Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	's excellent '' Selections from the Prose and Poetry of Walt Whit - man , '' I will lend it to '' Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	, '' and '' Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	, '' who is now reading Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's book , will exchange with me .

		Perhaps when I come to read '' A Literary History of
America	LOCATION	'' myself , I will under - stand Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	's temptation , but the form of his com - munication seems to me to be in need of absolution .

		OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES : A SUGGESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I have place in THE DIAL for a word to say that I think the work of our public libraries , which you discuss so sanely in your issue of
Feb. 1	DATE	, does not properly cease at the circulating point .

		Especially , in the larger cities , it seems to me , there should be free reading rooms in several different parts of the municipality , accessible for all classes and at all reasonable times of the day and evening .

		The reading room would seem to supplement the circulating feature and add to the usefulness of the library as a whole .

		The free reading room at a central point is practically foreclosed against that class who most need its advantages .

		The laboring people can not go from their homes on the outskirts of the city and get much good from reading after they have done a full day 's work and taken their evening meal .

		Besides , the item of transportation is not incon - siderable for the poorer intelligent classes .

		And an opportunity to keep in touch with current events as they appear in daily and weekly papers , and in the periodicals , ought not to be denied this important and large part of our population .

		The free reading room will do much to lessen gambling and drunkenness , and is a wise policy for any municipality to foster viewed merely from the economic standpoint .

		It is a work that should provoke the active interest of philanthropic persons .

		It is somewhat singular that this democratic move has not awakened a greater impetus among those to whom the stewardship of great wealth has been en - trusted .

		THE LIFE OF
PHILLIPS BROOKS	PERSON	.

		* Dr.
Allen	PERSON	has given us a remarkable biog - raphy in his '' Life and Letters of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	. ''

		He has portrayed a remarkable man .

		Perhaps no richer personality has ma - tured on American soil .

		The biography has great excellences and some obvious faults .

		Like most such works in modern times it is excessive in bulk .

		As if
Hesiod	ORGANIZATION	had never lived , writers refuse to consider the half to be more than the whole .

		Publishers protest and readers complain , but still the volumes grow .

		Sixteen hundred closely printed pages are a good many to devote to one man .

		They might suffice for the chronicle of an important period .

		If
Carlyle	PERSON	thought the days of hero-worship past he should be living at this hour .

		On every page of these volumes are heard the trumpets and shawms .

		The misfortune of being idolized which pursued
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	through his lifetime follows him to his grave .

		While he lived he overtopped the curling incense , and he emerges unharmed above it even now .

		You distinguish the man with all his noble features even when set forth as a demigod .

		It may heighten the verisimilitude of the por - trait to give it the atmosphere which
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	breathed for thirty years .

		Yet above his dear remains there are those who would prefer to see a more severe and chastened monument .

		Nor did the career and personality of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	require copious interpretation .

		Some people need no introduction .

		Before a great landscape , a great picture , a great man , silence is the more reverent homage .

		The admirable cicerone irks us ; our admiration is chilled be - cause demanded .

		We are ready to resent the intrusive interpretation and to look the other way .

		Give us the facts of the great man 's life , what he said and did , what he enjoyed and suffered , the things he liked , the things he hated , and let us sift and group them and make our inferences from them as we may .

		Let us not be thought ungrateful .

		Happily in these volumes there is much to praise .

		After throwing out all that is redundant and irrele - vant , there remains a true vision of a noble man .

		Dr.
Allen	PERSON	knows him as he was .

		When we doubt the biographer 's judgment he has * LIFE AND LETTERS OF

		himself supplied the material upon which to form our own .

		He has made large use of carefully kept note - books and diaries whose existence was unsuspected by lifelong friends , and has drawn so much from them that these volumes might bear the old-fashioned title , '' Life and Remains . ''

		The notes are not shape - less memoranda , but well-wrought paragraphs , not to be likened to the scrawls of an artist 's sketch-book but to delicate and finished draw - ings .

		They indicate in the writer a character - istic sense of form and instinct for perfection .

		There is wealth without exuberance .

		Before
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	was of age he had learned his tools and was a master of expression .

		The earliest notes no more spurt with the spasmodic cleverness of youth than the latest dribble with the enforced parsimony of age .

		It is the flow of a quiet stream , welling up and gliding on : The letters are numerous , not often import - ant or brilliant , but delightful with the charm of slipshod ease .

		They are anybody 's letters , not a touch of art about them .

		They are full of most gracious fooling .

		Precisians will regard them as unduly frolicsome .

		They touch and go lightly .

		They are not crammed with wit or wisdom .

		They are not often quotable .

		For axioms or epigrams you must look elsewhere .

		They are for a friend 's amusement , for the writer 's relaxation .

		They are like good talk , and especially like
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's good talk , which mostly kept the valley road .

		When he would climb peaks or thread crevasses he wrote a sermon or made an entry in a note-book .

		The fire kindled when he mused rather than when he chatted .

		He said what came to the surface and let his fancy loose .

		If too many began to listen , the talk was apt to dissolve in laughter .

		Was the great preacher 's nature as complex as Dr.
Allen	PERSON	imagines ?

		The public instinct is with those who look on it as essentially simple , as simple as his career , which was only except - ional in its felicity .

		Born in the Brahmin caste of
New England	LOCATION	, he inherited through half a dozen generations piety , scholarship , and public spirit .

		He grew up in a household which added deep conviction to plain living and high thinking .

		His mother was a woman of rare almost tragic intensity of spirit .

		His father was a
Boston	LOCATION	merchant of the best stamp , energetic , orderly , diligent , unpretend - ing , a man content with a modest livelihood , of sound sense and conservative judgment , glad to reserve strength and leisure for public aims .

		Through the
Adams School	ORGANIZATION	and the Latin 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, School
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	passed to
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unambitious of college rank , but alert and eager for knowledge and culture , he stood high among his classmates , winning their liking while retaining a certain aloofness and reserve , which in after years wore off the sur - face yet clung to the core of his being .

		After an attempt to teach rough and indocile lads , which proved a failure and caused momentary discouragement Dr.
Allen	PERSON	has perhaps dwelt on the mishap somewhat unduly , he found his lifework in the ministry of the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, in which , from four years old , he had grown up .

		He passed three years at a Semi - nary of that church near
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		They were years of quiet growth , unincumbered by too much instruction .

		Some men are their own best teachers , and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	`` browsed on the sprouts of his own mind , '' pursued his own studies , began to value and record his thinking , and came into knowledge of himself .

		At his graduation he was so easily first among his fellows that there was no doubt of his ultimate rank in the ministry .

		After two years in a somewhat obscure post where he could not be hid , he took charge of one of the foremost parishes in the church , that of the
Holy Trinity	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		He was in no haste to assume larger tasks , but he had no fear of them .

		Under the influence of a great position at a momentous period , the years of the Civil War and of Reconstruction , he grew rapidly .

		He stood firmly for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and for the Freedmen , when it cost something to be outspoken .

		After ten years of rich service , being not yet thirty-five years old , he was drawn back to his native city , there for two and twenty years to preside over an historic parish .

		But he insensibly widened his pastorate to in - clude all who called upon him for his ministries in
Boston	LOCATION	and parts adjacent .

		In the great fire of
1872	DATE	his church was burned .

		The seeming catastrophe became a blessing .

		It precipitated a difficult decision to remove an old parish to a more favorable neighborhood .

		Four years later there had risen , under the spell of his eloquence , at the hands of a large - minded and generous corporation , using the unique gifts of
Richardson	PERSON	the architect and
Lafarge	ORGANIZATION	the painter , a building that marks an epoch in our architecture , the noblest church edifice yet built in this country .

		The building and the man who had no small part in making it what it was went well together .

		It was thronged with all sorts and conditions of men , to whom his word was life .

		There he was as if enshrined or enthroned for the rest of his days , and now it is his monument .

		It seemed as if no more changes could come to him , but upon
Bishop Paddock	PERSON	's death in
1891	DATE	, by common consent of city and state
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	was marked as his successor .

		Those not of his own communion claimed him as '' our bishop . ''

		There was some delay in the con - firmation of the election by the standing com - mittees and the bishops .

		Dr.
Allen	PERSON	has told the story with little comment .

		He has declined to erect a pillory in his pages , however just the right of anyone to occupy it .


Phillips Brooks	PERSON	did not seek the episcopate , yet rather to the surprise of some he welcomed it and rejoiced in a new opportunity .

		He felt it also to be a release from crushing burdens .

		But he had not fully measured its own strains .

		He set himself an exacting standard of official duty .

		He was already overwrought when dis - ease struck an enfeebled frame and found him an easy prey .

		He died after a few days of illness , on the 23d of
January , 1893	DATE	.

		He was fifty-seven years old .

		It was a career whose events were sermons , addresses , lectures , changes of rectorships , refusals of parishes , professorships , and presi - dencies , the building of a great church , and the consecration as Bishop .

		Its relaxations were books , friends , and foreign travel .

		It differed from other ministerial careers less in kind than in degree .

		So with the character formed and revealed by it .

		It differed from the characters of other men in the range , pro- portion , and completeness of its powers .

		It was pure , high-minded , devoted , earnest to enthusi - asm yet ever sound and sane , the temperament and force of genius combined with saving com - mon sense , the habits of industry , fidelity , patience , sobriety , which ensure success in whatever field .

		A large intellect , a right con - science , a commanding will , a noble heart , were fitly tabernacled in a mighty frame that worked without jar or friction almost to the end .

		The whole grand nature was subdued and conse - crated to the one task of living and proclaiming the gospel of Christ .

		If just balance , and equipoise of powers or their concentration upon the highest aim , involve subtlety , the character may be deemed complex ; otherwise it was simplicity itself .

		Very early in his life
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	recog - nized his peculiar powers and the work to which they pointed him .

		It was not the mission of the seer who declares truths which perhaps only posterity may comprehend at their just
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 135 value .

		It was rather that of the prophet who discerns in the religion of his time eternal verities , needing restatement ; who takes the lessons of all time and makes them live again to-day .

		What the marvellous preacher was capable of becoming as a metaphysician deal - ing with fundamental thought , what he might have been as a formal theologian eliciting from Holy Writ its essential dogmas and system - atizing
Christian Truth	ORGANIZATION	, it is idle to inquire .

		Genius is a well-nigh incalculable force , and may apply itself in numberless directions .

		Anyone who would judge the capacity of
Phil	PERSON	- lips
Brooks	PERSON	for abstract thought upon religion may well study the ten pages of the second volume of this biography , in which to clear his own mind he reviewed his religious experi - ence and put on record his inmost convictions in theology .

		Nothing could be simpler or more lucid .

		But while we may believe his genius capable of many things which it left unat - tempted , we must see that its special province was to take great truths out of the rubbish heap of dead phrases , revitalize and freshly illustrate them , and cause them mightily to prevail over the hearts and lives of men .

		There was power for men to live by , if it could only get at them , in the old theology that in this period of the
New Reformation	ORGANIZATION	was everywhere finding restatement and elucidation .

		What had grown obscure and was in danger of be - coming obsolete , what had been familiar in words and was in danger of passing into the realm of cant , what was really new in its form and was in peril of becoming a heresy by standing alone ,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	seized with a certain swift and fine apprehension and re - deemed for the service of life .

		That was his peculiar province in which he stood peerless , the application of truth to common living , bringing Jesus Christ , with all the glow of divine light upon His face , down among every - day men and things .

		As he believed in God the Father of a world of men , so he believed in man the potential Son of God .

		For the lowest , meanest , most germinal type of hu - manity , he cherished an undying hope .

		That large hopefulness was perhaps the salient feature in the character of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	.

		Other men were as brave and devoted , but who was ever as hopeful as he ?

		When others walked in darkness anxious well-nigh to despair , on his face there was no '' glimmer of twilight '' but ever '' glad , confident morning . ''

		Transient sorrows might disturb , immediate difficulties might perplex him , but he had never a doubt as to the final issue .

		Such sure hope was with him both a native gift and a Christian grace .

		And out of such hope grew joyousness irrepressible , lightness of heart free and frolicsome as that of a child .

		It was cheer and courage for all about him .

		It was a per - petual fountain sparkling in the sun and water - ing every thirsty grass-blade and wilting flower .

		Whether he outstretched his hand to greet a friend , to console a mourner , to lead a prodigal home , there was a thrill in the grasp as of a strong glad son of God , delighting in His service .

		How quietly
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	rose above or stood apart from contentions and controversies !

		The unruffled atmosphere of Dr.
Allen	PERSON	's biog - raphy is in just keeping with the life por - trayed .

		Some remote murmur of battle past seems dying away in the distance , but around the great central figure of the scene there is truce or peace .

		Always independent in opinion and frank in utterance ,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	was never bitter in speech nor did he nurse grudges in his heart .

		If he ever seemed to over - emphasize a truth or unduly reject what he thought an error , his spirit was always gener - ous and tolerant .

		Nor was it the tolerance of arrogant unconcern but of honest respect and sympathy , of hearty recognition of neighbor 's right to question what it was his own duty to assert or acclaim .

		He rarely laid stress on the things he rejected .

		He was busy inculcating what he believed God 's truth .

		There might be tempting occasions for firing a volley after a retreating foe , or rolling the drums and flut - tering the flags after an enforced surrender , but
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	had neither time nor heart for such things .

		Dr.
Allen	PERSON	, with a large wis - dom which is habitual to him , tells the story at such times without provocative comments .

		In - deed , there are pages where the reader is dis - posed to inject a little human temper between the mild benignant lines .

		It will be a pity if the younger clergy the young men , indeed , of every calling fail to note the lesson of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's systematic and orderly industry .

		If ever man might trust to slight preparation , it was he .

		His mind worked at lightning speed .

		Lucid utterance seemed instinctive with him , and logical ar - rangement .

		Thoughts never tumbled forth from his mind like apples from a barrel or jackstraws from a box .

		They fell in place .

		From a seminal thought sprang with the ra - pidity of East Indian juggling the stem , branches , and terminal twigs of a shapely tree , THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, each leaflet and each rootlet where the laws of tree life require that they should be .

		I once saw
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	compelled to exercise on the instant his faculty of quick choice and in - stantaneous mastery of a theme .

		Before a large audience he was suddenly called to his feet after a definite promise that he should not be .

		Only on that assurance had he consented to be present .

		Unfortunately the promise had come from a venerable presiding officer , and the call , peremptory and irresistible , issued from a tumultuous throng of young men .

		As the cries for ''
Brooks	PERSON	,
Brooks	PERSON	! ''

		rang out , I saw his face darken , his eyes seemed to look inward for one swift instant , his whole frame quivered and his whole being gathered from all sides its forces to concentrate them upon an intense process of thought .

		Then he rose , drew up that grand form of his to its full height , and as quietly as if the scene had been rehearsed beforehand seemed to distribute his ideas each into its fitting place and began an address as logical in order , as substantial in matter , and as choice in phrase as if he had given hours instead of seconds to its prepara - tion .

		With such electric facility , such gift of instantaneous summoning up the forces of the brain , most men would have felt diligent and laborious preparation for them needless .

		Phil - lips
Brooks	PERSON	never trusted to his genius until humbler powers had done their part .

		He held it in reserve to fuse into a glowing whole what diligent study and thought had accumulated .

		He was as careful and methodical as if he had been dull and undisciplined .

		His study-table was never '' snowed under . ''

		It was as neat as a lady 's dressing table , as a precise bookkeep - er 's desk .

		Its orderliness was typical .

		Dr.
Allen	PERSON	very discriminatingly notes the autobiographical character of Bishop
Brooks	PERSON	's sermons and lectures ; how he confided to the great popular heart what he would withhold from close personal friendship .

		What he saw in himself , with the inward eye which is the bliss of solitude , he revealed as if it belonged to all mankind .

		He was not unaware of his own genius .

		He knew well enough his relative place among men .

		But he perpetually lost sight of it .

		He was a somewhat stern judge of his brethren in the ministry if they fell below his ideal of what a minister should be .

		So easily was he all he was , that he forgot that to lag very far behind him might sorely hurry the pace of those less gifted .

		So as he gave glimpses of the history of his soul it seemed to him that he was only portraying the common processes through which his fellows went , and he made it seem to them as if they had already trod where he was leading them .

		Thus his noblest sermons , so far from dismaying his brethren with the thought of their incomparable power , were to many among them but an inspi - ration .

		Justly has Dr.
Allen	PERSON	emphasized
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's relation to his own church and to the Christian world beyond it .

		So much was he at last '' the Bishop of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' to mul - titudes who regarded Episcopacy askance , to whom his orthodoxy was incomprehensible and his churchmanship a curious and unaccountable accident , that men of his own flock and creed were not unnaturally disposed to question his fealty to his own flag and to ask , Can this man be quite loyal to the Church of the Prayer Book , who is the accepted leader of unliturgical
Christendom	LOCATION	?

		If they will read his little tractate on '' Tolerance '' they will be better able to understand him .

		His attitude toward his own communion and that of others may be well illustrated in words of Daudet quoted by
Rene Dourmic	PERSON	. ''

		Truly I belong to my own boat and I love it , but all those others setting sail or entering port are as dear to me as my own .

		I signal them , I hail them , I try to hold communication with them , for all of us , whether leaders or followers , are threatened by the same dan - gers ; for all our barks the currents are strong , the winds - treacherous , and the night comes down so fast . ''

		Ah , too fast that night came down , it well may seem , on one so well loved and trusted , who bore so clear a light and shone so far .

		The world was indeed indefinitely the poorer by his departure as it had been indefinitely richer for his sojourn .

		But for him it was well to go .

		He had done his work .

		He had sown seed of which coming generations will reap the harvest .

		He enjoyed life , few men more keenly .

		Speaking of one who lingered a little late upon the stage , he wrote , '' One would not like to stay quite as long as he has , but , with the world such as it is , there is great tempta - tion to linger at the feast . '' ''

		Such as it is , '' the world of men and things was very dear to him .

		It was far from a perfect world , but there was much in it richly to enjoy .

		His Father spread a generous table and he could tarry the Lord 's leisure about the board .

		But when he heard that
Agassiz	PERSON	was gone in his '' fresh , joyous , simple '' prime , he thought of him as '' falling without decay and setting without twilight . ''

		And when Sumner a few months later fell , his mood was akin to that of
Huxley	LOCATION	when he said of a friend who had

		THE DIAL 137 '' vanished in the middle of an unfinished art - icle , '' '' after all , that is the way to die , better a thousand times than drivelling off in a fatu - ous old age . ''

		With
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	we might have looked for a long autumn of ripening and golden days , but God saw otherwise .

		The grand frame crumbled before one touch of de - cay had fallen on the splendid intellect , the commanding will , the warm throbbing heart .

		So best .

		The sun went down unquenched .

		In some memories will long linger a tender after - glow .

		The world will go on and seem to for - get
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	.

		His matchless eloquence will be but a tradition .

		His thoughts will pass into the common fund , be but an element in the air that coming generations breathe .

		But his spirit will not die .

		His work will last in a purer earth and a more open and visible Heaven .

		Q A .

		^ R ICH ARDS .

		ORIENTAL , RUGS AND RUG MAKING .

		* From time immemorial the weaving of car - pets and rugs has been the chief manufacturing industry pursued by the peoples inhabiting a large part of southwestern
Asia	LOCATION	.

		The fabrics produced by these peoples have always been highly prized both for their serviceable quality and as works of art .

		Few products of human skill have equalled the best of them in beauty of coloring .

		Choice specimens are eagerly sought after and treasured by collectors ; lovers of them are counted by thousands , for what person of taste is insensible to their charm ?

		Hitherto , accurate information about the different makes and makers has been well-nigh inaccessible .

		The principal source of knowl - edge has been the statements of native dealers , themselves not always well informed , nor free from the proverbial unreliability of their kind .

		Of books upon the subject there have been none save a few costly publications such as
Vincent Robinson	PERSON	's '' Eastern Carpets '' ; and the sumptuous '' Teppicherzeugung im Orient '' issued in
1892	DATE	by the Imperial and Royal Austrian Commercial Museum ,
Vienna	LOCATION	, com - prising five '' elephant '' folio volumes of litho - graphic illustrations of some of the rarest and most beautiful rugs and carpets owned by European collectors and by the Museum .

		Copies of these books are seldom to be found even upon the shelves of the great libraries .

		were intended they have been bought for the most part by mercantile houses who have uti - lized the designs for reproduction in modern fabrics .

		Mr.
John Kimberly Mumford	PERSON	's recent book on '' Oriental Rugs '' finds , therefore , practic - ally a vacant field , and will be welcomed by all who are interested in the topic of which it treats .

		The author has performed his task with intelligence and painstaking thoroughness , and has accomplished the rare feat of writing an entertaining book on a technical subject .

		The history of the art , the rug-weaving peoples , the materials , dyers and dyes , method of weaving , the designs , and the classifications by localities and kinds , are severally dealt with in detail and the essential facts set forth in a manner which is a model of clearness .

		As an example of Mr.
Mumford	PERSON	's style , and for its own sake as a graphic presentation of the picturesqueness of life in the
East	LOCATION	, his remarks about the dyers are worthy of being quoted at some length .

		He says : '' This preeminence in dye-working carries with it , in Oriental countries , a dignity almost akin to that of priesthood .

		As a tree is known by its fruits , the dyer has place among his fellows by his hues .

		In proportion as the color he excels in is valued in popular judgment , the dye-master is honored in his town ; and even if there were a lotion which could obliterate from dress and cuticle the traces of his trade , he would scorn to use it .

		His color is the badge of his ancient and hon - orable calling , dear to him as the insignia of rank to the soldier , or churchly black to the ecclesiastic .

		He glories in being bedaubed , and the shades of his particular color , upon hands , feet , and raiment , are earnest of his skill .

		He is a walking sampler of bis dyes ; the proofs of his proficiency are upon him . ''

		Traversing a village street in the
East	LOCATION	, you are aware of the dyer from afar off .

		Red , green , or purple from head to heels , he challenges sight when he is yet half a mile distant .

		There is the pride of a sultan in his carriage , and in his soul , it is plain , a chromatic joy which religion can not give .

		He is a fine bit of color against the tame background of the town .

		In baggy knee-nethers and white camisole , his head all swaddled in a mighty turban , and his fat leathern pouch for pipe , tobacco , knife , money , and trinkets , belted about his middle , he is a type .

		But add to all these his dye , which in many values of the same color illumines him , from the crown of his turbaned head to the tips of his bare toes , he is a radiant being such as
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	civilization has not known , save upon circus days . ''

		The mind of this worthy is pervaded by a profound and , in a way , justifiable belief that he is the saving clause of the whole carpet industry .

		The mainspring of his life is the conviction that he really lends to the fabrics of his bailiwick , and of his native land , for that matter , all they possess of high aesthetic value .

		In his own view , he is the uplif ter of an otherwise slavish and mechanical craft .

		Through him weaving becomes an art , and all the processes from first to last , are merely 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, incidental to the main affair his coloring of the yarns .

		So he dips and struts his complacent life away , and to be an al boyaji a dyer of reds is to be one beloved of the Prophet . '' ''

		Color , '' as Mr.
Mumford	PERSON	happily phrases it , u is the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	's secret and its glory . ''

		This , if not the whole truth , is at least true of that part of the Orient where the rug-makers live .

		It is a singular fact that retrogression in per - ception of color harmony should be the con - comitant of advancement in the scale of civili - zation .

		Yet the works of primitive peoples are almost without exception distinguished by excellence of coloring ; while among civilized peoples the power of producing color combina - tions of the highest order is one of the rarest of gifts .

		To a considerable extent the superi - ority in this regard of the products of barbaric or semi-civilized peoples is due to simpler and more artistic methods .

		As scientific knowledge increases , these methods are gradually sup - planted by others which lower the cost of pro- duction but also cheapen the product and substitute mechanical effects for the more artistic results of individual handiwork with its freedom of selection and variation .

		Though the mechanism of modern printing presses and looms is indeed marvellous , the most beautiful color-printing the world has yet seen was done by Japanese artizans by simply laying sheets of paper face downward upon engraved blocks inked with a brush , and pressing them by rub - bing with a pad held in the hand ; and some of the loveliest fabrics ever produced were wrought by Oriental weavers upon looms con - sisting of little more than two upright beams , '' mere trunks of trees roughly trimmed , with the shanks of the lopped-off branches left to support the rollers . ''

		The past tense is used advisedly in this connection , for though the rug industry , under the stimulus of foreign orders , flourishes as never before , and the rug - weaving peoples imbued with the inertia of the Orient , continue to live as lived their fore - fathers before them for many generations , nevertheless they have succumbed to the in - roads of modern commercialism and have fallen victims to the seductive cheapness of analine dyes .

		Fortunately , however , there is at least a chance of stemming the tide before it is too late .

		In some of the rug-weaving districts there appears to be a growing appreciation , which it is to be hoped may continue and in - crease , that the adoption of European designs and the use of foreign dyes is a fatal error ; though it must be admitted that so far the at - tempts on the part of the Persian and Turkish governments to repel the invasion have not met with unqualified success .

		Here at least is a real instance of the banal influence of the '' money power . ''

		The illustrations in Mr.
Mumford	PERSON	's book are altogether admirable .

		The only cause for regret is that they could not have been extended to include reproductions of all , or nearly all , of the typical patterns in use , even though it were necessary to resort to a cheaper and less satisfactory process for the additional cuts .

		This would have made the book of greater value to students .

		There are sixteen color plates by the new photochrome process , which reproduce in a really marvelous manner the color , texture , and quality of the old rugs se - lected for illustration .

		Other plates in mono - chrome reproduce typical rug designs , and there are several interesting half-tone plates from photographs taken by the author showing scenes in the rug-making districts .

		LITERATURE IN
INDIANA	LOCATION	.

		*
Indiana	LOCATION	is a
State	ORGANIZATION	about which it is possible to hold very divergent opinions .

		In the matter of general literary standing , it has , among its sister States , certainly no enviable reputation ; within its own borders , the rather resentful attitude toward the foreign opinion emphasizes unduly the importance of what the
State	ORGANIZATION	has actually achieved .

		As might be guessed , neither opinion is exactly right :
Indiana	LOCATION	de - serves more credit than she has been given by outsiders ; and it will be some time before her merits will justify her own present estimate .

		This sort of comment might be made of any State that has literary aspirations ; but because the very fact that
Indiana	LOCATION	has literary aspira - tions seems droll to the outside world , the com - ment or truism is especially in point .

		Nettled by the persistent charge of illiteracy , and hav - ing anyway a real liking for literary things , the Indianian -LRB- Hoosier he calls himself , but does not like others to call him so -RRB- has set himself to the cultivation of literature , and has , despite sneers and sarcasms , accomplished things that are distinctly worth while .

New York	LOCATION	: Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 139 what the
State	ORGANIZATION	has done in print ,
Indiana	LOCATION	has most emphatically no cause to be ashamed .

		She does , indeed , estimate this production far too charitably , but she will arrive at a critical apprehension of her actual literary value , probably , before the scoffers have done with their uncritical scoffing .

		In the mean - time , the two books before us , Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's study of letters in
Indiana	LOCATION	and Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's selections from
Indiana	LOCATION	poets , will do a good deal toward tempering the extreme views re - ferred to .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's book is a self - restrained , conscientious effort to set forth the facts in the case .

		The writer traces the growth of the in - tellectual life within the
State	ORGANIZATION	, from its terri - torial beginnings to the present day ; the varying make-up of its population ; the indi - vidual marks of its most characteristic institu - tions and towns : in short , he soberly essays a chapter in American cultur-geschichte , dealing with the
State	ORGANIZATION	whose life he knows from within .

		The result is an excellent piece of work .

		The chapter on New Harmony -LRB- that most interesting and charming of
Indiana	LOCATION	towns -RRB- , narrating at length the fortunes of a community that from the early Bappite days has always kept its face toward the light , must have more than local interest .

		The brief essays , in part biographical , in part critical , on
Eggleston	LOCATION	,
Wallace	PERSON	,
Riley	PERSON	,
Thompson	PERSON	, and others , send one with an awakened interest to the pages of the other volume under review .

		And yet it must be said of Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's book , that it does not prove its case .

		It shows beyond cavil that things intellectual happen in
Indiana	LOCATION	as well as elsewhere ; but when all is said , it leaves the reader with the feeling that something he did not know much about has been made clear , rather than that here is something new and preeminently worth knowing .

		The second book , the volume of selections , has been well managed by its editors .

		Their aim was to show fairly what
Indiana	LOCATION	has done in poetry in a century .

		No fewer than one hundred and forty-six names are on the list of writers .

		A book of one-tenth as many poets , with ten times as much from each one as is here allowed , would have been a book of far better literary quality , but it would have been correspondingly less representative .

		One turns the pages respectfully .

		Here is no revelation of new poetic power , but many a verse that one is glad to read , and many more that will not attract a second time .

		The best things are already well-known ; the hitherto unknown rarely have the unmistakable note of passion or of charm .

		But if they fail to make the final appeal , they nevertheless are , as a rule , dignified and sincere .

		They show that
Indiana	LOCATION	has an absolute craving to express itself in lit - erary form , and this means that the
State	ORGANIZATION	has encouraged , and will encourage , literature .

		But there is too much rushing into print .

		The craving to express oneself is not the same as the need to express oneself , and this means that much of the
Indiana	LOCATION	poetry is uncon - sciously imitative , and therefore expresses no genuine message .

		That in the three hundred or more poems which make up the volume there should be so comparatively little that is futile speaks highly for the good taste of Mr.
Parker	PERSON	and his associate .


Indiana	LOCATION	's real contribution to literature is Mr.
Riley	PERSON	, a true poet , if I may arrogate the right to judge .

		Of the rest of the choir , one notes here and there a genuinely poetic voice : of the men ,
Maurice Thompson	PERSON	, whose lamented death has been but recently an - nounced ; of the women ,
Miss Evaleen Stein	PERSON	; perhaps half a dozen besides .

		The many others who sing have their reward in singing , and in knowing that they have greatly helped to clear their commonwealth of an oft-repeated charge .

		The '' Hoosier literary zeal '' is an honest im - pulse that no
American State	ORGANIZATION	may live without .


MARTIN W. SAMPSON	PERSON	.

		NOVEL , VIEWS OF NERVOUS FUNCTIONS .

		* Professor
Loeb	PERSON	's manual to which he gives the title , '' Comparative Physiology of the Brain and Comparative Psychology , '' is not at all a compendium devoUed to a survey of accepted facts and principles in regard to the way in which the nervous system performs its func - tions , but is an original contribution to the fundamental conceptions of what a nervous system is and does .

		The work is indeed radical in its tendencies and calls into question certain generally ac - cepted and basal notions .

		An elaborate and ingenious series of experiments upon the lower forms of animal life leads the author to the conclusion that the responses which these or - ganisms make are essentially physico-chemical in their nature ; '' life-phenomena are deter - * COMPARATIVR PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN , and Com - parative Psychology .

		140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, mined by physical and chemical conditions which are outside the realm of histology . ''

		In accordance with this view , the function of the central nervous system is considerably lowered ; instead of the currently accepted conception of a centralizing and coordinating power , it is maintained that '' the central nervous system does not control response to stimulation '' ; '' the assumption of special centres of coordi - nation is superfluous '' ; the nervous system simply acts as a more speedy means of con - ducting the impressions , and the nervous sys - tem consists of a series of segmental reflexes each capable of going through a certain me - chanical activity .

		The essential intellectual function is associative memory , and it is in the complexity and variety of development of this function that comparative psychology finds its problems . ''

		Accordingly we do not raise and discuss the ques - tion as to whether or not animals possess intelligence , but we consider it our aim to work out the dynamics of the processes of association , and find out the physical or chemical conditions which determine the variations in the capacity of memory in the various organisms . ''

		The views thus set forth by Professor
Loeb	PERSON	are far-reaching in their consequences and seem certain to play an important role in biological controversy for the immediate future .

		They particularly antagonize the doc - trines of the localization of functions in the brain , and for the moment seem to favor the position of the uniform value of brain areas , a doctrine in vogue before the `` localizationists '' came forward with their brilliant experiments .

		It may be , however , that a reinterpretation of these experiments , and a bringing into harmony of many puzzling exceptions , may result from the changed mode of approach to these prob - lems advocated by Professor
Loeb	PERSON	.

		In the discussion of the * inheritance of ac - quired characteristics -LRB- and the mechanism of all heredity , according to
Loeb	PERSON	, must be found again in chemical qualities -RRB- we have an ex - ample of how quickly a view that at first sight seems to run counter to current facts and beliefs soon comes into good standing and gathers to its support an astonishing array of apparently unobserved facts .

		Possibly the same fate awaits these well-stated and clearly developed views ; and no student of this most interesting phase of the problems of life can afford to re - main in ignorance of the wide range of facts , and the suggestive series of interpretations which Professor
Loeb	PERSON	has brought together in this volume .

		THE DIAL 141 Among Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's miscellaneous pieces , the verses called '' Iter Supremum '' seem to stand out above the rest by force of their sheer imaginative vision and their grave beauty .

		`` Oh , what a night for a soul to go I The wind a hawk , and the fields in snow ; No screening cover of leaves in the wood , Nor a star abroad the way to show . ''

		Do they part in peace , soul with its clay ?

		Tenant and landlord , what do they say ?

		Was it sigh of sorrow or of release I heard just now as the face turned gray ?

		`` What if , aghast on the shoreless main Of Eternity , it sought again The shelter and rest of the
Isle of Time	ORGANIZATION	, And knocked at the door of its house of pain !

		`` On the tavern hearth the embers glow .

		The laugh is deep and the flagons low , But without , the wind and the trackless sky And night at the gates where a soul would go ! ''

		The sonnets of Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	exhibit a con - siderable degree of mastery over the mechanics of their verse-form , and usually have enough of sub - stantial thought and imagination to make them ac - ceptable .

		The collection entitled '' The Fields of Dawn and Later Sonnets '' includes an even hun - dred pieces , which are characterized by even excel - lence .

		Since there is little choice among them , we select , almost at random , the following : `` There is a legend the Algonqnins tell Of power and splendor of the Great White One ; The God of Light he is , and of the Sun , And in their strange lore hath no parallel .

		He , in the
Summer	DATE	, from his citadel .

		Comes to the gates of his dominion , And throws them open when the day 's begun , And shuts them in the evening .

		But a spell Saps his puissance when the
Autumn	DATE	haze Spreads its dim-shimmering silver on the rills ; Then to the mountain-tops he slowly wends And , idly drowsing on the dreamy hills , Puffs at his pipe , and as the smoke descends .

		Behold our mellow Indian Summer days ! ''

		The sequence of nearly fifty sonnets from which this is taken sings very effectively of the procession of the seasons in
Southern Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, as reflected in the youthful consciousness of the poet during a single year .

		The modest collection of verses written during the past ten or twelve years by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	shows that the more tender and fan - ciful sides of a man 's nature need undergo no atrophy from the most strenuous pursuit of severe intellectual ideals .

		These verses reveal an aspect of their author that may be strange to those who think of him in his public character who think of him as the energetic educational administrator , the strong toiler in the difficult fields of science , the uncompromising upholder of the principles of political morality but they are no surprise to his friends , and it is to his friends that they are ad - dressed .

		The opening lines '' To Barbara '' are too intimate for discussion , and in view of the writer 's recent bereavement , too sacred for anything more explicit than this veiled comment .

		Let us quote rather from the graceful song of '' Vive ` rols . '' ''

		Beyond the sea , I know not where , There is a town called Vive ` rols ; I know not if ' t is near or far , I know not what its features are , I only know ' t is Vive ` rols .

		`` I only know , should thou and I Through its old walls of crumbling stone Together wander all alone , No spot on earth conld be more fair Than ivy-covered Vive ` rols !

		No grass be greener anywhere , No blner sky nor softer air Than we should find in Vive ` rols .

		`` Love , we may wander far or near , The sun shines bright o'er Vive ` rols ; Green is the grass , the skies are clear .

		No clouds obscure our pathway , dear ; Where love is , there is Vive ` rola , There is no other Vive ` rols . ''

		Thus Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	strikes the note of sentiment ; but a deeper note is struck when his mind contem - plates the grave problems of man 's destiny .

		`` When man shall come to manhood 's destiny , When our slow-toddling race shall be full grown , Deep in each human heart a chamber lone Of Holies Holiest shall builded be ; And each man for himself shall hold the key .

		Each there must kindle his own altar fires , Each burn an offering of his own desires , And each at last his own High Priest must be . ''

		Here is the expression of a faith that can contem - plate undismayed the breaking down of beliefs that have had their day , and can find a firm refuge in ideals far nobler than were ever revealed to souls in the bondage of superstition .

		Another little book of verse from the far West the work of one of Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's associates is taken up with the same deep matters , but reveals a mind still restless from the onslaughts of science upon superstition , and uncertain concerning the ultimate goodness of the soul of things .

		`` Says Science : ' Lo , I lift the veil .

		Behold ! '

		But when we turn , with eyes that almost fail , Before the Face in darkness from of old Shrouded , there hangs a yet unlif ted veil . ''

		Thus discourses Mr.
William Henry Hudson	PERSON	in '' The Sphinx and Other Poems . ''

		He has no clear vision of what may be beyond that other unlifted veil .

		But what the intelligence fails to discern seems sometimes to be foreshadowed in dreams .

		`` Was it a dream ?

		I know not .

		This I know The memory of that evening long ago , Though oftentimes I yet have sought in vain To catch that wind-borne melody again , Has linger 'd in my life , a sacred part Of all my deepest being ; for to me .

		With some strange hint of some strange mystery , That murmur brought a solace for the heart , An inward sense that everything was well , A touch of peace , of which no words can tell ! ''

		But the old doubt recurs , and the waking hour dis - credits the vision seen in sleep .

		The author 's mood is that of the '' Pathetic '' symphony of
Tschai	LOCATION	- 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, kowsky ; it is the mood of Arnold rather than that of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Let us once more contrast it with that of Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	, as expressed in '' The Bubbles of
Saki	PERSON	. '' ''

		I do rejoice that when ' of me and thee ' Men talk no longer , yet not less but more The Eternal
Saki	PERSON	still that bowl shall fill , And ever stronger , fairer bubbles pour . ''

		A humble note in the Eternal Song , The Perfect Singer hath made place for me , And not one atom in
Earth	LOCATION	's wondrous throng But shall be needful to
Infinity	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This is the effective major resolution of the minor harmonies of the other poet .

		Mr.
Charles Keeler	PERSON	's '' Idyls of El Dorado '' are Californian lays and legends , picturesque in their portrayal of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast in its physical aspects , and reflecting the free expansive spirit of its in - habitants .

		As a bit of local coloring , these Mon - terey stanzas are effective : '' The sea throbs faintly at my feet , Amid the rocks it swashes low , In pale green sweeps And purple deeps It undulates with tireless beat , It pulses in unending flow . ''

		All green and brown the seaweed clings To pallid rocks , wave-worn and grim ; The mountains rise To misty skies , The wind amid the cypress sings And sea-birds wander dark and dim . ''

		But the writer is not content with the natural beauty of the land which is his home , and his vision foresees the added beauty of art in some future day .

		`` Beauty shall here hold court upon the heights And men shall fashion temples for her shrine , With chantings high of praise and starward flights Of silver chords and organ 's throb divine .

		`` The sculptor here shall hew the formless stone To shapes of beauty dreamed on cloud-throned crest , The painter shall reveal what he alone Saw as he brooded on th ' earth-mother 's breast . ''

		All this may well be .

		Meanwhile , we note with more satisfaction than all this prophecy the fact that the writer 's voice is raised in indignant protest against the madness , springing from the lust of foreign conquest , that has of late made a mock of all our political ideals , and that has infected the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	more fatally than any other section of the country .

		It is from
Alaska	LOCATION	that a text is taken for the following fine stanza : '' We who have failed to rule a wilderness Now preach of liberty in tropic seas ; Forsooth our sway the Orient hordes shall bless While politicians trim to every breeze , Ood , must our dear sons be slain , such men to please ? ''

		Still another Californian volume is Mr.
Howard V. Sutherland	PERSON	's ''
Jacinta	PERSON	. ''

		It is a very small volume , and the narrative poem which serves it for a title makes up the greater part of the contents .

		A simplicity and a sentimentality that seem to be alike affected are the characteristics of this versified tale .

		Instead of quoting from it , we prefer to select one of Mr.
Sutherland	PERSON	's miscellaneous pieces , and it shall be this '' Prayer for a Man 's Passing . '' ''

		Let me not pass till eve , Till that day 's fight is done ; What soldier cares to leave The field until it 's won !

		And I have loved my work and fain Would be deemed worthy of the ranks again . ''

		Let twilight come ,
then night	TIME	, And when the first birds sing Their matin songs , and light Wakens each slumbering thing , Let Someone waken me , and set My feet to steps that lead me upward yet . ''

		Mr.
Frederic Crowninshield	PERSON	has written a cen - tury of sonnets , and appended to them a few short pieces in other lyrical forms , all for the purpose of illustrating the thesis that painters have emotions peculiar to their own special art , and that they alone can give them adequate verbal expression . ''

		Pictoris Carmina '' is the title of this volume of verse , which does not mean that all of its contents are poems for pictures , although a series of eight illustrations to some extent bear out this suggestion .

		These poems exhibit refinement and the culture that comes from wide reading and journeying ; they also display considerable technical ability .

		That they are far from faultless in this respect may be illustrated by such a line as the second of these two : '' We of the East , who you but y ester bore , Were aliens , and variations racial show . ''

		Another illustration is this opening of the sonnet u To Science '' : '' In the world 's race , Science , you sore strain Our credence with the miracles that bring Great gain perchance not bliss . ''

		Mr.
Crowninshield	PERSON	's diction is not essentially poet - ical , and it is the thinker rather than the singer whose voice speaks from these pages .

		There are too many words not yet mellowed to poetic uses , too many startling and cacophonous collocations , and the poet 's hand is clearly not subdued to the material in which it works .

		Yet there are frequent phrases that arrest the attention by their vivid presentation of truth , and a certain not easily de - finable pleasure may be derived from these stiff - jointed measures .

		To exhibit the writer at his best , we will select the sonnet called '' Decadence . '' ''

		When fields are green with aftermath of Fall , When trees parade in rich vermillioned dress , Wan exhalations from the vales possess The full , ripe forms of
Earth	LOCATION	, and cast a pall Impalliding o'er mellowed hues .

		Withal Not charmless but the charm that doth impress Pale fever on some deep-eyed shepherdess Near
Rome	LOCATION	, who croons her morbid madrigal .

		Yet when the waxing sun with lusty rays
Burns	PERSON	into nothingness the vapors white , And bares the splendid view of mount and lea , Then gladsome Nature chants his ringing praise .

		0 , Life , consume the pale malarious blight That hangs o'er Art , and give us Sanity ! '' ''

		Withal not charmless '' this is the final verdict upon Mr.
Crowninshield	PERSON	's labored but interesting
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 The poems of Mr.
Samuel Valentine Cole	PERSON	open with a group of pieces inspired by classical asso - ciations , with a tribute to
Lucretius	PERSON	, whose '' Voice goes singing through the world , And in it the troth-seeking soul of man , '' a tribute to
Virgil	PERSON	, who '' In the interval between
Great Homer	ORGANIZATION	and the glorious Florentine , Builded his dream of mingled fate and faith .

		Now swaying toward the dreary pagan doubt , Now , by prophetic vision a mere chance , Toward the dear Hope so soon to light the world . ''

		These poems suggest the Tennysonian manner , and suggestion becomes somewhat too obviously imita - tion in the poems that follow .

		In The Song of Silenus , '' for example , we read that `` So he sang till on the water melted evening 's golden bar , Till the fire died on the hilltops , sang until the evening star , Till we saw the silent
Archer	PERSON	climb his zenith-winding stair , And across the northern heavens stream the dark
Egypt	LOCATION	- ian 's hair . ''

		And in '' The Bees of Aristaeus '' we find such evi - dent Locksleyisms as these : '' Summers of the stormlesa heaven , summers of the windless sea , Linked together by as little of the winter as could be ; `` Fountains singing in the covert or asleep like liquid glass , And no poison in the flowers , and no serpent in the grass ; ''
Meads	PERSON	of unlaborious tillage , seas without the toiling oars ; Magic ships of cloud and sunshine dropped all treasures on all shores ; '' And no iron-handed terror smiting at the hearts of men ; Justice blindfold ruled the people , War lay chained within his den . ''

		Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's verse discourses of many themes , bat the Tennysonian strain is ever recurrent , and the classical interest reappears on almost every other page .

		The verse is always pleasing , smooth-flowing in its movement , and kindled with the fire of the idealism that never becomes outworn .

		The '' Poems '' of Mr.
Alexander Blair	PERSON	Thaw are admirable in technique and sincere in feeling .

		They are abstract rather than picturesque , and their imaginative quality is of the conventional sort .

		This sonnet to the Venus of Melos is a characteristic example : '' We dare not hope to reach thy lofty place , Nor with dark Fate to be quite reconciled .

		Thy seeming sightless eyes , benignly mild As of the early gods , or of some race Of men almost divine , look into space Beyond our mortal vision ; with no wild Swift passion torn , so hast thon ever smiled Great love immortal lighting thy calm face . ''

		Born of the womb of earth , who doth beguile Both gods and man to woo her , for all time Thou art a thing of worship .

		Ah , sublime Mother of men !

		We may not reconcile The darkness with the dreaming ; yet still we climb The starlit heights to win thy sacred smile . ''

		The author of '' The Lute and Lays , '' in the opening poem of his volume , thus discourses of the themes he has sought to set to music : '' I sing of beauty as the birds Awake in gladness and rejoice That God hath given each a voice To sing their joy , though not in words . ' '

		I sing a heart-felt happiness The glad contentment of the soul When joy breaks forth beyond control And utters more than words express . ''

		How shall I then my gladness hide , As down the drift of life I roam ?

		All nature is my boundless home , And love my only perfect guide . ''

		For in love 's light my song takes wing ; Her star pervades my universe , And all my rhapsodies are hers It is her beauty that I sing . ''

		Mr.
Welles	PERSON	fills something like a hundred pages with pleasant little verses of this simple type .

		They are full of tender sentiment , but exhibit little variety , and call for no detailed comment .

		The `` Lyrical Vignettes '' of Mr.
F. V. N. Fainter	PERSON	are simple studies in verse , no one of them overrunning a single page , and indicative of a very modest ambition . ' '

		I would with
Wordsworth	PERSON	sing in humble lays , But true in every tone , The simple joys and woes that fill our days With merriment or moan . ''

		This is the sort of thing that Mr.
Painter	PERSON	gives as , commendable in sentiment and commonplace in expression .

		More than once , in his volume entitled '' On Life 's Stairway , '' Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	exhorts his fellow-poets to rise to the height of their great calling .

		`` Unravel all your tangled cheats .

		Your triple-twisted thread conceits , Your subtle sonnets fling afar !

		Stand up and show what man you are !

		`` O juggler with the fire divine , O hoarder of God 's bread and wine , Your dark and doleful sprigs of verse Nod like the plumes above a hearse . ''

		We want again the note of joy , The immortal rapture of the boy , The flame lit quenchless in the dust , The lips that sing because they must . ''

		But in spite of such brave words as these , Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	has contented himself with the '' sprigs of verse , '' very pretty sprigs sometimes , as in his '' Secrets . ''

		`` O Rose , climb up to her window And in through the casement reach , And say what I may not utter , In your beautiful silent speech !

		`` She will shake the dew from your petals , She will press you close to her lips , She will hold you never so lightly In her warm white finger-tips . ''

		And then who can tell ?

		She may whisper -LRB- While the city dreams below -RRB- , ' I was dreaming of him when you woke me , But , rose , he must never know . ' ''

		Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	is one of the most promising of our younger group of poets , but 144 THE DIAL , we can not say that her second volume quite renews for us the pleasure given by '' The Wayfarers . ''

		The new collection includes one long piece an Elizabethan play and a number of essentially lyrical compositions .

		Of the play , in which
W. S.	ORGANIZATION	himself has a part , we must say that it is ingenious but not convincing .

		The other pieces suffer from too much of what may be called pale abstraction .

		They are best when they are most simple , as in these stanzas : `` Now the roads , hushed with dark , Lead the homeward way , I will rest , I will hark What the weeds can say ; Wondering in the afterglow , Heart 's - ease of the day .

		`` One day more , one day more .

		Ay , if it were new !

		There the city smoke goes soft , Melting in the blue ; And the highways , vext with dust , Heal them in the dew . ''

		Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	's '' Afterglow , '' in which her later poems have been collected , is serene with the soft radiance of the just accomplished twilight .

		The writer has been a graceful and melodious singer through all her years , and her song is still sweet and sincere .

		We may quote the following sonnet as expressive of the spirit that breathes through these chastened pages . ''

		Whom the Gods love die old !

		Oh life , dear life , Let the old sing thy praises , for they know How year by year the summers come and go , Each with its own abounding sweetness rife !

		They know , though frosts be cruel as the knife , Yet with each
June	DATE	the perfect rose shall blow , And daisies blossom and the green grass row , Triumphant still , unvexecl by storm or strife .

		They know that night more splendid is than day ; That sunset skies flame in the gathering dark , And the deep waters change to molten gold ; They know that
Autumn	LOCATION	richer is than
May	DATE	; They hear the night-birds singing like the lark Ah life , sweet life , whom the Gods love die old 1 '' The `` Last Songs from Vagabondia '' form the third booklet in the series which embodies the joint activity of Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	and the late
Richard Hovey	PERSON	.

		The poems are credited to their respective writers , but this precaution is hardly necessary with two men whose lyrical styles are so widely diverse .

		There are few pieces in the book which a careful critic could not certainly assign to its proper authorship without the warrant of any formal indication .


Richard Hovey	PERSON	's sonnet '' From the Cliff '' may be taken as a characteristic example of his work . ''

		Here on this ledge , the broad plain stretched below , The calm hills smiling in immortal mirth , The blue sky whitening as it nears the earth ,
Afar	LOCATION	where all the summits are aglow , I feel a mighty wind upon me blow Like God 's breath kindling in my soul a birth Of turbulent music struggling to break girth , I pass with
Dante	ORGANIZATION	through eternal woe , Quiver with
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's passion at my heart ,
See Pindar	ORGANIZATION	's chariots flashing past the goal , Triumph o'er splendours of unutterable light And know supremely this , O God , Thou art , Feeling in all this tumult of my soul Grand kinship with the glory of Thy might . ''

		One could not find a better description of
Richard Hovey	PERSON	's talent than the very phrase which speak a of '' turbulent music struggling to break girth . ''

		His verse always seems to chafe against the limita - tions of form , and he recks little for such minor verbal infelicities as the use of '' grand '' in the closing line .

		On the other hand , the more surely artistic instinct of Mr.
Carman	PERSON	makes the author - ship of such a piece as '' Marigolds '' absolutely un - mistakable .

		`` The marigolds are nodding ; I wonder what they know .

		Go .

		listen very gently ; You may persuade them so .

		`` Go , be their little brother As humble as the grass , And lean upon the hill - wind .

		And watch the shadows pass .

		`` Put off the pride of knowledge , Put by the fear of pain ; You may be counted worthy To live with them again .

		`` Be Darwin in your patience , Be Chaucer in your love ; They may relent and tell you What they are thinking of . ''

		Even when the note becomes grotesque or didactic , departing widely from the ordinary lyrical gamut , the distinctive qualities of the two poets are none the less apparent .

		He would be a dull observer who would not be sure to whom to attribute '' The Sceptics . '' ''

		It was the little leaves beside the road . ''

		Said Grass , ' What is that sound So dismally profound , That detonates and desolates the air ? ' '

		That is St.
Peter	PERSON	's bell , ' Said rain-wise Pimpirnel ; ' He is music to the godly , Though to us he sounds so oddly , And he terrifies the faithful unto prayer . '

		`` Then something very like a groan Escaped the naughty little leaves .

		`` Said Grass , ` And whither track These creatures all in black , So woebegone and penitent and meek ? ' '

		They 're mortals bound for church , ' Said the little Silver
Birch	PERSON	; ' They hope to get to heaven And have their sins forgiven , If they talk to God about it once a week . ' ''

		And something very like a smile Ran through the naughty little leaves .

		`` Said Grass , 4 What is that noise That startles and destroys Our blessed
summer	DATE	brooding when we 're tired ? ' '

		That 's folk a-praising God , ' Said the tough old cynic Clod ; ' They do it every
Sunday	DATE	, They '11 be all right on
Monday	DATE	; It 's just a little habit they 've acquired . ' ''

		And laughter spread among the little leaves . ''

		THE DIAL .

		145 And the reader would be no less doll who should hesitate for a moment abont the proper ascription of the following sonnet . ''

		Our Gothic minds have gargoyle fancies .

		Odd , That there will come a day when yon and 1 Shall not be yon and I , that we shall lie We two , in the damp earth-mould , above each clod A drunken headstone in the neglected sod .

		Thereon the phrase ,
Hie Jacet	LOCATION	, worn awry And then our virtues , bah !

		and piety , Perhaps some cheeky reference to God -LSB- !

		And haply after many a century , Some spectacled old man shall drive the birds A moment from their song in the lonely spot And make a copy of the quaint old words They will then be quaint and old and all for what ?

		To fill a gap in a genealogy . ''

		Mr.
John Stuart Thomson	PERSON	belongs to the group of young Canadian singers who have contributed so largely to American literature during the past score of years , and who have helped to bring into our poetry that penetrative interpretation of natural beauty which is one of the most marked character - istics of American song .

		Reviewing an earlier volume by Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	, we said : '' It is remark - able how close to the heart of nature these young Canadian poets contrive to keep .

		They have the faculty of observation minute , accurate , and at the same time sympathetic in a degree quite ex - traordinary even to-day , and almost unknown in English poetry before
Tennyson	PERSON	opened our eyes . ''

		Recalling this half-forgotten comment , we wish to supplement it by noting in '' A Day 's Song , '' Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's new volume , something of the quality of rich sensuousness of which
Keats	PERSON	had so imperial a mastery .

		Our warrant for this saying shall be an extract from the ode which Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	, greatly daring , has dedicated to Autumn . '' ''

		Now dreams fall in the valleys of the
night	TIME	; The last red poppy stills its ardent breast ; No more the
morning	TIME	, with a hand of light , Will wake its petals from their dreamy rest ; Sighs from each breeze the sad , sweet slumber song ; Sleep , like the dew , falls from the
Evening	ORGANIZATION	's wings , And every Beauty veils its eyes in tears ; What woes to thee belong , Most mournful time , that not a robin sings , To melt thy heart shut up in friendless fears . ''

		Departing glory leaves the world forlorn ; E'en as the moon , above the Delian shrine Forsaken , through these barren fields of corn A pallid light , a sorrow half divine , Falls on the silent moody wilderness ; No harvest bells , laughter of lovers young .

		No music of the ringing scythe , is heard ; Almost a god 's distress Hangs o'er these valleys , where of eld was sung The fluted joyance of a
summer	DATE	's bird . ''

		The glorious poem from which these two stanzas are taken would adorn the coronal of a singer of high renown ; it offers renewed evidence of the truth expressed by him who wrote , '' The poetry of earth is never dead . ''

		We read `` My New Curate , '' by the Rev.
P. A. Sheehan	PERSON	, a few months ago with so much quiet satisfaction that the name of the writer became at once a passport to favorable consideration for whatever else he might publish , and when a volume of verse of the same authorship appeared not long since , we anticipated from its reading a genuine pleasure .

		That anticipation has not been disap - pointed , for '' Cithara Mea '' is a collection of pieces that stir the deepest emotions , and appeal to the most spiritual part of our being .

		Technically , they are very faulty , but they contain so much of the substance of true poetry , that we may well pardon the occasional redundancies and cacophonies .

		As befits the writer 's calling , these poems are mainly religious in their inspiration , and the note is boldly sounded in '' The Hidden '' and '' The Revealed , '' the two pieces which open the volume .

		Those moods of rapture and mystical exaltation which are the very essence of religion are not often imparted to readers as this verse succeeds in imparting them , and the spirituality of the utterance is no more striking than ia the imaginative splendor of the diction when at its best . ''

		God 's vesture curves and floats around His throne , As float ensanguined clouds at eventide ; His Heaven is thickly peopled ; yet alone In their majestic solitude abide '' The Holy Ones .

		No angel wing hath swept The golden dust of all the centuries , Or tears the lonely JEons have bewept , And sunk into the silence of eternities , '' There where His footstool stretches thro ' the cloud ; Yet , the vast silences of God are stirred By all the pauseless waves that cry aloud In anthems that afar are feebly heard , '' Although the orbed heaven reels and quakes Under the thunders that are ever rolled From shrill-voiced spirits o'er the quivering lakes Of spaces populous , or of worlds nnsonled . ''

		More than once , in reading these companion poems of doubt and faith in alternation , we have been re - minded of the great central poem of the century upon this subject the supreme expression of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		Father
Sheehan	PERSON	's blank verse is sometimes very fine indeed , as in his story of '' Sentan the Culdee , '' the monk who dallied with the imaginings of heathen philosophers until his faith was on the point of losing its moorings .

		He is ordered , for the saving of his soul , to become a hermit , and these are the words of the Abbot who pronounces the decree of exile : 41 Thy bed the heather , salted by sea - winds ; Thy books the open manuscripts of God ; Thy food whate'er the sea - fowl bring to thee .

		Once and again , thou mayst near approach The cells , where dwell the brethren of Ardmor , To shrive thee , and receive the Paschal guest .

		But thou shalt shun all intercourse with men , And love the silent solitudes of God .

		Perchance in some far off and distant time , When thou , through fires of discipline and prayer , The dim mists cleansed from thy half-blinded eyes ,
Hast	LOCATION	, in the sacred silence of the seas , Pondered the dread exorbitance of God : Thou mayest go forth to see the blinding face Of Him , to whom the stars are blackened slags .

		And angels ' faces blurred and stained with sin . ''

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Such verse as this is rare enough in our modern time , as rare , perhaps , as the lost faith bemoaned by the poet , when he sings of '' These leaden days , from which the sun Of God 's sweet Face hath vanished into night , And in the depths His voice hath died away . ''

		Although religious inspiration gives the breath of life to Father
Sheehan	PERSON	's volume , there are occasional pieces of lighter strain , such , for example , as the lyric '' Cosette , '' with its pathetic invocation to the spirit of a lost child : '' Across the gray sands of
Dinan	LOCATION	, Cosette !

		Contest thou , bird of sea and song , Cosette !

		Thy hair-cloud streaming far behind , Vexed by the teasing , amorous wind , Light in thy laughing eyes , and kind , Cosette I '' Finally , to do anything like adequate justice to this volume , we must reproduce this noble sonnet upon the '' Mer-de-Glace . '' ''

		Hither God brought His rebel seas to try How high His wrath could lash them , unrelieved By sinking spaces or by lowering sky But they , by loftiest altitudes deceived , Leaped to his lash as if they fain believed They too could sweep the skies , and there decry His mandate when the smoking altars heaved And sullen waters left the hill-tops dry . ''

		But He , resenting such Titanic pride , Transfixed them in columnar ice and stone , Leaving vast valleys in their solitude .

		There till the scythes of the last lava-tide Shall level all things , all proud things dethrone .

		The spirits of those
Stylites	PERSON	dream and brood . ''

		Here is splendor of imagination and to spare .

		There is not a poet living who might not be proud to have written this sonnet .

		It is not often that one thin volume displays the versatility of Mr.
C. K. Pooler	PERSON	's '' Translations and Other Verses . ''

		Taking the contents in order , we find -LRB- 1 -RRB- some graceful translations from the Latin , ranging all the way from Catullus to Landor , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a section of pieces , mostly lyrical , in conventional forms , -LRB- 3 -RRB- a few ballads in Ulster dialect , combining humor with pathos , and both genuine , -LRB- 4 -RRB- some excellent fooling in the form of parodies on
Brown	PERSON	- ing , Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Burton	PERSON	-LRB- of the '' Anatomy '' -RRB- , and
Bacon	PERSON	-LRB- of the `` Essays '' -RRB- , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- an appendix of neatly-turned Latin verses .

		Three of these sections we leave to be read by title , reserving our quotation space for a specimen each of the lyric and the parody .

		Our lyric shall be '' The Evening
Campion	PERSON	. '' ''

		Thy form will lure no maiden 's eye , White flower that flowerest free , Nor here will flaunt the butterfly , Nor hither stoop the bee , And faintest airs of the blue sky Unsweetened float by thee . ''

		Yet lips unknown to morning 's light Drink here beneath the moon ; Scarce mark our eyes the glimmering flight , Scarce heed our ears the tune Of softer winglets of the night Than any wings of noon . ''

		And our parody shall be an excerpt from ''
Saturnia Regna	PERSON	, '' after whom we need not specify . ''

		But too long hath the gold of the merchant been locked from the heart of greed , Too long hath the harvest whitened for the hand that gave the seed ; Too long is the palace mosaic and its light of starry lamps Blind to the Cadger and dumb to the honest shuffle of Tramps , And the harp of the Singer of Sigurd wreathed green with the bay-leaves ' due To ' After the Ball , ' and ' Daisy , ' and ' Linger Longer Loo , ' But O , for the Sun that we see not , and the Moon whereof none knows , Save the Year of the Flowering Yule-tide , and the Field of the Thornless Rose , Where the Pen shall be as the Shovel , and the
Night	ORGANIZATION	shall be as the Day , And the Greed of the Heart shall perish and its Longing pass away ; Where the lute shall be dumb and the viol , and dumb in the happy years The music cradled of sorrow , the song that blossoms for tears .

		Thither when comes the Spoiler , what need of a Battle Call , Where each hath less than a little , and little , belike , have all ?

		Should he tarry for nought who hath nothing ?

		Nay , hard over holt and heath He will hie as the Dog to his kennel with all that is his in his teeth .

		So all that is ours shall be all men 's the heart and the hand and the brain , When over the ghost of a nation shall the risen Balder reign . ''

		This is fooling , no doubt , but it is more than that , and we are glad that the socialist is met with his own weapons , and shown how effective they may prove in hostile hands .

		In a volume of two hundred pages , including ninety illustrations , he contrives to tell with surprising fullness the history of the leading alphabets of the world .

		If any justification of the book were needed , Mr.
Clodd	PERSON	's , as given in his preface , would suffice : that it fills a gap in discussing with comparative fullness '' those primitive stages of the art of writing , knowledge of which is essential for tracing the development of the art , so that its place in the general evolution of human inventions is made clear '' ; and in stating the evidence furnished by the discoveries of Professor

		His able summary of
Evans	ORGANIZATION	's `` Cretan Pictographs and Pre-Phoanician Script '' is one of the most interesting parts of the book .

		He draws no conclusion , but declines to accept M. de Rough 's theory , which
Taylor	ORGANIZATION	supports , that the Pboanician letters came from the Egyptian hieratic writing , preferring to look for a future confirma - tion of
Evans	ORGANIZATION	's theory that `` the rudiments of the Phoenician writing may after all have come in part at least from the ^ gean side . ''

		He differs further from
Taylor	PERSON	in regard to the Indo-Bactrian alpha - bet of the Asoka edicts , with
Burnell	PERSON	considering it as of Iranian origin , whereas
Taylor	PERSON	regards it as coming from the
Sabean	PERSON	; and he does not ac - cept
Taylor	PERSON	's theory of the Greek origin of the runes , leaving the problem unsettled .

Royal Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, a British officer of Napoleonic times , which writings are now at last issued , under the title of '' Under England 's Flag '' -LRB-

		Captain
Boothby	PERSON	was a gal - lant soldier , and a pious , cheery soul withal , who saw much picturesque adventure and some hard fighting under Sir

Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		The closing chapters of the volume narrate Captain
Boothby	PERSON	's experiences in the Peninsular campaigns , and in - clude an account of the
Battle of Corunna	ORGANIZATION	.

		The style of the book , notably of the many letters it contains , is lively and graphic , and one gets from it an impression of a rarely pure and engaging character .

		Some of the Spanish and Portuguese adventures remind one not a little of Borrow though we do not mean to charge the Captain , who is clearly the soul of truth , with honest
Lavengro	PERSON	's addiction to the long bow .

		1872 -LRB-
Hindley	ORGANIZATION	's edition -RRB- , and
1900	DATE	, in Mr.
R. W. Rail	PERSON	's neat little volume entitled `` A Royal Rhetorician '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- .

		To be sure , the '' Counterblaste , '' while of no great literary value , is not bad entertainment for an hour 's smoke ; it is certainly one of the most readable of the king 's works .

		With it Mr.
Rait	PERSON	has printed '' Ane Schort Treatise on Scottis Poesie '' and extracts from '' Essay es of a Prentise '' and '' The Psalms of David Translated . ''

		The texts are those of the first editions somewhat modernized , qu being re - placed by w , and y being used where Mr.
Arber	PERSON	printed z , which , whatever its history , can not now stand for the sound of z. On page 12 , line 11 , read abow ; line 3 , f .

		Difficult woids are en - closed in brackets an improvement in convenience on the ordinary glossary .

		Prefixed is an interesting study of the writings of
King James	ORGANIZATION	, in which Mr.
Rait	PERSON	does full justice to his author without losing sight of the mediocrity which marked this royal scribbler ; and appended is a list of the king 's chief writings .

		The volume is embellished with a portrait of the ; king , and with facsimiles of the title-page of Bishop
Montague	PERSON	's edition of
1616	DATE	and of the Psalms translation published in
1636	DATE	.

		Sixth in the '' Semitic Series '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the Rev.
A. H. Sayce	PERSON	, professor of Assyriology at
Oxford	LOCATION	, puts forth '' Babylonians and Assyrians , '' a title borne by no less than four volumes of the thirteen announced .

		Mr.
Sayce	PERSON	has made an interesting book , though he has not been able to escape the flavor of the class-room , and he moves slowly amid a mass of material that would have been illumina - ting if it could have been realized .

		Among the important disclosures of the narrative is the knowl - edge given of the great money lending and banking firm of
Egibi	LOCATION	, founded somewhat before the day of
Sennacherib	ORGANIZATION	, and extending its history down through the period of the Persian conquest .

		This institu - tion was as dominant a factor in this ancient and almost forgotten world as the Rothschilds are in the world to-day , its records constituting a most valuable discovery .

		It would appear that in this most important branch of commerce , the finance of the twentieth century after
Christ	ORGANIZATION	is no great advance upon that of the ninth century before Christ , just as the wars of conquest of the two periods show '' practical '' Christianity to be little more effective in international morals than the worship of
Sennacherib	ORGANIZATION	's particular
Lord of Hosts	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no index an unpardonable omission .

		A handy , lucid The ninth volume of the `` Epochs bonk on the of Church History '' series is Mr.
Williston Walker	PERSON	's work on `` The Reformation '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The purpose of the series , in presenting church history , is apparently secured by an omission of purely political relations , THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, and an expansion of theological and doctrinal ques - tions .

		There is nothing new in the book , either in matter , treatment , or arrangement ; it is merely a restatement of the essential facts of the period .

		Nevertheless , the author 's work is not without merit , for his style is lucid and his presentation interesting .

		It was of course impossible , in the limited space at his disposal , for Mr.
Walker	PERSON	to cover every detail of the Reformation , yet he has succeeded in con - veying a very fair impression of the intellectual and religious side of the movement .

		This has been done for all European countries save
England	LOCATION	, for which a separate volume in the series is reserved .

		There is a noticeable impartiality of treatment in the inevitable comparison between the principal re - forming leaders , though the author falls in line with modern church writers in ascribing to Me - lancthon a liberality and efficiency not commonly attributed to him by political and socialistic students .

		These latter more frequently find his actions not in harmony with the elevated and non-partisan character of his writings , and criticize him for very apparent inconsistencies .

		Mr.
Walker	PERSON	's book is very readable , and will be of service for handy reference .

		An interesting Doubtless the horrors of the Chinese account of capital during the recent murderous the siege of Pekmg .

		p ro t e st against European aggression are not likely to divest even the most pronounced Christians present of the old Adam that is in them .

		Still , it is difficult to see why the Reverend
William Alexander Parsons Martin	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , lately president of the
Chinese Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	and a mandarin of the second class , should have clad himself in heavy marching order , repeating rifle and all , and posed before an American camera for the frontispiece to `` The Siege of Peking '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , announced by the publishers as '' the first to tell the story , '' and the outbreak it describes as `` the most unique event in history . ''

		Dr.
Martin	PERSON	says the siege was the act of the imperial government of
China	LOCATION	itself , and he breathes the threats against the Chinese , innocent and guilty alike , which have made us wonder recently if Islam and
Christendom	LOCATION	are not exchanging their places in respect of the manner of tenets and propaganda .

		There is nothing in Dr.
Martin	PERSON	's work to show what has been done by the Christian Powers to provoke the attack , though he admits it was not '' wholly unjustifiable . ''

		His account is a mixture of the old '' Trust in God and keep your powder dry , '' which has proved so efficacious upon other occasions in the history of the American people , and is interesting , even though it does not make the most of its opportunities to describe the horrors of the siege .

		A '' Complete Hand-Book of
Havana	LOCATION	*
Cuba	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been prepared by Mr.
Albert J. Norton	PERSON	, who made a tour through the island last year .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	is a firm believer in ''
Cuba Libre	LOCATION	, '' to which his book is dedicated , and his The art of translating .

		really valuable work , filled with illustrations and maps as it is , is noteworthy among its kind for the sympathy it shows for the natives .

		There is no attempt at literary expression in the book , but its plain , matter-of-fact manner is more praiseworthy than much fine writing and false patriotism .

		The hand-book fills a need , and will be useful and valuable to all who would know something of the island that has played so prominent a part in the world 's history , and has changed so vastly American policy and traditions .

		Teachers and translators of foreign languages will find in Professor
Herbert C. Tolman	PERSON	's little book on '' The Art of Translating '' -LRB-
B. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- much sound doctrine and helpful suggestion agreeably presented .

		It is plainly inspired by Cauer 's '' Die
Kunst des Uebersetzens	PERSON	, '' a practical little manual designed for the use of teachers of the classics , which we would like to see translated into English , Professor
Tolman	PERSON	's work being in no sense a translation or an adaptation of it .

		Professor
Tolman	PERSON	also acknowledges his debt to Professor
W. G. Hale	PERSON	, to whom , he justly adds , '' more than to any other American scholar we owe the practical method of reading Latin now so generally adopted . ''

		Professor
Tolman	PERSON	's eighty odd pages are replete with the marks of ripe scholarship , and reflection bred of practical experience , and they are so brightened with epigram and extract that the reader is lured on pleasantly from chapter to chapter for - getful of the didactive purpose of the author .

		Pieturetof There is nothing pleasanter in its
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's kind that we know of than a leis - country .

		urely jaunt through leafy
Warwick	PERSON	- shire , rich in shrines and scenic allurements , and as a good pictorial substitute , or preparative , for such a jaunt we take pleasure in calling attention to
John Leyland	PERSON	's copiously illustrated thin octavo volume entitled '' The Shakespeare Country '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	' Importation -RRB- .

		The work is essentially a picture-book , though the plates are accompanied by the indispensable quota of descriptive text .

		Mr.
Leyland	PERSON	is to be unreservedly complimented on his selection of subjects for illustration , and the plates are of good quality mechanically .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volumes VII .

		and
VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		of The World 's Orators '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by Dr.
Guy Carleton Lee	PERSON	, have just been received .

		The first of these volumes completes the section devoted to Englishmen , and includes ten examples , from
Erstine	LOCATION	to
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		The other vol - ume , edited with the assistance of Dr.
Franklin L. Riley	PERSON	, is devoted to American secular oratory of the eighteenth century .

		Thirteen men are represented , among them being
Otis	PERSON	,
Hancock	PERSON	,
Warren	PERSON	,
Henry	PERSON	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, and
Samuel Adams	PERSON	.

		Ten of the thirteen have portraits .

		Two more volumes will complete this dignified and valuable work .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 The third volume of Professor
A. B. Hart	PERSON	's '' Amer - ican History Told by Contemporaries , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, covers the period 1783-1845 , and has for its subject '' National Expansion . ''

		We are glad that this work is nearing completion , because it is of the utmost value to teachers of history in our schools and colleges , and can not too soon be placed within their reach .

		The volumes are of such generous dimensions that they really serve to illuminate the subject , which can not be said of some of the scrappy source books that have recently appeared .

		There is little benefit to be got from the study of source material unless a large amount of it is made accessible to the student .

		It re - quires to be delved in , rather than read consecutively .

		Not librarians alone , but private collectors of books as well , will find in Mr.
Ainsworth Rand Spofford	PERSON	's '' Book for All Readers '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- a helpful guide in many perplexing matters , and a safe informant upon many subjects that must be of interest to all who live among books and use them intelligently .

		The twenty - seven chapters of this volume are simply packed with pertinent facts relating to their several subjects ; such , for example , as bindings , book plates , pamphlets , cata - loguing , copyright , and most of the subjects that con - cern the professional librarian .

		The product of ripe experience , the work is trustworthy , and has , besides , no little charm of manner .

		Four new volumes in
Messrs. Silver	LOCATION	,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Silver Series '' of English texts for schools provide the following material : Rnskin 's '' Sesame and Lilies , '' edited by Miss
Agnes S. Cook	PERSON	;
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Lancelot and Ekine '' and '' The Passing of
Arthur	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
James E. Thomas ; Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` The Traveller '' and '' The Deserted Village , '' edited by Mr.
Frederick Tupper	PERSON	; and Arnold 's '' Sohrab and Rust urn , '' with other poems , edited by Mr.
Joseph B. Seabury	PERSON	.

		NOTES . ''

		A Life in Song , '' a volume of poems by Mr.
George Lansing Raymond	PERSON	, is issued in a second edition by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Longfellow 's ''
Giles Corey	PERSON	of the Salem Farms '' is published , with stage directions , by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their '' Riverside Literature Series . '' ''

		The Principles of Vegetable-Gardening , '' by Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	, is still another of the series of books upon agricultural and horticultural subjects that this indefa - tigable writer has been producing during the past few years .

		It is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new edition of Mr.
Robert S. Barrett	PERSON	's '' Standard Guide to the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	, '' is published in the city with which it is concerned by the
Modern Mexico Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems to be an excellent practical handbook , besides being made attractive by a profusion of illustrations .

		Mr.
Charles L. Bowman	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	, publishes a new edition of '' Hints for Home Reading , '' edited by Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	.

		The contents include a series of papers by such men as
C. D. Warner	ORGANIZATION	,
H. W. Beecher	PERSON	,
F. B. Perkins	PERSON	, Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	, Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, which are followed by a classified '' Book Buyer 's Guide . ''

		A re-issue of ''

Henrietta	LOCATION	,
Daugh	PERSON	- ter of
Charles I.	PERSON	, and Duchess of Orleans , '' by
Julia Cartwright	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Henry Ady	PERSON	-RRB- , first published in
1894	DATE	, is imported by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This care - fully written biography of a singularly attractive and unfortunate princess , with its lesson of courage and patience and cheerfulness , is at all times welcome both to the student and to the general reader , and is none the worse for that tone of perhaps somewhat excessive eulogy which attests the writer 's interest in her theme .

		M Notes on Speech-making '' and '' The Philosophy of the Short-Story , '' both by Professor
Brander	PERSON	Mat - thews , are two small and readable books published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents of both have before been printed in other forms , but we are glad to have them in the present convenient shape . ''

		Brush and Pencil , '' of
Chicago	LOCATION	, which has come to occupy a place distinctively its own among American art journals , has absorbed '' The Collector and Art Critic '' of
New York	LOCATION	, and the latter publication will hereafter cease to exist . ''

		Brush and Pencil '' is now edited and owned by Mr.
F. W. Morton	PERSON	, and under his supervision the magazine has of late shown marked im - provement in appearance and matter .

		The map reproductions of Mr.
B. F. Stevens	PERSON	of Lon - don have for years been well known .

		Of special value to Americans and all interested in American history is his latest reproduction , `` Fac - simile of the Unpublished British Headquarters Map of
New York	LOCATION	and Environs ,
1782	DATE	. ''

		The map is made from the original drawing in the War Office ,
London	LOCATION	, and is in 24 sheets which can be joined and mounted as a whole for wall use , or kept separate in portfolio form .

		But 100 copies are printed , and are offered on subscription only , by Messrs.
B. F. Stevens & Brown	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		A German edition of an American scientific mono - graph is not often met with , although this compliment to sound scholarship is not undeserved by a good many of our recent academic productions .

		Such an honor has recently been paid to Professor
John H. Huddilston	PERSON	, and we have just received -LRB-
Freiburg i. Br	ORGANIZATION	.

		: Fehsenfeld -RRB- a handsomely-printed brochure entitled '' Die
Griech	PERSON	- ische Tragodie im

		The trans - lation is by
Fraulein Maria Hense	PERSON	.

		Fit zed ward
Hall	PERSON	, one of the greatest of American philologists and Oriental scholars , died on the first of
February	DATE	, at his home in
Marlesford	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		He was born in
New York	LOCATION	, in
1825	DATE	, and was educated at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the latter institution he was a classmate of
Childs	ORGANIZATION	,
Lane	PERSON	, and Mr.
C. E. Norton	PERSON	.

		An unexpected trip to
India	LOCATION	in search of a runaway brother , proved a turning - point in his life , and enlisted him in the ranks of orien - talists .

		He remained in
India	LOCATION	until
1862	DATE	, occupying various government posts , returning only for a vacation in
1859	DATE	, when
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	made him a D.C.L. For seven years , he made his home in
London	LOCATION	, where he served in various capacities as professor , librarian , and exam - iner .

		In
1869	DATE	, he removed to
Marlesford	LOCATION	, where the rest of his days were spent .

		Here he completed bis edition of the '' Vishnupurana , '' and began the series of works on English philology by which be is best known to English and American scholars .

		His services to the '' New English Dictionary '' and to the '' Dialect Dic - tionary '' were very great , and were given with no other thought than that of advancing the science to which his life was devoted .

		Readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	will remember the many contributions with which he has enriched its pages , and will join with the many thousands of scholars who deplore his death .

COLUMBUS BRADFORD	PERSON	.

		i2mo ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This work is absolutely unique in
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		Its conclusions may appear to coincide in one essential point with the doctrines of Theosophy , but the course of reasoning by which they are reached is entirely free from mysticism and is in full harmony with the ad - vanced teaching of both
Science and Religion	ORGANIZATION	.

		All who have felt at times the apparent futility of the indi - vidual life will be comforted and uplifted by the brave optimism of this original book .

		The main conclusions of the work are : The human personality does not leave the body at death ; the germ of life persists and in due time returns to another body ; the perfection of the race will be realized through the gradual ameliora - tion in successive lives of its individual members .

		The working hypothesis of the author is : The dead live again by being born again .

		QARCILASO By

		I2mo ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		A clever and amusing story of Spanish life and character at a time which is peculiarly interesting to Americans , the close of the ifth century .

		The scenes in the earlier part of the story are laid in the '' city of silk , '' before the beleaguered walls of
Granada	LOCATION	, and later the hero escapes the spies of the Inquisition by joining the
Columbus	LOCATION	expedition .

		In Garcilaso the author has presented a fine portrait of the Spanish hidalgo , ignorantly religious , haughtily courteous , arrogantly brave .

		The Quixotic Garcilaso tells the tale himself , and there is a subtle irony in the method by which he is made to reveal his foibles while wholly unconscious of their existence .

		The love story is full of complications , now serious , now amusing , which end happily .

		A NOTHER notable book by Mr.

		It is not intended to take the place of the Elements , but to offer a more extended and comprehensive course for schools that wish to devote an entire year to the subject .

		The flora includes seven hundred species .

		The descriptions are written in the very simplest language consistent with accuracy , and technical terms are omitted in every case where ordinary language is sufficiently concise and accurate to answer the purpose .

		STORIES OF PLANT LIFE -LRB- BEADY IN
APRIL	DATE	-RRB- By
GEORGE F. ATKINSON	PERSON	,
Professor of Botany	ORGANIZATION	in
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	.

		T N this new book is presented the unusual and attractive combination of rare scholarship with great felicity 1 in writing for young people .

		The object in presenting these studies in the form of '' Stories of Plant Life '' has been to interest the child and pupil in the life and - work of plants .

		Part IV. , `` Life Stories of Plants , '' the author has presented in the form of biographies .

		This feature of '' reading '' the stories which plants have to tell forms the leading theme which runs through the book .

		The plants talk by a `` sign language , '' which the pupil is encouraged to read and interpret .

		This method lends itself in a happy manner as an appeal to the child 's power of interpretation of the things which it sees .

		This book , by so great an authority as Professor
Atkinson	PERSON	, is certain to provide for the child and the teacher a source from which to obtain both profit and enjoyment .

		NOTES .

		205 THE PRICES OF BOOKS .

		For a number of years past , the condition of the bookselling trade has been a matter of much concern , not only to the booksellers and publishers immediately interested , but also to the wider public that takes an interest in all questions affecting popular culture .

		The prac - tice of publishing books at a fictitious price , never actually demanded , is quite indefensible ; and the custom of selling books at all sorts of discounts , based upon '' what the traffic will bear , '' if not strictly indefensible , is at least so demoralizing to the trade that some effort to secure uniformity of practice is well worth making .

		Under the stress of the forces of competition , the book business has suffered severely in both directions from the side of the publisher and dealer alike and the effect upon the general public has been equally un - fortunate , for the old-time bookstore has almost disappeared from the social economy of all but a few of our largest cities .

		The individual purchaser of books , allured by the inducements of dealers in general merchandise or by the advertisements of houses of supply in the large cities sometimes even by the direct bid of injudicious publishers for the retail trade has deserted the local bookseller , and forced him either to retire from business , or to add all sorts of '' notions '' and * k side lines '' to his stock , thereby becoming a very different sort of person from the bookseller of a generation or two ago .

		After a long period of agitation of these vexed questions , the publishers of the country have at last realized the necessity of concerted action , and have agreed upon a plan , to be put into general operation the first of
May	DATE	, which it is hoped will restore something like uni - formity to the system of discounts , make the retail price of a given book the same wherever purchased , and cause whatever booksellers have survived the demoralizing conditions of recent years to take heart for the future .

		Since the `` plan in question is put forward by the
Ameri	PERSON	- can
Publishers Association	ORGANIZATION	, and agreed upon by nearly all the large and reputable houses , there is at least a fair chance that it will 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, accomplish its purposes .

		At all events , the outcome of the experiment about to be made will be watched for with eager interest by all who are intelligent enough to understand the importance to the whole public of a healthful activity in all the branches of the book trade .

		The essential features of the plan proposed are presented in the following summary .

		All copyright books sold under ordinary trade con - ditions are to be listed at net prices , which prices shall be substantially those now actually charged by the leading booksellers .

		Every intelligent purchaser knows that the real price of a book is only eighty per cent of the ficti - tious price advertised , and the fictitious price is now to be suppressed altogether .

		From this arrangement school books , subscription books , and works of current fiction are to be excluded .

		The publishers then agree to sell their books only to such dealers as will maintain the net retail prices set upon them .

		Thus the book - seller who cuts his prices will also cut himself off from obtaining further supplies .

		Libraries are to receive a discount of ten per cent from retail prices , and the discount to booksellers is to be twenty-five per cent , although this latter stipulation is not binding upon publish - ers .

		A year after publication , the restriction upon booksellers shall cease , although the publisher may then have the right to repur - chase all copies which may remain unsold , at the price which was originally paid for them .

		When the publisher sells his own books at retail , he shall add to the list price the express or postal charges to all customers from out of town , instead of mailing '' postpaid , '' as is now the universal custom excepting with `` net '' books .

		The result of the operation of the plan thus outlined is obvious enough .

		If the publishers concerned shall live up to this agreement in good faith , there will be an end of the under - selling of new copyright books by department stores and dealers in miscellaneous goods .

		There will also be an end of retail mail orders sent direct to publishers from towns that have booksellers of their own .

		The local bookseller will be sure of a reasonable profit upon his sales , and will be encouraged to work up his hitherto languishing trade .

		The department stores will suffer no real loss , and will prob - ably find bookselling as profitable as ever , although no longer able to lure the book-buyer from his proper allegiance , except in the case of popular novels , which will remain unaffected by the new arrangement .

		This is , of course , a very large exception , and it can not be de - fended as a logical one .

		But it is best not to be too radical all at once , and we think that the publishers have acted wisely in admitting this compromise .

		If the plan works well in other respects , it will be no difficult matter to bring fiction within its scope in the near future .

		Indeed , we augur well for the new departure chiefly because it is so moderate in its terms .

		So limited a measure of reform as this has ten times the chances of success that a thorough - going reform would have .

		And yet , limited as it is , we think that it can accomplish much for the encouragement of legitimate booksell - ing , and for the rehabilitation of one of the worthiest and most civilizing of human occu - pations .

		The example of the German book trade has been chiefly influential in determining this plan of the American publishers .

		The general system for controlling prices , as now proposed for this country , has long been in successful operation among German publishers and book - sellers , with results that fully justify its wis - dom .

		Although opposed in
Germany	LOCATION	by a few obdurate undersellers , the opposition has not been sufficiently formidable to interfere seri - ously with the plan , and is now almost com - pletely overcome .

		The result has been , and is , that German books are sold at uniform prices throughout the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and , what is far more important , the German bookseller is enabled to earn a livelihood from his business .

		Every German town of any size has at least one well - appointed book-shop , and this condition of af - fairs is so warmly appreciated by the public that few voices would now be raised in favor of a return to the old disastrous system of com - petitive underselling .

		It is distinctly worth while to increase slightly the cost of books to individual purchasers , if thereby the business of dealing in books may be kept in the hands of bookmen , and if books of all sorts may thus be brought within the easy reach of book - buyers .

		In expressing our approval of this plan , as about to be inaugurated in the American trade , we are not blinking the fact that it means higher retail prices for a good many books .

		As a general rule , we believe in the most open and unrestricted competition in business af - fairs , and are opposed to regulations , whether public or private , in restraint of trade .

		But
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 181 it seems to us that the book trade is of so pecul - iar a nature , and bears so important a relation to the culture of the community , that it de - serves to be dealt with on an exceptional basis .

		However sound in principle the doctrine of unrestricted competition may be , its rigorous application to the present case would seem to suggest the doctrinaire theorist rather than the philosophical observer .

		It is a form of trade protection , no doubt , but , however sinister the associations of that word , fair-minded people must admit that there are instances in which protection is the policy of wisdom rather than of selfish interest .

		This seems to us to be clearly one of those instances , and we assert without hesitation that a flourishing book trade is of such vital importance to the civilization of any community that a community may prop - erly be taxed for its support .

		The tax in question will be a small one , and its incidence will be upon the persons most directly bene - fitted .

		which seems to us all that need be urged in its defence .

		INTERMITTENT IDEALISM .

		It would be hard to believe that
Milton	PERSON	ever doubted of the poetic vision , or would have ex - changed it .

		if he could , for a practical view of life .

		His weighing of the matter in '' Lycidas '' is evi - dently more for the sake of argument , to set forth the grounds of his impregnable conviction , than to voice any question of his own mind .

		He was too thorough-going an idealist , even in the days when sportive Amaryllis conld allure , to be seriously moved by the pleasures or practices of others .

		His profound and capacious nature was stayed on itself in a composure whence no accident or affliction could drive it A spirit privileged , like his , to con - template all time and all existence could withstand with ease shocks that perturb or destroy smaller souls , attractions that would draw them from their orbits .

		It is not , however , a common privilege to view in this large ab extra way the matters which make up one 's personal share of conscious existence .

		If hell and heaven were opened to an ordinary mortal , in a vision like
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's , no such tremendous effect would be produced .

		The traveller would return , like other personally conducted tourists , with scarce a recollection of the things he saw .

		If he did re - member some singular impression , it would be to congratulate himself on having only familiar ex - periences to deal with thereafter .

		The value of such observation as against commonly received opinion would be insignificant .

		The joys of the Paradiso would distil no life-long sweetness in his heart .

		For the bartering and selling and envy - ing and talking of everyday life are more real than the eternal verities to him who is not born with the mystic vision , and would be , though one rose from the dead to tell .

		Honest
Sancho	PERSON	has been proved right so often that even the would-be
Quixote	PERSON	gives over denying , and begins to lose faith himself .

		Indeed , the idealistic temperament is a gift as inconvenient as some we read of in old fairy tales , which may fall into bad hands , which bring suffer - ing if ill-used , and yet can not be got rid of .

		This talisman may diffuse the steady glow that warms and transfigures , or it may yield but a flickering flame .

		Sometimes , as with
Burns	PERSON	, its fitful illumi - nation reveals the rocks on which the hopeless mariner drives , but is not strong enough to enable him to steer clear .

		Sometimes we follow the vague gleam until we feel , as the poet dough did of Car - lyle 's impassioned leadership , that it has led us out into the wilderness to die .

		Despondency is a frequent enough mood in the most practical career , whose rewards are patent to all , and which has the approval of the whole world .

		How much larger must be the natural proportion of discouragement in attempts which lie outside the sphere of common effort , and whose success , if recognizable , attracts but cold attention .

		Minds enamored of perfection have a wintry road to travel in a world where the expedient and relative alone are appreciated .

		To run a race with straining con - testants at your heels , amid the plaudits of sympa - thizing acquaintance , with a great prize in sight , is quite different from a lonely sprint , without spec - tators , toward an elusive goal which everybody pronounces an optical illusion .

		The bravest run - ners are weighed down by the tacit opposition , as by heavy atmospheric pressure .

		Wordsworth even , with all his deliberate planning to live the life of the spirit , had his moments when he prayed for pagan faith , that he might recapture his lost sense of the hidden beauty of the world .

		For him some - times , as for poor
Susan	PERSON	in his song , '' The stream would not flow , and the bill would not rise , And the colors had all passed away from his eyes . ''

		And
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the most wonderful mind , so far as we know , that the human race has ever produced , tells what he feels , '' When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes , I , all alone , beweep my outcast state , And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries , And look upon myself , and curse my fate , Wishing me more like to one more rich in hope , Featured like him , like him with friends possest , Desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope , With what I most enjoy contented least . ''

		If these are the feelings with which the sons of Phoebus are at times overwhelmed , what must be the dismay and weakening of the knees of the com - 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, mon mortal who essays this quest .

		Uneasy regret for him that turns hack ; no complacent success for the victor ; between the two , all variations of defeat and discouragement .

		But ah , what compensation !

		After
Lowell	PERSON	has given the details of the Florentine 's exile , he adds these words : '' Looked at outwardly ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's life was an utter and disastrous failure .

		What its in - ward satisfactions were , we , with the Paradiso open before us , can form some faint conception . ''


Newman	PERSON	says , in his Apologia , that he used to wish that the Arabian Tales were true .

		His imagination ran on unseen influences , magical powers , and talis - mans .

		The human soul has other ways of escaping its limitations , and these influences need not be in - voked with such potentialities within .

		In the son - net quoted from above ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is absorbed in forced contemplation of conventional values , when the thought of his love suffices to release him , and , like the lark , rising from sullen earth , straightway his soul mounts and sings at heaven 's gate .

		One may be held by peremptory custom and have prac - tical views thrust upon one , until resistance seems useless , and the voice of the majority is admitted to be the voice of God .

		One rush of disinterested feeling , an
evening	TIME	sky , the pure outline of a distant hill , and the old charm is set working , and the spirit is released .

		Lines of verse , by no means didactifc , sometimes work this transformation , when the most powerful exhortations of
Emerson	LOCATION	or
Browning	PERSON	or
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	have been ineffectual .

		Lan - dor 's lines to Rose
Aylmer	PERSON	have no connection with effort of any kind , yet they have this melting quality to me .

		With the haunting music of ''
Rose Ayl	PERSON	- mer '' in my ears , I can shake off any weight of freezing custom , and do the impossible in chasing the flying goal .

		Marlowe and those other
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan playwrights loved the sound of Greek , though they knew not a word of it , because it had such a thundering sound , as if it conjured devils .

		We know that certain words , as well as holy water , did conjure devils in the romantic Middle Age ; and , sure , certain dark fears and doubts that vex men 's minds now , may be exorcised by means as simple and irrelevant .

		The subterranean life from which great impulses come , does not respond to logical appeals .

		That naive old lady who drew such con - solation from the rich sound of the word
Mesopo	PERSON	- tamia , knew the potency of suggestion to open charmed , magic casements upon large and noble scenes .

		At a touch , apparently remote and power - less , the importunate claims of society , the involved situations that cramp and school the soul to petty issues , yea , the great globe itself and all which it inherit , may , like the baseless fabric of a vision , fade into thin air , and leave but the freed spirit face to face with immensity .

		In the revolution of feeling
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	describes in his sonnet , no ex - ternal change has taken place .

		Others have ad - vantages generally prized which he has not .

		This is the occasion of his grief , though the real cause probably lay in a deeper dissatisfaction .

		Suddenly a tender thought wells up from the unconscious deep .

		He is no richer , handsomer , greater than before , yet now he would not change his state with kings .

		This is your true idealist .

		The impulse , denied to his prayer of anguish , has come unfore - seen , but here it is , and '' the moon , it is under his feet . ''

		In a twinkling , this mortal has put on im - mortality .

		From a clod , a thing of causes and effects , he is become a living soul and lays hold on eternal life .

		Upon this most excellent text I should like to preach a very short sermon .

		That this is the only way in which it ought to be done , is one of those obvious propo - sitions that needs only to be clearly stated to gain en - dorsement .

		How far it is a good thing that the great dailies have invaded so comprehensively the field of criticism of books , is a question that need not be decided in this connection .

		That they have done so and will continue to do so is obvious ; and I am equally convinced that , if it be wisely done , the good will far outweigh the in - cidental evils .

		Every publisher knows how large a part of his copies for review go to the great dailies , and how frequently his press notices must be compiled from the same source .

		In the aggregate , the papers are influ - encing the opinions on matters of literature of an enormous proportion of the wisely-reading and of the unwisely-reading public .

		Their responsibilities are large , however lightly they may be carried .

		Many an excel - lent daily paper -LRB- I mean relatively so , in contrast to the many more that are worse -RRB- is well made up , obvi - ously gives special attention to its various departments , but fails utterly on the score of its book-reviews .

		I fancy that the volumes which too confiding publishers send on a venture to the best papers are swept together periodically and carried off by some omnivorous but most undiscerniug reader , who reviews or concocts no - tices of them of various degrees of merit or the absence of it .

		On the topics that interest him he produces something readable or at least coherent ; the others are smudged over with a non-committal paragraph which means black or white or any intermediate shade of grey .

		These neutral , conventionally-phrased , damned - with-faint-praise testimonials are easily recognizable in collections of '' press-notices . ''

		I have mainly in mind the great dailies away from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast , which are , indeed , the worst offend - ers in this respect .

		I have specially in mind the paper
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 which stimulates the digestion of my breakfast , which certainly is careful as to its political and general news , its foreign items , its editorials , its sports , and its ac - counts of crime ; which also contains an admirable musical and dramatic column ; but whose book-reviews , and indeed all attempts to consider matters of science or literature in any part of its columns , are shockingly bad .

		Not always so , for when the professional book - reviewer gets hold of a book which is in his line , he pro- duces a creditable notice .

		The wrong is that he should be called upon to give utterance to criticisms upon things which he does not understand , even if he reads them which in some cases is doubtful .

		Within a short time I recall two contributions which may be given as concrete examples .

		The one was an editorial on a sensational announcement of a scientific worker of no unquestioned standing , in which were massed such a collection of gross errors and misconcep - tions as would hardly be excusable in a high school pupil .

		The other was a review of a book in regard to which every remark made was utterly inappropriate , and would have been about equally pertinent if the book had been
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary or Euclid 's geom - etry , instead of , as it was , a series of essays on certain popular phases of science .

		The very next day appeared a laudatory appreciation of a manual of the most un - scientific , superstitious kind which was not worth serious attention , and then -LRB- all probably by the same hand -RRB- a good and worthy review of a volume which the reviewer had read and appreciated .

		This is the absurdity of the way in which the great dailies issue opinions on literary and scientific matters ; this is what makes '' newspaper science '' a term of deri - sion , and brings it about that you can find wholesale laudation of almost any effusion which an author can persuade or bribe a publisher to print .

		The remedy is obvious .

		It is to have this work at least as carefully allotted as the various departments of the sporting page , and have books reviewed and editorials written by persons who are acquainted with the particular facts and opinion discussed , not by one who must profession - ally pose as a concentrated omniscience .

		Within the reach of the great dailies are professors at the
Univer	LOCATION	- sities , and specialists in all departments , who should be willing to assume this function as part of their civic ob - ligations ; and it should be the policy of the great dailies , if they review books at all , to be willing to have it properly done and make the doing of it an attractive privilege to the scholar and the specialist .

		The notion that the scholar is not to be trusted , is given to fads , will not abide by practical conditions of space and read - ability , may be true of a small minority , but in regard to the great majority of whom such service would nat - urally be asked , it is simply a superstition , a survival in current beliefs kept alive by the jokes and jibes of the mentally impoverished paragrapher .

		The great dailies have no excuse in this direction .

		It is in most cases a neglect due to a lack of appreciation of their possibilities and their responsibilities , and one which , it is hoped , they will be anxious to atone for as speedily and as effectively as may be possible .

		As disseminators of opinion upon all topics which they decide to fall within their scope , it should be the aim and the boast of the dailies that they print the fittest news , and the most reliable opinions , even including the news and opinions of the world of science and letters and art .

		THE EDITING OF
POE	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The distress of your correspondent , '' S. , '' in THE DIAL for
Feb. 1	DATE	, over the supposed misquotation in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's Anthology , is another straw which shows how set the winds of American appreciation of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our poets , even
Poe	PERSON	, are household poets , well-loved , memorized , but not critically studied .

		Now
Poe	PERSON	is the only one of them of whose works we have something like a definitive critical edition , and yet so little is that known that a supposed error in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's Anthol - ogy does not suggest a comparison with Messrs. Sted - man and
Woodberry 's Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can scarcely conceive of an Englishman using his
Tennyson	PERSON	thus .

		The communication is further interesting as showing the futility of a priori aesthetic reasoning . ''

		Gray eye glances '' is called a '' distressing alliteration '' of which Poe would have been incapable !

		Yet Tennyson changed '' The tall masts quiver 'd as they lay afloat '' -LRB- '' Dream of Fair Women '' -RRB- to '' The high masts flicker 'd as they lay afloat , '' and , though the change was compelled by other changes in the same stanza , the alliteration was not found offensive .

		And how should alliteration have been offensive to the poet of '' weak and weary , '' `` quaint and curious , '' `` nodded , nearly napping , '' `` named Lenore '' ?

		The simple fact is that we are used to `` dark eye glances '' ; and poets may take a lesson upon the danger of changing their printed text . ''

		These old shoes , '' said
Emerson	PERSON	, '' are easy to my feet . ''

		The really interesting question under all this is the wisdom of Messrs.
Stedman	PERSON	and
Woodberry	PERSON	's adoption of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's marginal emendations .

		Their general principle , which they defend , is doubtless right , and it would be too delicate a task -LRB- a priori reasoning again -RRB- to decide that the principle should be departed from in any par - ticular instance .

		Yet in this instance '' gray eyes '' was substituted after
1845	DATE	, and
Poe	PERSON	's judgment in those latter disastrous years might well be questioned .

		Was the change made for purely aesthetic reasons , or out of personal caprice ?

		We might at least be pardoned for preferring to keep the color of the eyes which originally inspired the poem .

		`` PROFESSOR TRIGQS ON PROFESSOR WENDELL . ''

		- A REPLY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read , in your issue of
March 1	DATE	, Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	TealFs comments on my criticism of Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	.

		I am very sure that when Mr.
Gardner Teall	PERSON	comes to read '' A Literary History of America '' he will not be tempted himself and he will not in the least understand my temptation .

		Living in the midst of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	culture and
Massachusetts Transcenden	ORGANIZATION	- talism and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Unitarianism , he can never be made to feel how little these things enter into the con - sciousness of one who has lived in the South and West , and he will read Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's 479 pages on Amer - ican Literature in
Boston	LOCATION	with perfect contentment , and dismiss the Rest of the Story with a single chapter .

		My questions were asked in all seriousness and were intended to arouse thought .

		That they do not appear as an '' examination test '' is proven by the fact that Mr.
Teall	PERSON	attempts to answer them without having read the book under discussion .

		-LRB- But perhaps Mr.
Teall	PERSON	acquired this habit when he was at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		If I was rude and irreverent it was because of bad manners acquired by association with the class of '' social de - 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, generates '' that Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	declares to have settled in the West the class that produced Lincoln and Grant .

		We have had the advantages of nothing better than missionary stations most of us , like
Eugene Field	PERSON	, were only lately driven out of the trees .

		Mr.
Teall	PERSON	's answer to one question propounded is not very convincing .

		If one is to write a literary history of
America	LOCATION	he should take account of all the literatures of
America	LOCATION	: if he confines himself to literature in En - glish should he call his work '' A Literary History of
America	LOCATION	'' ?

		What lies back of the
Mardi Gras	LOCATION	festival at
New Orleans	LOCATION	must surely balance the life forces of
New England Transcendentalism	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Teall	PERSON	's suggestion for chronicling the literary doings of the
United States	LOCATION	by parishes strikes me as a good one .

		When Mr.
Teall	PERSON	finishes his Whitman and his Wendell I hope he will read the two volumes on the literature of
Indiana	LOCATION	reviewed by Mr.
Martin W. Sampson	PERSON	in THE DIAL of
March 1	DATE	.


Indiana	LOCATION	is a typical Western parish .

		The writer of '' The Hoosiers , '' Mr.
Sampson	PERSON	remarks , '' traces the growth of the intellec - tual life within the
State	ORGANIZATION	, from its territorial beginnings to the present day ; the varying make-up of its popu - lation ; the individual marks of its most characteristic institutions and towns : in short , he soberly essays a chapter in American cultur-geschicte , dealing with the
State	ORGANIZATION	whose life he knows from within . ''

		The other volume is a book of selections from
Indiana	LOCATION	poets one hundred and forty-six in number .

		There would certainly be no blank page for this parish , and perhaps material enough -LRB- with
Riley	PERSON	,
Thompson	PERSON	,
Evaleen Stein	PERSON	, and a few others , as demi-gods -RRB- for as considerable a mythology as has been developed in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Upon the blank pages reserved for other parishes I would indeed write passages from Whitman : upon one I would inscribe '' Unnamed Lands , '' on another '' There Was a Child Went Forth , '' on toother `` The Ox - Tamer , '' on another -LRB- if there should be that many blanks -RRB- '' Laws for Creations . ''

		I am more inclined to this suggestion , because , as I gather from answers to my questions received from
New Orleans	LOCATION	and
San Francisco	LOCATION	, this is precisely the method pursued by Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	only he has filled up the blanks with Ref - erences and Index .

		And I have one more question upon the general theme : What justification is there for the time-honored belief that a man is not historically significant until he is dead ?

		If the rule is to be broken in the case of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, why need it be obeyed in other instances ?

		Besides the Memoir this volume embraces the paper on `` Count

		He was , his sister and affectionate biographer records , a pretty and clever child , fond of books , flowers , pictures , music , and '' good things to eat , '' and blessed , or perhaps afflicted , with so fastidious a sense of the relations be - tween taste and smell that he used to insist on the union on the dinner-table of certain flowers with certain viands sweet peas , for instance , being in the opinion of this young Sybarite the indispensable floral associate of roast beef .

		THE DIAL 185 rather have the complete works of one poet than another man 's selections from the works of all of them .

		At fifteen he was entered at
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, where , we learn , he worked not for honors bat from natural love of learning .

		Honors came , however , a
Clark	PERSON	premium for proficiency in Latin in his junior year , and in his senior year a
Berkeley	LOCATION	prize for Latin composition .

		He was graduated fifth in a class of over a hundred , and had the rank of
Philo	LOCATION	- sophical Oration , taking also the
Berkeley	LOCATION	and
Clark Scholarships	ORGANIZATION	.

		A classmate of
Schuyler	PERSON	's , Professor
Wright	PERSON	, of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, has testified warmly to his personal charm and refinement , his pre - cocious attainments , and natural taste and ap - titude for exact scholarship and broad culture .

		After graduating , in
1859	DATE	, Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	remained at
New Haven	LOCATION	for two years , and was the first to receive there , in
1861	DATE	, the de - gree of
Doctor of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		He studied law at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, and , after a period of preparatory office work , began practice with Mr.
James Bruyn Andrews	PERSON	as partner .

		His bent for literature showed itself early .

		During the period of his law studies he wrote pretty constantly for the '' Round Table , '' the '' New Path , '' the `` New Englander , '' and the '' North American Review , '' and was a contributor to ** The Nation '' from the time of its first ap - pearance to the end of his life .

		In
1867	DATE	he published a translation of Turguenief 's ''
Fath	PERSON	- ers and Sons , '' and this was shortly followed by his edition of Professor
Porter	PERSON	's transla - tions from the '' Kalevala , '' a task for which , with his usual thoroughness , he prepared him - self by learning Finnish in order to master the poem in the original .

		The practice of law was not especially to Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's taste , and in
1867	DATE	he forsook Themis for the foreign ser - vice , obtaining an appointment as Consul at
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		On the way to his post he formed some notable acquaintances that of
M. Taine	PERSON	at
Paris	LOCATION	, of Sainte-Beuve , and of Turguenief , who gave him a letter of introduction to Tol - stoy .

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	had the social gift , and was , in fact , socially as well as officially always persona gratissima at the various courts to which he was , during his long career abroad , accredited .

		At
Moscow	LOCATION	, as later at St.
Peters	PERSON	- burg , he was even , as his biographer assures us with a certain touch of '' Mrs.
Jarley	PERSON	, '' the '' enfant gate '' of the native nobility and gen - try , from Prince Odoiefsky downward .

		Of his friend the Prince , Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	wrote in
1867	DATE	: '' ... I dined last night with the Prince
Vladimir Oddiefsky	PERSON	, enfamille , with his wife and one young man whose name I ca n't recall .

		The Prince is an agreeable old man of about sixty-five , a bibliophile , with a splen - did library which overflows every room except one salon , where plants in profusion take the place of books .

		... The Prince is also a musician .

		Nothing would do but I must try a duet with him ; so we played half a dozen , apparently to his satisfaction , for he compli - mented me a good deal , and then showed me , as a special favor , a piano he had had made on mathemat - ical principles .

		... I pleased the old lady by showing her a new game of solitaire , and am invited to a salon on
Friday	DATE
evening	TIME	, when I am to be introduced to the haute societe of
Moscow	LOCATION	. ''

		With the change of administration in
1869	DATE	came the usual division of spoils .

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	seems to have ingenuously fancied that his proved special fitness for his post would cause his retention in it .

		He was soon undeceived .

		During a trip to
Kief	PERSON	he received information that he had been superseded , and that his pay had stopped some weeks before .

		The consul - ship at Revel -LRB- something by no means '' equally as good '' -RRB- was offered him ; but in the mean - time Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	, the new Minister to
Russia	LOCATION	, who knew absolutely nothing of the ways or speech of the people to whom he was sent , found himself obliged to blink political con - siderations and select a subordinate who could supply his deficiencies .

		Accordingly Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	went to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	as Secretary of
Legation	LOCATION	, where he soon became a notable and even a leading figure in diplomatic circles .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	resigned in
1872	DATE	, and was suc - ceeded by Mr.
Orr	PERSON	, through whom Mr.
Schuy	PERSON	- ler obtained a leave of absence which enabled him to visit
Central Asia	LOCATION	a region just then specially interesting as the new field of Russian political enterprise .

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's journey was an arduous one , but he returned well laden with information , which was embodied later in his book on
Central Asia	LOCATION	, as well as , it may be added , in the famous report for the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, the frankness of which raised quite a gale of excitement in Russian official circles at the time .

		This report was prepared at the request of Mr.
Jewell	PERSON	-LRB- Mr.
Orr	PERSON	's suc - cessor at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	-RRB- who , like Mr.
Schuy	PERSON	- ler , supposed it would be considered a confi - dential document .

		The
Department	ORGANIZATION	, however , published , in the Red Book of
December , 1874	DATE	, Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's blunt account of Russian in - iquities in the new satrapy , and a great hubbub ensued .

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's report bore good fruit in the shape of reforms in
Central Asia	LOCATION	, and it is an error to suppose that his frankness em - broiled him with the Russian Government 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, always ready to wink at the reprehensible acts of its agents so long as they go on unnoticed of the world and to
Russia	LOCATION	's material profit , and to disclaim them when notoriety and pub - lic clamor seem to imperil the testamentary policy of the great Czar .

		In 1880 Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	wrote to a friend : '' I suppose it is impossible to eradicate a popular error , but the Russian Government never found fault with me in any way or shape , and never hinted at my recall either in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	or
Washington	LOCATION	... I remained after that -LRB- the publication of the Report -RRB- as Charge d' Affaires for more than a year . ''

		Mr.
Boker	PERSON	accepted the Russian mission in
1874	DATE	, and in
1876	DATE	Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	was appointed Consul-General and
Secretary of Legation	ORGANIZATION	at
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		On his way thither he stopped at
Belgrade	LOCATION	, then in a turmoil of anti-Turkish patriotism , and where he saw Prince
Milan	LOCATION	, who , it is now curious to note , impressed him as a `` very remarkable young man , '' and '' singularly intelligent and well-informed . ''

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	adds : '' He gave me much information about
Serbia	LOCATION	, and in the course of his talk showed me that he was well acquainted with
America	LOCATION	, and followed the march of events there better , I fear , than do many Americans in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The story of Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's services to hu - manity in helping to dispel the cloud discreetly thrown by the Disraeli government over the atrocities in
Bulgaria	LOCATION	of Toryism 's protege the '' unspeakable Turk , '' is too well known to need repetition here .

		To parallel the deeds done in that hapless country by the
Bashi	LOCATION	- Bazouks it is necessary to revert to the days of Attila or
Tamerlane	LOCATION	, or , alas !

		to more recent events in
China	LOCATION	, over which
Christendom	LOCATION	would fain draw a veil .

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	started for
Bulgaria	LOCATION	on his mission of investigation in
July , 1876	DATE	.

		With him went Mr.
McGahan	PERSON	of the '' Daily News , '' the
London	LOCATION	paper which deserves honorable mention for its disclosure to the British nation of the real state of affairs in the Turkish prov - inces , and its disproof of Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	's pleas - ant theory that the Bashi-Bazouk , so far from being the bloody monster depicted by '' coffee - house babble , '' sentimental philanthropy , and sensational journalism , was , in point of fact , a mild and peaceable '' Circassian '' who was not only sweetly incapable of harming anybody , but was himself cruelly persecuted by his Bul - garian neighbors .

		Whether Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	was deliberately lying , for diplomatic ends , or was really persuaded of the truth of the cruel non - sense he was uttering , is uncertain ; but it was soon made plain to him that
England	LOCATION	was in no mood for fooling , and was determined to know the truth about
Bulgaria	LOCATION	.

		What that truth was , was soon made plain through the reports of Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	, and may be gathered in its shocking details from the extracts from his diary and letters in the present Memoir .

		Of the proceedings of the abortive Confer - ence of the Powers at
Constantinople	LOCATION	which followed the disclosure of the facts , as of the events in the city during the war which fol - lowed the failure of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	, the Me - moir affords some interesting glimpses .

		When hostilities were virtually over , and the Russians were at
San Stefano	LOCATION	,
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	arrived at
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		Regarding his view of the situation Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	says : '' Grant is very strong in his ideas against the Turks and what ought to be done with
Turkey	LOCATION	... Among other things the
General	ORGANIZATION	said : ' Had I been in the posi - tion of the Grand Duke
Nicholas	PERSON	, I should have re - fused to make peace except at
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		The occupation of
Constantinople	LOCATION	for the English fleet could not have prevented it would have been an ac - complished fact , which the European Powers would have bad to treat as best they could .

		I should have insisted on one condition that Turkish rule in
Europe	LOCATION	had forever come to an end . ' ''

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	's Bulgarian revelations had not endeared him to the Turks , who , with dip - lomatic indirection , soon began complaining of him on the score of his too vigorous support of his
Government	ORGANIZATION	's treaty rights in their coun - try .

		A leave of absence was given him , to relieve the situation , and he was soon trans - ferred to the consulship at
Birmingham	LOCATION	a stop - gap , as it proved , for in
1879	DATE	he was made Consul - General at
Rome	LOCATION	, where his posi - tion was an agreeable one , despite the refusal of the punctilious and venerable Minister , Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	, to present him at
Court	ORGANIZATION	, on the ground that it '' would be derogatory to the dignity of the
Service	ORGANIZATION	to associate the Commercial with the Diplomatic branch in social matters . ''

		Our author adds , '' To a man who had been used to being on pleasant terms with royalty in many countries , this view was unexpected . ''

		Mr.
Schuyler	PERSON	, however , survived this early frost , and was soon pleasantly sunning himself as usual in the favor of the court circle to the scandal , we infer , of the conscientious Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	.

		In
1880	DATE	Mr.

		OUR IDEA OF TRAGEDY .

		* In the last five years the young play-goer and play-reader may well have wondered whether in his father 's time , or his grand - father 's , there were brought out any such plays as now .

		Such a one has considered the reso - lute and earnest probings of

		Is it merely because they are of our own time that we hold these plays , these men , great ?

		I can not , for one thing , take Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's '' The Second Mrs. Tanqueray '' as typical of the present idea of tragedy or as earnest of the future : Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	seems to hold some such idea .

		Now I have just reread the play -LRB- between the last sentence and this -RRB- and that with great pleasure , for it is a strong and moving piece of work .

		But I can not regard it as a great tragedy for a reason that is worth noting be - cause of its connection with all Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	's dealing with the subject from - JSschykis down .

		It may seem pedantic at the present moment , but I have long been impressed with the keen - ness of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's view of the effect of tragedy and that view I have understood rather differ - ently from Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 38 , 39 -RRB- believes that
Aristotle	PERSON	held that tragedy was useful as a purge because the spectators , seeing '' what fools the tragic char - acters made of themselves by indulging in such emotions -LRB- as pity and fear -RRB- left the theatre '' chastened and humble , realizing that feelings are dangerous guides , and emotional displays the mark of a feeble nature .

		Now , I have never interpreted the famous passage of Aris - totle in that sense , nor , it may be added , have I ever felt thus on leaving the theatre .

		My understanding of Aristotle has been that the pity and fear roused by tragedy were such emotions as purged out of the character -LRB- merely for the time perhaps -RRB- all small and petty fears and weaknesses .

		And when
Aristotle	PERSON	said that tragedy purged the soul , he meant that the soul of any spectator who had seen before him the awful agony of Prometheus or CEdipus , was , while under the influence of the tragedy , purged or cleansed of his own small fears and pains . ''

		What are our woes and suff ranee ? ''

		as
Byron	PERSON	said of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Some such feeling as this I have supposed Aristotle had in mind when he lectured on the Katharsis , and some such feeling I have often had when the curtain fell on a tragedy , a species of calmness , of rest , after emotional conflict .

		On the whole Aris - totle 's doctrine seems a little too confined : he held that tragedy purged the mind of its own vicious pity and fear .

		It would seem as though it might purge the mind of many another feel - ing .

		But even with the limitation of Aristotle one can not very well adopt the rather narrow view of tragedy taken by Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	, who , 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, by the way , has very slight regard for the Stagirite .

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	presents the leading idea of tragedy as a conflict -LRB- p. 43 -RRB- : the essential character of the Greek drama lay in the conflict between the human will and fate -LRB- p. 43 -RRB- , in the Shakespearean drama between man and the laws of the universe -LRB- p. 70 -RRB- .

		So far his treat - ment is consistent enough , though probably not sufficient .

		But when we come to modern tragedy , the idea seems to be different .

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	says of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, whom he regards rather dubiously , that his idea of tragedy is '' the failure on the part of a given individual to achieve his mission '' -LRB- p. 124 -RRB- , and he adds that this '' might be the description of every tragedy in the world 's history . ''

		But this later formula does not seem precisely the same as that which we had before , though presumably not inconsistent with it .

		Nor , if we return a moment to `` The Second Mrs. Tanqueray , '' shall we find that it is to be called a tragedy -LRB- let alone a great one -RRB- by this definition or by the earlier one .

		What is it that makes Paula Tanqueray a tragic figure ?

		That her life is a conflict ?

		that she fails to achieve her mission ?

		Not at all : she has no mission , nor is her life more of a conflict than is usual .

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	does not say why she is to be thought of as tragic : he says -LRB- p. 129 -RRB- , '' The character of
Paula Tanqueray	PERSON	is one of the most triumphant creations which has ever been composed for the stage , '' but he does not say why she is to be thought of as a tragic figure ; and a careful study of his three lectures shows that if we ac - cept his views , Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	is not what he thinks she is .

		My own idea of tragedy is somewhat different from Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	's .

		It is , I am sorry to say , rather a cloudy , sometimes even a muddled , idea , but such as it is , it takes in Mrs.
Tan	PERSON	- queray better than Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	's idea does .

		So I shall try to explain it .

		There is a great deal in the relation of in - dividuals to the world in general that appears to us very strange .

		Sometimes things go ex - actly right , just as we expect , wish , hope , or think or admit they ought to go .

		There is no tragedy in such matters , although these things are not always pleasing .

		Often they are very sad .

		For example , the death of a noble young fellow in war is in itself not tragic .

		It may become a tragedy when we think of its effect upon his widowed mother whose life had been absorbed into him , or upon somebody else .

		But in itself such a death , although one of the very sad things of life , is a wholly noble and fitting end to a devoted and unselfish life .

		It is not tragic : Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	was quite right when she spoke of the young Lombard soldier in the hospital as '' young antipathetic with dying . ''

		And like such a death is many an event in life which we can not refuse to acknowledge pre - cisely what it ought to be , and these events , happy or unhappy , we do not call tragic .

		But there are also many events in life , many combinations of individual and universe as we might say , which we do not understand thor - oughly , which appear to us quite incongruous , paradoxic , inconsistent , and not at all explain - able according to our previous ideas .

		These combinations may be ridiculous when they are trivial , may be interesting when they are not trivial but still of no great import , may be both from different standpoints , and are tragic when they concern the great interests of those who have our sympathy .

		Thus QEdipus , to use one of Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	's examples , is a tragic figure , not because free will struggles with fate , but because we have here a good man who has un - wittingly got into a horrible plight , he has done things so horrible that to try to realize them makes the heart almost stop beating .

		And why ?

		No answer : good men ought not be in - volved in such difficulties ; we would not even wish bad men such luck .

		And such a spec - tacle chills one -LRB- much as
Aristotle	LOCATION	says -RRB- : it is one of those cases where the human mind says to itself that in spite of every precaution , all prudence , sagacity , far-seeing wisdom , one may fall into horrible evil .

		And that is tragedy , for we can not say why it should be so .

		Then take Hamlet , to get something typical of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here is a man who has almost everything of the best kind given him to begin the world with , position , brains , heart ; he should be one to make his mark .

		Instead , he finds himself in such a position that he hurries along the course of events and is murdered .

		That is tragic , not as being a conflict , not even because the man is broken against one of the laws of the universe .

		It is tragic because when the conditions are once given we do not deny a single step , yet we can not see why it should have happened at all .

		Granted that Hamlet was too weak of will , how did he get so ?

		By too much thinking ?

		Is not thinking the great faculty of man , the thing that raises him above the beasts ?

		Why should too much thought put the thinker in the power of the circumstances around him ?

		We do not under - stand these things .

		No one understands
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 189 '' Hamlet '' ; as soon as one understands it , it ceases to be tragedy .

		And to come down to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	mentions a number of plays , let us take 44 An Enemy of the People . ''

		Is
Stockmann	ORGANIZATION	a tragic figure ?

		Certainly , if conflict be the essence of tragedy , for he is always in a con - flict .

		But I fancy no one will finish the play with the idea that they have seen a tragedy : they have seen a resolute battle between one man and a hundred or more ; the man gave as good as he got and at the end was ready to go on .

		He is not a tragic figure -LRB- although a fine one -RRB- nor is the play a tragedy .

		When we turn to '' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' we find something different .

		We have here a conflict , certainly , between man and wife : but that is not tragedy , we understand that well enough for practical purposes ; a brawling house is not tragic .

		But in '' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' it was an extraordinary case , or perhaps it only seemed so because of the skill in putting the case .

		Here were two people who might have lived happily , in the main that is , with no more disagreement than is well enough to accentuate trust and affec - tion .

		And why did they not ?

		Well , the world is going on nowadays and people are acting under influences that often they do not understand .

		A hundred years ago
Nora	PERSON	and
Thorvald	PERSON	would have understood each other well enough .

		To-day they do not , and we are not far enough from them to do much better .

		Therefore , as they are both our friends , they are tragic in our sight .

		There might have been happiness , but there was unhappiness .

		Was it by accident ?

		Could they help it ?

		Do we understand it ?

		No , to all three .

		We do not understand
Nora	PERSON	, and , as Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	remarks , when interpreted by
Duse	PERSON	we under - stand her less than ever .

		Such is tragedy always , a pursuing of some of the strange and unexplainable courses of life .

		The finer and nobler the actors , the greater and more universal the evil which they do not escape , the greater the tragedy .

		This is the tragic element in the story of the
Due de Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is , on the whole , an attrac - tive man with a good head and heart and great ambitions .

		People love him : he ought to do well .

		Now he does not do well at all , because although he has an immensely daring imagina - tion , he has also a besetting triviality that pre - vents his ever understanding what it really is that he is trying to do .

		It does not appear that he had the remotest comprehension of what it meant to be
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	.

		He knew that his father had been a glorious con - queror , and he knew accurately the uniforms of his father 's army .

		But he does not seem to have known much more .

		The figure offers , then , one of those incongruities which are always painful to us in those who arouse our sympathy .

		In fact , the incongruity is not con - fined to the Due de Reichstadt : it is so pain - fully apparent to each one of us when we think of ourselves and our own ideals , that it can not but have for us an absorbing interest .

		The idea being , therefore , something that absorbs our in - terest , and having this characteristic of strange unexplainableness about it , we call it tragic .

		So much for an idea of tragedy different from Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	's .

		Now for Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	, who will probably be remembered by many who have not
Pinero	PERSON	's plays at hand .

		She is not a tragic figure by reason of any conflict nor any unfulfilled mission .

		She is tragic for another reason .

		Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	was a woman who had come to a certain age and had got tired of her life .

		It had not been a happy one ; we may blame it or not , that is beside the immediate question : there comes a man who loves her and believes in her , and she conceives a future very different from the past and much happier , and the play begins .

		In the play she finds that she can not get rid of her past ; it comes up against her more and more insistently and unbearably , and she finally kills herself .

		What is the tragedy ?

		Merely this : that although we know that she could not have turned over a new leaf -LRB- gluing the old ones down -RRB- , we are not at all clear as to why she could not .

		It seems as if she should have had a chance .

		Why can not a woman like Paula Tanqueray wipe out the past and begin again ?

		First , because the particular kind of past that she had can not be wiped out , and second , because no past at all can be wiped out .

		But although we know this well enough we do not understand it , and so the particularly poignant or general cases make great tragedies .

		The
Due de Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	was a peculiarly poignant and general case of an incongruity of life , poignant because the character has an intense personality , and general because his case is the case -LRB- to some degree -RRB- of every idealist .

		Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	.

		on the other hand , was neither poignant nor general ; she was more the first than the second , but not truly either .

		So the play is not a great play , nor is any other play of
Pinero	PERSON	's great , for the same reason .

		Apply the test , however , to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's '' Ghosts '' : 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, you will find that Mrs.
Alving	PERSON	is a figure before which the imagination calms and quiets down and cools , so as to leave one in that state of mental insensibility that comes of pressing a question until we find there can be no possible answer to it .

		Or Sudermann 's '' Heimat . ''

		The play is not precisely a tragedy because no real evil befalls
Magda	PERSON	.

		But it is a tragedy as far as concerns her father , not because he is a poignant case , but because he is such a general one : he is the father who can not un - derstand his child , the burger who can not un - derstand the world outside the city wall , the man of the past who can not understand the present .

		Or
Hauptmann	PERSON	:
Hannele	PERSON	is a bet - ter instance than
Heinrich	PERSON	in `` The Sunken Bell '' ;
Hannele	PERSON	, for whom the world is too brutal and who dies in a fantastic reminiscence of past imaginings .

		Rostand we have already tested : Cyrano would have done as well as the
Due de Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cyrano is a perfectly general type , the person who does not get his due -LRB- i. e. , every one of us -RRB- , but he is also a personality .

		Maeterlinck I must leave out because it seems almost a piece of folly to speak of not understanding the action pre - sented in his plays .

		He surrounds his char - acters with such elements of mystery that it would be an exaggeration to say that we truly understood anything about them .

		That is why they are all ridiculous to some people , tragic to others .

		Mr.
Courtney	PERSON	, then , might have found mod - ern dramatists who illustrated the idea of tragedy better than
Pinero	PERSON	.

		It must be re - membered that he does speak of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and also that he delivered these lectures before the appearance of '' L'Aiglon . ''

		Also before Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	had translated '' La Citta Morte '' and before Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	had presented '' Herod . ''

		I have left myself too little space for these very interesting books .

		Of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's play , undoubtedly a powerful and emotional piece , it must be enough to confess that to its intoxi - cated , rarified , isolated atmosphere my criterion of the tragic has about as much relation as an ordinary foot-rule .

		In a certain way , perhaps , we might speak of it , but it would take too much explanation . ''

		Herod , '' on the other hand , offers a somewhat better illustration .

		Herod is a man of ambition and of action , a man quite able to deal easily with every com - bination of the involved politics of his time .

		He is definite and direct , perfectly self-confi - dent , perfectly adaptable to each new necessity , never unready , and therefore powerful .

		But he is in love with
Mariamne	PERSON	, and so much in love with her that she is more important to him than anything else .

		That in itself is a tragic situation and one that nobody can un - derstand .

		But in the case of
Herod	LOCATION	, the situa - tion is further intensified by his own misap - prehension .

		He is keen-sighted in politics but not with women .

		He does not seem clearly to understand whether he loves Mariamne better or his power ; he certainly does not rightly understand her .

		With his absolute self-confi - dence he can not see how a plan of his can go astray .

		Therefore he orders the death of
Mariamne	ORGANIZATION	's brother .

		Mariamne finds him out and hates him .

		He is tricked into ordering her death , and then he finds out how much he loved her .

		All this is presented in very beau - tiful classic verse and the effect is very strong .

		Incongruity , paradox , inconsistency , and yet such as we can not deny when we grant the facts at bottom , and so a tragedy .

		Whether a great tragedy or not will depend ultimately upon the breadth of the motive , the wideness of the general appeal .

		The play has the pre - serving power of style , but of course something more is needed for immortality .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		THE CHURCH ix THE PHILIPPINES .

		* It has been one of the greatest of misfor - tunes for both the
United States	LOCATION	and the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines that their relations should have drifted into the bubbling chaldron of American poli - tics , making misrepresentation the rule and not the exception , and rational knowledge and investigation a practical impossibility .

		But an equal misfortune is promised in the possi - bility of a sectarian aspect being given to the question through the attitude of the Filipinos toward the Friars of their islands and the atti - tude of the American government toward the
Friars	ORGANIZATION	.

		The question is a delicate and some - what complicated one , but its details are so little a matter of public knowledge that the recent books by Messrs.
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Robinson	PERSON	deserve especial attention from the light they throw on it and the excuse they give for dwelling on that phase of the general topic at this time .

		Mr.
Frederic H. Sawyer	PERSON	is an Englishman * THE INHABITANTS OF THE PHILIPPINES .

		By
Frederic H. Sawyer	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		THE PHILIPPINES : THE WAR AND THE PEOPLE .

Albert Q. Robinson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 resident in
Luzon	LOCATION	for the last fourteen years , and a traveller from time to time through the archipelago .

		He is in keen sympathy with the Americans in their general design of bringing the islands under their control , though sharply critical of the methods they have used up to this time .

		Mr.
Albert G. Robinson	PERSON	was the efficient correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' in the islands from
July , 1899	DATE	, to
February , 1900	DATE	, and his volume is made up for the most part of letters sent dur - ing that time to his paper , revised in the light of the latest information within his possession .

		To the seeker after truth both volumes are in - valuable ; to the partisan anxious only to con - ceal facts they will , it is to be feared , prove unwelcome , so certain is it that the taint of Europeanism and imperialism brings distrust of enlightenment .

		It has been pointed out before that the treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	, while it settled no question of human rights , devoted Articles VIII .

		and IX .

		to maintaining the property and other material rights of the religious orders in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	believes the Americans to have been imposed upon in $ is regard , and it is certain that the advice of Mr.
John Foreman	PERSON	concerning the matter was deliberately rejected . ''

		As soon as the effect of the treaty was known , '' Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	adds , ''
Archbishop Nozaleda	PERSON	, who had fled to
China	LOCATION	from the ven - geance he feared , returned to
Manila	LOCATION	.

		He seemed to have a good deal of interest with
General Otis	ORGANIZATION	, and this did not please the na - tives , nor inspire them with confidence . ''

		When it is realized that this prelate was held responsible by the Filipinos for the enormi - ties of the
1896	DATE	massacres , including the mar - tyrdom of
Jose Rizal	PERSON	, it is apparent that a mistake has been made from the point of view of everyone except the Friars , of whom the Archbishop , himself a Dominican , is the rep - resentative .

		For in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, as in
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, the natives , though devoted sons of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, are not pledged to any admi - ration for the Friars or the Spanish clergy generally .

		Their uniform ambition has been to have clergymen of their own race , secular priests , not religious .

		It is a matter of com - mon knowledge that the evils which run in the train of benefieed Friars were one of the prin - cipal causes of the Lutheran Reformation , and that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	recognized the justness of the universal complaints in the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	by forbidding
Friars	ORGANIZATION	to hold benefices .

		Un - fortunately the
Philippines	LOCATION	, like the
United States	LOCATION	, are in partibus infidelium , and in them the decrees of the
Tridentine Council	ORGANIZATION	do not run .

		The complaints of
Europe	LOCATION	in Luther 's time are the complaints of the Filipinos to-day .

		They are devoted to their native priests , and their revolt is not against the faith but the dis - cipline of the Church , nor are they open to criticism from Roman sources any more than those wise ecclesiastics who sought to do away with such abuses by forbidding Friars from benefices at
Trent	ORGANIZATION	in the sixteenth century .

		Against these abuses the Tagals arose again and again , laying down thousands of their lives to be free .

		Yet it is with the Friars that the American government has allied itself , and it is with them its army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	is acting at the present time , as its policy has been dictated by them since the occupation of
Manila	LOCATION	, par - ticularly since the return of Archbishop Noza - leda upon the signing of the treaty at which Filipino representation was forbidden .

		It is this that causes Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	to exclaim : '' More important still was it to take care that the Tagal insurrection should not have been in vain .

		That rebellion probably cost fifty thousand human lives , im - mense loss of property , and untold misery .

		It was fought against the Friars and was at last triumphant .

		The Spanish Friars had been expelled and their lands confiscated .

		Were the Americans to bring them back and guarantee them in peaceable possession , once more riveting on the chain the Tagals had torn off ?

		This seems to have been General
Otis	PERSON	's intention .

		I think he might have stood npon the accomplished fact .

		But he did not . ''

		-LRB- The italics are ours . -RRB-

		When Mr.
Sawyer	PERSON	comes to sum up the blunders of the
Peace Commission	ORGANIZATION	he sets them down as follows : `` 1 .

		They took
General Merritt	ORGANIZATION	's opinion that the Tagals would submit , and accepted Mr.
Foreman	PERSON	's assurance of Tagal plasticity and accommodating nature .

		`` 2 .

		They disregarded the intimation of
Don Felipe Agoncillo	PERSON	, the accredited agent of the Tagals , that these would accept no settlement to which they were not parties . ''

		3 .

		They treated several millions of civilized
Chris	PERSON	- tian people like a herd of cattle to be purchased with the ranch .

		`` 4 .

		Under Article VIII. , they guaranteed the re - ligious orders the possession of estates already taken from them .

		`` 5 .

		Under Article IX. , they gave the expelled friars the right to return and exercise their profession . ''

		Concerning the abuses of the
Friars	ORGANIZATION	, it will , perhaps , clear up the situation if the reader consult the pages of Mr.
John Foreman	PERSON	's book , remembering that Mr.
Foreman	PERSON	is himself a devout son of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, or such extracts from it as are given by Mr.
Herbert Welsh	PERSON	in his '' The Other Man 's Country '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, cott ,
1900	DATE	-RRB- , or in Mr.
Dean C. Worcester	PERSON	's '' The Philippine Islands '' -LRB- pp. 343 et seq * -RRB- .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	is not so explicit , but his meaning is not open to doubt when he says : '' I do not care to go into details concerning the charges of gross immorality , wrong , and oppression , that are brought against the Orders as organized bodies and against the members of the orders as individuals , from the archbishop -LSB- Nozaleda -RSB- downward .

		The charges are brought openly , and there can be no ques - tion that many of them are capable of the fullest sub - stantiation . ''

		He then enters into a consideration of the advent of the Most Reverend
Placide Louis Chapelle	PERSON	, archbishop of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, at once the apostolic delegate of His Holiness Pope
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		and the commissioner of President
McKinley	PERSON	.

		He arrived in
Manila	LOCATION	.

		A public reception in the nature of an official welcome was given him by Archbishop Nozaleda at which the American authorities , military and civil , were the principal attendants .

		Soon after
El Progreso	ORGANIZATION	, the newspaper leading the at - tack upon the
Friars	ORGANIZATION	, published an interview with him , never denied up to this time , in which Archbishop Chapelle was quoted as saying -LRB- the translation is Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's -RRB- : '' The four public lectures given by Father
McKin	PERSON	- non caused President
McKinley	PERSON	to realize the necessity for the monastic orders remaining in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		I come to
Manila	LOCATION	with ample authority for everything .

		The friars of
the Philippines	LOCATION	have alarmed themselves without any reason .

		I know their importance and am openly predisposed in their favor .

		If the friars occupy the parishes they will be considered as elements of order and therefore as American agents . ''

		That the Friars are in the saddle may be read in an authorized interview with Arch - bishop
Chappelle	PERSON	, published as a special dis - patch to the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune '' on
March 4 , 1901	DATE	, in which he is quoted as saying -LRB- the italics are ours -RRB- : '' First , I came here to reorganize Church affairs on American lines , and to place her in a position similar to the one she holds in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		`` Second , to accomplish this I will do my utmost to bring American priests here as soon as possible , and the friars will not oppose them .

		On the contrary , they will be pleased if a goodly number come , and they promise to do everything towards their maintenance and their instruc - tion in the character and needs of the Filipinos . ''

		It is , therefore , doubly certain that , since Archbishop
Chapelle	PERSON	's coming to the islands of the East the
Friars	ORGANIZATION	, returning in great num - bers from the surrounding countries to which the Filipinos had driven them , have been dic - tating the policy there of both church and state , of both
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		and
William McKinley	PERSON	.

		This is the more to be remarked , because this same prelate had previously been the apos - tolic delegate to
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, where all his influence had been used in favor of the insular as distinguished from the peninsular clergy , leaving those islands of the West fairly in the hands of their native secular priests and in the way of becoming fully so , with the Span - iards returning to
Europe	LOCATION	and freedom but - tressed by just that much the opposite in every particular of his procedure and its results in the unhappy
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		WALLACE RICE .

		THE EARLY POEMS OF
TENNYSON	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
John Churton Collins	PERSON	has recently ed - ited the early poems of Tennyson with the pur - pose of giving all their variant readings .

		He understands by the early poems , the editions of
1830	DATE	,
1833	DATE	,
1842	DATE	, the prize poem
Tim	PERSON	- buctoo , ''
1827	DATE	, and a few scattering pieces , one or two of which appeared as late as
1851	DATE	.

		Of his work he speaks in the Preface with charm - ing modesty : '' I must , I fear , claim the indulgence due to one who attempts , for the first time , a critical edition so per - plexingly voluminous in variants as
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		I can only say I have spared neither time nor labour to be accurate and exhaustive .

		... I am not conscious that I have left any variant unrecorded , but I should not like to assert that this is the case . ''

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is wrong -LRB- and this is a remark - able oversight -RRB- when he says that '' attempts for the first time '' as the
Cambridge Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL
December 16 , 1898	DATE	-RRB- was the pioneer in this field .

		The Bibliography is good , though by no means entirely correct or complete .

		As was pointed out in a com - munication to THE DIAL ,
May 16 , 1899	DATE	, no Tennyson bibliography yet published is free from errors and numerous omissions .

		As to the variants , the editor has done his work quite well .

		No one who has not com - pared texts with the purpose of noting every variation however trifling can have any idea how onerous the task is , and how many things provokingly remain unseen after one has looked long .

		While , however , the work has been done * THE EARLY POEMS OF

		Edited , with a critical Introduction , Commentaries , and Notes , together with the various readings , a Transcript of the Poems temporarily and finally suppressed , and a Bibliog - raphy , by

New York	LOCATION	: Q. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 well , it has not been done perfectly .

		I have noted about seventy-five errors , and it is not likely I have found them all .

		This is a small number , especially considering the fact , alluded to in the Preface , that a part of the work was done by assistants ; the wonder is that , under these circumstances , it is not very much larger .

		While these errors are for the most part very slight , none of them are failures to record variant spelling .

		Indeed , I am unable to see why variant spelling in a modern author should be recorded .

		I am well aware that a final e in Chaucer is important , but it seems to me quite insignificant whether Tennyson writes though or tho \ gray or grey , through or thro \ In these cases neither the meaning nor the rhythm nor the rhyme can be in any way affected .

		But for some reason Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's notes contain a host of variant spellings .

		The fact that he has culled so many might convey the impression that he has gathered them all or nearly all and that we have almost a facsimile of the early texts .

		This would be a wrong impression .

		While I have not counted the cases , I do not think he has given one-fifth of the orthograph - ical variants .

		But I still do not see why he should have taken the trouble to give any .

		Like most books this one has its limitations , but these should not blind us to our obligation to Mr.
Collins	PERSON	, for only after several such at - tempts as his can a definitive text of the poet be made .

		It is to be hoped that he will some time give us the variant readings of all
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's poems .


ALBERT E. JACK	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS . ''

		This is the first attempt made in any language , including Chinese , to produce a history of Chinese litera - ture . ''

		With this striking statement Professor Her - bert
A. Giles	PERSON	introduces his '' History of Chinese Literature '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , being the tenth Volume in the series of '' Literatures of the World . ''

		Criticism in the sense of correction or dissent is made dumb by such a fact as this ; we must place ourselves un - reservedly in the hands of the author , and trust implicitly in the accuracy of his scholarship .

		It is , however , permissible to express an opinion concern - ing the interest of his subject and of his book , and we may say without hesitation that both interests are great , the latter greater than we had supposed possible , and the former marked bv the admirable qualities of the author 's style .

		His manner of writing is such as to compel attention , being lucid , forceful , and penetrated with a shrewd wisdom that sometimes takes the form of a dry but delightful humor .

		What could be happier than this conclu - sion of the argument concerning the origin of the Chinese people ? ''

		No one seems to think they can possibly have originated in the fertile plains where they are now found . ''

		Or than this comment upon the fabled calendar trees ? ''

		But civilization proved unfavorable to their growth , and the species became extinct . ''

		One can not examine this treatise without a feeling of heightened respect for the people with whose writings it deals .

		Here is a literature that has an unbroken record of twenty-five centuries ; here is a civilization that for at least as long a period has known the uses of such things as silk garments , leather shoes , pottery , and umbrellas .

		These facts belong to a strictly historical chronol - ogy , but we are further reminded that the Chinese themselves pretend to account for the world for much longer than that to be exact , for the space of 2,269,381 years .

		How pitifully young and raw our Western civilizations and histories must appear when contrasted , not merely with the claims , but with the undisputed facts of Chinese history and civilization .

		Since Mr.
Giles	PERSON	has worked in virgin soil , as far as Western readers and critics are con - cerned , he has done well to depart from the plan of the series for which his book was written , by giving a large proportion of his pages to extracts from the Chinese classics .

		His translations of these passages are so charming that his book is at once a history and a florilegium , and in the latter aspect , as delightful a book as is often seen .

		There are two kinds of anthologies , which may be called subjective and objective .

		In the first kind , the compiler chiefly consults his own tastes and inter - ests , and leaves unconsidered the important ques - tion of how far his tastes and interests coincide with those which characterize the enlightened judg - ment of the race .

		In the other kind , the compiler has regard to tradition and authority , is careful of his perspective , and subordinates his personal incli - nations to the collective verdict of cumulative criti - cism .

		For English poetry , Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	's '' Golden Treasury '' is the perfect bouquet of anthological effort , although in this case , so admirable was the taste of the editor , there seems to have been slight need of any subordination of personal preference to the consensus of critical opinion .

		Of anthologies on a larger scale , the two of Mr. S ted man are prob - ably the best that have been made , although their restriction to the verse of a single century and that the latest has rendered certainty of judg - ment exceedingly difficult .

		Mr.
A. T. Quiller	PERSON	-
Couch	PERSON	is the latest of English anthologists , and the `` Oxford Book of English Verse , 1250-1900 '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as edited by him , gives us upwards of a thousand pages of the best of our poetry .

		Let it be said , however , once for all , that this is one of the subjective anthologies .

		The editor has put in the things that he likes , and that is the 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, whole story .

		His preface is an implied confession of this method , and goes on to tell us in explicit terms how he has modified his spellings , chosen the readings that he prefers over those which have the best authority , and even excised from famous poems the stanzas that do not appeal to his personal sym - pathies .

		All this being admitted , there is little to say , for nothing is more futile than to criticize an anthology compiled upon such a plan .

		The proper perspective is lacking , the choice is often capricious , and even the texts are not free from rather glaring mistakes .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	is an excellent novel - ist and a charming writer in other departments of literature , but he has never given evidence of criti - cal acumen , and his browsings in this field have always been those of an impressionist .

		An '' Ox - ford '' anthology ought to speak with a voice of special authority , but the voice of this book is one of which no intelligent reader need take much heed .

		It is a book of good poetry ; but there are thousands of readers who could have compiled books equally good , and probably scores who could have done better .

		A critic as dramatist .

		A commonplace of current criticism is the difference between the creative faculty and the critical .

		One who had more or less to say on the subject ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, is himself a fair illustration of the differ - ence .

		His prose was his best work : his poetry , though of immense charm for many minds , was excellent largely because it recognized its own critical character .

		Of creative energy
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in his earlier days undoubtedly had a measure , but it was swallowed up in his critical intelligence .

		Something of the sort ,
Lowell	PERSON	used to think , was the case with himself .

		The reverse process is less usual .

		We do not often find one who has given his mind up to critical problems , develope strong creative power .

		There are cases , Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, for instance , where a man 's mind developes both faculties together .

		But when a man has been long devoted to thinking out a system of art or literature , he is rarely able at the end of it to display powerful creative force .

		Thus
Ruskin	PERSON	, although he had something of an artist 's education , never developed the artist 's power .

		The critical habit seems to limit and constrain .

		All this is apropos to Mr.
G. L. Raymond	PERSON	's '' The Aztec God and Other Dramas '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Professor
Raymond	PERSON	is already well-known by a series of vol - umes presenting an extensive and careful theory of artistic effort and result .

		His mind has long been occupied in weighing and considering causes and effects , in the effort to discern the true generaliza - tion lurking in myriads of facts .

		Now with plenty of ideas , he turns to the drama , but here his mind refuses to embody his thought in forms quite dif - ferent from those which have been familiar to it .

		His thought , unconsciously to himself doubtless , takes some of the conventional forms which are , in a way , generalizations .

		Thus his dramas fail to have vitality , original strength .

		We must add to that , Mr.
Raymond	PERSON	does not seem to have the poet 's imagination .

		What he has to say he says rather plainly without the fulness and richness that we need to give us what we think of as poetic pleasure .

		Further we must say that he does not seem to us to have a clear idea of the possibilities of the dramatic form : the drama , if we recollect rightly , is the one form of art of which his system of aesthetics says little .

		At any rate , in an age familiar with Swin - burne and
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, or even
John Davidson	PERSON	and
Michael Field	PERSON	, his dramas lack the interest which comes of fresh , original effort given to the solution of old problems .

		An eccentric Professor
William Knight	PERSON	, of Glas - phiiosopher and
gow University	ORGANIZATION	, has collected in a his correspondence .

		come i y ?

		moderate-sized volume , en - titled ''
Lord Monboddo	PERSON	and Some of his Contem - poraries '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , the `` philosophical correspon - dence '' of this learned and eccentric Scotch judge with certain distinguished men of his time , with whom he was accustomed to discuss his then novel theories of language and the origin of man .

		Of the forty-seven letters to and from Lord Monboddo given in the volume only two have been previously published , and the collection is undoubtedly of con - siderable value in so far as it serves to illustrate the philosophical attitude of the writers and of reflec - tive men of their time generally toward the theories discussed .

		To the correspondence the editor has prefixed a brief biographical sketch of Lord Mon - boddo , together with a chapter on his philosophical position .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, it will be remembered , said to
Boswell	PERSON	during the famous Tour that he would gladly '' go two miles out of his way to see Lord Monboddo '' who was certainly worth the devia - tion , although the miles were Scotch ones .

		Lord
Monboddo	PERSON	's views , shocking to his contemporaries , as to man 's descent from caudate progenitors of the orang-outang order , do not seem so very eccen - tric nowadays .

		The letters in the present volume are elaborate , essay-like productions , such as nobody would think of writing nowadays .

		Among
Lord Monboddo	PERSON	's correspondents were
Dugald Stewart	PERSON	,
Samuel Horsley	PERSON	,
James Harris	PERSON	, Sir
William Jones	PERSON	, Sir
George Baker	PERSON	.

		There are several portraits .

		- that the much-discussed `` An `` Englishwoman 's Englishwoman 's Love-Letters '' Love-Letier * . ''

		-LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are known to be fiction , the book can be read and criticised without the wear - isome speculation which has grown around it .

		Were the letters really written by a woman ?

		How could such intimate letters have been published ?

		What could possibly have been the reason the affair was broken off ?

		Such questions were entirely aside from the literary aspects of the matter , and may now be forgotten .

		We know that the book is a piece of fiction .

		We know that it is needless to know why the affair was broken off .

		The book now aside from the truly pathetic character of
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 its last part is chiefly of interest to us as a good example of that preoccupation with the processes of the soul that distinguished the latter part of the nineteenth century .

		One can hardly do more to appreciate the literary position of the hook than to think how Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	would have been out - raged by it .

		Scott never , so far as we remember , dealt with any such case ; he would probably never have invented such a brutal story .

		But the case of the '' Bride of Lammermoor '' is something of a parallel so far as fulness of joy and fulness of misery are concerned .

		Scott told the story , but he never sought to examine
Lucy Ashton	PERSON	's heart .

		Examination of the human heart , however , is a thing that the present day rather enjoys .

		And the chief interest in this book is that it enables us to follow almost from day to day the rise of joy in a. woman 's breast , and its general turning to absolute misery .

		Such was the case with many readers who imagined the letters to be genuine ; such is the case when we read it as fiction .

		Its interest is in the painful tracing of heart-failure .

		For our own part this seems to us not a very excellent amusement .

		We should prefer , along with the heart-failure , some of the wider relations of life , some of the matters which would constitute something more of a balance according to the usual course of existence .

		Here probably is the value , such as it is , of the discussion of the reasons for it all .

		With some reasons the book gains in dignity ; with others it rather falls .

		It was perhaps wise for the author to leave us in the dark .

		The layman in biblical study has for the * future .

		shown slight interest in Messianic prophecy .

		This has been due -LRB- 1 -RRB- to the general obscurity of the subject and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to the lack of any adequate popular discussion of the theme .

		Professor
G. S. Goodspeed	PERSON	's ''
Israel	LOCATION	's Messianic Hope : ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is intended to dis - sipate both of these difficulties .

		It is intended primarily for the reader of the English Bible .

		For this reason technical questions in criticism and ex - egesis and Hebrew and Greek words are avoided .

		But not to neglect the advanced student , the author has provided liberal references to the best new lit - erature on the subject , and has added to the volume a selected bibliography .

		Now the method of Pro- fessor
Goodspeed	ORGANIZATION	is just that which will appeal to the popular reader .

		He has adopted , in preference to the so-called '' fulfilment '' or '' theological '' method , the historical plan of treatment .

		That is , he '' takes up the ancient Hebrew literature from the point of view of the historical origin and en - vironment of its various writings .

		The history is studied from the Hebrew side ; the ideas are inves - tigated as they grow out of the history , and are modified or conditioned by it .

		The question asked is , not so much , What did this statement mean to the Christian Church ?

		but , What did it mean to him who first uttered it , and to those by whom it was first heard or read ? ''

		This method can not but commend itself to every student of history .

		Its application to the treatment of this difficult subject is both sane and commendable .

		The author has quoted in the language of the Revised Version large portions of the text of the prophecies termed Mes - sianic , and has added thereto his luminous inter - pretation of the same .

		The discriminating scholar - ship , the fitting proportions , and the sanity of interpretation give this book a prominent place among the works on biblical theology .

		Popular interest in mushrooms , for muthwrm book .

		Dotn scientific and practical reasons , has grown considerably of recent years , and the latest contribution to the literature of this subject will be sure to find a receptive audi - ence .

		Miss
Nina L. Marshall	PERSON	is the author of `` The Mushroom Book '' now before us , which is published by
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their nature study series , which already contains books on butterflies , birds , and flowers .

		The special feature of all these books is that , although they are richly illustrated , they are sold at a very moderate price .

		The colored plates alone , twenty-four in number , would justify the price set upon the book , to say nothing of the numerous plates in black-and - white , the still more numerous cuts in the text , and the text itself .

		The book may be recommended as a safe guide for the identification of species by amateurs who have only a smattering of botanical method .

		The descriptions are accurate , and not more technical than is absolutely necessary .

		There are also directions for collecting and preserving specimens , and for cooking them as well which consideration will perhaps go farther than any other toward finding purchasers for the volume .

		It offers what is practically an equivalent of
Hamilton Gib	ORGANIZATION	- son 's work for a small fraction of its price .

		We need say no more than this to lovers of mushrooms , whether as articles of food or as objects of scientific study .

		Two volumes come together in the tooroiume .

		** Mediaeval Towns '' series -LRB- Dent - Oiffn I 'm fnn 111 ii .

		.

		.

		Macmillan -RRB- , one dealing with
Flor	PERSON	- ence and one with
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		Tho former is done with loving care by Mr.
Edmund G. Gardner	PERSON	, who combines the various artistic forces of the
Florentine Republic	ORGANIZATION	in his pages in such a way as to give it a really fine literary flavor .

		All the glories of poetry , painting , sculpture , and architec - ture that made the city splendid to the eye and ear and understanding speak again through his pages , an achievement by no means unique , the city hav - ing the gift of inspiring its modern chroniclers to an unusual degree .

		The history of this flower of the renaissance before the day of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is dismissed in a single chapter , and the story of the government carried down to the great Duke Cosimo .

		This , with a consideration of the Florentine people , suffices for the more formal history , the other portions of the book taking up the geographical divisions of
Florence	LOCATION	, and combining all their interests in a nar - 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, rative which serves as a guide-book through its par - ticularity , and as an account for instruction and amusement as well .

		A number of pictures from the hand of Miss
Nellie Erichsen	PERSON	are included , and with these are several reproductions of old engrav - ings of the town and its distinctive features .

		The work on
Constantinople	ORGANIZATION	has been done by the Rev.
William Holden Hutton	PERSON	, and its interest is made classic in a degree .

		Though not so large a book as the other , it covers more space , the opening chapter alone carrying the story from old Byzantium to the Turks .

		In the subsequent divisions of the book , dealing , as in the former case , with geographical portions of the ancient seat of empire , the interest is divided between the Christian and Moslem relics , with a natural leaning toward the older Greek rather than the newer Turk , the churches rather than the mosques .

		A final chapter deals with the pre-Christian life of the city as shown in architec - tural and other relics , and is by no means tbe least readable of the seven .

		Not a romance , though a tenuous love 8toi 7 ris .

		es almost to the surface now and again through the book , not a novel , though there are developments which al - most make it one in successive pages , Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's '' Dr. North and His Friends '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is none the less interesting because it is diffi - cult of classification .

		In its book form it is con - siderably larger than in its appearance as a serial , and the increase in size is due mainly to the inser - tion of a number of anecdotes of men and things , which have all the charm of an acquaintance with the people of whom they speak .

		It may be sur - mised , reasonably enough , that they are the very cream of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's common - place book .

		Taken as a whole the story outlines the life of such Americans as all of us would like to be , did culti - vation and wealth admit of it , and the pleasant company certainly sets a social ideal to which it would be well for Americans to conform .

		Yet it is with something of a shock that the reader comes to realize at the close of the narrative that a com - plete vulgarian has fairly forced the doors of this gentle and cultured society , all his too evident limi - tations , moral and social , being pardoned him in view of his great wealth , ill-gotten though it is .

		That Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	is well within the truth in giving such an ending to such an episode does not make it any better reading , and we wish he had contrived to maintain its own ideals throughout the book .

		Religion in the
Jorecattle	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	, for literalness the best sea writer since
Dana	PERSON	, is industriously making hay while the sun of his popularity shines .

		He now adds to the growing series of volumes reflecting the incidents of his seafaring career , a little book entitled '' With Christ at Sea '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , and defined as '' a personal record of religious experiences on board ship for fifteen years . ''

		An account of religion in the fo ` c 's ` le might , one would think , be almost as brief as the famous chapter on snakes in
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		But on Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's showing it seems clear that the name of his Maker is not used by '' poor
Jack	PERSON	'' solely as a profane expletive and to the sorrow of the traditi - onal '' cherub who sits up aloft '' and '' looks out for '' his ghostly interests .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	writes simply and earnestly , and his account of the artless piety of some of his erstwhile shipmates , and of their efforts to stem the tide of brutality , profanity , and debauchery by which the sailorman is commonly swept to moral and physical destruction , is touch - ing and interesting .

		The sailor , for all his outer roughness , and proneness to coarse indulgence , is commonly an emotional man , easily touched by fervent appeal , and far more open than the sophis - ticated landsman , to the methods of revivalism .

		That these methods make for good , and even per - manent good , in many cases , and are in fact the only methods by which the religious sense of large classes of men can be stirred , is certain .

		That a most promising and relatively neglected field for their trial is offered in every seaport town seems to us the practical moral of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book .

		We are not going to impugn the conduct or the wisdom of the battalions of Christian missionaries who go abroad annually with the view of persuading men to change their religions ; but we do think a larger proportion of them might well halt at the seaboard in the interests of men , nominally
Chris	PERSON	- , tian , who have in fact no religion at all .

		Mr.
Bul	PERSON	- len 's book is graphic and well-written , and shows an unfamiliar side of seafaring life and character .

		Where Miss
Maud Maryon	PERSON	's '' How An enjoyable book the Garden Grew '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- on the garden .

		diners from the dozen other recent garden books is in the gentle horticulturist 's begin - ning her narrative with no knowledge whatever of what should or should not be done with plants in order to induce them to grow out of doors .

		She thus '' starts even , '' as the boys say , with most of her readers , and they are enabled thereby to follow her to the end without losing sight of the garden .

		A little love story runs through the four chapters , which , beginning with winter , bear the names of the seasons , and there is an old English peasant named
Griggs	PERSON	who makes the American doubly grateful for the lack of such human cattle over here .

		Several well-drawn illustrations make the volume more desirable ; but it is to be read for en - joyment rather than instruction on this side of the great water . ''

		The Oresteia of ^ Eschylus , '' trans - lated and explained by Professor
George C. W. Warr	PERSON	, is the first of a series of four volumes which are designed to inter - est cultivated persons who can not read the originals in the masterpieces of fhe classical drama .

		Thus we have , not only a translation of the great trilogy , but in addition an extensive commentary , intro - A critical trantlalion of jEschylus .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 ductory essays on '' The Rise of Greek Tragedy '' and '' The Orestean Trilogy , '' and a series of illus - trations reproducing ancient frescoes , reliefs , and vase-paintings .

		The translation is a mixture of verse and prose verse for the dialogue , and prose for the lyrical passages .

		An appendix gives some metrical versions from the choruses .

		The trans - lator 's aim has been to steer a middle course be - tween the insipidity of Plnmptre and the uncouth literality of
Browning	PERSON	.

		His text is not exactly easy reading , but it is no more difficult than it must be , if anything of the JEschylean spirit is to be pre - served .

		We have received this work in two editions , one from Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, and the other from Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who supply the trade in this country .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Six volumes have now appeared iu the ''
Warwick Library	PERSON	, '' each devoted to the illustration of some par - ticular literary form in the history of English letters .

		Mr.
Oliphant Smeatou	PERSON	's '' English Satires '' -LRB- Imported by Scribner -RRB- is the new volume of this series , and sup - plies examples all the way from the author of '' Piers Plowman '' down to
C. S. C	ORGANIZATION	.

		The introduction , as is customary in this collection of volumes , is an elaborate essay upon the history of the form under consideration , and sets forth the gradual declination of the satirical species from its Roman position as one of the cardinal divisions of literary composition to the modern view which holds it to be rather a '' quality of style '' than one of the prime forms of expression .

		We have been reading a good deal about
Milton	PERSON	of late years .

		Besides the volumes in the various series , we have had Professor
Corson	PERSON	's learned disquisitions , and Professor
Trent	PERSON	's eloquent critical tribute , and now we have also Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	's '' Milton '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	always writes with distinction , and is at the same time one of the sanest and most finely-tempered of our living critics .

		His book is an elaborate essay upon the life of
Milton	LOCATION	, his circum - stances , his intellectual equipment , the technique and machinery of his writings , and his influence upon pos - terity .

		It can not be a work of supererogation to pro- duce as good a book as this upon
Milton	PERSON	or any other subject , and we are glad to add it to our collection of critical monographs .

		The third volume of the translation of Blok 's '' His - tory of the People of the Netherlands '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- covers the period of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	from
1559	DATE	to
1621	DATE	, comprising all of Volume III .

		and one-half of Volume IV .

		of the original .

		The book leaves evidence of the same scholarly treatment which characterized the preceding volumes , and by its numerous footnotes , and appended bibliography , attests the extended research of its author .

		The period is a favorite one for histo - rians , and one for which polemics are proverbial , but Mr.
Blok	PERSON	has carefully avoided such writing .

		In this volume there is a greater fulness of political conditions , as compared with social or economic development , than in the previous volumes , but this is justified by the politi - cal importance of the epoch , and in no way sacrifices the essential feature , the history of the growth of the people , to which the author pledged himself in the first volume .

		OF SPRING BOOKS .

		THE DIAL takes pleasure in presenting herewith its annual list of books announced for
Spring	DATE	publication , containing this year more than 750 titles .

		With a few necessary exceptions , books recently issued which have been already entered in our regular List of New Books are not named in the present list ; and all the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		The list is compiled from authentic data supplied for this purpose by the publishers themselves , and it is believed presents an accurate survey of the

March	DATE	A JOURNEY TO NATURE By
J. P. MOWBRAY	PERSON	THIS delightful volume by ''
J. P. M. ''	PERSON	is one of the few new books which the reader would not part with after finishing .

		Seldom it is that one finds a more ` charming story than this - telling of a Wall Street broker , who , under doctor 's orders , leaves all work and goes with his son far into the country to `` recuperate . '' ''

		During the first week of my voluntary exile I had to contemplate my eight-year-old son and heir with deadly concentration of purpose in order to understand that sudden death was not altogether preferable to slow extinction in utter solitude ... He never bent a single natural impulse to accommodate me .

		I was to bend all my case-hardened habits to accommodate him .

		He expected me to go to bed at eight o'clock and to get up at five .

		He had in his bones some kind of thermometrical arrangement with the sun ... When I told him that we were going to play
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	in the woods for a year , he complacently accepted it with the imme - diate arrangement that I was to be his man
Friday	DATE	. '' ''

		All that I could see of the night was a square , velvety black space where the window was .

		It was fretted by some dim , flying wings that microscopically glistened in the vagrant starlight , like tiny threads woven into the blackness .

		Out of this mystery of the dark crept all kinds of shadow sounds and occult breathings .

		I could hear the dog barks dying off in a vanishing perspective ... along the ground at regular intervals came the throb of a bass viol as some bull-frog twanged his string over at the mill-dam . ''

		THE DIAL 211 The Inn of the Silver Moon By
HERMAN K. VIELE	PERSON	.

		16mo , 31.25 .

		This book has sold only a few thousand copies , but the enthusiasm of those who have read it indicates that it may have almost as much distinction as the novels that '' are selling a thousand a day , '' and perhaps even as seductive a charm as though it were '' the book of the year . ''

		The story is the work of a new writer , submitted to the publishers through the mails , and issued because they liked it and believed others would like it .

		Not one reviewer has disagreed with this opinion , and many tired critics have found the tale as refreshing as
spring	DATE	water after a tramp .

		It must be a very deli - cate witchery that will rouse a hardened reviewer to the point of saying : '' It will not be cared for by more than one reader in ten , but to that one it will be a treasure from its first reading on and on forever . ''

		Perhaps it would be worth while to read the book on the chance of finding oneself the one in ten .

		Yet even to the other nine the hour given to the picturesque little romance will not be dull .

		Now that the public curiosity aroused by An Englishwoman 's Love Letters ' has been somewhat satiated , we should like to call attention to a work which is more deserving of the interest of that world that loves a lover .

		Some time ago
Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	published a book entitled ` The Love of an Uncrowned Queen , ' which for pure passion and genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest the fictitious and artificial ` letters ' said to be the work of Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	.

		Nothing could be more significant of the tyranny of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An English - woman 's Love Letters ' on the one hand and the utter lack of interest in The Love of an Uncrowned Queen ' on the other .

		12mo , cloth , 81.50 .

		This new volume includes '' The Devil 's Disciple , '' to which Mr.
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	has so gracefully and skillfully given vitality in this country , '' Csesar and Cleopatra , '' and '' Captain Brassbound 's Conver - sion . ''

		They make use of old device ?

		in a new way , and their puppets are men and women with natural motives and human inconsistencies .

		Yet they are plays that no one else could write , so original are they in outlook , so new and personal in their point of view .

		There is a breadth as of the prairies about them , and a freshness and vigor as of the wind in the woods .

		The distinction of his Csesar in '' Csesar and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra '' is an achievement .

		Shakespeare modeled the great commander in relief , a dignified and imposing figure .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	makes him human and approachable , yet behind his sympathy and tenderness one recog - nizes the conqueror .

PAUL CARUS	PERSON	into a brief and instructive story of the time of Christ , called '' The Crown of Thorns , '' which is to appear in the
April	DATE	'' Open Court . ''

		By omission rather than insertion , and by the presentation of facts of the historical milieu rather than fiction , the history of the estab - lishment and spread of the Christian religion is here vividly and di - rectly portrayed .

		Special illustrations for the story have been made by the talented artist , Mr.
Eduard Biedermann	PERSON	.

		The recovery during the
last century	DATE	of the long - lost story of the great Semitic civilizations which perished ere those of
Greece	LOCATION	and

		The reader of this history will find the Old Testament record illumined at various points , and luster shed on the figures of the prophets , especially
Isaiah	PERSON	and
Jeremiah	PERSON	.

		The Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment parallels to the history in hand are frankly treated .

Rogers	PERSON	holds that the Old Testament has been , on the whole , the gainer from Assyrian studies , while ' the apologetic value of monumental testimony has often been greatly exaggerated . ' ''

ALBERT HENKY NEWMAN	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. ,
Professor of Church History	ORGANIZATION	in
McMaster University	ORGANIZATION	,
Toronto	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, in a signed review covering something over two pages in the
January	DATE	issue of the American Journal of Theology -LRB- published by the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , referring to
WISHART	PERSON	'S `` A SHORT HISTORY OF MONKS AND MONASTERIES , '' says : `` It may be said at once that he has produced by far the best book on the subject in the English language , and that it would be hard to find in any language a better general discussion of the various ques - tions involved in the history of monasticism . ''

		FBANKLIN
JOHNSON	LOCATION	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL D. ,
Professor of Church History	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, says : `` The book presents by far the best survey of Monasticism with which I am acquainted , and it is the only one which even attempts to give a fair and dispassionate estimate of the system . ''


PAUL MONROE	PERSON	, Ph.D. ,
Professor of History of Education	ORGANIZATION	, Teachers ' College ,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	, says : '' ' Monks and Monasteries ' is one of the best brief works on the subject of which I know .

		The subject is treated in a clear and popular manner , and at the same time is scholarly and accurate .

		The treat - ment is the appreciative one necessary to get at the real heart of the subject ; and yet , with historical fairness , it sets forth the injurious as well as the beneficial influences resulting from the ascetic ideal and the monastic life .

		... It can be recommended unhesitatingly to both classes -LSB- students and the general public -RSB- of readers . ''

		The
New York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	says : '' Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	's theme is one which it is not easy to discuss without prejudice .

		In such a matter non-partisanship is almost an impossibility .

		To say , as one must , that his treatment of it is marked by unusual fair - ness and open-mindedness is , accordingly , to give him no small amount of praise .

		He is neither an assailant nor au apologist of monasticism , but seeks to understand it as an historical phenomenon , and to state without bias both the good and the evil that have flowed from it .

		... He writes in a clear and pleasing style , and his presentation of the facts is accurate and instructive . ''

		241 THE CASE AT
STANFORD	LOCATION	.

		When the controversy occasioned by the dismissal of Professor
Ross	PERSON	from
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	was still in its early stages , we ex - pressed a brief opinion to the effect that the principle of the freedom of teaching had suf - fered no injury at the hands of the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities .

		We intended to say nothing more about the matter , and , in now reverting to it , we have , in substance , nothing to do beyond reaffirming the belief at first formulated in these pages .

		Since that early writing , however , so many statements , of such conflicting tenor , have appeared in the public prints , and so many persons have joined in the controversy , that it seems desirable to deal with the question at a somewhat greater length than before .

		It need hardly be said , by way of prelimi - nary observation , that THE DIAL has always held the principle of Lehrfreiheit as one of the most sacred articles of its faith , and that it has championed that principle , upon more than one occasion , to the best of its ability .

		But it has also refused to assume the attitude of those extremists who consider the charge that
Lehr	PERSON	- freiheit has been attacked as prima .

		facie evi - dence that the attack has really been made , and with whom accusation is tantamount to conviction .

		Such questions are always delicate , calling for the most careful examination and the most scrupulous weighing of the evidence .

		When
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was made the .

		victim of an attack of this sort a few years ago , we happened to be in a position to know how absolutely groundless was the case against it , and how distorted a picture of such a situation might be drawn by sensational journalism , and impressed upon the minds even of sober and judicial observers .

		That incident gave us a lesson in caution by which we hope to profit in the present instance .

		The case against the
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	administration has been given its strongest statement , no doubt , in the report made by a committee of members of the
American Economic Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		The names of the men signatory to that statement must command respect for what they say , and entitle their argument to a careful consideration .

		And yet we are bound to say that their plea is in certain respects disingen - uous .

		It certainly gives to a casual reader the impression that it is made with the official sanction of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	to which the signers belong , whereas the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was in fact self - constituted , and represents only itself .

		Our suspicions are also aroused by the language of the report , in which it is darkly hinted that the most damaging facts in the possession of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	have not been included , but are 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, held in reserve for a possible future publication .

		It was clearly the duty of these gentlemen to state their case once for all as strongly as pos - sible ; as it is , their action is such as to lessen confidence in their findings .

		Again , it must be remembered that this Report is the result of an investigation at long range , made by means of correspondence only , and as such is liable to errors of judgment .

		Moreover , nearly all the controversialists who have rushed to join in the attack upon the
Western University are Eastern	ORGANIZATION	men who can not , in the nature of things , have that close acquaintance with the facts which is so essential to the assumption of a truly judicial attitude .

		Their judgment seems to be based either upon an unquestioning acceptance of the conclusions of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, or upon purely a priori reasoning .

		When they take such forms as the grave suggestion that a professorial trade union should be organized , and the officious warning that the ethics of the educational calling will be violated by the ac - ceptance of a chair in
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, they certainly do not commend themselves to the judicious .

		Turning now to the aspects of the case as they present themselves from the
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	point of view , we find more than enough to counterbalance the ex cathedra pronounce - ments of a wilderness of long range critics .

		We find , first of all , the report of the Com - mittee of Alumni appointed to make a special investigation of the matter , and this report is emphatic in its statement that freedom of teaching has not been attacked by the admin - istration .

		Reaching a conclusion diametrically opposite to that reached by the Eastern Com - mittee , the balance of judgment would , on the whole , appear to be in its favor .

		Against the greater experience and reputation of the
East	LOCATION	- ern men , the close familiarity of the Western men with all the facts of the situation may reasonably be urged as an offset , and the ques - tion of possible interestedness does not seem likely to have entered into the one report more than into the other .

		Moreover , the findings of this
Committee of Alumni	ORGANIZATION	are approved of by an overwhelming preponderance of student and faculty opinion .

		Such men as Professor
Anderson	PERSON	and Professor Fliigel , to name only two of those who have rallied to the defence of the administration , are not the sort of men to compromise with hypocrisy , or condone an of - fence against a principle which they hold sacred .

		Nor is that clear-headed and outspoken champion of all good and honest intellectual causes , Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, who has been in close touch with the situation all the time , likely to be deceived by any sort of pretence or disingenuous evasion of the facts .

		Finally , President
Jordan	PERSON	himself , who is the very em - bodiment of intellectual honesty and moral courage , has declared in unequivocal terms that the principle of freedom of teaching has been in no way involved in the recent occur - rences .

		The attempt to accuse him of palter - ing with words in a double sense has no more basis than a few casual remarks about the char - acter and ability of the person who has made all this disturbance , remarks evidently made out of pure kindness of heart , and now twisted into the evidence of double-dealing .

		The plain facts of the case seem to be that the instructor whose dismissal has raised all this pother is a young man who has never been able to rise to a sense of the dignity and re - sponsibility of his position .

		His defects of taste and of intellectual balance have long been understood and deplored by his associates , and at last his services have been dispensed with reluctantly , because of the outcry that is sure to be made in such a case , because also of regard for the reputation of the instructor himself .

		His position in the
University	ORGANIZATION	had always been probationary , and this fact is in itself almost sufficient to dispose of the whole controversy .

		Before a man has received a permanent appointment , the authorities of no institution are accountable to the public for their dealings with him .

		This distinction between permanent and probationary appoint - ments is of the utmost importance , but surpris - ingly little attention has been paid to it during the recent discussion .

		There must be a period during which a man 's character and capabilities are being tested , and while that period lasts , something like arbitrary action concerning him must be held legitimate .

		Upon no other con - dition than this can a strong university faculty be organized .

		After all , when serious people set themselves to discussing the principle of Lehrfreiheit , they are thinking of something very different from this tempest in a Stanford teapot .

		They are thinking of the deliberate attempts of ob - scurantist and reactionary authorities to stifle intellectual endeavor , and to impede the pro- gress of the great creative ideas that from time to time transform our modes of thought .

		They are thinking of such things as the occasional official efforts made in
Germany	LOCATION	during the last century to force all university teaching
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 into conformity with the ideas of the monarchy and the established church .

		They are thinking of such things as the effort , made so energet - ically in the generation just preceding our own , to deny a hearing to the doctrine of evolution , and to discourage its promulgation in the rec - ognized institutions of learning .

		They are thinking of all sorts of attempts to influence or cajole or threaten thinkers of achieved reputa - tion , in order that the fabric of conventional falsehood may not be undermined and totter to its
fall	DATE	.

		They are not thinking at all of the merely disciplinary questions that must arise in every university when dealing with the ec - centricities and the lapses from good taste or good judgment of its young men , on trial for advancement in their academic career .

		Let us remember all the while that the case at
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	is the case of young Professor
Ross	PERSON	, of whom few people would ever have heard had his grievances not been exploited by journal - ism , and who was never in permanent appoint - ment .

		It is not , for example , and by way of startling contrast , the case of Professor
Norton	PERSON	at
Harvard	LOCATION	, or of Professor Sumner at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, or of Professor von Hoist at
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Nor , we may add , is it the case of President
Jordan	PERSON	at
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	.

		All of these gentlemen have made public utterances during the past two or three years that must have been highly objectionable to the constituted authorities .

		But the suggestion that these men have imper - iled their positions by their boldness of speech is too preposterous for a moment 's considera - tion .

		It is when we try to imagine a case of this sort that we come fully to understand how securely the principle of Lehrfreiheit is guard - ed by the authorities of our great universities , and how certainly , should they once fail in their trust , would they be forced back into the path of duty by the overwhelming pressure of public opinion .

		A FURTHER WORD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of TH * DIAL . -RRB-

		In yonr issue of
January 16	DATE	, there appeared a com - munication regarding the opening of the
Brumback Library	ORGANIZATION	at Van Wert ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, from Mr.
E. I. Antrim	PERSON	, in which the following sentences occur : '' Most of the cities and many of the larger towns and villages of our country have their public libraries ; it remained for this
Ohio County	LOCATION	to inaugurate a movement that may eventually bring library privileges where they are most needed , namely , to the rural districts ... Under the stimulus already given ,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	has extended its field of library work to all parts of
Hamilton County	LOCATION	, and several other counties have been discussing the ad - visability of imitating the example of
Van Wert County	LOCATION	. ''

		In yonr issue of
March 16	DATE	, Mr.
A. L. Day	PERSON	takes ex - ception to Mr.
Antrim	PERSON	's statements , and with the greatest of respect for the officials of the Van Wert library , and the sincerest and heartiest appreciation of the noble gift of Mr.
Brumback	PERSON	, I wish to add a further word opposing the idea set forth in Mr.
Antrim	PERSON	's com - munication , and declared in the address of presentation on the occasion of the dedication , that the Van Wert library is the pioneer in the matter of furnishing '' library privileges to the rural districts . ''

		The law which made possible the acceptance of Mr.
Brnmback	PERSON	's gift of a library building for the county must here - after support the library was passed
April 26	DATE	, 1 898 .

		The agreement with the

		The late
A. W. Whelpley	PERSON	, for many years the Li - brarian of the Public Library of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, in his annual report for

Cincinnati	LOCATION	's great library be extended to the residents of
Hamilton County	LOCATION	the county within which Cin - cinnati is situate .

		On
April 21 , 1898	DATE	, an act was passed by the

Board of Education of the School	ORGANIZATION	district and placed in the bands of a
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	.

		Immediately upon the passage of the act , the resi - dents of

		THE GRAND OLD MAN OF
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		By the death of Mr.
Yukichi Fukuzawa	PERSON	,
Japan	LOCATION	has suffered the loss of one of its truly great men .

		From the fact that he lived in the
Mita District of Tokyo	LOCATION	, he was generally called the `` Sage of Mita '' ; but he was often called '' the grand old man of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		He was one of the early Japanese students of Dutch and En - glish .

		In
1858	DATE	he came from
Nagasaki	LOCATION	to Yedo , and opened a school which was the nucleus of the great in - stitution now known as the
Keiogijiku	LOCATION	, with academic , collegiate , and university courses .

		This school was not closed during the Revolutionary War ; even during the Battle of Nyeno -LRB- 1869 -RRB- , his school continued in session in another section of the city , and his students were studying
Wayland	LOCATION	's
Moral Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		From this school have gone forth hundreds of able young men who have distinguished themselves in all departments of life .

		As the
Japan	LOCATION	'' Times '' says , '' It was in this school and under the eye of its great master that the art of public speaking was first practiced ; in fact , the Japanese word for a public speech -LSB- oration -RSB- , now so generally used , was coined by Mr.
Fukuzawa	PERSON	himself .

		He may , indeed , be called a great educator , or teacher . ''

		In
1882	DATE	he established a daily paper called
Jiji Shimpo	PERSON	-LRB- '' News of the Times , '' or '' Times '' -RRB- , which holds in
Japan	LOCATION	the same prominent place that its name - sakes hold in
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		Although in certain points that paper may be surpassed by some contemporary , yet it is , on the whole , what it claims to be , '' the No. 1 daily of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		The editorials by Mr.
Fukuzawa	PERSON	could always be recognized by their simple , clear , and forcible style , and their instructive and ele - vating tone .

		In view of the influence of his journal , he may again be called a great educator , or editor .

		With reference to his style of writing , it should also be noted that he shares with Mr.
Fukuchi	PERSON	'' the honor of having introduced what may be called the natural style in Japanese literature as distinguished from the stilted Chinese style . ''

		He was a prolific writer : his total output is said to have been '' 50 different kinds of books , comprising 105 volumes . ''

		-LRB- It must , however , be understood that a Japanese '' volume '' is rather small . -RRB-

		His writings were principally on social , political , and moral topics , and have wielded a powerful influence in
Modern Japan	LOCATION	.

		For instance , he '' did more than anybody else to eman - cipate the fair sex from the restraints of the old - fashioned code of morality , by the publication of his Criticisms of
Kaibara	ORGANIZATION	's Great Learning for Women ' and his own ' New Great Learning for Women . ' ''

		From a third point of view , therefore , he may be called a great educator , or author .

		He might have been Minister of Education , or have received a patent of nobility ; but he refused public office and despised titles , except such as `` the great commoner , '' which was sometimes conferred upon him .

		His life was pure and blameless ; and his moral teach - ings were of the loftiest type .

		He practiced what he preached , so that he was once more a great educator , or exemplar .

		The
Japan	LOCATION	'' Mail '' says of him : '' As a leader of the new civilization , it would be difficult to over-rate the benefits conferred by him on his country . '' ''

		He is described as the great motive force of
Japan	LOCATION	's modern civilization ; the man who did more than all his con - temporaries to promote the spread of a spirit of true liberalism . ''

		Whether as teacher , editor , essayist , author , or mor - alist , Mr.
Fukuzawa	PERSON	deserves the highest rank among the '' men of letters of
New Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		THE MOTHER TONGUE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The efforts of THE DIAL towards improving the in - struction in English in the secondary schools and in the universities , have been highly appreciated by the lan - guage teachers of the country , and the agitation thus started has certainly been a stimulus in setting many a teacher to thinking and to acting .

		That the subject is one of the most important , if not the most serious , problems with which educators have to deal , no one will deny .

		Now and then there appears a case that seems utterly hopeless .

		At a recent examination in English for ad - mission into one of the universities , the candidates were asked , among other things , to write a sketch of some character from literature , no restriction being placed upon the choice .

		One young man , who had '' taken '' English three or more years in a high school , but evi - dently had not been able to retain it , produced an in - teresting essay ; it appears below verbatim and literatim , and with the original punctuation : `` Lord .

		Byron , was a briliant writer of prose , he was a cripple being crippled both being turned in he wor a long clok to conseal his feet , but never the less for all hia def or - maties he was a great swimer , he most alway swam alone , he could swim for hours befor becoming tired . ''

		This , then , represents not only all the young man can write about any character in literature , but also his sense of accuracy and of form .

		It is needless to say that the candidate was not ad - mitted ; he was sent back , with the blessing of the ex - amining committee , to take a few more doses , and , in all probability , will finally be declared incurable .

		Does the fault lie in the training and experience of the physician , or is the patient 's constitution , on account of neglect in early childhood , too weak to bear the heroic treatment that seems necessary ?

		THE DIAL 225 A JOURNALIST 'S REMINISCENCES .

		* There is an old story of an Irish butler who boasted that he was so skilled in his calling that he could put a quart of wine into a pint decanter ; and we have often wished that bio - graphers could be brought to emulate in their province this man 's powers of compression .

		We do not say this with the intention of cast - ing a special reflection on Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's two - volume autobiography now before us , but in reference to the curious fact that even men who in other walks of literature are honorably distinguished by a Spartan continence of speech are apt to throw moderation to the winds and go on forever , like
Tennyson	PERSON	's brook or Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	the philosopher , the moment they begin writing biography .

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's autobiography was begun at the instance of the late Mr.
Houghton	PERSON	, the publisher , and notwithstanding its occasional diffuseness it bears out the opinion of its prob - able value of that excellent judge of men and books .

		The story of the author 's own doings is worth telling , and had Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	left un - recorded his memories and impressions of the many interesting people he has foregathered with during his somewhat roving and desultory career as painter and journalist it would have been a real loss to the public .

		In his opening chapters Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	gives an account of his home life during boyhood , which is an altogether capital picture of
Puri	PERSON	- tan family life , abounding in vivid touches of characterization , and conveying an adequate idea of the spirit and tendencies , for evil as for good , of
New England Puritanism	ORGANIZATION	in its archaic severity .

		After reading this most interesting , if in its details at times somewhat repellant and painful , section of the book one can only wonder how the warm humanity and genial bohemianism of the author 's manhood could have germinated in so frosty an atmosphere .

		The somewhat prolix chapters dealing with Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's school days and his three years ' stay at
Union College	ORGANIZATION	.


Schenectady	LOCATION	, are fol - lowed by a brief account of his art studies in
America	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, and at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It was with the opening of this period of art study that his rovings -LRB- we use the word in no dis - respectful or derogatory sense -RRB- began .

		In * THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OP A JOURNALIST .

		By
William J. Stillman	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With portraits .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1849 Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	went to
England	LOCATION	to see
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's pictures , and at
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's gallery in
London	LOCATION	he had the good fortune to see not only the eccentric painter himself , but his elo - quent champion , Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	.


Griffiths	PERSON	, a kindly , honest man for an art-dealer , had been touched by the young stranger 's enthusiasm , and introduced him one day to
Turner	PERSON	as a young artist who had a great admiration for his work , and would be glad to take him by the hand .

		The response , if not cordial , was at least Turneresque .

		Says Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	: '' It was difficult to reconcile my conception of the great artist with this little , and , to casual observation , insignificant old man with a nose like an eagle 's beak , though a second sight showed that his eye , too , was like an eagle 's , bright , penetrating , and restless .

		Half awed and half surprised , I held out my hand .

		He put his behind him , regarding me with a humorous , malicious look , saying nothing .

		Confused , and not a little mor - tified , I turned away , and , walking down the gallery , went to studying the pictures again .

		When I looked his way again he held out his hand to me ... He gave me a hearty hand-shake , and in his oracular way said , ' Hmph -LRB- nod -RRB- if you come to
England	LOCATION	again hmph -LRB- nod -RRB- hmph -LRB- nod -RRB- , ' and another hand-shake with more cordiality and a nod for good-by .

		I never saw a keener eye than his , and the way he held himself np , so straight that he seemed almost to lean backwards , with his forehead thrown forward , and the piercing eyes looking out from under their heavy brows , and his diminutive stature coupled with the imposing bearing , combined to make a very vivid impression on me . ''

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	recalls that
Turner	PERSON	said of his own pictures in the course of the interview , '' I wish they were all put in a blunderbuss and shot off ! ''

		but , he adds , '' he looked pleased at the simultaneous outburst of protest on the part , of
Griffiths	PERSON	and myself . ''

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's account of his early ventures in journalism , in `` spiritism , '' in political con - spiracy -LRB- he became associated with Kossuth in
1852	DATE	and went to
Europe	LOCATION	on a secret mission for him -RRB- , in '' roughing it '' in the Adirondack wilderness , is followed by the charming episode of the '' Adirondack Club '' one of the richest chapters in the book .

		The Club was the out - come of Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's enthusiastic stories of his camping experiences .

		Its members were
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Howe	PERSON	, Professor Wy - man , Judge
Hoar	PERSON	, Dr.
Binney	PERSON	,
John Holmes	PERSON	,
Horatio Woodman	PERSON	, and the author .

		Longfellow was asked to be of the party , but he declined on learning that
Emerson	PERSON	had bought a gun . ''

		Is it true that
Emerson	PERSON	is going to take a gun ? '

		he asked me ; and when I said that he had finally de - cided to do so , he ejaculated , ' Then somebody will be shot ! '

		and would talk no more of going . ''

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	also was asked to join ; but the 226 -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Autocrat had little sympathy with woods and savagery , and was loath to leave his beloved
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Says Mr.
Stillmau	PERSON	: '' He loved his
Cambridge	LOCATION	friends serenely ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wyman	PERSON	, I think , above others ; but he en - joyed himself most of all , and
Boston	LOCATION	more than anything on earth .

		He was lifted above ennui and discontent by a most happy satisfaction with the rounded world of his own individuality and belongings .

		Of the three men whom I have personally known in the world who seemed most satisfied with what fate and fortune had made them , namely ,
Gladstone	LOCATION	, Professor
Freeman	PERSON	, and
Holmes	PERSON	, I think
Holmes	PERSON	enjoyed himself the most . ''

		At Saranac , en route to the camping-place , an amusing incident occurred .

		Rumor had spread the report of the impending advent of the distinguished party of '' campers , '' and the selectmen of the town had appointed a com - mittee to receive them .

		The community was on the qui vive to see , not
Emerson	PERSON	or
Lowell	LOCATION	, but Agassiz the man who preferred life in
America	LOCATION	to the senatorship and the keepership of the Jardin des Plantes offered him by the Emperor of the French .

		The heart of democ - racy was touched , and Saranac turned out in force to meet the plain man who had slighted the advances of an Emperor . ''

		A reception was accorded , and they -LRB- the commit - tee -RRB- came , having taken care to provide themselves with an engraved portrait of the scientist , to guard against a personation and a waste of their respects .

		The head of the deputation , after having carefully com - pared Agassiz to the engraving , turned gravely to his followers and said , Yes , it 's him ' ; and they proceeded with the same gravity to shake hands in their order , ignoring all other luminaries . ''

		It is not recorded that
Emerson	PERSON	used the gun , the purchase of which had paused Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	's doleful prediction .

		His '' hunt - ing '' seems to have been in the main emblemat - ical , like the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	's yearly plough - ing .

		But on one occasion he developed a trace of the primitive longing to `` kill something . '' ''

		One
Sunday	DATE
morning	TIME	, when all the others went out for the drive of the deer ,
Emerson	PERSON	asked me to take him out on the lake to some quiet place for meditation .

		We landed in a deep bay , where the seclusion was most complete , and he went into the woods to meditate .

		Presently we heard the baying of the hound as he circled round the lake , on the hillsides , for the deer were reluctant at that season to take to the water , and gave a long chase ; and , as he listened , he began to take in the excitement of the hunters , and finally broke out abruptly , '' Let us go after the deer ' ; and down the lake we went , flying at our best , but we arrived too late ,
Lowell	PERSON	had killed the deer .

		He said to me later , and emphatically , ' I must kill a deer ' ; and one night we went out ` jack-hunting ' to enable him to realize that ambition . ''

		The `` jack-hunting , '' however , came to naught , so far as
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's ambition was con - cerned , for , although three deer were sighted successively in easy range , the philosopher seems to have had as many attacks of that acute paralysis of the faculties known to hunters as '' buck fever '' though Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	kindly ascribes the failure to pull trigger to inability to see the game .

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	was consul at
Rome	LOCATION	in the early sixties , and his chapter on his experiences there deals very frankly with the then moral and political condition of the papal city , which seems to have been unspeakably bad .

		Brig - andage was rife , and common morality , even among the native clergy , was rare .

		When urged by the French authorities to license and regulate the disreputable houses ,
Pius IX	PERSON	.

		re - plied that '' every house was a brothel , and it was useless to license any . ''

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	quotes , with thinly veiled approval , a popular saying that '' if you wanted to go to a brothel you must go in the daytime , for at night they were full of priests '' ; but he adds , '' Let me not be charged with making of this state of things an accusation against the Catholic re - ligion . ''

		Roman misrule was due to priestly inexperience in and official incapacity for civil administration ; and the situation was made worse by the '' Italian constitutional indiffer - ence to questions of common morality . ''

		As to
Pius IX.	PERSON	, Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	found him not only a devout man , but '' an excellent and admirable one , '' a profound believer in the divine warrant and direction of his pontificate , but incapaci - tated for civil rule simply because it could not be carried out on ecclesiastical principles .

		Cardinal
Antonelli	PERSON	, the real ruler of the Papal States , Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	roundly describes as the '' very impersonation of unscrupulous and malignant intellect , subtle with all the Italian subtlety , and unscrupulous as any of the brigands from the community in which he had his origin . '' ''

		Antonelli had a face which gave one an idea of the expression ' beaute * du Diable , ' for a more perfect type of Satanic intelligence and malignity than it showed at times I can not conceive .

		If I had been a figure painter , I should certainly have painted him as Mephistopbeles , as he appeared in the audience room in his close-fitting purple costume with scarlet trimmings , his long coat - tails flying behind him when he moved , like the fringe of a flame . ''

		One is not a little surprised to find Mr.
Still	PERSON	- man describing
Charlotte Cushman	PERSON	, then a member of the American colony at
Rome	LOCATION	, as a sort of spiritual counterpart of the Mephisto - phelian Antonelli . ''

		I think she possessed an utterly selfish nature , was
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 not at all scrupulous in the attainment of her purposes , and was , in effect , that most dangerous member of society , a strong-willed and large-brained woman with - out a vestige of principle ... She was an immense illustration of a maxim of
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	to the effect that artists bad nothing to do with morality . ''

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	goes on to hint darkly at certain '' terrible '' stories told of the actress by an artist who , when a scene-painter , had known her in
New York	LOCATION	, and which he cautioned Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	not to repeat , since if they got to Miss
Cushman	PERSON	's ears '' she was quite capable of silencing him -LRB- the relator -RRB- in the most ef - fective manner '' ; and , adds the author seri - ously , '' I am of opinion that he judged her correctly , for she must have been a tiger when her passions were roused . ''

		This seems really too bad of Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	.

		The gifted
Charlotte	LOCATION	was perhaps a woman of imperious temper , and by no means a
Griselda	LOCATION	in point of patience under provocation ; but that she was capable of resorting to the stiletto or the bowl , save as stage properties and in the professional way , we are by no means inclined to believe .

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's second volume is devoted mainly to his consular experiences in
Crete	LOCATION	, and his adventures in the Balkan countries and the
Levant	ORGANIZATION	generally as foreign correspon - dent of the '' Times '' and other newspapers .

		Light is shed on
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	questions , and Greek and Italian politics and politicians are inter - estingly discussed .

		An amusing chapter is interpolated on
Rossetti	PERSON	and his circle .

		All in all , Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	has given us a very enter - taining book , rich in reminiscences of authors and artists , and by no means devoid of charm of style and critical value .

		The volumes are inviting outwardly neat , substantial , and well printed .

		THE STORT OF FRANGIPANI 'S RING .

		* The monograph entitled '' Frangipani 's Ring , '' by Dr.
Henry Thode	PERSON	, the celebrated aesthetic philosopher and historian , was origin - ally published in
London	LOCATION	by
John Macqueen	PERSON	, in
1894	DATE	, just as its author was leaving
Venice	LOCATION	, after a residence of several years , to accept the chair of History of Art in
Heidelberg Univer	LOCATION	- sity .

		For any other man the solution of the problem which the book involves would have been a labor of years .

		To Dr.
Thode	PERSON	it meant only a few days ' casual search through the RING : An Episode in the
Life of Henry Thode	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated by
J. F. C. L. Illustrated	ORGANIZATION	.

		Philadel - phia :
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		manuscripts in
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	's , together with a few days more spent in other famous libraries and devoted to verification and elaboration of his results ; and finally a gratuitous visit to the little village church whose altar-piece forms the theme of the concluding chapter .

		But back of these rapid , almost intuitive , deductions , and rendering them intelligible , must be understood a life-time of research into the history and the art of mediaeval
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In these days of books for the many , '' Fran - gipani 's King '' is of course emphatically a book for the few .

		Yet its public should not be lim - ited to the antiquary , familiar with Dr.
Thode	PERSON	's more profound works and duly appreciative , as the layman can not but fail to be , of the erudite industry and nicety of deduction which the elaboration of this little episode displays .

		No less genuine , if less esoteric , pleasure is in store here for the reader to whom
Jan Schorel	ORGANIZATION	is an empty name ,
Diirer	PERSON	none too suggestive of a definite method , and
Friuli	LOCATION	in
1513	DATE	as un - trodden country as
Hungary	LOCATION	ten years later .

		The casual reader , to be sure , would be certain to find Dr.
Thode	PERSON	's enthusiasm too aggressive , the romance he unfolds elusive , and the occa - sional incisive phrase scarcely worth the cost of a passage down the bristling array of un - familiar names and through the droning chron - icles , not prone to yield up too easily their ghostly memories of dead years .

		But the '' Gentle Reader , '' to borrow Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	's delightful connotation for the audience fit though few , he who does not read running , who has indeed no great love for the easy beaten track but much for the nooks and by - ways of literature and history , provided he may explore them in good company , the Gentle Reader , no less than the antiquary , will find an altogether unique pleasure in hunt - ing down the legend of the ring through the ponderous tomes of the German and Venetian chroniclers and the chatty pages of
Marino Sanuto	ORGANIZATION	's voluminous diaries .

		Not that the question of the ring 's owner - ship is of any great moment , but the search affords opportunity of forming acquaintance by the way with the turbulent , bitter-hearted Frangipanis , with the lovely
Apollonia	LOCATION	, dear in her youth to an Emperor and later Count
Christoph	PERSON	's willing wife , and with her brother
Matthew Lang	PERSON	, the courtly humanist , arch - bishop and cardinal , but best remembered for his unchurchly '' What is conscience ? ''

		Less intimately do we come to know a pope or two , and the sour-faced Emperor
Maximilian	PERSON	.

		And 228 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, over all broods the keen-eyed , thin-lipped
Doge Leonardo Loredano	PERSON	, he whom
Bellini	PERSON	painted , a spirit of
Venice	LOCATION	incarnate .

		For the chief charm of all this pageant is the glimpse it gives of the inscrutable soul of sixteenth century
Venice	LOCATION	, whose achievements stand out clearly enough on the pages of our histories , but the thoughts of whose heart are hidden , except from the initiated few .

		Dr.
Thode	PERSON	is of course in the secret , which he does his best to share with the appreciative reader .

		But it is time to explain that the ring , named Frangipani 's , upon the chance sale of which to Dr.
Thode	PERSON	hangs the whole tale , is a hoop of finely chased gold , with the legend '' Willingly thine own '' graven upon it in Gothic script .

		It was found in the
year 1892	DATE	by a peasant digging near
Pordenone	LOCATION	in
Friuli	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Thode	PERSON	's romantic interest in .

		the original owner of the ring was immediately focused and deepened by his happening upon a mention of the presence of German troops in
Friuli	LOCATION	.

		The dates ,
1513	DATE	and
1514	DATE	, agreed with that indicated by the workmanship of the ring .

		Unable to find de - tailed reference to any officer except the com - mander-in-chief , he turned his search , half by chance , to
Count Frangipani	ORGANIZATION	.

		Almost at once he came upon an account of
Christoph	PERSON	's loss of a relic during the siege of Osopo , '' which accident seemed to him to bode only the gravest disaster . ''

		A letter of the
Countess Apollonia	ORGANIZATION	to her captive husband , which the indefatigable Sanuto has copied , was noted by Dr.
Thode	PERSON	a few days later .

		Its contents made him prac - tically certain that the relic was contained in , or perhaps lost at the same time with , a ring which the Countess had given her husband , and an exact duplicate of which she `` prays his Lordship '' to have graven in
Venice	LOCATION	that he may wear it '' for love 's sake and in remem - brance of me . ''

		The words , she explains , '' give the answer to those other words which stand in the ring sent me by your Lordship , the which I have by me . ''

		This is bare fact , a commodity in which Dr. ` Thode does not deal .

		Every stage of his in - vestigation is enriched by anecdote and allu - sion , and presented against a rich background of national or race history .

		One of the most ^ spirited chapters is that upon the Frangipani family , passionate , reckless tricksters , faith - less heroes , standing with
Venice	LOCATION	to-day , then v back on the Emperor 's side to-morrow , pos - sessed by no fixed policy except reconquest of their ancient possessions , and by no fear but a ^ fugitive one for their God .

		Count
Christoph	PERSON	comes honestly by his burning hatred of the Signoria , honestly too by the disgusting bru - tality with which he celebrates his first decisive victory , and by the desperate energy whereby , seeking to transform
Maximilian	PERSON	's listless ag - gression upon Venetian territory into a mad war to the death , he brings himself , when he has played out his hand , a priceless hostage to the dingy Torresella .

		No less strongly drawn than this stormy warrior , '' heir of all the passions and ambi - tions of his race , '' is the captive Frangipani , fretting through years of bitter inaction in the city he hates .

		Watching the gay life below him , he comes to appreciate as never before the power wielded by the long , resistless arm of the Ten , able in the midst of wars with half of
Christendom	LOCATION	to make their city a haven of peace and luxurious security .

		He writes lengthy letters to his wife ,
Apollonia	LOCATION	, and his father , the lawless
Bernhardin	PERSON	, curious mixtures of thanks to God who will some day give him the victory , propitiatory references to the noble Signoria -LRB- who overlooked his cor - respondence -RRB- , fervent expressions of love '' eternal and unchanging '' for his dear wife and revered father , and carefully explicit statements of his need of bed-linen , short-hose , and good Rhenish ducats for his present ne - cessities .

		Once he writes out , for the diversion of his keeper , an account of a dream he had , and he has no doubt much leisure for medita - tion upon the favors of princes and cardinals as well as upon the multitude of his own sins .

		For these , in characteristic Frangipani fashion , he repents , now that he has nothing better to do .

		He makes a vow to the
Madonna of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- oggia -LRB- which
Venice	LOCATION	never let him pay -RRB- , and devoutly carves his motto , '' My hope is set truly in God , '' over the grim walls of the
Torresella	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps he even took some part in the translation of the Germano-Roman Breviary , which was printed in
1518	DATE	three years after
Maximilian	PERSON	's Prayer-book .

		But before this , in the third year of his im - prisonment , came
Apollonia	LOCATION	to
Venice	LOCATION	, sick unto death , but ready '' to endure the very uttermost '' to be with her dearly loved lord .

		From this point the romance hastens on to its tragic finish .

		Apollonia died broken-hearted , and the count , left to his own passionate de - vices , broke prison and spent the eight years until his death in harassing the Venetian fron - tiers , fighting with the Turks , now as friend , now as enemy , and urging to a white heat the strife of factions in
Hungary	LOCATION	, whose throne is
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 evidently the goal of his lawless and ill-fated ambitions .

		The scholarly accuracy with which Dr.
Thode	PERSON	marshalls his folios is relieved and lightened by his almost childlike enthusiasm over his results .

		The tracing out of the ring 's ownership is truly , as the sub-title of his mono - graph puts it , '' an event in his life , '' a vivid experience into which he throws all the senti - ment of his quaint personality .

		And if , a better lover than his hero , he can not suppress an oc - casional rhapsody over
Apollonia	LOCATION	, and perhaps reads a bit of himself into the moody Croatian Count , his story is surely none the worse for the fault . ''

		I read the words no !

		I heard them ! ''

		he announces naively of the motto on his treas - ured ring .

		It is this very freshness and dra - matic enthusiasm in his point of view that makes his book unique , and alive in spite of the fact that its complex setting is absolutely new ground for the average reader .

		Another quality rare in the antiquary is our author 's truly epic feeling for the value of di - gression .

		Not without the predilection of his kind for citations and footnotes , he relegates his bibliography to a brief appendix ; but he revels in legitimate episode , and is never in too much haste to indulge in a bit of friendly chat upon side-issues .

		Of
Marino Sanuto	PERSON	, the
Boswell	PERSON	of sixteenth century
Venice	LOCATION	, he tells us that his handwriting is '' not very legible . ''

		The citations from another chronicler , a love - lorn captain of
Vicenza	LOCATION	, are prefaced by the wholly irrelevant information that it was he who first set down in writing the sad story of the loves of Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, as it was told him by a romantic fellow in his troop .


Albert Diirer	PERSON	's visit to
Venice	LOCATION	is introduced apropos of a possible meeting between him and Apol - lonia 's brother the goldsmith , while we catch a glimpse of the '' monkish brawl '' just con - vulsing
Germany	LOCATION	as it cast its shadow over the joyless death-bed of
Maximilian	PERSON	.

		The present edition of '' Frangipani 's Ring '' is a sumptuous one , richly illustrated with very beautiful photographic reproductions .

		These include portraits of
Maximilian	PERSON	and the Doge Leonardo Loredano a comparison of which goes far toward explaining Venetian triumphs , odd cuts from
Maximilian	PERSON	's and the
Frangi	PERSON	- pani Prayer-books , and photographs of
Jan Schorel	ORGANIZATION	's altar-piece ordered for the church in Ober-Vellach by
Apollonia	ORGANIZATION	's daughter and representing , with the kindly leniency of the old masters ,
Saints Christoph	PERSON	and
Apollonia	ORGANIZATION	flanking a central panel of the Holy Family .

		For this elegant book with its wide margined pages , its curious chapter-headings designed by a friend of Dr.
Thode	PERSON	, and its choice repro - ductions of Diirer and
Bellini	PERSON	, the linen cover seems a singularly inappropriate housing .

		THE PERVERSION OF HISTORY .

		* Mr.
Ernest Belfort Bax	PERSON	is the author of many excellent works on socialism , and in par - ticular early made a name and a place for him - self in an examination of the religious and ethical aspects of the modern socialistic move - ment .

		Of late he has turned his attention to history , in monographs upon periods of popular revolution and the men who created them .

		In this work he has evidently adopted the method of the scholar in the study of his subject , and that of the partisan in the writing of his book .

		Great labor in research is exhibited , facts are accurately stated and citations are exact , but deductions from those facts are so colored by a bitter socialistic prejudice as to be entirely untrustworthy .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	's latest effort , a life of
Marat	PERSON	, is a notable example of this biased perspective .


Marat	PERSON	, the bete noir of the
Girondin	PERSON	his - torians of the French Revolution , from whom other historians have until recently taken their cue , has commonly been described as a man of little ability , limited influence , unbounded ferocity , and a personality disgusting both in its physical and mental characteristics .

		From this dictum Mr.
Bax	PERSON	rescues his hero .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	is not alone nor is he first in portraying his subject in the newer light .

		All careful modern historians coincide with the view which shows
Marat	PERSON	to be in fact a man of education , distinguished as a physician and a scientist .

		A disciple of
Rousseau	PERSON	, he sacrificed position and wealth to the cause of the people , and by the integrity of his conduct , as well as the radical character of his political views , main - tained great influence over the Parisian popu - lace .

		He , far more than
Robespierre	LOCATION	and his friends , led the Jacobin attack upon the
Giron	PERSON	- dists , standing at first utterly alone in the bit - ter struggle , and winning his victory by sheer courage and force of will .

		He was honestly convinced of the necessity of the violence which he urged .

Boston	LOCATION	: Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		230 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, sufficient emphasis the influence he exerted , or the devotion of the people to his person .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	brings out all these qualities of person and conditions of influence , and in do - ing so exhibits unusual biographical ability ; but he goes far beyond other writers in his unbounded admiration for
Marat	PERSON	's abilities , and in approval of his acts .

		It is one thing to applaud the purity of
Marat	PERSON	's motives , an - other to approve the motive itself ; one thing to uphold his honesty of purpose in the use of violence , another to defend the results of that violence .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	yields all his admiration to all that
Marat	PERSON	did or wished to do .

		He does more than this : he defends every act and every incident of
Marat	PERSON	's life with the ardor of a fanatical partisan , while the results of such de - fense are published under the guise of a critical and a scholarly examination of his subject .

		Moreover , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	is either dishonest or illog - ical in the arguments advanced in
Marat	PERSON	's be - half , e. g. ,
Marat	PERSON	denied any honesty of purpose or patriotic enthusiasm to the nobles for their surrender of feudal rights on the famous night of
August 4	DATE	.

		That
Marat	PERSON	should have been thus unjust , is explained by Mr.
Bax	PERSON	on the ground of political necessity ; he could not risk the loss of political influence by approval of this act of the nobles , `` and hence from the politician 's point of view , rather than the psy - chologist 's ,
Marat	PERSON	's caustic criticism appeared completely justified . ''

		But inasmuch as Mr.
Bax	PERSON	invariably measures his hero from the standpoint of the psychologist , as he must in order to defend his acts with any degree of success , his inconsistency here weakens his cause .

		Naturally the author 's greatest difficulty arises from the necessity to explain and con - done
Marat	PERSON	's continual invocation of the use of violence to secure and maintain social and political revolution .

		It is certain that
Marat	PERSON	believed force necessary to secure these ends , and was not only not bloodthirsty , as his enemies accused him of being , but was even personally distressed at the necessity of using such means .

		But Mr.
Bax	PERSON	is not fortunate in his treatment of this subject .

		Writing of various exhortations in the Ami du Peuple to lop off the heads of aristocrats , he says : '' There can be no doubt whatever that by such utter - ances as these ,
Marat	PERSON	, whose single-minded object was to save the Revolution from the various plots which there is no denying were at this time being constantly hatched against it , was only concerned to keep public attention alive to the manoeuvres of the Court and its satellites . ''

		He concludes with a quotation from a '' Fort - nightly Review '' article by Mr.
Bowen	PERSON	Graves . ''

		Threats of bloodshed are , no doubt , only too fre - quent , but always in language such as , to an impartial mind , excludes the idea of calculation .

		One day it is ten thousand heads that must fall , the next it is a hun - dred thousand , a third it drops to fifty thousand , a fourth to twenty , and so on .

		A few hours before his death , he tells us in his journal what he meant by them : ' I used them , ' he says , ' with a vi'ew to produce a strong impression on men 's minds , and to destroy all fatal security . ' ''

		Thus
Marat	PERSON	is here acquitted of any intention actually to carry out his threats .

		But in an - other chapter , treating of
Marat	PERSON	as a political power , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	, in order to prove the personal magnetism of his hero , recounts a conversation between
Marat	PERSON	and
Robespierre	LOCATION	in which the latter said he supposed the '' sanguinary de - mands for the blood of enemies of liberty were only spoken in the air , and were not seriously meant . ''

		Marat indignantly denied this . ''

		As to its being no mere rhetorical form , he assured
Robespierre	LOCATION	that , after the horrible affair of
Nancy	LOCATION	, he could have decimated the barbarous deputies who ap - plauded it ; that he would willingly have sent the in - famous judges of the Chatelet to the stake ; that again , after the massacre of the Champ de Mars , if he had but found two thousand men animated with the same sentiments as himself , he would have placed himself at their head , poignarded the General -LRB-
Lafayette	LOCATION	-RRB- in the midst of his brigand-battalions , burnt the despot in his palace , and strangled the traitorous representatives in their seats , as he had declared at the time .

		Robes - pierre listened to me with terror , ' he says , ' he grew pale and was silent for some time . ' ''

		So after having asserted that
Marat	PERSON	did not really mean to proceed to extremities , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	, in his desire to emphasize his hero 's political influence , reverses his previous judgment .

		These extracts refer to a period when
Marat	PERSON	had not yet had the opportunity of putting into effect his threats of violence .

		When , later ,
Marat	PERSON	really became a leader in the Sep - tember massacres , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	shifts the ground of his defense to an insistence upon the purity of
Marat	PERSON	's motives , and to a favorite compari - son with the acts of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	at the time of the Parisian commune of
1871	DATE	.

		He says : '' The thousand odd victims -LRB- of the
September	DATE	Mas - sacres -RRB- were almost wholly well-to-do hangers-on of the Court .

		But who were the twenty or thirty thousand victims of
1871	DATE	?

		Almost wholly workmen , partisans of a cause avowedly hostile to wealth and privilege , and therefore hated by wealth and privilege .

		Herein lies the ground of the divergence in the world 's judg - ment of the two events .

		If the ' world ' would only be candid in the matter , and avow openly that it likes well-to-do Royalist plotters , and dislikes Proletarian insurgents , we should know where we were , and the issue would at least be clear . ''

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 231 Putting aside other considerations tending to form the '' world 's '' judgment upon these two events , it is at least clear that a policy of violence , solely destructive in its purpose , and failing in its objects , can not stand in popular judgment , with a violent constructive policy that succeeded .

		Looking only at the purity of motive , as does Mr.
Bax	PERSON	in defense of
Marat	PERSON	, it is difficult to see why an equal purity of motive should not be ascribed to
Thiers	PERSON	.

		Yet
Thiers	PERSON	is a '' scoundrel , '' while
Marat	PERSON	is a hero .

		In a like manner Mr.
Bax	PERSON	characterizes each of
Marat	PERSON	's opponents :
Lafayette	LOCATION	is a rascal , Mirabeau a traitor ,
Bailly	PERSON	a silly-minded savant .

		The royalists and constitutional mon - archists are always denied any patriotic honesty of purpose , and
Marat	PERSON	is always right in re - garding them as intriguing plotters , and fit subjects for violent retribution .

		Surely if the '' lying Carlyle '' has perverted history in the interest of a class , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	is equally guilty in the interest of a social theory .

		Of
Marat	PERSON	's assassination he writes : '' Ob , exponents of a class public opinion , satellites of privileged power and wealth , wbose tap of indigna - tion and gassy borror is always turned on to the full whenever a representative of privileged class-interest is smitten down you who can slaver a slain monarch or statesman with undeserved adulation , who can fulmi - nate against the anthor of his death at the top of your voices , when will you find your cant no longer profitable ?

		What has been your attitude towards the ' People 's Friend ' and the dastardly wretch who murdered him her sick and helpless victim ?

		As one might only ex - pect , your sympathy has changed sides .

		Your horror ' at assassination has suddenly evaporated .

		For the man who suffered a four years ' martyrdom for his convic - tions and for the cause of the disinherited , and who finally sealed his testimony with his blood , you have no words but those of coarse vituperation and the foulest calumnies that malice can divise ... To every un - prejudiced reader of history the deed of
Charlotte	LOCATION	Cor - day must appear as the most dastardly , cruel , and wanton political assassination in the world 's archives . ''

		Invective is not the weapon best suited to win a hostile '' world , '' nor will a denial of patriotic motives to the opponents of Marat enable Mr.
Bax	PERSON	to convince the '' unprejudiced reader of history . ''

		Thus his very partisan - ship forbids the realization of his object .

		Has he an object ?

		The u lying Carlyle '' did not intentionally pervert history , for he gave the facts as he knew them .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	, idealizing
Marat	PERSON	, stating the facts of his life and influence , and mis-stating the motives of other patriots , seeks to emphasize the rights of a propaganda of socialistic reform , as against all constituted government , and to deny to such governments the right of self-defense .

		He has not merely perverted history : he has prostituted it , for it is impossible to believe that a man of Mr.
Bax	PERSON	's ability and scholarship , as exhibited in other writings , is in this instance either uncon - sciously dishonest or honestly illogical .

		It is unfortunate for the reputation of Marat that the author 's purpose , evident to the most casual reader , casts an unjust doubt on the real great - ness of his hero .

		OUTL.IXES OF GERMAX LITERATURE .

		* In easy and popular style , Professor
R. W. Moore	PERSON	has presented the main outlines of Ger - man literature in his '' History of German Literature . ''

		The book is a revision and exten - sion of a course prepared for English readers , which has been tested for several years in col - lege classes .

		Its purpose is to offer in a concise and attractive way a course for students and others who wish to know something about the great men and the important works of German literature . ''

		The characteristics of the different literary movements are clearly stated ; the writers of each period are treated according to their importance , and brief resumes give a general knowledge of their best works .

		As is to be expected , the main portion is devoted to the literature of the modern period , beginning with Luther .

		Luther 's work in giving to the German nation a uniform , stan - dard literary language is justly praised as his '' greatest service to literature .

		Especially through his translation of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which came into the people 's hands all through Ger - many , did this new High German gain a foot - hold , and become the exclusive literary lan - guage , that has remained until the present time '' -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- .

		Perhaps more space should have been devoted to his work , which was the most important of any before the classical period .

		His reforms were not confined to re - ligious beliefs , but influenced all parts of life by exalting the individual and stimulating personal effort .

		His prose writings show great variety of style , and contributed much to the development of the literature by arousing a national feeling and stirring men to mental action .

		The classical period receives the fullest treatment , as it deserves .

		As with special preference the author dwells on the two greatest names , the poets of Faust and
Wallenstein	PERSON	, The latter he calls '' the first and greatest poet '' in the popular mind . ''

		His poetry by its wide circulation and its natural genuineness has nourished in the Ger - man people the most noble sentiments love for the fatherland , for freedom , for honor , for justice and truth , for friendship and fidelity '' -LRB- p. 175 -RRB- .

		In Goethe , on the other hand , '' were united
Klopstock	PERSON	's ability to enrich the language ,

		Of the multitude of authors of the present age , the most important are briefly discussed , and the various literary tendencies are clearly brought out .

		The tendency during the last few years is described as a '' revolt of the working classes against the middle classes . ''

		Some will miss familiar authors , although the list of those mentioned is quite complete .

		Bertha von Siittner 's '' Waffen Nieder '' might have been used as a good illustration of the `` novels of purpose '' -LRB- p. 251 -RRB- .


Johanna Ambrosius	PERSON	, whose poetry so touched the people recently , and
Rosegger	PERSON	, whose simple sketches are full of the breath of nature , seem to de - serve some brief recognition .

		Credit might have been given -LRB- p. 193 -RRB- to the scholarly labors of
Jacob	PERSON	and
William Grimm	PERSON	in the domain of mediaeval literature and especially in legend and folk-lore .

		Men - tion might also have been made of the cele - brated historians of the present age , such as
Mommsen	PERSON	,
Ranke	PERSON	, von Sybel , and Treitschke , whose works are ornaments of literature as well as of scholarship .

		But these criticisms are slight compared to the merit of the work as a whole , which will prove a boon to college classes and to many general readers .

		About a hundred illustrations , all of authentic or his - torical nature , are an attractive feature .

		RECENT ECONOMIC LITERATURE .

		* For several decades past , studies made by English - speaking economists in the theory of distribution have been mostly of a fragmentary character .

		The promulgation of the law of marginal utility by
Jevons	PERSON	and the Austrian writers has been followed by a mass of literature dealing with theories of value and price , and numerous attempts have been made to apply these theories to the valuation of labor , the origin of interest , and to explaining the existence of surplus-values in the shape of profits and rent .

		Not until recent years have there been serious attempts made to harmonize and consolidate these theories into a general theory of distribution .

		Of these attempts none seems more satisfactory or more likely to find a permanent place in the - literature of economics than the works of Messrs.
Clark	PERSON	and
Hobson	PERSON	now before us .

		Both writers have contributed largely to the de - velopment and extension of the theories above mentioned .

		Professor
Clark	PERSON	's theoretical work alone covers a period of twenty-five years , while , for at least a decade , Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	has been promi - nent among the British economists of the newest school .

		There is not space within the limits of this article to do more than give a scanty notice to the theory of distribution developed by each author , and there is no room to institute an adequate comparison between them .

		Perhaps even a lengthy comparison would at present be premature , since Professor
Clark	PERSON	's work is an unfinished one , and it is only in the second volume which he promises that we .

		may ex - pect to find work analogous to that done by Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	in his present treatise .

		Nevertheless , there are some points of resemblance which may be noted , and some points of difference between the theories of the two writers which may be briefly touched upon .

		Both writers agree in making the price of commodities the starting point in the theory of distribution .

		Professor
Clark	PERSON	takes normal price as his starting point , for he is investigating distri - bution in a static society in which all disturbing forces are eliminated and competition alone has free play .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	, on the other hand , takes as his starting point the market price of commodi - * THE DISTRIBUTION OP WEALTH .

		THE DIAL 233 ties , because his study of distribution begins with the bargaining process which goes on in actual life between buyer and seller .

		Competition does not in such a case fix the price of commodities , but only the limits below which the seller will not go and above which the buyer will not go .

		Between these two limits the actual price is determined by the superior bargaining power of a single buyer or seller .

		This leads to an element of forced gain that accrues to that side of buyers or sellers which possesses the shrewdest bargainer .

		In addition to this , there is a differential gain shared in by all buyers and sellers whose subjective valuations lie beyond the limits within which the price is fixed .

		In a static state , such as is described by Professor
Clark	PERSON	, no element of forced gain could appear .

		Each party to the bargain in fixing a price would secure the full measure of its productivity .

		Applied to the case of the factors of production , free com - petition tends to give labor what it creates , to capital what it creates , and to entrepreneurs what the coordinating function creates . ''

		In both theories , the element of differential gain still remains .

		If , for example , on a given amount of land a number of units of labor of equal productivity be applied unit by unit , the productivity of the labor will diminish after a certain point has been reached .

		As the units of labor are supposedly equal , the product of the final unit will fix the wages of each and every other unit , and a rent will accrue to land as a result of the surplus created by the application of the earlier units .

		This is rent in the Ricardian sense , a differential gain secured by land as a result of the diminishing productivity of labor upon the land .

		But we may have the same thing in the case of capital .

		The application of successive units of labor to a fixed amount of capital will result in differential gains which accrue in this instance to capital .

		Reversing the process and applying units of capital to a given amount of labor , we find capital subject to the same law of diminishing returns , and labor in this case secures a surplus , rent .

		This ex - tension of rent by Professor
Clark	PERSON	to all the factors of production is exactly paralleled in the discussion by Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	.

		Corresponding to the forced gain in the sale of commodities , there may be a marginal rent in the sale of the factors of production which is not the same as the differential rent explained by Ricardo as accruing to land and by Professor
Clark	PERSON	as due to all the factors of production .

		We have already stated that Professor
Clark	PERSON	does not find this forced gain or marginal rent existing in a static society .

		What we here wish to emphasize is that both writers agree in extending the conception of differential rents to labor and capital as well as to land .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	holds that we can not speak of a margin of employment for land any more than we can for capital and labor .

		If we can say that the worst land in cultivation bears no rent , we can just as well say that the worst placed capital gets no interest and the worst employed labor receives no wage .

		If this theory be true that a differential gain may under certain circumstances accrue to labor , it is clear that we can not speak of an expro - priation of the product of labor by capitalists and land-owners .

		The distribution of the surplus will depend upon the relative supply of the three factors of production .

		If labor is scarce as compared to capital and land , the surplus will go to labor , and we might with equal fairness speak of the exploita - tion of capital by the laborer .

		There is no ex - ploitation involved in giving to any factor the share which the final unit produces .

		The recent interest in trusts has brought forward numerous books , pamphlets , and magazine articles dealing with that interesting and perplexing prob - lem .

		Among the discussions of this topic most favorably received have been the recent books by Professor
Jenks	PERSON	and Mr.
Collier	PERSON	, which must here be dealt with more briefly than they deserve .

		Both works are written for the general reader rather than for the advanced student in economics , and with few exceptions they contain little that has not been made available to the student by earlier and more complete investigations .

		The scope of the in - quiry is practically the same in each of the vol - umes , and the two authors agree in the main in their conclusions .

		Both writers admit that the chief cause of the growth of industrial combinations in the
past quarter century	DATE	has been intense and often wasteful competition .

		Both authors also agree in the statement that special privileges such as patents , tariff legislation , and railway discriminations , have often aided in this growth .

		Professor
Jenks	PERSON	is , however , more logical in his attitude toward these privileges than is Mr.
Collier	PERSON	.

		For the latter , hav - ing admitted that competition is the chief and suf - ficient cause of trusts , maintains that the abolition of these special privileges would cause the disap - pearance of the majority of the trusts .

		It should also be noted that Professor
Jenks	PERSON	views with more concern the disappearance of competition as a force which controls prices , than does Mr.
Collier	PERSON	.

		Both authors , however , regard potential competition as in the main a sufficient safeguard for the consumer of trust-made commodities in cases where neither legal nor natural monopolies exist .

		A study of the prices charged by some of the great industrial com - binations such as the sugar , whiskey , kerosene , tin - plate , and wire and steel trusts , made by Professor
Jenks	PERSON	for the
United States Industrial Commission	ORGANIZATION	, leads him to the conclusion that while prices have fallen since the establishment of these combinations the general level of prices is somewhat higher than would have probably prevailed had competition had full play in these industries .

		The statements often made by trust managers that industrial combina - tions have made the market for their products more steady seems to have little justification .

		The temp - tation to raise prices , or to maintain them at a high level , is so strong that when once a monopoly has been established few trust managers have been able to resist the desire for high profits .

		This in the 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, case of capitalistic monopolies has inevitably re - sulted in the bringing into the field of new capital to compete with the trust , and before the latter could regain its former supremacy it has been ob - liged to buy up or coerce these competing estab - lishments .

		The most serious menace to the public from the trusts is probably to be found in the methods by which these combinations are being organized and manipulated .

		The principal sufferer is not the consumer but the investor .

		The great success of certain of these combinations has brought into the field of corporation finance within recent years a class of persons known as promoters , whose business consists in the efforts to form combinations among industrial establishments which have hitherto been subject to the control of competition .

		In this way industrial consolidation has been brought about in many cases where it would not have taken place , at least for some time to come , had natural forces alone controlled .

		The promoter is usually paid for his ef - forts by common stock issued beyond the capitalized valuation of the property of the consolidated com - panies .

		In addition to receiving preferred stock , whose par value equals the total capitalized value of their property , the owners of the establishments thus consolidated usually receive a bonus in the shape of large amounts of common stock .

		There is further - more the underwriter , usually a banker , who under - takes the sale of the stock .

		He also receives his pay in common stock .

		It is not difficult to see that in this way trusts are capitalized far beyond the limits which a prudent financial administration would warrant .

		One of the most prominent of our present industrial combinations has in this way been cap - italized at
$ 50,000,000	MONEY	, while the total selling value of the properties consolidated was only
$ 18,000,000	MONEY	.

		Excessive capitalization means stock and bank speculation , losses to investors , dangers to consumers from an attempt to raise prices so as to pay divi - dends on the stock thus issued , instability to busi - ness , and perhaps a panic brought about by the collapse of these undertakings .

		Of the remedies proposed , the one most insisted upon by both the above writers is publicity in re - gard to the finances and the methods employed by these combinations .

		Publicity alone would prob - ably cause the disappearance of some of the chief evils connected with trust organization and man - agement , and until we have this publicity , as Pro- fessor
Jenks	PERSON	well says , we can not proceed wisely in the application of further remedies .

		Both writers apparently admit that the trust has brought much good and that it has come to stay .

		Prohibition has everywhere proved a failure , and is not recom - mended by either writer .

		The abolition of the special privileges which have aided in the growth of trust formation , and the prevention of over - capitalization , are of course advocated wherever the removal of these special privileges would not cause a serious derangement of industry .

		Mr.
Collier	PERSON	would add to these remedies by making directors of these great corporations responsible to the full amount of their property instead of giving to them the limited liability conceded to other stockholders .

		In case these remedies proved insufficient , he would have acts of monopoly declared a crime , leaving to the courts the difficult task of deciding whether or not monopoly really existed .

		Professor
Edward D. Jones	PERSON	, of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, is responsible for a well-written little volume on '' Economic Crises . ''

		This is the first systematic treatment of this subject in its entirety that we have had in English .

		Professor
Jones	PERSON	does not undertake to discuss at any length partic - ular crises and their causes .

		His work is chiefly a review of the theories of crises which have been brought forward by other writers , and a critical examination of these theories in the light of our present economic knowledge .

		The treatment is somewhat fragmentary in character , and the author is perhaps a little too dogmatic in his own state - ment of opinions , but on the whole the discussion of the various theories is made in an impartial manner , and the conclusions seem to be the result of sound reasoning .

		There is an able chapter on the periodicity of crises in which the author , while not denying the existence of periodicity , claims that the proof of such regularity in the appearance of crises is not yet sufficient , and that no explanation for such periodicity has been offered which is at all adequate .

Jones	PERSON	lays great stress on the abuse of credit as the cause of crises , but points out that there is a danger in attributing crises to a single kind of credit abuse such as banking specu - lation .

		In the final chapter on the '' Psychology of Crises , '' the author studies the individualistic motives underlying crises .

		These industrial dis - turbances he declares to be due in large degree to a tendency toward speculation , and to undue optim - ism in regard to the outcome of business projects .

		The chief preventives the author finds in the sub - ordination of economic interests to other motives and in such an increase of information concerning the facts of the modern industrial world as is to be gained through commercial education .

		These rem - edies , however , furnish only a partial solution . ''

		The final extinguishment of crises will come through the progress of general economic evolution rather than as the result of the application of specific remedies . ''

		The title of Dr.
Fairchild	PERSON	's book , '' Rural Wealth and Welfare , '' the experience of its author who for thirty-five years has been connected with agricul - tural colleges , and the place of the treatise in '' The Rural Science Series , '' all would lead one to expect that the book was a treatise on agricultural economics , for which there is at present a genuine need .

		It is extremely disappointing , therefore , to find that Dr.
Fairchild	PERSON	's book is only another treat - ise on elementary economics , differing in no way from the average text-book on that subject , except that perhaps the majority of the illustrations are

		THE DIAL , 235 taken from farm life .

		The author has prepared some interesting and valuable charts intended to show that conditions of demand and supply are the controlling factors in the making of prices of agri - cultural commodities , and that speculative move - ments have exerted but little influence .

		He is wise in his insistence on the value of accurate crop sta - tistics to the agricultural class , and points out that such information would do more to destroy the demoralizing force of mere speculation than any pos - sible legal enactment . ''

		There are some sensible chapters on banking , insurance , and the tariff , and here and elsewhere there are good suggestions as to methods by which farmers may make use of division of labor , credit associations , and other means by which modern business has attained to successful organization and results .

		The value of these sug - gestions leads one to wish that this part of the work had been more fully worked out , leaving to other treatises the statement of elementary principles common to the whole field of economics .

		Dr. Fair - child takes an optimistic view of the drift of the farming population into the cities .

		He considers this merely a means of readjusting industrial ar - rangements , and one which is made possible and necessary by the wide use of agricultural machinery which has enabled three men to do the work
that fourteen did forty years ago	DATE	.

		Even the abandon - ment of
New England	LOCATION	farms he does not consider a great social loss , though it may have injured in - dividuals . ''

		These lands will find a profitable use in the wood lots throughout the
East	LOCATION	and in grazing ranches through the West , with slight permanent loss .

		They are not signs of poverty but of a devel - oping trait , just as the abandoned country woolen mills tell the story of immense growth in factory methods . ''

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's book , '' The Gospel of Wealth , '' consists of a group of essays , all of which have appeared in English or American magazines or periodicals .

		They cover a wide range of subjects biographical , economic , social , and political , but may perhaps be conveniently divided into three groups .

		The first five essays deal with social and industrial questions , the next two with the recent political tendencies in this country , while the last four deal with English political problems and ten - dencies .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's well-known views con - cerning the use to be made of large accumulations of wealth are set forth in the essay which gives the title to the book .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's natural attitude as a man who has accumulated an immense fortune , toward the accumulation of wealth , leads him to attach great importance in the social and industrial sphere to individual leadership .

		He is inclined even at this late day to agree with
Adam Smith	PERSON	that enterprises undertaken by joint stock companies are likely to prove failures unless they are con - trolled by a few able men .

		For the same reason he does not place much confidence in cooperative enterprises as a means of solving the labor problem .

		He takes a sympathetic attitude toward Trade - Unions , and is a firm believer in the justice of the sliding scale .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	deplores strikes , but calls upon employers to observe patience when strikes occur , and he recognizes the equity of the striking man 's commandment , '' Thou shalt not take thy neighbor 's job . ''

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's attitude on the question of Imperialism is well-known , and scarcely requires comment .

		He deals fairly with his opponents , and gives them credit for sincerity .

		His views concerning British administration in
India	LOCATION	, and the administration of tropical countries in general , are doubtless equally sincere , but they are opposed , it should be said , to the opinions of men who have observed less superficially and have studied the question more profoundly .

		Mr.
Car	PERSON	- negie opposes the imperial federation of
Britain	LOCATION	and her colonies , a scheme which he regards as impracticable as well as undesirable , but he dreams of an Anglo-Saxon alliance in which all English - speaking nations shall share .

		Nothing , however , has done so much to hasten the realization of such a project as the recent cooperation of the two great English-speaking nations in the far East , a move - ment which could not have taken place had it not been for our acquisition of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	possessions which Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has so strenuously and vigor - ously opposed .

		War and Labour '' is another of the numerous attempts made by political philosophers to promote universal peace .

		The author ,
M. Anitchkow	PERSON	, is , however , scarcely an idealist .

		He does not think that this peace can be made a never-ending one . ''

		War , '' he says , '' is the lot of mankind and the inevitable destiny of nations . ''

		In the first part of his treatise , the author reviews and criticises the various proposals which have been made by other writers to secure the same end .

		He decides that neither the increase of armaments , the greater de - structiveness of modern artillery , the efforts of peace societies , nor international agreements and courts of arbitration , will suffice to prevent the outbreak of war ; and he supports his statements with an abundance of historical evidence to show that the above mentioned methods have in the past failed to achieve this end .

		In Chapter I. of Book II .

		the author strikes the keynote of his argument .

		It is his claim that the prime cause of war in modern times is no longer religious or ethnographic differ - ences , but trade rivalry , which has led to modern tariffs , these imposts being the chief cause of international irritation .

		The administration of tariff ?

		, the author endeavors to show , differs in no material respect from the preliminaries to war .

		With the improvement in means of communication this administration becomes more difficult and more warlike in character .

		The chief use of troops in some countries even now , is to protect customs ad - ministration .

		The abolition of tariff restrictions would remove the chief cause of modern internat - ional hostility .

		The author in his hostility to tariff legislation would not even allow of fiscal tariffs , preferring to resort to direct taxation .

		He is much 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, influenced by
Henry George	PERSON	, and one of his best chapters is little more than a re-statement of
Henry George	PERSON	's doctrine contained in `` Protection and Free Trade . ''

		He is also much influenced by
Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	, but claims that the great French econo - mist has not dared to go the whole way in his advocacy of a universal market and absolute free - trade .

		Freedom of trade and freedom of migration , says
M. Anitchkow	PERSON	, would remove the only causes of contemporary antagonism .

		The safety of foreign investments would thus be guaranteed , for the cause of jealousy would be removed .

		The third part of the book seems to have little relation to what has gone before .

		It consists in the main of loosely constructed arguments for freedom in in - dustry , technical education , industrial cooperation , government ownership of railways , etc. .

		The author wanders in a dreamy sort of fashion from one ideal to another , believing them all to be resultants of his proposed reforms , without stopping to indicate how these reforms are to realized , or why they are to be considered inevitable .


M. B. HAMMOND	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Emperor ^ r -
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	's '' Life of the
Frederick	PERSON	^ life Emperor Frederick '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , ed - and character .

		ited f rom the Q erman o f Margaretha von Poschinger , appears simultaneously with the final instalment of the more voluminous original .

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	has selected from
Fratllein Posch	PERSON	- inger 's mass of material such portions as seemed most likely to interest English readers , and he has eliminated so far as possible all second-hand com - ment and appreciation .

		The volume is thus in the main composed of conversations , letters , and per - sonalia of monarchs , soldiers , savants , statesmen , and men of letters , so arranged as to form an ac - count of the public and private life of the Emperor told in the words of witnesses able in most cases to speak directly to the facts .

		The inherent defects , as well as merits , of biography made on this plan are obvious ; and Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	is at least to be credited with a very good piece of literary joiner - work , in which the materials are sound and well - chosen , and put together in a workmanlike way .

		It may be added that in many cases the documents so laboriously assembled by the pious care of
Frattlein Poschinger	ORGANIZATION	have an interest of their own to which that which they owe to their bearing on the career or character of Emperor
Frederick	PERSON	is secondary .

		The life of ''
Unser Fritz	PERSON	'' was largely part and parcel of some of the most important phases of the history of his time ; his character was such as to gild with a ray of splendor what future history will probably regard as the declining day of European royalty of the old type .

		It may perhaps be urged that not absolutism but liberalism is heir to the lustre of his virtues ; that in many things he was at heart a generous apostate from the tradition of his race .

		It was a true instinct which led the people to regard him , not as a being of superior clay , but as ' Unser Fritz '' our
Fritz	PERSON	.

		An ardent cham - pion of tolerance , he opposed every exercise of ar - bitrary power ; a master of the military art , he abhorred war , and the laurels of victory turned to the cypress of mourning in his grasp . ''

		I detest this butchery , '' he sadly remarked on the morrow of triumph ; '' I have never longed for war laurels , and would willingly have left such fame to others without envying them . ''

		At once the people 's choice and the representative of the hereditary principle , he was indeed `` every inch a king . ''

		His mantle has scarcely fallen upon his bustling and eccentric successor who has , however , by no means fulfilled the unflattering expectations formed of him .

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's book is interesting and full of meat , and it is presentably got up .

		An excellent Mr -
George Parker Winship	PERSON	^ s bibliography '' Cabot Bibliography '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is of the Caboit .

		an exhaustive and scholarly piece of work .

		An introduction of some fifty pages gives a concise account of what is actually known about the Cabots .

		Mr.
Winship	PERSON	has distinguished clearly between the historical value of strictly contemporary evidence and that of the later gossip of the histor - ians , whose personal acquaintance with
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	has blinded us to the carelessness and indi - rectness of their testimony .

		Upon the same prin - ciple , he has relegated the legends of the so-called ''
Cabot	PERSON	map '' to a position of secondary importance , no certain connection between the map and the navigator having been established .

		The biblio - graphy proper consists of two parts , a list of early documents , books , and maps relating to the Cabots , and a list of the later books , articles , and addresses that have been printed about them , containing altogether nearly six hundred titles .

		The titles are supplemented by excellent explana - tory and critical notes , which constitute the chief value of the work .

		We have but one fault to find with the bibliography , and that respects its arrange - ment in alphabetical order .

		In our opinion a chronological order would have much better served the purpose of the lists .

		It would have disclosed the original material in the order of historical se - quence , and have distinguished more clearly its relative value .

		It would have grouped the later discussions around the successive storm centres of the Cabot controversy , and have developed natur - ally its origin and subsequent course .

		An index of names would then have rendered the whole easy of reference .

		As it is , the lists are somewhat bewil - dering and difficult to read .

		The order suggested would have made them easy and interesting an extraordinary thing for a bibliography .

		Probably it will be said that the book is not intended to be read , but it is certainly a distinct advantage to make a book readable , if it can be done .

		Mr.
Winship	PERSON	's knowledge of Cabot sources and literature is so extensive , and his judgment so sound , that.it
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 would be a pity for him to rest with this work .

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	gave us a good popular account of the Cabots , hat a definitive statement still remains to be written a book that shall be final as far as a book can be .

		Mr.
Winship	PERSON	seems to have every qualification for writing such a book , and we trust that he has it in contemplation .

		The small volume by Dr.
David F. Lincoln	PERSON	, entitled '' Sanity of Mind '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is one of those meritori - ous works which one is disposed to criticise rather harshly because it could so easily have been better .

		It contains good material , served rather indiffer - ently well and with no executive skill .

		It has an important and a timely message , and along with other works of its class , will serve a good purpose in acquainting the interested public with the general nature of some of the influences that make for mental health and disease .

		It brings the reader within speaking distance of mental abnormalities , and shows him how modern views of physiological and psychological functions may be applied in wise precept as well as in specific advice .

		The lesson of the volume is essentially practical ; its tone is educational and sociological .

		It considers the fac - tors of heredity and environment in the production of abnormally tending influences , and points out where the optimistic reformer may most effectively apply his philanthropic energies , and where the educator must be most actively upon his guard .

		It does this with moderate success , but not nearly so effectively as must be done before this type of ideas becomes absorbed into the thinking of the educated public .

		One of the points most successfully em - phasized is the value of activity in the cure and prevention of abnormal tendencies , not merely in extreme cases but in little ways .

		One is at once reminded of
James	PERSON	's classic chapter on habit , when the author , in insisting upon the necessity that ac - quisition should leave a tangible deposit in action , says : '' Probably the most insidious form of mental voluptuousness is the hearing of brilliant sermons and lectures . ''

		On the whole , one forms a more favorable impression of the author than of his book ; and yet any one interested in the spread of the point of view which Dr.
Lincoln	PERSON	advocates , and sympathetic with his sound and practical purposes , will be glad to recommend the work as a step in the right direction .

		The awakened sense of nationalism , re8Qltin g in the struggles on every hand of subject peoples to cast off the yoke of their foreign oppressors , is , together with the concomitant spread of constitutionalism or democracy , the central fact of nineteenth - century political history .

		The names of the leading heroes in the several wars for national independence are .

		or should be , familiar ones to a generation which now seems in some danger of forgetting the prin - ciple in defence of which so much blood has been spilt the principle , namely , that every people , however small , which is fit for self-government , or is demonstrably well on the way to that fitness , is and of right ought to be free and independent , '' and unpreyed upon by the commercial greed or terri - torial ambition of its stronger neighbors .

		In a vol - ume of 328 pages , Mr.
Edgar Sanderson	PERSON	tells in popular style the stories of leading '' Hero-Patriots of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Among the names inscribed on Mr.
Sanderson	PERSON	's roll of honor are
Diaz	ORGANIZATION	,
Hofer	PERSON	,
Bolivar	LOCATION	,
Bozzaris	LOCATION	,
Garibaldi	LOCATION	,
Kanaris	PERSON	, Abdel-Kader ,
Schamyl	LOCATION	,
Manin	PERSON	,
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Sanderson	PERSON	writes clearly and directly , avoiding the pitfalls of florid description and high-flown panegyric , and wisely letting the plain facts about his heroes speak for themselves .

		The narratives appear to be based on trustworthy sources of infor - mation .

		and the book is on the whole a good one for popular reading at a time when the popular mind needs a tonic that may serve to brace and fortify its sense of the claims and rights of aspiring nationalism .

		There are several portraits .

		The `` Outlines of Human Physiology '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Drs.

		The authors ' names are a sufficient guarantee that the contents have been well selected , with due regard to the latest investi - gations in the field of human physiology .

		Little attention is paid to the mechanism of experimental work in the laboratory , emphasis being laid upon the results of such work rather than upon the means by which they may be obtained .

		Dr.

		In the preface to the American edition Professor
Loeb	PERSON	calls attention to the extension of physiological research to the invertebrates in the now developing science of ex - perimental morphology , and to the application of physical chemistry to physiological problems .

		The results of this work , though important in their bear - ing on the fundamental laws of life , have not as yet found their way into medical text-books .

		Mr.
W. F. Apthorp	PERSON	has written for '' The Music Lover 's Library '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- what he calls a `` com - pendious sketch '' of '' The Opera , Past and Pres - ent . ''

		The work is brief , but it serves well its pur - pose , and the author has embodied in his not numerous pages the result of much historical re - search , besides the experience of a veteran pro- fessional critic .

		Prefixed by a portrait of the good woman whose virtues it celebrates , the '' mother '' of the

		It contrives to return to this earth something of the personality with which Mrs.

1855	DATE	she was married to
William Booth	PERSON	, preacher .

		She was never in good health , but spent no time in complaints , bringing up a large family , and so fill - ing her days with labor that the amount of it can only be estimated in results .

		To persuade them to alertness of vision she tells of the enchanting things she herself has been able to per - ceive with older and wiser eyes , of course , yet with no more skill than falls naturally to the lot of those who will do as they are bid .

Rome	LOCATION	by Heir
W. Helbig	PERSON	contains , in Italian translation , upwards of a score of 240 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, articles that have appeared upon this subject in
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean and American journals .

		Condemnation of the methods employed in the management of the Museum in question appears to be general , and the pamphlet before us offers impressive testimony to this fact .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition , practically unchanged as to text , of Professor Dean C.Worcester 's work on `` The
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	and Their People . ''

		Much water has flowed under the bridges since
this work first appeared three years ago	DATE	, but it remains one of the best accounts of land and people , from a scien - tific point of view , that we have .

		A volume of '' Songs of All Colleges , '' compiled and arranged by Messrs.
David B. Chamberlain	PERSON	and
Karl P. Harrington	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. Hinds & Noble	ORGANIZATION	.

		This handsome quarto of over two hundred pages includes most of the old favorites , as well as many of the later successes for which one will search the old collections in vain .

		The book should prove widely popular .

		Mr.
Herbert E. Walter	PERSON	and
Alice Hall Walter	PERSON	have prepared a list of one hundred birds observed in Lin - coln Park ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, during the
Spring	DATE	migrations , which they publish in the form of a small pamphlet entitled '' Wild Birds in
City Parks	LOCATION	. ''

		It is intended to serve as a help in identifying these transient visitors , and con - tains many useful hints to that end .

		It may be obtained of Mr.
F. C. Baker	PERSON	,
Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		The Philosophy of
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	, '' by Miss Grace
Neal Dolsen	PERSON	, is an issue of the '' Cornell Studies in Philosophy , '' and offers a fuller exposition than has hitherto been given in the English language of the writings of this vigorous and original thinker .

		The treatment is reasonably sympathetic , and the interest of the subject is so great that we predict for this essay a wider audience than is usually won by a technical philo - sophical monograph .

		The
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	's
Spring	ORGANIZATION	announcement list includes the following : `` Mr.
Chupes	PERSON	and Miss Jenny : The Life Story of Two
Robins	PERSON	, '' by
Effie Bignell	PERSON	; a revised edition of '' With the
Wild Flowers	ORGANIZATION	, from
Pussy Willow	ORGANIZATION	to Thistledown , '' by
Maud Going	PERSON	; `` The Next Great Awakening , '' by Dr.
Josiah Strong	PERSON	; '' The Creed of Presbyterians , '' by Rev.
Egbert Watson Smith	PERSON	; `` My Master , '' by
Swami Vivekananda	PERSON	; and '' First Years in Handicraft , '' by Mr.
Walter J. Kenyon	PERSON	.

		Professor
Mark H. Liddell	PERSON	's '' Chaucer , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an - excellent text for school use .

		It includes the Prologue , '' The Knightes Tale , '' and '' The Nonne Prestes Tale , '' together with an ex - position of the principles of Middle English grammar and phonology , a glossary , and notes .

		Much has been done of late in Chaucer scholarship , and this book , which presents the results of the most recent investigation , is necessarily better than its predecessors , excellent as some of these were in their day .

		The '' English Readings '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	constitute one of the best series of anno - tated school texts that have ever been produced .

		The '' Arnold '' and ''
Newman	PERSON	'' of Mr.
Gates	PERSON	, the `` Burke '' of Mr.
Perry	PERSON	, and the '' Byron '' of Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	are model books of their kind , and we can bestow a word of similar praise upon the '' Swift , '' recently edited by Mr.
F. C. Prescott	PERSON	.

		`` Gulliver '' and the `` Journal to Stella '' are not included in this volume , but the rest of Swift 's prose writings are well represented , and the edito - rial apparatus is all that we could reasonably expect .

		The flora includes seven hundred species .

		The descriptions are written in the very simplest language consistent with accuracy , and technical terms are omitted in every case where ordinary language is sufficiently concise and accurate to answer the purpose .

Chicago	LOCATION	, 111 .

		Illustrated .

		For introduction ,
30 cents	MONEY	.

		The '' Thought Reader '' recognizes the thought as the reality , and the sentence as its outward expression .

		The material for thought is developed along three lines , action sen - tences , games , and stories .

		The relation of muscular movement to thought is now gener - ally recognized .

		This fact explains why action sentences should be used in the process of learning to read .

		The child 's play interest has been correlated with his school work by means of games .

		Since these so thoroughly engross the child 's attention , they furnish excellent material for reading lessons .

		The stories are based upon the thoughts and emotions which are intimately related to the child 's experience .

		274 A DIFFICULTY OF SYMPATHY .

		The man of advancing years , who has kept his intellectual outlook undimmed , and who has escaped the apathy that so frequently en - velopes the soul when the meridian of life is left behind , suffers no little perplexity when he seeks to enter into the consciousness of the new generation that is growing up about him .

		He feels that the ideals pursued by the finer spirits of the race are still the ideals to whose pursuit his own early years were given , but the books which serve these ideals as vehicles seem somehow to elude his sympathies ; his most penetrative scrutiny can not find in them the same sustenance that was provided by the books read in his own youth , his most insistent questioning can not evoke from them the same response .

		The literature of ideas , and to a certain extent the literature of artistic form , seems to such an observer to have undergone a process of subtle deterioration , and the in - tellectual influences of the vanished past seem to have been replaced by influences less potent than those of old to touch to fine issues the human spirit .

		He finds it almost impossible to realize that the books which appeal most strongly to the rising generation do in truth embody a message essentially the same as that which came to him a generation before clothed in far different modes of phrasing .

		The ex - pression of the new writings has been so shaped by the form and pressure of the new time that such a reader feels sadly old-fashioned in its presence , and shrinks from the contact to bury himself once more in the writings upon which his own soul has fed ever since the impression - able time when it was first awakened by their call .

		What he forgets is that the years that bring the philosophic mind bring also the crit - ical habit , and that no one can make a really fair comparison between the books that were read at twenty and those that are read at forty or fifty .

		There are few of us , however , who are suf - ficiently broad-minded to recognize , to the ex - tent of all its implications , the fact that every generation is bound to receive its most effective and vital guidance from the leaders of its own ranks .

		Some few books there are , of course , 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, that never grow old the bibles , the philoso - phies , and the great poems .

		But books of the secondary order lose their influence after a few years , because all such books are derivative in character , and can not share in the immortality of creative work .

		This is the truth which we fail to grasp when we find the younger men growing up about us taking scant heed of the masters of our own youth , and serving what are apt to seem to us false gods .

		We find ourselves out of touch with the strange new prophets who are gaining so great a following * Their soothsayings perplex and bewilder us , for they put things in unaccustomed ways , and we think that the ways long familiar to our own thought are the clearest , and should suffice those who come after us .

		It is the old wine , no doubt , but the bottles have been renewed , and the taste seems different .

		What we have just been saying is illustrated by
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's recent response to the re - quest that he send a message to the American people . ''

		If I had to address the American people , I should like to thank them for the great help I have received from their writers who flourished about the fifties .

		I would men - tion
Garrison	PERSON	,
Parker	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Ballou	PERSON	, and
Thoreau	PERSON	, not as the greatest , but as those who , I think , specially influenced me .

		Other names are Channing ,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man a bright constellation , such as is rarely to be found in the literatures of the world .

		And I should like to ask the American people why they do not pay more attention to these voices , and continue the good work in which they made such hopeful progress . ''

		How far away from us this voice seems , in time as well as in space .

		Two or three of these names still mean something in vital power to the younger generation , but the others have become merely historical .

		What young man would now think of turning to
Ballou	PERSON	or Channing or
Parker	PERSON	for help in shaping his ideals of thought and conduct ?

		But the sender of this message is himself a powerful factor in the new idealism , and the thought of the older men to whom he acknowledges grateful indebtedness has again become a living force in his burning appeal to our better instincts .

		There seems to be no help for it . ''

		The old order changeth , giving place to new , '' not only in our material and social environment , but in our spiritual existence as well .

		Yet in the latter sphere as in the former the change is in the accidental , not the essential order .

		The physical world remains the same , and human nature remains the same , and truth , beauty , and goodness remain the same , if we only con - trive to view them sub specie ceternitatis .

		The new order of thought is nothing more than a new way of stating old truth , and with every new form of statement , there comes a better illumination ; we see more clearly into the dark corners , and we catch the gleam of facets which we did not before suspect to exist .

		The mind that has stiffened into particular modes of ex - pression misses much that is suggestive and inspiring in the restless movement of contem - porary thought .

		There is no possession more desirable than the plasticity of mind that can adapt itself to new forms , and take fresh im - pressions year after year .

		The retention of this susceptibility is chiefly a matter of the will , and the man who succeeds in retaining it is much more to be envied than the man who allows his sympathies to become atrophied , withdrawing himself from the present into the past , and cutting himself off from participation in the spiritual progress of the race .

		A DASH INTO AESTHETIC .

		To meddle with theories of art is a good deal like making an excursion into the Arctic regions with a purpose of reaching the ultimate North .

		We must carry our provisions with us and expect a scarcity of human society .

		But the mystery entices and the desire to completely account for things urges on explorers in both cases .

		To change the figure , the problems of aesthetic bear the same rela - tion to artistic products as do the mathematical solutions of strategetics to actual warfare .

		Wars may be waged , and poems and pictures made with - out conscious use of such underlying principles .

		But they are there and they determine the results .

		In the modern world , at least , artists have usually known what they were doing , and why .

		Goethe indeed said that he had never thought about think - ing , but there are many volumes of his art specula - tions to contradict him .

		The great problem of aesthetic is this : What is the relation of art to existence ?

		Is it an imitation ?

		Is it an interpretation ?

		Is it something added ?

		Is it a carryall of utility and morals ?

		Is it the univer - sal filtered through the human mind ?

		Is it the particulars of experience arranging themselves into a new order of life ?

		On our answers to such ques - tions depend our judgment of individual works of art .

		The two great philosophers of
Greece	LOCATION	gave a curiously different account of the origin and value of art .

		To Plato , himself a poet , artist , and creator of vital figures , art , or at least poetry , was a delud - ing lamp to men 's eyes and a snare to their feet !

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 257 It was inferior to shoemaking !

		It was a poor copy of the world which was itself only a paltry shadow of the Divine Ideas .

		Like Omar he would have burned all books , because if they resembled life they were unnecessary , and if they did not they were false .

		To Aristotle , on the other hand , crabbed logician , natural philosopher , Baconian before
Bacon	PERSON	as he was , art was the concentrated image of the best of real existence .

		He thought it could react in a moralistic way on man , and purify and exalt him .

		Hence he considered it about the highest and most important human concern .

		The word aesthetic is only of late application to the theory of the fine arts , and it is defined as the philosophy of the beautiful .

		As the Greek word from which it comes primarily means feeling or sensation , the narrowing of the derived term to sig - nify matters of beauty is rather singular , more especially as it was first so used during the romantic outburst of the last century .

		Certainly other things than the beautiful can give us feelings and sensa - tions even pleasurable ones .

		The ideal of Greek art may have been the regular , the harmonious , the perfect ; but even in Greek art what a wide range of creations , gorgons hydras and chimaeras dire , fell outside the limits of this ideal .

		Unless we can accept such conceptions as the perfection of horror , the delight fulness of the ugly , and the fascination of evil , we can not even explain Greek art .

		And Gothic or Romantic art may be said to wreak itself on the outre , the extravagant , the impossible , and the humanly imperfect .

		Modern or realistic art , rebelling from the abstract perfection of the Greek and the abstract imperfection of the Mediaeval Schools , has striven to be simply true .

		But truth without bias or selection is in art an impossibility and so what modern art has really done is to copy life in lower relief than it has itself .

		The commonplace good has become .

		the insipid and the commonplace evil has become the base .

		Both are wanting in the greatness with which the older schools of art endow them .

		But what I wish to remark is that beauty is not really the aim of any of these art methods .

		What the first two strive for is the characteristic , the significant , the effective .

		`` What the last thinks it is striving for is truth .

		As men are constituted I believe that their emotions and intellect tend to stagnate and stiffen , and that art is the most powerful agency to shock or startle them into motion , and make them realize the full - ness and vividness of existence .

		Things of beauty administer these shocks in rhythmical and harmoni - ous order , and so they charm .

		Things of power give them with sudden impetus and uncertain breaks , and so they fascinate .

		The great artists of the world wield both kinds of electricity .

		JEschylus is as romantic as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Shakespeare as classic as JEschylus .

		But the artist who deals in the commonplace and the inanely true does not yield us any shock at all , for his art is the essence of the stagnation in which we mainly dwell .

		As I have said ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristotle view art mainly from a moralistic standpoint .

		We moderns have tried to change all that .

		We have looked through the rose-colored spectacles of beauty and the reversed opera glass of intellectual indifference , but after all the thing we are regarding will not budge or alter .

		Art does deal overwhelmingly with moral ideas , deals with them as life itself deals with them for or against .

		Roughly speaking the gen - erations of the sons of men can be divided into generations of acquiescence and generations of re - volt .

		When authority is paramount , when the great issues of thought seem settled , when every - body is content with that station in life in which it pleased God he should be born , then we get a lit - erature like that of Cow per and
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		When the great deep of humanity is broken up and the whirlwind is abroad , we get an art like that of
Byron	PERSON	.

		We have late instances of these arts of peace and war .

		For half a century
Tenny	PERSON	- son charmed the world with his serene or but slightly troubled verse .

		He gave us what has been called the clerical idyll ; he announced the banns of quasi-science and the
Established Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was the Defender of Conservatism .

		`` Proputty , proputty , propntty , that 's what I ` ears him say . ''

		But discontent was stirring at his mild moralities and domestic virtues .

		And this discontent has drawn to a head in the prodigious vogue of
Fitz	PERSON	- gerald 's Omar .

		A good many people have won - dered at this vogue .

		Mere literary beauty does not explain it .

		Literary beauty never did explain any widespread popularity .

		Gray was half right when he said that the Elegy would have been just as popular if written in prose .

		But the Persian poem has matter in it .

		It is an expression of revolt .

		Not of violent revolt like that of
Byron	PERSON	's , but deep and hopeless .

		It is the doctrine of God damn .

		The ship of the world is sinking , so let 's get at the liquor room !

		It has seized upon and temporarily satisfied the needs of thinking minds .

		I do not wish to say that literary expression always follows or precedes a general mood of thought .

		That is
Taine	LOCATION	's rather cast-iron theory .

		No !

		Solitary voices for good or evil are always crying aloud in the world .

		Bat the measure of their acceptance is the mark of the tides of thought .

		The supreme artists , indeed , sum up both sides , and usually find some way of recon - ciliation .

		I have gone over two parts of the content of art images and morality .

		There is , I think , a third intellectual intuition .

		Or , in other words , art re - lates itself to concrete nature , or action , to the moral life , or character , and to the pure intellect .

		These three divisions correspond to the old names for the poet .

		He has been called the Maker , the Priest , and the Seer .

		In its highest reaches art is nothing less than revelation .

		The poet has gone up into the mountain and seen God .

		To speak in terms of philosophy , he has pierced beyond the phenomena of existence to the noumena to the thing in itself .

		And hence he sheds on mere phenomena a splendor and a radiance which is not their own .

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, So far for the subject matter of art .

		Now for its presentation .

		What is artistic perfection ?

		This is a somewhat analogous question to that of finish in painting , about which
Raskin	PERSON	has written some final pages .

		But a great many people who are willing to admit that the proper finish for a picture is the amount adequate to express the artist 's pur - pose , hesitate to carry the same principle into the consideration of literature .

		They expect an epic to have the faultlessness of a sonnet and a drama to be always on its best behavior and avoid low ways .

		The good Homer must never nod .

		Byron very sensibly said that there was no long poem in ex - istence the half of which was good .

		Of course he meant supremely good .

		Perfection itself is a matter of relatively and contrast .

		Where all is perfect nothing is known to be so .

		Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	remarks in one of his journals : '' How unequally a vral dire is Hamlet written . ''

		That is the judgment of a lyric technician .

		And
John Bright	PERSON	is said to have revolted at the changes of style in Shake - speare the alternation of high and low , the ad - mission of the humorous and the vulgar , and to have considered
Milton	PERSON	the greater poet because of the unvarying level of his work .

		Milton 's dignity comes largely from his subject , and when he has to deal with familiar facts in polysyllables there is in him at least a suspicion of that pomposity of which
Wordsworth	PERSON	was to be the awful example '' And at the Hoop alighted , famous inn . ''

		Homer certainly varies his manner .

		He does not attempt to give to
Ajax	ORGANIZATION	and
Diomede	PERSON	dining off of huge shins of beef the same splendor that he casts upon Apollo striding through the sky with the arrows rattling in the quiver on his back , or upon Achilles raising the grief-stricken Priam from the ground .

		And
Dante	PERSON	, too , relaxes the tight-strung bow of language , again and again .

		In the Inferno there is vulgarity , coarseness , bestiality .

		And in the Paradiso he is so intent upon his argument that he forgets to write poetry at all .

		The most pervad - ingly elegant and in the ordinary sense poetic part of his poem is the middle section .

		Here he does not have to deal with the powers of darkness or the domain of the brute , nor does he soar into regions where ecstasy is tuned to utterance beyond human recognition and so he can be equable and pure and perfect .

		But he is greatest elsewhere .

		Neces - sarily it is in the drama that the contest between the varied content of reality and an even ideal presentation is the sharpest .

		The old French tragic poets cut the question short by deciding that life must conform to art , that
Queens	LOCATION	, confidants , heroes , and servants must all talk in the same elegant and elevated strain , and passion and desolation and death wear the chains of an equal etiquette .

		Goethe in his later years came to adhere to this method under the persuasion that he was following the Greeks .

		The poet who gave us
Auerbach	PERSON	's cellar and the domestic scenes in Egmont tried to turn
Romeo	LOCATION	and
Juliet	PERSON	into a perfect piece on this model .

		He smoothed out all the vulgarities and colloquial - isms , and made it as prettily insipid as a wool lamb .

		Fortunately we have in Shakespeare the ultimate power in the art of unity in contrast .

		He gives us just enough of commonness and coarseness to be a foil to his nobleness and perfection .

		What poems in the world are so bathed and fused in a single atmosphere as The Tempest or
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	,
Borneo	LOCATION	and
Juliet	PERSON	or Macbeth .

		And this brings me to my conclusion .

		I have questioned , tentatively indeed , the theory that would limit art to the beautiful .

		And indeed , its most powerful elements are such as , taken separately , horrify and terrorize and confuse .

		But in good art they never are taken separately .

		The artist leagues together his beauty and his ugliness , his shadows and his lights , his melodies and his discords , and gives us a whole which is calm in all its agitation .

		In it pain has become painless , evil innocuous , death immortal , and the transitory figures of joy and beauty are fixed in faultless form and unfading color .

		MISLEADING LIBRARY STATISTICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While library workers are gratified at the increased attention given library work and use , by students , critics , and writers , believing that , as a result of any public agitation , additional knowledge of these institutions will bring increased opportunities for good , they can not but object to the plan which seems to be so generally adopted , of measuring the work accomplished by the percentage of the different classes of books issued for home use .

		Writers in recent publications take the '' home use statistics '' of a number of prominent libra - ries , and because they find , from the circulation tables , that an average of three-fourths of the volumes so issued are classed under the heading of fiction , argue that it is questionable whether the public library is really a good thing for a community .

		It is unfortunate , perhaps , that library reports do not give the exact '' quality '' of fiction circulated ; that they do not say whether the library is closely classified or not ; whether a great many or a few titles are placed in fiction which properly belong in other classes ; whether juvenile fiction is placed under fiction pure and simple , or is reported under the general heading '' ju - venile books '' ; for without this information , and a few other things which will be here referred to , no one can accurately judge of the work being done by any given library .

		The main point , however , is the injustice done the library by the attempt to measure its value to a com - munity solely by the books issued for home reading .

		A visit to any library of considerable size will reveal the fact that most of the real work is done in the library rooms ; that for every book other than fiction taken home , from eight to fifteen will be used in the building ; and that in certain seasons , and especially in educational centres , this proportion will be largely increased .

		This is true especially of the library small in comparison with the population of the city in which it is located
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 and with limited means this latter a condition all bat chronic west of the
Allegheny	LOCATION	mountains .

		A large proportion of this use of books in the library is com - pulsory -LRB- if they are to be used at all -RRB- , for various rea - sons , chief among which is the inability of the library to supply a sufficient number of copies of a given book or to provide enough other works upon the same sub - ject to meet a large but temporary demand .

		For in - stance , a study club with an extensive membership , or a high school or college class , is given a subject to look up , with references to comparatively few volumes .

		The library could increase the '' home circulation '' of books other than fiction by issuing these few volumes to the first comers of either the club or the class , while the other , for various reasons , later applicants at the library would be deprived of the use of any of them .

		The rule in most of these libraries , in these emergencies , is to reserve these volumes for use in the library , on the basis of '' the greatest good for the greatest number . ''

		With a number of such clubs and classes , one may readily see how a library could change its circulation statistics if it would .

		Again , these libraries , unable to purchase more than one copy of valuable works or one set of periodicals , place them in the reference room for use in the library exclusively , where no record is kept of their use , these rooms and shelves usually being open to the public .

		Here at times they have a wonderfully extensive use .

		Thus , a library of 25,000 volumes in a city of 100,000 inhabitants may be doing a large amount of commend - able work , of lasting value to a community , while its published statistics may show a '' home use '' of more than 80 per cent fiction .

		Another library of 75,000 volumes in a similar city may not be doing any better work , yet its home circulation may be but 60 per cent fiction , or less .

		Figures are often more than misleading , but in noth - ing else so much as in so-called '' library statistics . ''

		A FINAL WORD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL .

		I In your issue of
March 16	DATE	, there appeared from the pen of Mr.
A. L. Day	PERSON	a short letter which gave me three addresses I might write to and gain further in - formation on the subject of county libraries .

		In your issue of
April 1	DATE	, Mr.
W. T. Porter	PERSON	has a letter advanc - ing the claim of the
Cincinnati Library	LOCATION	to priority in the matter of inaugurating the county library move - ment .

		Since reading these two letters , and collecting all available data , I still remain by my statement in my letter in THE DIAL of
January 16	DATE	that the
Brum	PERSON	- back Library of
Van Wert County	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, is
America	LOCATION	's first real county library .

		The
Xorris Jewett Library	ORGANIZATION	, to which Mr.
Day	PERSON	re - ferred in his letter , is far from being a county library .

		The latest catalogue , which lies before me , makes the simple statement that the
Norris Jewett Library	ORGANIZATION	is a library whose privileges are extended to all the resi - dents of
Grundy County	LOCATION	,
Mo.	LOCATION	.

		No law makes it a county library , no county tax supports it , and no sys - tem of branch libraries has been put into operation by it .

		It will take a little more space to show that the Cin - cinnati Library is likewise , strictly speaking , hardly a county library .

		Granting , however , that it is a county library , let me briefly consider the act that created it a county library as well as the act that created the Brnm - back Library of
Van Wert County	LOCATION	a county library .

		Library BUI of the
Cincin	PERSON	- I Library Bill of the

House	ORGANIZATION	:
April 21 , 1898	DATE	, Passed .


April 15 , 1898	DATE	, Introduced ;
April 26 , 1898	DATE	, Passed .

		We thus see that the bill of the
Brumback Library of Van Wert County	ORGANIZATION	was introduced first , and passed the senate before the bill of the
Cincinnati Library	ORGANIZATION	passed either the senate or the house .

		In this connection I should like to add that the bill of the
Brumback Library	ORGANIZATION	was published in four or five of
Ohio	LOCATION	's leading papers nearly two months before the bill of the
Cincin	PERSON	- nati Library was introduced in the
Ohio	LOCATION	legislature .

		See , for example , '' The Commercial Tribune '' of Cin - cinnati , for
Feb. 13 , 1898	DATE	.

		I have given a brief history of the two bills .

		Let me next say a word regarding their contents .

		Again I will place my facts side by side .

		Bill of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Li - Bill of the
Brumback Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- Called a special brary of
Van Wert County	LOCATION	, act , since it applies practic - ally only to the
Cincinnati Library	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Tax is levied on the county , not by county officials , but by trustees of the library .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Phrase `` county library '' does not appear in the bill .

		From the preceding facts we see that , strictly speak - ing , the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	act does not create a county library .

		It simply extends the privileges of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Li - brary to
Hamilton County	LOCATION	.

		The fact is , the
Cincinnati Library	LOCATION	is more like the libraries in several of our larger cities , which have elaborate systems of branch libraries , than a county library in a county with a rural population , since the corporate limits of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	are almost coextensive with the lines of
Hamilton County	LOCATION	.

		What Mr.
Porter	PERSON	says regarding the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Li - brary having been put into operation first is all true .

		The
Brumback Library	ORGANIZATION	had to be built after the passage of its act .

		The
Cincinnati Library	LOCATION	was already built .

		The only claim made by the
Brumback Library of Van Wert County	ORGANIZATION	is that it teas the first to inaugurate the county library movement .

		The title of this work is to be taken literally , for each entry deals , not with the bibliography of a subject , but with the bibliographies of that subject .

		It requires some effort to grasp this idea , but less than the effort that will be required , at some future time , to grasp the idea of a '' Bibliography of Bibliographies of Bibliographies '' with the work now before us as the pioneer production of its class .

		THE BEGINNINGS OP A FAMOUS CAREER .

		* Professor
Max Muller	PERSON	's autobiography is a fragment that takes us little beyond the thresh - old of his career , namely , into the early days at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and not out of the period during which Sanskrit was his sole pursuit .

		But it is an important fragment biographically , since it deals with a portion of the writer 's life rela - tively little known , and shows how and why the current of his career and work first took the direction it did .


Friedrich Max Miiller	PERSON	was born on
Dec. 6 , 1823	DATE	, in the ducal town of
Dessau	LOCATION	in
Central Germany	LOCATION	.

		His father ,
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	, libra - rian at
Dessau	LOCATION	, was one of the most popular poets of
Germany	LOCATION	hardly one of the greatest , perhaps , though
Heine	PERSON	ranked his lyrics second only to
Goethe 's	ORGANIZATION	, and we find that in the critical anthology of Echtermeyer sixteen pieces of his are given , which is a large quota relatively .

		At the age of thirty-three
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	died , leaving but scanty provision for his widow , '' fabulously '' so , his son says , when one con - siders that she had to bring up two children on it .

		But even aside from the stress of the res angusta domi , life seems to have been rather a sad affair for the fatherless little ones at the Miiller home .

		For years it was a house of mourning , the widow nursing her grief with a pious if inconsiderate constancy that cast a pall over the lives of her children .

		Miiller says : '' All I remember of my mother at that time was that she took her two children day after day to the beautiful Gottesacker -LRB- God 's Acre -RRB- , where she stood for hours at our father 's grave , and sobbed and cried .

		It was a beautiful and restful place , covered with old acacia trees .

		The inscription over the gateway was one of my earliest puzzles : Tod ist nicht Tod , ist nur Ver - edlung menschlicher Natur -LRB- Death is not death , 't is but the ennobling of man 's nature -RRB- ... When my mother said she wished to die , and to be with our father , I feel sure that my sister and I were only anxious that she should take us with her , for there were few golden chains that bound us as yet to this life . ''

		Passing by the author 's pleasant chapter on
Dessau	LOCATION	life and manners , over which the re - viewer is tempted to linger , we find that at twelve he was sent to the famous Nicolai-Schule at
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		The school was then under Dr.
Nobbe	PERSON	-LRB- known in
England	LOCATION	through his edition of Cicero -RRB- , and it had an excellent staff of masters , among them
Palm	LOCATION	, Forbiger , and * MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY : A FRAGMENT .

		Funkhanel , sound classical scholars all , and men of more than national reputation .

		Clas - sical studies were naturally given the prece - dence at the Nicolai-Schule , all else , modern languages , mathematics , physics , etc. , having comparatively a poor chance of it .

		While the author , as he says , '' liked his classics , '' and went as in duty bound into the stock raptures '' about Homer and Sophocles , about
Horace and Cicero	PERSON	, '' he was nevertheless haunted by the suspicion that there was a tinge of cant in the praises lavished by the masters on the old authors at the expense of the new . ''

		The exaggeration in the panegyrics passed on everything Greek or Latin dates from the classical scholars of the Middle Ages , who knew nothing that could be compared to the classics , and who were loutl in praising what they possessed the monopoly of selling .

		Successive generations of scholars followed suit , so that even in our time it seemed high treason to compare Goethe with
Horace	PERSON	, or
Schiller	PERSON	with Sophocles . ''

		In
1841	DATE	the author left the Nicolai-Schule , and soon after passed his examination for ad - mission to
Leipzig University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had deter - mined to study philology , chiefly Greek and Latin ; but , delighted as he was with such guides and teachers as Professors
Hermann	PERSON	and
Haupt	PERSON	, he found little in the chiefly critical work assigned him to rouse his enthusiasm .

		Everything , he felt , had already been done , and there was no virgin soil left on which to try one 's own spade .

		So , dissatisfied with what seemed a mere chewing of the cud in Greek and Latin , he betook himself to systematic .

		philosophy , joining the philosophical societies of
Weisse	ORGANIZATION	,
Drobisch	LOCATION	, and
Lotze	PERSON	.

		For a time he dreamed of becoming a philosopher , and it was while indulging in this dream that he began to feel that he must know something special , something that no other philosopher knew ; and thus his thoughts gradually turned to Sanskrit as to a key to the possible infinite riches of systems yet little known to the think - ers of the
West	LOCATION	.

		He had read the explanatory and somewhat fanciful books on the speech and philosophy of
India	LOCATION	by
Schlegel	PERSON	and Win - dischmann , and these , he says , '' had left on me , as they did on many , that feeling which the digger who prospects for minerals is said to have , that there must be gold beneath the surface , if people would only dig . ''

		The needed impulse to the latent inclination came with the founding at
Leipzig	LOCATION	of the new professorship of Sanskrit , which was given to Professor
Brockhaus	PERSON	.


Max Miiller	PERSON	then determined to see what there was to be learnt in
Sanskrit	LOCATION	, and to , gratify , he admits , his desire to study
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 something which his friends and fellow-students did not know .

		Calling upon
Brockhaus	PERSON	he found that there were then but two students besides himself who cared to attend the new lectures , for the prejudice against Sanskrit was still strong among classical scholars , although among those who stood up for it were men like von Humboldt and the two von Schlegels .

		The author confesses that the champions of the new learning gave vent in their first enthusiasm to many exaggerated opinions . ''

		Sanskrit was represented as the mother of all lan - guages , instead of being the elder sister of the Aryan family .

		The beginning of all language , of all thought , of all religion , was traced back to
India	LOCATION	, and when Greek scholars were told that Zeus existed in the Veda under the name of Dyaus there was a great flutter in the dovecotes of classical scholarship .

		Many of these en - thusiastic utterances had afterwards to be toned down . ''

		The author 's zeal for his new studies met with small encouragement at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and he had to be chary of his supposed Sanskritist heresies in the seminary of Gottfried Her - mann , or in the Latin society of
Haupt	PERSON	in the latter particularly , for
Hermann	PERSON	saw there was a new light and refused to obstruct it .

		In him learning begot a liberality that is not always its offspring .

		Hermann saw that the verbal coincidences between Greek and Sans - krit could not be casual , and made generous concessions to the new learning .

		He did not discourage Miiller -LRB- as his colleagues probably did -RRB- when he determined in his third year at
Leipzig	LOCATION	to go to
Berlin	LOCATION	to hear
Bopp	PERSON	.

		After some nine months at
Berlin	LOCATION	the author went to
Paris	LOCATION	, and his stay there , from
March , 1845	DATE	, to
June , 1846	DATE	, proved a useful inter - mezzo as well as a main factor in determining his future career .

		His object in going to
Paris	LOCATION	was of course largely to hear
Burnouf	PERSON	, then lecturing to a select class at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	on Indian philosophy and religion .

		Bnrnouf , a charming man and a fine specimen of the real French savant , encouraged the young German scholar in every way , lent him his own
Vedic MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		to copy -LRB- when the great edition of the Rig-veda was , at
Burnouf	ORGANIZATION	's in - stance , really begun -RRB- , guided him to the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		at the
Bibliotbeque Royale	ORGANIZATION	, and , what was then of no small moment , cheered his droopiug spirits at times when the patent difficulty of finding a publisher for his huge and commer - cially unpromising forthcoming work loomed large and disheartening .

		`` The commentary must be published , depend upon it , and it will be , '' said the cheery Frenchman , and so the drudgery of copying and collating went on .

		Ordinary copying is dreary work , but copying Sanskrit for hours at a stretch from manu - script , was deadly .

		Mistakes were inevitable under the usual process of transcribing , so a new one had to be invented . ''

		This new process , '' says the author , '' I discovered by using transparent paper , and thus tracing every let - ter .

		I had some excellent papier vegetal made for me , and , instead of copying , traced the whole Sanskrit MS. '' As the work progressed the question of a publisher tended to become the engrossing one .

		An effort by Humboldt to secure the aid of the
King of Prussia	LOCATION	in the enterprise came to nought , as did a rather vague and imprac - ticable offer from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, which Bur - nouf advised the author not to accept .

		The solution of the problem was brought about in a rather fortuitous way during a visit of Miiller to
England	LOCATION	.

		He had long felt the necessity of making a trip to
London	LOCATION	in order to copy and collate some
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		which were in the Li - brary of the
East India	LOCATION	Company , but had lacked funds for the journey .

		In
June , 1846	DATE	, he was enabled to start , and on arriving at
London	LOCATION	he at once began work in the Com - pany 's library in Leadenhall Street .

		He had been employed there for nearly a month when it occurred to him that he ought to call upon the Prussian Minister ,
Baron Bunsen	PERSON	.

		The visit proved the turning-point of his life .

		He found in the Baron a friend , a social sponsor , and , what was practically most important , a fellow-Sanskritist who as a young man had proposed to himself as the work of his life the very task upon which he ,
Miiller	PERSON	, was engaged , namely , the editio princeps of the Rig-veda .

		Drifting into diplomacy , the
Baron	PERSON	had given up his early design ; but he at once warmly entered into
Miiller	PERSON	's project , and his interest happily took a practical turn .

		He saw that the
East India	LOCATION	Company was the proper body to publish the work .

		It was of course no easy task to get the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	all keen and practical men of business to authorize the printing , at great expense , in six volumes quarto of a thousand pages each , of an old book that none of them could understand , and many of them had never even heard of .

		But Bunsen 's name was a power in
England	LOCATION	, and his efforts were ably seconded by Professor
Wilson	PERSON	, the Librarian of the Company ; so that it was at last settled that the
East India	LOCATION	Company was to bear the cost of the printing of the Veda , and to defray the editor 's expenses while the work was preparing for the press .

		The financial difficulty thus settled , the rest 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, was comparatively plain sailing for Miiller .

		It was decided that the !

		Rig-veda should be printed at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and thither the editor con - cluded to migrate .

		His first visit there had filled him with enthusiasm for the beautiful old town , where , as he says , '' even the under - graduates , dressed in their mediaeval academic costume , looked to me very grand , and so dif - ferent from the German students at
Leipzig	LOCATION	or still more at
Jena	LOCATION	, walking about the streets in pink cotton trousers and dressing-gowns . ''

		It is pleasant to note that
Miiller	PERSON	was deeply impressed with the '' real friendliness '' shown him , an unknown German scholar , at
Oxford	LOCATION	; but the idea of settling permanently at that '' academic paradise '' did not for some time occur to him . ''

		I was there to print my Rig-veda and work at the Bodleian ; that I should in a few years be an
M.A. of Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, a Fellow of the most exclusive of col - leges , nay , a married Fellow a being not even in - vented then and a professor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, never entered into my wildest dreams . ''

		Reminiscences , in the vein of the author 's pleasant volumes on ''
Auld Lang Syne	PERSON	, '' of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and Oxonians in early days , form the staple of the two closing chapters of the Auto - biography .

		Among the early friends at Ox - ford of whom mention is made is
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Says the author : '' It strikes one that while he was at
Oxford	LOCATION	, few people only detected in
Arnold	LOCATION	the poet or the man of remarkable genius ... Then suddenly came the time when he returned to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	as the poet , as the professor of poetry , nay , afterwards as the philosopher also , placed high by public opinion among the living worthies of
England	LOCATION	.

		What was sometimes against him was his want of seriousness .

		A laugh from his hearers or readers seemed to be more valued by him than their serious opposition , or their convinced assent .

		He trusted , like others , to persiflage , and the result was that when he tried to be serious , people could not for - get that he might at any time turn round and smile , and decline to be taken au grand serieux . ''

		The view of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as an incurable persifleur seems to us a rather novel and not wholly sound one .

		To banter , indeed , he was sometimes given ; and everyone knows how effectively he used to rally that peculiarly im - pervious and self-satisfied class of his country - men devoted , he thought , mainly to chapels , business , tea-meetings , comfort , and the phil - osophy of Sir
Daniel Gooch	PERSON	.

		But if it be true , as we suppose it is in a measure , that - people declined to take
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	quite seri - ously , was it not rather because the social remedies he preached seemed to them ludi - crously disproportionate to the ills he proposed to cure ? ''

		One does not , '' says
Danton	PERSON	, '' make revolutions with rose-water '' ; and so Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's faith in the saving efficacy of culture may well have seemed to sterner spirits , as he admitted , '' a religion proposing parma - ceti , or some scented salve or other , as a cure for human miseries . ''

		The editor of the Autobiography , Mr.
W. G. Max Miiller	PERSON	, has acquitted himself well in the plainly difficult task of putting in shape the fragments and jottings at his disposal .

		Much of the matter was written or dictated during the last weeks of the author 's life , his desire being to leave as much as possible ready for publication .

		That the end came so soon no reader of this cheery record of the morning of a changeful and bustling , if studious , life will fail to regret .

		E. G. J .

		THE STORM AND STRESS IN THE BLACK WORLD .

		* From the dark world beyond the Color-line come usually only faint murmurs to the world without so faint that some deny altogether to this world , word and thought .

		But now and then there comes a wild discordant note , which sets men wondering not so much at the words said as at the pitch and passion of the cry .

		So it is with Mr.
Hannibal Thomas	PERSON	's '' The American Negro . ''

		The voice of a Negro talking of Negroes has not yet ceased sounding unusual to our ears .

		The actual content of his message is of no great intrinsic importance ; there is some history of the encyclopaedic order , many general observations showing thought and reading , and passing evidence of eccentric originality and no little ability .

		THE DIAL 263 den that is threatening to overtax their strength , and the foreshadowing of the age of revolt .

		The
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	is still as a race too hopeful of his future , and able to point out too many undeniable evidences of progress , to harbor as yet any well defined thoughts of spiritual or physical revolt .

		And yet among the incompetent , the impatient , and the dis - appointed among those black men who al - ready in the severe struggle for existence have fallen by the wayside , the sinister types that war with society are beginning to appear : the ignorant contemner of law and order , and the sly deceiver ; and the better trained man who has lost faith either in the coming of the Good or in the Good itself .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	is peculiarly the type of the Negro cynic .

		He may speak of virtue , and interlard a few general phrases of goodness and hope , but they are lost in his general des - pair , they have a hollow , unreal sound beside the rest of his words .

		At bottom his book is without faith or ideal .

		He is one of those embodied disappointments of Reconstruction times ; one who went South to show the World and the Negro how to do everything in a day , and succeeded only in shattering his ideals , and becoming embittered and dissatisfied with men .

		Wandering from place to place and from occupation to occupation , he finally set - tled in
Boston	LOCATION	, where in
1890	DATE	he published a pamphlet * which now , re-written , appears as '' The American Negro . ''

		This pamphlet fell unnoticed from the press , and the inner striv - ings of the Negro people soon lost him what influence he had possessed among them .

		The new spiritual longings of the Negro , and the outreaching for real progress , has de - veloped in the last decade a higher type of race leadership than formerly , and ousted many of the demagogues and rascals .

		A new race literature of promise has appeared , and a race consciousness such as the modern world has never before seen among black folk .

		These results have been bitterly resented by many men , and it seems to be this resentment that has caused Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's pamphlet of
1890	DATE	to be re - written for the book of
1901	DATE	.

		The pamphlet was a defense of the Negro , with severe criticisms on the whites , and laid down the thesis that land owning and education both industrial and higher would solve the Negro problems .

		cisms on the whites were toned down , and then with a sort of cool ferocity , without pity or re - straint , there was added a denunciation of the Negro in
America	LOCATION	unparalleled in vindictive - ness and exaggeration .

		The result is natur ally a contradictory book , for alongside the new anathemas lie the old schemes for ameli - oration and grounds for hope .

		Many passages illustrate this , but perhaps two will suffice : THOMAS nr 1890 : '' I venture the opinion that of those who descant so glibly on Negro inferiority , not one has an accurate knowledge of facts on the social side of his life .

		... I take it upon my - self , therefore , to say that a considerate investigation through personal contact will disclose as much of the sa - credness of living , as scrupu - lous regard for truth and virginal honor , as keen an appreciation , and as much of the practice of Christian in - tegrity , with as intimate a familiarity with the best lit - erature and the highest forms of civilization , whenever op - portunity permits , as charac - terizes the more pretentious white race '' -LRB- pp. 7 , 8 -RRB- .

		`` Therefore it may be frankly and fearlessly said that the Negro when honestly measured through the amen - ities of social contact , either in the industrial department or intellectual field , dispels much of the false knowledge with which an unreasoning prejudice has invested him .

		... Studied in the light of his past , I think it will be found that he has no greater virtues nor grosser vices than are common to other races of mankind , and like them in manhood true and good , in - telligent and upright '' -LRB- pp. 8 , 9 -RRB- .

		THOMAS IN
1901	DATE	: `` In fact I doubt if any white person lives who has an adequate comprehension of Negro characteristics , not - withstanding the many who descant so glibly on the pres - ent and future of the freed people '' < p. xix .

		i. '' Soberly speaking , Negro nature is so craven and sen - suous in every fibre of its being that a Negro manhood with decent respect for chaste womanhood does not exist '' -LRB- p. 180 -RRB- . ''

		Fully 90 per cent , of the Negro women of
America	LOCATION	-LSB- are -RSB- lascivious by instinct , and in bondage to physical pleasure ... The social degradation of our freed women is without a parallel in modern civilization '' -LRB- p. 195 -RRB- . ''

		... We may take the word virtue , whose exact sig - nificance no Negro compre - hends who fails therefore to engraft its import into the fibre of his being ... The same is true of the words like truth , honor , and integ - rity .

		These are meaningless expressions , and because the Negro can not connect words with ideas and ideas with realities , he lies with avidions readiness without undergoing the slightest remorse , and often without any apparent sense of prevarication '' -LRB- p. 118 -RRB- .

		It is , of course , conceivable that a man should utterly change his opinions in ten years ; but when opinions formed after twenty-five years of close contact with actual conditions are radically altered after ten years ' absence from those conditions , the later testimony is certainly less valuable than the earlier .

		And when , too , this conversion is marred by so evi - dent bitterness and recklessness , and when one remembers that the writer himself is a Negro , born of a Negro mother , then his book can only be explained as a rare exhibition of that contempt for themselves which some Ne - groes still hold as a heritage of the past .

		Before such an attack as this , nine millions 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of human beings stand helpless .

		The swift defense which social groups have ever exer - cised against the malignor is not theirs to wield .

		They can not edit the things said about them as can other races and people .

		But it is possible for the most discredited of their race to gain now and then by singular accident and the exigencies of the book market , respectful hearing and wide advertisement .

		One dis - couraging cause of this , is the more or less un - conscious Wish for the Worst in regard to the Negro , to satisfy the logic of his anomalous situation .

		If the Negro will kindly go to the devil and make haste about it , then the Amer - ican conscience can justify three centuries of shameful history ; and hence the subdued en - thusiasm which greets a sensational article or book that proves all Negroes worthless .

		All men know that the
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	is ignorant and poor , with criminal and immoral tendencies .

		And some of us know why .

		Never - theless the Negroes are not as ignorant as the Russians , nor as poor as the Irish , nor as crim - inal as the English and French workingmen , nor sexually as incontinent as the Italians .

		If there is hope for
Europe	LOCATION	there is abundant hope for the Negro .

		And if there is hope , then in the name of decency let the American people refuse to use their best agencies for publicity in distributing exaggerations and misrepresentations such as '' The American Negro . ''

		FACT AND FABL.E IN PSYCHOLOGY .

		* The optimistic scientist is wont to regard Occultism as a kind of feeble intellectual para - site , unfit to cope with the strenuous conditions of modern life and consequently doomed to speedy extinction .

		To the dispassionate ob - server , however , certain contemporary tenden - cies suggest in the surviving species of the occult a tenacity of life , which threatens a serious postponement of the scientific millen - ium .

		One certainly can not view such psychic epidemics , as the spread of Spiritualism during the years 1848-50 , and the wave of

		books .

		It is , therefore , a matter of no small importance to clear up the precise nature of the quarrel which science has with these move - ments , and to locate , if possible , the boundary line between knowledge and superstition , be - tween science and mysticism .

		Professor Jas - trow 's '' Fact and Fable in Psychology , '' which furnishes our text , is an admirable brief for the scientific side of this case .

		The general charge which science brings against Occultism , is that of ignorant contempt for the majesty of natural law .

		The cruder forms of Occultism , exemplified by some of the ebullitions of theosophists , are chiefly notable as evidences of colossal insensibility to fact .

		They have no more bearing on the real devel - opment of intelligence than have the delusional theories of the insane .

		The real controversy is with a much more masterful adversary .

		There is a considerable group of highly cul - tivated men , among them some conspicuous scientists , for whom scientific orthodoxy is tested not more by assent to the finality of such laws as science has already formulated , than by the maintenance of a catholic and open-minded attitude toward fresh knowledge , however revolutionary , in whose light the older principles may be newly interpreted .

		These men are the bitter enemies of intolerant dog - matism , whether it pose as science or as relig - ion , and they insist that science is nowadays guilty of intolerable bigotry in its refusal to countenance well-attested facts , simply because they are seemingly irreconcilable with accepted physical principles .

		Clearly the outcome of this protestant reac - tionary attitude of mind will depend altogether on the sobriety with which it is employed .

		Such a position may lead simply to an enlarge - ment of knowledge concerning the interrela - tions of different forces in the universe .

		But it is only a step to a totally different conse - quence , in the shape of a practical abandonment of belief in the inviolability of demonstrated uniformities in nature .

		Undoubtedly the rain descends upon the just and the unjust without regard to ethical decency , and no one 's faith is thereby disturbed .

		But if spirits can lift tables and hold them suspended in the air , in spite of the operation of gravity , then knowl - edge is at an end ; the whole fabric of science deliquesces into a mere logomachy , human con - duct degenerates into a gambling upon chance , and man himself becomes the plaything of every eddy that may happen to roil the waters of his ignorance .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 No amount of juggling with the ancient theological device for explaining the miracu - lous will , the scientist insists , do away with this dilemma .

		If , in such a case as that of our illustration , one speaks of the operation of a higher law , which somehow transcends tempo - rarily the law of gravity , one of two things is meant : either some force other than gravity , say magnetism , has momentarily obscured the apparent operation of gravity and this is wholly conformable to the strictest conception of immutability in natural law , or gravity is not an invariable principle displayed in the relations of masses to one another .

		The latter alternative , if true , annihilates science .

		Naturally the advocates of liberalism in this controversy would resent the name Occultism as applied to them .

		They are nothing , if not defenders of the idea of law .

		They contend , however , for the whole law , and protest against identifying with this whole the trivial segment which physical science , with its mechanical conceptions , has thus far succeeded in decipher - ing .

		But in actual practice much of their pro- cedure becomes indistinguishable from that of the genuine occultist , because they are ready to recognize causes unknown to science -LRB- e. g. ^ telepathy -RRB- in explanation of phenomena which scientists regard as partially spurious , and in the remaining instances as entirely explicable upon the basis of accepted principles .

		In almost every instance the real controversy will be found to reduce itself to the question of whether the operations of physical forces are ever modified or suspended by non-physical agencies .

		This issue is raised in connection with spiritualism , mesmerism ,
Christian Sci	ORGANIZATION	- ence , necromancy , telepathy , clairvoyance , etc. .

		Did the liberalists mean by their agencies -LRB- as , for instance , telepathy -RRB- simply some hitherto unidentified physical process , such as the
Roentgen	PERSON	ray , the present dispute would never have arisen .

		Unfortunately , so far as concerns the preservation of the peace , this is not the case with most of them .

		To compromise with this mood is , the scientist maintains , to barter the birthright of one 's rationality for the pot - tage of lunacy .

		Probably no one in
America	LOCATION	has done more than Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	to disarm the common forms of Occultism of their more pernicious consequences .

		He has made himself widely known as a lucid and vigorous essayist , whose forceful expositions of the conservative scien - tific attitude on such subjects as we have been discussing have won him a well-merited repute .

		In his present volume he has gathered together eleven of his previously published papers , sub - mitting them to a careful revision , which in one or two instances amounts to a re-writing .

		The articulation of the several members of the series is much more successful than commonly occurs in books made up in this fashion .

		An admirable essay on the Modern Occult , canvassing theosophy ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , stands first in the series and sounds the key - note of the whole book .

		This is followed by a somewhat drastic criticism of the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, and a depreciatory esti - mate of the results and future possibilities of such work .

		Mr.
Jastrow	PERSON	gives the devil his due in acknowledging the accumulation by this organization of much valuable psychological material , but the balance sheet still shows , in his opinion , a heavy deficit by reason of the damage done by the Society to the psycholo - gist 's scientific reputation .

		An examination of mental telegraphy , issuing in a conclusion of its probably fictitious character , is fittingly followed by a description of the psychology of deception , as illustrated by the conjurer and the ordinary medium .

		An essay upon invol - untary muscular movements , including a dis - cussion of muscle-reading , is closely connected in subject matter with the last mentioned papers , although given a later position in the volume .

		Spiritualism and hypnotism each receive scholarly treatment , partly historical and partly analytical .

		An entertaining paper on mental prepossession is in many ways inti - mately connected with the second of these topics .

		The dreams of the blind are ably dis - cussed , although the subject seems a trifle aside from the main stream of the essays .

		Probably the least important of the chapters is upon the mind 's eye , under which title the familiarities of the psychological texts upon perception and illusion are briefly set forth .

		An extremely able paper upon argument from analogy furnishes in a sense the logical ful - crum of the whole volume and completes the list of essays .

		Taken in its entirety , Mr.
Jastrow	PERSON	's argu - ment consists in showing how strange and baffling phenomena , for whose explanation supernatural causes have been invoked , have one after another been reduced to cases of in - telligible and often familiar occurrences dis - torted by mal-observation and defective reason - ing .

		It is of course impossible in any brief resume to convey a just impression of the cumulative force of an argument of this type , 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, when applied successively to the several groups of phenomena which have afforded occasion for the majority of supernaturalistic hypotheses .

		Suffice it to say , the achievement is thoroughly skilful , and Mr.
Jastrow	PERSON	's book may be safely prescribed in large doses for all cases of in - cipient occultism .

		The moral , as well as the intellectual , advantages of scientific conserva - tism are made abundantly evident .

		But to the end , temperamental rather than purely logical considerations will doubtless determine the attitude toward these problems of many pre - sumably intelligent persons .

		There are , more - over , profounder forms of mysticism than any of these with which Mr.
Jastrow	PERSON	has chosen to deal .

		They contain , however , no serious menace to science , and their omission is accordingly justifiable .

		CHAPTERS FROM
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	HISTORY .

		* In no line of historical writing has there been such marked advancement in recent years as in '' state '' histories .

		Formerly the term meant a series of reminiscences of early comers in which tradition , anecdote , and a thousand trifling details occupied the place of leading facts , logical development , and scholarly deduc - tions .

		Or it meant a '' guide for emigrants , '' giving a kind of encyclopaedic summary , which grew into a subscription book , with a number of plates of important personages at so much per plate .

		Only too rarely has the scholarly business man had the zeal to turn aside and enter a field which has no special attraction for the professional historical writer .

		Such a man was the late
Edward G. Mason	PERSON	, for some time President of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and to whom that institution owes much of its present flourishing condition .

		Although only an adopted citizen of
Illinois	LOCATION	, having been born in
Connecticut	LOCATION	and educated at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, he entered upon a special study of the early days in the
Illinois	LOCATION	country with a zest and a training which made him an authority upon that topic .

		His enthusiasm has placed in the
Chicago	LOCATION	His - torical Society many priceless records which would otherwise have gone the primrose way of their fellows to destruction .

		It was the purpose of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	to write a scholarly history of
Illinois	LOCATION	one which should go to original sources for material , should be * CHAPTERS FROM

		readable , and which should eliminate entirely the commercial phases of the subscription his - tory .

		This high purpose was cut short by his untimely death , and finds but a sad kind of fulfillment in the present posthumous work en - titled '' Chapters from
Illinois History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		One of the shorter chapters , ''
Illinois	LOCATION	in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' consists of a description of the beginnings of American rule in
Illinois	LOCATION	under Colonel
John Todd	PERSON	, who became Vir - ginia governor after the conquest by
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	.

		A second sketch is an excellent description of a personal visit to old
Fort Chartres	LOCATION	near the
Mississippi	LOCATION	below
St. Louis	LOCATION	, in which the ruins are rebuilt in the author 's fancy and re-peopled by
Makarty	ORGANIZATION	,
Renault	ORGANIZATION	, and the early French .

		The chapter on '' The
March	DATE	of the Spanish Across
Illinois	LOCATION	'' is a plausible argument that this expedition from
Spanish St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1781	DATE	, against the English at
St. Joseph	ORGANIZATION	, was intended to aid in the Span - ish claim to the country east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	when negotiations to close the Revolutionary War should be entered upon .

		Two lesser chapters , '' Illinois in the Revolution '' and `` The Chicago Massacre '' -LRB- of 1812 -RRB- , are suf - ficiently described in their titles .

		Two of the five chapters named above were previously printed , and the whole would no - doubt have been incorporated in the finished work .

		They are fragmentary .

		But the first `` chapter '' of the book , `` The Land of the
Illinois	LOCATION	, '' is of sufficient length to manifest the literary style , the thoroughness of detail , and the balance of topics , which would have char - acterized the whole had the original plan been carried out .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	begins with the reference by Champlain on his map to '' a nation where there is a quantity of buffalo , '' as indicating the land of the
Illinois Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thence the story is carried forward through
Marquette	LOCATION	, who the author thinks receives the credit nat - urally belonging to
Jolliet	LOCATION	; through the heroic achievements of
LaSalle	ORGANIZATION	and
Tonty	ORGANIZATION	, to the death of the former .

		The recital closes ab - ruptly with the reappointment of Frontenac as governor of
Canada	LOCATION	in
1689	DATE	.

		The sudden death of the author in his prime has a sad parallel in this sudden termination of the story in the height of its excellence .

		The enthusiasm of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	over the stirring deeds of
LaSalle	ORGANIZATION	and his great lieutenant is evident in every line .

		He leaves Tonty , gov - ernor of his lofty

		His array of references is at first startling , and then begets confidence .

		Where authorities differ , he has weighed the arguments with the training of the lawyer .

		The style is plain but the composition faultless .

		The purpose evidently is to convey the meaning to the reader with a view to the '' economy of attention . ''

		Of the many writings upon
Illinois	LOCATION	history , it is probably safe to say that none is so scholarly , so careful , and so trustworthy as these '' chapters '' from the pen of Mr.

		BUDDHISM , TRUE AND FALSE .

		* Suppose that in this day and age of the world a '' life of Jesus '' should be written , pur - porting to be a veritable history , and based on the so-called Apocryphal Gospels and similar authorities .

		Suppose , further , that the latter part of this * ' life '' should be taken up with an argument , buttressed by citations , to prove that
Mohammedanism	PERSON	was really a complete plagiarism of Christianity .

		Of equal scientific value and of a similar type of content is Mr.
Arthur Lillie	PERSON	's `` Buddha and Buddhism , '' a new volume in the series of '' The World 's Epoch Makers . ''

		What is presented as a '' life '' of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	is taken largely , without hint of the character of the sources , from the highly poetical , fanciful , and legendary stories about
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	contained in the late northern litera - ture .

		The story is told for the most part in a series of independent paragraphs whose primary aim is to show how similar to incidents in the life of Jesus are certain events in

		that Jesus was an Essene .

		The mode of argu - ment is illustrated by the following remarks : '' Historical questions are sometimes made more clear by being treated broadly .

		Let us first deal with this from the impersonal side , leaving out altogether the alleged words and deeds of
Christ	LOCATION	,
Paul	PERSON	, etc. '' -LRB- p. 159 -RRB- .

		In other words , Mr.
Lillie	PERSON	instead of giving a clear and scientific narrative of what is really known about
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and stating frankly the charac - ter and value of his authorities early and late a piece of work much to be desired , has produced a polemic maintaining that
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , posing as the religion of Jesus , is really a wholesale plagiarism from Buddhism .

		The book is no more than a rehash of the author 's previous writings on the same subject , and is of like importance .

		A strange coincidence has brought together in the same year this amorphous book of Mr.
Lillie	PERSON	, and a treatise on the same subject by Dr.
C. F. Aiken	PERSON	, in which the desirable and serviceable about Buddha and his system have been said with clearness , accuracy , and sobri - ety .

		The title is badly chosen , and will frighten off the very persons who would profit most by reading the book .

		The treatment is in three parts , first , a discussion of the relation of Buddhism to the antecedent Brahmanism ; second , the presentation of the system itself in its historical development , containing a chapter on
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's life from the earliest and most trustworthy sources ; third , an examination of the alleged relations of Buddhism with
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		In view of the unfounded assertions on this last topic in Mr.
Lillie	PERSON	's work , the third part makes very interesting and profitable read - ing .

		The author takes up with painstaking thoroughness and unwearied pursuit of details the various and devious allegations of the school to which Mr.
Lillie	PERSON	belongs , with the result anticipated , indeed , but none the less satisfactory that these writers are convicted of misrepresentations , garbled quotations , an - achronisms , and '' fictions '' -LRB- to use Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	's mild term -RRB- .

		It is almost incredible that writers claiming to be scientific scholars could be guilty of such charges , but ample proof is given in the course of this critical and unsparing exam - ination .

		The argument amounts to a demon - stration .

		Dr.
Aiken	PERSON	has rendered a service to Christianity , but , beyond that , he has made a notable contribution to the cause of sound learning and scientific truth .

		He has added , besides , a valuable bibliography of Buddhist texts and modern treatises .

		268 THE DIAL -LSB-

		It illustrates the keenness of thinking characteristic of the best Buddhist treatises .

		The style is repetitious and dreary .

		The faith which is inculcated rests upon knowledge of a very complicated and subtle system of philosophy .

		The translator has put every student of Buddhism into his debt by making this work available and annotating it with such care and intelligence .

		Mahayana texts have not received anything like the atten - tion they deserve , and it is to be hoped that Mr.
Teitaro Suzuki	PERSON	will continue his labors in this field .

		It takes the form of a series of twelve novels , to be published at monthly intervals , each of the twelve dealing with some local condition or phase of con - temporary life .

		These novels are to be the work of new or comparatively unknown writers , and as we do not understand that the entire series has yet been provided for , the announcement should serve as a stimulus to ambitious young writers all over the country .

		We learn at the very start that he is saving up his money with great care , and we at once scent a mystery some heroic resolve or secret obliga - tion .

		When we learn in the end that he has been actuated by no higher motive than ordinary parsi - mony , it is difficult to repress a feeling of disgust that any sympathy should have been wasted upon him .

		We must also say that there is a great deal too much horse talk in the book .

		Horses are inter - esting to Virginians , no doubt , but not quite to the point thus indicated .

		The story is valuable as a study of manners rather than for any analysis of character , or any development of plot , to be found within its pages .

		The second volume in this series is '' The Senti - mentalists , '' by Mr.
Arthur Stanwood	PERSON	Pier .

		We have met Mr.
Pier	PERSON	once before in a delightfully humorous sketch of the
Harvard Summer School	ORGANIZATION	and we open his new book prepared to be pleased .

		The scene is
Boston	LOCATION	, varied by excursions into
Missouri	LOCATION	, and the complications of a stock - broking promotion make it ` possible to bring two localities so diverse , both physically and morally , into the scheme of a single novel .

		The greater part of the interest is Bostonian , although by far the best chapters in the book are those which de - scribe the conflict between the opposing forces of corruption in the legislature of the
Western State	ORGANIZATION	.

		These chapters are depressing reading , but the brutal truth that they embody is of a sort only too familiar to students of our political life .

		The writer of this story is likely to be persona non grata in
Missouri	LOCATION	, and hardly less so in
Boston	LOCATION	, which he calls u the city of lowest vitality and least signifi - cance in the country . ''

		Mr.
Pier	PERSON	has not proved successful in the delineation of any of his charac - ters ; the very title of the story warns us that it is concerned rather with superficial traits than with deep-seated qualities .

		For at least the first half of the book , our constant thought was that we had rarely met with so marked a talent for dealing with the surface of character combined with so absolute an inability to penetrate into its depths .

		The later chapters forced some modification of this judgment , which must , however , stand as the essential thing to be said about the novel .

		Weak and unsatisfac - tory as he is , there is some slight vitality to the hero , but we can find little or no vitality in any other of the creatures of bis fancy .

		The most carefully studied figure of all that of the hero 's mother is a complete failure from the artistic point of view .

		She interests us exceedingly , but we never for a moment take her seriously , or find ourselves thinking of her as of a really possible human being .

		For a third time Madame ''
Sarah	PERSON	Grand '' comes to us with a novel which is essentially a study of the enfant terrible .

		Her first success was gained with the story of those '' heavenly twins '' whose pranks and audacities held the reader breathless through many hundreds of pages .

		In her second important book Beth remained interesting only as long as she remained a child ; when she grew up

		THE DIAL 269 and developed '' views , '' she became exceedingly tiresome .

		Now we have , in '' Babs the Impossible , '' another portrait of precocious childhood , and we are beginning to wish that the type presented might prove as impossible in fiction as it is in fact .

		There is , however , no denying interest of the kittenish
Babs	PERSON	, although it is an interest that palls after a time .

		Since
Babs	PERSON	remains a child to the end of the chapter , she can not be given '' views , '' like the grown-up Beth , but '' views '' there must be in any book by this strenuous champion of her wronged sex , and for the purpose of presenting them a '' new woman '' makes an unexpected and quite uncalled-for appearance near the close , and has her say with much emphasis .

		She has not the remotest connection with the story , but that does not greatly matter , for it is almost equally true of the other figures that are introduced for our diversion .

		The story is absolutely without structure , coherence , or probability ; it amuses by virtue of
Babs	PERSON	, her say - ings and escapades , and also to a certain extent by the schemes of the mountebank Jellybond , whose boniment is cleverly done , and who comes next after
Babs	PERSON	in the order of importance among the figures presented .

		Still another study of the enfant terrible is of - fered us by Miss
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	's `` The Visits of Elizabeth . ''

		Here there is much less of narrative , and correspondingly more of art , than ''
Sarah Grand	PERSON	'' has to give us .

		When we look at the frontispiece portrait of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, we can not help thinking that she will do well indeed if she can live up to its charm .

		On the whole , we should say that she does .

		She is a young English girl of sixteen or thereabouts , who has a good many relatives in both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		She makes a round of visits to these relatives , and writes home to her mother about them all .

		Her writing is absolutely naive , and therein lies the delightful quality of the book . ''

		Gyp '' in English this is what the reader says to himself when he has read two or three chapters , for
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	is very much such a girl as
Chiffon	LOCATION	, for example .

		She occasionally writes things in her innocence that have a very deep meaning , as the alert reader will soon realize , and on one occasion her audacity , or rather that of the author , is so startling that the reader holds his breath .

		The hour that this book requires may not be pro- ductive of edification , but no reader will be likely to think it misspent .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	' s new novel , comparable in volume with '' The Master , '' exhibits both the faults and the merits that were found to be characteristic of that work .

		It is perhaps somewhat less turgid and loose-jointed , but suffers even more severely from the constraint of a forced brilliancy , and a certain hardness of temper , verging upon cynicism , that puts a damper upon our sympathies when the author is most intent upon enlisting them .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	will never produce a really fine novel until he conquers the inveterate purpose of being epigram - matic upon all occasions , and learns the art of making his characters speak , at least occasionally , in the language that is used by ordinary mortals .

		This defect alone makes his figures unreal , and they are also so distorted in other respects that we can hardly be guilty of over-statement in calling them caricatures .

		This is a great pity , for there is excellent stuff in this novel , and its fundamental theme a protest against the hypocrisy of modern politics is one to interest all generous souls .

		The motives which lead our civilized nations to engage in schemes of conquest and the subjugation of un - offending peoples are dissected with merciless skill , and the cant phrases in which these schemes are de - fended are satirized with pitiless severity .

		Although the subject of the novel is English , the point of its moral is even sharper for Americans , since our newly-invented imperialism is purely wanton , where - as English imperialism is a historical inheritance which it would be difficult not to accept In spite of the faults of his work , Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	preaches a powerful sermon upon this timely topic .

		If the book just mentioned verges upon cynicism , the latest production of the writer known as
Ben	PERSON	- jamin Swift '' steps far over the verge .

		Cynicism unrelieved , and a thoroughly unsympathetic and brutal envisagement of human character , is what we find in '' Nude Souls , '' as we found these quali - ties in `` The Tormentor '' and `` The Destroyer . ''

		The fascination of morbid psychology for this writer seems to be irresistible , and his pathological studies are unrelieved by any vestige of a belief that these are not , after all , normal types of hu - manity .

		The fascination of his books is unde - niable ; they have high distinction of style , and they exhibit a masterly delineation of the characters with which the imagination of the writer chooses to consort .

		But one would suppose from reading him that this is a world in which passion always gets the better of reason , and in which the brute part of human nature remains unsubdued by all the ethical agencies of civilization .

		This were to despair of mankind indeed , and we must indignantly refuse to take so base a view of humanity .

		But we must also bear witness to the fascination pos - sessed by such a book as '' Nude Souls , '' and it needs all our resolution to escape from its baleful spell . ''

		The Conscience of Coralie , '' by Mr.
F. Frank	PERSON	- fort
Moore	PERSON	, is a novel which sins by forced clever - ness almost as notably as do the books of Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	.

		The characters , almost without exception , are made to converse in a language that bears but a remote resemblance to ordinary speech .

		The effect is supposed to be humorous , the humor being chiefly characterized by its unexpected inversions of ordinary logic .

		Otherwise , the story is highly entertaining .

		It deals with the experiences in
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	of an American heiress from
Nokomis	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		The author occasionally lets his love of burlesque get the better of his judgment , as in the scene which represents Coralie as describing '' Carpenter G. Hanker '' and other personalities of her native town , but in the main his figure of an 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, American girl is a serious study .

		She has a con - science which suggests
Massachusetts	LOCATION	rather than
Indiana	LOCATION	, and she takes
England	LOCATION	very seriously .

		After making a few startling ' discoveries , such as learning that Londoners do not habitually gaze with reverence upon Westminster Bridge because of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's sonnet that few of them , indeed , have ever heard of the sonnet she sets herself the desperate task of trying to reconcile the ideal - ism exemplified in English history and literature with the seeming indifference and even flippancy of its polite society .

		The chief instrument in her education is a socialist agitator , whose brummagem ideals she takes to be pure gold until they have been tested and exposed .

		There is also a touch of burlesque in the portrayal of this character , and we feel that the writer 's view is too prejudiced to be fair .

		But when
Coralie	PERSON	's eyes are at last opened , her judgment goes straight to the mark , and she finds that her instincts have been a safer guide than her intellect .

		In other words , she drops the socialist and marries the English gentleman whom in her heart she has loved all the time .

		Mr.
J. Storer Clouston	PERSON	's '' The Duke '' tells of the unexpected accession to rank and fortune of a young Colonial .

		He comes to
London	LOCATION	to enter into his inheritance , and society is agog to make his acquaintance .

		At this point there appears an old chum , an Irishman of the reckless and rollicking type , and the Duke impulsively decides to play a joke upon society .

		The Irishman is made to per - sonate the Duke for a month , while the latter fills the post of private secretary to his
Grace	ORGANIZATION	.

		The complications that result from this exchange of posts are set forth in a highly amusing way , and the hypocrisies of the fashionable world are satir - ized without mercy .

		When his term is up , the bogus Duke shows signs of a determination to hold on to his position which might have proved ex - tremely awkward for the secretary but the
Irish	LOCATION	- man has got himself into so bad a tangle , both socially and financially , that he sees no better way out than to `` chuck the whole thing , '' and to dis - appear from view .

		Meanwhile , the real Duke has escaped all the designs of mothers with eligible daughters , and has found a woman after his own heart before his identity has been disclosed .

King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is that this potentate has been during his prolonged youth not only Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	but also prince of good fellows .

		Whether the type of men known as '' good fellows '' are commonly of the timber out of which good kings can be made , is a question ; but Englishmen can at least congratulate themselves on the fact that their new sovereign is a tactful and kindly man who is far too sensible and temperamentally easy-going to be likely to make trouble by attempting to rule as well as reign .

		His great personal popularity is perhaps the most promising sign now discernible on the horizon of British politics ; and this valuable asset he has thus far shown no disposition to risk through a display of tendencies at which liberalism might take alarm .

		The book now before us is from the pen of ' a member of the royal household , '' and its contents are of course in the main somewhat trivial .

		The Prince 's private habits are gone into pretty minutely , and with a pious gusto on the part of the narrator that is amusing .

		Nothing that can be told is omitted , from the size of the Prince 's hat to the quality of his church in anship .

		Sartorial mat - ters are dealt with in detail , and we are informed that his Royal Highness is a good shot , a great tri - cyclist , a tireless dancer , that he has patronized the sport of pigeon-flying , and , in an inspired moment , invented a cocktail .

		Life at
Sandringham	LOCATION	and at
Marlborough House	ORGANIZATION	is pleasantly described , and chapters are devoted to the Prince 's '' set , '' his race-track exploits , his playgoing , his relations with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, with art , with letters , with Free - masonry , and what not .

		On the Prince 's reputed peccadilloes a discreet silence is maintained , as it should be .

		On the whole , one gets the impression that the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	has in general been a good deal of a trifler , and that the British nation may well be surprised if
Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		shows a disposi - tion to take himself or his position very seriously , and it is not perhaps altogether desirable that he should do so , since the British constitution does not .

		The book contains several photographic plates , and its timeliness should ensure its popularity .

		A sound and read - As is P rett y wel1 known among stu - abie history of the dents of European history , the '' Cam - French monarchy .

		bridge Historical Series '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , edited by Prof.
G. W. Prothero	PERSON	, is intended to sketch the history of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, with that of its chief colonies and conquests , from about the
end of the fifteenth century	DATE	down to the present time .

		In pursuance of this plan , about a dozen volumes have thus far been issued at varying intervals ; and when the series is completed it may well be doubted whether any equally satisfactory narrative exists within the same limits , certainly not in English .

		The large and important field covered by the history of the French monarchy has been assigned to Mr.
A. J. Grant	PERSON	, Professor of History in the
Yorkshire College	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Leeds	LOCATION	-RRB- , of
Victoria University	ORGANIZATION	.

		When we reflect that his terminal dates were
1483	DATE	and
1789	DATE	, we can only mildly wonder at his '' original inten - tion to compress the history of
France	LOCATION	between these dates within the compass of one volume that should not exceed four hundred pages . ''

		As a matter of fact the two volumes that he has given us are an admirable piece of compact philosophical narrative , marked by resolute adherence to the im -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 mediate subject and rigid refusal of even legitimate digressions .

		Professor Grant 's theme is the French Monarchy : his thesis , following in the steps of de Tocqueville and others , is '' to show that the Rev - olution did not cause so complete a breach with the past as many of the actors in it imagined , and that the
Absolute Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	, in spite of its dismal cor - ruption under Louis XV .

		and its catastrophe under Louis XVI. , rendered nevertheless great services to
France	LOCATION	, anticipating in many points the benefi - cent work of the Revolution , and in many others preparing the way for it . ''

		The old familiar ground is carefully traversed ; the authorities seem to have been thoroughly compared and digested ; and sev - eral events and personalities have been presented from a new point of view .

		For example ,
Calvin	PERSON	's character , and the importance of his doctrine as a force in the European religious struggle , are ad - mirably summed up : ' In spite of the injustice and cruelty of the Calvinistic discipline , Protestant - ism , without that discipline and all that flowed from it , would neither have won nor deserved the success that it achieved . ''

		Again , for many readers there will be an almost startling readjustment of values in accepting Professor Grant 's epigram making Charles IX .

		really one of the victims of the
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	massacre instead of its author .

		He , then , was not the worst of Catherine de ' Medici 's evil brood : that bad eminence is reserved by the author for his brother ,
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are but glimpses at a book which is both sound history and good reading .

		The work is well bound and beau - tifully printed ; to the slips noted in the errata may be added

		The beginning , of Another volume in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	modem industry Historical Series '' is Professor W. and commercf .


Cunningham	PERSON	's `` Western Civilization in its Economic Aspects -LRB- Mediaeval and Modern Times -RRB- . ''

		This is really the second volume of the work : the first , dealing with ancient times , appeared in
1898	DATE	.

		The definite object of this essay , as out - lined in the preface. , is '' to point out the remote and complicated causes in the past which have co - operated to mould industry and commerce into their present forms . ''

		In his division of the subject , Professor
Cunningham	PERSON	recognizes '' three great stages of progress , in man 's knowledge of himself , and of his place and powers in the world ; and each of these has had far-reaching effects on indus - trial and commercial life .

		Under the influence of Christian teaching , man attained to a new con - sciousness of duty ; and we can trace the workings of these ideas in the institutions of
Christendom	LOCATION	as they are most noticeably seen in the age of
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		Again , when the period of discovery came , man 's conception of the earth and of the possibili - ties it contained were suddenly enlarged , and we find the influence of this new knowledge not only in the expansion of commerce but in the national economic policies , of which
France	LOCATION	under
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		affords a typical example .

		Lastly , with the age of invention there was an increase in man 's acquaintance with physical nature , combined with special opportunities for applying that knowledge practically ; and Englishmen have taken the lead , not only as inventors but as pioneers in the work of diffusing the new industrial practices and organi - zation throughout the world .

		During each of these three periods attention has been concentrated in turn on one of the requisites of production .

		In mediaeval
Christendom	LOCATION	we find institutions for the regulation of labor ; the phase of nationalist eco - nomic policy has been chiefly concerned with the development of land ; while in recent times we see the remarkable results effected by the utilization of capital . ''

		It will be seen that this is a study of causes ; which explains , for example , the great prominence assigned to the circumstances which have made
England	LOCATION	paramount at sea , and have given to the Anglo-Saxon race its wide-reaching commercial and industrial influence ; while on the other hand the vigorous trading life of Italian cities in the Middle Ages , great and splendid as it was , is not regarded as very fruitful so far as after times were concerned .

		The whole of this second volume is even more profound and closely-wrought than the first ; and has a special interest for
Ameri	ORGANIZATION	- cans in the fact that it embodies the substance of lectures delivered by Professor
Cunningham	PERSON	at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	in
1899	DATE	, a fact which the Englishman gracefully recalls by dedicating the volume to President Eliot .

		A condte and The numerous Doo ^ 8 published of simple book late dealing with music and music onmusic .

		culture have contributed somewhat toward raising the standard of musical criticism and discussion in this country ; and the newly awakened interest in musical literature has created a demand for books especially adapted to the uses of the general reader .

		In '' Masters of Music '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , Miss
Anna Alice Chapin	PERSON	has written a series of interesting sketches of famous composers .

		While not pretending to give an estimate of his position in the world of art , the author gives a brief account of the life and work of each great artist with one exception .

		We do not find
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	in the list .

		Verdi is now to be numbered among the great ; and as a proof of the popularity of his music we have but to glance at any - season 's repertory at the Metropolitan , where his operas outnumber those of all except
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Perhaps Miss
Chapin	PERSON	feels that with
Palestrina	LOCATION	,
Scarlatti	ORGANIZATION	,
Marcello	PERSON	,
Pergolese	LOCATION	, and
Rossini	ORGANIZATION	, Italian music is sufficiently represented in her chronicle .

		The various sketches evince a thorough knowledge of the life of each artist ; anecdote has been interspersed , though not too freely , with fact ; and the list of his famous com - positions which follows after the account of each artist is most desirable for reference .

		The author has had to face the difficulty which arises from the fact that writing of any sort about music is apt to seem to the casual reader very abstruse , and the 272 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, critical portions of the volume under consideration do not appeal particularly to students of music .

		The raison d'etre of the book seems to be to supply a concise and simple work on music , with biog - raphies of the composers and a characterization of their work .

		His volume is primarily a history of choral music , and , at the same time , a critical study of composers of that department of music .

		In the preface the author states that his book is not a com - pendium for the professional , but a book for the amateur which will tell him something about the beginnings and the course of development of chorus singing ; something about the origin of choirs , their constitution , and the nature of their activity at dif - ferent periods ; something about the history of the most important choral forms , particularly the Mys - tery and the Oratorio , about their essential char - acteristics , and about the first and other notable performances of the best known of them .

		It opens with an account of the development of music among the Greeks and Hebrews , the inheritors of the Egyptian and Assyrian theories , out of which grew the tone art of the early Christian , which has re - sulted in the choral of to-day .

		Then follows a his - tory of music in the early and mediaeval church , during the period of the Christian mysteries , with a sketch of the great composer of the Passions ,
Johann Sebastian Bach	PERSON	; and a history of the Ora - torio under its famous exponent ,
George Frederick Handel	PERSON	.

		A chapter devoted to choral culture in this country reviews the conditions which led up to the organization of our singing societies , and the circumstances under which the choral institutions that were conspicuously instrumental in elevating the standard of chorus singing were established .

		The volume closes with some interesting observa - tions on the qualities necessary to the efficient chorus singer and chorus conductor , and a plea for the encouragement and promotion of choral culture in
America	LOCATION	.

		The book has an unusually accurate index .

Shailer Mathews	PERSON	's sketch of '' The French Revolu - tion '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- an unusually good manual on its topic for the general reader , or for the student who wishes to lay a sound foundation for further research .

		Nearly a third of the volume is devoted to the pre-revolutionary condition of
France	LOCATION	, for the author 's aim throughout is to explain as well as de - pict the course of events .

		Professor
Mathews	PERSON	is no votary of historical novelties , but he has neverthe - less availed himself of the work of recent special investigators wherever the new facts adduced by them point plainly to the need of a revisal of the conclusions of the older historians .

		We are espe - cially glad to note that the value of the book is not impaired by any concessions to that current spirit of paradox which courts notice through the catch - penny device of exalting bad men .

		Now that the maniacal
Marat	PERSON	, who only escapes the distinction of being the worst scoundrel in the history of dem - agogy through the extenuating fact that he was half-crazy , is credited by a historian of repute with a statesmanlike mind and a leaven of apostolic vir - tue , we may expect any day to find history rushing to the advocacy of Carrier or Fouquier-Tinville , or devoting a volume or so of perverted ingenuity to the apotheosis of
Hubert	PERSON	.

		Professor
Mathews	PERSON	's book is judicial in tone and cautious in its conclu - sions , as a manual of the kind should be .

		The publishers are to be congratulated on their selection of the author of the initial volume Miss
Hannah Lynch	PERSON	.

		Miss
Lynch	PERSON	is an Irishwoman who has been edu - cated in a French convent , and has lived in
France	LOCATION	long enough to stock her very alert and observant mind with an ample store of facts characteristic of French manners , rural and urban .

		Provincial and city life ,
Paris	LOCATION	and Parisianism , the army , educa - tion , amusements , the press , the Parisian lecture and salon , the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, the theatres , and so on , are vivaciously discussed in a series of crisp little chapters in which a turn for satire is manifest .

		Miss
Lynch	PERSON	's nationality is sometimes amusingly evident , as where she assures us that the ladies of
Dublin	LOCATION	are better dressed than those of
Paris	LOCATION	which reminds one a little of Mrs.
Major O'Dowd	PERSON	and the camelias at Ballymaloney , '' as big as tay - kettles . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 309 NOTES 309 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 310 TEN YEARS OF MUSIC .

		The tenth season of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	has just come to an end , and the occasion seems to call for a few words of comment upon the history and purpose of this remarkable enter - prise .

		When the Orchestra was organized in the
autumn of 1891	DATE	, and its support for three years was secured by a subscription guaranty of fifty thousand dollars for each year of that term , there were not many who were hopeful enough to believe that it was destined to become a permanent part of the higher life of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		So many worthy movements had come to grief in the city , so many fresh enthu - siasms had become chilled , so many commend - able enterprises had suffered untimely defeat from the caprices of fashion , that the argument from analogy seemed to indicate a like end for the newly-established Orchestra .

		When the three years of the original plan were ended , and the subscription fund had been overdrawn instead of being merely exhausted , the prospect was dark indeed , and it looked as if the work would have to be abandoned as a failure .

		But the forces which had led to its foundation proved equal to the new demands made upon them ; the public-spirited founders of the or - ganization renewed their subsidy , and the work has gone on ever since without any derogation from the fine artistic ideals that were set at its inception .

		The annual excess of expenses over receipts has fallen in the ten years from more than fifty thousand to less than
twenty thousand dollars	MONEY	, but it still remains a charge upon the group of men who have borne it from the first , and who have , moreover , borne it ungrudg - ingly , conscious that they have been supporting one of the noblest of public causes .

		It is the gift of a third of a million of dollars freely made by these men to the community during the past ten years , that has enabled
Chicago	LOCATION	to boast of the finest orchestral organization and equipment in
America	LOCATION	.

		We will not seek to praise these men as they deserve , for they would be the last to wish for such praise ; it is perhaps the chief virtue of their gift to art that they have made it for the sake of art and not for the sake of their personal reputations .

		But in spite of the manifest devotion of these men to a higher ideal than that of money - getting , there are certain elements of public opinion so dense as to be incapable of realizing that the annual balance-sheet of the orchestral organization is not the chief source of concern to its management .

		Every year , when the figures are given out , and the deficit once more stares the public in the face , a cry goes up from the newspapers to the effect that the loss might easily have been avoided by bringing the pro- grammes presented down a little nearer to the 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, level of popular taste .

		Give us more '' request programmes , '' it is said , put in a few waltzes and medleys of operatic airs , and the public will crowd the concert hall .

		This is true , no doubt , but it is jiot the wish of the manage - ment to secure large audiences at such a cost .

		The Orchestra is first and foremost an educa - tional enterprise , and the requirements of art are held paramount by Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	and his supporters alike .

		Those who can not under - stand how practical men may be actuated by such a motive should fall on their knees and pray for enlightenment , instead of assuming the injured air of persons whose good advice is ungratefully rejected .

		Yet the advice is proffered year after year by the same perse - vering critics , and it seems quite impossible to convince them that it is not wanted , or that the men who are responsible for the work > of the
Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	know quite as well as their critics that the concerts could be made to pay if it were thought desirable .

		How well they have paid in a better than the commercial sense is apparent to every ob - server of musical conditions in
Chicago	LOCATION	during the past ten or twenty years .

		By dint of per - sistent hammering at the public , of giving the public what was good for it instead of what it wanted , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has transformed the great modern composers , one by one , from esoteric mysteries into sources of vital enjoyment .

		To begin with , he forced
Wagner	PERSON	upon an unwil - ling public until those who had come to scoff remained to pray , and a
Wagner	PERSON	programme had come to be the surest means of filling the house from pit to topmost gallery .

		Then he dealt with
Brahms	PERSON	, and Tschaikowsky , and
Dvorak	PERSON	in similar fashion , and made them almost equally popular .

		Yet while pursuing this course , he did not permit the public to neglect the great composers who were in less need of such championship , and the works of
Bach	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	and
Beethoven	PERSON	were produced with generous frequency .

		Certain it is that the programmes which now attract the largest audiences are of the sort that would have been most certainly doomed to failure in the early years of the missionary and educational work done for
Chicago	LOCATION	by the devotion of this un - bending idealist .

		The largest audience that ever assembled for a concert in the
Chicago Auditorium	ORGANIZATION	an audience that filled all the seats and packed the foyer behind the seats with the dense rows of the standing was the one that gathered there a few weeks ago to hear a programme consisting of two sym - phonies and a concerto for piano and orchestra .

		As recently as ten years ago this achievement could not possibly have been realized .

		During the ten years that the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	has exercised its beneficent ministry , over two hundred programmes have been pre - pared , and each of them twice performed , once in the afternoon and once in the evening .

		The list of the works produced at these concerts comprises practically the whole repertoire , of the modern orchestra , and makes a most im - posing showing as printed in the last concert - book of the season just ended .

		It includes , for example , sixty symphonies , by nearly half that number of composers .

		Of these symphonies one hundred and seventy double performances have been given , the C minor of Beethoven heading the list with twenty afternoon and evening presentations .

		The forms of the con - certo , the concert overture , the suite , the rhapsody , and the symphonic poem are repre - sented in equally rich variety , and nearly all the great works for solo performance likewise appear in the list .

		Taking the name of Beet - hoven alone , we find , besides fifty double per - formances of the nine symphonies , more than fifty double performances of other numbers .

		Wagner is represented by almost everything that can possibly be used for concert purposes , over sixty distinct numbers being included in the programmes , with nearly three hundred double performances .

		The above facts and figures will give some faint idea of the musical feast set before the
Chicago	LOCATION	public during the past ten years by Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	and his musi - cians .

		It has provided nothing less than a liberal education in music for many thousands of people , and the community as a whole with a spiritual uplift that no psychological calculus has the power to estimate .

		For this best of gifts we wish to express our appreciation and to record our heartfelt gratitude to the men at whose hands it has been received .

		ALEXANDER
CALDWELL McCLURG	ORGANIZATION	.

		The death of
Alexander Caldwell McClurg	PERSON	, on the
15th of April	DATE	, deprived the business and in - tellectual life of
Chicago	LOCATION	of one of its most con - spicuous figures .

		General McClurg was born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1834	DATE	, and was educated at
Miami University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He enlisted as a private in the Civil War , and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General .

		His military record was one of distinction ; he took part in the battles of
Stone River	LOCATION	,
Chickamauga	LOCATION	,
Missionary Ridge	ORGANIZATION	,
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 and
Atlanta	LOCATION	, besides accompanying
Sherman	PERSON	on his famous march to the sea .

		After the war he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	and engaged in the hook business , at first with
S. C. Griggs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, then with
Jansen	PERSON	,
McClarg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and finally became head of the firm of
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which was reorgan - ized as a stock company about two years ago , with
General McClurg	ORGANIZATION	at its head .

		The bookselling business of this house grew to great dimensions , and the publishing department , although less im - portant , attained a highly respectable development under the personal direction of the head of the house .

		General
McClurg	PERSON	was actively interested in many of the organizations of the intellectual forces of the city , particularly in the
Chicago	LOCATION	His - torical Society and the
Chicago Literary Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		He also did much valuable work in behalf of the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The events of recent years ranged him stanchly on the side of the traditional political ideals of his country , and the cause of anti-imperialism found in him an energetic and outspoken ally .

		THE DIAL owes a special tribute to his memory , both because of his frequent contri - butions to its pages , and because the firm of which he was a member was part owner of the journal , as well as its publisher , during its first twelve years .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		CONCERNING TRAGEDY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Inasmuch as play-goers have been seeing tragedies ever since the time of JEschylus , and probably long be - fore , it would seem an easy thing to say what tragedy is .

		Yet it has proved to be not an easy thing at all .

		Aristotle apparently settled it for his own time , but his ears must have burned during the last three centuries , and still nothing is decided .

		The latest word comes from Prof.
E. E. Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, who in a recent number of THE DIAL takes issue with Mr.
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	* for presenting the leading idea of tragedy as a conflict , and himself maintains that its essential element is really '' the strange and unexplain - able courses of life . ''

		The first theory is certainly incomplete .

		It would follow from it that all plays are tragedies , since no real plot can be constructed that is not based on conflict of some sort .

		Obviously , we must also consider the nature of the conflict , the manner of its course and termina - tion , and the character of the participants .

		Briefly stated , it seems to me that the conflict must involve great suffering , otherwise it is simply heroic -LRB- instance the
Heracles	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , or comic -LRB- instance Falstaff -RRB- ; that it must end in failure , and that this failure we must , as we look back , feel to be inevitable , that is , in accord - ance with law , and not the result of arbitrary fiat or of accident ; finally , the fighter himself must be a great nature , since otherwise he can neither greatly suffer nor '' The Idea of Tragedy in Ancient and
Modern Drama	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three Lectures delivered at the Royal Institution by
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	. ''

		I have as yet been nnable to see the book , so know it only through Mr.
Bale	PERSON	's criticism .

		greatly contend , and our interest in him can not be last - ing .

		Ibsen 's '' An Enemy of the People '' is not a tragedy , because its hero ,
Stockmann	ORGANIZATION	, does not fail ; he wins , and at the end of the play he is more fit than at the beginning .

		The same is true of `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' :
Nora	PERSON	has struggled somewhat as one does in a dream , but by the .

		end of the play she has waked , and is ready to make a real fight of it , with a life-time ahead in which to do battle , and not for herself alone .


Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's Haunele , on the other hand , is not a tragic but apathetic figure : she suffers but does not fight ; she is a helpless child done to death by a brutal fate , but comforted at last by her radiant death - visions . ''

		The Second Mrs. Tanqueray '' shows conflict , and inevitable failure , and suffering , but fails of greatness because its characters , eccentric or clever or charming or whatever else , are fundamentally mediocre ; whereas ''
Magda	PERSON	'' -LRB- `` Die Heimath '' -RRB- , though less clever , is greater , by reason of its heroine and her superb vitality .

		But while the conflict-theory fails through incom - pleteness , the mystery-theory , as we may call Professor Bale 's , fails rather through a confused use of terms , and this in a number of ways . ''

		Hamlet , '' we are told , is tragic because we do not understand it . ''

		As soon as we understand it , it ceases to be tragedy . ''

		And the tragedy lies , it appears , in the fact that , though endowed with such gifts as ought to bring success of the best kind , he yet does not suc - ceed , and we can not see why .

		Yet it is admitted that we do see how , for '' when the conditions are once given , we do not deny a single step . ''

		What , then , is seeing why , if it is not just this seeing how things happen , this following their course step by step from beginning to end ?

		Do we , or can we , in any other sense see why anything happens , from the processes of digestion to those of the poet 's fancy ?

		Unless , indeed , we expect to fathom what we , by misleading anthropomorphism , call the '' motives , '' of what we , again by misleading anthro - pomorphism , call '' the Creator . ''

		And inasmuch as the same mystery lies over all things , we can not regard it as the special ear-mark of a particular class .

		Again , '' The Second Mrs. Tanqueray '' is deemed tragic because `` although we know that she could not have turned over a new leaf -LRB- gluing the old ones down -RRB- , we are not at all clear as to why she could not .

		It seems as if she should have had a chance . ''

		On the contrary , Mrs.
Tanqneray	PERSON	's case appears to me a par - ticularly clear one , both in its nature and in virtue of its presentation ; nothing could be easier to understand , in the only way in which we can ever understand any - thing .

		The tragic element in '' L'Aiglon '' is accounted for as in ' Hamlet . ''

		Professor
Hale	PERSON	thinks the Duke , '' on the whole , an attractive man with a good head and heart and great ambitions .

		People love him ; he ought to do well .

		Now he does not do well at all . ''

		But here again there seems to me nothing mysterious .

		I should , indeed , prefer to describe the Duke as an attractive boy with a poor head , diseased sensibilities , and spec - tacular dreams , but Professor
Hale	PERSON	himself admits his '' besetting triviality , '' and in fact explains satisfactorily just why the Duke could not possibly '' do well . ''

		There is in it no `` strange unexplainableness , '' except , as sug - gested above , of the sort that all things possess .

		We may , if we like , make a mystery of the fact that anaemic though attractive boys do not succeed , and that great fathers sometimes have unsuccessful sons , but there is not much to gain by it .

		According to my way 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, of thinking , '' L'Aiglon '' is not a tragedy at all , but a pathetic spectacle , like '' Hannele '' done on a gorgeous scale , wherein , by means of a series of rather loosely connected scenes , we see the spirit of a lovable child bruised and crushed by the relentless forces of life .

		There is nothing worth calling a struggle ; he does not , as the slang phrase goes , '' put up any fight at all . ''

		It seems , then , as though the mystery-theory involved us in confusion as to what '' seeing why '' really means .

		But perhaps the trouble is caused by a failure to dis - tinguish between the argument of a play and the play itself .

		Professor
Hale	PERSON	has two minds about '' Hamlet , '' one when he thinks of the story , another when he thinks of the play : when thinking of the first he '' can not see why it should have happened at all , '' when thinking of the second he '' does not deny a single step . ''

		Note that it is the second mood which is induced by the play itself , the mood , not of querulous mystification but of compelled understanding , which accompanies our sense of the tragic .

		It is not while we follow the play that we '' do not see why , '' it is only when we repeat , in barren and meaningless formula , the story of the play .

		This argument rather makes against its own cause , in - dicating that our feeling of the tragic and our under - standing of its inevitable processes are at least con - comitants .

		In discussing '' A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' Professor
Hale	PERSON	again mistakes the material of the tragedy for the tragedy itself .

		It can not , he argues , be the conflict between husband and wife that makes it tragic , because '' a brawling house is not tragic . ''

		Not when thus form - ulated , certainly , but it has been made the basis of more great tragedies than any other one subject .

		He adds that this particular brawl '' was an extraordinary case , or perhaps it only seemed so because of the skill in putting the case . ''

		Exactly .

		In other words , it was the writer 's skill which made it to some extent into a tragedy .

		Curiously enough , all great tragedians have this skill :
Lear	PERSON	's was a brawling house , too ; so was Agamemnon 's , and Antigone 's , and
Beatrice Cenci	PERSON	's .

		In Professor
Hale	PERSON	's discussion of '' Hamlet '' there is a further confusion of terms : '' Granted that
Hamlet	PERSON	was too weak of will , how did he get so ?

		By too much thinking ?

		Is not thinking the great faculty of man , the thing that raises him above the beasts ?

		Why should too much thought put the thinker in the power of the circumstances around him ?

		We do not understand these things . ''

		But the difficulty here is that Professor
Hale	PERSON	is using the word '' thinking '' in two senses , as a general term for human reason , of which we can not have too much , and as a special name for a special kind of activity which we all know does , speaking pop - ularly , interfere with effective action .

		And we all know , too , in a general way , the reasons why it does thus interfere .

		Take a real instance : An old professor was sitting in a street car with his legs crossed , reading , when he suddenly realized that he had passed his cor - ner .

		He arose hastily and tried to leave the car , but having neglected to uncross his legs he found it diffi - cult , almost impossible .

		What was his trouble ?

		Too much thinking ; which thus actually had `` put him in the power of the circumstances around him . ''

		Thinking may do this at any time , and no mystery about it ; it all depends on the circumstances , and on how and what one thinks .

		In this case the lowest of the '' beasts , '' even a hen , would have done better than the professor .

		The mystery-theory , then , does not appear to me as a satisfactory solution of the problem .

		I rather believe that the reverse of it is the truer , and that it is in so far as we do , in the only way possible , understand the course of evil , so that it becomes a part of the great world-order to which we belong , that it appeals to our tragic sense .

		So long as it appears unaccountable , arbitrary , so long shall we feel impatience and rebellion , so long shall we be withheld from experiencing with regard to it the '' pity and fear '' which , whatever is meant by them , are admitted to be the essentials of the tragic attitude .

		Caliban 's notion of Setebos `` just choosing so '' admits of suffering and of conflict , but not of tragedy , and the arbitrary postulate , as it seems to us moderns , in the '' CEdipus , '' is its weakness , not its strength .

		It is this understanding of evil , this seeing through it , seeing how , which it is preeminently the tragedian 's business to endow us with ; if he fails of this , he has not written a tragedy , but a melodrama , or something else .

		Thus , Professor
Hale	PERSON	holds that while '' Hamlet '' is a tragedy , the death of a young man in battle is not .

		Granted , but why ?

		Not because we understand the evil involved ; I do not think we do , the
Providence	LOCATION	that governs battlefields seems quite as inscrutable as the
Providence	LOCATION	that governs royal murders ; but be - cause such a death , glorious or pathetic according to one 's point of view , is what we call accidental : the bullet happened to come his way .

		An artist may arise who will take such a story and make it seem to us in - evitable , but no one has yet done so .

		Perhaps the nearest approach to it is in ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' where the catastrophe is the outcome of a series of unfortunate accidents , any one of which might have turned out dif - ferently and saved the game .

		But I think the play only helps to prove the point , for it has never seemed to me a great tragedy , when compared with the great - est ; it seems a sweet and pathetic love-story , like that of ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' and I have never been able to see anything very shocking in the German acting ver - sion which arrested the poison and the dagger , and allowed the lovers to live happily ever after .

		Moreover , it is significant that a class of college girls , when I re - ferred to the play casually as a tragedy , almost unani - mously protested .

		Everything , they argued , was going well , the plan of escape , though a stupidly complicated one , might easily have succeeded , and they refused to consider a play tragic which held within itself even up to the last moment the possibility of a happy solution .

		When asked about ''
Lear	PERSON	, '' and the happy solution which used occasionally to be substituted at its close by our German -LRB- and , alas !

		English too -RRB- play-managers , they held that the case was different ; that here the tragedy lay not in the death of
Lear	PERSON	but in his life , and that even if he had ended his days in comfortable senility , tended by
Cordelia	PERSON	, his life would have been none the less a tragic failure , and inevitably a failure .

		It is , then , not '' strange unexplainableness '' that makes tragedy , nor is it conflict alone .

		Tragedy gives us something different from the one and something more than the other .

		It shows us great suffering , mortal conflict , great natures , and as it shows us these it makes us feel that they , and we , are in the grasp of eternal , unalterable law .

		The suffering and the struggle , when apparently outside the dominion of law , arouse in us only extreme rebellion or sullen non-resistance ; when manifestly within its realm , they stir in us those feel - ings of '' pity and fear '' which are our response to what we call great tragedy .

		* '' What fun ! ''

		cheerily ejaculates Mr. Au - gustus
Hare	PERSON	, of guide-book fame , in a letter to a friend , after telling how the Reviews had been abusing him for what they thought the twaddle , conceit , toadyism , inordinate length , and so forth , of the first instalment -LRB- in two volumes -RRB- of his autobiography .

		Even the staid '' Athenaeum '' for once lost its temper , and called Mr.
Hare	PERSON	a '' literary valet , '' the '' British Review '' went so far as to think him * ' an absolute beast , '' a critic out in
India	LOCATION	voted him and his '' chatter '' a '' prodigious nuis - ance , '' an American paper politely hinted that so erratic a
Hare	PERSON	must surely be one of the
March	DATE	variety , and , in fine , Mr.
Hare	PERSON	must have felt as if the good old days of
Jeffrey	PERSON	and
Lockhart	PERSON	were come again for his express en - tertainment .

		Bent on having more '' fun '' of this unusual sort , Mr.
Hare	PERSON	now puts forth a second brace of much thicker volumes on the same seductive theme , and gleefully awaits the result .

		We are sorry to disappoint him of our small con - tribution to the treat he has promised himself , but we must in candor say that his book , though long and of no great substance , strikes us nevertheless as a really entertaining one in its way , and even as an almost ideal book to pick about in and dawdle over in the dozy
Summer days	DATE	, when one is content to keep cool and drift along idly on the stream of almost any - body 's talk .

		It is , furthermore , to our notion , a book that reflects , not '' an absolute beast '' -LRB- how the '' British Review '' could speak or think thus of the winsome and accomplished Augustus passes our comprehension -RRB- , but an amiable , talkative gentleman , who , if he some - what too manifestly has a high opinion of him - self , has at all events come by it honestly .

		For Mr.
Hare	PERSON	has long been a very popular writer with that large class of occasional readers who , when they like a man 's books , like them with - out stint or qualification , and are eager to tell him so , rapturously , when they meet him in the flesh .

		memorials , and how much , how very much , the name of
Augustus Hare	PERSON	meant to them .

		Few men 's natural modesty , however great , could have withstood that sort of thing very long ; and it is no wonder if Mr.
Hare	PERSON	, living thus daily within earshot of his own praises and basking in the sun of his great social popu - larity , has come at last to '' take himself pretty seriously , '' and even to feel it incumbent on him to climb to the general view on a pedestal of autobiography four volumes high .

		We deplore as much as anybody what Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	calls the `` big-biography habit , '' and we think that a writer who has contracted it ought to be suppressed and kept out of print until time and abstention have effected a radical cure .

		The practice of exhibiting one-volume men in two-volume and even three-volume books has increased , is increasing , and ought to be diminished , even if an example has to be made of a contumacious biographer or two .

		But in Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's seemingly aggravated case of making much ado about comparatively noth - ing , it ought in fairness to be observed that what he calls the story of his life is in point of fact so largely made up of stories about and by others , and of impersonal descriptions of places he has visited in his capacity of quasi - professional tourist and guide-book maker , that it may be read with interest even by those who care least about Mr.
Hare	PERSON	himself .

		Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's habit of Boswellizing even his chance and un - important acquaintances , of jotting down their talk and especially their stories , is largely re - sponsible for the length of his book .

		Telling in his journal , for instance , how he breakfasted with a Mr.
Richmond	PERSON	he relates how his host '' Talked of
Carlyle	PERSON	of how his peculiarities began in affectation , but that now he was simply lost in the mazes of his own vocabulary .

		One night , he said , he met a man at
Albert Gate	PERSON	at 12 p. M. , who asked for a light for his cigar .

		He did not see who it was till , as he was turning away , he recognized
Carlyle	PERSON	, who gave a laugh which could be heard all down Piccadilly as he exclaimed , ' I thought it was just any son of
Adam	PERSON	, and I find a friend . ' ''

		Carlyle was tormented by street noises .

		He said to Mr.
Hare	PERSON	: `` That which the warld torments me in most is the awful confusion of noise .

		It is the devil 's own infernal din all the blessed day long , confounding God 's warks and His creatures a truly hell-like combination , and the warst of it a ' is a railway whistle , like the screech of ten thousand cats and ivery cat of them as big as a cathedral . ''

		In his diary Mr.
Hare	PERSON	tells amusingly of a dinner at the Grotes ' . ''

		After dinner , she -LRB- Mrs.
Grote	PERSON	-RRB- would leave ' the historian , ' as she called him , in his study , and come up to the drawing-room , where she would talk to her 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, guests and be most entertaining .

		At nine o'clock , tea would be brought up such a tea as one never sees now , with tablecloth , muffins , cakes , etc. .

		Then she would say to the servant , ' Bring up the historian ' and the historian was ' brought up . '

		He was vastly civil , of the old school , and wore a great deal of frill .

		He would take his place opposite the table , and im - mediately taking a large clean pocket-handkerchief from his pocket , spread it very deliberately over his knees , after which a dog jumped up and sat on it .

		Then he would say , as to a perfect stranger , ' And now , Mrs.
Grote	PERSON	, will you kindly favor us with a sonata ? '

		and Mrs.
Grote	PERSON	, who was an admirable musician , would play a very long sonata indeed ; after which he would say , ' Thank you , Mrs.
Grote	PERSON	.

		I am sure Lady Lyvedon joins with me in being very much obliged to you for your beautiful sonata . ' ''

		Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's impressions of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, as re - corded in his diary , will not please the poet 's admirers who would have no spots on their sun . ''

		... This afternoon I have been with Mrs.
Gre	PERSON	- ville to Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	at Haselmere ... Tennyson is older looking than I expected , so that his unkempt ap - pearance signifies less .

		He has an abrupt , bearish manner , and seems thoroughly hard and wnpoetical : one would think of him as a man in whom the direst prose of life was absolutely ingrained .

		Mrs.
Greville	PERSON	kissed his hand as he came in , which he received with - out any protest .

		He asked if I would like to go out , and we walked round the gardens .

		By way of break - ing the silence I said , ` How fine your arbutus is . '

		Well , I would say arbutus , ' he answered , < otherwise you are as bad as the gardeners , who say Clematis ' ... For the poet 's bearish manners the
Tennyson	PERSON	family are to blame , in making him think himself a demigod .

		One day , on arriving at Mrs.
Greville	PERSON	's , he said at once , ' Give me a pipe , I want to smoke . '

		She at once went off by herself down the village to the shop , and return - ing with two pipes , offered them to him with all be - coming subservience .

		He never looked at her or thanked her , but , as he took them , growled out , '' Where are the matches ?

		I suppose now you 've forgotten the matches ! '

		... Dined at
Lady Lyvedon 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sat by Lady S. , who was very pleasant .

		She talked of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, who had been to stay with her .

		He desired his sons to let her know that he should like to be asked to read some of his poems in the
evening	TIME	.

		Nevertheless , when she asked him , he made a piece of work about it , and said to the other guests , ' I do it , but I only do it be - cause Lady S. absolutely insists upon it . '

		He read badly and with too much emotion : over `
Maud	PERSON	' he sobbed passionately . ''

		Glad , no doubt , to have escaped the spec - tacle of a man '' sobbing passionately '' in public over his own poems , Mr.
Hare	PERSON	was nevertheless compelled to hear
Browning	PERSON	read at Lady
Airlie 's	ORGANIZATION	, and it was a sore trial to him . ''

		I never heard any one , even a child of ten , read so atrociously .

		It was two of his own pieces ' Good news to
Ghent	ORGANIZATION	' and
Ivan Ivanowitch	PERSON	, ' the latter always most horrible and unsuitable for reading aloud , but in this case rendered utterly unintelligible by the melodramatic vocal contortions of the reader . ''

		The following passage from Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's journal seems in general fairly characteristic , and may serve to indicate a certain quality in his writing which is the one , we fancy , largely responsible for the irritation of his critics .

		`` I was afterwards at a breakfast at
Lord Bute	ORGANIZATION	's .

		There were few people I knew there , and the grass was very wet , so I sat under the verandah with the Egertons .

		Presently an old lady was led out there , very old , and evidently unable to walk , but with a dear beautiful face , dressed in widow 's weeds .

		She seemed to know no one , so gradually I do not know how it came about I gave her a rose , and sat down at her feet on the mat , and she talked of many beautiful things .

		She was evidently sitting in the most peaceful waiting upon the very threshold of the heavenly king - dom .

		When I was going away she said , ' I should like to know whom I have been talking to . '

		I said , ' My name is
Augustus Hare	PERSON	. '

		She said , ' I divined that when you gave me the flower . '

		I have not a notion who she was . '

		THE SCIENCE OF MEANING .

		* Etymology is a science , said
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, in which vowels count for nothing and consonants for mighty little .

		Since then there has arisen a science of language at whose bar every slight - est dialectical variation and shadow of a breath - ing is required to justify its existence , and the old gibe has lost its force .

		But the etymology of which
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	spoke was essentially the etymology of the ancients .

		It was a more or less ingenious and plausible playing of the fancy about the transitions of meaning by which one word arises out of another .

		At its worst , it was a refined form of punning .

		At its best , it was a convenient vehicle for the con - veyance of ethical and assthetical symbolism , as it appears in the etymologizing of Plato and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, or in
Ruskin	LOCATION	's interpretations of the proper names in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		Plato derived hemera , day , from himeros , desire , because primitive man , reversing
Shelley	PERSON	's practice , passed the night in terror-stricken longing for the dawn .

		Aristotle deduced dikaios , just , from dicha , in twain , because justice is a fair division .

		THE DIAL 299 much better .

		The great Scaliger himself de - rived persona from peri soma , around the body .

		But there is some naivete in the modern scholar 's triumph over the ignorance of his predecessors .

		Superior minds , such as Plato and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, were well aware that etymolo - gizing , like the allegorical interpretation of mythology and poetry , was merely a literary device .

		They did not take their fancies so seriously as we are apt to assume .

		But in the absence of verified scientific law , it was impos - sible for even the greatest thinkers to acquire the modern educated man 's instinctive sense of the possible and impossible in this field or in the world of physical phenomena .

		But truth is stranger than fiction and quite as interesting .

		The miracles of fairy land are eclipsed by the realities of modern science , and etymologies on which philology has set its austere seal present as good material for the kaleidoscopic play of fantastic associations , as the uncontrolled fancies of pre-scientific literary ingenuity .

		Why resort to romance to derive Alfana from equus if science permits us to dis - til glamour from grammar , kneads dough into fiction , demonstrates the identity of wig and
Mount Pilate	ORGANIZATION	, extracts eel and quinsy from the same root , and equates tear and larme , while warning us that there is nothing in com - mon between boucher and boucfte , kaleo and call , holos and whole , auge light and Auge eye ?

		And wherein is the notorious antiphrasis lucus a non lucendo funnier than the admitted deri - vation of paraffin from parum affinis , too little akin ?

		Until recently , however , this fascinating field has been abandoned to the popular essay - ist , or invaded by the philologer only for the purpose of culling a casual flower or two to commend his severer wares .

		But of late there has been a demand that this domain too be annexed by science , and brought under the reign of strict philological law .

		Monographs have been written on the development of mean - ings in particular classes of words , as numbers , verb-forms , words of color , or the names of the operations of the mind .

		And here and there a scholar emulous of
Holmes	PERSON	's coleopterist , and adopting a term introduced by the gram - marian
Reisig	PERSON	about the year
1830	DATE	, has de - nominated himself a semasiologist , or student of the science of meanings .

		The most enthu - siastic advocate of the new study is Professor
Michel Breal	PERSON	, best known to scholars for his edition of the Eugubine Tables and his etymo - logical Latin Lexicon .

		After many years ' de - lay , and the anticipatory publication of various popular papers on the theme , he about two years ago put forth a volume to which , with a slight modification of the current term , he gave the name '' Semantiqye . ''

		And this , translated under the title '' Semantics '' by Mrs.
Henry Gust	PERSON	, and introduced in an interesting and suggestive though somewhat rambling essay by Professor Postgate , now lies before us .

		Professor
Breal	PERSON	has written a charming book .

		Has he constituted a new science ?

		Apart from a few modifications of terminology , has he anything to offer that is new I will not say to the student of recent German seniasio - logical work , but even to the reader of
Max Miiller	PERSON	, Trench '' On the Study of Words , '' or the ingenious author of '' Stories from the
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary '' ?

		I think not .

		Of the three divisions of Professor
Breal	PERSON	's work , only the second part , '' How the Mean - ing of Words is Determined , '' belongs to his subject taken in the stricter sense .

		The first part , though entitled '' The Intellectual Laws of Language , '' is mainly concerned with forms and inflections , and together with the third part , '' How Syntax is Formed , '' falls under semantics only if we make the word cover everything in the science of language not in - cluded in sound change .

		Now the phenomena of semantics in the larger as in the narrower sense are primarily special manifestations of the association of ideas , and can with a little ingenuity be grouped under a few broad rubrics , such as association by similarity or antithesis , or contiguity in time or place , or causal se - quence , expansion and restriction of meaning , specialization , generalization , concretion , ab - straction , metaphor , analogy , confusion , con - tamination , survival , and the like .

		The number of such categories actually employed in any given treatise , and the precision and subtlety with which they are discriminated , depend more on the logical idiosyncrasy of the author than on any inherent and constraining order in the phenomena .

		Mr.
Breal	PERSON	's tripartite division , while conducive to clearness in some respects , is unfavorable to his design of eliciting a few simple laws .

		It leads to over-subtlety of classi - fication and the multiplication of terminology , a malady of science quite as serious as the abuse of abstract and metaphorical language which he so sensibly deprecates .

		Thus what he calls the law of specialization is illustrated in Part One by the tendency of words of originally substantive import to be - come specialized as mere signs of grammatical relations .

		It is in this way that the transition 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, from synthetic to analytic languages is ex - plained .

		It is a misleading metaphor , Mr.
Breal	PERSON	thinks , to say that the case endings de - cay and are replaced by prepositions and a fixed syntactic order .

		What really happened was that the Latins , seeking precision , fell into the habit of saying dare ad aliquem instead of dare alicui , and then the terminations no longer needed were discarded .

		These considerations are interesting , but the term specialization could be and has been applied within the field of Semantics proper to the facts which Mr.
Breal	PERSON	relegates to another book and chapter under the heading '' Restriction of Meaning '' the narrowing , that is , of extension and deepening of intension by which , e. g. , tectum becomes the special covering toit .

		So with '' differentiation , '' Mr.
Breal	PERSON	's second law .

		As applied to vocabulary it is virtually equivalent to the '' desynonymization '' of Trench .

		The classical illustration of this process is found in `` Ivanhoe , '' in
Wamba	LOCATION	's reflections on sheep and mutton , oxen and beef , and it is manifested when advancing thought sharply discriminates for its convenience terms like genus and species , brigade , regiment , battalion , esteem , respect , venerate , whose etymology supplies no necessary basis for such distinction .

		But the term also includes the process by which the infi - nite wealth of Greek and Sanscrit verb-forms are appropriated to separate functions , and for this reason Mr.
Breal	PERSON	treats of it in Part One .

		The phenomena which many scholars lump under analogy Mr.
Breal	PERSON	distributes into sev - eral groups .

		He coins , e , g. , the term '' irradia - tion '' to denote the process by which a depre - ciatory subaudition attaching to a few words of the originally innocent termination aster spreads and irradiates into all words of like ending giving MS poetaster and maratre .

		Under analogy proper he discusses rather the psycho - logical motives of the resort to analogy .

		And from the fact that there always is such a motive he concludes somewhat sophistically that we have no right to speak of false analogies as if they were mere blunders .

		We can un - doubtedly detect a method in the madness of children who say '' I goed , '' or in the late Latin speakers who coined prostrare from prostravi , and developed etude from a supposed feminine studia .

		But common sense will con - tinue to speak of blunders and false analogies in spite of Mr.
Breal	PERSON	's ingenious plea that such imperfect speakers are actuated by the highest impulse the search for regularity and law !

		The second part , u How the Meaning of Words is Determined , '' treats of such topics as the restriction and expansion of meaning , metaphor , polysemia , etc. , and , in final sum - mary , '' How Names are Given to Things . ''

		These chapters with their wealth of apt illus - tration are very readable .

		But we can not admit that they constitute even the beginning of a new science .

		That things are often named from one of their qualities taken as represen - tative of the rest , as when a horse was for the Aryans the swift thing par excellence , and for the modern Greek the irrational thing ; that meanings may be strangely narrowed , as when species becomes spices and ninth mood is lim - ited to courage ; or widened , as when pecunia becomes the symbol of wealth generally ; that metaphor is one of the chief ways in which the imagination creates new meanings , as when the first threads of the warp came to stand for all primordia and exordia ; that experts in every matter use abbreviated expressions the meaning of which is determined by the context , or by what the logicians call the '' universe of dis - course , '' as when novellce means new vines to a farmer , and to a jurist laws added to the code of Justinian these and similar propo - sitions were not first enunciated or illustrated by the science of Semantics .

		It is an inter - esting fact -LRB- if true -RRB- that tempus originally meant temperature .

		But when Mr.
Breal	PERSON	adds that then in French weather was thus desig - nated , and finally , the abstract idea of dura - tion , was reached , he will mislead readers who do not recall that Aristotle discussed the meta - physics of '' time '' with the word chronos -LRB- the including ? -RRB-

		which in modern Greek has sunk to '' year , '' while the kairos , or opportune moment , of Greek ethics and poetry now means weather .

		Such curiosities give us no law or principle ; they merely tell us that any incident or aspect of the passage of the hours or seasons may by historical accident become the sign of the abstract idea of time , and again be degraded to a trivial concrete meaning .

		The writer of a popular book on language naturally groups and arranges his examples , as a psychologist classifies his anecdotal illustrations of the as - sociation of ideas , or a rhetorician invents an elaborate nomenclature for different kinds of metaphors .

		But after the enunciation of a few general principles or pathways of associa - tion , there is no scientific law in either case to determine the number of the headings and subdivisions .

		They may as well be thirty as ten .

		It is purely a question of literary skill and convenience of presentation of the ma -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 terial .

		But the classifying and name-giving instinct is ineradicable , and its excesses are a perpetual source of illusion here , and in the neighboring fields of grammar and literary criticism .

		And so while agreeing with Mr.
Breal	PERSON	that Semantics is a much more interest - ing and , in its unsystematic way , more in - structive subject than the study of vowels and consonants , we can not admit that it is or can be a science even in the limited sense in which the term is applicable to what has hitherto been known as comparative philology .

		Nor has our opinion been altered by the perusal of Professor
Wundt	PERSON	's recently published ``
Volk	PERSON	- erpsychologie . ''

		He demonstrates with super - fluity of logic that every change of meaning has a cause .

		But so has every action of man .

		We do not therefore regard political history as a science .

		There is doubtless a reason why the French word for liver -LRB- foie -RRB- is derived fromjicatum -LRB- fig-fed -RRB- and not from jecur ; or why pig -LRB- e -RRB- in Danish means what the French call a '' young person , '' and not the less poet - ical young thing to which it is limited in our own tongue .

		But the reason in each instance is historical and -LRB- for purposes of human sci - ence -RRB- accidental .

		Such facts can not be con - verted into a science by the application to illustrations taken from Trench and
Breal of Wundt	ORGANIZATION	's own ponderous subdivision of what the rest of us call associations into assimilations , complications , and apperceptions .

		We are none the wiser for being told that the familiar metaphor from sight to sound in the phrase '' a clear voice '' -LRB- clarus -RRB- is a case of '' primary complicative Bedeutungswandel '' falling under the formula ndA -LRB- E B -RRB- ndE -LRB- AB -RRB- -

		Religious interests appeal to him strongly .

		He mentions the revivals , the '' stir of religion in college , '' as he expresses it , to which Dr.

College of New Jersey	ORGANIZATION	, has made more extended reference .

		The formerly abandoned
Glover	PERSON	'' is spoken of as 302 THE DIAL -LSB-

Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, as he was expelled from the college the following winter for steal - ing turkeys . ''

		The fashion in college pranks has certainly changed since
Fithian	PERSON	's day .

		The greater part of the volume is devoted to the
Virginia	LOCATION	diary and letters .

		Like
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	twenty-five years later ,
Philip Fithian	PERSON	went from college to a tutorship in a
Virginia	LOCATION	gentleman 's family ; like him he was meanwhile fitting for the ministry ; like him he was sometimes homesick ; and like him he was debarred for pecuniary reasons from much of the gay life of the Old Dominion .

		He , no less than Ghanning , noted the differ - ences , social , moral , and temperamental , be - tween the Southerners and the Northerners . ''

		The people are extremely hospitable , '' he writes , '' and very polite , both of which are most certainly universal Characteristics of the Gentlemen in
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		He adds , however , that '' some swear bitterly , but the practice seems to be generally disapproved . ''

		In de - scribing '' Miss Priscilla , '' Councillor
Carter	PERSON	's eldest daughter , he says : '' She is small of her age , has a mild winning Pres - ence , a sweet obliging Temper , never swears , which is here a distinguished virtue , dances finely , plays well on key 'd instruments , and is on the whole in the first Class of the female Sex . ''

		The condition of the negroes is deeply de - plored by
Fithian	PERSON	, as it was later by Channing under very similar circumstances .

		A peck of corn and a pound of meat was the total weekly allowance of provision to each slave on the
Carter	PERSON	plantation .

		The inhuman punishments inflicted on offenders by neighboring slave - owners are described . ''

		There is a righteous God , '' adds the diarist , '' who will take venge - ance on such Inventions . ''

		The Journal records the traits of school-boy and school-girl nature , ever old yet ever new , which the writer notes in his young charges from day to day .

		Bob is flogged by his father for trying to shirk the dancing lesson by con - cealing till the last moment his shoeless condi - tion .

		Another pupil is in trouble with vulgar fractions .

		The girls amuse their teacher by aping the ways of their elders .

		A note for the naturalist is the
New Jersey	LOCATION	diarist 's sur - prised comment on
Virginia	LOCATION	's exemption from mosquitoes late in
July	DATE	, too !

		Apparently the
Jersey	LOCATION	variety of that insect was famous even in colonial times .

		The latest entry from the Journal is dated
Oct. 25 , 1774	DATE	.

		A selection from
Fithian	PERSON	's later correspondence and diaries , if such are preserved , ought to be of value .

		The editor 's Introduction leaves the reader at least a faint hope that another volume may be forthcoming .

		A DICTIONARY OF ARCHITECTURE .

		* Up to the present time some excuse was to be made for the architect , in this country , and for the student and lover of the building arts , who have not had within easy reach an
English Dictionary of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	.

		An important and expensive Dictionary of Architecture was com - pleted some
seven years ago	DATE	, after forty years spent in its making , by a society organized for its publication in
England	LOCATION	, but few copies found their way to this country , and the field has been open to whomever should enter it with a satisfactory work of the kind .

		Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	's recent work , '' A Dictionary of Architecture and Building , '' has , therefore , every opportunity of success .

		It is now prac - tically completed , one volume being in print , one in press , and the third and final one in manuscript .

		Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	, who has borne the heavy burden of editorship , came to his task well equipped to perform the duties assigned to him , and his assistants are all men eminent in the arts and crafts of which they write .

		Glossaries and encyclopaedic articles exist , and the general dictionaries may be depended upon for definitions , and also for pronunciation , along which line the work under consideration makes no move .

		It comprehends , however , the function of glossary and encyclopaedia , defining words and subjects alphabetically arranged , and expanding definitions into de - scriptive articles varying in length from a short paragraph to several thousand words .

		A sys - tem of cross references , well applied and exten - sive , enables the student to view a particular object from many sides and to behold it in its relation to kindred sorts , while to each special article is appended a list of books , etc. , in which the subject under consideration may be further and more broadly studied .

		This feature makes this Dictionary of great value in a ref - erence library .

		The definitions in the main have been fur - * A DICTIONARY OF ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING , Bio - graphical , Historical , and Descriptive .

		THE DIAL 303 nished by Mr. Van Brunt and Professor Ham - lin .

		Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	has contributed many articles but has left the longer to specialists in the various fields : thus Messrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	.

		Crow - inshield , and La Farge write on painting and color decoration ; Messrs.
Hutton	PERSON	and
Purdy	PERSON	write on structural engineering ; Mr.
William Paul Gerhard	PERSON	writes ou sanitary science ; Mr.
W. R. Letharby	PERSON	on design ; Professor
W. C. Sabine	PERSON	on acoustics ; Mr.
Charles A. Platt	PERSON	on gardens ; while Messrs.
R. Phene Spiers	PERSON	,
C. H. Blackall	PERSON	,
R. Clipston Sturgis	PERSON	, and Professor
Hamlin	PERSON	write of the Architecture of
Asia	LOCATION	- Minor ,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	, respec - tively .

		Mr.
Barr Ferree	PERSON	has furnished a list of the more important churches of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, with notes on each , to supplement the article on Churches .

		Sixty specialists , of whom the above are fairly representative , have con - tributed to the work .

		Not only in the historical and descriptive departments is the work strong , but also in the department of biography .

		Mr.
E. R. Smith	PERSON	, of the
Avery Architectural Library	ORGANIZATION	, has con - tributed liberally in this field , furnishing the bulk of the material furnishing , as a matter of fact , a goodly portion of the entire con - tents of the Dictionary .

		To each of the biog - raphies Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has appended a list of the buildings designed by the architect in question , and also , following the system used throughout the Dictionary , has added a list of the works which may be studied in further pursuit of the subject .

		In the matter of ascribing buildings to their proper designers , the work has been done in so thorough and scholarly a manner , original sources being sought and carefully sounded , that the result is a trustworthy pre - sentation of the fruits of the best knowledge .

		Referring again to the contributors , it is noted that of the sixty or more on the list , two are Frenchmen resident in
France	LOCATION	, two En - glishmen resident in
England	LOCATION	, one an American resident in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the remainder all of them resident in
America	LOCATION	, so that , while Amer - ica has not developed a national architectural style , it can not be laid at her door that she has not artistic and technical knowledge , skill , and vitality , sufficient to produce a compre - hensive Dictionary of Architecture .

		The work commends itself alike to the prac - ticing architect and to the layman , and pos - sesses so high an order of merit , and is so much of an undertaking , that it were almost ungracious to look for flaws .

		But faults do manifest themselves , both in the text , which contains examples of distorted perspective , and among the illustrations , which now and again are lacking in lucidity and pointedness .

		For instance , the
Alhambra	LOCATION	is dismissed with eight short lines and two illustrations which in no way represent the structure , while Casas Grandes receives four times the number of lines and no illustration .

		The
Alhambra	LOCATION	is one of the best known piles in the literature of history and romance , and a sympathetic word concerning it would not have , been amiss .

		The presentation of the drawing of the struc - tural work in the '' Court of the Lions '' is as though one dealing with the topic of Humanity should present a model skeleton in illustration .

		As there is no cross reference to `` Moorish Architecture '' or to '' Court , '' the subject pre - sumptively is dismissed .

		The cut which is intended to illustrate the term '' Alley '' does so very blindly , in fact not at all ; while the building represented appears again in a full page half-tone plate to illustrate the term , '' Cor - belling , '' which it does with equal blindness .

		The plate , however , makes a pleasing picture , which probably accounts for its introduction .

		The Editor deserves sincere thanks for drawing his illustration of '' Collegiate '' Architecture from the '' real thing '' rather than yielding to any temptation to present the exotic types which in their Eastern form are '' Academy '' Architecture , and in their proposed Western form are of the '' Exposition '' type of building .

		It is in the illustrations , however , that the work is weakest .

		They are drawn , as the text says , from many sources , and evidently no pains have been taken to create a uniformity either in method of reproduction or in scale .

		Reproductions of not too perfect wood-cuts are met on the same page with not too perfect re - productions of crude pen-drawings .

		The idea of proportioning the size and number of plates to the importance of the subject , seems not to have presented itself .

		While there are but few illustrations one would wish to have omitted altogether , there are points at which other illustrations would have been of service , notably in the fairly comprehensive article on Apart - ment Houses , which is illuminated with a half - tone plate of a Parisian Apartment house but contains no plan from the French , who are masters in this special line of design .

		But the defects are lost , almost , in the mass of well edited , pertinent material , and the shortcomings , possibly , are the unavoidable accompaniment of the speed with which the work has been produced ; for that , considering 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the magnitude of the work , was remarkable , and the Dictionary as it stands is to be grate - fully received as a most necessary adjunct to the working library of the Architect , and a very de - sirable reference book on the shelves of the man of general culture .

		GILBERT WHITE OF SEL.BORXE .

		* How mysterious , how incalculable , are the quality and the circumstance which give the work of a man 's hand and brain a hold on immortality .

		How little can he who puts his imprint on the product of his thought and sends it forth to effect its purpose in the world , foresee the influence it shall have and the length of life it shall attain .

		A hundred and fifty years ago there dwelt in an obscure village in the southern portion of
England	LOCATION	a quiet-minded clergyman , following the simple routine of daily duty which his tastes and his profession opened out to him .

		He was uncompanioned in his pursuits , and the solitary master of the '' Wakes , '' a picturesque old house surrounded by ample grounds in - cluding garden , orchard , meadow , and wood - land .

		The spirit of the naturalist animated him , affording him in his seclusion sources of endless , unaffected delight .

		Every object within the range of his activities excited curi - ous inquiry and stimulated him to close obser - vation and research .

		He studied the character and habits of the wild creatures round about , he learned the ways of the trees and the plants , he noticed the peculiarities of the soil and the rocks , and of the past life they entomb , and marked the variations in the seasons with a vigilant scrutiny .

		Not an aspect or a mood of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	passed him unnoted , and each , marked by a feature of importance , was stamped with minute par - ticularity upon his retentive memory .

		There was an incessant gathering of interesting facts which had not before been reported for the benefit of science at large .

		The gentle curate had no means of measuring the value of his investigations .

		He was following the bent of his inclinations in single-heartedness and purity of aim .

		Love set him on to the work , and the * THE NATURAL HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES of

		honesty of his mind kept him true to the per - formance of it .

		Selborne lies but fifty miles southwest from
London	LOCATION	, and it was the custom of the parish curate to leave his retreat by times for a brief communication with the life of the metropolis .

		He went up in the
Spring of 1767	DATE	, and came in contact with a man of like interests with himself ,
Thomas Pennant	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, a scientific writer of considerable authority , especially in the department of ornithology .

		Thence arose a correspondence between the two gentlemen which has made the name of
Gilbert White	ORGANIZATION	famous in the annals of natural history .

		For thirteen years these missives were de - spatched from the '' Wakes '' at
Selborne	LOCATION	, each one couched in formal yet unaffected style , and each laden with carefully considered , carefully recorded observations of the phenomena of Nature in the restricted region of the parish .

		The scope , variety , and accuracy of the writer 's investigations alike excite our wonder , while the simplicity , the tenderness , the oblivion of self manifest in his character draw us to him with affectionate admiration .

		He was the first of the students of Nature to glean his knowl - edge exclusively from personal investigation , who affirmed only that which he had proved , who was patient and trustworthy in experiment and conclusion .

		And these prime qualities , unconsciously entertained by him , have been duly appreciated among men of science .

		The letters to
Thomas Pennant	PERSON	, and a simi - lar set addressed to the Honorable
Daines Barrington	PERSON	, were published in
1789	DATE	under the general title of '' The Natural History of Sel - bourne . ''

		A translation into the German ap - peared in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1792	DATE	.

		The death of
Gil	PERSON	- bert White occurred in
1793	DATE	, and since that date over eighty editions of his book have been produced .

		Naturalists of eminence , as Sir
William Jardine	PERSON	, Professor Bell ,
Frank Buckland	PERSON	, and
Grant Allen	PERSON	, have in turn taken the work in hand , and by additional letters and other matter , revised and annotated , en - hanced the worth of the original form .

		It is included in Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's list of '' the best hundred books , '' and is regarded universally as a classic in the library of the naturalist .

		Dr.
Bowdler Sharpe	PERSON	, of the British Museum , who is the editor of the beautiful edition of '' Selborne '' now before us , remarks in his introduction to the volumes : '' I have pondered a hundred times on the wonder - ful fact that the world should take such a heart-felt interest in the work of a retiring and modest eighteenth -

		... Apart from
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	,
Windsor Castle	ORGANIZATION	, and other places of historical interest in the
British Islands	LOCATION	, there is probably no place , save
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, to which the pilgrims of the Anglo-Saxon race render more respectful tribute than to the lowly head-stone which marks the grave of
Gilbert White of Selborne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The occupant of that simple grass-grown grave would probably have been the most astonished of all people in the world could he have realized that his celebrity as an Englishman would have come near to equalling that of Shakespeare ; and yet there exists at the present date as much affection , among naturalists at least , for the sayings and doings of
Gilbert White	PERSON	as is felt for the records of Shake - speare and his time . ''

		But little is known of the life-history of
Gilbert White	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his writings self was put behind him , yet it could not be kept out of sight .

		Enough was visible to make us long to know more .

		He was a fellow of
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	Col - lege ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and held a curacy under his uncle
Charles	PERSON	, Rector of
Bradley	PERSON	and Vicar of Swarraton .

		His family were people of position , and he had evidently leisure and means .

		A biography is promised in the near future by the present editor of his works , and from his enthusiasm and the material at his command , we may expect as full and authentic a narrative as can at this late date be made out .

		The two-volume edition which Dr.
Sharpe	PERSON	now presents , is in all respects worthy of praise .

		Every pains has been taken to do justice to the memory and the achievements of
Gilbert White	PERSON	, and the book stands as the loving tribute of one of the foremost of modern naturalists to one who served science nobly in its early stages a century and more ago .

		The vol - umes are richly illustrated with nearly two hun - dred full-page drawings and an almost equal number of smaller size .

ICA	ORGANIZATION	.

Alfred Caldecott	PERSON	,
D.D. New York	LOCATION	: The Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		where is it more declared than in religion .

		Religious belief , which had become remote , obscure , and speculative , is now earnestly interrogated on all sides , and incessantly asked for its vouchers .

		And yet in spite of this clamor of inquiry which has been so annoying to many persons , the period is marked by an accumulation of religious facts and religious experiences which places it above , not below , beyond , and not in the rear of , other periods .

		This is seen in the books before us .

		A portion are theoretical , apologetic , and comparatively inef - fective .

		Another portion are practical , and stand for a temper that is conquering the world . ''

		Reasons for Faith in Christianity '' and '' Scien - tific Evidences of Revealed Religion , '' though quite diverse in form , are very like in purpose and spirit .

		The main object of each of them is the defense of the
Bible	LOCATION	as a special , preeminent , divine revela - tion , a revelation that does not so much crowd other revelations into the background as exclude them altogether .

		Dr.
Leavitt	PERSON	, the author of the first volume , is exclamatory in style , and expects to carry the defenses of the enemy with a rush .

		His words are full of enthusiasm , and are fitted to give much satisfaction to those who entertain the same opinions as the speaker the method is that of a speaker rather than that of a writer and who wish only to have them confirmed .

		Dr.
Leavitt	PERSON	has information rather than knowledge .

		He does not make a well-defined point and bring his knowledge to bear closely upon it .

		He covers a wide range of themes , such as one might find in a series of dis - courses .

		What he says on hypercriticism would have point if it were only put less sweepingly .

		Dr.
Shields	PERSON	, the author of the second book , has a lucid , pleasing , and persuasive style , and one whose first impression is of carefulness and candor .

		This first judgment is not fully sustained when we weigh up the entire discussion .

		He regards the divine revelation in the Scriptures as '' infallible and in - errant , the very word of God . ''

		And yet , when he has made all the allowances which he is inclined to make for the personal qualities of the writer , the circumstances of the time , the intelligence of those to whom the word was addressed , and the errors incident to transcription , we are hardly able to see in what this special divine element consists .

		The nature of inspiration can not be blurred advantage - ously in such a discussion as this of the evidence of revelation .

		In what exactly does a special inspira - tion consist , and what is the proof of it ?

		Much of the proof that the author offers is not pertinent to the discussion .

		If the fact that the astronomical implications of the Scriptures are more frequently than otherwise consistent with the facts of
Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omy proves special inspiration , then the text-books on Astronomy , still more exact in their agreement , should also be a Revelation .

		The author lays considerable emphasis on the assertion that we can not regard the
Bible	LOCATION	as errant in science and history and inerrant in ethics and religion .

		To this we make no objection .

		Indeed , 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, portions of the Bible seem more plainly errant in morals than in any other direction .

		There could hardly be a spiritual enigma more insoluble and confusing than the assertion that God sent pesti - lence to consume the people because
David	PERSON	had unwisely numbered them .

		Neither of these authors seems to have the slightest apprehension that Christianity is not very closely associated with these theories , and is not likely to suffer from their failure .

		On the other hand , this notion of inspiration they regard as lying at the very centre of belief .

		It may be important to a given doctrinal system , but it has very little to do with a divine life .

		The next two volumes are of a very different spirit .

		Though not offered as defenses of Christian - ity , they subserve that purpose more effectively than the two which precede them on our list . ''

		The Age of Faith '' indicates an author more impressed by the new hold of men 's minds on re - ligious truth , than by the sceptical attacks which the outworn attitudes of belief have suffered .

		In - deed , this very scepticism is often but another expression of faith .

		The burden of the book is the Fatherhood of God , and it is fitted to bring in - struction , courage , and contentment to many minds .

		Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	is an excellent example of a '' suc - cessful preacher '' both words used in their best sense suited to the time in which he lives .

		Dogma plays but a small part in his volume .

		The iron in the smelting pot is thoroughly fused , and comes forth a glowing stream ready for the mould in which it is to be cast .

		The method of presenta - tion is literary and impressional rather than philo - sophical .

		A mind and heart , warmed by the divine goodness , strive to make that goodness more tangible to man , and this with reasons that appeal to every man 's life .

		That the underlying philosophy does not always touch bottom is seen in the brief Introduction , which affirms two incompatible things : Revelation brought to the test of reason , and an infallible guide .

		In - fallibility can not be a living pertinent fact to a thoroughly fallible man , whose primary dependence is his own reason . ''

		Jesus Christ and the Social Question '' is a book to which we wish to give the warmest welcome , both for its own sake , and because of the aptness of its message .

		It is a book of diligent inquiry and wise insight not of information but of knowledge .

		No one interested , both in social growth and Christianity , can afford to overlook it .

		It is the spirit of Christianity brought to the very world in which that most divine revelation has been made .

		It helps to unite - the two , the mind of Christ and the wants of men , in a
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here is defence where alone an adequate defence can be found , in a simple exposition of the
Christ	LOCATION	- like temper as a fact among the facts of this human spiritual world of whose needs we know something .

		It treats specifically of the teaching of Christ in connection with the family , with wealth , the care of the poor , and industrial order .

		If the flood of religious literature casts ashore occasionally such a volume as this , let it remain at high-water mark .

		Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	is so profoundly interested both prac - tically and speculatively in the present wide and general changes of faith as to make his words stimulating , aside from any exact agreement with his conclusions .

		He offers a favorable example of a deeper concurrence in the present force of our religious life than that formed in a system of belief . ''

		The New Epoch for Faith '' expresses the en - thusiasm with which he regards the present move - ments in the religious world .

		The last portion of the volume is occupied with a forecast of the de - velopments which are to be anticipated in social and spiritual life ; and the body of the book , with the influences which are to contribute to this growth .

		Chief among these influences are the broader , deeper sense of human life ; the new appreciation of the true Christian temper which comes with it ; the discipline of doubt ; the rooting of faith in fresh soil ; the better interpretation of history .

		Salvation is thus deeply incorporated in the human spirit , and in its spiritual unfolding .

		It is no more to be missed or to miscarry than are the great purpose and process of Creation .

		One can not anticipate many readers for '' The Philosophy of Religion , '' though he can not fail to recognize the knowledge and industry of the author .

		It is a history of the doctrine of theism in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	since the reformation .

		Indeed , simply as an historical sketch , it is capricious , omitting and including authors according to the interest felt in them by the writer .

		As a critical production , it is too fearfully analytic .

		Everything falls apart .

		There is no synthetic purpose , no pushing of con - clusions to a definite result .

		Thus , more than ninety compact octavo pages are expended on an analysis of theism , which issues in thirteen distinct varieties , each to be presented at length in a series of writers .

		One must have great interest in naked facts to get pleasure out of such a presentation .

		This simple rehearsal of facts without handling them is to most persons wearisome and barren .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The
Italy	LOCATION	of the artists .

		A book on '' Italian Cities '' -LRB- Scrib - ners -RRB- , by Mr. and Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	, makes us at first feel a desire for pictures ; we want illustrations .

		This may be rather unreasonable , for we believe that the painting of cities is not exactly Mr.
Blashfield	PERSON	's forte .

		Perhaps we are led astray by recollection of Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's drawings and etchings for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		These sketches -LRB- non-pictorial -RRB- are very different from those of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who writes as an observing traveller , having his guide-book quite frankly in hand or in his trunk .

		Such a one needs pictures , and is lucky to have Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	instead of having
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 to depend on photographers .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Blash	PERSON	- field do not themselves appear much in their book .

		The papers are historical and artistic , chiefly -LRB- of course -RRB- on history and art in the Renaissance .

		Well-worn as much about
Italy	LOCATION	has become , we have here a good deal which if not new is at least not hackneyed .

		Rather out-of-the-way places ,
Florence	LOCATION	, of course , and
Siena	LOCATION	, but also
Ravenna	LOCATION	,
Spoleto	LOCATION	,
Parma	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- because of
Correggio	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Cortona	LOCATION	,
Assisi	LOCATION	,
Mantua	LOCATION	.

		Still , so much is written of
Italy	LOCATION	and read even to-day , that it is a bold hand that writes a new book .

		Not only Mr.
Howells	PERSON	comes to mind , but the differing reminiscences of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	with his earthwork ,
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	and his so-called sensations , not to mention
Vernon Lee	PERSON	's tortuous dialogues and musings among the ilex-groves and other such places .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Blashfield	PERSON	do not strike a new note a good deal of the book is of the highly-colored imaginative tapestry sort of revival of the glowing and glorious life of the Renaissance centuries , and for this , we confess , we do not care .

		It is apt to surfeit ; it is sweetness not long-drawn-out but thick-spread-on .

		Aside from this '' word-painting , '' however , there is a good deal that is simpler and surer in touch , and that really gives some of the specific aspects of the time and more particularly some of the artistic qualities of the masters .

		Thus it is pleasant to hear that
Giotto	PERSON	did not neglect stuffs , and paint blades of grass because he wished to glorify God , but because he was quite sincere in being as real - istic as he could be and in pushing his work as far as he could go : since he was unable to paint stuffs as well as blades of grass , he omitted detail in one and inserted it in the other .

		This example of the way an artist looks at the thing is interesting to a generation fed on the art-criticism of moralists .

		There is a good deal that is interesting in the book ; two volumes are a little cloying , but no one need read them all at once .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	have made a hand - 8ome book o Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's interesting articles on `` East Lon - don , '' with the illustrations by Messrs.
Phil May	PERSON	,
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.

London	LOCATION	, has little to do with history or antiqui - ties , for the reason that the area described in it can hardly be said to have either .

		East

Bishopsgate Street Without	ORGANIZATION	and north of the Thames , the region east of the river Lea , and the aggregation of now conterminous towns that were once the suburban villages called
Hackney	PERSON	,
Clapton	PERSON	,
Stoke Newington	LOCATION	,
Stepney	PERSON	, etc. is virtually a modern industrial city , a swarming hive of trade and manufacture , as unlike its ancient neighbor of Westminster as sooty
Glasgow	LOCATION	is unlike the picturesque and storied con - geries of wynds and courts and time-worn structures that form Old
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		The distinctive note of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's book on
East London	LOCATION	, as compared `` Man - building . ''

		with its predecessors on ''
South London	LOCATION	, '' '' West - minster , '' etc. , is its human and modern interest , its close portrayal of the elements and types that the seeing eye discerns in the outwardly common and prosaic hurly-burly of toil and traffic , coarse pleasure-taking , and headlong hunt of the guinea or , alas !

		more often of the irreducible and indis - pensable halfpenny , that sums up life in the main at the
East End	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	's pen is graphic , his knowledge of his theme exhanstless , and his soul is full of sympathy for the toils and sorrows , the dim-lit lives of
London	LOCATION	's workers in the rank and file ; nor does the hopeless human derelict , adrift , rudderless , and bound to no haven here below , fail to win his charitable , appealing word .

		The pic - tures have the uplifting touch of art , and a word of praise must be given to the felicitous cover-design .

		When the author of '' Man-building '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Dr.
Lewis Ransom Fiske	PERSON	, tells us that he '' sought a title for this book which would clearly express its character , '' he explains without enlightening .

		This '' Treatise on Human Life and its Forces '' is composed of an introductory , a psychological , a physiological , and a sociological part .

		Out of this composite is supposed to emerge a potent elixir that shall arouse the talents , quicken the energies , and enlarge the opportunities of the young .

		The volume is in fact added to an al - ready swollen literature without any genuine raison d'etre .

		It is composed without insight , written without adornment or attraction , scattered through and through with vague and pointless generalities , displays a painfully weak grasp on the vital issues that are presented , and has no powers to charm , instruct , impress , enlighten , or -LRB- to add in fairness -RRB- mislead .

		Good intentions do not furnish a highway for profitable or attractive travel ; on the contrary we are proverbially informed that paving of this kind is in use in the dwelling-places of moral failure .

		Neither do fervor and interest furnish the means for an intellectual success .

		Criticism is misdirected against such a work as '' Man-building '' ; it is suf - ficient to point out its negative significance , its fail - ure to contribute anything to the information or the inspiration or the accessibility of the world 's knowledge .

		It has , indeed , the weakly exhortative and strongly tiresome tone that we encounter when we take down from a neglected shelf a dusty volume of ' moral and mental philosophy '' of a half-century or more ago .

		As an unvarnished account of actual life before the mast in the merchant and the naval service , we have read few books as good as Mr.
Stanton H. King	PERSON	's '' Dog - Watches at Sea '' -LRB- Honghton -RRB- .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	, who sailed the brine , as boy and man , for twelve years , is now superintendent of the Sailors ' Haven ,
Charlestown	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, a snug berth no doubt to bring up in after much knocking about in all sorts of ships and all sorts of weather .

		What we like most about Mr.
King	PERSON	is that he is content to tell a plain Plaintaltt if the tea .

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, tale without '' penny-dreadful '' trimmings , and that he .

		does not plainly lay himself out -LRB- as even Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	does sometimes -RRB- to '' make your flesh creep , '' as the fat boy in
Pickwick	ORGANIZATION	said to Mr.
Wardle	PERSON	.

		Mr.
King	PERSON	's adventures , stirring enough many of them , were of the regular kind that every sailor is bound to have if he sails long enough .

		He has a sensible word to say of the American deep-water ships , usually described as unmitigated `` floating hells '' officered by fiends incarnate .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	admits that he has at times seen men wantonly abused by '' bucko mates '' on these vessels ; but he asserts , what everyone of experience knows to be true , that the precarious rule of the half-dozen of - ficers of a deep-water ship over the average ship 's crew is in many cases only to be maintained by violence or a show of it .

		A sort of reign of terror has to be instituted at the start as the only alter - native to shirking , insubordination , and possible mutiny .

		Your '' Christian captain '' would get on beautifully with a Christian crew ; but the gang that usually herds in the forecastle of a deep-water ship is anything but Christian the more shame to us for it .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	's in its kind capital book is handsomely printed , and it contains four accep - table pictures after drawings by
Charles Copeland	PERSON	.

		Recollections of The little volume containing the M/Tme2Lw '' Recollections of a
Georgia Loyal	ORGANIZATION	- Revoiution .

		igt '' -LRB-
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Elizabeth Lich	PERSON	- tenstein
Johnston	PERSON	, tells in artless style the story of the adventures and wanderings , during and after the war of the American Revolution , of the daugh - ter of one of the numerous Southern families who remained true to King and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	after the Colonies had declared for independence .

		After the success of the '' rebellion '' was assured there was a great exodus of '' Tories , '' for of amnesty to the vanquished there was little or no sign .

		The author of the '' Recollections '' fled first to
Florida	LOCATION	, then to
Scotland	LOCATION	, then to the
West Indies	LOCATION	, and finally to
Novia Scotia	LOCATION	, where she settled , and where her descendants now form a family of social and political note .

		The narrative was penned by Mrs.
Johnston	PERSON	in
1836	DATE	, when she was seventy-two .

		As a family memorial it is doubtless of much interest ; and the general reader may find in it glimpses of a side of our early history not so familiar as it should be .

		The relation of '' The Clergy in American Life and the clergy to Letters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Rev. American letters .

		Dan j el Du l anv
Addison	PERSON	, aims , as the preface states , mainly '' to tell the story of the influence upon American life and letters of the clergy during the national era of American litera - ture . ''

		The important qualification in the last clause accounts for the dismissal of
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	with half-a-dozen lines , and for the estimate of
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	in thrice as many .

		The plan of the book is to treat the work of a great many clergymen in four introductory chapters , and then to give a chapter each to
Timothy Dwight	PERSON	,
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	,
Theodore Parker	PERSON	,
Horace Bush	PERSON	- nell ,
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	, and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	.

		It may be doubted whether this assignment does not lay a disproportionate emphasis upon the six preachers selected , especially in view of the osten - sible purpose to show the relation of the clergy to American letters .

		It is , however , the preacher as such that one principally sees , although the titles of literary works , and frequently something more , are conscientiously given .

		A strictly literary his - torian would have allowed greater space to strictly literary work , and would have regarded the whole more consistently from the literary standpoint .

		The opening chapters call for a power to seize upon essentials , and to express them in clear and concise English , a power not always conspicu - ously present ; but the chapters furnishing oppor - tunity to treat individual preachers at length are generally just , appreciative , and vigorous .

		It is no more than fair to say that the author manifestly is dealing with a familiar subject , upon which his genuine interest and prolonged study have been industriously employed .

		An interesting series of sea `` yarns '' and ^ collections written by Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	for the '' Spectator '' are neatly reprinted in a volume of some 380 pages entitled '' A Sack of Shakings '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		`` Shakings , '' we find , is the name given to the odds and ends of rope and canvas accumu - lated on sailing-ships during a voyage , which were formerly the perquisites of the Mate .

		The term aptly describes the somewhat miscellaneous contents of the present volume , which is , however , lifted above the average book of its class by the really magical bits of description that stud its pages .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	has the gift of the seeing eye and the luminous word , and there is at times a touch of something akin to genius in his writing .

		But we wish he would eschew dialect and the melo - dramatic , pitfalls into which he is somewhat prone to stray .

		Continued interest in
J. Fenimore	LOCATION	er is attested by the inviting little biography by Mr.
W. B. Shu	PERSON	- brick
Clymer	PERSON	, in the series known as '' The Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of neces - sity considerably dependent upon
Lounsbury	PERSON	, the author yet makes profitable use of hitherto unpub - lished letters , and clearly knows the nooks and cor - ners of his subject at first hand .

		Within the narrow limits of his volume he finds room for an interesting account of the public disputes that embittered
Cooper	PERSON	's latter years , in which appear the novelist 's fearlessness , his love of justice , and his accuracy as a naval historian .

		Cooper , it appears , was usually right in his main contention , and , moreover , was sustained by the courts .

		He made favorable im - pression upon such men as Parkman the historian ,
Morse	PERSON	the inventor of the telegraph , and Balzac of the '' Come ` die Humaine . ''

		His biographer shows
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 that
Cooper	PERSON	, despite his long unpopularity with his countrymen , was throughout a lover of
America	LOCATION	and her institutions .

		No one will now deny his title as creator of at least one or two wholly original characters in English fiction .

		Mr.
Clymer	PERSON	does not spare
Cooper	PERSON	's novels of lower rank , while suffi - ciently praising his best .

		The biographer 's style is necessarily condensed , now and then almost blunt , sometimes picturesque , and always clear .

		Now that the public curiosity aroused by ' An Englishwoman 's Love Letters ' has been somewhat satiated , we should like to call attention to a work which is more deserving of the interest of that world that loves a lover .

		Some time ago
Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	published a book entitled ' The Love of an Uncrowned Queen , ' which for pure passion and genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest the fictitious and artificial ' letters ' said to be the work of Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	.

		Nothing could be more significant of the tyranny of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An Englishwoman 's Love Letters ' on the one hand and the utter lack of interest in ' The Love of an Uncrowned Queen ' on the other .

		TWO NEW NOVELS `` Thrilling and Realistic . ''

R. L. OUTHWAITE	PERSON	and
C. H. CHOMLEY	PERSON	.

		12mo , pp. 345 , cloth ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		A story by two writers thoroughly at home in the atmosphere of Australian adven - ture and bush life , who have filled their work with the local color of the country and caught the character of the people as few have done .

		It is brimful of movement and action of the most thrilling and yet realistic kind .

		The descriptions of Australian life and scenery are in the highest degree picturesque , and the incident of a terrible bush fire , its steady advance , and the almost superhuman efforts of the hero 's family and friends to escape from it to safety , is one of the notable passages in recent fiction .

		The authors have shown as great skill in depicting the diverse strains of human character and the play of human passions and emotions as they have in leading the story to a dramatic climax ; and they have made a book that few will be willing to lay down till it has been read through .

		The historical background of the story is well maintained also , and the whole book seems written with a loving interest and care which adds much to the sincerity of the author 's purpose . ''

		There is a grace of style about it , too .

		The stately diction of the fifteenth century is well maintained , and each sentence is rounded and finished in a charmingly musical manner .

		One can not speak too highly of the purity of the tale , which should gain for the book a wide - spread interest apart from any historical merit it may possess . ''

		Here one moves in the society of the old nobility .

		The nobility of the Beauforts , the

		The work is not an arid technical study : it is the expression of a warm and loyal appreciation .

		There is no spirit of controversy or of faddism in the sugges - tions as to health : they are pervaded by a gentle spirit that easily wins the reader to confidence in their reasonableness .

		348 TENDENCIES IN LITERATURE .

		To the seasoned critic , there are few things so amusing as the habit the amateur observer has of indulging in broad generalizations con - cerning contemporary literature .

		Some book proves to be the fashion of the hour , and straightway it is made the subject of philoso - phizing .

		What is merely a ripple upon the surface of popular taste is viewed as a fresh and deep current of human thought , and this supposedly new departure of the spirit serves as a starting-point for many a solemn disquisi - tion upon types and schools and movements .

		These grave inductions from a single instance , or a few instances , however philosophical the parade of the terms in which they are presented , betray their essentially unphilosophical char - acter by the obvious inadequacy of their basis of fact .

		They are made only to be forgotten , as , in the majority of cases , the books that occasioned them are forgotten , after the lapse of a few years .

		It is not so very long ago that the American public was reading and talking `` Trilby , '' with such frantic enthusiasm that one would have thought a new literary era had dawned .

		Many were the seeming-wise reflect - ions of which this entertaining story was the innocent provoking cause , many were the hopes , or the fears , for our literary development that took their starting point from the vogue of this particular piece of fiction .

		All this discussion was the work of the amateur , and we now realize how absurd it all was .

		The novel in question is clean forgotten to-day , and with it the whole argument based upon its success .

		Anyone can see now what the practised critic saw all the time , that there was no more significance in the astonishing vogue of '' Tril - by '' than there had been a score of years earlier in the equally astonishing vogue of ``
Helen	PERSON	's Babies . ''

		In point of fact , when the philosophical student of literature confronts the question of literary tendencies , he sees two things with ab - solute distinctness .

		One of them is that the study of tendencies , of movements , of the transformations of a nation 's idealisms , is the 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, most important thing about the history of any literature , the only thing , indeed , that invests a literature with real significance for the his - tory of culture .

		If he can not discern the evo - lutionary process at work , he misses all the salt and savor of his subject , and his conclu - sions are empirical or merely subjective .

		The other thing is that this process of development , this history of movements and transformations , requires for its proper observation a consider - able period to be taken into survey , and a con - siderable detachment , in point of time , from that period .

		The one well-nigh impossible task is to trace the direction of the evolutionary process in one 's immediate surroundings , or to make any prophecies for the future save those that are the logical outcome of some tendency that has been in operation long enough to be - come clearly discerned .

		Suppose one were to take some representa - tive collection of contemporary literature , such , for example , as the closing section of either of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's great anthologies , and read it through intent only upon the detection of tend - encies , or of unifying principles , he would find it an extremely difficult matter to reduce to order his confused and varied impressions .

		In such a case , it is impossible to see the woods for the trees .

		To discern the tendencies at work in such a mass of literary production , to find the pattern in so complex a web of intel - lectual activity , to distinguish the currents from the eddies in so wide an expanse of waters , would be a task well worth attempting , indeed , but one likely to baffle the most persistent ef - fort .

		Of course the problem might to a certain extent be simplified by discarding the great mass of the work as merely reflecting the hues caught from the greater poems , as merely echo - ing the significant ideas of the age put forth by the few writers who set the pitch for the symphony .

		The lesser writers contribute to the harmony -LRB- or the discord -RRB- and the tone - coloring of the composition , but they do not modify the fundamental character of the move - ment .

		Nevertheless , the difficulty is not really removed by this process of elimination ; it is somewhat lessened , and that is all .

		A few generalizations , however , concerning the tendencies and characteristics of our con - temporary English literature it seems reason - ably safe to make , and one of them is that we are living in a critical rather than a creative period .

		As the few great survivors of the earlier age one by one pass away , we feel acutely conscious that the places are left un - filled .

		The season of analysis and introspec - tion is clearly upon us .

		In such a period as ours , versatility , good taste , and excellence of workmanship , and the number of good writers , as distinguished from the great masters , is as - tonishingly large .

		Sometimes they spring up in the most unexpected quarters , and anticipa - tion flutters at the thought of a possible resurg - ence of the creative impulse .

		But we must not deceive ourselves into thinking that our bustling literary activity is swelling to any appreciable or noticeable extent the stock of the world 's masterpieces .

		Our literature of to-day is various and entertaining , it has taste and even distinction , but it is not a literature adorned by the opulent blossoming of genius .

		If we may venture , after the preceding dis - claimer , to indicate any distinct tendencies in the English and American literature of the past few years , we would say that it has moved , and is still moving , in the direction of artistic freedom , of cosmopolitan interest , and of broad - ened social sympathy .

		It no longer suffers , for example , under the reproach of being pro- duced with an exaggerated deference to the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	.

		To place under the ban whole tracts of human life , to refrain from dealing with whole groups of the most important of human relations because their treatment gives offence to immature minds , is a procedure not justified by the larger view of what literature means .

		This lesson we have learned of recent years .

		If we take into account the newest of new women and the youngest of emancipated young men , it may seem that the lesson has been too well learned , but , on the whole , our literary art has gained strength with its newly acquired freedom .

		Our literature is also meas - urably freed from its old time provincialism of outlook .

		We have seen established for the mintage of the mind a broader compact than any
Latin Union	LOCATION	; if an idea have but intrinsic value , its currency does not now need to be forced in other countries than that of its origin .

		This , too , is a great gain , and will make the next creative period all the easier of approach .

		But the greatest gain of all , to our thinking , is the awakening of the new social sympathy that characterizes our recent literature .

		We hear a good deal of '' democratic art , '' and much of what we have thus far got is distress - ingly crude and dull with didacticism .

		But the future of our race belongs to democracy , and literature must make the best of this inevitable movement .

		That it will eventually learn how
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 to shape the idealism of democracy into forms of convincing beauty we make no doubt , and the signs are not wanting that such an issue is near at hand .

		We might make specific men - tion , to support this proposition , of the remark - able recent work of one of our younger poets , but since we propose to consider that at some length in the next issue of THE DIAL , , the hint shall suffice us here .

		An illustration of more resounding significance may be found in the work of the greatest of living Russians .

		The writings of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, or to be more exact , the earnest attention which they have received during the past few years , offer im - pressive example of the power of the social motive as embodied in the forms of fictive art , to make itself felt as a force in literature .

		Here is a writer whose whole genius is spent in an impassioned appeal to purely democratic sympathies , and , as the years go on , his figure assumes grander and grander proportions , and his utterance seems to become more and more invested with the attributes of prophecy .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		OUR LITERARY FOLK-LORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, or at least part of them , are interested no doubt in what may be called literary folk-lore .

		If so , I trust that some of them will be will - ing to assist in the collection of a very interesting body of such folk-lore now swiftly passing out of existence .

		That constituency of THE DIAL which had the good fortune to be raised in the country will doubtless re - member the way in which the young people of their neighborhood used to get around the sensitive con - sciences of Presbyterian elders and Methodist class - leaders , by calling their dances by the innocent name of `` singing games . ''

		When they wanted to dance at their parties they asked permission to '' play games , '' and then they would dance to the choral singing of '' Lead her up and down to your best liking , '' '' Weevilly Wheat , '' and `` Pop Goes the Weasel . ''

		Both words and music of these choral dance songs were in every case traditional .

		Some of them , like the singing games of children , were evidently the broken-down remains of old folk-ballads .

		A recent attempt to secure some of them shows that in fifteen years they have disappeared completely from one neighborhood , but there must be communities where they are still played or at least may be collected from the memories of those who played them in their youth .

		It is to be hoped , therefore , that this nineteenth century survival of old folk-poetry will receive the attention it deserves while there is yet time .

		Personally , I shall be grateful for any help to save the old songs .

		VARIATIONS IN
TENNYSON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was much interested in Professor
Albert	PERSON	.

		Jack 's notice of Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	's `` Early Poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' in a recent issue of THE DIAL .

		As he re - marks , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is wrong in assuming that his is the first attempt to record the various readings of these and other poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	; nor was the work that I did in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	''
Tennyson	PERSON	, to which Professor
Jack	PERSON	refers , the first of the kind .

		As long ago as
1857	DATE	, when I was reading '' The Princess '' with a high-school class , I happened to notice that variations occurred in different editions of the poem ; and I copied all these into the edition I was using .

		Later I found and recorded variations in other poems that we read in school .

		In
1883	DATE	I published an annotated edition of '' The Princess , '' in which I gave all the various readings , so far as I could ascertain them .

		For the first edition of the poem I had to depend on the American reprint , which I collated with the sec - ond
London	LOCATION	edition and the fourth and fifth American editions .

		I could not get hold of the third edition -LRB- 1850 -RRB- in which the intercalary songs first appeared , but the copy of the second edition that I used had these songs inserted in manuscript .

		For the third issue of my edition -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , I had the privilege of examining an interleaved copy of the first English edition of '' The Princess '' belonging to my friend Dr.
F. J. Furnivall	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, in which he had recorded the new readings of the third and fifth edi - tions .

		This enabled me to settle some doubtful points and to supply several omissions in my collation of those editions ; and also to detect sundry curious misprints in the first American edition and a few errors in the manuscript copy of the songs mentioned above .

		I had also received a very kind letter from
Lord Tennyson	LOCATION	, calling attention to one or two slips in notes quoted from Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's '' Study of The Princess . ' ''

		In
1884	DATE	I edited '' Select Poems of Tennyson , '' in - cluding many of those given by Mr.
Collins	PERSON	, and noted all the variations from the English edition of
1884	DATE	which I found in the American reprints from
1849	DATE	down .

		For the readings of the editions of
1830	DATE	,
1832	DATE	, and
1842	DATE	, I had to depend mainly on quotations in the reviews and in the commentaries of
Shepherd	LOCATION	,
Tainsh	LOCATION	,
Wace	ORGANIZATION	,
Bayne	PERSON	, and others .

		For the first edition of the
Wellington	LOCATION	Ode , I used a copy given to the
Harvard Library	ORGANIZATION	by the poet
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		In 1 887 , 1 edited ''
Enoch Arden	PERSON	and Other Poems '' on the same plan ; and for this and the second edition of the `` Select Poems '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- I had the opportunity of making a rather hurried examination of the
1830	DATE	and
1832	DATE	editions in the British Museum , which was supplemented by some work of the kind done for me by a person recommended by the Museum authorities , but in which I subsequently found many errors .

		Revised editions of these two books , with additional poems , were published in
1895	DATE	; and for these editions I was able to consult a good number of the English editions .

		In
1895	DATE	I also published an edition of '' In Memo - riam , '' much of the work on which had been done dur - ing the ten years previous .

		For the various readings I had the benefit of a copy of the first English edition given me by Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, in which he had recorded most of them .

		In
1896	DATE	I edited the '' Idylls of the King , '' using most 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, of the earlier English and American editions in the col - lation of the text .

		I also corrected the irregular and often inconsistent pointing , capitalization , etc. , of the English editions , and in an appendix filled nearly two pages of fine print with specimens of these errors and incongruities .

		In 1895-1897 I edited the complete de luxe edition of Tennyson brought out by
Messrs. Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	in twelve volumes , with variorum and other notes ; and in
1898	DATE	the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition , in which the various readings were given more concisely .

		I have spent perhaps half a dozen hours in examining Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's book , and have already noted many errors and omissions .

		Most of these , like those to which Pro- fessor
Jack	PERSON	refers , are '' very slight , '' but not a few of them are much worse than the general character of the work would have led me to expect .

		Some of them in - dicate apparent carelessness in collation , and others in proofreading .

		On p. 53 , for instance , two entire lines of a stanza of `` Mariana in the South , '' as printed in
1833	DATE	-LRB- 1832 -RRB- , are omitted : '' Backward the latticeblind she flung , And leaned upon the balcony . ''

		I give them as they appear in my ''
Enoch Arden	PERSON	, etc. , '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- .

		On p. 66 , the
1833	DATE	version of a line of the first song in `` The
Miller	PERSON	's Daughter '' -LRB- `` And I would lie so light , so light '' -RRB- is given simply '' So warm and light . ''

		It should be -LRB- if my edition is right -RRB- '' I would lie round so warm and light . ''

		This , by the way , is a specimen of a class of errors giving an early reading only in part .

		The use of the capital in `` So '' is misleading ; but in all such cases Mr.
Collins	PERSON	begins his quotations with a capital .

		Even the article a when given alone in a note -LRB- as in that on '' Like one great garden glowed , '' p. 26 , where the
1830	DATE	reading is '' a great garden '' -RRB- , is printed thus : `` 1830 .

		A. '' On p. 68 , the fact that two stanzas of '' The
Miller	PERSON	's Daughter '' were added in
1842	DATE	-LRB- the two preceding the last one , as the poem now stands -RRB- is not mentioned .

		Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	, in the '' Democratic Review '' for Janu - ary ,
1844	DATE	-LRB- Vol .

		xiv .

		p. 62 fol . -RRB-

		, is very severe in her comments upon this addition to the
1832	DATE	form of the poem .

		I quote the passage -LRB- nearly a page of it -RRB- in my '' Select Poems , '' p. 200 .

		On p. 95 , the three stanzas of the '' Palace of Art '' which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	gives in a foot-note of
1832	DATE	as omitted from the poem because it is '' already too long , '' are cited ; but Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is apparently not aware that the poet corrected the astronomical allusions in them when they were printed in Palgrave 's '' Lyrical Poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, ''
1885	DATE	.

		The original reading in the third stanza was : `` She saw the snowy poles of moonless Mars , That marvellous round of milky light Below
Orion	ORGANIZATION	, and those double stars , '' etc. .

		In
Palgrave	PERSON	's book it is given -LRB- according to my '' Select Poems , '' p. 218 -RRB- thus , without even a hint that it had been changed since
1832	DATE	: `` She saw the snowy poles and moons of Mars , That marvellous field of drifted light In mid
Orion	ORGANIZATION	, and the married stars , '' etc. .

		No critic , so far as I am aware , has noticed this varia - tion .

		Tennyson from his early years was intensely in - terested in astronomy , and is remarkably accurate in his frequent allusions to it .

		The moons of Mars were not discovered until long after this stanza was first written ; but it is curious that he should have put the famous nebula of
Orion	ORGANIZATION	'' below '' the constellation .

		Probably , however , he was thinking at the moment of the belt of the giant .

		This omission in Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's notes reminds me of another which is more surprising , for even if he never happened to see
Palgrave	PERSON	's book , he must be familiar with '' The Foresters . ''

		On p. 295 he gives the '' Nat - ional Song , '' printed in
1830	DATE	but afterwards suppressed for sixty-two years or until
1892	DATE	, when it was inserted in '' The Foresters , '' with no change except in the chorus of the two stanzas , which read thus in
1830	DATE	: '' CHORUS .

		For the French the Pope may shrive 'em , For the devil a whit we heed 'em : As for the French , God speed 'em Unto their heart 's desire , And the merry devil drive 'em Through the water and the fire . ''

		FULL CHORUS .

		Our glory is our freedom , We lord it o'er the sea ; We are the sons of freedom , We are free . ''

		I quote from the de luxe
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Vol .

		xi .

		p. 298 .

		For the chorus as it now stands the reader can refer to '' The Foresters . ''

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	notes neither the insertion of the song in the play nor the change in the chorus .

		In '' The Talking Oak , ''
Tennyson	PERSON	made only two changes after its first publication in
1842	DATE	.

		Shepherd -LRB- '' Tennysoniana , '' 2d ed ,
1879	DATE	-RRB- says there was only one , and
Collins	PERSON	gives only one .

		It is amazing that he should have overlooked the second -LRB- line 215 -RRB- : `` The murmurs of the drum and fife '' for '' The whispers of the drum and fife . ''

		It is given in my '' Select Poems '' -LRB- p. 232 -RRB- .

		I think that nobody else has called attention to it .

		I first detected it in
1884	DATE	in the American edition of
1842	DATE	.

		As I bad not seen the English edition of
1842	DATE	, it occurred to me when I did not find it in
Collins	PERSON	's book that it might be only in the American edition , which was printed from advance sheets of the English ; but Professor
Jack	PERSON	informs me that it is in the latter .

		I could hardly believe that two collators overlooked it , but it seems that they did .

		The reader may be surprised that I should suspect a variation of this kind in an American edition printed from advance sheets ; but I had previously detected a curious one -LRB- unknown to all the critics -RRB- in the '' Idylls of the King . ''

		In `` Merlin and Vivien '' -LRB- entitled simply `` Vivien '' at first -RRB- , the American edition of
1859	DATE	reads -LRB- lines 148 fol . -RRB-

		: '' She loathed the knights and ever seem 'd to hear Their laughing comment when her name was named .

		For once , when
Arthur	PERSON	walking all alone , Vexed at a rumor rife about the Queen , Had met her , '' etc. .

		This reading is found nowhere else .

		The poet must have altered the passage before the English edition of
1859	DATE	was printed , but after the advance sheets had been dispatched to this country .

		The reading in
1857	DATE	, when '' six trial-copies '' of '' Enid '' and ''
Vivien	PERSON	'' were printed -LRB- of which the copy in the British Museum is believed to be the sole survivor -RRB- , was this : '' She hated all the knights because she deem 'd They wink 'd and jested when her name was named . ''

		The present reading is : `` She hated all the knights , and heard in thought Their lavish comment when her name was named .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 For once , - when
Arthur	PERSON	walking all alone , Vezt at a rumor issued from herself Of some corruption crept among his knights , Had met her , '' etc. .

		I have given only a few specimens of the more serious of Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's errors and omissions .

		I have found many others in the hasty examination I have made of perhaps a fifth part of the book .

		Misprints are not uncommon : as '' Confutzer '' for '' Confutzee '' in a suppressed stanza of '' The Palace of Art '' -LRB- p. 93 -RRB- ; `` books '' for `` book '' in an
1832	DATE	reading of a line in '' The
Miller	PERSON	's Daughter '' -LRB- p. 63 -RRB- `` The letters of the books she reads '' unless my note in the '' Select Poems '' -LRB- p. 198 -RRB- is wrong , which I do not believe ; the misplacing of a reference to a foot-note on p. 100 , which makes the
1832	DATE	reading of '' Where I may mourn and pray '' to be '' Dying the death I die '' -LRB- which should refer to '' And save me lest I die '' in the proceeding stanza -RRB- , etc. .

		I agree fully with Professor
Jack	PERSON	in regard to the foolishness of noting insignificant variations in spelling , like though and tho \ gray and grey , etc. .

		While giving these quite uniformly , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is very irregular in regard to
Tennyson	LOCATION	's whimsical omission of the hyphen in hundreds of compound words .

		Thus we find '' silkensailed , '' '' pearlgarland , '' '' darklatticed , '' '' sharpshadowed , '' '' chestnutboughs , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	prints many of these as
Tennyson	LOCATION	does ; others he prints with the hyphen ; others as two separate words ; and all three forms he often has in the same poem , and sometimes on the same page .

		In my editions I follow
Tennyson	PERSON	's eccentric method in all cases ; but I should not quarrel with anybody who chose to conform to or - dinary usage instead , if he would do it uniformly .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	is also irregular in regard to the punc - tuation of his quotations from the early editions ; but some of the variations -LRB- periods in place of commas and the like , which confuse or pervert the sense of the passage -RRB- are probably the fault of the proofreader .

		With all its defects the book is a valuable one .

		The labor involved in preparing it can hardly be appreciated except by the few who have tried their own hands at similar tasks .

		In the case of
Tennyson	PERSON	, who probably '' tinkered '' his poems more than any other English or American author , it is not likely that we shall ever have a perfectly complete and accurate variorum edition .

		He never brought out a new edition without some changes in the text perhaps a single little word in a line that had been unaltered for forty years or more , and one must carefully scrutinize every line and every word in each of many editions in order to detect these occasional trivial changes ; and after all he may over - look some of them , as I find from Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's book that I have done in two or three instances in poems that I have collated again and again .

		I have sometimes come very near making other mistakes .

		To give a single instance ,
Tennyson	PERSON	made no change in `` The Poet 's Song , '' published in
1842	DATE	, until forty-seven years later -LRB-
1889	DATE	-RRB- , when he put `` fly '' instead of `` bee '' in the line '' The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee . ''

		I had printed it in
1886	DATE	in a little book that I have not mentioned above -LRB- `` The Young People 's Tennyson '' -RRB- , and it was by the merest chance that , in adding it to the enlarged '' Select Poems '' in
1895	DATE	, 1 happened to refer to an English edition of that year and caught that '' fly . ''

		If I had not known the poem by heart I might have missed the insect even then .

		THE IRON CHANCELLOR IN A NEW LIGHT .

		* It is complained that if publishers go on feeding the current popular craving for sweets in the form of love-letters it will end in the public 's losing its taste for plain food altogether , and having its digestion permanently spoiled .

		There may be something in this , but the danger seems overdrawn .

		Reading , say ,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's love-letters through at a sitting would certainly be like eating one 's way unassisted through a whole box of caramels the results might be unpleasant .

		But it is not so of the Love Let - ters of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, which we have now before us in a comely volume of 430 pages .

		These quite German examples of the billet-doux are sensible , practical , '' newsy , '' only moderately saccharine .

		They are indited to
Fraiilein von Puttkamer	PERSON	a name not savoring particularly of sentiment .

		We do not mean that the letters are not affectionate , that they contain no tender passages , no terms of endearment .

		The Chan - cellor '' makes love '' throughout the earlier epistles at least , if in a rather rough ,
Junkerish	LOCATION	, half - cynical way .

		Once , in a burst of unusual tenderness , he calls Frl .

		von Puttkamer '' a little pink angel , '' but as he soon goes on to talk of a package of sausages and some socks she has sent him , the reader 's nerves are re - lieved .

		In fine , if the affection breathed from the letters is not of the ecstatic order , it is at all events a manifestly strong and durable fabric , made in
Germany	LOCATION	, and warranted to wear .

		The letters extend from the time -LRB-
1846	DATE	-RRB- of the writer 's engagement to Frl .

		von
Puttkamer	PERSON	, to
1889	DATE	; and about a third of them were writ - ten before the marriage took place .

		A few extracts will serve to show their general drift and quality .

		A letter of
1850	DATE	indicates the writer 's opinion of the liberal movement of the time .

		Speaking of the possibility of a clash between
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	,
Bismarck	PERSON	goes on to say : ''
Robert Blum	PERSON	's bust , draped with black and white sashes and cockades , is the emblem by which members of the
Berlin	LOCATION	militia , and democrats of all countries here , at
Frankfort	LOCATION	, and elsewhere , celebrate their fes - tivities and swear vengeance on monarchs ; to this has
Prussia	LOCATION	grown .

		It is for these people we shall be THE LOVE LETTERS OF BISMARCK : Being Letters to his Fiancee and Wife , 1846-1889 .

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, victorious , if we are victorious ; and every democrat will exhibit his wounds to the King as an unpaid bill , when , with his help , we have conquered .

		I can not restrain my tears when I reflect what has become of my pride , my joy , my fatherland , the faithful , brave , honest Prussian nation , intoxicated by the giddy cup which they call Prussian honor , in the leading-strings of a gang of Rhenish place-hunters and scoffing democrats . ''

		The following sketch -LRB- 1851 -RRB- of
Amschel Rothschild	PERSON	shows that the Chancellor was no poor hand at a portrait : '' ... I have picked the enclosed leaves for you in the garden of old
Amschel Rothschild	PERSON	, whom I like , because he is simply a haggling Jew , and does not pre - tend to be anything else , and , at the same time , a strictly orthodox Jew , who touches nothing at his din - ners , and eats only ' undefiled ' food . '

		Johann , dage vid you some bread for de deers , ' he said to his servant as he came out to show me his garden , in which there were some tame fallow deer . '

		Baron , dat blant costs me two thousand guilders , honor bride , two thousand guilders cash ; I vill let you have it for one thousand , or , if you vant it for nuddings , he shall bring id to your house .

		God knows I abbrejiate you highly ,
Baron	LOCATION	; you are a nize man , a brave man . '

		With that he is a little , thin , gray imp of a man , the patriarch of his tribe , but a poor man in his palace , childless , a widower , cheated by his servants , and ill-treated by aristocratic - ally Frenchified and Anglicized nephews and nieces , who will inherit his treasures without gratitude and without love . ''

		In
1852	DATE	Bismarck fought his famous duel with
Vincke	PERSON	, and his account of the affair does not greatly heighten one 's esteem for his char - acter .

		``
Vincke	PERSON	wished to defer the matter for forty-eight hours , which I granted .

		On the 25th , at 8
A. M.	PERSON	, we rode to
Tegel	LOCATION	; to a charming spot in the woods by the seashore ; it was beautiful weather , and the birds sang so gayly in the sunshine that , as we entered the wood , all sad thoughts left me ; only the thought of
Johanna	PERSON	I had to drive from me by force , so as not to be affected by it .

		With me as witnesses were
Arnim	PERSON	and
Eberhard Stolberg	PERSON	, and my brother as a very dejected spectator .

		With V. was Sauken , and Major
Vincke	PERSON	of the
First Chamber	ORGANIZATION	, as well as a Bodelschwingh as impartial wit - ness .

		The latter declared before the matter began that the challenge seemed to him to be , under the circum - stances , too stringent , and proposed that it should be modified to one shot apiece -LRB- four had been agreed upon -RRB- .

		Sauken , in V. 's name , was agreeable to this , and had word brought to me that the whole thing should be called off if I declared I was sorry for my remark .

		As I could not truthfully do this , we took our positions , fired at
Bodelschwingh	ORGANIZATION	's command , and both missed .

		God forgive the grave sin that I did not at once recog - nize His mercy , but I can not deny it : when I looked through the smoke and saw my adversary standing erect , a feeling of disappointment prevented me from participating in the general rejoicing , which caused Bodelschwingh to shed tears ; the modification of the challenge annoyed me , and I would gladly have con - tinued the combat .

		But as I was not the insulted party , I could say nothing ; it was all over , and all shook hands . ''

		The following passage from a letter of
1847	DATE	will answer better than the foregoing extracts to show the Chancellor in the guise of a lover : '' Why do you so lament your last letter ?

		I found nothing in it that was not dear to me , or could have been dearer .

		And , were it otherwise , where should you in future find a heart on which to disburden your own of that which oppresses it , if not with me ?

		... My dear , dear
Johanna	PERSON	, must I tell you once more that I love you ; sons phrase , that we ought to share with each other joy and suffering , I your suffering and you mine ; that we are not united for the sake of showing and sharing with each other only that which gives pleasure ; but that you may pour out your heart at all times to me and I to you , whatever it may contain ; that I must and will bear your sorrows , your thoughts , your naughti - nesses , if you have any , and love you as you are not as you ought to be or might be ?

		... Do not keep your gloomy thoughts for yourself while you look on me with cheerful brow and merry eyes , but share with me in word and look what you have in your heart , whether it be blessing or sorrow ... Look upon us as mutual father - confessors ; as more than that , since we , according to the Scripture , are to be ' one flesh . ' ''

		The letters contained in this volume are , in point of fact , for the most part letters written by
Bismarck	PERSON	to his wife .

		To entitle them , , therefore , collectively '' Love Letters '' is not wholly accurate , although perhaps a third of them belong fairly in that category .

		They are certainly better worth reading than if they all harped constantly on the same tender string .

		They are various in tone and matter .

		They bring us very near sometimes to the
Chancel	LOCATION	- lor 's secret opinions on topics whereon he was accustomed to be reticent .

		For the most part they show Bismarck in an unusually amiable light .

		He is the affectionate , domestic , prac - tical-minded , confidential lover and husband throughout .

		W.e see how thoroughly whole - some and pleasant his home relations must have been ; how , amid the distractions , respon - sibilities , triumphs of his public career , it wa & about his own hearthstone that his affections and deepest interests really centred .

		The biographical value of the letters is consider - able , and they certainly tend to soften the rugged lines of the usually accepted portrait of the Iron Chancellor .

		Clearly , the man of blood and iron , the cynical statesman who de - clared that the moral law had no bearing on politics , was a lovable man in the home circle .

		The volume is handsomely got up , and contains some interesting portraits after unfamiliar orig - inals .

		THE DIAL 331
THORPE	PERSON	'S CONSTITUTIONAL , HISTORY .

		* Professor
Thorpe	PERSON	's `` The Constitutional History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' is a record of the rise and progress of the American consti - tution , from a new point of view .

		While this work differs from all those on the subject which have preceded it , it does not aim to displace any of them , but constitutes a distinct addition to the group .

		Though the author extends his observations over the entire period of our nat - ional history down to
1895	DATE	, he is less discursive than
Von Hoist	PERSON	, whose work included an elab - orate presentation of our political affairs , such as are generally considered not a part of our constitutional history .

		Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	aims to elaborate such political movements only as were fundamental in their bearing .

		His treat - ment of his subject somewhat resembles that of
Curtis	PERSON	, but he covers a longer period , thus requiring more pages .

		The three volumes of his work are not unduly expanded .

		Indeed , in view of one consideration noted below , the treatise might well have been made larger .

		The present work serves either as a supple - ment , or as a companion treatise , to Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	's earlier '' Constitutional History of the American People . ''

		That work was intended as an exposition of the
State	ORGANIZATION	side , and the present one as an exposition of the
National	ORGANIZATION	side , of our dual system of government .

		Ref - erences are here frequently made to passages or chapters in the former treatise .

		Those who possess both works , or who find them together in the same library , can utilize them jointly by means of these references .

		But the two parts of our dual system are so far one , as the author 's present references to his earlier volumes indi - cate , that his readers could have no ground of objection to the size of the new treatise if it had been expanded to five volumes , by em - bodying in 1 it all the matter which was included in his first '' Constitutional History . ''

		The two elements of this dual system may well be considered together as parts of one whole ; and there are certain advantages to be gained by this mode of studying them which are not se - cured when these elements are examined separ - ately .

		As Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	said in his earlier work : '' Originally as well as lawfully , the common - wealth constitutions are a part of the national . ''

		The plan of construction adopted for this treatise by Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	is advantageous , and is * THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES , 1765-1895 .

		well adapted for the presentation of those de - tails which he has assumed to be of prime importance .

		To treat with fidelity all the minutiae of so vast a general theme , or to give even slight attention to every detail for which any one of a thousand readers might perhaps be expected to make a demand , would be ob - viously impracticable .

		Some limits must be set to the size of the work , and only those de - tails which are of more general interest can be allowed discussion in the text .

		A happy com - promise between vague generalization and in - terminable minuteness has been adopted .

		The period of time from
1765	DATE	to
1895	DATE	has been divided into six epochs , of varying length , to each of which is devoted a section of the treatise , called a '' Book . ''

		The transition of thirteen detached colonies into one national
State	ORGANIZATION	, during the years from
1765	DATE	to
1787	DATE	, is presented in Book I. , under the title of '' The New Nation . ''

		Book II. , devoted to `` The Formation of the National Constitution , '' re - lates the preparations for and the drafting and submission of that instrument .

		Its reception by the people , and their adoption of it with its early amendments , including the twelfth in
1804	DATE	, occupy the space allotted to Book III. , with the heading , '' The Constitution before the People . ''

		Then follows the period of '' Con - test and Compromise , '' from
1804	DATE	to
1861	DATE	, in Book IV. , wherein is traced the path of con - troversy over the compromises of the Consti - tution concerning slavery , down to the time when swords took up the quarrel .

		Book V. presents the four years of the Civil War , under the name of '' Emancipation , '' the word which sums up the great change effected by that war in our governmental system . ''

		The Extension of the Suffrage '' is the theme of Book VI. , describing the next great change in that system , which was adopted as a logical development from the immediate results of the war .

		Thus is attained an easy analysis , into periods of varying duration , of our entire constitutional progress as a Nation , down to the advent of the present entirely new era .

		The mode of treatment chosen by Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	, for the presentation of the constitu - tional features of each of these epochs , is to illustrate them by drawing largely upon the current debates and discussions , and expres - sions of individual and aggregate opinion , in legislatures , conventions , and other public as - semblies .

		The controversies of the time , repro - duced in condensed form , speak for themselves , in the arguments advanced , the clashing of 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, contrary views , the statutes or resolutions adopted , and the constitutional amendments presented and considered .

		Those who have read with pleasure the pages of Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	's earlier work will find here the same vivid and picturesque presentation of the living issues of each of these epochs in our history .

		It is most interesting reading to trace , in practically the language of the time itself , the course of de - bate , not only upon the framing by the conven - tion and the discussion by the people of the original Constitution , but also upon the consid - eration of the early amendments ; of the com - promise legislation , prior to the Civil War , respecting slavery ; of the unsuccessful move - ments toward further compromises ; and finally , of the successive post-bellum amendments , each advancing to a constitutional outpost not pre - viously occupied .

		The movement of an epoch , a century old , is thus brought before us with the freshness of the present time , and the vital interests of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen - turies , in questions fundamental to our system of government , become vital to us to-day .

		One agreeable instance of Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	's method is in his paraphrase of the President 's arguments for nationality in
1861	DATE	.

		Lincoln stepped into his office with an authoritative and categorical statement of the constitutional rights and powers of the central government , and the utter unconstitutionality of secession , which were to be the basis upon which his adminis - tration would wage a defensive war for the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	as its prime object .

		Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	wisely adopts the ideas advanced by
Lincoln	LOCATION	, in this and his later state papers , and the language in which they were presented , as the best exposition in our literature of the nationality which underlies our Constitution .

		His argument was clear and vigorous , befitting his high theme ; and his presentation of the national idea was then , and still remains , un - answerable .

		Graphic is our author 's picture of the insti - tution of slavery entrenched in the compromises of the Constitution , the inertness of the national government , and the general torpidity of the public mind on the subject , as indicated in the projected thirteenth amendment of
1861	DATE	which was to perpetuate the institution .

		Graphic , too , is his representation of the change of pub - lic sentiment , even in the border States , and the movement toward State constitutions de - claring against slavery , when the progress of the war had proven the institution effete , and the adoption by the States of the doctrine of the paramount allegiance of citizens to the
National	ORGANIZATION	government .

		It is refreshing to observe that Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	finds no warrant , in the facts of our history , for the theory of the rightfulness of secession .

		The Declaration of Independence was a joint , not a several act . ''

		In practical politics it announced the birth of a new nation . ''

		Months before ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had advised the people that '' it would be very dangerous to the liberties and welfare of
America	LOCATION	for any colony separately to petition the King or either
House	ORGANIZATION	of Par - liament . ''

		The
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, in
1775	DATE	, had declined to declare in favor of independence , leaving '' a so general and momentous concern to the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gress . ''

		The recommendation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, that she take steps toward a provincial government in that colony , until the
King	PERSON	's governor should consent to govern the colony according to its charter , '' proves the truth of the saying of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is not only older than the Constitution , but older than the States . ''

		The mere fact that in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	each colony was allowed one vote '' can not in justice be made the basis for the later claims of the ad - vocates of State sovereignty . ''

		Though it may seem ungracious to question , in any respect , so excellent a treatise , it must be confessed that this work is in one way dis - appointing .

		The author seems inclined to treat with less than justice the efforts of the colonial Fathers in resisting the British aggressions .

		Their opposition to the Parliamentary claim of right to tax the colonies is clearly stated , but is pronounced groundless . ''

		The right , though successfully questioned by the Americans , seems now , when we may calmly reflect over it , to be well founded in the principles of government . '' ''

		The best argument against parliamentary taxation must be economic rather than legal , and must proceed from a revolutionary interpretation of government . '' ''

		They denied the supreme power of Parliament to tax
America	LOCATION	, though without good authority for the denial . '' ''

		Thus the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	attempted to put the British government in the wrong . ''

		So it was that '' Acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, strictly legal and constitutional , became the ostensible excuse for American Independence . ''

		These impeachments of the legal ability of the colonial bar are coupled with two significant admissions : the accused were diligent students of the Constitution , and they were honest in their convictions . ''

		The Americans were thoroughly convinced of the truth and justice of their own interpretation of consti -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 tutional principles , -LSB- and -RSB- it is not unjust to say that , at this time , the idea of constitutional government was more clearly recognized in
America	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet he compares these colonials with those who in
1861	DATE	proposed to sever the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and says that , with the beginning of the Revolu - tion , `` nullification was rapidly becoming seces - sion . ''

		These are our author 's generalizations , without either explanation in argument or citations of authority .

		The constitutional argu - ments of
John Dickinson	PERSON	against the
Parlia	LOCATION	- mentary power of taxation over the colonies , and of
John Adams	PERSON	and
James Wilson	PERSON	against the existence of any legislative power of Par - liament whatever over the colonies , in
1774	DATE	, were based on numerous early British prece - dents .

		If these arguments are to be condemned by the impartial historian as groundless , they should be shown to be either inherently weak , or overweighted by sound adverse arguments .

		There are other generalizations in our au - thor 's work which seem to be hastily made .

		It is said of the introduction by
Randolph	PERSON	into the Federal convention in
1787	DATE	, of the
Virginia	LOCATION	plan , contemplating a national government , consisting of a supreme legislative , executive , and judiciary , that '' this was the first use of the term national , in the sense in which it is now commonly understood . ''

		If it be desirable to fix the earliest use of this term , further in - vestigation may be needed .

		Aside from its use by individuals , as by
Washington	LOCATION	and
Paine	PERSON	, in
1783	DATE	, it is found in the Report of the
Committee of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, drawn by
Madison	PERSON	, under date of
September 25 , 1783	DATE	, on the me - morial from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	respecting the grant of half-pay to the officers of the army , wherein that measure is referred to as '' an act finally adopted , and the national faith pledged to carry it into effect . ''

		Again , it is said : '' It is difficult to fix the exact time or occasion when the word Nation was first employed to describe the government of the American people , but there is reason to believe that one of the first uses of the word in this sense was made by President
Lincoln	PERSON	in his
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , in which he spoke of the Government of the People as that of ' a new Nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . ' ''

		To take this view , we must forget that in
1793	DATE	Judge
Wilson	PERSON	of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	found it easy to answer affirmatively the ques - tion , '' Do the people of the
United States	LOCATION	form a Nation '' -LRB- and this with a big N -RRB- ; and that in his answer he said : '' The people of the
United States	LOCATION	intended to form themselves into a nation for national purposes .

		They instituted , for such purposes , a national government complete in all its parts , with powers legislative , ex - ecutive , and judiciary , and in all these powers extend - ing over the whole nation . ''

		It is with regret that the reviewer has found occasion to qualify , by these discriminations , his commendation of a work so well conceived , and , in most respects , so admirably accom - plished .

		A JOURNEY TO NATURE .

		* About six months ago , a series of papers appearing weekly in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' attracted our attention .

		They were written in a style that was noteworthy even among the excellent literary papers that one habitually finds in that journal , and as the chapters went on from week to week , we found ourselves eagerly awaiting the
Saturday	DATE	issue of the '' Post '' in which a continuation of the series might be expected .

		Presently they came to an end , but we were confident of their res - urrection in a book , so clearly deserving they were of the more substantial form of publica - tion .

		The confidence was justified , and the entire series is now reproduced under the title '' A Journey to Nature , '' while in place of the mysterious initials `` J. P. M. '' -LRB- which sug - gested to us nothing but the name of Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	-RRB- , we find upon the title-page the name of Mr.
J. P. Mowbray	PERSON	.

		The book is remarkable in more ways than one , and is sure to attract much attention .

		Its humor , its philosophy , its pungency of style , and its wholesome view of life are qualities that go to the making of literature rather than of journalism , and more than once , while reading the several chapters in their original form , we felt that we were enjoying some such rare ex - perience as was enjoyed by the fortunate dis - coverers of '' My Summer in a Garden '' in the columns of the
Hartford	LOCATION	'' Courant , '' or even of the '' Essays of Elia '' in the pages of the ''
London	LOCATION	Magazine . ''

		Now re-reading the papers in their collective form , our early im - pression is deepened , although we are conscious of an occasional reservation of praise of the sort that almost necessarily results when the mental attitude is shifted from that of a skimmer of newspapers to that of a reader of books .

		But these reservations are very slight indeed , affect - ing only a word or a phrase here and there , and more than adequate compensation is offered for * A JOURNEY TO NATURE .

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, a few trifling defects in the sense of continuity and artistic unity that we get when the book is taken at a single reading .

		In a way , the book is a story-book , although the whole of its story may be told in a few words .

		Briefly , it deals with the experiences of a Wall Street stock-broker , plunged in the thick of business and social life , and suddenly confronted with the vision of sudden death .

		An attack of heart failure pulls him up short , and hurries him into the country for a cure .

		He is a man in the forties , a widower , with one small boy ,
Charlie	PERSON	, whom he takes along .

		The place of refuge provided is a cabin , an appanage of a decayed manorial homestead , somewhere in
Central New York	LOCATION	.

		In this cabin the man and the child and a yellow dog set up a primitive form of housekeeping , being cared for in the grosser ways by
Gabe Hotch	PERSON	- kiss , the farmer who occupies the homestead , and ministered unto in somewhat more delicate fashion by his niece
Griselle	PERSON	.

		These are the dramatis personce of the story , these , and the Doctor , who , delighted to have found a patient who will take his advice , comes out now and then to see how things are getting along .

		The book is made up of communings with nature , the natural incidents of vaga - bond life , occasional dialogue , and
Griselle	PERSON	.

		This young woman seems to be merely a lay figure in the earlier chapters , but her person - ality is gradually insinuated into the substance of the story , until she more than shares the interest with the narrator himself .

		The author 's management of this charming person is the most artistic feature of his work .

		Casual ob - servation , curiosity , sympathetic attention , sentimental interest , affection , love , and chas - tened disappointment , these are the successive notes in the gamut of the relationship between the man and the maiden .

		It is a familiar se - quence , but one not often presented with such delicacy and charm .

		But quite enough has been written about and around this book ; let us turn to the more convincing task of illustration .

		The exile has arrived at his cabin , and has set his teeth in grim determination to '' stick it out . '' ''

		This was the bravado of the will , and even while it was flourishing I was .

		conscious that I would give the hovel and the two big boxes that had been set down at its door for a cocktail . ''

		I asked the two men who had driven us and the boxes up where I could get some ice and a lemon .

		They looked at each other as if I had asked them for a French menu . '

		Ice ? '

		said one of them . '

		You might git some at the butcher 's in
Spelldown	LOCATION	.

		It 's four miles and a half .

		There 's a
spring	DATE	in the medder yonder , but the lemon crop ai n't very good this year . ' ''

		That 's so , ' said his companion , wiping his face with his shirt-sleeves , ' the potato bugs hurt the young lemons awfully last season . ' ''

		The Doctor comes up for a few days of rough life , and is highly pleased with his patient 's condition , until a chance remark awakens dark suspicion . '' '

		You 're convalescent that 's all .

		You must keep this jig up for one year .

		I do not propose to let up on my prescription , if you expect me to carry you through to a good old age .

		You see , I 've got a good deal at stake in this matter .

		You 've been a pretty good boy so far .

		I did not believe you could do it .

		In fact , you 're the first man I ever met who could give up female society entirely and take to the woods on sani - tary principles , and you will make a shining example when you go back to Broadway and Wall Street . ' ''

		At that moment
Charlie	PERSON	came to the door and shouted , Say , Dad , where do you suppose
Griselle	PERSON	keeps the pepper and salt ? ' ''

		I remember that the Doctor , who looked very ab - surd in his bare feet , came over and stood in front of me , and said with as cavernous an intonation as he could command , ' Who in thunder is Griselle ? ' ''

		One night the invalid drinks coffee recklessly , has a nightmare , wakes up with violent heart - throbs , and loses his nerve completely .

		Think - ing of nothing else to do , he proposes to the yellow dog that they have a wood fire . ''

		I might as well put down that dog 's reply , if for no other reason than that it is a true dog 's reply , and not man 's , which dog talk is so apt to be .

		This is what he said , exactly : ' I ca n't make out what it is that you propose to do , but I understand in a general way that you are going to do something , and I 'm with you whatever it is .

		Let 's make as much hullabaloo about it as we can . ' ''

		I have learned that a dog apprehends a man 's mean - ing very much as a man apprehends the meaning of a symphony .

		It is purely a matter of tones and not of articulations .

		He seizes upon your moods , not upon your ideas , with the marvellous generalizing capacity of a sympathetic ear .

		He responds to the allegros and andantes , appropriates the rhythms without conscious - ness , and keeps time to the feelings as they slip and merge .

		Man must be a continual Beethoven to a dog , uttering mystic strophes that he can not analyze .

		A dog is thus superior to a man in that he is always saved from being a critic . ''

		One more passage may be given , illustrative of the graver moods of the book , and showing how well Nature did her work , no less for the soul than for the physical frame of her patient .

		It takes the form of a soliloquy . ''

		I feel confident that a healthy adjustment of facul - ties , and the suspension of an agressive egotism , put a man en rapport with new harmonies that he never be - fore suspected .

		If he walk in the cordial but silent woods , he finds that the defiance goes out of his verte - brae , and he is acquiring the bowed head ; and if we look narrowly here we shall find , I think , that the bowed head of the savant and the saint are the tokens of a similar but unequal humility .

		These conclusions bore into one 's old timbers unobserved like the teredo ,
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 when one lives apart from his fellows for a while ; so that I grew to think , like the Doctor , that it was good for every man to have hermit hours , and to keep a wil - derness somewhere into which he can escape from him - self .

		In such sequestered moments tides of soft intimations come from afar , and there are apt to be astral banners fluttering in one 's outreach whisper - ings of origins and outcomes , never before heard in the soft procession of the universes ; faint , kindly voices reaching up from the lowliest processes , trying to speak of kinship and fatherhood .

		There are new and tiny links far down the inscrutable depths , and they glitter in the gloom with threads of promise , forever weaving the continuity and indestructibility of life ift a majestic synthesis . ''

		On the walls of the Doctor 's city office , we are told , there was a Scriptural motto , '' For thus saith the Lord God , the Holy One of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		In returning and in rest ye shall be saved .

		In quietness and confidence shall be your strength , and ye would not . ''

		It is the lesson of this passage that `` A Journey to Na - ture '' inculcates , and the lesson is one that we Americans , more than most other people , need to learn .

		The book is an evangel of the quiet life , the life freed from the unnecessary per - plexities of man 's own making , the true life of the spirit for which so many of us vainly strive .

		It is a beautiful book , and we count it a privi - lege to have had this opportunity of saying even these few inadequate words in its praise .

		OUR CONTEMPORARY STAGE .

		* Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	's volume , '' The Stage in
America	LOCATION	, 1897-1900 , '' treats those aspects of the acted drama which have played the most important part in American theatrical history during the past few years , besides pre - senting a purely critical consideration of the histrionic notabilities connected therewith .

		The purpose of the book so far as any chief purpose can be discovered in the work of one who is so emphatically a critic of detail seems to be to rescue from unmerited oblivion records of those productions worthy of a more enduring place than that which is given in the daily newspaper .

		Says the author : `` So many influences enter into the formation of a dramatic opinion , or even into a mere narration of theatrical incident , that to select among the facts , im - pressions , and beliefs of four years those which sum up the period is full of peril .

		After reversing my view of
Henry Esmond	PERSON	's ability in comedy , or of the degree of Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	's talent , what shall I think of my next con - viction ?

		The difficulty is not new : even
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	has * THE STAGE IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	, 1897-1900 .

Norman Hap	PERSON	- good .

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		written foolish things about Hamlet ; the sharp differ - ence between him and
Schiller	PERSON	over
Egmont	LOCATION	was on a subject where both were masters ; the meanderings of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	's ' What la Art ? '

		are matched by aberrations of
Hume	PERSON	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	, and
Dryden	PERSON	. ''

		As a corollary to this we may add that dra - matic criticism is one of the most difficult forms of criticism , for it has no written form - ula , no stereotyped standard , to fall back upon .

		It is man 's opinions based on man 's knowledge of preexisting and present conditions , on man 's accepted and preconceived conclusions as to what should constitute the ideal form of that particular branch of art under discussion , and of man 's understanding of the technique of the drama .

		The highest and brightest achieve - ment in dramatic criticism is reached when the critic remains true to his own convictions , albeit his ultimate conclusions may be at vari - ance with the world at large , for every thought of the true critic assimilates , respires , and en - larges in that sphere of art which he has chosen to study ; and in arguing with oneself one has always a respectful antagonist to whose objections every attention must be given .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	touches upon the problems of the stage in a manner which reveals a clear and comprehensive insight .

		In speaking of the theatrical trust -LRB- a product of one of the gloomy qualities of American life : the exces - sive love of wealth -RRB- he says : `` Its growth was rapid , its power immense , and the history of its rise , if intimately known , sounds like a melodrama or a satirical romance ... This syndicate can say to the theater owner : ` If yon do not do busi - ness with us on our own terms , we will not let you have first-rate attractions .

		If you do , we will destroy your rival , or force him to the same terms .

		For the book - ings we will take a share of the profits . '

		To the actor or traveling manager it can say : Yon must play in our theaters or in barns .

		For our theaters we make our own terms . '

		To both it can say : ' Nominally , we act as your agents .

		In reality , we are your absolute masters . ' ''

		These sentiments are voiced by the majority of our actors and critics .

		In his chapter on '' The Drama of Ideas , '' the author proves himself to be a diseur de boil-mots , as the following quotations , picked at random , will attest : '' It was a sadly demoralized man who said he had three rules for the conduct of life ; of which the first was , never to see the plays of
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, and the other two did not matter but it was an artist also and a critic who spoke . '' ''

		The kinship between intellectual innocence and real culture is what makes bad melodramas so good and good melodramas so bad . '' ''

		The greatest literary ideas are dramatic ideas ; most of the world 's highest literature is poetry , and most of its highest poetry is drama .

		We need not fear that 336 THE DIAL modern times are undramatic , for artistic genius is creative , and when it exists it will create somewhat in its universal manner . '' ''

		Great dramatic ideas are imaginative and emotional conceptions , and the nearest to an exact statement that can be made about them will tell what feeling of life they imbue . ''

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	tells us that there is a drama , not large but distinct , which belongs espe - cially to the
United States	LOCATION	of to-day , and , whether lasting or not , to contemporary ob - servers seems to move on more artistic princi - ples than any native plays of the past . ''

		Two men stand , as far as we can see , clearly ahead of their predecessors :
James A. Herne	PERSON	for intellectual qualities , supported by considerable stagecraft ;
William Gillette	PERSON	for the playwright 's talents , working on ideas of his own .

		Their plays are equaled by single efforts of other men , but no other American dramatist has done as much of equal merit . ''

		Speaking of American humor , he reminds us that a certain form of humor , not the high - est , and yet not unrelated to the larger kind , is found as incessantly in our farces and va - riety shows as in our presidential campaigns . ''

		Fatalism and buoyancy , love of exaggeration , and a taste for slang are some of the compon - ents . ''

		But he merely lessens the dignity of his arguments by inserting some very insipid quotations from broad farces and burlesques which , for some reason or other , draw intel - lectual audiences to a certain metropolitan music hall .

		Who was it that said human nature in
America	LOCATION	is somewhat like the articles in a great exhibition , where the largest and loudest things first catch the eye and usurp the attention ?

		Upwards of forty years ago ,
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	, speaking of the frivolous character of our plays , said : '' Unless a frank recognition of this inevitable tendency cause a decided separation of the drama which aims at art from those theatrical performances which only aim at amusement of a lower kind -LRB- just as classic music keeps aloof from all contact and all rivalry with comic songs and sentimental ballads -RRB- , and unless this separation takes place in a decisive restriction of one or more theatres to the special performance of comedy and the poetic drama , the final disappearance of the art is near at hand . ''

		This quotation is not inserted for the sake of calling attention to and praising the so-called `` palmy days '' of the stage , but merely as a preliminary remark in calling attention to the fact that , according to Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	, there is only one high-class theatre in
America	LOCATION	: the Irving Place Theatre , in
New York	LOCATION	, where the running of a theatre is looked upon more as an art than as a trade .

		But as all productions are here given in Ger - man , its clientelage is limited .

		It is impossible to do more than point out the general purpose of the book under consid - eration .

		The titles of the principal chapters give an idea of the numerous topics treated : '' Ibsen , '' '' Recent Shakespeare , '' '' Foreign Tragedy , '' `` Rostand , '' ''
Pinero	PERSON	,
Shaw	PERSON	, and Jones , '' '' From the French , '' '' Histrionic and Literary Side-shows , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	is '' nothing if not critical '' ; but whereas that expression , as applied by lago to himself , denoted a mind especially on the alert to discover weak points in everything , it means something essentially different as applied to the present critic .

		In fact , the author shows himself to be a kind of Benthamite in art .

		RECENT ENGLISH POLITICAL , PHILOSOPHY .

		* Our age forsooth is still in the throes of transition .

		We begin the twentieth century with a number of problems and questions per - taining to their solution which have by no means found even approximately satisfactory answers .

		New ideas and theories chase each other like clouds on the spiritual horizon .

		That they are but clouds is due largely to the lack of true philosophical training in those who at - tempt to advance them .

		It is sometimes even painful to witness the vagueness of issue com - pared with the ado with which the answer is sought .

		The blending of sociological with political and historical ideas , or rather the forcing of the two latter to conform to the still somewhat indefinite and artificial reasoning of sociology , is more of a confusion than an assist - ance to a reader .

		Against the sense of in - security thus produced , it is an antidote to turn back upon the path , and review with some * ENGLISH POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY from

		AN INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH POLITICS .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 friendly author the work of those serious think - ers of the past whose labor has largely con - tributed to raise the foundation on which the present edifice of social and political reasoning is erected , and whose efforts have largely proved true .

		Thus it is possible , by way of contrast , to bring into comparison two recent books whose difference in scope and treatment would scarcely suggest each other .

		In a way they may serve as fair examples of the philo - sophical and the unphilosophical attitude of many writers of to-day .

		Professor
Graham	PERSON	's '' English Political Philosophy from
Hobbes	LOCATION	to
Maine	LOCATION	'' is one of the serious contributions to the study of polit - ical theory which thoughtful people welcome .

		We recognize that there is nothing especially new and original in the author 's presentation of his thoughts about these writers .

		The book would have been very well named ''
Introduc	PERSON	- tion to the Study of , '' etc. .

		It strikes one largely as a course of lectures condensed for convenient purposes into book form , explana - tory , discursive , rather scholastic in tone and not very argumentative .

		The criticism applied to the theories of these authors is drawn from the later discoveries in the world of thought and from the burning problems of to-day which their ideas have not succeeded in solving , and it is no wonder that they crumble before so fierce a light .

		The treatment is not perfunc - tory nor shallow but earnest and painstaking , and therefore the book will doubtless become a considerable help and guide to the serious student .

		And to become such a guide is , as we understand it , the author 's special object .

		By bringing the six foremost English thinkers upon political theory within one frame , and discussing their relation to each other and to other philosophers , a continuity in the devel - opment of thought is presented which one otherwise does not easily meet with .

		Locke is usually studied from the point of view of ab - stract philosophy ,
Burke	PERSON	from the point of view of literary merit , and Mill in connection with Political Economy , whose chief light he is .

		The study of Hobbes we believe is almost obsolete , and
Bentham	PERSON	too is usually taken up only incidentally , since the memory of these first explorers in the realm of
Political Science	ORGANIZATION	is obscured by the fame of their far more suc - cessful followers .

		Professor
Graham	PERSON	finds both Hobbes and
Bentham	PERSON	-LRB- and
Burke	PERSON	, too , for all that -RRB- lacking in penetration of thought and grasp upon actuality , but in his appreciation of their fundamental value he is both sincere and just .

		With
Burke	PERSON	it seems difficult for him to distribute the sun and shade of valua - tion properly .

		Burke 's greatest , and in our opinion his only , fault was his lack of under - standing of such a tremendous departure from the slow beaten track of social progress as the French Revolution .

		Burke was of course wrong in this ; yet he was the only statesman in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope who said anything against it which was neither puerile in tone nor bigoted in idea , which , on the contrary , has been generally pro- ductive of good to this day .

		It is indeed strange that as an Irishman , to rebellion bred , he should so misconstrue everything done on the other side of the Channel ; although if it had been for the immediate deliverance of his own race , he might have sanctioned much .

		If
Burke	PERSON	had not been ground so steadily and thoroughly in the English Parliamentary flour mill , he might have looked at matters differ - ently , and he , the English subject , not been outdone in liberal sympathies by the nobleman of hard feudal stock , the Prussian Count
Schla	PERSON	- brendorf , who hastened to
France	LOCATION	in anticipa - tion of the new star of liberty to be born there , and lived through most of the Jacobin sessions of stormy memory .

		But when will Celt ever understand Celt ?

		Bentham , as a political theorist , will claim more of the interest of our readers than
Burke	PERSON	, largely because
America	LOCATION	is the country where his doctrine of the greatest happiness for the greatest number has been more generally ad - hered to and realized .

		Yet his prophetic words in the defence of security , even if it be at the expense of equality -LRB- p. 223 -RRB- , may well resound in the minds of many who watch the gradual change from an individually independent to a semi-feudal relation which the lower social lay - ers are fast undergoing , conditions which have come '' for to stay '' and will not be discussed away .

		We quote his words : '' When security and equality are in conflict it will not do to hesitate for a moment .

		Equality must yield .

		The first is the foundation of life ; subsistence , abundance , happiness , everything depends upon it .

		Equality produces only a certain portion of good .

		Besides , whatever we may do , it will never be perfect ; it may exist a day ; but the revolutions of the morrow will overturn it .

		The establishment of a perfect equality is a chimera ; all we can do is to diminish inequal - ity . ''

		Still more interesting is
Bentham	PERSON	's de - mand that the laws be codified and made accessible in form and content to everybody .

		As Professor
Graham	PERSON	expresses his wish : 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, '' If now the laws which concern everybody were in one volume , and those which concerned only classes were in small separate volumes , if the general code had become , as with the Hebrews , a part of worship and a manual of education ; if a knowledge of it were required as a condition of the franchise , the law would then be truly known , every citizen would become its guardian , its violation would not be a mystery , its explanation would not be a monopoly , and fraud and chicane would no longer be able to elude it '' -LRB- p. 231 -RRB- .

		We believe it would have given the venerable philosopher a genuine delight if he could have beheld as perhaps through celestial omnis - cience he has the late publication of the Civil Code of the German Empire , printed for everybody 's use in a small volume which can be held in the hollow of one 's hand , yet read with perfect ease and costing but a mark .

		But we shall have to wait long before such a boon is given to this lawyer and judge ridden community .

		Speaking of
Bentham	PERSON	's impossible Love of Humanity , Professor
Graham	PERSON	says with a touch of some pertness : '' As far as the love of humanity ' is concerned , it is not here necessary to inquire how far it is possible to have any definite feeling for a vast entity like humanity , the best and noblest part of which is dead and passed away , while some part is not yet born , and much of what is alive and concrete may affect us in a manner that arouses anything but love .

		To form the conception of such is difficult , to have any real feeling for the com - posite object of it , is difficult .

		But it is perhaps psycho - logically possible to have a kind of love for the vast Being -LRB- much of which is not in being -RRB- through its best representatives , who are chiefly and necessarily the mighty dead , whose character and works are beyond dispute '' -LRB- p. 199 -RRB- .

		How will that do in
America	LOCATION	where Shake - speares and
Michel Angelos	PERSON	of to-day , if we trust the local reporter , are neither few nor far between , and admirable characters , accord - ing to Bostonian terminology , are not rare , but in fact crowding the public theatre so that there is hardly standing room ?

		We warn the pessimists of Professor
Graham	PERSON	's type off the planks , for they will surely be hooted at !

		And after all , is love of humanity as a distinct part of one 's make-up such an impossibility ?

		It is all very well , as Professor
Graham	PERSON	suggests , to do the best we can for ourselves and those who depend upon us , and let the matter rest there , but there is such a thing as generous sympathy with outsiders just because it is a beautiful thing to be friendly and '' God loveth a glad giver . ''

		This feeling of genuine warmth and good will toward all till they themselves repel us a feeling which makes one beloved by his fellow beings , and lifts the meeting of strangers into a charming experience , we look upon as not at all an impossibility .

		True , in spite of our philanthropy and altruism , this precious feeling as a gift , a disposition , seems to have faded out of our too practical lives and is now preserved in the original force only by a few simpletons .

		This feeling , it appears , is the real love of humanity ; which evidently
Bentham	PERSON	did not invent , but which he had pigeonholed properly in his theoretical mind and was going to advocate as worth striving for .

		If , in fact , the genuine article were dis - tributed more widely , and were less spoiled by the influence of some '' cause '' or other urging the individual to act in a stereotyped way , it would bring the gentle tact that prevents fric - tion , and the losses and crosses of life would be not left to specialists , as Professor
Graham	PERSON	suggests -LRB- p. 198 -RRB- , but be borne by everybody ; and we boldly state that if love of humanity becomes a cumbrance rather than a help , that is because true goodness is largely lacking .

		But we will leave this difficult subject , and make our only general criticism of Professor
Graham	PERSON	's mode of discussion .

		He is some - times so given over to common sense that he becomes rather trite .

		But this and the frequent repetitions are faults easily committed in books of this kind where clearness and simplicity are necessary characteristics .

		Mr.
John M. Robertson	PERSON	's book , '' An Intro - duction to English Politics , '' will presumably cause a good deal of controversy between the adherents of the old and the new school of his - torical writing .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is rather a rabid modernist ; the historical writers of many nations pass in review before him , are all weighed , and found wanting .

		What is it , then , that Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	himself must supply , since it is nowhere else to be found ?

		Briefly stated , it appears to be the presentation of some all - important phases of a nation 's life explained primarily by sociological causes , with the pur - pose not only of furthering a new doctrine , but also with the noble intention of thus teaching the nations of to-day , particularly those of English speech , to avoid mistakes already com - mitted and occasionally repeated .

		No one can feel anything but sympathy with such an at - tempt .

		The question is whether Mr.
Robert	PERSON	- son is successful in proving his point , and whether the method employed speaks in his favor as an independent and at the same time profound thinker .

		But Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	himself disclaims any thoroughness , which of course is for him the saving clause .

		The book consists of five parts , the first treating of political evolution , particularly
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 among the Romans and Greeks ; the second concerned with economic forces among these and also among the Byzantines .

		Part Three discusses the culture-progress in antiquity ; Part Four the Italian Republics .

		Part Five deals with the fortune of the lesser European states .

		In fact , the book covers a vast field , and presents matters in themselves exceedingly difficult to handle .

		Nor are they rendered easier by the fact that the author depends evi - dently , if not confessedly , on second hand in - vestigation .

		His views are those acquired mainly by the reading of other authors , and his book is largely a discussion of their views .

		Although the author says both good and true things , his pages contain less of what is indi - vidually the result of his labors than a constant polemic against the faulty opinions of other writers .

		It is sometimes amusing , sometimes exasperating , to find this incessant warfare .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's own points often have very little weight ; he applies his theory loosely or substitutes merely new words for other words , a new theory for an old , for , e. g. , the seven points in Paragraph Four of Chapter II. , Part I. , which give very little help to anybody in finding a new solution for the old question why
Rome	LOCATION	was thus and not otherwise .

		Besides , by virtue of the uncertainty of the remote past , any statement , however vague and inad - equate , can summon imaginary proof and as - sume the aspect of truth ; but to establish this truth beyond dispute is the difficult thing , and therein most writers fall short , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, be it said , not less than any other .

		* Part Two of the book -LRB- to which we can de - vote but scant attention -RRB- is by all means the best .

		Here as elsewhere the author employs the racy disjointed style of a notebook rather than the dull logical reasoning of a thesis .

		The common use of the words '' faculty '' and '' in - nate genius '' may indeed be unscientific , but Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's ridicule of them and insistence only on outside causes quite overlooks the fact that there is also something in the mind of a nation that moulds its fate .

		If perchance faculty means nothing more than the capacity to take advantage of opportunities , there is no denying that some nations , taken as a whole , possess this faculty very much as some indi - viduals do .

		If , therefore , in Part One Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	explains the constitutionalism of * One may be permitted to think of Professor
Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	's amused smile , if his eye should meet Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ertson 's verdict upon his * ' strenuous superficiality . ''

		We may question whether all things considered the super - ficiality of our esteemed writer is even strenuous .

		Rome by general indifferent causes in which conscious striving had no share , it is not pos - sible to see that he has come nearer to solving the problem why constitutional life had so much more of a chance in
Rome	LOCATION	than else - where .

		In
Rome	LOCATION	political life had less inter - ference from outside , if that is what he means ; but even so the faculty for constitutionalism remains .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	says -LRB- Part One -RRB- justly enough that
Rome	LOCATION	was in for plunder and went on plundering , the mythical wolf which nourished her infant kings remaining , as it were , her symbol .

		This thought is further carried out in
Part Two	LOCATION	, where it is stated that military expansion was an economic need and that the perpetual despoilment of the provinces was the chief doctrine of Roman economic law .

		But did
Rome	LOCATION	give the prov - inces nothing in return ?

		What had they pos - sessed before , and what did they possess after , the incorporation in her vast body politic ?

		A nation conquering so vast a territory and or - ganizing it on a military scale , it is true teaches the world at least one of the chief prin - ciples of civilization , i. e. , subordination , dis - cipline .

		That
Rome	LOCATION	abused her power was a result of the limitations of that same system , lacking as it did any outlet in individual effort .

		But that
Rome	LOCATION	developed a system of law , a monument of its conception of subordination , speaks for its having an ideal of life which we now are unable properly to criticize and from whose faults we can after all profit very little , because the basis of our existence lies elsewhere .

		Certain phases which can serve as illustrations of his theory Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	treats , others which demand more acute questioning , he lets lie .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is justly incensed against slavery , too , and sees the source of the economic decline of the Roman empire in this '' under - buying '' the labor of the free worker .

		No doubt ; but where lies the remedy for such sporadically returning change of social status ?

		Under certain conditions slavery appears as a lamentable necessity .

		If the signs far and near do not entirely mislead us , we are on the verge of such an age ourselves , when human life is too cheap to be maintained except by the severest drudgery .

		Life is after all nothing but a perpetual experiment with contingencies of which no generation can foresee the result ; one age tries one remedy , another tries a dif - ferent ; the outcome can never be permanent , and the rotation of layers in the course of time brings one at the top , while another sinks far below .

		In spite of certain defects , for which we can 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, prescribe no particular remedy , since they are inherent in the writer 's view , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's book will very likely create interest as a con - troversial contribution to the understanding of history .

		One thing is certain , the author is very much in earnest .

		His book is no doubt a well-meant effort and a most energetic one toward establishing new standards of practical value , especially toward awakening interest in the study of history as a source of political wisdom , of which many , both nations and in - dividuals , may be sadly in need .

AFRICA	LOCATION	.

		* It should hardly be necessary to point out that the prevailing fashion of historical fiction differs very little from its kindred fashion of contempo - raneous history in either intention or effect .

		In both the writer makes a study of the time and the occurrences within it , selecting the material which is most available for his purpose , straining it through his prepossessions and prejudices , and producing reading matter which is intended to be interesting and may or may not be accurate .

		If by any chance it comes out fair , impartial , and inclusive , the gods are to be thanked for unusual mercies ; if not , it will still compare quite favorably with all the other books in the world which make historical pretensions , from Herodotus , '' the Father of Lies , '' to Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, who could obtain no corrob - orative evidence for what he saw in a chance-medley beneath his window in the Tower .

		Mr.

		patriotism on both sides of the Channel , and leaving the critics and criticized equally impassioned and equally prone to special pleading .

		It would seem that some American , bound to
England	LOCATION	by the ties of a common language , common laws , and common aspirations , and bound to the doughty burghers by love for self-government , for independence , and for liberty of national action , should make the best and fairest historian of the war which is still waging on the South African veldt .

		When such a book comes , it will certainly be welcomed .

		But it is not before us yet .

		All these considerations become effective when such a work as the ''
London	LOCATION	Times '' has under - taken comes into the critic 's hands .

		In the first of its five large octavo volumes , edited by Mr.
L. S. Amery	PERSON	, a fellow of
All Souls College	ORGANIZATION	, there would seem to be room for the dispassionate presentation of both sides of the controversy within the 392 pages which carry the reader from the year
1815	DATE	, when the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	confirmed the British title to the
Cape	LOCATION	, to the beginning of actual hostili - ties , on
October 12 , 1900	DATE	.

		True , the ``
London	LOCATION	Times '' has been notoriously the organ of the ex - treme imperial faction of the Conservative party , and any editor it might select must represent its editorial policy ; yet the '' Times '' has borne a great reputation for accuracy and candor in days gone by , and it has published communications , if not despatches , in its columns which did not leave the Republics without some advocacy .

		The work clearly shows an endeavor to give everything which can elucidate the matters in dis - pute .

		It contains an extraordinary number of portraits in photogravure , and in these Briton and Boer are certainly represented with all impartiality .

		There is a map ; and there are appendices contain - ing a chronological table of events in South African history and many excerpts from official documents .

		But the place of honor , the frontispiece , is given the Rt. .

		Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	; the map assumes the incorporation of the two Republics into the British Empire as a fact accomplished ; and the conventions - which are contained in the appendices are not complete , and one , at least , of the omissions is injurious to the presentation of the burgher cause .

		In like manner the Editor 's Introductory follows his Preface in a confession of the failure of impartiality , and in acting along the lines of a policy announced in the following words : '' The present volume has been written frankly from the point of view of one who is convinced that the es - sential right and justice of the controversy have been with his own country , and that the policy which has been pursued by the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	has been , both politically and morally , justifiable .

		There is , no doubt , a Boer side to the controversy , a point of view based on the memory of old grievances , on peculiar social and political ideals , on a far-reaching national ambition .

		But it is a side which it is not easy for the ordinary reader to sympathize with , unless he can both appreciate and share the sentiments which have animated the burghers of the Republics in their hostility to the Im - perial
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		To that side the present account ,
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 in so far as it endeavors to give a true description of the Boer policy and of Boer aspirations , can do no real injustice .

		There is , however , another view with which the account given in this volume is entirely incompatible .

		That is the ' pseudo-Boer ' or ' pro- Boer ' view a view begotten mainly of ignorance as to the real character and aims of President
Kruger	PERSON	's policy .

		... It b a fictitious case . ''

		Perusal of the book will confirm this sufficiently candid declaration of its intent .

		It proceeds on the assumption that the Great Trek was an unau - thorized secession from British rule , though Sir
Henry Cloete	PERSON	, cited as an authority for that period , leaves quite a different impression .

		It pays no at - tention to the works of the Rt. .

		Hon.
James Bryce	PERSON	, though it does rely on '' Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's vari - ous writings / ' The chapter on the years following the
Jameson Raid	ORGANIZATION	is from an anonymous hand an extraordinary failure of authority for the most critical and momentous period discussed in the vol - ume .

		The chapter on the movement which led to Imperial intervention is from the hand of Mr.
W. F. Monypenny	PERSON	, at that time the editor of the '' Star , '' a subsidized organ of the mine-owners , and later the correspondent of the ''
London	LOCATION	Times '' itself .

		Colonel
Frank Rhodes	PERSON	is thanked for many valuable suggestions .

		Mr.
J. F. van Oordt	PERSON	, though styled by Mr.
Amery	PERSON	himself '' a fanatical partizan , '' is relied upon to furnish ample refutation of what I have called the ' pseudo-Boer ' case . ''

		Truly , the history is poisoned at its sources .

		The four remain - ing volumes will deal with hostilities in the field .

		Mr.
A. G. Hales	PERSON	, whose '' Campaign Pictures '' never lacks interest , is an Australian , the author of a well-received book of travel , and the special cor - respondent of the ''
London Daily News	ORGANIZATION	'' during a part of the war .

		Attached to the Australian con - tingent under
General Methuen	ORGANIZATION	, he was taken pris - oner by the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	at the battle of
Rensburg	LOCATION	, released and returned to the British lines as a non-combat - ant by President
Steyn	PERSON	after seeing much of the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	in field , hospital , and camp , and only recalled to
England	LOCATION	after the victory at
Thaba ` Nchu	ORGANIZATION	.

		His narrative is vivacious and , to a marked degree , im - partial .

		He bears willing testimony to the humanity and disinterested self-sacrifice of the burghers , and he does not consider himself in any way obligated to close his eyes to abuses on the British side .

		For that bloodthirstiest of all the English , the man who does all his fighting with his mouth , he has a few excoriating paragraphs , the close of one of them worth quoting , in view of what follows . ''

		The old British pioneer may have whelped a few million good fighting stock in his time , but this class of animal is no lion 's whelp ; it is a thing all month and no manners , a shallow-brained , cowardly creature , al - ways howling about the Boer , but too discreet to go out and fight him , though ready at all times to malign him , to ridicule him as a farmer or a fighter .

		And it is a perfect bear 's feast to this hybrid animal to get hold of a gullible newspaper correspondent to tell him gruesome tales relative to Boer fighting laagers . ''

		It must have been not one , but a dozen , of these cattle which undertook the education of Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	, whose book , '' An American with
Lord Roberts	PERSON	, '' is most misleadingly named .

		Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	was the special correspondent of the ''
London	LOCATION	Daily Mail , '' the British equivalent of those Amer - ican `` yellow journals '' which bragged about the little war with
Spain	LOCATION	as l - our war . ''

		Some allow - ance must doubtless be made for the policy of his paper , which would probably have rejected anything which did not seek the justification of
Great Britain	LOCATION	by unlimited abuse of the other side , but even with this made it is impossible to understand how Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	could style himself ' an American '' in any - thing but the purely technical sense of that much - abused word .

		He has no word of praise for any man who fought for the two Republics , and never a word of dispraise for those on the other side .

		It would not be difficult , if it were worth while , to pick absolutely contradictory statements out of the pages of Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	and Mr.
Hales	PERSON	, the former speaking on what he admits to be mere hearsay and the lat - ter from individual experience .

		Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	's book , interestingly written as it is , remains chiefly valu - able as showing in an American what many of us have always taken to be the characteristic of the Briton abroad a willingness to believe anything that can expand the pages of a book .

		We much prefer to regard as the work of an American '' in this most disastrous struggle be - tween Imperial
Britain	LOCATION	and the two Republics the efforts of Mr.
Bartlett-Burdett-Coutts	PERSON	as set forth in his pamphlet , '' The Sick and `` Wounded in
South Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Though a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, this American-born English gentleman went at his own expense to the scene of war and distress , and having seen with his own eyes the evidences of the break - ing down of the military medical system under the burden of too much red tape and officialism , re - turned to make known the results of his journey from his seat in the national legislature .

		What he saw is made clear in his book ; but it is no less evi - dent that he incurred the displeasure of that class of devotees who see in the most rational criticism of their fellow-countrymen the voicing of treason Mr.
Hales	PERSON	also incurred the same unreasoning slander .

		His account is therefore eked out with a re-statement of his position , made necessary by the misrepresentations of his enemies , indignant at his refusal , unlike Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	, to be the servile mouth - piece of those who would further destroy the pres - tige of the English name by as much indifference to human suffering as there had been indifference to the rights of a foreign and weaker people .

		The book has on its cover the apt quotation '' Lest we forget , '' a reminder to Americans that similar hor - rors in the Cuban campaign seem not to have bet - tered the attention given our soldiers in
China	LOCATION	, during the recent massacres and looting there .

May 16	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS . ''

		A
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of Canadian Verse '' An anthology -LRB- Button -RRB- , edited by Dr.
Theodore	PERSON	of Canadian song .

		V / ' , .11 iU i II .

		Rand , is an acceptable anthology of Canadian song .

		The editor himself is one of the veteran men of letters of his country , and has performed his task with skill and discrimination .

		One hundred and thirty-five writers are represented in all , and this number would have been greater by one were it not for the omission -LRB- through no edi - torial fault -RRB- of Mr.
William Wilfred Campbell	PERSON	.

		Those who have not kept close watch of Canadian poetry will no doubt be surprised at the number of singers and at the high average quality of their work .

		It is difficult to fix upon characteristic qualities in the poetical expression of a whole peo - ple , and this collection , like similar anthologies of the verse of
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, illus - trates nearly all of the moods and intellectual in - terests of the modern mind .

		There is one feature of Canadian song , however , which can not fail to arrest the attention of even the casual reader .

		It is admirably expressed by the editor in these words : '' Here are reflected the singular loveliness of our evanescent
spring	DATE	, the glow and luxuriant life of our hasting
summer	DATE	, the sensuous glory of our autumn , and the tingle of our frosty air and the white winter 's cheer .

		Every form and aspect of natural beauty is , in some degree , caught and ex - pressed sometimes in homely , sometimes in clas - sical phrase ; often with striking simplicity , and generally with much purity of thought and an au - thentic note . ''

		The names of the poets here repre - sented include a few of wider than Canadian renown , the names of
George J. Romanes	PERSON	,
Grant Allen	PERSON	, and Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, for examples .

		As for Professor
Roberts	PERSON	and Mr.
Carman	PERSON	we are now beginning to claim them as at least half our own , since they have taken up permanent residence on this side of the border .

		We regret the absence from this collection of Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's '' Death in
April	DATE	, '' the finest of all his poems , and probably the finest poem ever written by a Canadian .

		We miss also '' The Palms '' of Professor
Roberts	PERSON	, al - though we are consoled by his matchless lyric '' The Falling Leaves . ''

		There are brief biographical notes upon all the poets included , and we learn from them that Professor
Roberts	PERSON	'' was one of the literary arbiters at the World 's Fair ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' which is a dark saying .

		Dr.
R. Osgood Mason	PERSON	supplements hi8 f orme .

		r lume ' '' Telepathy and the Subliminal Self , '' by one en - titled '' Hypnotism and Suggestion in Therapeutics , Education , and Reform '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The matter and manner of both books are much the same .

		Dr.
Mason	PERSON	emphasizes the increased scope of the mental factor in the treatment of disease , and the specific opportunities afforded by hypnotic suggestion in this respect .

		But the success of such psychic thera - peutics , as likewise of the presentation of the topic to a wider public , depends on the tact and acumen , the critical ability and foresight , the avoidance of exaggeration and error , with which it is done .

		On all these points the present volume , when weighed fairly , is found to be wanting .

		There is a fair measure of good material ; the account of cases treated is particularly interesting and worthy of record ; and when compared with such a pernicious volume as the recent one of Quackenbos , this book assumes a comparatively meritorious character .

		But when judged by what an account of this topic should be , its success is quite overshadowed by its defects .

		Much of the volume is concerned with exaggerated theories of the influence of the uncon - scious self , with telepathy which foresees the future , and with rapport which transcends ordinary men - tal powers .

		Within the special field of hypnotic education , we have not only cases of nervous weak - nesses , bad habits , and mental assymetries success - fully treated by hypnotic suggestion ; but even bad spelling and incorrect English yield to this per - suasive method .

		But it is not so much the aesthetic judgment of the author that arouses condemnation as his intellectual judgment .

		The most weakly evidenced occurrences , the most weakly established theories , are considered as of equal importance and credibility as any others ; while any refusal to agree with the author in these peregrinations is set down to prejudice and lack of fair-mindedness .

		Such a democracy of facts and hypotheses in which there shall be freedom and equality to one and all , would be bereft of all logical worth .

		It is not open - mindedness that is wanted in the discussion of these problems so much as it is critical judgment and logical insight .

		Men do not to-day refuse to look through any telescope that promises to show them anything worth looking at .

		Stubbornness and dog - matism are not the bugbears that they are generally regarded to be .

		It is not any conservative clinging to old-fashioned balances t that prevents our results from being more reliable than they are ; but it is insufficient training in the employment of the new ones .

		And so long as this state of affairs continues , we shall have writers like Dr.
Mason	PERSON	mixing to - gether much that is reliable and suggestive -LRB- and still more that is interesting -RRB- , with much more that is questionable in all respects , serving uncritical res - urrections of
Reichenbach	PERSON	's sensitives , and theories of psychic intuition , and explanations of heredity by subconscious personalities , and abuses of the sig - nificance of '' experimental psychology , '' along with some valid and pertinent considerations of the scope of the mental in the treatment of physical , intellectual , moral , and educational deficiencies .


Albert Sonnichsen	PERSON	, the author of SJt : `` Ten Months a Captive among Fili - pinos '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is what his por - trait shows him to be , and his book abundantly proves , a young American of great candor , great adaptability , little learning , and none too intelligent
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 prejudices .

		His book is , as the sub-title declares , ' A Narrative of Adventure and Observation during Imprisonment on the Island of
Luzon	LOCATION	, '' and the map showing his itinerary attests the opportunities given him for seeing the workings of
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	's government during the time he was held prisoner .

		Interesting as the account is , the chief interest lies in the facts that the author did not know himself to be disclosing .

		He is not aware , for example , that he is constantly judging his captors by a standard which he does not make the slightest at - tempt to live up to himself a common fault with us all , perhaps , but more than ordinarily significant when the attitude of the writer is one of inevitable and invincible superiority .

		Another instance is to be found in the fact that his chief miseries came , not in the least from his darker-skinned guards , but from a fellow-member of the Anglo-Saxon race , an Englishman whom be significantly calls Arnold .

		Taken just before the American rifles , advanced several miles beyond the environs of
Manila	LOCATION	, to which they were limited by the terms of the peace protocol , had opened fire upon our recent allies , young
Sonnichsen	PERSON	was enabled to escape by
Joaquin Alejandrino	PERSON	, and returned safely to
Manila	LOCATION	by the ''
Oregon	LOCATION	. ''

		He bears cheerful witness to the hu - manity of the Filipinos , and to the huge distress brought upon them by the American occupation .

		His book is entertaining and instructive , and throws many valuable side-lights on the dark picture in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Like other readers of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's earlier plays , we looked for - ward to '' Plays for Puritans '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- with pleasurable anticipation .

		We read them with successive and often mingled feelings .

		The Prefaces , of course , gratified our love of smart - ness . ''

		The Devil 's Disciple , '' however , was a great disappointment at the beginning , and we only roused to a sort of conventional interest in the last act .

		We were amused at the succeeding note on Bur - goyne .

		At the beginning of '' Cesar and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra '' our spirit needed stimulant , and the play provided what was wanted of the best quality .

		With the Notes our spirit sunk again , and '' Captain Brassbound 's Conversion '' we began with a certain weariness .

		This was largely caused , however , by the philological difficulties interposed by the dia - lectic spelling in the first act , for on getting to the real matter we revived and finished in style .

		So that on the whole the net result was good : it is true that the book is not everywhere of the author 's very best , but that is by no means remarkable .

		These plays are for Puritans because Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	de - sires to harp on some other string than the amatory .

		He explains himself in one of the Prefaces : in the plays it appears that he appeals rather to a certain common-sense in mankind which is certainlv more inspiriting than the common sensuousness , as he might call it himself , which most other plays appeal to .

		This common-sense
Caesar	PERSON	and Lady
Cicely	PERSON	have so much of it and are so winning thereby is an excellent article , and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's recognition of it constitutes his real realism .

		If only people would not pretend this and that , if only they would be real .

		In '' The Devil 's Disciple '' we unfortu - nately -LRB- for ourselves -RRB- miss this element ; we find little more reality in the play than in the locality of the play , which is south of
Boston	LOCATION	and north of
Albany	LOCATION	and yet in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and , in addi - tion , a place where there were Presbyterians in
1777	DATE	.

		We do not get interested in '' Diabolonian ethics '' either in theory or practice .

		But Lady Cicely brings up the balance , leaving ''
Caesar	PERSON	and Cleopatra '' to the good very decidedly .

		We can not think this last a very playlike play , but it is excellent reading .

		Some things seem a trifle ab - surd , as when Britannus declares that there should be a matron when
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	visits
Cesar	PERSON	, and much has a contagions levity , as when
Caesar	PERSON	is inspired to leap into the sea and swim to the Rhodian gal - leys and they toss Cleopatra into the water after him .

		Still it would be bad to have monotony even in excellence , and such breaks are doubtless useful as a relief from the serious strength and even thought of the piece as a whole .

		The name of
Alexander Brown	PERSON	, of Nelson county ,
Virginia	LOCATION	, has long been associated in the field of his - torical literature with some decided views upon the birth of
America	LOCATION	's free institutions .

		He would annihilate the decades of slow political evolution , and have Freedom in present-day garb step forth from the church at
Jamestown	LOCATION	or the cabin of the '' Mayflower . ''

		His latest volume , '' English Politics in
Early Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , essays to prove that our founders first settled this country upon proper political charter rights but were wilfully robbed of this distinction by the crown 's licensed historians . ''

		It is a kind of essence extracted from his '' First Republic of the United States '' and his '' Genesis of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' but colored with defiance and reassertion .

		Like a stag at bay , he turns upon his critics in a kind of preface in the middle of the book , and at the same time discloses the woes of '' the first person under the Republic to undertake sincerely the task of correcting this historic wrong . ''

		He confesses '' the great difficulty of compiling a book in the best form for correcting the wrong impressions which have resulted from an almost absolute control over the history and all the evidences for nearly one hundred and fifty years , by the crown officials '' ; the long search for '' a publisher liberal enough and patriotic enough to undertake the publication of an article or a book opposing opinions which have grown gray with age and become popular '' ; and then the difficulty of '' selling a sufficient number of advance orders to justify the printing , etc. '' Yet he is led to rejoice that the press and historians who under former license might have burned his books and imprisoned him can now only '' roast '' him , as he puts it .

		Even 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, those who can not follow him in reading into the commercial lives of our fathers our high political ideals , nor in thinking a king would employ his time in such trivial matters as planning to suppress evidences of free ideas among his few colonists , must give the author credit for earnestness and a militant spirit , although they look with forbearing pity on his rather unequal combat with the armor - clad knights of long-existing conclusions .

		The search for novel ideas in history need go no further than this recent production of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	.

		The love-letters of eminent people now to tne f ore w i t h tne The love-letters of Victor Hugo .

		, , .

		... publishers , and the way in which these tender missives are being exploited as an asset by their thrifty custodians should be a caution to celebrities now living .

		The latter , it seems , if they dread this form of post-mortem publicity , will do well either to follow the example of Mr.
Barkis	PERSON	when they go a-wooing , or else to see to it person - ally that their epistolary billings and cooings are consigned to the flames before their heirs and the public get a chance at them .

		We have now before us a very pretty volume of nearly three hundred pages containing '' The Love - Letters of Victor Hugo '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , to Mile .


Adele Foucher	PERSON	, many or all of which have already been published in the magazines , where they naturally and deservedly attracted much attention , both on account of the great name of their author , and of their singular charm and interest as characteristic compositions of their kind .

		In his Introduction to the volume , the helpful , if somewhat rapturous , editor ,
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	, assures us , by way of whetting our appe - tite for the banquet to follow , that , '' They evidently were not written to be seen by other eyes than those of the girl he loved ; he constantly entreats her to burn them ; they are all the more valuable on that account . ''

		The above view will hardly commend itself to a delicate sense of propriety , and seems rather at odds with a well-known convention long prevalent among gentlemen .

		But there is no doubt that the unrestrictedly frank and self - revealing character of the letters , and their consequent value as records of the inner life of the writer , are in a way guaranteed by the fact that he wanted them kept secret ; and this is perhaps what M. Meurice means to imply .

		The letters cover a period of two years , from
1820	DATE	to
1822	DATE	.

		They are love-letters pure and simple , the rapturous outpourings of a youth of genius who has nothing to conceal from his mistress , and whose pen paints with delicate fidelity the fluctuating emotions of the lover 's heart .

		The volume is a tasteful one outwardly , and con - tains some interesting portraits .

		So far as our observation goes , the anada .

		ave .

		ra g e well-read citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	the word American will not serve in this case knows less of the his - tory of our political neighbor on the North since the times of which
Parkman	ORGANIZATION	treats , and of her development , than he knows of any important country of
Europe	LOCATION	or
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Yet the history of
Canada	LOCATION	is related to our own at many points , and is full of interest for this reason as well as interest - ing in itself .

		Hence the latest addition to the ex - cellent '' Cambridge Historical Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- commands attention for its theme , ''
Canada	LOCATION	,
1760 1900	DATE	, '' as well as for its excellence .

		The author is Sir
John G. Bourinot	PERSON	, a scholar and writer of reputation , and probably the highest authority on Canadian history .

		He first gives a sketch of the French Regime , then takes up the settlement of the several parts of the country , then the development of representative institutions .

		This last forms a most interesting story , complicated as it was with the race jealousies of French and English , religious differences , provincial rivalries , and the ideas and prejudices inherited on the one side from fugitive Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies , and on the other from the French absolutism of the Old Regime .

		The author gives another side of the history of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	and of the War of
1812	DATE	from that presented by our own writers .

		He gives the Canadian view of
Samuel Adams	PERSON	as agitator and conspirator , and of the insufficiency and pettiness of the causes alleged for our separation from En - gland ; of the puerility of our management of the War of
1812	DATE	; and , in the last chapter , of
Canada	LOCATION	's relations with the
United States	LOCATION	, in orderly survey from
1783	DATE	to
1900	DATE	, boundaries , fisheries , trade , in - cluding the questions now in dispute between the countries .

		We give our hearty commendation of the book as an interesting story of political develop - ment , as casting side-lights on our own history , and as a valuable reference book .

		The collecting of book-plates -LRB- qua book-plates -RRB- is said to have begun in
1820	DATE	with a Miss
Jenkins	PERSON	of Bath ,
England	LOCATION	.

		Her collection , seventeen years later , furnished the nucleus of what has since become one of the largest in
England	LOCATION	.

		The literature of the subject began in
France	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	, and in En - gland six years later ; and has been increased since then in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, by numerous volumes and a flood of periodical con - tributions .

		At the present time , the interest taken in these sometimes artistic bits of paper is undoubt - edly widespread and steadily increasing .

		To the periodical literature of the subject , Mr.
W. G. Bowdoin	PERSON	has been a frequent , persistent , and pro- lific contributor .

		He is therefore well qualified to inform the public about book-plates , but his '' Rise of the Book-Plate '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- does not give us as much historical knowledge of the subject as we might be led to expect , though it is precisely the kind of book the collector of ex libris will find in - dispensable .

		It contains an Introduction and a paper on '' The Study and Arrangement of Book - Plates '' by Mr.
Henry Blackwell	PERSON	, a veteran collec - tor ; two essays by Mr.
Bowdoin	PERSON	, in defense of
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 collecting and in `` exemplification of the art '' ; a page of names of American book-plate designers ; a bibliography and lists of contributors to American and English book-plate literature ; and a list of book-plate inscriptions not nearly as full as it might be made without risk of becoming tiresome .

		The remaining pages are devoted to fac-similes of more than two hundred German , Austrian , Belgian , Italian , Arabic ,
Welsh	LOCATION	, French , English , Canadian , and American book-plates , showing the extent of Mr.
Bowdoin	PERSON	's collection and the immense diversity of styles employed in the production of a book - plate .

		Unfortunately , a great number of Mr. Bow - doin 's examples suffer by being reproduced in miniature .

		If the annual output of works on '' etiquette '' were any criterion , the American carries the national quality of common-sense into his personal behavior to a very slight extent .

		In another aspect , such a work as Miss
Emily Holt	PERSON	's '' Encyclopaedia of Etiquette '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an indication of the national longing for the best , and its sub-titles , `` What to Write , What to Wear , What to Do , What to Say , '' and '' A Book of Manners for Every - day Use , '' are only expressions of that democracy which believes itself to be as good as anybody or anything , and needs nothing more than the telling to put it into demonstration .

		Yet it is manifest that any person certain of his breeding can not possibly require such a volume ; and no less certain that a person without breeding can not be given it by a library full of similar works .

		It must , there - fore , be intended for that large class , like
Mahomet	PERSON	's coffin in respect of heaven and earth , which is neither in nor out of good society or at least is not in bad society .

		Every social plane has its own conventions , and these are the birthright of all born within its domain .

		What
Miss Holt	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken to do is to show what those people in
Europe	LOCATION	who believe themselves to be better than the common herd do when they have money enough , and , by a parity of reasoning , what Americans should do when they come into a fortune sufficient to warrant their breaking into a class of equal wealth previously acquired .

		If they trust to her book they will not go very far wrong , and if they do not none will discover it unless they happen to read the same book .

		The reputation already established south
Carolina	LOCATION	b Mr
Edward McCrady	PERSON	, a member in the Revolution .

		J _ , ' , 7 _ , , .

		of the
Charleston	LOCATION	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	, bar , in his two volumes on the early history of his
State	ORGANIZATION	, is not likely to be diminished in his new '' History of
South Carolina	LOCATION	in the Revolution '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The first part of the book is an ex - cellent description of the rise and growth of the civil revolution in the
Palmetto State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It does justice to
Drayton	LOCATION	,
Gadsden	LOCATION	,
Laurens	PERSON	, the Rut - ledges , and many others , whose work in the good cause has long been overshadowed by that of pa - triots in the northern colonies where chroniclers and newspapers more abounded .

		The author makes no attempt to shield or explain away the early un - popularity of the patriot cause , and the frequent dissensions of its constituents .

		As the later years of the war proper approach , and the tide of battle turns toward
South Carolina	LOCATION	, the author finds him - self encumbered with a mass of tactical detail and campaign minutiae which makes three-fourths of his book a military history .

		At last , after almost nine hundred pages , he stops abruptly at the close of the year
1780	DATE	with the statement that another volume will be necessary to complete the subject .

		This might better have been stated clearly upon the title page .

		There is no attempt to laud unduly the achievements of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, or detract from those of the other States .

		The facts are presented with the directness of the lawyer .

		The references are not voluminous but are well chosen .

		The sub - ject matter is illustrated by a number of plans of battles .

		If the Rev.
John M. Bacon	PERSON	had written his book `` By Land and Sky '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- with a view to converting his fellow-men to ballooning , he could not have manifested more enthusiasm , nor set forth the joys he has experienced high above the earth more eloquently .

		It is a book which can be read for pure pleasure , uncontaminated by any selfish and few mundane considerations .

		It contains many accounts of the fearless author 's voyages in the clouds , in times of sun and moon , of calm and storm , and all of them made thrilling by the cer - tainty that coming to earth is a vastly more com - plicated and exciting business than sailing away from it .

		There are four excellent pictures , and a general avoidance of technicalities and statistics such as might weary the general reader .

		At the same time there is an abundance of well-distributed information and pertinent observation .

		If any one is hesitating between staying on the ground or as - cending to the skies , Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	's book can be relied upon to decide him in favor of ascent .

		If interest in an author and the probable permanence of that interest may in a measure be understood from the number of books written about him , we may safely conclude that
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	is fairly secure in the present and prospective re - gard of the lovers of books .

		Within less than a twelve-month two volumes dealing with his life and work have come to our table , besides another some - what ambitious volume giving considerable space to the discussion of his art .

		The latest study of
Stevenson	PERSON	, by Mr.
H. Bellyse Baildon	PERSON	, is the work of an old schoolmate of
Stevenson	PERSON	's , and therefore displays a delightfully intimate acquaint - ance with the man in his relation to the product of his pen .

		The book does not make pretense to the dignity of a well-rounded biography , but it traces the development of the delicate sensitive 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, boy into the artist with the closeness of insight of a man who knew and loved his dead friend well , and who knows and loves books .

		And the fact that they were '' chums '' together in an Edin - burgh school has not lessened Mr.
Baildon	PERSON	's critical acumen and made him a blind hero - worshipper .

		As severe upon
Stevenson	PERSON	's faults as the case war - rants , he does not stop with the criticism of them , but goes on to a discussion of them as a part of the strangely rich and complex personality of the au - thor .

		The especial merit of the book , aside from the engaging ease of the style , is perhaps the care - ful and penetrating sureness of this analysis .

		All in all , the volume is illuminating and helpful , and certainly it is enjoyable .

		The bibliography at the end contains a long list of books and articles about
Stevenson	PERSON	, but there should be place for this one also .

Wessels	PERSON	. -RRB-

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A delightful little book in a number of ways is the recent reprint of
James Puckle	PERSON	's '' The Club ; or , a Grey Cap for a Green Head , '' issued in this country by Messrs.
Truslove	PERSON	,
Hanson & Comba	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the book itself , an eighteenth-century collection of '' moral max - ims , '' little more than an antiquarian interest attaches .

		The chief concern of the book-lover of to-day with Puckle 's '' Club '' lies in the series of designs made for the edition of
1817	DATE	by
James Thurston	PERSON	, and cut on wood by some of the foremost engravers of the time .

		These beautiful examples of an art now almost extinct are carefully reproduced in the present reprint , and together with Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's sparkling introduc - tion and the handsome typography of the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	make it a volume to be coveted .

		The great literary activity of the Rev.
Sabine Baring	PERSON	-
Gould	PERSON	is bound to show itself in carelessness of style and negligence in presenting facts .

		His '' Virgin Saints and Martyrs '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- shows these unpleasant quali - ties , quite as much as the wide and curious erudition which is the author 's .

		The main part of the book is drawn from the sixteen - volume `` Lives of the Saints '' which was completed in
1898	DATE	, with the later pages de - voted to that self-sacrificing Englishwoman ,
Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison	PERSON	, to whom Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	accords the honors of beatification or sanctification on his own initiative , under the name of Sister Dora .

		Many illus - trations embellish the present book , most of them ex - cellent wood-cuts after famous paintings .

		The following German and French text-books are the latest to appear upon our table : Frey tag 's '' Soil und Haben '' -LRB- Heath -RRB- , greatly condensed , and edited by Dr.

Webster	PERSON	's `` Unabridged Dictionary , '' the copyright of which is owned by
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	, the original pub - lishers .

		A heavy reduction in the price of the work is one of the innovations contemplated .

		The series of '' Masters in Art , '' published by
the Bates & Guild Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, represents an excellent idea intelligently carried out .

		Each of the monthly issues is devoted to one of the world 's great painters or sculptors .

		The contents comprise ten reproductions in half-tone of the artist 's most representative productions , an accurate short account of his life , opinions on his work selected from the world 's best critics , and a bib - liography and list of paintings .

		The illustrations are wonderfully good examples of the half-tone process , and the entire make-up of the little magazine is artistic and attractive .

		Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	sends us '' The Literary Year - book and
Bookman	PERSON	's Directory for
1901	DATE	, '' edited by Mr.
Herbert Morrah	PERSON	.

		This is an English work , and , as such , does not appeal directly to the interests of American readers .

		It contains , however , much matter of general interest , and will not be found without its use for reference in this country .

		A portrait of the late Bishop of
London	LOCATION	is given for a frontispiece , and the text includes a directory of authors , another of publishers , still another of booksellers , and much mis - cellaneous matter upon such subjects as copyright , periodicals , the drama , and literary societies .

		A '' History of the Christian Religion to the Year Two Hundred , '' by Judge
Charles B. Waite	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, is a work first published about twenty years ago .

		It has gone through several editions , and the one now be - fore us -LRB- the fifth -RRB- has had the benefit of a complete revision , owing to the fact that the original plates were destroyed , which made it possible to rewrite the work much more thoroughly than would otherwise have been the case .

		The work has had a considerable popular vogue , but the author 's critical equipment does not seem to be altogether adequate to his task .

		Messrs.
C. V. Waite & Co	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, are the publishers .

EDOUARD P. BAILLOT Northwestern University Evanston	ORGANIZATION	, 111 .

		THE PURPOSE of this series of books is to supply reading material for the latter part of the first year and the early part of the second year of the students ' work in French .

		While the books , therefore , are easy reading , each one has a distinct place in the study of the language .

		To this end , introductions and notes are explanatory and suggestive , and each of the volumes is provided with a vocabulary .

		The books are bound in brown cloth with back and side stamp , and are very attractive volumes for the student 's library .

		Price ,
50 cents	MONEY	each .

		This selection of plays will be found simple enough for early reading , and will hold the interest of beginners .

		The book will give the student some acquaintance with the kind of literature in which the language is rich .

		It contains `` LA GRAMMAIRE , '' by
Eugene Labiche	PERSON	, `` LA JOIE FAIT PEUR , '' by
Madame Emile de Girardin	PERSON	, and '' LES DOIGTS DE FEE , '' by
Eugene Scribe	PERSON	, all of which are standard .

		Many teachers of French find that their students do not understand and appreciate the works which they are called upon to read , because of their ignorance of the most ordinary facts of French History .

		How and when to give this neces - sary information has become a problem everywhere , and it is to aid in the solution of this problem that the present book has been published .

		The style of the book is so simple that it may be put into the hands of pupils as soon as they have acquired a knowledge of the principal irregular verbs .

		The text is mainly that of a little book used in the schools of
France	LOCATION	with some rearrangement and additions .

		Each chapter is followed by a series of questions to bring out the facts of the chapter by way of conversational review .

		The book contains a map of
France	LOCATION	.

		The book contains nine short stories by
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	,
Ludovic Halevy	PERSON	,
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	fils ,
Henry Lavedan	PERSON	, and
Paul Margueritte	PERSON	.

		These authors are among the foremost of the
second half of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		THE DIAL 361 Thp MarmiHan rnmmmv Begs to Announce Mr.
WINSTON	PERSON	1 lie iTidtmuidn company CHURCHILL 'S New Novel THE CRISIS ' 4 ``
RICHARD CARVEL	PERSON	, '' the author says , was written as the first of a series of novels which , while in no sense sequels or interrelated in any way , have a distinct historical sequence as pictures of American life at different periods .

		In that book we followed the character of the Cavalier , both in the colonial society of
Maryland	LOCATION	and the fashionable life of
London	LOCATION	prior to and during the early days of the American Revolution .

		The scenes of '' THE CRISIS '' are laid in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, nearly a century Liter .

		The heroine of the story ,
Virginia Carvel	PERSON	, a great-granddaughter of
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, serves to connect the stories in interest .

		The hero ,
Stephen Brice	PERSON	, is a young
New England	LOCATION	lawyer seeking fortune in the Southern city .

		Among the many characters in the historical setting of the story we meet
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, a poor farmer , later the greatest general in the army ;
Sherman	PERSON	, president of a small street car line , later also a conspicuous and pic - turesque figure in the history of his time ; and Lincoln , a struggling country lawyer , later as President in our greatest national crisis .

		To all who followed the fortunes of
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, this charming romance of his great - granddaughter should be filled with interest .

		She sustains most gracefully the family traditions , and in her we can see a nobler , finer
Dorothy Manners	PERSON	of the
19th century	DATE	.

		Aside from the narrative , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has given , with rare skill , a picture of the typical reserved
New England	LOCATION	gentleman , '' fed from within with all the strength he needs , '' as opposed to the haughty , brave aristocrat of the South at the time of the Civil War .

		His pic - tures of
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, and
Sherman	PERSON	are graphic , as may be noted by the following extracts from letters of
Stephen Brice	PERSON	to his mother THE CRISIS Of LINCOLN . ''

		When he saw me , the President rose to his great height , a sombre , towering figure in black .

		He wears a scraggy beard now .

		But the sad smile , the kindly eyes in their dark caverns , the voice all were just the same .

		I stopped when I looked upon the face .

		It was sad and lined when I had known it , but now all the agony endured by the millions , North and South , seemed written on it . ''

		< Do n't yon remember me , Major ? '

		he asked .

		The wonder that he had remembered me !

		I took his big , bony hand , which reminded me of Judge
Whipple	PERSON	's .

		Yes , it was just as if I had been with him always , and he were still the gaunt country lawyer . ''

		Of GRANT . ''

		When the
General	ORGANIZATION	had finished reading the dispatches , he folded them quickly and put them in his pocket . '' '

		Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours , Major , ' he said .

		I talked with him for about half an hour .

		I should rather say talked to him .

		He is a marked contrast to
Sherman	LOCATION	in this respect .

		I believe that he only opened his lips to ask two questions .

		Yon may well believe that they were worth the asking , and that they revealed an intimate knowledge of our march from
Savannah	LOCATION	.

		I was interrupted many times by the arrival of different generals , aides , etc. .

		He sat there smoking , imperturbable .

		Sometimes he said ' yes ' or < no , ' but oftener he merely nodded his head .

		Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant , who floundered .

		The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he had in hand . ''

		Of SHERMAN . ''

		I think his simplicity his most remarkable trait .

		You should see him as he rides through the army , an erect figure , with his clothes all angular and awry , and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes .

		Yon can hear his name running from file to file ; and sometimes the new regiments can ' t resist cheering .

		He generally says to the Colonel : ` Stop that noise , sir .

		Do n't like it . ' ''

		The great popularity of ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' 375,000 copies of this novel having been sold , has led the publishers to print 100,000 copies for the first edition of '' The Crisis . ''

		The indi - cations are that the first orders will consume the entire stock .

		380 PRESCIENT PHILANTHROPY .

		Philanthropy in the form of charity , in the form of immediate succor for the suffering and relief for the needy , is doubtless as old as human pity itself .

		When all due credit is given to the benevolence of the motives that have inspired this sort of philanthropy , all the way from individual almsgiving to the estab - lishment of great eleemosynary institutions , the sorrowful fact remains that the history of such endeavor is in large measure a history of mis - placed sympathy , of injudicious sacrifice , of the application of remedies that do not reach the root of the evil sought to be combated .

		The scientific study of such matters as poor-law relief , the endowment of hospitals and asylums , and the collective efforts of communities to deal with the conditions of temporary distress , brings clearly into prominence the fact that the best of intentions in these directions are likely to do an amount of indirect harm suf - ficient to counteract all the direct good result - ing from them .

		What these well-meant philan - thropies do in the way of pauperizing their objects , in the way of undermining individual resolution and sapping the sturdiness of indi - vidual character , must be taken into account no less than the temporary alleviations with which they are to be credited .

		The sum of immediate human suffering is so great at all times , and its evidences so apparent , that it is difficult for the tender-hearted observer to re - main philosophical in its presence , yet we are morally bound to hesitate in coming to its re - lief , if by so doing we are helping to perpetuate the conditions which give it birth .

		That this danger is a real one is a conclusion now so well-established by sociological investigation as to be beyond the reach of controversy .

		It is , then , with feelings of mingled satis - faction and disapproval that the sociologist must view the strengthening of old charities and the multiplication of new ones by the do - nations and the bequests of which we read from day to day .

		It is hard to look such gift horses in the mouth , for the benefactors by whom they are offered are actuated by the most generous of motives , and a vital human 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, sympathy , even if misdirected or injudiciously applied , deserves generous responsive recog - nition .

		But the clear-sighted lover of his fellows will , on the whole , welcome a new educational foundation , or any other new en - dowment that tends to minister to the spiritual rather than the physical needs of men , with a gratitude more unreserved than that with which he can welcome the more common manifesta - tions of the philanthropic spirit .

		The one is sure to remain a blessing for all time to come ; the other may quite possibly , and in the long run , accentuate the very sort of distress which it seeks to relieve .

		However admirable may be the philanthropy that vents itself upon hunger , and nakedness , and disease , it is a still more admirable philanthropy that concerns itself with the future of the race , and that has for its aim the intellectual and ethical advance - ment of the coming generations .

		This prescient form of philanthropy is com - ing to be far more characteristic of large givers than it has been in the past , and the fact is a cause for congratulation .

		It seems as though wealthy men were just beginning to realize the possibilities for good in the endowment of edu - cation and scientific research , of literature and art .

		In the field of education alone , the op - portunities offered for the wise use of wealth are practically unlimited .

		The resources of public taxation can never be really adequate for the work of public education .

		Speaking in
Chicago	LOCATION	a year or two ago , President
Eliot	PERSON	referred to the public schools of the city , with their two hundred and fifty thousand pupils , and said that they should have a teacher for every ten children , or fifty thousand teachers in place of the five thousand that they actually do have .

		The suggestion was a startling one , yet not unreasonable .

		Obviously , this amount of teaching can never be provided by the tax - payers , and thus there is almost unlimited scope for private philanthropic activity in connection with the public schools alone .

		The endowment of technical and university education has been unprecedently generous during the past score of years , yet all that has been done in this direction should be considered but an earnest of what may and must be done in the future .

		There is no other form of investment that pays such dividends as an educational institution or system social dividends of intelligence and civic usefulness and heightened public morality .

		A form of educational philanthropy that is coming more and more into vogue of late is that which stimulates reluctant givers to co - operate in the work of educating the youth of the growing generation .

		The gifts of such men as Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	, and Mr.
Pearsons	PERSON	are wisely conditioned upon the rais - ing of large additional sums from other sources .

		Dollar for dollar is the rule with these men , or , as in the case of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's library benefactions , public provision of ten per cent annually upon the original gift .

		This is an admirable plan , for it doubles , or more than doubles , the power of the giver for good , while it also attaches to the acceptance of an endow - ment a certain measure of responsibility which can not fail to bring forth fruit in careful ad - ministration and widespread interest in the institutions concerned .

		This responsibility sometimes assumes such proportions as in the case of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's munificent endow - ment of the Scotch universities that the gift is viewed askance , and accepted with a grudg - ing sort of gratitude .

		It is very amusing to read some of the English and Scotch comment upon this superb benefaction .

		We are told that university tuition without the means of subsistence is a mockery , and the influx of large numbers of students will compel the Scotch universities to enlarge their teaching facilities at the public charge .

		It does not seem to be realized that the very purpose of the gift is to stimulate private endeavor in sending young men to the universities , and public endeavor in enlarging the universities in accordance with the highest conception of national duty .

		To carp at such a gift on the ground of the responsibilities which it entails is an act unworthy of a high-spirited people .

		Such protestants should remain silent for very shame , and seek rather , by every means in their power , to encourage the nation to rise to the height of this great occasion .

		THE
Historical Manuscript Commission	ORGANIZATION	, appointed a few years since by the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, has called fresh attention to its labors of love in its fourth report , being a collection of some five hundred letters written by
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	, and over two hun - dred letters written to him .

		These letters were col - lected by the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	from all parts of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the search occupying several years .

		They embrace both public and private correspondence , showing the great Carolinian both as a statesman and as a family man .

		The volume , issued by the
Smithsonian Institu	ORGANIZATION	- tion as a government publication , at last makes
Calhoun	PERSON	as well known as
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
John Adams	PERSON	, and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, and others have been known by their collected correspondence .

		No attempt has been made to conceal anything , or to emendate or edit , and very wisely , the editor has refrained from comments .

		THE DIAL 365 eta 130ohs .

		THE POETRY OF MR. MOODY .

		* Every two or three years , from some quarter of the critical horizon , there issue trumpetings of praise which herald the advent of a new singer of songs .

		A bright star has swum into the ken of some watcher upon the battlements , and the discovery is proclaimed to the world with much pomp of rhetorical eulogy .

		The number of new poets who have thus been dis - covered during the past quarter-century is considerable , but most of them have shared the fate of the novce known to astronomers , and their magnitude has rapidly become dimmed .

		We have often envied the enthusiasm that could find so much to praise in these new inter - preters of nature and human life , but have felt ourselves sorrowfully compelled to stand out - side the chorus , and to mar its harmonies by the injection of certain discordant notes of caution and temperate restraint .

		A book of poetry must exhibit very great qualities indeed to constitute an event in literature , or to set its writer among the enduring poets of his age .

		In the memory of men now in their middle or advancing years there have been only two such events in English poetry the appearance of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Poems and Ballads '' in
1866	DATE	and of the '' Poems '' of Rossetti in
1870	DATE	.

		Tested by these touchstones , '' The Love Son - nets of Proteus '' and '' The City of Dreadful Night , '' the books of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, have been phenom - ena of only secondary significance .

		Yet the writers of all these books , and other writers as well , have been hailed as new luminaries of the first rank , have been praised in terms that one would hesitate to apply to Arnold or Ten - nyson , and have been made , as far as indis - criminate eulogy could make them , the literary fashion of their respective hours .

		Praiseworthy they doubtless are , but not worthy of the sort of praise that has been injudiciously bestowed upon them to the confusion of all absolute values .

		In making the following somewhat extended comment upon the poetical work of Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, we are not going to say that he is a poet of the highest kind of * THE MASQUE OF JUDGMENT .

		accomplishment , or apply to him the language that must properly be reserved for poets whose work has stood the test of time and remained un corroded by it .

		But we are going to say and by our exhibits seek to prove that no other new poet of the past score of years , either in
America	LOCATION	or in
England	LOCATION	, has displayed a finer promise upon the occasion of his first appearance , or has been deserving of more respectful consideration .

		There is no reason , for example , why his work should attract less attention than has been given of late to the work of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, and we make not the slightest doubt that , had his work been the product of an Englishman , its author would have been accorded the resounding praise that has been accorded to the author of ''
Marpessa	LOCATION	'' and '' Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	. ''

		We wish to say , furthermore , that we have not for many years been so strongly tempted to cast aside critical restraints and indulge in '' the noble pleasure of praising , '' after the fashion , let us say , of the late Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	when dealing with the poetry of Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	.

		Nor do we hesitate to add that , with the possible exception of what has been done by Professor Wood - berry , no such note of high and serious song has been sounded in our recent American poetry as is now sounded in '' The Masque of Judgment '' and the '' Poems '' of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	. ''

		The Masque of Judgment '' is a work that labors under extraordinary difficulties .

		The form itself is one that a writer must be greatly daring to attempt , and the substance is of a sort that heightens the difficulties of the form .

		Like the epics of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	, it is con - cerned with no less a theme than the cosmog - ony ; like ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' it sets speech upon the lips of archangels ; like the '' Prometheus Un - bound , '' it personifies the creations of mythol - ogy .

		It might more fittingly be styled a Mystery than a Masque , but it can not take an easy refuge in the naivetes of medievalism , for it is no imitative exercise in archaism , but a poem conceived in the spirit of modern philosophy .

		So true is this that we are im - pelled to provide it with texts from the writings of the philosophers .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	says : `` It is the fate of life to be restless , capricious , and therefore tragic .

		Happiness comes , in - deed , but by all sorts of accidents ; and it flies as it comes .

		One thing only that is greater than this fate endures in us if we are wise of heart ; and this one thing endures forever in the heart of the great World-Spirit of whose wisdom ours is but a fragmentary reflection .

		366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, This one thing , as I hold , is the eternal resolu - tion that if the world will be tragic , it shall still , in
Satan	LOCATION	's despite , be spiritual .

		And this resolution is , I think , the very essence of the
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	's own eternal joy . ''

		And Professor
James	PERSON	, writing in much the same spirit , says : '' God himself , in short , may draw vital strength and increase of very being from our fidelity .

		For my own part , I do not know what the sweat and blood and tragedy of this life mean , if they mean anything short of this . ''

		On the lips of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's
Raphael	PERSON	, the archangel ic lover of mankind , this philosophy is given melodious utterance . ''

		Darkly , but oh , for good , for good , The spirit infinite Was throned upon the perishable blood ; To moan and to be abject at the neap , To ride portentous on the shrieking scud Of the aroused flood , And halcyon hours to preen and prate in the boon Tropical afternoon . ''

		Not in vain , not in vain , The spirit hath its sanguine stain .

		And from its senses five doth peer As a fawn from the green windows of a wood ; Slave of the panic woodland fear , Boon - fellow in the game of blood and lust That fills with tragic mirth the woodland year ; Searched with starry agonies Through the breast and through the reins , Maddened and led by lone moon-wandering cries .

		Dust unto dust complains , Dust langheth out to dust , Sod unto sod moves fellowship , And the soul utters , as she must , Her meanings with a loose and carnal lip ; But deep in her ambiguous eyes Forever shine and slip Quenchless expectancies , And in a far-off day she seems to put her trust . ''

		Again , and in still clearer language , the arch - angel declares the glory of man 's passionate self-contradictions : '' I have walked The rings of planets where strange-colored moons Hung thick as dew , in ocean orchards feared The glaucous tremble of the living boughs Whose fruit hath life and purpose ; but nowhere Found any law but this : Passion is power , And , kindly tempered , saves .

		All things declare Struggle hath deeper peace than sleep can bring : The restlessness that put creation forth Impure and violent , held holier calm Than that Nirvana whence it wakened Him . ''

		Thus the way is prepared for the
Divine Tragedy	ORGANIZATION	.

		God , having created the race of men , and having sought to save man from him - self by the mystery of the Incarnation , deter - mines at last to destroy the impious brood .

		`` What if they rendered up their wills to His ?

		Hushed and subdued their personality ?

		Became as members of the living tree ? ''

		To
Raphael	PERSON	, thus musing , the Angel of the Pale Horse makes reply : `` A whisper grows , various from tongue to tongue , That so He will attempt .

		Those who consent To render up their clamorous wills to Him , To merge their fretful being in His peace He will accept : the rest He will destroy . ''

		In the fulness of time , the Day of Judgment dawns , and '' God 's vengeance is full wrought '' upon the wicked .

		The following wonderful lyric is sung by the redeemed spirits on their upward flight : '' In the wilds of life astray , Held far from our delight , Following the cloud by day And the fire by night , Came we a desert way .

		O Lord , with apples feed us , With flagons stay !

		By Thy still waters lead us ! ''

		As bird torn from the breast Of mother-cherishings .

		Far from the swaying nest Dies for the mother wings , So did the birth-hour wrest From Thy sweet will and word Our souls distressed .

		Open Thy breast , thou Bird I '' Yet
Raphael	PERSON	, who alone of the celestial hosts has understood the heart of man , and whose imagination has foreshadowed the consequences of his destruction , remains disconsolate .

		`` Never again !

		never again for me !

		Never again the lily souls that live Along the margin of the streams , shall grow More candid at my coming .

		Never more God 's birds above the bearers of the Ark Shall make a wood of implicated wings , Swept by the wind of slow ecstatic song .

		Thy youths shall hold their
summer	DATE	cenacles ; I am not of their fellowship , it seems .

		God 's ancient peace shall feed them , as it feeds These yet uplifted hills .

		I would I knew Where bubbled that insistent
spring	DATE	.

		To drink Deep , and forget what I have seen to-day . ''

		But the destruction of mankind is only the beginning of the Tragedy .

		When that awful fiat went forth , God likewise accomplished His own doom .

		To be dethroned and destroyed by the forces of His own creation is the fate that awaits Him , as it awaited the God of
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian myth in the day of
Ragnarok	LOCATION	, as it awaited the God of Greek myth in
Shelley	LOCATION	's treatment of the tale of Prometheus .

		The instrument of His undoing is the Worm that Dieth not , His own monstrous miscreation , who , having swept mankind from the face of earth at the behest of his Creator , mounts up - ward to commit violent assault upon the hosts of Heaven . ''

		He mounts !

		He lays his length upward the visioned hills , The inviolable fundaments of Heaven !

		There where he climbs the kindled slopes growjpale , Ashen the amethystine dells , and dim The starry reaches . ''

		THE DIAL 367 The closing scene between the Spirits of the Lamps about the Throne , who have fled in terror from the terrific struggle , and the Arch - angels
Raphael	PERSON	and
Uriel	PERSON	, rises to a height of imaginative sublimity that leaves us fairly stricken with awe .

		RAPHAEL .

		The moon smoulders ; and naked from their seats The stars arise with lifted hands , and wait . ''

		We have endeavored to give , in the preced - ing analysis , some idea of the fashion in which Mr.
Moody	PERSON	has dealt with his grandiose con - ception of the Creation , the Christian Mystery , and the Judgment .

		He has shown it possible to make in our own day a very noble poem , as
Milton	PERSON	did , out of the
Biblical Mythology	ORGANIZATION	, and as
Shelley	PERSON	did , out of the most subtle spiritual symbolism .

		The poem is not without minor faults , and criticism of the microscopic sort might easily detect flaws here and there , words inaccurately used or inadequate as vehicles of their intention , forced imagery and moments of flagging imagination .

		We are content to leave to others this thankless task , feeling that the superb merits of the work make its occas - ional crudities quite insignificant .

		We have quoted many of its finest passages , but have reserved for the last the finest of them all this glorious apostrophe to mankind : '' O Dreamer !

		O Desirer !

		Goer down Unto nntravelled seas in untried ships !

		O crusher of the nnimagined grape On uneonceived lips !

		O player upon a lordly instrument No man or god hath had in mind to invent ; O cunning how to shape
Effulgent Heaven	ORGANIZATION	and scoop out bitter Hell From the little shine and saltness of a tear ;
Sieger	PERSON	and harrier , Beyond the moon , of thine own bnilded town , Each morning won , each eve impregnable , Each noon evanished sheer ! ''

		We should not know where in recent poetry to look for the match to this melodious and sym - pathetic portrayal of '' life 's wild and various bloom '' of passion and aspiration , of alter - nating defeat and victory , of the commingling of sense and spirit that makes of our existence so confused a web of self-contradictions , yet somehow suggests a harmony of design that must be apparent to the transcendental vision .

		It is clear that the poet of '' The Masque of Judgment '' is no partisan of the ascetic ideal .

		His plea is for the richness of life , for the legitimate claims of sense no less than of spirit , for the working out of one 's salvation by means that leave no human instinct athirst .

		Nor is his ideal one for the few favored by nature or circumstance ; it is rather the all - embracing expression of a fine trust in the whole of human nature .

		This democratic out - look , which is somewhat obscured by the sym - bolism demanded for the dramatic work we have just had under discussion , is given a more definite expression in the volume of the '' Poems , '' to which we now turn .

		We find it in '' Gloucester Moors , '' with which the book opens , a striking poem which likens the earth 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, to a ship bound with its freight of souls for some unknown port . ''

		But thou , vast outbound ship of souls , What harbor town for thee ?

		What shapes , when thy arriving tolls , Shall crowd the banks to see ?

		Shall all the happy shipmates then Stand singing brotherly ?

		Or shall a haggard ruthless few Warp her over and bring her to , While the many broken souls of men Fester down in the slaver 's pen , And nothing to say or do ? ''

		It takes a robust optimism to bear up under the spectacle afforded by the darker aspects of human life , its physical failings and its spiritual agonies , and the mood of '' A Grey Day '' holds the poet under its obsession more than once .

		`` I wonder how that merchant 's crew Have ever found the will !

		I wonder what the fishers do To keep them toiling still !

		I wonder how the heart of man Has patience to live out its span , Or wait until its dreams come true . ''

		But this mood is not lasting , nor does it in - sistently prevail in the writer 's consciousness .

		Whatever the defeats life may bring , the strong spirit will not be cowed , nor will it seek a refuge in quietism .

		Some stanzas written '' At
Assisi	LOCATION	'' give us a clear statement of the poet 's philosophy . ''

		I turn away from the gray church pile ; I dare not enter , thus undone : Here in the roadside grass awhile I will lie and watch for the sun .

		Too purged of earth 's good glee and strife , Too drained of the honied lusts of life , Was the peace these old saints won !

		`` St.
Francis	PERSON	sleeps upon his hill , And a poppy flower laughs down his creed ; Triumphant light her petals spill , His shrines are dim indeed .

		Men build and build , but the soul of man , Coming with haughty eyes to scan , Feels richer , wilder need . ''

		How long , old builder Time , wilt bide Till at thy thrilling word Life 's crimson pride shall have to bride The spirit 's white accord , Within that gate of good estate Which thou must build us soon or late ,
Hoar	PERSON	workman of the Lord ? ''

		There is not a poem among the score or more contained in Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's volume that is commonplace or devoid of some arresting quality of imagery or emotion .

		Regretfully passing by the greater number of them we reserve our remaining space for the two pieces inspired by the dark page of recent American history .

		Our broken national faith , our lust of dominion , the subordination of morality to greed in our international dealings , and our desertion of the principles upon which our greatness as a people has hitherto been based , these are things that have made the last two years a period of inexpressible sadness to Americans who have been taught to cherish the teachings of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, of Sumner and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		How we have longed for the indignant words of protest that our
Whittier	LOCATION	or our Emerson or our
Lowell	PERSON	would have voiced had their lives reached down to this unhappy time !

		But in reading Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's '' Ode in Time of Hesitation '' and his lines '' On a Soldier Fallen in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines '' we are almost consoled for the silence of the prophet - voices that appealed so power - fully to the moral consciousness of the gene - ration before our own .

		We seem to catch the very accent of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's patriotic fervor in these lines suggested by the
Shaw Memorial	ORGANIZATION	: `` Crouched in the sea-fog on the moaning sand All night he lay , speaking some simple word From hour to hour to the slow minds that heard , Holding each poor life gently in his hand And breathing on the base rejected clay Till each dark face shone mystical and grand Against the breaking day ; And lo , the shard the potter cast away Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine Fulfilled of the divine Great wine of battle wrath by God 's ring-finger stirred .

		Then upward , where the shadowy bastion loomed Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light , Whence now , and now , infernal flowerage bloomed , Bloomed , burst , and scattered down its deadly seed , They swept , and died like freemen on the height , Like freemen , and like men of noble breed . ''

		Contrast this bright picture of heroic devotion to a great cause with the dark picture presented by the successors of these men now engaged in the bloody subjugation of an alien people who have done naught to offend us , and whose crime is that they love their country well enough to die by thousands for its sake . ''

		I will not and I dare not yet believe !

		Though furtively the sunlight seems to grieve , And the spring-laden breeze Out of the gladdening west is sinister With sounds of nameless battle over seas ; Though when we turn and question in suspense If these things be indeed after these ways , And what things are to follow after these , Our fluent men of place and consequence Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow phrase , Or for the end-all of deep arguments Intone their dull commercial liturgies I dare not yet believe !

		My ears are shut !

		I will not hear the thin satiric praise And muffled laughter of our enemies , Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian 's hut Showing how wise it is to cast away The symbols of our spiritual sway , That so our hands with better ease
May	DATE	wield the driver 's whip and grasp the jailer 's keys . ''

		THE DIAL 369 By the memory of the fine altruistic impulse that stirred our national heart when the suf - fering Cubans besought us for aid , let it not be said of us that a mean motive underlay that frank outburst of active sympathy , that our protestations of unselfishness were the merest hypocrisy , and that our soldiers have given up their lives that their country might be dis - honored . ''

		We charge yon , ye who lead us , Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain !

		Torn not their new-world victories to gain !

		One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays Of their dear praise , One jot of their pore conquest put to hire , The implacable republic will require .

		For save we let the island men go free .

		Those baffled and dislaarelled ghosts Will curse us from the lamentable coasts Where walk the frustrate dead .

		The cup of trembling shall be drained quite .

		Eaten the sour bread of astonishment , With ashes of the hearth shall be made white Oar hair , and wailing shall be in the tent . ''

		This impressive adjuration is supplemented by the lines suggested by the death of General
Lawton	PERSON	. ''

		A. flag for the soldier 's bier Who dies that his land may live ; O , banners , banners here , That we doubt not nor misgive !

		That he heed not from the tomb The evil days draw near When the nation , robed in gloom .

		With its faithless past shall strive .

		Let him never dream that his ballet 's scream went wide of its island mark , Home to the bean of his darling land where she stumbled and sinned in the dark . ''

		When our nation shall have won back its sanity , and once more learned to heed al - though at what cost we tremble to think the lessons of righteousness taught us by the Fathers of the Republic , these poems will seem as stars seen through the angry cloud-rifts of a tempestuous night , bearing shining witness to the fact that in our hour of darkness there were some souls that held the faith undaunted by all the powers of evil leagued against them .

		We are somehow reminded of an eloquent simi - litude employed by the late
Frederic Myers	PERSON	.

		Speaking of the judgment of the men to come upon still another poet who , like Mr.
Moody	PERSON	, would not despair of a seemingly hopeless cause , he said : '' They will look back on him as Romans looked back on that unshaken Roman who purchased at its full price the field of Cannae , on which at that hour victorious Hannibal lay encamped with his Carthaginian

		Cox 's WAR REMINISCENCES .

		* The two handsome volumes of '' Military Reminiscences '' of the late Major-General
Jacob Dolson	PERSON	Cox form a very valuable con - tribution to the literature of the Civil War .

		The author was a scholar to begin with , and was always a student .

		During many years preceding his death he had wide experience as a critic , often reviewing books on the Civil War period , noting what was omitted by others , what was said in extravagant statement , what took the form of positive misconception of facts .

		Uniting in himself the education requisite to just judgment , the experience of a general in actual campaign work , and the special training afforded by his later life , he was fitted as few could be to produce , a gen - eration after the war , a story regarding it of the greatest interest and importance .

		The worth of his production is enhanced because , as
General Cox	ORGANIZATION	was not one of the greatest officers developed by the war , atten - tion to the personality of the man does not obscure the details of his story , and conse - quently the two volumes are a very valuable source of information on questions relating to that trying time , and not alone a showing of the achievements of a single individual , as , unfortunately , has been the case with many volumes of memoirs published during the last decade .

		| The military career of
General Cox	ORGANIZATION	was largely devoted to the campaigns in West Vir - ginia , in
East Tennessee	LOCATION	, and with
Sherman	PERSON	on his famous '' March to the Sea . ''

		There was , indeed , a digression for awhile to
Antietam	LOCATION	, with a resulting account of the battle there which might possibly lead to criticism , but the early return to
West Virginia	LOCATION	from the army in the
East	LOCATION	would seem to make this rather an | episode in the man 's military life than an organic part of it .

		Without noting particularly the details which are presented in connection with the occupa - tion of
East Tennessee	LOCATION	and the march through
Georgia	LOCATION	, the campaign in
West Virginia	LOCATION	may ; be taken to furnish abundant material for an appreciation of the
General	ORGANIZATION	's conception of warfare .

		Nowhere else is there such a clear account of the operations in the new mountain
State	ORGANIZATION	, which , turning to freedom , broke away from the Old Dominion and entered the Union MILITARY REMINISCENCES OF THE CIVIL WAB .

		370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, as a separate commonwealth .

		Occupying a place on the border line between the tide-water regions south of the Potomac and the great Central West , the possession of
West Virginia	LOCATION	had a two-fold importance .

		As a political measure it was essential that there should be an early massing of the army of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	to sustain the people in their determination to stand by the country as against the champions of slavery , and when so many Americans were turning away from their allegiance , justice re - quired that if support were needed it should be given heartily to the friends of freedom .

		$ | From a military standpoint the State was even more important .

		It was the gateway from
Ohio	LOCATION	to
Virginia	LOCATION	, and therefore absolutely essential to the successful operations of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	forces .

		Because of the rough and rugged nature of the soil there were only a few routes by which an army could march across the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		These routes might easily have been defended with comparatively small expense , but as a matter of fact much outlay was re - quired to secure them .

		The early movements in
West Virginia	LOCATION	had a great deal to do with shaping the general conduct of the war , because it was owing to the brilliancy of achievements there that General
McClellan	PERSON	was called to be head of the armies .

		Those chapters which discuss
McClellan	PERSON	have much interest , and the estimate made by Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	and Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	in their histories of the period are fully sustained by the statements from
General Cox	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , after all , the lessons learned from a study of the campaign in
West Virginia	LOCATION	involv - ing a great many problems of warfare , such as , for example , the handling of raw recruits , the dealing with newspaper men , some of them not particularly scrupulous in their methods or careful of the interests of their country , the peculiar conditions of life due to the isolation of the people , the irregular guerilla fighting on both sides , do not impress one as so import - ant as the general information in the volumes on topics such as the ''
Vallandigham Case	PERSON	, '' `` Morgan 's Raid , '' '' The Knights of the Golden Circle , '' the plot to liberate prisoners at
John	PERSON	- son 's
Island	LOCATION	, etc. .

		A striking feature of
General Cox	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs is the comparison in quality of the volunteers and the regulars , or of the volunteer officers and those who had the benefit of West Point training .

		One gets a pretty definite notion that the members of the regular army rather suffered by comparison with the volunteers , who came from every walk in life because of devotion to the cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and fought for flag and country from sentiment rather than from the necessity of military discipline .

		As Mr.
Cox	PERSON	puts it , '' A bold heart and a cool head and practical common-sense were of much more importance than anything taught at school , '' and these characteristics were often displayed in most striking manner by the vol - unteers right at the start , a brief experience in warfare making them notably prominent .

		In discussions such as these , the volumes are strong ,
General Cox	ORGANIZATION	's special training and his student instincts lending much weight to his carefully worded opinions .

		There is a vein of quiet humor throughout , many of the anec - dotes and incidents of army life being related in a very interesting way .

		Even the apparently trivial may be of value , if correctly interpreted , as , for example , the shrill cry '' Glory to God '' from a woman spectator of the scenes in the
Ohio Senate	ORGANIZATION	when it was announced that
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	was being attacked . ''

		It was the voice of a radical friend of the slave , who after a lifetime of public agitation believed that only through blood could freedom be won . ''

		The last few chapters are given up to the move - ments against
Johnston	PERSON	by
Sherman	PERSON	's army , and the history of the end of the war in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	is presented in detail and in so satisfactory a way that these pages will be often consulted for this particular part of the story of the Civil War .

		HAZLITT 'S VENETIAN REPUBLIC .

		* Throughout a long lifetime , Mr.
W. Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	has been a devoted lover of
Venice	LOCATION	and things Venetian .

		At the age of twenty - three he formed the idea of writing a history of the island state , and his first sketch appeared in
1858	DATE	.

		This was revised and expanded
two years later	DATE	into a '' History of the Venetian Republic '' in four volumes , which , their author now tells us , '' undoubtedly left their precursors far behind in merit and completeness , but were still excessively far , looking at them to-day , from realizing what such a work ought to have been . ''

		In the forty years that have since elapsed , the author 's writings have dealt with other themes , but he has still read and accumu - * THE VENETIAN REPUBLIC : its Rise , its Growth , and its Fall , 421-1797 .

		By
W. Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 lated notes on
Venice	LOCATION	; and '' the fruit of a rather slow and tedious process of concentrat - ing on this particular object an endless amount of reading and thought is manifest in the work now submitted with diffident satisfaction to the English-speaking public , which may here meet with the means of instituting many comparisons between our own modern practices and opinions and those previously entertained and carried out at
Venice	LOCATION	, and may more thoroughly realize to what an extent the Republic was our pilot and our instructor . ''

		In its final form , the history fills two hand - somely printed volumes of eight hundred pages each , and constitutes the most ambitious at - tempt yet made to present the history of
Venice	LOCATION	to English readers .

		The narrative , which in the edition of
1860	DATE	stopped with the death of the
Doge Foscari	PERSON	in
1457	DATE	, is now brought down to the extinction of the republic in
1797	DATE	, while the account of political and social life which then occupied but two chapters now fills twenty-five .

		Substantially half of the present work is new , and has profited by the new material con - tained in the '' Calendar of
Venetian State Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' the later volumes of
Komanin	PERSON	's `` Storia Documentata , '' and various recent publications on Venetian antiquities .

		In the first volume , however , the indebtedness to recent investi - gations is very slight .

		This portion of the work has been to a considerable extent re - written , and the form of expression has been considerably improved ; but if the style is that of maturer years , the scholarship is stiH in all essential respects that of
1860	DATE	, and by no means the best of its day .

		The author seems to ap - preciate the importance of new information on the later period of Venetian history , for he speaks of the '' Calendar of State Papers '' as reducing '' to waste-paper the entire corpus of old-fashioned literature , produced from time to time in
Italy	LOCATION	itself and elsewhere , on the history and constitution of the Republic '' ; but he seems to be ignorant that the same kind of work has been going on , though less obtrusively , in the mediaeval field .

		If the amount of really new material on the earlier period is less abun - dant , it is at least considerable ; and the active investigations of the last forty years , especially in
Germany	LOCATION	, have thrown new light on almost every phase of the history of me - diaeval
Italy	LOCATION	and its relations with the other peoples of its time .

		Upon Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	this steady accumulation of special studies and monographs seems to have had no effect , as regards either his information or his methods .

		There is the same easy and haphazard use of chroniclers , the same lack of critical discern - ment .

		We find the same shadowy account of the beginnings of
Venice	LOCATION	, the same vagueness as to its relations to the
Eastern and Western Empires	ORGANIZATION	, the same absence of that sound knowledge of the general history of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	which is essential for a satisfactory treatment of so many-sided a theme .

		It is true that
Charlemagne	PERSON	is no longer called '' the French emperor , '' but it is a doubtful improve - ment to make the Venetians the descendants of '' the warlike Northmen '' -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- .

		The con - quests of the
Lombards	LOCATION	are still said to have been divided according to '' the prevailing sys - tem of feuds '' -LRB- p. 14 -RRB- .


Michaud	PERSON	and
Sismondi	PERSON	are still the chief authorities for the Crusades , and
Lebeau	PERSON	still does duty for the Byzantine empire , which is described in the cheap and easy fashion so common before its history began to be seriously studied .

		We read -LRB- p. 54 -RRB- of '' the sterile annals of the reign of the Doge Tradenigo , '' although it is now known that it was his policy which freed
Venice	LOCATION	from
Byzan	LOCATION	- tine control .

		Again and again , in Volume I. , one finds the survival of outgrown views and the reliance upon antiquated authorities .

		In the second volume the quality of the narrative improves .

		It is plain that the author is no longer struggling under the weight of an old book ; he has reached a fresh field , and writes with greater ease and freedom .

		His investigations are not thorough or exhaustive , but he gives a truer impression of modern
Venice	LOCATION	, and there is greater unity in style and treatment .

		Undoubtedly the most interesting chapters are the last , where , having conducted the republic through its declining days to its suppression by
Napoleon	PERSON	, the author enters upon an extended account of Venetian life .

		Everything is here canals and squares , churches and palaces , the constitution and the laws , industry and commerce , art and letters , food and drink and amusements , all that the traveller may wish to know of the life of the
Venice	LOCATION	of an older day is set forth in this gossippy compendium of Venetian lore .

		Very interesting it all is , but loose and ill - arranged and undigested .

		These chapters evidently represent the result of years of note-taking , but the mark of the scrapbook is still fresh upon them .

		After all , they are not history , nor since the sources from which the infor - mation is derived are usually left unnoted are they materials for history .

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, This defect , in greater or less degree , per - vades the whole work .

		Put together at different times out of all sorts of materials , it lacks unity and flow .

		The style is labored and heavy , with a tendency to inflated assertion , as when we are told that , '' There is no other spot on the earth where , within a radius of a hundred miles , or , if we limit the calculation to the metropolis itself , an infinitely smaller compass , so large a share of the world 's business has been directly or indirectly transacted . ''

		The fact is that Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	is neither a trained historian nor an attractive writer , and in mat - ter and manner his history falls below the standard of what one has a right to expect of so pretentious a publication .

		It contains a large amount of interesting material , but it lacks the literary qualities which might make it popular , while it does not show the extensive research , the familiarity with recent investiga - tions , and the critical judgment , which are essential to a scholarly work of reference .

		PARISH HISTORY EXTRAORDINARY .

		*
More than two years ago	DATE	, when the first vol - ume of the History of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, made its appearance and was briefly noticed in the columns of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, its value as a contribution to more than mere local , parochial , or denominational history was recog - nized , and a fuller notice was reserved until the work was farther advanced .

		The second volume is now before us , and a third is in course of preparation which is to bring the work down to the year
1862	DATE	, the beginning of the rectorate of the editor of the volumes .

		The history of an American parish which can be made to extend to three octavo volumes averaging more than four hundred pages each , without resorting to all sorts of '' padding , '' is altogether unique .

		But
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	is altogether unique among American parishes .

		It is one of the oldest corporations in the coun - try , existing under a charter dated
May 6 , 1697	DATE	.

		Its history proper goes back to
1674	DATE	, when the Province of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	was ceded to the British , for there were at that time a number of members of the Church of * A HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF TRINITY CHURCH , in the City of

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		England in
America	LOCATION	holding services in a little chapel near the Battery which had been pre - viously occupied by the
Hollanders	ORGANIZATION	.

		The year after the charter , the first church was opened for services upon a parcel of land obtained by royal grant '' in or near to a street without the North gate of the city , commonly called Broad - way , '' a site since occupied by two other struc - tures , one built in
1788	DATE	, and the other begun in
1839	DATE	, the present '' Old Trinity , '' as it is affectionately called by
New Yorkers	LOCATION	, and one of the finest specimens of Gothic architecture in this country .

		In
1705	DATE	the
Church	ORGANIZATION	became the possessor in fee simple of sixty-two acres of land on Man -
hattan Island	LOCATION	, extending along the
Hudson River	LOCATION	from Vesey Street to Christopher Street .

		It had formerly been the property of Aneke
Jans Bogardus	PERSON	, was sold after her death to Governor
Lovelace	PERSON	, and , as his property , had been confiscated by the crown in
1674	DATE	, hence it was sometimes called '' Queen
Anne	PERSON	's Farm . ''

		Since the Revolutionary War , as the city has grown and values have increased therein , this property has been the source of wealth to
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been the occasion of great responsibility as well , and it is the public - spirited manner , in the broadest use of the term , in which this great responsibility has been administered , that justifies in part the publication of this parish history upon its pres - ent gigantic scale .

		The benefactions of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	have been lavishly distributed for the establishment of churches , and for the succor of those already established in parts of the city where they were most needed .

		Naturally the possession of so much valuable property has caused Trinity parish to be re - garded as Naboth of old was in the possession of his vineyard .

		No one having a drop of Aneke Jans 's blood in his veins but felt that there was a possibility of establishing some sort of a claim to a participation in the income of the property that once was hers .

		Not a small portion of the volumes before us is de - voted to a refutation of the popular '' delusion '' that
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	is unlawfully possessed of and unjustly retains property belonging to someone else .

		But ever since
1705	DATE	,
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	has been administering her estates to the greater benefit of the community than the same estates would have yielded in the hands of private individuals .

		All of her revenue - producing property pays taxes -LRB- to the amount of
$ 63,000	MONEY	in
1885	DATE	-RRB- , and her property rev - enues -LRB- amounting in
1885	DATE	to a little less than
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 half a million -RRB- are expended for the religious , charitable , and educational advantage of the commonwealth , by maintaining the Christian religion , furnishing the means of a good edu - cation , comforting and succoring the sick , relieving the needy , cultivating the taste of the people by the refining influences of music , architecture , and beautiful worship , and thus promoting the best interests of society and contributing toward the security and perma - nence of our common civilization .

		The main - tenance of '' Old Trinity '' and her seven chapels with a communicant list of about seven thou - sand and a staff of clergy numbering twenty - five ; the maintenance of a system of parish schools , industrial schools , choir schools , and
Sunday	DATE	schools ; aid regularly given to eccle - siastical and educational institutions outside of the city ; the support of hospitals and infirm - aries , all these indicate the uses which Trin - ity
Church	ORGANIZATION	makes of her income , and faintly implies the potency of the Parish as a factor in the civic life of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Trinity has been the mother of churches in
New York City	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		Until recently , although without the name or the honor , she has stood in the position , done the work , and furnished the example , of the Cathedral of the Diocese of
New York	LOCATION	.

		After the close of the Revolutionary War and the organization of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in this country , Bishops Provoost ,
Moore	PERSON	, and
Hobart	LOCATION	were Rectors of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	while serving in succession as Bishops of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Bishops
Onderdonk	PERSON	and
Wainwright	PERSON	were assistant ministers of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	when elected to the Epis - copate of the same diocese .

		The Church has furnished from her staff of clergy bishops for other dioceses .

		The Rector of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	during the Revolutionary War was subsequently made Bishop of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		Nor are these all the reasons
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	has to offer for setting forth her history on such a gigantic scale .

		In the pre-Revolutionary and Revolutionary periods , covered in the first vol - ume , her history is the history of
New York	LOCATION	, both the city and the province , so that it is impossible to tell the one without also telling the other .

		How closely interwoven is
Trinity Parish	ORGANIZATION	with the early history of
New York City	LOCATION	may be seen by observing the street nomenclature of the lower part of the city .

		There are Church Street and a Chapel Street ; a Vesey and a
Barclay Street	ORGANIZATION	, named after Rectors of
Trinity	LOCATION	; while
Bayard	LOCATION	,
Chambers	ORGANIZATION	,
Charlton	LOCATION	,
Clarkson	PERSON	,
Delancey	LOCATION	,
Desbrosses	PERSON	,
Duane	PERSON	,
Harrison	PERSON	,
Howard	PERSON	,
Lispenard , Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Ludlow	ORGANIZATION	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Reade	LOCATION	, Varick , White , and
Willett	PERSON	Streets were named after men and families who were prominent in the history of the parish .

		The first volume does more than draw upon the commonly accepted authorities for a setting and background for the ecclesiastical narrative .

		The editor exhibits his independent character as a historian , and is able , in more than one instance , to correct errors which have been made and perpetuated in the history of the city and province .

		The second volume contains more that is of the nature of parochial annals than the first , and bears a closer relation to the history of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	which was at that time in process of organization in
America	LOCATION	.

		But like the first , it presents many excerpts from records and from local newspapers which give us an occasional insight into the customs and manners of the people in the American metropolis as it grew into importance in the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		It remains to be said that the books are published in a style to delight the eye of the bibliophile and are illustrated with photogra - vure portraits , fac-similes of important docu - ments , and views of the buildings which constitute
Trinity Parish	ORGANIZATION	.

Gama	PERSON	and
Columbus	LOCATION	and
Frobisher	PERSON	and
Raleigh	LOCATION	and
Clive	PERSON	and
Livingstone	PERSON	and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	are , after all , workers at the same gigantic task ; to show in luminous outline how that task has been wrought by many hands and in many climes until amid tumult and travail we may now see it approaching full realization , this is a task for one of the greatest historians of all the ages .

		Perhaps no one will be able to perform it until the twentieth century too is gone , and the whole can be understood in the light of the conclusion .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	has gathered much valuable material relating to modern colonies and their political and economic conditions .

		To be sure , these conditions are undergoing continual change , and facts and figures need incessant revision in order not to be misleading at any given time .

		Still , it is very convenient to find in one place such matter as may be found in these two volumes .

		Perhaps in so small com - pass it would be difficult to avoid treating some things in very general terms , as , for in - stance , in dealing with British
West Africa	LOCATION	-LRB- II .

		239 , ff -RRB- .

		One could perhaps wish that the narrative depended less on cyclopaedias -LRB- as evidenced inter alia by citations in footnotes , e. g , , pp. 245-54 -RRB- , and more on documents at first hand .

		The scholar of history , too , will hardly regard the historical treatment as satis - factory .

		The author is evidently more at home in dealing with descriptive analysis than in treating history .

		The bibliography is extensive , but of com - paratively little value because uncritical .

		A critical bibliography would in itself be an ex - cellent contribution to - scholarship on this most important subject .

		Such an undertaking would require a vast amount of labor and very deli - cate discrimination .

		But if it could be treated with the patient research and scholarly acumen which mark such a monumental work as Gross 's '' Bibliography of Mediaeval Municipalities , '' for instance , we should in time have at hand an indispensable guide for all students .

		The mass of literature dealing with colonial subjects is enormous .

		Official reports , correspondence , and acts of legislation , are of vast bulk .

		There are innumerable books of travel , of very differ - ent purposes and value many of them sadly padded .

		There are biographies and histories of all sorts , some mere ephemeral partisan effu - sions , some the hasty and superficial work of newspaper correspondents , some the serious productions of competent scholars .

		There are the discussions of many special subjects , geo - graphical , ethnological , economic .

		An enum - eration of some of these , such as is found in Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's book or in the '' Statesman 's Year Book , '' for example , is somewhat convenient .

		A critical compilation of all of them would be of incalculable value .

		In her summary , indeed , she admits his limi - tations and contradictions -LRB- p. 294 -RRB- : '' He was the greatest genius of his time , perhaps of all time ; yet he lacked the crown of greatness that high wisdom born of reflection and intro - spection which knows its own powers and limi - tations , and never abuses them ; that fine sense of proportion which holds the rights of others in the same solemn reverence it demands for its own . ''

		This is true ; but it is not shown by the story of his life as
Miss Tarbell	ORGANIZATION	tells it .

		A much more impartial estimate is the very interesting sketch of the
Empress Josephine	ORGANIZATION	, added as new material to the present edition .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	sums up , fairly and kindly , the defects and amiable qualities of the Creole girl who became for a while the virtual Empress of
Europe	LOCATION	, when she says -LRB- p. 452 -RRB- , '' A candid survey of her life destroys the heroine , but it leaves a woman who through a stormy life kept a kindly heart toward friend and enemy and who at last attained rectitude of conduct . ''

		The book is made useful as well as entertain - ing by a table of the
Bonaparte	PERSON	family , a chronological table , and a good index .

		BRIEFS ON : NEW BOOKS .

		Rear-Admiral
Evans	PERSON	, popularly known as Fighting
Bob	PERSON	, '' certainly The `` 8aiior ' t Log '' of Admiral Eran * .

		a plain , sailorlike way , in the neatly-made volume entitled `` A Sailor 's Log '' fAppleton -RRB- .

		The title of the book fairly indicates its quality both of style and matter .

		There is no attempt at fine writing , everything being set down substantially as it hap - pened , with business-like brevity , as if the narrator were drawing up an account of himself and his professional services for the information of his offi - cial superiors .

		There is plenty of life and color , however , and a good deal of rough humor seasoned occasionally with expressions of the forcible sort that at one time brought down upon '' Fighting Bob '' the publicly expressed disapproval of a sec - tion of the clergy .

		Certain critics of the present volume have been carping at the author for blowing his own trumpet therein somewhat loudly , and it must be owned he shows no disposition to deliber - ately make light of his adventures .

		And why should he ?

		A parade of modesty is almost as bad as braggadocio , and Rear-Admiral
Evans	PERSON	, a frank man if ever there was one , steers bis own normal course midway between these offensive extremes .

		He does not boast , nor does he angle for compli - ments with the old , old bait of self-depreciation .

		He tells his story as he remembers it , and if it is on tbe whole creditable to himself , well and good .

		Tbe book is cast in autobiographical form , and it begins at the beginning , namely , with the writer 's childhood in
Virginia	LOCATION	, where at six he was , as he pleasurabl y remembers , tbe proud owner of ' a gun , a pony , and a negro boy '' locally indispensable chattels , all three .

		In the opening chapters , life in old
Virginia	LOCATION	and an early trip to the West are pleasantly sketched , followed by an account of the author 's cadetehip at
Annapolis	LOCATION	.

		The main narra - tive begins with the account of the author 's services in the Civil War , and then follows tbe diversified story of cruises to the Orient , to
Africa	LOCATION	, to
South America	LOCATION	, to
Bebring Sea	LOCATION	, to the Baltic , and so on .

		An interesting episode tells of the Kiel celebration , which the author attended as commander of the cruiser ''
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The volume closes with a lively resum6 of the naval operations of the Spanish - American war .

		There are fourteen illustrations .

		Gilbert 1 * ** 8e ldom that we find a more of interesting and concise autobiograph - j cal 8 k etcn t h an The Stage Remi - niscences of Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book traces the life of a woman who has held a highly honored place in American theatrical history for over half a century ; the theatre-going public needs no introduction to that sterling actress and estimable woman , Mrs.
Anne Hartley Gilbert	PERSON	.

		For many years her friends have enjoyed listening to her de - lightful flow of reminiscence and anecdote ; it has been a real sorrow to many of them that so much of interest should live only in their memories , and they have often urged the writing of such a book as the one under consideration . ''

		But why ? ''

		she would invariably answer . ''

		I 've been so long be - fore the public that everybody knows all about me .

		Besides , I am not at all interesting , just by myself .

		I have always said that actresses and actors , who are good for anything , give the very best of them - selves to their audiences when on the stage .

		The private life doesn ' t count . ''

		But her friends ' ad - vice prevailed , and the book has been given us .

		From it we learn that Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	was born in
England	LOCATION	in
Rochdale	LOCATION	,
Lancashire	LOCATION	, not far from
Manchester	LOCATION	.

		She came to
America	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	, and always called herself a `` forty-niner . ''

		In
1869	DATE	she joined the theatrical forces of
Augnstin Daly	PERSON	, witb whom she was associated until his death in
1899	DATE	.

		The account of her first days in this country , which were spent in the West , then crude and wild , are sad and even pathetic .

		Her first stopping - place was
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, after a visit to a settlement on the edge of the wilderness , in which Mr.
Gilbert	PERSON	had invested and lost all their little fortune .

		They were glad to accept positions in a local theatre at an extremely low salary .

		In
1851	DATE	they went to
Chicago	LOCATION	, travelling in winter by open wagon , and obliged to bind themselves in blankets to keep from freezing .

		The hardships and the forgotten dramas 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of those pioneer days are a strong contrast to the later period of her life when the most palatial hotels were none too sumptuous .

		In these fascinating pages , Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	has given us peeps behind the scenes and glimpses into the personality of many famous persons in the annals of the American stage .

		The volume , edited by
Miss Charlotte M. Martin	PERSON	, is written with a straightforwardness , a propriety , good sense , grace and force of diction , which cause one to lay it aside with feelings of deep regret that it is not more lengthy .

		Many rare photographs , in the possession of the author and of Mr.
Evert Jan	PERSON	- sen
Wendell	PERSON	, have been appropriately utilized in the illustration .

		Two books resulting from the war
Between Great Britain	LOCATION	and her colo - nies and the two little Republics of
South Africa	LOCATION	have been published , dealing with incidental rather than historical aspects of the struggle .

		The first of these , '' Blue Shirt and Khaki '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is from the hand of Mr.
James F. J. Archibald	PERSON	, an American war correspondent who saw both the Cuban and South African campaigns .

		His recital makes a powerful appeal to our national vanity , chiefly by suppressing the disagreeable side of the Cuban campaign and the amazing imbecilities shown there , while bring - ing into strong relief the other amazing imbecilities manifested in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		There is undoubted justice in the strictures passed on the British army , the methods of which were far less suited to the campaign it had in hand than those of the Indian-fighting Americans ; but it is regrettable that so able a writer as Mr.
Archibald	PERSON	should fall into the ranks of those who conceive American greatness to be helped by the suppression of Ameri - can faults .

		The other book , `` War 's Brighter Side '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is edited by Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	, and consists chiefly of extracts from '' The Friend , '' a field newspaper published in
Bloemfontein	LOCATION	after the British occupancy , under the patronage of Gen - eral Lord
Roberts	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	,
Percival Landon	PERSON	,
H. A. Gwynne	PERSON	, and
Lord Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, the press censor , were most concerned with the publication , assisted by Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	and Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	, and contributions from all of these appear in the book .

		It seems to have been considered as very good fooling , of the British sort , likely to ex - asperate the enemy and dull the sensibilities of all to the realities of the work in hand .

		In a literary sense it is puerile .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's contributions , particularly , seem to fall below his standard .

		An epitome of the achievements of the century just past , in the various fields of pure science , is the aim of Dr.
Henry Smith Williams	PERSON	in his '' Story of Nine - teenth Century Science '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A field so vast and a subject so intricate might well demand an encyclopaedia for adequate treatment .

		The great battles of theory and experiment in which the errors of the past have given way to current The record of a
Century of Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		conceptions of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	, of matter , of energy , and of life , are depicted by the author with rare skill .

		A human interest is attached to the story by the effective introduction of glimpses of the per - sonalities of the great leaders in the century 's progress , and by the inclusion of more than four score portraits of scientific worthies .

		The earlier part of the story receives a symmetrical treatment , with just appreciation of men and their contribu - tions to knowledge ; but the closing years of the century , with their crowding discoveries , are passed over in silence or receive but passing notice .

		The historical perspective is perhaps insufficient to jus - tify any review of so recent a period .

		Still , it seems too bad to drop biology with
Darwin	PERSON	, and to make but incidental reference to the Rdntgen rays .

		No achievements of recent years have been more striking than those in the science of bacteriology ; but its results are here discussed only in their re - lation to scientific medicine , for our author is a disciple of the art of healing .

		This may also ex - plain the inclusion of the story of the rise of neu - rology , in the chapter on experimental psychology .

		But all this is only to quarrel with our author 's categories .

		The first chapter , on science at the beginning of the century , and the closing one on unsolved problems , bring home to the reader the wonderful progress which has been made , and also the infinity of the regions as yet unexplored .

		The whole range of the sciences is included in the plan of the work , and the author has been very success - ful in freeing his subjects from technicalities for the general reader , and very felicitous in clothing the changing theme with an unfailing charm .

		For many years Mr.
Alfred Russel NaturaUs	PERSON	?

		.

		Wallace has been a frequent con - tributor to periodical literature on themes scientific and otherwise .

		These scattered writings have been collected in two volumes of '' Studies Scientific and Social '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The essays have been revised , and in some cases greatly expanded by the introduction of copious illustrations .

		Many of them deal with the modern theory of Evolution and with the exposition and defence of one of its principal factors , Natural Selection , whose discovery the author shares with
Darwin	PERSON	.

		The problems of the distribution of plants , animals , and the races of mankind , of utility , of inheritance , of instinct , and of race progress , are discussed broadly and with the freedom from technical details de - sired by the general reader .

		The second volume is concerned with educational , political , social , and ethical topics , and includes several essays not before published , among which is a pointed reply to the article in which Mr.
Bradley Martin	PERSON	, Jr. , seeks to justify lavish expenditure by men of wealth .

		Several essays on the nationalization of land are added , as are also the two closing chapters which , under the captions of '' True Individuality '' and '' Justice not Charity , '' set forth our author 's well - known panaceas for social wrongs .

		The writings
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 here collected throw many interesting side-lights not only upon the progress of the natural sciences in the
last half century	DATE	, but especially upon the career of one of the notable coterie of men whom the controversy over Darwinism brought into promi - nence naturalist , explorer , evolutionist , social reformer , and spiritualist .

		Many of the essays were originally published in American reviews , and some of them treat of distinctively American topics , though whatever Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	might write is of interest in all lands .

		Mock heroics and travesties on clas - SSSS3U 8ical i ub J ects have dr pp ed 8 far from literary view in these days that Dr.
James A. Henshall	PERSON	's `` Ye Gods and Little Fishes , a Travesty on the Argonautic Expedition in Quest of the Golden Fleece '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- may be welcomed as affording considerable fun of a novel sort .

		The original itinerary of the Argo - nauts is followed with scrupulous care , but , as the '' Argument '' reads , the whole voyage is '' illumined by the search-light of the nineteenth century , '' of which the following lines may be taken as an example : '' Now Zetes , with some rods of brass , and reeds , And chariot wheels , made two velocipedes .

		With pedals on the front wheel , handle bar .

		And saddles made of shields ; they were by far The most astounding chariots ever seen Bicycles we would call them now , I ween .

		Thus ,
Zetes	PERSON	was the father of the bike ; His progeny to-day are not much like Their rude progenitors ; but as to speed Well , that 's another story , as you '11 read . ''

		The book is dedicated to another celebrity , who seems ancient even now , Admiral
George Dewey	PERSON	, with whom the author spent some pleasant days on Grecian shores long ago .

		It is elaborately designed and executed , with numerous embellishments .

		Essayton ^ r '
Frederick Storrs Turner	PERSON	pre - the theory of sents a volume to the philosophical public , with the title `` Knowledge , Belief , and Certitude '' and the sub-title '' An In - quiry , with Conclusions '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The con - clusions , we are told , will not surprise the reader more than they have surprised the writer .

		We also read : '' For the discovery of the conclusions reached by this inquiry , I am abundantly glad and thankful .

		So far as they are true and I have no doubt that they are true in the main they come from the only Source of all truth ; I am but the instrument through which they have been revealed . ''

		Such prefatorial remarks are unfair to critic and reader .

		They suggest a nawetS of philosophic experience which much of the further treatment bears out .

		And yet the candid critic , before he has turned the last leaf , is glad to record that he has found many worthy things cleverly said within its covers .

		However obvious the weaknesses of the work , its readability , freshness , earnestness , freedom from impedimenta , and general level of controversy , are much to be commended .

		Many of these qualities make it a book good for the hands of students approaching the theory of knowledge , which is in - deed the substantial problem of the work .

		The author runs rather far afield in the pursuit of his problem , and the conclusions are really not revolu - tionary nor breath-depriving .

		They are familiar in structure , and present no long-lost missing link of the evolution of knowledge .

		None the less they are suggestive , have a sufficiently original manner of approach , and are of interest to other thinkers .

		The work is on the whole a commendable one , though somewhat weak in its historical perspective , and rendered weaker by the author 's unfortunate preface .

		A recent addition to the series of '' Beacon Biographies '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the life of
Louis Agassiz	LOCATION	by
Alice Bache Gould	ORGANIZATION	.

		The little volume is full not only of the facts of the great scientist 's life , but also of the great and lovable spirit of the man .

		Something of the noble optimism and the high enthusiasm that was so great a part of his power as a teacher finds a place in the pages and gives them vitality .

		The author writes with evident delight on the many-sided nature of her subject , and this pleasure finds expression in a wealth of stories that bring the great investigator 's simple and sweet devotion to the aims of his life very near to us .

		While the volume lays stress more particu - larly upon the personal side of the life , it makes as full a showing of the scientific ideals that controlled
Agassiz	PERSON	, and of the things that he accomplished , as the ordinary reader will care for .

		Further , the author has written with such sparkling clearness , and with such entertaining charm of style , that the book might well be pleasant reading for anyone .

		story . ''

		Five Years of My Life -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a little belated perhaps , and will scarcely win the attention it would have attracted had it followed closer on the heels of the Rennes trial .

		The famous ' Affaire '' is now matter of history , and the public mind is fully made up on its merits .

		It is well , however , to hear the victim 's last word in the matter , and what he has to say is of considerable interest .

		The pith of the book lies in the author 's diary of his Devil 's
Island	LOCATION	experiences , and the tale he tells is assuredly a harrowing one .

		Other chapters sketch the author 's life , and recount the various stages of the '' Affaire , '' from the arrest of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	to the close of the Rennes court martial .

		The author ends by declaring that he proposes to go on striving for a full reparation of the judicial error '' of which he is the victim .

June 1	DATE	, auspicious an opening with
Miss Lynch	ORGANIZATION	's sprightly book on
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's sketch lacks some - thing of the vivacity of its predecessor , but its tone is more impersonal and its general conclusions seem more carefully weighed .

		It opens with a thought - ful survey of German imperial questions and con - ditions , and thence passes to the consideration of specific topics Social Divisions , the '' Arbeiter , '' Rural Life ,
Military Service	ORGANIZATION	, Pastimes , The Ber - liner , the Press , etc. .

		The treatment is at once descriptive and critical , and the author is evidently well informed .

		The illustrations are pleasing and well chosen .

		Mr.
Barry Pain	PERSON	's '' Another English - h woman 's Love-Letters '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a rather clever parody on the popu - lar book which its title clearly points to , and the question as to the genuineness of which Mr.
Pain	PERSON	answers decidedly in the negative in his preface .

		He adds : '' It is difficult to imagine that anybody would have the treacherous impudicity to publish the love-letters of a woman recently dead , without even a plea of historical interest . ''

		We don ' t know about that .

		Another outcome of the love-letter craze -LRB- now , we trust -RRB- on the wane -RRB- is the dainty , vellum-bound , ribbon-tied booklet containing '' An Englishman 's Love-Letters '' -LRB-
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This author also is `` in merry pin , '' and makes an honest effort to be amusing .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We now have three or four excellent school histories of the
United States	LOCATION	, prepared for the use of the upper classes of secondary schools .

		Among them there is none better than the work of the late
Alexander Johnston	PERSON	, which has long been held in high esteem .

		In its present form , the earlier revision by Mr.
W. M. Daniels	PERSON	has been supplemented by a still later revision at the hands of Dr.
William MacDonald	PERSON	, and the result is a work that may be confidently commended as one of the best of its class .

		It seems to be supplied with every sort of helpful adjunct that the teacher could wish .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The attractively made volume entitled '' Faneuil Hall and Faneuil-Hall Market , '' by Mr.
Abram English Brown	PERSON	, tells the story of those two famous
Boston	LOCATION	edi - fices and their founders , and goes in some detail into the historical events , local and general , with which their names are interwoven .

		The book is soberly writ - ten and informing , and is the fruit of painstaking re - search .

		It is appropriately illustrated .

		-LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		We have come to expect work of a very scholarly type from the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	series of '' Studies in Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the latest addition to this series maintains the standard set by its predecessors .

		It is a study , by Mr.
Henry Osborn Taylor	PERSON	, of '' The Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages , '' and bridges over the transition period between
the Classical and Mediaeval	ORGANIZATION	epochs in a philosophical manner .

		The centuries from the fourth to the seventh take up the greater part of the discussion .

		Boethius , the
Fathers	ORGANIZATION	, Monasticism , the Corpus
Juris	PERSON	, and early Christian poetry and art , are among the subjects treated .

		The style of the essay is admirable , and scholars will be thankful for the appen - dix of bibliographical notes . ''

		The World 's Work '' is so young a magazine that a bound volume comes to our table as a sort of surprise , for we had hardly realized that six numbers were already in existence .

		It makes a valuable record of contemporary industrial and political activity , and the illustrations , as its monthly readers know , are of excep - tional beauty and interest .

		The work of the world is taken in a rather narrow sense by the editor of this magazine , and we could wish that its materialism were more nearly counterbalanced by its idealism .

		A
Treasury of Irish Poetry	ORGANIZATION	in the English Tongue , '' edited by Messrs.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	and
T. W. Rol	PERSON	- leston , is a publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The method of the work is that of Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's '' English Poets , '' comprising a general editorial introduction , and signed critical notices of each of the poets included .

		Of these there are over one hundred , ranging from
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	, and
Father Prout	PERSON	, through the poets of '' The Nation , '' down to such very modern writers as `` A. E. , '' Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, Mr.
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Tynan-Hinkson	PERSON	.

		The work is an extremely well-edited and exhaustive anthology , and no one can examine it , even casually , without feeling a deepened respect for the Irish contribution to the wealth of English poetry .

		Dr.
Albrecht Wirth	PERSON	is the author of an important study in political science entitled `` Volkstum und Weltmacht in der Geschichte '' -LRB-
Munich	LOCATION	:
Bruckmann	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a work of the most vital interest for our age of race-conflicts and rivalries for the attainment of world - power .

		The author is well fitted , both by study and travel , to discuss these great problems in the philosoph - ical spirit , and his synthetic grasp of his subject is re - markable .

		The style of the work is clear and forcible to a degree uncommon among German scholars , and the mechanical features of the book are attractive and dignified .

		We have received Volumes XIII .

		and XIV .

		of the ''
Cornell Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Classical Philology . ''

		The first of these monographs is a study of '' The Subjunctive Sub - stantive Clauses in Plautus not Including Indirect Questions , '' by Mr.
Charles L. Durham	PERSON	.

		The second title requires a long preliminary breath to be taken .

		It reads : `` A Study in Case Rivalry , being an Investi - gation Regarding the use of the Genetive and the Ac - cusative in
Latin	LOCATION	with Verbs of Remembering and Forgetting . ''

		The work bears the name of Mr.
Clinton L. Babcock	PERSON	as its author .

		Publication 45 of the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	is '' A Synopsis of the Mammals of
North America	LOCATION	and the Adjacent States , '' prepared by Mr.
Daniel Giraud Elliot	PERSON	.

		It is a work of 471 pages , handsomely printed and abundantly illustrated .

		Its tendency is to be catholic in the recognition of species , but the writer sounds a note of warning on the subject of their multi - plication , and is strongly convinced that a more critical examination will greatly reduce the number in the near future .

		The half-tone plates , mostly of crania , illus - trate almost every genus and subgenus now recognized among our
North American Mammalia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is of the highest scientific value , and does great credit to the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	which has made possible the series of publications to which it belongs .

		It is full of brilliant bits , clever epigrams , flashing analysis , and displays withal a broad grasp upon the meaning of things as they stood related to events and to history in those dark years of the nation 's travail .

		It is not too much to say that it is the best novel founded on the Civil War period that has yet been published . ''

		406 THE UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		It seems only yesterday that we were ex - tending the right hand of fellowship to the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and congratulating our city upon so notable an acquisition to the agen - cies that stand for its higher life .

		But it seems that ten full years have rolled by , after all , for the
University	ORGANIZATION	is now engaged in the celebra - tion of its first decennial .

		As university cele - brations go , a ten-year period does not count for much .

		We think of such European fes - tivities as have been witnessed of recent years in
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and
Bologna	LOCATION	, of such American anniversaries as the quarter-millennial of Har - vard , the sesquincentennial of
Princeton	LOCATION	, and the approaching bicentennial of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chicago will doubtless have affairs like these in due time , but none of us will live to participate in them , and we can hardly be expected to forego the modest opportunities that lie within our reach .

		This is a community of large under - takings and rapid developments , and who that has breathed its ozonized air will be daring enough to suggest that a decade of
Chicago	LOCATION	is not the equivalent of one or more cycles of Cathay ?

		Besides , our
University	ORGANIZATION	has acquired a certain degree of antiquity by the simple process of taking up the abandoned dignities and responsibilities of the old
Chicago	LOCATION	Uni - versity .

		In adopting as its own all of the earlier institution that there was left to adopt , it has come into possession of a fine collection of gray-bearded alumni , and of a respectable historical tradition which reaches back to the period of the Civil War .

		Those who remember the defunct institution thus restored to a ghostly sort of life will be impressed by the contrast between the con - ditions of the sixties and the conditions of the nineties .

		The beggar 's wallet has been replaced by the purse of Fortunatus , and results are now achieved with little seeming effort that were beyond the wildest dreaming of a gene - ration ago .

		Contrast , for example , with the magnificent and rapidly-multiplying group of buildings which are the present visible sign of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, the single building of the sixties , waiting long years in vain for 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, the means to build the modest wing that was needed to round out the symmetry of the orig - inal plan .

		Contrast , again , with the long faculty-roll of to-day the small band of scholars who gave life to the institution of yesterday ; with to-day 's great museums and libraries , yesterday 's unpretentious cabinets and book - shelves ; contrast even with the imposing as - tronomical establishment of the present the famous old observatory which was the chief material boast and pride of the past .

		Contrast , also , with the figure of the prosperous President of the new
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, whose chief care is merely to make the best use of the stream of wealth that pours into his lap , whose chief occupation is to devise new plans that shall outrun the resources so generously pro- vided , contrast with this figure that of the devoted head of the old
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, who for years carried on a hopeless struggle to keep the institution alive , who heroically fought the monster of debt and bore up under the discouragement of public apathy , who gave to the school the whole of his energy and the whole of his private means , and who for his reward was compelled to see the mortgages foreclosed , the personal property put up for sale in ignominious ways , and the building itself razed to the ground .

		In our rejoicing at the success of the new institution , it is well that we give a thought to the old one , if only for the chastening influence of a view of the contrasting conditions .

		During the ten years of its existence ,
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has gained an assured place among the foremost institutions for higher education in this country .

		To accomplish such a result both money and intelligent direction were needed , and in neither has the
University	ORGANIZATION	been lacking .

		In the matter of its endowment and property holdings , it stands among the half-dozen wealthiest institutions of learning in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Its faculty , while notice - ably uneven with respect to the several depart - ments , probably numbers altogether as large a proportion of highly-distinguished scholars as is to be found in any university on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		It has outlived the probationary period , and stands to-day as a recognized influ - ence for the promotion of the highest ideals of scholarship .

		The fears which its well-wishers entertained at the start lest it should develope into a sectarian institution have been dissipated , and the gibes of earlier years at '' the Baptist school on the Midway '' have ceased to have any possible significance .

		Not only has the spirit of its teaching been free from any sec - tarian taint , but it has also been free from every other form of social or caste restraint upon the exercise of unhampered investigation .

		The newspaper agitation of a few years ago , accusing the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities of interfer - ing with the freedom of teaching , was so easily shown to have been prompted by either malice or ignorance that no person capable of intelli - gent judgment is likely again to support such a charge .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	has from the begin - ning encouraged original research , and the contributions of its faculty to the advancement of science have been considerable in many de - partments , such , for example , as those of physics , physiology , economics , sociology , an - thropology , and classical philology .

		The pub - lications of members of the faculty during the ten years make an imposing showing , and we may mention the fact that they include , in addition to work of a strictly scholarly type , a considerable amount of work in imaginative literature .

		In the ranks of this faculty there have already been developed one of the most remarkable of our younger novelists and one of the most inspired of our younger poets .

		If asked for a statement of the leading idea for which this
University	ORGANIZATION	has stood , the answer would have to be that it has represented the idea of educational experimentation more dis - tinctly than any other institution .

		Now experi - mentation means innovation , for one thing , and an expenditure of tentative effort , for another .

		Conservative minds view these things with suspicion , and they no doubt have to pay a certain penalty .

		Innovations are not always wise , and tentative effort is , in its very nature , something not quite sure of its aim .

		But the openness of outlook to which these things lead is so desirable a thing to gain that a certain amount of misapplied energy , and even of direct waste , is not too heavy a price to pay for it .

		On the whole , we should say that the experi - mental policy of this
University	ORGANIZATION	has been jus - tified by the results .

		A good many interesting ideas , both in administration and in education proper , have been developed , and enough of them have proved worth developing to com - pensate for the uncertainties and the failures that are the inevitable occasional concomitants of such a policy .

		To the community in which it is placed ,
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has proved itself a bene - ficent influence .

		If it has not leavened the whole lump , it has at least done something to restore the balance from the side of passion
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 and materialism toward the side of reason and idealism .

		All of our good social and intellec - tual causes find in it a helpful ally , and it is exerting a growing influence with every added year of its existence .

		As it continues to broaden and deepen in its own work , we may safely be - lieve that the community of which it is a part will feel at least the indirect effects of its development , and will share in the uplifting influence of its manifold activities .

		We are thankful for its help during the decade now ended ; we shall expect it to do even more for us during the decade now beginning .

		TRIUMPH OF THE `` LITERARY PL A Y. '' At the
Grand Opera House	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, a recent inci - dent delightful in itself and significant in dramatic annals drew the largest audiences of the season , although the rates were raised for the time .

		Three presentations were given of
Browning	PERSON	's '' In a Balcony , '' preceded by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's '' The Land of Heart 's Desire . ''

		The project originated with Mrs.
Sarah Cowell Le Moyne	PERSON	, who played the '' Queen '' in the
Brown	PERSON	- ing piece for which she wisely chose Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	as ''
Norbert	PERSON	'' and Miss
Eleanor Robson	PERSON	as ''
Constance	PERSON	. ''

		The cast in the companion piece was also arranged by Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	, who devised the staging of both productions in all details , in - cluding costumes , properties , and histrionic chia - roscuro , which is as indispensable to a play as to a picture , an efficient fusion of energy , inertia , and color , mental and physical .

		The light and shade of a drama demands obedience to the canons of sculpture , painting , and poetry , as well as to those of acting , and is psychologic as well as mechanical .

		For the latter division of the composition , electri - cians , carpenters , and confederates accompanied the players over a route which extended from the At - lantic to the head of the lakes and through the middle West , everywhere received by large and cordial audiences , who set approval on an under - taking springing from a woman 's devotion to liter - ature and belief in the stage and in her country , an undertaking requiring a manager with faith in literature upon the stage and in the talents of all engaged for its living interpretation .

		To Mrs.
Katberine Tynan Hinkson	PERSON	I am in - debted for the personal acquaintance of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	.

		Pale , slender , just entering then on manhood , he seemed , in his lustrous dark eyes , modest demeanor , sincerity , earnestness , and uncon - scious air of abstraction , what a man must be who wrought in journalism for bread of the body , and for necessity of his soul wrote poetry as a luxury .

		His father painted portraits for luxury , and sup - ported his family in a cozy and hospitable suburban
London	LOCATION	home by sketching for the illustrated journals .

		The family had removed from
Dublin	LOCATION	, like many Celts who had preceded them , for the opportunity denied them in their native land , Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	had known from child - hood the Gaelic lore whose scope and depth have been at last apprehended throughout scholardom , and whose resources many are now diffusing .

		* At
Hildesheim	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, one sees a clambering rose-tree on a lofty cathedral wall .

		The record is unquestioned and unbroken showing that its roots are deep in the ground for a thousand years .

		Its roses are of every
summer	DATE	, white and sweet .

		Its tendrils twine about column and cornice , and its petals fall upon mediaeval graves in the churchyard .

		Thus the roots of this long obscured Gaelic litera - ture send their sap up to the heights of the present day , and the roses are now for witness of mankind to its beauty and purity .

		In the oldest songs and stories there is often , as in the Greek , the Latin , and the
Norse	ORGANIZATION	, something offensive to taste ; there are occasionally theories , suggestions , implications repugnant to the highest ideals .

		In old Gaelic the roses have thorns , as roses must ; but , so far as disclosure goes , they lack worms as roses should .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's play has for its predominant per - sonage a type of the imaginary creation between the human and the spiritual the fairy .

		The human heroine is a bride , discontented because her husband is off all day in the fields and she is nagged by his mother 's tongue .

		The bridegroom 's father balances with amiability his wife 's sourness .

		The village priest figures symbolically in the play , strain - ing probability , for belief in the fairy can scarcely survive seminary dialectic .

		The poet 's purpose re - quires that the Christian minister shall remove the crucifix from the wall to soothe the elfin temper it dis - tracts ; thus teaching that even to gentle sympathies ethical truth should not be sacrificed .

		The fairy insidiously absorbs the soul of the bride , symbolically warning humanity against succumbing to unhappi - ness instead of seeking to overcome its causes and to ennoble those who may contribute to it .

		The inci - dental music , by
Julian Edwards	PERSON	, was racy of the soil .

		All the story was compacted into a single scene .

		Its interest was breathless , its execution exquisite . ''

		The Land of Heart 's Desire '' is written in un - jingled verse , filling forty pages , small octavo .

		Prior to its publication , Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	had been known chiefly , but not exclusively , by lyrics .

		It is difficult * Irish Gaelic ,
Scotch Gaelic	ORGANIZATION	, which is also known as
Gaelic	ORGANIZATION	in the stricter sense , and Manx -LRB- spoken in the Isle of Man -RRB- , form the Gaelic division .

		All three of these are still living .

		The first two languages seem hardly to have differed from each other in the ninth century .

		The oldest monuments are the old Gaelic inscriptions -LRB- Ogham is the native name for the Gaelic runes -RRB- , which possibly date as far hack as about 500 A. D .

		The literary record of Irish begins in the eighth century , at first with glosses , and then from the year
1100	DATE	onward we have many extensive manuscripts which contain Sagas .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, to be a Dubliner and not dramatic .

		The
Dublin	LOCATION	stage has a fame unbounded by its insular frontier .

		Great actors have been known to prefer an audience of
Dublin	LOCATION	gamins to aristocracy and the blood royal .

		There
Sarah Ward	PERSON	studied while her parents pursued the craft she bequeathed to her illustrious daughter ,
Sarah Siddons	PERSON	.

		There were seen probably the greatest trio ever together on any stage a
Garrick	PERSON	, a
Barry	LOCATION	, and a
Sheridan	PERSON	in a single cast .

		Thither , balked on the continent , baffled in
London	LOCATION	,
Handel	PERSON	went , seeking not in vain an opportunity to produce for the first time the greatest of oratorios , the '' Messiah . ''

		Notwithstanding the vigor of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's first play , it required a sagacity born of both intuition and experience to stage it .

		However fascinating to the imagination , to visualize a production of which the intangible is an indispensable living element might well make a manager pause .

		Wholly free from meretriciousness , the illusion was complete .

		The mystic power which answered on the `` good people 's '' night the illicit prayer of the discontented bride was deliciously suggested in the green coat and red cap , the curling locks , the limpid voice , the sprite-like dance , the uncanny laughter , the weird song , and the witching eyes of a girl of fourteen , who played with volatility and rare insight .

		* There was an absence of seeming incongruity be - tween the ethereal and the human participants in the tragedy .

		The lines which room may not be taken to quote open up wide vista in many direc - tions .

		The bride said to the priest : '' Father , I am right weary of four tongues : A tongue that is too crafty and too wise , A tongue that is too godly and too grave , A tongue that is more bitter than the tide , And a kind tongue too full of drowsy love , Of drowsy love and my captivity . ''

		The fairy replied : '' But I can lead you , newly married bride , Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue , And where kind tongues bring no captivity , For we are only true to the far lights , We follow singing , over valley and hill . ''

		It was the '' far lights '' that allured the typical woman of the play .

		It was not strange that Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	, who re - ceived from
Robert Browning	PERSON	himself , after repeated hearings , an authoritative commission to interpret his works as a reader , should have conceived the plan of putting one of the poems on the boards .

		To the ordinary vision , '' In a Balcony '' would appear unavailable because the entire theatrical vehicle would have to be invented .

		There are The cast of `` The Land of Heart 's Desire '' may be noted : Father
Hart	PERSON	, the Priest of
Kilmacowen Harold Russell Shawn Bruin Frank Connor Maurteen Bruin Oscar Eagle Bridget Bruin	PERSON	,
Maurteen Bruin	PERSON	's wife
Ada Dwyer Maire Bruin	PERSON	,
Shawn Bruin	PERSON	's wife
Nora O'Brien	PERSON	A Faery Child
Mabel Taliaferro	PERSON	The SCENE is laid in the
Barony of Kilmacowen	ORGANIZATION	in the County of
Sligo	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and the time is the end of the eighteenth century .

		The CHARACTERS are supposed to speak in
Gaelic	LOCATION	.

		twenty-eight pages of long speeches and nothing else .

		As every inch of a scene must be almost math - ematically defined to its specific end , and as there is nothing defined in the poem but three fugitive sketches with no '' acting version , '' the stage man - agement had to assume the substance of casuistry .

		Long speeches are the terror alike of players and observers .

		But not a line was cut , except one to reconcile the embodiment of the queen with a personality too young to make up for the age attrib - uted in the text .

		There were several departures , however , from the text as originally printed , alter - ations made by
Robert Browning	PERSON	after Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	had read the poem to him .

		From the pene - trative shading of her tones his ear detected dis - sonances which had escaped his eye .

		Neither play would make a '' bill '' alone .

		It is fundamental in art that association shall be by con - trast or by harmony , thus verifying the truth that art is unity in variety .

		In the combination made by Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	, both principles are exemplified .

		Contrast is potent between the splendor of an antique Italian palace and the squalor of a peasant cottage ; between the grandiose in architecture and embel - lishment , the magnificent in costumes -LRB- magnificent they were -RRB- , and tropical gardens , on the one hand , and the barrenness of a rustic kitchen on the other .

		Harmony was eloquent in the identity of the motive of the two plays : '' That every inordinate cup is unbless 'd . ''

		The queen yearned unlawfully for the love of `` Nor - bert . ''

		The bride wished for an unwarranted release .

		Contrast appears again in the method of conse - quences .

		Force ends the lives , presumably , of the conspirators who , to compass their mutual object , had shamed and tricked their benefactress .

		An unearthly spell consumes the life of the bride , dis - loyal to her troth in a wish for its annulment .

		The culminating episode in which '' Constance '' and `` Norbert '' are discovered by the queen in their true relationship proved a marvellous exhibi - tion of inarticulate acting by Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	, acting which can not properly be called pantomime , although inarticulate .

		It was necessary to accept for the queen , whom , in a naturally regal bearing , Mrs. Le Moyne admirably represented -LRB- the question of age aside -RRB- , monarchic humiliation , and , still more abasingly , affront to womanly delicacy .

		There are great actresses who , to simulate frenzy , have been seen to pluck the hair from the head of a sofa ; to escape tearing a passion to tatters , to tear a hand - kerchief .

		To indicate rage without words , gyratory gesture has served , with a wild physiognomy .

		Per - plexity or indifference has shrugged shoulders ; cunning has lifted eyebrows , and languor or confu - sion dropped them .

		Defiance has been known to dislocate garments or the ringlets of a wig .

		Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	wore her own brown hair , and , with ideal queenly composure , disturbed neither that nor any other material thing on the stage .

		Not only silent but almost motionless throughout the long final collo -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 quy , each is her artistic vitality that , resting against the balustrade for seemingly needed physical sap - port for the distraught Queen , '' the acting of the mind , graphic through the lines of her tormentors , permeated the atmosphere .

		The audience saw , or heard , a despair , a fury , a supreme agony and sov - ereign determination transmitted from the brain to the face by that indefinable power which only a few of the greatest players have been able to employ inarticulately and convincingly .

		The effect was due in a measure to Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	's noble render - ing of the queen 's previous long speeches : for true reading '' is utterance of another 's words as if the thought were conceived at that moment in the mind of the speaker and spoken for the first time .

		So complete was Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	's antecedent identification of herself with the queen , by voice , deportment , and action , that the confessions and betrayal in the lines of the lovers were apparently anticipated in the eyes , the face , and the subtle flexibility of the queen 's figure , which never lost grace and scarcely seemed to lose fixedness .

		We have been assured that '' There ' a no art To find the mind 's construction in the face . ''

		Shakespeare had not seen a face of such mobility as Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	's .

		Half the house would prob - ably have affirmed during that scene that the queen was speaking .

		It has been mechanically demonstrated by
Rous	PERSON	- selot that sounds may be produced and the normal ear fail in the closest proximity to catch them .

		The ear of the spirit is daintier .

		It hears sounds shaped only on the lips of the spirit .

		There are three kinds of speech accent .

		Linguis - tics note two , namely , accent of stress and accent of pitch .

		There is a third , the accent of silence .

		In highly phonetized languages for example , the Sanskrit suspension of voice is an essential of expression .

		It corresponds in vocal rhythm to the '' rest '' in music , which was '' invented to give a necessary relief to the voice and a sweetness to the melody . ''

		Modern science corroborates
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, that articulate speech differentiates the human race from other species .

		Treatises have been written to show that certain muscles are given to man solely that he may reveal his feelings to others .

		* With - out vocalization , without bringing to the sense of the audience evidence of muscular effort , Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	in that episode accomplished more exhaust - ively than by words the poet 's purpose , when , with faltering , almost falling step , she at last passed in silence between the lovers , off the stage , leaving in her wake a terrible expectancy of swift vengeance . ''

		When the vocal chords come together in rhyth - mical vibration , '' writes
Brugmann	PERSON	, `` a musical clang arises which is called voice .

		All sounds which are spoken with voice are called voiced , and those without voice , voiceless . ''

		The portion of '' In a Balcony '' which was on this occasion voiceless was the clear - * Darwin : Life and Letter * .

		est of its speech .

		It was a singular illustration of subjective as distinguished from the simultaneous and excellent objective acting of Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	and
Miss Bobson	LOCATION	.

		It rounded a symmetrical imperso - nation of one of
Browning	PERSON	's most impracticable characters .

		That
Browning	PERSON	is a familiar poet in American homes can no longer be doubted ; for only that familiarity can explain , in part at least , the quality of the audiences assembled all over the country to enjoy this programme of which the junior author is necessarily in only the beginning of an assured career .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has published several other volumes , prose and verse , and the play ''
Countess Kathleen	PERSON	. ''

		`` Strictly speaking , '' writes Mr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	-LRB- '' English Dramatic Literature , '' Vol .

		, dramatic literature is that form of literary compo - sition which accommodates itself to the demands of an art whose method is imitation in the way of action . ''

		That the action may be more of the mind and less of the body , yet the imitation be vital , was established in the production of these two poems .

		The victory of mind over matter in the first was the artistic incorporation of the incorporeal .

		That was due in equal measures to the poet , the stage direction , and the performers .

		An adroit mutation of relative values in the
Browning	PERSON	poem transferred the sympathy of the audience from the hapless young lovers to the discredited queen , a mutation wrought by Mrs.
Le Moyne	PERSON	's adroit recall of the character from an old to a seemingly only middle-aged woman , with an exaltation , a pathos , and a power which were irresistible .

		A financial result commensurate with the aesthetic charm of an undertaking now an achievement dem - onstrates that the American stage is ripe for the literary play adequately presented .

		IT is impossible , upon this occasion , to do more than chronicle the death of Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, which took place at
Hampstead	LOCATION	, on the ninth of
Jane	PERSON	, after an ill - ness of several weeks ' duration .

		He was in his sixty - fifth year , and , to judge from his recent work , in the full tide of his literary activities .

		Those activities are not to be properly measured by thinking of him in his character as a popular novelist .

		His fiction , although the work by which he was most widely known , is the work that will be soonest forgotten .

		Bat the world will not quickly forget him in his character as the champion of the rights of authorship , as the philanthro - pist of the
People 's Palace	ORGANIZATION	, as the historian of
London	LOCATION	, as the student of early French literature , as the worker for the Palestine Exploration Fund , and as the bio - grapher of
Edward Palmer	PERSON	.

		In a word , his achieve - ments outside the domain of fiction were so varied and so important that the novels might be left out of the reckoning without serious loss to his reputation among the well-informed .

		A friend of all good causes , and an ar - dent worker in their behalf , his death leaves the world appreciably poorer , and he will be mourned far and wide .

		PENNYPACKER 'S LIFE or GENERAL ,
MEADE	PERSON	.

		* It is hardly too much to say that Mr.
Isaac R. Pennypacker	PERSON	's Life of General
George G. Meade	PERSON	is the most important single study bear - ing on the Civil War .

		The book covers the cen - tral operations of that war , describes its climax in the culminating battle , and details the long - drawn-out but inevitable final scenes .

		More than this , it presents a new view of the chief figures of that struggle , and draws from the background , where contemporary intrigues and injustice had thrust him , the finest spirit and ablest soldier of the war .

		If there is a deity who presides over contemporary fame , he must be thoroughly used by this time to posterity 's rude reversals of his general verdicts .

		He puffs his cheeks , he clamors , he hustles , he howls on his hired claque , he confuses the judgments of men by their passions , he distributes his crowns and laurels .

		And then , suddenly , his day is done , '' the tumult and the shouting die , '' his wreaths are discovered to be mainly of the deciduous kind , and the true heroes , or their ghosts , step out to receive their delayed reward .

		The vast mass of our war literature is , in the main , the work of interested actors in the struggle .

		It is valuable material for a writer who can make allowance for the fact that every man carries the centre of the visible horizon in his own head .

		But the publication of the Offi - cial
War Records	ORGANIZATION	has at last given to historians the uncolored facts of the campaigns .

		Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	has based his study on these rec - ords .

		He has collated them with patient mi - nuteness ; he has left no point uninvestigated ; he has even taken horse and ridden over the whole region of the operations he has described .

		The result is a combination of truth of detail and grasp of ensemble and directness of plain speech which is real history .

		He has brought clearness out of a weltering confusion and his deductions can only be traversed by some - one who will take similar pains and find equal facts to back him .

		The scheme of Mr.
Penny	PERSON	- packer 's book seems to be , in brief , to show the movements of the whole army and
Meade	PERSON	's relations to them ; to focus all the evidence available , official and personal , in the narra - tive ; to give the plans and purposes of the * LiFB OF GENERAL
GEORGE G. MEADE	PERSON	.

		commanders , and then to describe the actual manoauvres and collisions as they occurred .

		The main difference between the North and the South in the conduct of the war was in the concentration of authority .

		Lee was in com - mand on his side .

		He could appoint his corps commanders and plan and fight his campaigns without much interference .


Jefferson Davis	PERSON	was often at the front , but he did not carry a metaphorical guillotine with him .

		On the other side there was war by committee : the Presi - dent , the Cabinet , Senators , Representatives , and newspaper editors , were all strategists , and between them they hanged the successive Generals of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac , '' in order to encourage the others . ''

		General
Meade	PERSON	learned the art of war under such cir - cumstances , and had experience of all the be - wildering changes .

		As a brigadier at
Charles City Cross Roads	ORGANIZATION	,
Meade	PERSON	, by a personal exploration at night , saved a large part of McClellau 's army , which had taken the wrong road , from marching straight into the jaws of the enemy .

		Still under
McClellan	PERSON	, he was the chief factor at
South Mountain	LOCATION	, and his capture of that strong - hold by assault compelled
Lee	PERSON	's abandonment of his plan of campaign and the concentration behind
Antietam Creek	LOCATION	.

		At
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, under
Burnside	PERSON	, by one of the most brilliant charges of the war , he cut Lee 's line , and if supported would have won a victory .

		This charge , in daring and measure of success , com - pares most favorably with that of
Pickett	PERSON	's at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, for it was over longer and more difficult ground , it penetrated farther into the enemy 's position , it captured a number of flags and prisoners , and had a greater percentage of killed and wounded .

		At
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	the peremptory orders of
Hooker	ORGANIZATION	held
Meade	PERSON	in comparative inactivity .

		Had he been permitted to use his corps as he desired , the fate of the battle would probably have been different .

		As it was , the other officers , realizing
Hooker	PERSON	's incapacity , looked to
Meade	PERSON	to lead them .

		Reynolds sent a message '' Tell General
Meade	PERSON	that someone should be waked up to command this army . ''

		The Government seems to have reached the same conclusion ; for on the
morning	TIME	of
June 28 , 1863	DATE	,
Meade	PERSON	was aroused from sleep by the arrival of peremp - tory orders for him to take command of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		The battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	is the central jewel in
America	LOCATION	's war crown .

		It was nobly fought on both sides , but
Lee	PERSON	was undoubtedly over -
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 matched in tactics .

		In the first place , his line was twice the length of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's , yet so well were the latter 's forces disposed that
Lee	PERSON	had no advantage of overlapping .

		In the second place , the sending of Longstreet , on the
third day	DATE	, against what was practically
Meade	PERSON	's whole army in position , was a grievous error .

		Lee 's successes on the first and second day , in fact , really solidified the
Union	ORGANIZATION	lines .

		Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	clears up a mass of controversy regarding this battle .

		Credits have been claimed for
Hancock	PERSON	and
Warren	PERSON	and
Sickles	PERSON	to such an extent as to almost leave
Meade	PERSON	barren laurels ; but Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	cites record upon record and witness after witness to show that
Meade	PERSON	was the directing and in - spiring mind throughout .

		In a few days he had gathered together his widely - scattered corps ; he directed the march and concentra - tion ; by his personal efforts on the second day he saved the
Union	ORGANIZATION	left , imperilled by
Sickles	PERSON	's error ; and he provided for and anticipated the attack on the centre on the third day .

		Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	also disposes , finally it is hoped , of the clamor against
Meade	PERSON	for not crushing Lee after the defeat .

		The North underesti - mated the power of the South before the war , at every crisis during the war , and yet after the war .

		One would think the terrible effec - tiveness of the Southern troops in defense came out clearly enough the next year .

		Outnum - bered twice or thrice ,
Lee	PERSON	yet baffled and checked the
Union	LOCATION	commanders , and was only overwhelmed at last by sheer weight of men .

		Meade had no superiority of numbers after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	to make an end of Lee in his almost impregnable position .

		As soon as possible he did move , and by skilful manoeuvres drove Lee across the Rapidan and gave his government time to summon up its forces and resources for the final struggle .

		If the combatants had only known it , the war was ended at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		The rest was but the dragging of Hector 's corpse around the walls of Troy .

		The South had no longer a chance to win .

		Yet the most deadly struggle of the war ensued .

		Those final tragic scenes remind one of the gloomy ending of the Nieb - elungenlied , where in the
Hall of Etzel	ORGANIZATION	the Huns and the Burgundians fall together until all are gone .

		Splendid valor was displayed on either side , yet in a military point of view the fighting was certainly bad .

		Of what there was creditable , a great deal was due to
Meade	PERSON	, though superseded in command by
Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was
Meade	PERSON	, not
Grant	PERSON	, who ordered and opened the Battle of the Wilderness ; it was
Meade	PERSON	's
Sixth Corps	ORGANIZATION	, not
Sheridan	PERSON	's cavalry , which cut the Confederate lines at
Petersburg	LOCATION	; and at the very end of all , it rested upon
Meade	PERSON	's decision to capture
Lee	PERSON	and the remnant of his troops rather than let them surrender to
Grant	LOCATION	.

		Probably it is by his facts and opinions in this part of his book that Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	will arouse the most controversy .

		He deals with Grant in a generous spirit , but hardly conceals his opinion that
Meade	PERSON	would have finished the work better alone .

		His most startling statements are in regard to
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Again and again , by the records , the latter is proved to have been insubordinate , careless , even incompetent .

		He seems to have always wanted the centre of the stage with the lime - light turned upon him .

		He seems to have con - ceived of war as a grand , gigantic spree , in which he need have no concern for others .

		Grant 's infatuation with him gave him all the opportunity he wanted .

		He was allowed to form the cavalry of the army into a separate command , and wander off into space seeking fights which were interesting in themselves but of no great value to the main objects of the campaign .

		He left
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's flanks undefended , failed to collect information , and generally neglected the duties usually assigned to a cav - alry commander .

		Grant 's support of him was of course indorsed by public opinion , for the public has little knowledge of the grave mat - ters of strategy , tactics , and supply , and has a genuine appreciation for a commanding officer who rises up in his stirrups and waves his sword above his head .

		Mr.
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	, it may be noted , appears in Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	's book in the somewhat unenviable light of Informer-in-Chief .

		What was
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's reward ?

		England made
Marlborough	LOCATION	a duke , and gave him the im - perial domain and palace of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	, for less vital services .


Wellington	LOCATION	was advanced to a dukedom for his work in the Peninsular War , and his whole monetary reward was about four
millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		After
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Meade	PERSON	, who was a Major in the
Engineer Corps	ORGANIZATION	, was raised to the rank of Brigadier General in the
Regular Army	ORGANIZATION	the same reward conferred upon Funston for the trapping of Aguinaldo .


Meade	PERSON	was passed over for
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, passed over for
Sherman	PERSON	, passed over for
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		That he felt his wrongs deeply , there can be no doubt ; but he did not sulk in his tent and he did not go about complaining .

		After the war he gave his native city the benefit of his taste 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, and skill in the laying out of its beautiful park .

		Brasidas , the Spartan General , is the central figure of the history of the Peloponnesian War .

		He goes up and down
Greece	LOCATION	, fighting battles , quelling revolts , redressing grievances .

		Where - ever anything is wrong , he is sure to turn up .

		Meanwhile nobody pays much attention to
Brasidas	LOCATION	, and Thucydides does not waste a word of his golden style in describing his per - sonality .

		Finally ,
Brasidas	PERSON	dies , and his his - torian permits himself a single sentence `` Brasidas lived and died in the practice of every virtue . ''

		Meade somehow recalls the modest , unostentatious Greek hero .

		He too was always on hand at every crisis , to do the right thing and retrieve the errors of others .

		And if his present biographer does not quite equal Thu - cydides in his triumph of taciturnity , he at least does not indulge in any blare of trumpets over his hero .

		He is brief in his personal ref - erences .

		He gives us a glimpse of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	awakened at night to take command of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac at its most critical hour ; another of his riding into the gap between
Sickles	PERSON	and the main line at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, ready to charge at the head of a few officers and orderlies to stay the oncoming rush of the Confederate troops ; and in his final paragraph he thus sums up , as a logical deduction from his whole story , the services of Meade : '' In the history of the wars of the
United States	LOCATION	, it does not appear that the nation ever profited by the services of any other army commander who combined thorough training with personal energy and skill on the battlefield as did Gen - eral
Meade	PERSON	. ''

		That is a great verdict , and unless the whole structure of Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	's book can be overthrown , it is a true one .

		AN HISTORIAN OF IDEAS .

		* Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	is an incomparable his - torian of ideas .

		His superb rationality and fair-mindedness give to his work in this kind a quality of finality and convincingness unat - tainable by more showy but less judicial writers .

		His services to English literature are generally acknowledged .

		But there is little recognition , on the part of professional students of philoso - phy , of the fact that his '' Science of Ethics '' is not only the best but the only logically cohe - rent presentation of the so-called Spencerian or * THK ENGLISH UTILITARIANS .

Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		Evolutionary ethics .

		And nobody seems to have noticed that in his crushing reply to
Huxley	LOCATION	's Romanes lecture he fairly unseated in the open lists that redoubtable champion of controversy , the overthrower of dukes , bishops , and prime ministers .

		In response to a reviewer who had sharply taken him to task for his estimate of Buckle , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	modestly says that he himself could no more have written Buckle 's book than he could have encountered him at chess .

		It may be so .

		But Buckle 's book , for all his brilliance and masterly marshalling of facts , is full of things that are not so crotchets , fantastic hypotheses unverified and un verifiable , hasty generalizations and pseudo-scientific laws ; while , humanly speaking , it will not be easy to find anything affirmed in the volumes of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	that is not substantially as he declares it to be .

		And this preeminent sanity is , after all , as rare a quality in literature as brilliancy , if not as genius .

		We shall quite as soon find another Buckle , another Macaulay , or even another
Carlyle	PERSON	, as a literary man who , writing voluminously on a wide range of con - troverted ethical , critical , and philosophical questions , never permits himself an ignoratio elenchi , a flight of irrelevant rhetoric , an unfair use of ambiguous terms , or a misrepresentation of his opponent 's thought , but always endeavors to bring out the aspect of truth aimed at by the doctrine or formula which he is controvert - ing , and who invariably qualifies the positive - ness of his assertions in exact proportion to the available evidence .

		These qualities revealed in Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's `` English Thought in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' published in
1876	DATE	, are now more maturely dis - played in a sequel to that work , just published , entitled `` The English Utilitarians . ''

		The title does not quite do justice to the contents . ''

		The English Utilitarians '' suggests mainly , if not exclusively , the utilitarian theory of ethics and legislation .

		But in addition to this , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has given us a history and criti - cism of the classical political economy , a close study of the associationist psychology in its relation to the Scottish philosophy of
Reid	PERSON	,
Stuart	PERSON	, and
Hamilton	PERSON	, and a brief but extremely instructive sketch of the religious thought of
the first half of the century	DATE	.

		The work is not only broader , but more in - teresting , than the promise of its title . ''

		Utili - tarianism , '' exclaims
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' surely a pedant invented the word ; and oh , what pedants have been at work employing it . ''

		But

		THE DIAL 397 Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	, though he aims at the enlighten - ment rather than the mere entertainment of his readers , possesses himself a sense of humor , and is keenly alive to the lack of it in his heroes . ''

		Austin , '' he quietly observes , in ex - planation of the failure of the Lectures on Jurisprudence , '' thought it a duty to be as dry as
Bentham	PERSON	, and discharged the duty scrupu - lously . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	can not accomplish the impossible .

		He can not enliven
Bentham	PERSON	, of whom
Hazlitt	PERSON	said , '' He writes a language of his own that darkens knowledge . ''

		He can not make Malthas and Ricardo and Mill on Ham - ilton amusing to frivolous readers .

		But the present work has this advantage over its pre - decessor : that the leading ideas of which it treats still possess more than a merely historical interest .

		There is no such hopelessly arid and barren tract to be traversed as the exhaustive survey of the futile Deist controversy in the earlier work .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has himself been a disciple of the doctrine which he interprets .

		He has lived through and assimilated the modi - fications which evolution , the new psychology , and the new erudition have necessitated in our apprehension of it .

		And his judicial and lucid exposition of all this enlists the thoughtful reader 's attention and holds it to the end .

		These considerations enter especially into the review and estimate of the life-work of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, which occupies the larger part of the third volume , and which no other living writer , with the possible exception of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, was so well qualified to execute . ''

		What was there to find so mysteriously sig - nificant in
Goethe	LOCATION	, or in
John Mill	PERSON	so full of weight ? ''

		cries Professor
James	PERSON	, lamenting the lost illusions of his youth .

		So it ever is .

		The new psychology and the new rhetoric can make nothing of the facts and the logic of yes - terday in their old-fashioned psychological garb .

		But however it may be in physics , in the mental and moral sciences there are a great many facts and relations which persist sub - stantially unaltered by new fashions in psychol - ogy .

		And there are a great many distinctions , classifications , and groupings , which conform to the experience and apprehensions of normal humanity , and so retain their validity , even after evolution has taught us the vanity of '' natural kinds , '' and the new sociology has made us shy of dogmatizing about so complex a growth as the actual social structure .

		The logic , the political economy , and the review of
Hamilton	PERSON	represent the highest development of rational thought about human conduct and the problems of philosophy in the
England	LOCATION
of fifty years ago	DATE	.

		They require many qualifications to-day , a surprising number of which , however , were parenthetically anticipated , though not emphasized , by Mill himself .

		We are suffi - ciently aware of their limitations , and there is nothing to be learned from vague a priori de - preciation of them from repeating that Mal - thus has been refuted by the
McCormick	PERSON	reaper , that the wage-fund is an illusion and the economic man is a fiction , or from point - ing out again that Mill was imperfectly ac - quainted with
Kant	PERSON	, that he failed to anticipate evolution , and that he `` opened a trap-door under the Utilitarian ethics '' by admitting qualitative differences in pleasures .

		Those who fancy that they have outgrown Mill should re-read the essay on
Bentham	PERSON	, that on
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , that on the Conflict in
America	LOCATION	, and ask themselves where they can find to-day such wide and completely assimilated knowledge combined with such lucidity and precision of statement , so wfell defined and systematically applied a philosophy united with such sympa - thetic insight into the views of an opponent , such keen political sagacity accompanied by so strong an enthusiasm for humanity .

		The time for destructive criticism of Mill is past .

		The helpful thing would be , assuming the essential rationality of his point of view , to show just what modifications he himself would probably have made in his doctrines and formulas if he could have lived to share the wider outlook of our generation .

		It is precisely this that Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	does , and does the more admirably because , as he repeatedly observes , he is not a specialist , is not greatly erudite in any of Mill 's chief fields of thought unless it be in the theory of ethics .

		A professional economist would have taken us beyond our depth into the bog of the wage-fund and Malthusian contro - versies .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	clearly presents the real points at issue , and is careful not to carry the analysis beyond the point at which logomachy begins .

		Few specialists in logic or psychology would have possessed the self-restraint required to present , disengaged from all technical detail , the true significance of Mill 's four methods and his doctrine of natural kinds ; and a ''
Kant	PERSON	philologist '' would have fairly wallowed in the slough of misconceptions offered by the Mill -
Hamilton	PERSON	controversy : whereas Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	is content to mark the obvious limits of Mill 's and
Hamilton	PERSON	's knowledge of
Kant	PERSON	, and to set forth lucidly the parts of
Kant	PERSON	's doctrine that are relevant to the discussion .

		Hamilton him - 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, self is treated with greater severity and with less historical objectivity , perhaps , than any other writer discussed in these volumes .

		But the bub - ble of
Hamilton	LOCATION	's reputation still needed prick - ing , and the work is here done neatly and finally .

		The book , however , is by no means wholly devoted to these austere themes .

		The first half of Volume I. is occupied by a masterly introductory survey , social , political , economic , and literary , of English society at the close of the eighteenth century .

		The biographical sketches are executed with a skill that shows the practised hand of the editor of the
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	.

		And though Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	aims at lucidity and precision of style rather than picturesqueness , he not in - frequently carries precision and lucidity to the point where they have the effect of epigram .

		`` Truisms , '' he tells us , `` are required so long as self-contradictory propositions are accepted . '' ''

		The doctrine of Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	has been so often lucidly expounded that it is hard to say what it means . ''

		`` What Kant precisely meant , or whether he had not various and in - consistent meanings , is happily a question beyond my purpose . ''

		Sociologists and psychol - ogists may meditate upon the following : '' It is common enough to attempt to create a science by inventing technical terminology . ''

		To meta - physicians we may commend the definition that `` a philosophy is a poetry stated in terms of logic . ''

		Some theologians may be interested in the allusion to those who infer that '' opinions are confirmed because a non-natural interpre - tation can be forced upon them . ''

		The social - settlement young woman will have many searchings of heart when she reads that '' it might almost seem that he -LSB-
Bentham	PERSON	-RSB- rather valued the benevolent end because it gave em - ployment to his faculties , than valued the em - ployment because it led to the end . ''

		All system-mongers should incorporate the follow - ing in their system of logic : '' If a system will work , the minutest details can be exhibited .

		Therefore , it is inferred , an exhibition of mi - nute detail proves that it will work . ''

		Lastly , we would inscribe in letters of gold in the faculty-room of every educational body that legislates for the ingenious youth of
America	LOCATION	these words of wisdom : '' He seems to fall into the error , too common among legislative theo - rists , of assuming that an institution will be worked for the ends of the contriver , instead of asking to what ends it may be distorted by the ingenuity of all who can turn it to account for their own purposes .

SHOREY	PERSON	.

		THE OLD
NEW YORK	LOCATION	FRONTIER .

		* From a time immemorial before the coming of the white man ,
Central New York	LOCATION	was in possession of the Iroquois , a confederation of five Indian nations , to which was joined , in the year
1715	DATE	, a Southern tribe , the Tuscaroras , who were driven from
South Carolina	LOCATION	by the English settlers .

		Thus was constituted what was afterward known as the famous Six Na - tions .

		They numbered about 12,000 , and long before any contact with the whites had taken place they were in a semi-civilized condition , and became the most powerful of the Indian races on the continent , their sway extending west as far as the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and south to the confines of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		They had a representative form of government , a national council , and , strange to say , their women were permitted to hold meetings and were often consulted in matters of importance .

		One of the names of the Six Nations meant in English the
United People	ORGANIZATION	.

		They lived in cabins built of wood , and cultivated large fields of tobacco , corn , and other vegetables ; they were skilful in various kinds of handiwork , and built forts palisaded with logs , which were proof against the white man 's fire-arms .

		The leadership of the Six Nations was , shortly after the outbreak of our Eevolutionary War , assigned by common consent and acclaim to
Joseph Brant	PERSON	, known as the
Great Captain	ORGANIZATION	, a distinction to which his birth as an Indian sachem , his military genius , and his command - ing and masterful personality fully entitled him .

		Then but little over thirty years of age ,
Brant	PERSON	, fitly characterized as '' the most remark - able Indian known to history , '' was prepared to enter upon that career which has written his name indelibly upon many a blood-stained page in the annals of
New York State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Waver - ing for a time as to which side he should take in the conflict between the mother-country and the colonies , his sense of loyalty to the King finally prevailed , a result to which a visit made just then to
England	LOCATION	, his cordial reception there , and his presentation at Court , no doubt largely contributed .

		The traits native to his race had in
Brant	LOCATION	been tempered by the mild - ness of his disposition and his Christian nur - ture in one of the missionary schools ; and the charges made against him during his lifetime , and repeated carelessly by writers since his THE OLD

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1901 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 399 day , of needless brutality and ferocity in the Indian and Tory raids upon the defenceless border settlements , have been found on inves - tigation to be for the most part without foun - dation .

		By reason of its central position among the American colonies , the people of
New York	LOCATION	took a conspicuous part in the long and bloody strife maintained with such stubborn resistance and unflinching valor , within and upon its borders , in the French and Indian Wars and during the Revolution .

		The Old Frontier of
New York	LOCATION	was that established by the treaty of
Fort Stanwix	LOCATION	, made by Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	with the Iroquois in
1768	DATE	.

		It conveyed to the English not only large parts of
New York	LOCATION	, but parts also of
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
West Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The amount paid in money for this imperial domain was something over
$ 50,000	MONEY	.

		That section of this historic line lying within
New York State	LOCATION	extended from
Fort Stanwix	LOCATION	, near
Oneida Lake	LOCATION	, in a nearly straight course and a southerly direction to the head-waters of the
Delaware	LOCATION	.

		The beautiful region known as the
Susque	LOCATION	- hanna Valley was visited by a few adventurous Dutchmen from
Albany	LOCATION	in the prosecution of their business as fur-traders , as early as
1614	DATE	, several years before the arrival of the Pilgrims at
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		These were followed not long after by a number of Jesuit priests , who had penetrated the wilderness , coming from
New France	LOCATION	, with the view of converting the savages .

		Early in
the eighteenth century	DATE	there was a large influx of Palatines from
Germany	LOCATION	on their way to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, many of them , how - ever , stopping in the
Valley	LOCATION	and becoming permanent residents there .

		At about the same time there arrived a company of Church of
England	LOCATION	men , sent out to propagate the Gospel in the
New World	LOCATION	, and some Non-conformist ministers from
New England	LOCATION	, who built chapels and established schools , in one of which
Joseph Brant	PERSON	was educated .

		This missionary feature of our colonization is one to which hitherto little importance has been attached by histo - rians ; indeed , very little has been known of it .

		Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has , in the present work , given to it much deserved prominence .

		The Palatines settled upon lands in the Mo - hawk and
Schoharie Valleys	LOCATION	, where they con - stituted the bulk of the white population ; while the Scotch-Irish , coming over in great numbers from about
1720	DATE	-LRB- some 30,000 , it is stated , crossing the
Atlantic	LOCATION	within two years -RRB- , planted themselves along the upper waters of the
Susquehanna	LOCATION	.

		From this stock came some of the most distinguished of the Revolutionary Generals ,
Henry Knox	PERSON	,
John Stark	PERSON	, An - thony W r ayne , and the Clintons . ''

		It was the men in these frontier communities ,
Palatine	LOCATION	, Scotch-Irish , and Dutch , '' says Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	, that '' bore the shock of war when the conflict with
England	LOCATION	began .

		It was they who became patriots to a man ; it was the houses and crops of these which were burned ; it was they who were murdered or made prisoners . ''

		Of these men , the Scotch-Irish were perhaps the greatest sufferers .

		Living as they were at the outpost of civilization , in towns sparsely settled and remote from other settlements , and with little hope of relief from any of
Washington	LOCATION	's forces , dependent entirely upon their own untrained militia , '' it was upon them that the Indians and their Tory allies in the Border Wars were the first to fall , and it was their lands alone that became entirely depopulated . ''

		When peace was established , in
1783	DATE	, many of those who had survived the massacres of
Cobleskill	LOCATION	,
Springfield	LOCATION	, German Flatts , and
Cherry Valley	ORGANIZATION	, returned to their old homes in the
Mohawk	LOCATION	and Schoharie Valleys ; while emigrants from
New England	LOCATION	came in numbers to the lands about the upper
Susquehanna	LOCATION	, from which the Scotch-Irish ,
Palatine	LOCATION	, and other pioneers had been driven , virtually dominating from that time Central and
Western New York	LOCATION	.

		This border warfare has invested that entire region with as much romance and legend and tradition as ever existed on the Scottish border , and forming quite as good material for song and story .

		The wonder is that so little use of this material has been made ; for , save for some county histories , some historical monographs , like
W. L. Stone	PERSON	's admirable Life of
Joseph Brant	PERSON	, for example , and a number of unim - portant works of fiction , only gleanings from this rich field have as yet been made .

		One reason for this is that many of the chronicles of that period , published early in this past cen - tury , have long been out of print , and that a store of precious papers , letters , diaries , etc. , has been lying in
State	LOCATION	archives , and in libra - ries , public and private , much of it until re - cently inaccessible , or reposing undisturbed owing to the languid interest felt in its subject - matter .

		The story of the tragedies enacted in the
Susquehanna	LOCATION	and
Mohawk Valleys	ORGANIZATION	during the Revolution and of the frightful sufferings and privations of the people , almost unexampled in the annals of Indian warfare , has now for the 400
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 16	DATE	, first time been consecutively told .

		Born and reared in the region which he describes , the author of this work has had good opportunities for becoming familiar with its localities and traditions , as well as for gaining access to documentary material , and he has availed him - self of these opportunities with rare judgment and discretion , and in the true historic spirit .

		His difficulty seems to have been that of selec - tion ; and the one regret awaiting the reader of these fascinating pages is that the writer felt compelled to compress into one volume what might have been readily and justifiably expanded into two or more .

		Of such signifi - cance were the events transpiring in that for - mative period in our
Empire State	ORGANIZATION	, and so many were the personages of more or less dis - tinction who took part in them , that the space to which Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has modestly confined himself is scarcely adequate for their effective setting forth .

		He is entitled to great praise for the completion of this illuminating record , on such broad and comprehensive lines and in such vivid colors , of those '' Old , forgotten , far-off things And battles long ago , '' the issues of which , in the successive stages of its civilization , have been so momentous to the people of
New York	LOCATION	, but the memory of which had well-nigh perished from the minds of this generation .

		The text of the work is enriched by portraits of
Joseph Brant	PERSON	and of Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	, maps of the Old Frontier and of the early patents , and a complete bibliography .

		make their appeal to the universal reason which is operative in each man , and which carries with it principles of right and justice .

		It is inevitable that they should seek to apply these transcendental prin - ciples to social institutions .

		Thus , the starting-point of Mr.
Willoughby	PERSON	's treatise on '' Social Justice '' is in the initial sen - tence : '' Ideals of right constitute the essentially active principles in our social and political life . ''

		But abstract ideas can not be applied directly to an unknown situation . ''

		What is right or wrong for us as members of a society can be determined only after we have ascertained all the circumstances which have led to a given state of affairs , as well as the conditions by which a given line of conduct is to be influenced in the future .

		This will mean that at least a certain amount of study of actual social conditions is imperative upon everyone , and especially upon those who would seek to teach or guide others .

		The study of the social sciences will thus be shown to be , as it were , a propaedeutic to the science of right living . ''

		There is a much easier and more direct path to subjective certainty , the way of deduction from one 's own preferences , class prejudices , inherited beliefs and instincts , or popular ideas .

		But subjective certainty , while very enjoy - able , is not communicable and transferable , and can not be made the basis of scientific investigation or of associated action in a self-governing commu - nity .

		A multitude of vociferating orators , all shout - ing their subjective certainties at once in full cry , simply drown each other 's sentences .

		Reason is social , and it renders its verdicts only to those who patiently consider all factors .

		It is in this spirit we are asked to consider justice , equality , property , distributive justice , the right of coercion , the ethics of competition and punishment . ''

		All we can say all that any ethical teacber can say is that , in each instance where an act is required , one must examine it as to all its possible results , proximate and ultimate , objective and subjective , and then ask himself whether the given line of conduct is more calculated than any other possible line of conduct to advance the world toward the realization of the highest ethical perfection . ''

		If this programme is carried out we shall find that the pseudo-science called '' Social Ethics '' will become a practical sociology based on induction , and no longer a series of vague deductions from assumed premises .

		For emphasizing this conclusion , the author of '' Social Justice '' deserves praise .

		THE DIAL 401 cial Problem , '' brings into the camp of the socio - logists his criticism against economics , or , rather , against the claim of political economy to furnish society with principles for guidance in conduct .

		He writes with a serious purpose and with remark - able power .

		At times he seems to be carrying us bodily over to Socialism , for he regards it as nec - essary to social progress that all monopolistic en - terprises be taken over by city , commonwealth , or nation .

		But he stops short of Marxism , and proves that there will still remain large room for private capital and individual enterprise in the occupations which have an artistic element and can not be served by machinery on a large scale .

		With increasing taste and wealth there will be an enlarged demand for articles made to order , and on these monopoly can not lay its hands .

		The abuses of parasitic wealth are described in terms which remind us of
Veblen	PERSON	's `` Theory of the Leisure Classes , '' while the misery of penury is painted in vivid contrast with luxury paid for from unearned income .

		The paradox of the '' glut '' is traced to this cause .

		Millions are ready to work and buy at the moment when the '' captains of industry '' confess their in - ability to keep factories open on account of '' over - production . ''

		The purchasing power is in the hands of those who already have excessive wealth , and the others can not furnish custom for the merchants .

		The remedy proposed by Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	is to turn the unearned income into the public treasury by social - izing monopolistic industries .

		When wealth is diffused there will be no lack of purchasers and consumers .

		Yet there is real danger of over - population .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	admits the current teaching , and faces the consequences as
Plato	PERSON	did .

		He frankly says that if people are paid '' according to their needs '' they may multiply more rapidly than their wants can be met .

		Legal restrictions on marriage will become necessary .

		Our school-teachers will find a theme for a quarrel in the author 's reaction - ary statement that government schools can not lead in the most inventive and original methods .

		Free schools can render a good service by giving the elements of instruction in a mechanical way , but can not equal private schools in trying useful experi - ments in method .

		It is useless to attempt in brief space a criticism of this thought-provoking and stimulating book .

		It will arouse opposition , but it will give the most hostile readers food for reflection .

		If people were as quickly moved by reason as by immediate interests , or even if the business world read books at all , this volume would win a place in the libraries of men of affairs .

		Passing to the thick volume on Temperance Re - form , by Mr.
Ronntree	PERSON	and Mr.
Sherwell	PERSON	, we dis - cover the influence of the idea that a rational rule of conduct can be discovered only by an induction of all the factors which bear on the subject , causa - tive and regulative .

		We confront the appalling results of the use of intoxicants upon health , eco - nomic well-being , education , and political integrity .

		Then the various methods of reducing the evils are carefully and fully presented , prohibitory legisla - tion , local option , high license , government spirit monopoly , the dispensary system , the
Gothenburg	LOCATION	method , and finally an estimate of the relative place and value of all these methods .

		While some sources of information in relation to this country seem to have been overlooked , the work will be found a convenient manual , sane , conservative , and persuasive . ''


Josiah Flynt	PERSON	'' has succeeded in making urban police authorities very angry with him , and his descriptions of the alliance of the Upper and Under Worlds , as given in his '' Notes of an Itinerant Policeman '' and '' The Powers that Prey , '' are not pleasant reading to those who value serenity of mind above public security and purity .

		While there is a tendency to strong and vivid statement , the stories of this expert tramp are too minute and circumstantial to ignore .

		Occasional revelations of investigating committees , reporters , and grand juries tend to confirm the impression that there is very much truth in the charge that many of those who are paid by a heavily-taxed society to protect it are in the habit of adding to their income by levying assessments on criminals .

		Those citizens who indulge the fancy that all goes well without zealous and vigilant effort may be startled from their moral somnolence by these vigorous and pic - turesque sketches .

		Two local studies of the Jewish population of
London	LOCATION	, by Mr.
C. Russell	PERSON	and Mr.
H. S. Lewis	PERSON	, are of interest in several American cities , because the immigration of Jews from
Russia	LOCATION	has aggravated our municipal difficulties , at least temporarily , to a very serious degree .

		It is not easy for people of different race and religious education to cooperate economically and politically until the process of spiritual assimilation has made considerable ad - vance .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	does not agree with Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	in all his conclusions , and it must for some time remain an open question whether the Jewish popu - lation can ever learn to draw near to the religions life of other peoples .

		But it seems to be clear that in a tolerant community they can thrive without disturbing the economic progress of the earlier oc - cupants of the territory , since the Jews are eager to rise in pecuniary power and social consideration , and they will not passively accept a low standard of life if by any means they can improve their lot .

		Count Tolstoy pours out a wide if somewhat thin stream of pathetic description and emotional appeal on behalf of some vague scheme of reversion to agricultural life , in his book entitled '' The Slavery of Our Times . ''

		A student of social reform can not help sympathizing with the Russian 's moral earnest - ness and boundless pity for those who suffer .

		But the gross misrepresentation of classic economics , the reactionary ideals , the utterly visionary pro- gramme , become very wearisome after one has read several volumes of these harangues .

		If the public could only take the good Count as an artist , and ignore him as an economist , he might do good ; 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, but his fascination as a story-teller confuses the intellect and puts the critical faculty off its guard .

		The only antidote for illogical and untrue repre - sentations by economists is a careful study of their strongest works .

		But it is a good deal easier to read tirades and gloomy word-pictures than to fol - low scientific processes , and so we must expect to learn that '' The Slavery of Our Times '' will be placed on the shelf with
Adam Smith	PERSON	and
Francis Walker	PERSON	in many libraries , and be read while the masters of the science are honored by title .

		But facts and science will , after all , have their way , and fiction will take its proper place as a stimulant .

		Meantime , the plea for universal peace deserves a hearing on its own account , and no hater of hateful war can wish Count Tolstoy to be silent on that subject , even if his artistic temperament prevents him from being exact on any subject .

		The author of '' Commerce and Christianity '' assumes that Socialism has made out its case : that the sole business of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is to provide a pulpit for its doctrines and a ritual for its praise : and that the future existence of all ecclesiastical organi - zations depends on their becoming teachers of eco - nomics of this particular type .

		What would remain for religious institutions to do if Socialism were adopted this year , the author seems not to have considered .

		A very attractive and appetizing programme is suggested by the title `` Our Nation 's Need ; or , Let us all Divide Up and Start Even . ''

		Those who desire to read what a very amiable person has to say on Communism may thank us for calling at - tention by this brief note to the little volume .

		In '' Restraint of Trade '' Mr.
Harper	PERSON	has col - lected and arranged in convenient form a great many opinions on the subject of trusts .

		Critical treatment is not to be expected in a compilation , and there is here no attempt at an organic connec - tion of the material ; yet in spite of this fact the book will be found for some purposes quite conven - ient for reference .

		The modern tendency to make the church as useful as possible in ministering to human needs is illustrated by the brief monograph prepared for the
Department of Social Economy	ORGANIZATION	at the
Paris	LOCATION	Expo - sition of
1890	DATE	.

		While it is by no means exhaustive in its treatment of '' Religious Movements for Social Betterment , '' the illustrations selected are taken from some of the most important efforts of the kind , and their significance in the history of
Chris	PERSON	- tian civilization is intelligently interpreted .


CHARLES R. HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		THE fourth
International Publishers ' Congress	ORGANIZATION	has been in session at Leipsic during the past week .

		The only American representative in attendance was Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	.

		Among the English delegates were Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	,
Frederick Macmillan	PERSON	,
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	, and
William Heinemann	PERSON	.

		A number of im - portant papers were read and discussed .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The Reformer Heroes of the Reformation '' of German series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- we now have a new life , by Dr.
Samuel M. Jackson	PERSON	, of
Huldreich Zwingli	PERSON	, the Reformer of German Switz - erland .

		If the author had '' tried to be impartial '' with somewhat less zeal , it might have been better for his work .

		We may fairly question whether one who writes the biography of a '' Hero of the Refor - mation '' should pride himself on having '' avoided eulogy . ''

		It is a book of so much information and such rich pictorial equipment that one regrets the pervading consciousness that care was being taken by Professor
Jackson	PERSON	not to forget that
Zwingli	PERSON	must be kept in a rank below Luther .

		And this care is the less warranted in view of the admission in the Preface : '' If the four great continental re - formers Luther ,
Melanchthon	LOCATION	,
Zwingli	PERSON	, and
Cal	LOCATION	- vin should appear to-day , the one among them who would have to do least to adapt himself to our modern ways of thought , and the man who would soonest gather an enthusiastic following , would be
Huldreich Zwingli	PERSON	. ''

		Which seems very like an admission that
Zwingli	PERSON	was the most liberal and progressive of the four , as he probably was .

		He had faults enough .

		But is it sufficient reason for denying him an equality with Luther , that '' in his treatment of the Baptists he was prejudiced and cruel , his literary work is marred by haste , his jealousy of Luther was a mark of weakness , and in the latter part of his life he was more of a politician than he should have been '' ?

		Could not similar and more severe things be said of Luther and
Cal	LOCATION	- vin ?

		It has happened that Luther and
Calvin	PERSON	became the founders of greater organizations , and are better known to the world than
Zwingli	PERSON	.

		But circumstances , notably political and linguistic con - ditions , did much for the success of Luther 's mission .

		After reading the excellent resumS of
Zwingli	ORGANIZATION	's theology in Professor Foster 's supplementary chap - ter , the reader is inclined to regret that
Zwingli	PERSON	's views were not the ones to make the deepest im - pression on
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Zwingli was , all in all , a more admirable person , a man more after our modern hearts , than Luther .

		But the straining out of the historical background in a preliminary chapter , and of
Zwingli	ORGANIZATION	's theology in a supplementary chapter , together with the anxious abstinence from eulogy , have made the account cold and unsympathetic , though withal valuable .

		Professor
Vincent	PERSON	's survey of the condition of
Switzerland	LOCATION	at the beginning of the sixteenth century is of itself excellent , and the fine press-work and the thirty-three half-tone illus - trations add greatly to the pleasure of the reader .

		An important aid Professor

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and is to be congratulated upon the successful issue of a laborious and none too
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 exhilarating task .

		The volumes furnish an addi - tional evidence of the serious purpose and scientific depth of the experimental methods as applied to the problems of psychology , and no less of the close relations between the pursuit of the fundamental mental problems by other and more historic meth - ods .

		The method is here wisely subordinated to the end , without sacrificing precision , and yet without distorting the essential nature of the subject - material .

		To the small literature of distinctly pedagogical aids to laboratory psychology , this manual comes as a very weighty contribution and one destined to influence in no slight measure the progress of the teaching of psychology in the uni - versities of the country .

		Like all such volumes , what is offered will be more available to one instruc - tor than to another ; and each must choose and adapt and cut his garment according to his cloth .

		Yet the advantage of a trustworthy and expert guide in an intricate and somewhat unexplored country is unmistakable , though the ultimate success of the expedition will depend upon the tact and insight and ingenuity of the user of the guide .

		Professor Titchener offers a guide both for the teacher and the taught .

		The two volumes are in reality independent works , and the ground covered by the instructor 's manual is more extensive and more thoroughly explored than the general outline for the students .

		The former makes possible the training of advanced students in an apprenticeship to their specialty .

		Together , the present volumes contain the qualitative parts of the work , and will be followed in good season by a complementary portion treating of the quantitative methods and the problems to which they are applicable .

		There is much originality in the plan and in the mode of its execution ; yet the test of time and experience will be necessary to prove the applicability of these volumes to actual needs .

		Their scholarship , origi - nality , and grasp of the problems treated is sufficient to bespeak for them a favorable reception among the group of special teachers of psychology for whom they are primarily intended .

		The Life of
William Pitt	PERSON	, Lord StfSSL .


Chatham	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Walford Davis Green	PERSON	, appears in the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		None of the biog - raphies thus far issued in this series -LRB- except natur - ally those of
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee	PERSON	, and
Columbus	LOCATION	-RRB- should command a keener interest among American readers than this story of the Great Commoner , whose career was so closely connected with the colonial expansion of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and '' whose name was as beloved in
America	LOCATION	as it was feared in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Green	PERSON	's narrative is of course rapid and condensed ; but he allows himself con - siderable detail in recounting the events of the four memorable years from
1757	DATE	to
1761	DATE	, when
Pitt	PERSON	's war ministry '' raised
Great Britain	LOCATION	from despond - ency to the position of first nation in the world , '' and when '' from a condition of lethargy and COn - .

		FGr tludentt of Shakttptart and of law .

		fusion her army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	had been urged to victory after victory in three continents and on every ocean . ''

		The sub-title '' Growth and Division of the British Empire '' suggests that later period in
Chatham	LOCATION	's career when he tried in vain to shape the Govern - ment 's policy toward its revolting colonies into something like justice and conciliation .

		No true American can read without emotion , or can ever forget , the burning , passionate words with which he pleaded for fairness toward the kin beyond sea .

		``
Chatham	LOCATION	's insight into the American character was the outcome of deep affection and sympathy ; to him they were not ` our subjects , ' but Englishmen who still loved the tones of that deep chord which Hampden smote , they were ewes
Romani	PERSON	, men of the true race , of like faith and passions with him - self . '

		There , ' he wrote of
America	LOCATION	, ' there where I had garnered up my heart ' '' Mr.
Green	PERSON	's clear and sympathetic narrative admirably supplements the previous
Chatham	LOCATION	literature which consisted mainly of
Francis Thackeray	PERSON	's '' History of
William Pitt	PERSON	'' -LRB- 1827 -RRB- ,
Macaulay	PERSON	's famous essay , and the four volumes of Correspondence issued by the ex - ecutors of the younger
Pitt	PERSON	.

		Lovers of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic writings , and those who delight to trace the history of the struggle over the jurisdiction of equity between the courts of chancery and those of the common law , will read with more than usual interest the Hon.
Charles E. Phelps	PERSON	's '' Falstaff and Equity , an Interpretation '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Taking as his text the words used by Falstaff in the second scene of the second act of
I. Henry IVi	ORGANIZATION	, '' An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards , there 's no equity stirring , '' Judge
Phelps	PERSON	undertakes to explain a joke in a manner which gives it new point and added signifi - cance .

		In doing this , he is induced to investigate the records at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, and particularly the court records in which the Shakespeares father , mother , and son William figure promi - nently ; and from them he is able to show , in a convincing manner , some of the crudities of judicial procedure in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time , and out of the experiences of this litigation to account for the re - mark , '' There 's no equity stirring , '' which is put into Falstaff 's month at an opportune moment , designed doubtless as a '' gag , '' but involving also a nice criticism on the English courts in the admin - istration of justice .

		The discussion by Judge
Phelpa	PERSON	is clear and masterful .

		His argument is original , and shows painstaking investigation and careful research .

		His contentions are copiously fortified with footnote references which , to students of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and of the law , give to the volume be - fore us additional value .

		An appendix gives the record evidence of the Shakespeare litigation re - ferred to in the text ; and reference is also made , chronologically , to the war between the courts .

		The book is a valuable contribution to the subjects to which it relates .

		404 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, The Diplomacy The ''
Pickett Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' made famous of the Southern in
1872	DATE	by their purchase from the Confederacy .

		Confederate general of that name for the '' Rebel Archives '' of the
United States	LOCATION	, have found a use in addition to their regular service of saving the government money in settling war claims .

		Dr.
James Martin Callahan	PERSON	has made them a basis for a '' Diplomatic History of the Southern Confederacy '' -LRB- The
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Press -RRB- .

		Being prepared primarily as a course of university lec - tures , the matter is tersely written , closely based on original material , and replete with references .

		The sad chronicle of the high hopes with which the Confederacy entered upon its task of securing the aid of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and the delay and disappointment which it finally met with , is made out in a kindly spirit from the documents and let - ters .

		One follows the alternating despair and hope of its representatives abroad , and sees each feeling reflected in the officials at home . ''

		The bane and curse of carrying out anything in this country , '' writes
Thompson	PERSON	of '' Northern city-burning '' fame , from
Canada	LOCATION	, '' is the surveillance under which we act .

		Detectives stand at every corner . ''

		The author , in the few places in which he allows himself to in - trude personal opinion into the mass of evidence , thinks that the common people in
England	LOCATION	could not be won to support the Confederacy , notwith - standing the cotton famine , because they were irrevocably opposed to slavery ; that
Davis	PERSON	and the other leaders would have been willing to sacrifice slavery at last to gain
England	LOCATION	, but it was too late ; that
Napoleon	PERSON	used duplicity toward the Confede - racy 's representatives ; and that the second election of Lincoln blasted whatever hopes of foreign aid the cause might have previously entertained .

		In addition to its occupying a new field , this history is a scholarly and trustworthy production .

		Another book by Mr.
Cyrus Town	PERSON	- 8end
Brady	ORGANIZATION	gives us a sheaf of the author 's personal experiences by land and sea , grouped under the title of '' Under Tops ` ls and Tents '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		From the Auto - biographical Note prefixed to the volume it appears that Mr.
Brady	PERSON	has been what may fairly be termed an `` all-round man . ''

		He has been in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	; he has been in the '' railroad business '' and in the Church ; he is now '' in litera - ture , '' and there is no telling where he will turn up next .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's pen has been very busy for the past twelvemonth , but there is no sign as yet of flagging forces or a depleted literary exchequer .

		A fine flow of spirits and a manifest relish of his own good stories is as apparent in his latest book as in his first .

		Of course we do not mean to say that Mr.
Brady	PERSON	is a mere jester , for there is pathos as well as mirth in the best of his stories a reflection of life 's
April	DATE	weather .

		The contents of the present volume are divided under such headings as '' Where Admirals Are Made , '' '' Out With the United States Volunteers , '' and '' Stories of
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	Life . ''

		Essentially the book is a reflection of the author 's experiences as a naval cadet at
Annapolis	LOCATION	and on the school-ships , and as a chaplain in camp and at the front during the war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	turns the kaleidoscope of memory with pleasing and often dramatic effect , and his stories are sweet - ened by the suggestion of the humane and cheery personality behind them .

		A picture of Napoleon at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	's ''
Napoleon	PERSON	, the Last Phase '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a brilliant presentation of the great prisoner in exile .

		The author spares no pains to get at the facts of those strange years .

		He takes up the Napoleonic literature which grew out of those last days , and subjects it to the sharpest criticism .

		The chronicles of Las Cases ,
O'Meara	PERSON	,
Antommarchi	LOCATION	,
Gourgand	LOCATION	,
Lady Malcolm	LOCATION	, and all the rest of them , are critically examined .

		In fact , this is one of the great points of the book .

		After the sources have been thus carefully weighed and the chaff blown out of them ,
Lord Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	gives us a very dis - criminating estimate of Napoleon in his strange environment on that lone isle .

		He presents a study of the gradual pining away of the high mental and physical strength of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, and leaves the facts in such form that every reader can paint his own picture , not only of the external conditions at
Longwood	LOCATION	, but of what was passing in the mind of the dethroned exile .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	does not spare the petty English governor of the island , nor does he seem to show favoritism toward anything but the truth .

		In the final summing up of
Napoleon	PERSON	and Democracy -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- , the author says : `` Au - thoritative democracy , or , in other words , demo - cratic dictatorship , the idea which produced the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, which is still alive there , and which , in various forms , has found favor else - where , is the political legacy , perhaps the final message , of Napoleon . ''

		Each is interpreted historically , and , so far as possible , by extracts from classical litera - ture Homer most of all .

		The interpretations are unforced , reasonable , and convincing , being kept well within the knowledge of the unlearned , and simple enough for children quite unskilled in myth and fable .

		All the more familiar examples of Greek art are included , with the exception of the
Diana	PERSON	of the
Louvre	LOCATION	, and several not so generally
1901	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 405 known .
